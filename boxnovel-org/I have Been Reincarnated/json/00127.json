A feeling of admiration rose in his heart as he smiled wryly.</p><br/><p>\u201d It is really as awesome\u2026! It looks like there are endless guest rooms and to think that each room is fitted with a magical tool that lights up! And above all\u2026 how elegant! \u201d</p><br/><p>Having grown up in a magical tool shop, Zen knew.</p><br/><p>All the magical tools in this house were of the highest grade. The mana stone attached were huge too. Of course, it would cost some to get them in the first place but they were also a testimony to how well the tools were being taken care of.</p><br/><p>And if you looked closely, each magical tool had been there for some time now.</p><br/><p>The Beryl family were part of the founding of Elzmu and these tools might most possibly be of that period. When Zen\u2019s thought went into that direction, he started getting excited as his heart pounded.</p><br/><p>Above all, everyone in this house was so elegant. So different from those nobles who visited his shop while complaining all the while. Even Will called himself as [Boku].</p><br/><p>[TN: Basically, 3 forms for the word I/me for guys. Watashi, Boku and Ore.]</p><br/><p>Zen had thought he heard wrongly the first time. Will had spoken like all others when he was at school\u2026 and all of a sudden, Will, who usually spoke in a much ruder way, became very noble-like.</p><br/><p>As Zen was admiring how Will could change in an instant, he then thought about those Nobles who visited his shop and when compared, they did sounded like a lot lower in hierarchy which depressed him.</p><br/><p>He was very troubled when those Nobles visited his shop but he had always thought that they were one of the highest rank, and it turned out that they were of the lowest.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sigh\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen let out another sigh as he unpacked.</p><br/><p>\u201d Come to think of it\u2026 I wondered if Father\u2019s okay.. I\u2019m really worried about him. But I had pretended to be cool in front of Ruby-neesan and said that I would not return until I graduate.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen\u2019s eyes glazed over as he thought about his father in Sociunnov\u2019s land. Maybe he should had gone back during summer holidays.</p><br/><p>But, he had spoken big words before he enrolled into the academy. As his childhood friend, a cat beastman, Ruby-neesan and his father were worrying about him, he had told them \u201d It\u2019s okay~ I would have graduate before you even know it. And then I would come back with my cert! \u201c.</p><br/><p>All men (boys) did this kind of stuff.</p><br/><p>Even for Zen, whose head floated in the clouds, had a silver of pride. Plus, even if it was still unknown to him, Zen liked Ruby. Because he had always treated Ruby as his older sister who looked after him since he was young, he did not realized that he liked her. Although Zen was air-headed, he was not thick. Unlike someone else.</p><br/><p>And that Ruby-neesan must be looking after his father on his behalf right now. If it was really the case, Zen felt sorry for troubling her.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will\u2019s father is really awesome\u2026. and so cool\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to his father\u2026. Zen\u2019s shoulders fell but his eyes sparkled.</p><br/><p>Gion sudden appearance and his unusual display of him rubbing Will\u2019s cheek was slightly weird, but it was really cool how Gion would simply shifted back into a serious look. And to add on to that the title of being the NO.1 strongest in Elzmu, it was enough to make anyone admired him.</p><br/><p>Gion was so cool that even Zen, who\u2019s a dude, would fell for him.</p><br/><p>He could finally understand everything Selphy and Mi had told him fervently about how awesome [Gion-Sama] was. But thinking back, Selphy seems to not been as shocked to see [Gion-Sama] as he expected. Zen wondered what happened.</p><br/><p>Had she grew tired of [Gion-Sama]?</p><br/><p>\u201d Hmm\u2026.~ \u201d</p><br/><p>As various thoughts ran through his head, Zen finished unpacking and stretched. He had managed to do the unpacking himself after rejecting the maids by saying that it wasn\u2019t a lot.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d I just thought I could try that out! That was when Will-Sama was around 4 years old. Hehehe. \u201d</p><br/><p>Under Chiffon guidance, Selphy headed towards the guest room meant for her. And on the way, Chiffon had been telling her all sorts of stuff with a teehee~ face and she was really surprised at what was said.</p><br/><p>When they reached the mansion, Selphy felt a gaze upon her. Elves, who lived in the forest, were beings that were very sensertive to any presence and gazes.</p><br/><p>And to add on, Will, who had turned from a ruffian to an elegant noble.</p><br/><p>The combination of those 2 points shook Selphy so badly that she did not even have the time to notice [Gion-Sama], who she had been fervently praising on the way here. She had used up all of her effort in just pretending that she was calm.</p><br/><p>For a 10 year old, that alone was worthy of praise. She wasn\u2019t Will\u2019s friend for nothing.</p><br/><p>And then in came that comment.</p><br/><p>What else could go red apart from the face? Eyes? Bunnies? But Will, who possessed a very cute looking face coupled with a matured personality, had taken in the beastman girl standing in front of Selphy as a pet?</p><br/><p>And even hugged her gently?</p><br/><p>And even muttered sweet nothings about a promise for the future\u2026. What?! What was going on??!!</p><br/><p>Although Selphy did not know all the small details at her age, there were many faeries who spoke about these kind of stuff in great excitement when she was living in her village. Even Senpais in school or staying in the dormitory would go kya- kya- over this topic.</p><br/><p>Although she still had no idea what that was, it must be something to let people go kya- kya- over it. And it was something that let people went red.</p><br/><p>The very first time Selphy had spoken to Will was on that night. She thought back to the smile Will gave her after saving her from the chattering faeries.</p><br/><p>Her head felt like bursting apart.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well~ then. We shall get started on unpacking once we reached the room! Would that be alright? \u201d</p><br/><p>Chiffon asked Selphy, who had sunk into her own thoughts the entire way there.</p><br/><p>Selphy, who was in a daze, caught the sight of Chiffon placing her luggage onto a knee-high table set perfectly in the middle of the room as her soft and bushy tail wagged to and fro.</p><br/><p>Then Chiffon, who was standing behind the sofa right next to the table, seemed to be beckoning Selphy towards the sofa. Sorry to be rude to the smiling Chiffon, but she looked like a villain in Selphy\u2019s eyes. Selphy sat on the sofa timidly, her heart beating wildly as she wondered if Chiffon was going to do anything to her.</p><br/><p>\u201d What is Will-Sama like in school? \u201d</p><br/><p>Chiffon asked, as she took clothing out of Selphy\u2019s luggage. Selphy blanked out for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm\u2026.right\u2026yes, very mature and kind, but funny as well. He even have a fan club. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah~\u2026. As I thought, he had one. \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy was troubled over what to answer. After imagining Will doing that sort of stuff to Chiffon, she was afraid that she would say something weird if it was of her own opinion so she chose the \u2018official\u2019 answer from others in school.</p><br/><p>But Chiffon\u2019s reply, that she expected it, had revealed the time they spend together and also how close the both of them were. Dealing with the stifling feeling in her heart, Selphy continued saying things she don\u2019t really want to.</p><br/><p>\u201d And, I was saved by Will when I was about to be killed at a school festival. At that time, Will used an umbrella as a weapon so he is being called the [Prince of Umbrella] in school recently. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh~! So Selphy-San too, by Will-sama\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Chiffon\u2019s thoughts wandered away as her eyes glazed over. Seeing the happy look on her face, Selphy felt like she lost.</p><br/><p>It was quite ridiculous to be comparing.</p><br/><p>Selphy pulled herself up and treated this chance as way to get to know a Will she had never seen before.</p><br/><p>\u201d Was Chiffon-San saved by Will too? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026 I knew nothing when I first came into this house. I was a failure as a maid and honestly, I had no confidence I could do this. And at that time, Will-Sama was the one who supported me. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Supported you? In what way? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d About that\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>When 3 woman get together, something was bound to happened. When 2 woman get together, there was a very high possibility that the very same thing would happened.</p><br/><p>The 2 of them then proceeded with their girl\u2019s talk about the tales of Will in high spirits, stuff that if Will was to overheard, his face would be flushed red in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

With well-trained muscular body, yet was surprisingly nimble, moving without any futile movements.</p><br/><p>One of them was small and slender to the point you would mistake as a child. However, the movements were too polished to be one.</p><br/><p>The last one of them had no particular features. Average height, average figure. A silhouette that no one remembered despite seeing it multiple times. However, the agility shown was astounding.</p><br/><p>\u201d Here? \u201d</p><br/><p>Slender murmured and Average nodded. The 3 of them looked up at the tall and sturdy wall, the height and thickness similar to the castle wall.</p><br/><p>Tall suddenly grabbed Slender and\u2026 Threw Slender up, who then landed on the top of the wall perfectly, just like a cat.</p><br/><p>Silently throwing down a rope, Slender pulled both of them up at once, displaying strength disproportionate to that slender figure.</p><br/><p>In a low murmur, like saying it was just in case, Tall chanted.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300a\u300b\u201d [TN: Kage, Shadow]</p><br/><p>And the 3 bodies just melted into darkness.</p><br/><p>Not careless, yet not tense.</p><br/><p>Used to this, yet not letting down their guard.</p><br/><p>No gap in their attack, with more than enough to spare.</p><br/><p>The 3 who were obviously pro in this field calmly walked into the premises.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014A few hours before, at dawn\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Like always, I took Mary-san\u2019s hand and we walked to the dining room.</p><br/><p>This me had turned 4 years old!</p><br/><p>Before I even realized, a year had passed and it was time for my birthday party again. Time passed so fast! Thinking back to a year ago, it was all thanks to the birthday debut that I had made a friend. Ah\u2026 to think how nervous I was that day.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Rather than that, I was already 4 years old so please stop with the hand holding! How embarrassing! Please stop\u2026</p><br/><p>But how did I tell her..!?</p><br/><p>Every time I saw how she looked at me, like she looked at her grandchild, I could never get myself to say it. The hand holding was fine at 3 years old since my walking was still unstable but it was about time to stop\u2026</p><br/><p>If it remained like this, I was afraid that this matter would simply be dragged out forever.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sigh\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I slumped over the table.</p><br/><p>There was no lesson today. John-sensei\u2019s mother seemed to be in a critical state due to her illness and he had to go back home. I only came to know about that this morning. Sensei apologized and left after breakfast.</p><br/><p>Recently, I had been having sword lessons with Father and just as I was thinking of doing that today, something seemed to have happened at work. With his subordinates, he left the house in a hurry.</p><br/><p>For some reason, everything had piled up today and Mother left too, for an engagement at a tea party.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2019s with today\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Like that, only the maids were left in this house. As lately this time of the day was when I was having my lessons, the maids learned to avoid this time to play with me. But they would find out sooner or later.</p><br/><p>And now, I needed to face a problem straight on.</p><br/><p>Did I stay like this, in the room and play with the maids after so long, or did I run?</p><br/><p>\u201d Hmm.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Even though I said that I would need to face it, the decision had long been made.</p><br/><p>And that was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d Here we go~ \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.To run away!</p><br/><p>I walked along the long corridor, heading to the library that I had become familiar with. Ah, even though I called it a library, it was just a room. A room right next to the office.</p><br/><p>Hm\u2026No matter what, I did not think the maids would enter into the office\u2026</p><br/><p>I entered the library and set up a detection magic around 10m radius. With the incantations being Japanese, it really helped with my spy activities, DS for short, around the house. Why my abbreviated name sounded like a game\u2026</p><br/><p>[TN: DS is short for \u30b9\u30d1\u30a4 Kateinai Spy Katsuou, I think maybe the author thinks Kateinai is spelled with a D.]</p><br/><p>Anyway, for now, if anyone triggered the magic, they were set up to be teleported into the office next door.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300a\u300b\u201d [TN: Shunkanidou Yoyaku, Teleportation Contract.]</p><br/><p>I chanted just in case, as this was the first time I was casting this magic. Contract\u2026I could feel the extent of my vocabulary but needlessly using complex words are simply Chunnibyo-like..</p><br/><p>Umm\u2026.This was hard..</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s start thinking!</p><br/><p>Even though no one could understand it anyway since it\u2019s in Japanese but\u2026Meh, the mood was important.</p><br/><p>The me alone nodded to myself and started fishing for books.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>That was this morning.</p><br/><p>I let out a breath and closed the thick book. With [Poison\u30fbStrong Poison Let\u2019s Make] as the title.</p><br/><p>[TN: Japanese Dokuyaku\u30fbGekiyaku Yakuyakusho]</p><br/><p>What a puny puny sounding title but it turned out to be very useful. It was filled with different medicines and poison, their effects and how to counter them. In this world, there also existed narcotic-like effects plants. It was called Mayaku. \u2026How direct.</p><br/><p>[TN: Narcotic plants \u2013 Mayaku , the Mayaku here is , direct translation is Magic Meds]</p><br/><p>When I realized it, the sky was already dark and I was wrapped in silence.</p><br/><p>\u2026Oh no. If I did not return soon I was going to cause an uproar\u2026 I stood up, preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>Ping! Something like a string snapped inside my head. The magic contract I made was activated.</p><br/><p>At the next moment, I entered into the office.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b</p><br/><p>[TN: Anshi, night vision.]</p><br/><p>I activated my magic chantlessly in the dark room, unlit by any lamps. As the room lit up in my eyes, I casted another magic on myself.</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b</p><br/><p>[TN: Kehai Shometsu, Presence Camouflage]</p><br/><p>I erased any sounds I might make with magic.</p><br/><p>The maids would never come into this part of the house. Plus, Father was not in right now. Mother and John, who had the highest probability, had not returned home yet.</p><br/><p>Trying to control my pounding heart in my chest, I took a deep breath before looking around the room.</p><br/><p>The presence\u2026presence\u2026\u2026 There.</p><br/><p>I sensed a tiny presence at the side of the room, where the bookshelf stood. Even though I could not see them, I could sense their mana.</p><br/><p>\u2026. There were 3 of them.</p><br/><p>I did not know who they were, but right now, just when Father was not around, they were fishing around the documents in a pitch black room. It was evident. They were unwelcome guests.</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b</p><br/><p>[TN: Mahou Kouka Toushi, Magic Effect Vision, to see through any magic the opponent is using]</p><br/><p>They had used magic to hide their figures. I could now see their figures, which were hidden in shadows, clearly.</p><br/><p>A group of 3, wearing skin-hugging black clothes, just like a ninja. A 2m giant, a slender man and a man with an average figure.</p><br/><p>Without noticing me, one of them raised a document in his hands. I did not know what they were looking for, but there was a lot of confidential documents in here. Plus, I had a bad feeling. Everything was starting to feel like too much of a coincidence.</p><br/><p>I set up a barrier and strengthened my body. Increased the processing of thoughts. Agility up.</p><br/><p>After doing all that I could, I readied myself. I had to do this now. If I was too slow and they escaped then all would be lost.</p><br/><p>Controlling my trembling voice, I said.</p><br/><p>\u201d May I kindly ask what you are doing? \u201d</p><br/><p>It might be possible that Father\u2019s subordinate had an urgent reason for being here.</p><br/><p>Mehh\u2026The possibility was very low though.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>But\u2026\u2026\u2026It seemed like I did not need to worry about that.</p><br/><p>The slender person let loose something.</p><br/><p>I did not know if my barrier would repel it but my strengthened body reflexively avoided the trajectory and making use of the momentum, I slipped behind him in an instant using my accelerated speed. Jumping up, I hit the back of his neck. At the same moment, I heard the sound of metal piercing the wall.</p><br/><p>\u2026As I thought, a projectile weapon\u2026 That was dangerous\u2026</p><br/><p>There was no time to calm myself.</p><br/><p>There was only an instant during the surprise they felt when they saw one of them was easily beaten. Seeing my small stature, it looked like they decided to go for close combat. In response, they made a wooden hand knife from the table. They must be thinking that no matter how much enhancement I casted, I could not make up for my weight.</p><br/><p>How\u2026\u2026 Naive.</p><br/><p>I manipulated the gravity, weighing down Mr.Average as he slashed at me. Surprised with the unexpected weight, he jumped back. Without losing a moment, Mr.Giant let loose a roundhouse kick. I jumped to avoid so now, the only way was down. In that case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026 Ha! \u201d</p><br/><p>Stepping on air for the momentum, I crashed into Mr.Giant\u2019s nose with my knee. With a huge noise, he crumbled on the floor, seeing how I just gave him a brain concussion.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026..!? \u201d</p><br/><p>Mr.Average looked like he had no idea what just happened. Aiming for the moment when he flinched from surprise, I casted my magic.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300a\u300b\u201d [TN: Kousoku, Restrain]</p><br/><p>The 3 were then bound by an invisible thread. I was magic itself!</p><br/><p>Ah, I could not let my guard down yet.</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b[TN: Kihai Sacchi, presence radar]</p><br/><p>I spread my magic as far as it could go, trying to check if there was any accomplice.</p><br/><p>\u201d ..Haaaah\u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I let loose a deep breath, strength all gone from my shoulders. I deactivated all magic casted on myself except for the barrier, just in case.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t be waking up anytime soon I think\u2026 Just, just, just in case, I manipulated the gravity, weighting them down to their limit. That might be too much, but it was just self-defense.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>I really tried my best! I didn\u2019t know if they were small fries or not but a 4 year old kid defeated 3 grown-ups!</p><br/><p>Mama mia!</p><br/><p>[TN: Really in the novel. No translation needed for this one!]</p><br/><p>I wanna praise myself!</p><br/><p>My relaxed face due to my good mood stiffened when I saw the dozens of knife-like weapons stuck deep into the wall. Oh, did I draw back at that.</p><br/><p>Wo..Wouldn\u2019t you come back home faster, Father?</p><br/><p>[TN: 1st time seeing him yell for his father.]</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: Activating his [cheat] for his first battle.</p><br/><p>\u2026This had been difficult.</p><br/><p>TN: I agree.</p><br/><p>Since this is the chapter the [shadows] appeared, I\u2019ve updated the char bios at the main page. Enjoy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

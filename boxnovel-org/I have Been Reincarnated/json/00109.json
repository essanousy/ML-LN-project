I finally went out and found a place with better wifi.</p><br/><p>I have bad news. I might not be able to meet the schedule of 1 update every 3 days. It might be once per week\u2026.. Sorry.</p><br/><p>Entering the classroom, I buried my head in studying for trying to avoid answering that question. My aim right now was trying to master every single details about the geography and the climate of Elzmu.</p><br/><p>Be it the preparation for managing the territory or following in my Father\u2019s footsteps of being an adventurer first, geography was a must. Plus, knowing the detailed information about various places was needed to properly manage a territory. Otherwise, it would be difficult to survive.</p><br/><p>For harmony, victory or defeat, information was valuable and extremely important. Ah\u2026although I was not thinking of completing now.</p><br/><p>No matter, there was no disadvantage to learning.</p><br/><p>I was thinking of taking out the book from the table that John-sensei passed me if I ever felt like learning about climate or geography. Zen, sitting next to me, peeked over and when he saw me opening the first page, he gave a deep sigh and started his self-study.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Would this be that thing, the common knowledge that every lower acad knew about Elzmu?</p><br/><p>I had no common knowledge. I was quite self-aware that my knowledge was quite one-sided. \u2026..The friends I had till now was limited to John-sensei or Chiffon\u2026. Let\u2019s stop. I don\u2019t want to think about it.</p><br/><p>By the way, as for Selphy, she made a face as if she stepped on a bug and left the moment she saw me taking out the book.</p><br/><p>After staying like that for a while, the front of the classroom started getting noisy. It would be weird for them to be this noisy if it was only Zelda-sensei appearing. Could it be\u2026he finally got rid of the unfitting suit he always wore?!</p><br/><p>I lifted my head up as I thought about those rude stuff. But, still, I could see nothing. But those guys in front of them were looking down at the floor, pointing at it.</p><br/><p>\u201d Is there a snake there or something\u2026\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>That the same moment I mumbled to myself, it jumped onto the teacher\u2019s desk.</p><br/><p>\u201d Everyone from the first year White team, are you all here? Today, I have an announcement from my master. Please head over to the gymnasium. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, he bowed and left the classroom smartly as he left the rest there, mouth agape.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.Wasn\u2019t he\u2026. wasn\u2019t he Alcumedes-san?!!!</p><br/><p>It appeared that Alcumedes-san had informed the rest of the classes as well as when we were out into the corridor, discussion about a \u2018walking eyeball\u2019 could be heard. Part of them were excitedly discussing about the topic about \u2018My Master\u2019 while the rest were walking as if they were in a daze.</p><br/><p>I wondered what would happen if they knew that \u2018The Master\u2019 was referring to the King.</p><br/><p>Apart from getting curious and really looking forward to any amusing reaction, and also since there was no way to escape, I obediently headed towards the gym.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will, what do you think about this~? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen asked.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm\u2026.I wonder\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I would be exposed if I were to give a weird answer so I simple tilted my head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, so you don\u2019t know anything too~ Yeah. I wonder when Zelda-sensei changed into that\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Huh?!</p><br/><p>What did he say just now?! Zelda-sensei\u2026?!</p><br/><p>Although I did not pay attention to the first half, why did the conversation suddenly change direction? Why did it suddenly bounce over to the Zelda-sensei?!</p><br/><p>\u201d No, I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s it!! \u201d</p><br/><p>I think I accidentally revealed something just now but without minding it, I simply gave my all into retorting. I was surprised. Onii-san was really surprised, you know. People from other worlds really had some weird ideas. So the alternate world was a place where a normal teacher can turn into a talking eyeball. Onii-chan just experienced cultural shock.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh? \u201d</p><br/><p>Both Zen and Selphy tilted their head at my retort and looked at me, puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Ah, my head hurt. Yep.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, you see, even if Zelda-sensei has that kind of magic, is there even a need to change his voice as well? Right? \u201d</p><br/><p>Halfway through my rather reasonable explanation, my tone started to press them into agreeing. And then\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d Besides, that Eyeball-san said \u2018My Master\u2019, didn\u2019t he? I am more concerned about that. \u201d</p><br/><p>I skilfully diverted the question and even led them into the direction I wanted. Yep, since everyone had their own interpretation, it was not that important to correct them. Retorting just about this level would be enough, wouldn\u2019t it? And really, it was impossible to not retort since that comment was practically asking for it.</p><br/><p>Hearing someone shouted \u2018 The Master for Eyeball is most definitely the Brain! \u2018, I sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>The gymnasium was the place where the entrance ceremony was held. Once there, seats were prepared and it was almost full. It appeared that, the same as the entrance ceremony, everyone here was from the 1st year of lower academy. Come to think of it, it had only been 2 months since I entered school. It felt a lot longer to me, maybe because of how densely packed each day was.</p><br/><p>But, even if was only 2 months, it still meant a lot. Especially for children of my age.</p><br/><p>To boys and girls 10 years of age, 2 months would feel long. Not only the mind, but everyone\u2019s body had grown, their weight increased and even their faces grew sharper and more adult-like.</p><br/><p>But now, with their faces bathed in curiosity with what little information they had, they looked like innocent children.</p><br/><p>Eh? Me? \u2026I\u2019m, yep.</p><br/><p>I looked down. The height till the floor remained unchanged!</p><br/><p>\u2026..Ah, anyway, I was still only 8! Father\u2019s tall as I definitely still have that future!</p><br/><p>As I looked around me, someone tugged at my sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will, are you sitting? :\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, it was the rare-upturned-eye look from Selphy! The best position was born when Selphy took a seat! Ha ha! At this moment, I was the taller one!!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Let\u2019s stop this. It would only made me feel empty.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes. \u201d</p><br/><p>As all of that ran through my mind, I quietly took a seat.</p><br/><p>It was the moment when our chat about B-grade food turned to Fried Dragon Meat. The noisy gymnasium quietened down as all the students raised their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201d Everyone, you did well in assembling. \u201d</p><br/><p>In the quiet gymnasium, a deep baritone voice resounded, causing ripples in the air. And then, one by one, everyone who raised their head had their jaws dropped opened. Plus, there were some who had their eyes wide, even some who lay slumped in their seats.</p><br/><p>Ah, but of course. Since the face from the pictures and magazines they had seen since young was right in front of them.</p><br/><p>And the one who smiled, satisfied at the reaction, was our King Kesamu.</p><br/><p>I did feel his charisma when I was conversing with him in his private room but seeing him here, in all his glory, made me truly felt that he was the King. And when I realized it, there were mana drifting all around King Kesamu. Only, there was no malice in it, and was simply sparkling.</p><br/><p>And it was as though time stopped, as the gymnasium was wrapped in silence, drunk in his aura. Then, in an instant, he suppressed his mana and smiled gently.</p><br/><p>\u2026..e, Eh?</p><br/><p>I somehow had a feeling that our eyes met but it couldn\u2019t be, right? If he possessed my cheat-enhanced vision then I could understand but this\u2026had to be a joke right? And him grinning after seeing I was surprised by our eyes meeting was also a joke right?</p><br/><p>And it was as if my wishes were heard by the heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201d I come over regarding about the Swimming Tournament. \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015And, before that. \u201d</p><br/><p>King Kesamu paused and a smile floated up onto his face as though he remembered something about our meeting before glancing at me. Naturally, everyone\u2019s line of sight changed their direction to me.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.What was this?? A punishment game??!!!!</p><br/><p>Why did I feel like the student representative of the entire school body when they were doing the radio calisthenics?! My face was all red due to embarrassment and misery! Kesamu-san!!!!! My height would stand out if I was looked at this much! I would be looked down upon! I would be totally looked down upon!!</p><br/><p>As if having heard the scream of the bottom of my heart, King Kesamu finally shifted his line of sight away from me. And with slow motions, he looked at the Headmaster.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eidus, I borrowed one of your student a while back. I have caused him trouble, regarding homework as well, do take care of him. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.Oi.</p><br/><p>I mumbled in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Headmaster once again, glanced at me before snapping his glance back, with such a force that a sound effect could be heard. My mouth could only twitched with a wry smile.</p><br/><p>Since it was a national secret, I had even tried my utmost to keep it under wraps!! Because of that, I even withstood Selphy\u2019s smile and Varino-sensei freezing attacks!! What was the reason for me doing that?!!</p><br/><p>\u201d The Swimming Tournament is not simply a swimming race. Magic, strategy, strength, the aim of this tournament is to use your imagination and creativity to win. Everyone, you are most probably aiming to be an adventurer. An adventurer is often working alongside of danger. Thanks to that, it is not a job that only requires you to only use your strong point. You would need to have the techniques to face danger head on. And that, swimming. There is almost no one in Elzmu who knows how to swim. But, that is where creativity shines. \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015And what is the reason why our First Founder, King Elzmu founded this tournament. And that, I want all of you to deliberate about how you are to enter the tournament. \u201d</p><br/><p>When I covered my face with my hands when I was unable to withstand the gazes from everyone, King Kesamu began to talk about the Swimming Tournament.</p><br/><p>He said a lot about the origin and stuff but in the end, as expected, it was the First Founder\u2019s decision. Which meant, this was really just a way for him to relieve his youth. What? It was not that? Did you really believe that? Having learned about all the stuff he did before, wasn\u2019t it obvious that I was telling the truth?</p><br/><p>And right now, only one verse was taking all the place in my heart.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Return me my considerationnnnnnnnNNNN\u2026\u2026.!!!!!!!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That\u2019s great. That\u2019s really great. I was a little worried about them breaking free. Glancing at Sensei, he had a really surprised expression on as he approached the trio.</p><br/><p>\u201d This is\u2026 perhaps\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>His face turned pale as he murmured. He then looked over his shoulder with a force at me, eyes questioning.</p><br/><p>\u201d Are all 3 of them restrained? \u201d</p><br/><p>I finally understood why Sensei had such a weird expression on. I had forgotten to inform him that I had bound the intruders up. The bindings were weaved out of my mana and barrier magic and coiled up around them with an addition of gravity magic. Just by looking, no physical object could be seen restricting them.</p><br/><p>I scratched my neck and smiled sheepishly.</p><br/><p>In a joking sense, I answered \u2018Bound by a spoonful of magic and a bit of gravity.\u2019 but I guessed Sensei would not accept that.</p><br/><p>I then smiled teasingly.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I will explain it all to you later. \u201d</p><br/><p>Shifting our attention back to the trio, whose faces were covered with a black cloth, we looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026. Where should we even begin\u2026?</p><br/><p>We could not tell if they had regained their consciousness or not without seeing their faces\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d What should we do? \u201d</p><br/><p>Troubled, I tried to ask Sensei.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, I wonder what we could do\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei answered, with a troubled look.</p><br/><p>Oi oi. Why were you no help at all?</p><br/><p>\u2026Hah, anyone would be troubled if they were brought into this situation all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u2026Hmm.</p><br/><p>This situation would stay stuck forever if we did not know if they were awake or not! I had decided to throw away all of my unnecessary worry. Not only were they intruding into the house, they even attacked me so I was not in the wrong here! In any case, we should wake one up and get some information from them.</p><br/><p>You over there, please don\u2019t say I am horrible. To solve this case, I would be as humane as possible. At least I would not be as bad and use a knife as that guy in John Sensei\u2019s case!</p><br/><p>Observing the trio, I decided to get it out of Mr. Delicate. In terms of physique, he looked easier to handle.</p><br/><p>Just to say, the reason I did not choose Mr. Tall and Mr. Average was not because they looked like mob characters!</p><br/><p>I timidly approached Mr. Delicate and took off the hood \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2026 our eyes met.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah. \u201d</p><br/><p>I said in surprised.</p><br/><p>They looked like Ninja so I willfully thought all of them as guys but it was the face of a beautiful Onee-san under the hood. Although her face was twisted and glaring at me. When our eyes met, she opened her eyes wide in surprised.</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah, if I, as an assassin, was caught and the one to come into my sight was a child, I would be surprised too. Relieved, I stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah! \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei was somehow touching Onee-san\u2019s flank!</p><br/><p>Wait wait wait wait wait\u2026 What were you doing, Sensei! You could not do these kind of things even if you didn\u2019t have a girlfriend! Even if Onee-san was gorgeous! Even if she was extremely gorgeous!</p><br/><p>My inner mind was in chaos and as I was judging Sensei, at the timing where it was like he heard my thoughts, he looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Frowning.</p><br/><p>\u2026 I am sorry!</p><br/><p>I gulped my apologetic words down and was thankful for that when I heard what Sensei wanted to say.</p><br/><p>\u201d This person\u2019s bones are broken. Will, what kind of fighting did you do? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026. Eh? \u201d</p><br/><p>According to Sensei, just by touch alone, he had already felt a few broken ribs.</p><br/><p>I tilted my head, trying to remember yet nothing came to mind. All I could remember was only giving her a hand chop to the back of her neck.</p><br/><p>I casted a sidelong glance at Sensei, who began to question Onee-san.</p><br/><p>\u201d What was the reason to infiltrate this estate? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Was it the Veltor\u2019s? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Question after questions were asked but all Onee-san did was to glare at us. By then, Sensei was frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will, let us bring her into another room. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Sensei wanted to carry her up.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026 That heavy? \u201d</p><br/><p>As a scholar, Sensei was not gangly but even by using his full strength, he could not even move her\u2026. I was as surprised as Sensei before I remembered,</p><br/><p>\u2026Gravity magic!</p><br/><p>It had completely slipped my mind. Perhaps that was the reason why I did not notice Onee-san\u2019s ribs was broken.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ahahahaha. \u201d</p><br/><p>When it came to this\u2026 Laugh it off!</p><br/><p>I undid the gravity manipulation, as well as the bindings and realized something. This Onee-san was in a state where several of her ribs were broken and yet she could still withhold her silence \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 Was that not kinda strange?</p><br/><p>No matter how long it had been, Onee-san had no response whatsoever so Sensei decided to go on to plan B. I had no idea if the other 2 had come to or not but I heard that when separated from one\u2019s group, one would talk more easily. Might be due to how their feeling of solitary and uneasiness increased in that situation. I simply thought that it was because they were away from the stress of the other person ratting them out if they talked. It was fine to think simple.</p><br/><p>I nodded, left the other 2 in the office, and teleported the rest of us back into my room.</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah\u2026 It was better not to reveal my hand to the enemy\u2026</p><br/><p>I did it chantlessly, just in case.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the view changed into one of darkness. I could feel softness under my feet so this should be the place. As my eyes were not yet used to the darkness, it somehow seemed darker.</p><br/><p>When I switched the lamp on, we found ourselves standing on top of my sofa in my ridiculously large room.</p><br/><p>Ah, I wondered if it was safe to unbind her without checking first. This kind of Ninja-like person usually had concealed weapons, don\u2019t they?</p><br/><p>I jumped off the sofa and was heading towards Onee-san but found that Sensei was already searching through her clothes.</p><br/><p>O\u2026Oh\u2026.</p><br/><p>Since I had the same intentions, I would not misunderstand Sensei\u2019s action this time round. But\u2026 uh. This might be a bit too much for my eyes. But\u2026umu\u2026</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think I would be scolded if I turned my eyes away. Did Sensei do it because of me? No.. If he could read my mind then I would not be this troubled as I was right now\u2026 This was not the thoughts of a 4 years old kid\u2026 Ah, whatever.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Sensei reached out for Onee-san\u2019s neck as he spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201d As I predicted, this person is a \u2018Shadow\u2019. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Shadow? \u201d</p><br/><p>I tilted my head at the unknown word.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes. [Shadow] is the \u2018fixer\u2019 of the underworld. As long as there is a request, they will do anything, even assassination. They are the organization that operates in the dark, with no one ever seeing them before. \u201d</p><br/><p>Judging from what Will said, till now, she had not made a single sound which meant she was truly a professional, Sensei murmured as he felt round her neck. At the back of her high-neck collar, there was a clasp which Sensei undid.</p><br/><p>Ga-chink.</p><br/><p>It opened and her clothes fell down.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.. This is\u2026 ! \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei exclaimed in shock and directed his eyes, filled with doubt, at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026 Will, it\u2019s as I thought, the situation is unfavorable. \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei frowned as he gave a deep sigh, and glanced at Onee-san, who was still glaring at us.</p><br/><p>\u201d This item that is attached at her neck is mostly likely the [Collar of Slavery]. \u201d</p><br/><p>[Collar of Slavery] was, as the name implied, a collar that once attached, forced a person into slavery. Once an order was handed down, they would be given no choice but to obey. Orders like \u2018Kill the person in front of you\u2019 would be fulfilled even if the person himself lost conscious, as their body would move on its own, as commended by the collar.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the hair on my back stood straight up. Luckily, Onee-san could not move due to almost all of her bones being broken but otherwise, she would continue to move until she turned into mincemeat.</p><br/><p>\u2026. Was that not the same as a zombie?</p><br/><p>Sensei deduced that the reason why Onee-san was not making a sound was because of the collar. Who made something like this\u2026.! Anger rushed up and at the same time, an unfamiliar emotion that was very close to fear was felt. This was insane, the act of a devil.</p><br/><p>But the problem was, this collar could only be removed by the person that attached it on.</p><br/><p>\u201d Onee-san is a shadow? \u201d</p><br/><p>I asked, looking into her eyes. Her face was wearing an expression that looked like she was glaring at us, but her eyes were dead.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Most likely Sensei was right.</p><br/><p>It should be normal for slaves or assassin to have some form of tools on them. But\u2026 Even so, I wondered why Sensei was extremely shocked when he saw the [Collar of Slavery]. I looked at Sensei and he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201d Slavery was banned decades ago. The manufacturing method of [Collar of Slavery] was ceased and it was said to be a taboo magic item. \u201d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>No wonder he was surprised.</p><br/><p>I stared fixedly at the collar, observing it. Sensei said that only the one who put it on could take it off, which meant some kind of magic might be imbued into it. So, there was a possibility that Onee-san was working against her will.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sensei\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I whispered into Sensei\u2019s ear and tentatively had his approval. Even if I held Onee-san\u2019s collar, she did not move one bit so there was no worries there.</p><br/><p>I quietly went near to Onee-san and murmured.</p><br/><p>I was really just grasping at straws here.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300a\u300b\u201d [TN: Kaihou, Release]</p><br/><p>The thin black metal broke and fell with a clank.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Jin [Oi Jean, what are you doing\u2026hm?]</p><br/><p>Jean [Hmmpphhmmmp.]</p><br/><p>Jin [\u2026.We got pulled one over by John]</p><br/><p>Jean [Mmmmhhpphmm.]</p><br/><p>Jin [\u2026Even so, he sure did it flashy, didn\u2019t he.

The glittering water.</p><br/><p>And, that dazzling dark blue swimsuit that reflected in my eyes\u2026.no, no, no, I\u2019m kidding! I did not see it! I saw nothing! So stop throwing stones at me!</p><br/><p>The ones who were wearing the school swimsuits around me were all my classmates from the First Years White Team. It was all my classmates. I am not a lolicon. I had no reason to be looking at kids, 10 years old kids.</p><br/><p>Yes, these eyes were eyes as if a mother was looking upon her own children! It was pure! Very pure! I was just admiring them for how cute they looked.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Stop the tsukkomi about how you were right that I was looking. Because you lose the moment you tsukkomi.</p><br/><p>No, not that Selphy, who was sitting right in the middle of my view, had blinding white long legs was making me stared at them hard! I was only admiring at how great youth was! That\u2019s all!</p><br/><p>\u2026..Let\u2019s stop.</p><br/><p>As the tsundere comments rolled around in my mind, they came to a stop when I spotted Zen. The only thing left was a bittersweet and slightly empty feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yo. You are quite late, Zen. \u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing me, Selphy, who was dangling her legs in front of me, looked back. At the same time, her left leg was left hanging in mid-air and that scene just went and struck me in the face, causing me to let out a noise. And that, made everyone turned and looked at me. I smiled, trying to gloss it over as I returned my attention to the both of them.</p><br/><p>\u201d Why are you even later than me? \u201d</p><br/><p>She said, lightly glaring at Zen as she twisted around to look at him. Zen took a step back at her response but then, as if he recalled something, a smile floated up onto his face.</p><br/><p>\u201d No no, the reason was\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>He stopped speaking. Or rather, he was stopped. Why?</p><br/><p>\u201d Uwahhhhhhhhhhhh!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Someone standing at the edge of the pool had fallen in, causing a splash. The droplets of water falling glittered in the sun, making me stare in wonder of the beauty Summer can give.</p><br/><p>\u201d Did you not say you will never say it?!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Snapping my head back, a flushing red Mi was standing there. His tightly clenched fists were trembling slightly. He was really frantic. Without thinking, Selphy and I looked at each other before breaking into grins. He he he he he, so that\u2019s how it was.</p><br/><p>I tried my best to resist the urge to grin. Mi stood there, looking as if he was considering to confess or not. Grabbing hold of the edge, I lifted myself out of the pool before standing behind Mi in an instant. At the same time, Selphy stood up and placed a hand on Mi\u2019s shoulder, glancing at him.</p><br/><p>\u201d What happened, Mi? \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, the corners of Selphy\u2019s mouth rose, as she glanced at Mi, grinning widely. Ah, I think my expression was most likely the same as hers. Looking between the 2 of us, a noise got stuck in his throat as his face paled.</p><br/><p>Zen, at this moment, was waving his limbs about. And he was somehow saying something weird like \u201d Glub glub glop glop \u201d \u2026..Heck, he was drowning! Panicking, I dived into the pool. Catch and release.</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah, no, that was slightly wrong.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Standing at the stage erected next to the pool was the Headmaster. And then, mana started accumulating at his throat. Without the Headmaster even saying anything, everyone quietened down. Why? Because everyone was anticipating his arrival, and so, all eyes were on him. Taking a deep breath, the Headmaster\u2019s voice reverberated throughout the area.</p><br/><p>\u201d AND NOW, THE PHYLLIS ACADEMY SWIMMING TOURNAMENT WILL COMMENCE! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>A loud bang sounded the moment Headmaster finished speaking.</p><br/><p>Yes. And thus, it had started. The Swimming Tournament.</p><br/><p>Although there wasn\u2019t much time between saving Zen and preparing, our team managed to safely stand at the starting point.</p><br/><p>Ah, thank God.</p><br/><p>Because if I can\u2019t bring myself to have the widely anticipated swimming tournament suspended because of our team. I am really thankful for how unperturbed this other world was.</p><br/><p>If this was \u2018highly aware of the issue\u2019 Japan, if a kid was to drown before the start of the tournament, this entire event would be suspended due to the \u2018teachers\u2019 negligence.</p><br/><p>But anyway, I was acting as the \u2018guardian\u2019 of the group. Although I had always known that Zen can\u2019t swim, I still gave in to curiosity and focused on Mi instead.</p><br/><p>I have to reflect on that.</p><br/><p>Looking around, I saw everyone up with burning with a fighting aura. The ones near us were mostly consisted of First years, but looking towards end of the pool, I could see the senpais there.</p><br/><p>They were only 1-2 years older, but just that and I could see a difference in body build. Especially their muscles. If this was purely a test of strength, we would be completely defeated. But too bad, this was another world. The main point was that magic existed here. Even I cannot imagine what kind of tournament this would be.</p><br/><p>Well then, well then.</p><br/><p>I took my time observing the pool, as I would not be able to once the tournament started. Letting out a breath, I focused on everyone in front of me.</p><br/><p>Firstly, Selphy. I saw her standing behind the diving board. And if I was to squint, I would see the tiny figures of Zen and Mi standing at the opposite side of the pool. Yea, they were full of cheating spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201d Selphy! \u201d</p><br/><p>I raised my voice as I yelled. It did not attract any attention as it was slightly covered by the surrounding chattering.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes? \u201d</p><br/><p>But Selphy heard it. She tilted her head as she turned around to look at me. And on that face, no trace of nervousness could be seen.</p><br/><p>Yosh, if that was the case, everything was going to be alright.</p><br/><p>I grinned, and gave her a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>Try your best!</p><br/><p>Was what I was trying to convey and Selphy nodded, grinning as she turned back to face the front.</p><br/><p>Every team seemed to be doing the same thing. Looking satisfyingly around, the Headmaster had a smile on his face. Then, he lifted his hand up in a snap.</p><br/><p>\u201d A-nd, START! \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, water magic were shot straight up in the sky, as the tournament started.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: I just wanna say sorry\u2026. there was supposed to be a post yesterday but I went to Universal Studios Japan instead\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Really, leaving the next 2 chapters for next week would be better as they are connected, 1st and 2nd part\u2026. really!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

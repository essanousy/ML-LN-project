My wish had finally came true!</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 Yes, I finally got to helped out with Father\u2019s work. I had always wanted to rescue Father, who was always buried under layers of paperwork and I was finally allowed to assist! Yay me! Go me! Let\u2019s go for more and more!</p><br/><p>As party poppers were setting off inside my heart, I was working hard at writing up all the reports. These reports were all reviews that were to be send to different villages.</p><br/><p>For example, giving advice to questions like \u2018This and this happened so what would be the best course of action?\u2019.</p><br/><p>Yes, I was living each day to the fullest.</p><br/><p>I would have you know what I had given up on a lot of things just to reached this stage! Yes! Like my will and pride! Eh? I don\u2019t have any pride from the beginning? Idiot! Imagined a middle-aged man like me looking up to another person while going \u201d I want to be of help\u2026 can I? \u201d and tilting his head!</p><br/><p>A man always had a sense of pride that he would carry to his grave, was what Grandpa had taught me. That\u2019s a man! So why was I playing cute over here?!</p><br/><p>But, there was a huge wall, my age, blocking my way forward so this was the only choice I had. Besides, my only aim was to be able to help my father in his work. So I had said something I would never said usually due to my highly easily embarrassed nature.</p><br/><p>I love my parents, who gave me immense love that I was unable to get in my previous life. So even if it\u2019s just a little, I want to fulfill my duty of filial piety towards them. And to achieved that aim using any methods could be counted as a man too, right?</p><br/><p>Yep.</p><br/><p>It, it\u2019s not like Father stifled his laughter until his shoulders was trembling after I did that. And definitely not that even Mary-san had the same reaction.</p><br/><p>\u2026.. That was unexpectedly unbearable.</p><br/><p>It was easier to bear if they had just laugh right out. Like how it would be better to admitted that you fell instead of pretending that you were tying your shoelaces. Trust me, it was loads better.</p><br/><p>My neck made cracking noises as I lifted my head. The long hours of staying in the same position had stiffen it. I had this since my previous life. This pain was only those who get stiff shoulders easily would understand. But to think I would had it when my age now was only in a single digit\u2026</p><br/><p>Lossening my shoulders, I gathered the documents I looked over as I stood up. Father was sitting right opposite of me. Ah, the towers of papers were gone, by the way. The first thing I did when I started was to clean everything up. I had stored the overflowing papers into another pocket space magical tool that I newly created. This tool could only be opened by those whose mana had been registered. Of course, the only ones registered were Father, me and a few officers working under Father.</p><br/><p>\u201d Gion-Sama. \u201d</p><br/><p>A crease appeared between Father\u2019s brows when I called him.</p><br/><p>\u201d Just call me father. I gladly welcome papa too! \u201d</p><br/><p>I called that title because I thought there was a need to separated work from private life. I smiled when I heard Father\u2019s objection.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Father. These documents doesn\u2019t seems to be about the territory. \u201d</p><br/><p>Father stood up and walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sorry, these are for the knights. \u201d</p><br/><p>Father said as he stick his tongue out. I want to draw back in disgust but I suppressed that impulse and shown no reaction. It would be my loss if I did. My experience told me that it was useless otherwise with Father.</p><br/><p>But dear Father. He looked reliable but he was unexpectedly careless. Eh? Like father like son? Ah, but I don\u2019t know much about my grandfather\u2026\u2026 Not that, it\u2019s me?</p><br/><p>\u2026 I know that!</p><br/><p>\u201d Suspicious personal had been spotted in Sociunnov\u2019s territory\u2026 Father, this is\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>But, in these situation, Father\u2019s very much reliable. When I touched upon that subject, Father\u2019s expression turned serious.</p><br/><p>\u201d The Anti-Kingdom fraction is hiding themselves recently. Or is it better to say that the trend had died down\u2026 And Manny from the Sociunnov\u2019s territory has been asking if it was alright to request for the increase in people to deal with all the suspicious people appearing recently. \u201d</p><br/><p>Father\u2019s explanation confirmed my suspicions. Father was the leader of the knights as well as the lord of Beryl\u2019s territory. His position don\u2019t allowed him to moved or to released any information he knew easily. Although he easily revealed it to me. This showed a flexibility in thinking and a great intellect. Too bad about his average face.</p><br/><p>The lord had asked the King directly for permission. Which meant..</p><br/><p>\u201d He is cleared of suspicion of belonging to the Anti-Kingdom fraction so the King\u2019s response would be\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d He approved. The Sociunnov\u2019s territory is the wall of defense against North side of the [Demon Forest]. It\u2019s position is incredibly important in regards to the national defense. We are to temporary dispatch some help from our side. \u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded like something was about to happened. And, the King had wanted us to dispatched all the support we had. Which meant the Black Knights. Of course, support against the \u2018suspicious personal\u2019 could only meant one thing.</p><br/><p>\u201d Father, my stomach hurts so can I take some rest? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 The Black Knights were none other that the Intelligence corp. And if the country\u2019s battle troops had been deployed, it meant that it was the same for our opponent.</p><br/><p>In simpler words, those suspicious personal was people send out by the Hattuo Empire.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

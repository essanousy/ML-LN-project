Sorry, the internet was not working yesterday and I gave up tinkling with it. Enjoy!</p><br/><p>Magic tools.</p><br/><p>Throughout history, it was known as the miracle that could make impossible into possible. After engraving the detailed magic circle onto it and setting a mana stone, you could blow life into it. It was a dream -like existence, as long as you keep the mana stones going, one could even overcome the wall of being bound by your attribute.</p><br/><p>Well then, let\u2019s ignored that last paragraph, which advertised the excellence of magic tools, you noticed the word \u2018magic\u2019 in front. Of course, that meant that normal tools apart from \u2018magic tools\u2019 exist too.</p><br/><p>If only magic tools exist in this world, then they would simply be called \u2018tools\u2019 instead.</p><br/><p>Well, let me apply the example of the tools we had on earth. Those that obey the laws of physics. Cars that ran on gas were called normally as cars but when the new breed which uses electric instead, appeared, they were branded as \u2018Electric Cars\u2019. If cars were being called as \u2018cars that follow the laws of physic\u2019, you could think if there were any other kind. Like what? Telekinesis cars? \u2026.Which was why that kind of naming would cause confusion.</p><br/><p>In the first place, just about 200 years ago, magic was deemed to be something only doable by Nobles. For the commoners, they would hardly be able to live without any sorts of tools. Of course, those that can be used without magic.</p><br/><p>Presently, most of the commoners in Hattuo spend much of their lives without even encountering magic. To them, the only tools they know were of the non-magical kinds.</p><br/><p>Dylan Magical Tool Shop</p><br/><p>It was a building made out of stone, and had a thick-set wooden door. If not without the signboard stating it\u2019s name, you wouldn\u2019t even noticed it was a shop. For it looked just like any other house.</p><br/><p>In the first place, it was not situated in a place for business. In other words, this was a residential area. If they really wanted to do business, they would had never chose this kind of place.</p><br/><p>By the looks of how their goods were arranged haphazardly, it just gave of a feeling of not wanting to do business. Anyway, the only person working was the owner, who was deep inside the shop, working on his craftsmanship. That might be the reason why he do not felt like serving customers.</p><br/><p>And this Dylan Magical Tool Shop was at the west of Elzmu, just next to the Iiza River, at a street governed by Sociunnov house. It was as though fate was playing a trick, as the next head would be Mi but\u2026.</p><br/><p>The owner, who was working silently, raised his head up.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..I wonder what\u2019s happening with Zen\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, this magic tool shop was Zen\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026no-san\u2026 Bruno-san! \u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard a voice, the owner snapped his head up. It was already evening.</p><br/><p>He then stood up redundantly, for it was a voice he was familiar with. Brushing aside the pieces of metal piling up all around him, he finally made his way to the counter.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, so it\u2019s Ruby. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d What oh! How many times do you think I called you?! At least be slightly embarrassed about it! \u201d</p><br/><p>Raising her slanted eyes at him, was dark-skinned white-fluffy ears cat beastman. It was a girl at the peak of her youth around 20.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I am very sorry. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Why did you say that as though you\u2019re reading lines?! And badly to-! \u201d</p><br/><p>She said that as her tail and ears stood up straight, her entire body trembling as she retorted before biting her own tongue. She stood there quietly, embarrassed, her entire face red. And, without minding Rudy, Bruno opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201d And, what\u2019s up? \u201d</p><br/><p>Ruby looked at him, amazed.</p><br/><p>\u201d You really did forget about it\u2026. I give up! Although I have lots to say to you, if I did the day is really going to end\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>She said but it was just an excuse in case she bit her tongue or stumbled over her words again.</p><br/><p>\u201d Today\u2019s the collection date for the goods, which is why I\u2019m here! Really! No matter how I called, you just won\u2019t come out! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Ha ha ha, really? Ah sorry sorry, I forgot. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ruby clenched her fist, trying to endured how Bruno said that without a shred of remorse.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s nyan you should should be nyanarrassed about it!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>And, as expected, she still stumbled over it.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>When I returned to my room, Zen was still sitting at his table with a gloomy face. It looked quite bad as not even one book was opened on his desk.</p><br/><p>He did not seem to noticed me, who entered the room quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201d What should I do\u2026. Will Father be okay\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the ceiling with an unreadable face.</p><br/><p>His father, was it? Hmm. According to Calius-senpai, Zen seem to be worrying over not being able to catch up with his studies\u2026 Could it be that there was some troubles with his family which was why he wanted to skipped grades so he could returned home soon?</p><br/><p>\u2026.I can\u2019t see it from his usual attitude but he was bearing some pretty heavy stuff, wasn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>When it come to this situation, I had no idea what to do. You might be asking what am I talking about as a 25 year old but really, I had never met this kind of situation before. Saying that, I felt slightly depressed.</p><br/><p>Ha ha ha, that\u2019s because I had always been alone\u2026. Zen was my first friend since coming into this world too. What was this? Why was I becoming sadder?</p><br/><p>I did had someone I could call a friend when I went into High school but that guy was someone who don\u2019t worry over things. Ah, that might be just an excuse.</p><br/><p>No matter, until now, Zen did not tell me anything. I don\u2019t want to think that I was not being rely on\u2026 but it was the truth. He do trust and rely on me to a certain extend but in this case, even if he did tell me, I doubt I could do anything and it might not be a something that can be told to others.</p><br/><p>Then, what should I do?</p><br/><p>Stuck in my thoughts, I stood there in a daze in front of the door, a behavior very unbecoming of my age.</p><br/><p>And it was when I was troubled over how I should raise this topic up with Zen.</p><br/><p>Guuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah. Welcome home, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..! \u201d</p><br/><p>Taking his disappointing owner\u2019s place, his stomach growled loudly.</p><br/><p>Of course, I went red.</p><br/><p>Suppressing my embarrassment as much as I could, I lifted my head up and looked at Zen. My growling stomach had given me a great chance. I can\u2019t let this chance slipped away. I will never lose to my embarrassment!</p><br/><p>Clenching my fists, I opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm, Zen? Are you okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wha\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You said something about your father just now\u2026. Sorry, I overheard. \u201d</p><br/><p>I explained to the confused Zen. As it sounded like I as eavesdropping, I apologized just in case.</p><br/><p>At my answer, Zen laughed awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, it\u2019s nothing big though? \u201d</p><br/><p>And so, Zen began talking.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Erm, so the main point is that Zen\u2019s father is bad in everything else other than making magic tools? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Un. I\u2019m really worried how long the shop can last. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen sighed, as his shoulders slumped. In the end, the only thing I could do was to pat him on the back.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: I\u2019ve kept you waiting! My test was finished today so I wrote this up in a breath! Come quick\u2026summer holiday!</p><br/><p>And so, this is Zen\u2019s troubles chapter.</p><br/><p>Zen\u2019s troubles isn\u2019t anything big. Sorry for making you anticipate about it. Ah, no one is anticipating it?</p><br/><p>Ha ha, sure there is.</p><br/><p>Zen [\u2026I have started to worry about the way the author treated me.]</p><br/><p>Will [Give up, it\u2019s futile.]</p><br/><p>Zen [\u2026\u2026\u2026]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

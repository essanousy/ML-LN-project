I did not know if it was because of my willingness to study came through to him but Sensei nodded, satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201d And so, to begin with, the necessity for any form of learning, let us start with learning how to read and write. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, there is no need to. \u201d</p><br/><p>I learned how to read and write a long time ago.</p><br/><p>Since I answered straight away, John Sensei was surprised for an instance.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s of course! Do not look down on the specs of a child\u2019s brain!</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026I see. Then let us start with mathematics, addition and subtraction. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I probably could do that too. \u201d</p><br/><p>This time I was directed a stunned expression.</p><br/><p>I was not trying to be smart\u2026ah, it was true that usually one would learn all those at 3 years old so he must definitely think that I was bluffing.</p><br/><p>\u201d I can really do it. \u201d</p><br/><p>Looking down on me, a gentle smile appeared on John Sensei\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Ahhhh\u2026please don\u2019t look at me with those tepid eyes!</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, please solve these for me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Pulling himself together, John Sensei took a few pieces of paper from inside a bulky book and passed it to me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, Sensei. \u201d</p><br/><p>Taking a pen out of my breast pocket, I looked at the paper that was handed to me and saw math questions lined up.</p><br/><p>There are a few that were graphics questions, just like a school test.</p><br/><p>Since I said I could do it meant that I had to solve this easily right? What was this punishment?</p><br/><p>I glanced at John Sensei and our eyes met. It was difficult to do this with someone watching\u2026</p><br/><p>I prepared myself and began to solve the questions silently.</p><br/><p>Since the questions were prepared for kids, I, who had prepared for high school examinations, could solve it easily\u2026. But man, if this was kid\u2019s level, this world\u2019s studies level was so high\u2026</p><br/><p>Since everything looked mid-european-ish, I had underestimated you.</p><br/><p>After 20 minutes and with all the correct answers, I handed the paper back to John Sensei.</p><br/><p>With wide eyes and a pensive look, John Sensei asked.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.You are done? \u201d</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, calculations in this world might not be the same as my previous world\u2026and I felt a tinge of uneasiness. The possibility that I did not think of made me started panicking.</p><br/><p>What if all he saw was nonsensical calculations written on the paper\u2026.? Nervous, I looked at Sensei, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026You have..done it. \u2026Well done, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>After checking for a period of time, John Sensei looked up with a smile. However, his face showed a moment of worry.</p><br/><p>\u2026I wondered what\u2019s wrong?</p><br/><p>\u201d But\u2026What am I going to do? I thought I would be teaching reading and writing and now, I do not have enough materials to continue. \u201d</p><br/><p>He murmured and I finally got it. So he was worried about that. If that\u2019s the case, we would do that!</p><br/><p>I then smiled at Sensei.</p><br/><p>\u201d In that case, I want to know more about John Sensei! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Woah, I finished this in record time! As fast as I did Digest 004 \u2013 The Thoughts of The Boy. If you haven\u2019t read that yet, please do.</p><br/><p>PS: I am quite sick and tired of explaining to all the shota and yoai comments. Yes, until I have solid prove that \u2018Hey, the author is writing a yaoi fic!\u2019, I\u2019m gonna delete all comments pertaining to that.</p><br/><p>Yes, John is not a Shota nor is this Yaoi (for now).</p><br/>\n</div>"}

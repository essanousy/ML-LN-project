For the time being, he was as expected, a polite and level-headed person.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>But I was troubled.</p><br/><p>Even if this was my wish, I could not seem to find any word to start a conversation. Besides, I found myself much more nervous than I thought I would be that I froze.</p><br/><p>It should be me, the elder, to break the ice. And even if I had thought of various things, my mind went blank ever since I came in.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Erm\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>William-sama said, timidly.</p><br/><p>What a disgrace, showing such a (frozen) face. Perhaps, I might be seen as glaring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I am sorry. \u201d</p><br/><p>Embarrassed, I coughed.</p><br/><p>This time, I made sure to focus on William-sama before I opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Relax, relax.</p><br/><p>\u201d I unknowingly got nervous. As you know, I am John Veltor, and I will be working as your tutor from today onward. \u201d</p><br/><p>Trying to avoid a scary impression, I carefully paid attention to my words as I introduced myself. And then, William-sama returned with a graceful greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, I will be in your care. I am Williams Beryl, please call me Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>At the birthday debut, I did think about the possibility that he had memorized that speech. I still found it difficult to believe that a 3 years old kid could talk like that.</p><br/><p>But, once I came here, I was convinced.</p><br/><p>Yes, it was William-sama who prepared that speech. It was too shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm, what should I call Veltor-sama? \u201d</p><br/><p>As I was called out, my attention snapped back.</p><br/><p>This was getting interesting, I could not help but give in to my mischievous side.</p><br/><p>\u201d You can call me however you prefer. Only\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Well then, how would this young genius react to this? As I was thinking about that, I instinctively smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201d ..not Veltor please. \u201d</p><br/><p>I had thrown my family name away.</p><br/><p>Since I, who was born into the problematic Veltor house, was to undertake the position of an educator role, I wanted to, at least relay this to Williams-sama and of course, Gion-sama.</p><br/><p>And above all, how he would react upon understanding my words. I did feel sorry for testing him but most of all, I was amused.</p><br/><p>William-sama immediately gave a smile and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then, John-sensei! Would that be all right? \u201d</p><br/><p>The reply, that was more than what I expected, was slightly jaw-dropping.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026..I could only say that he was indeed a genius.</p><br/><p>It was a reply that he understood that I was uninterested in power, house name or currying favor just by my words alone.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes please, I look forward to working with you. \u201d</p><br/><p>With no relations to with my family, he narrowed the relation down to a personal level by simply using my name and attaching \u2018Sensei\u2019 to it. Wonderful. It was wonderful how he exceeded my expectations.</p><br/><p>To be able to teach this person, I was glad I left my house. I might be a fortunate person.</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, I began talking, being in a good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201d By the way, Will-sama. \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Will showed a displeased face.</p><br/><p>\u201d John-sensei, please stop with the \u2018Sama\u2019. \u201d</p><br/><p>What a humble attitude.</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, although Beryl and Veltor family sounded alike, they could not even be compared against.</p><br/><p>Veltor being a Viscount house, Beryl being a Duke house.</p><br/><p>In addition, the name of Veltor house was at the bottom. In comparison, Beryl house, in addition to Gion-sama\u2019s activities and his good ruling with, had the reputation of being the best in the country. They were also a family that had a long standing history. Really, towards that person\u2026.I only had admiration.</p><br/><p>In the end, the relationship with me was not of noble standing but instead, a pure student and teacher one.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then\u2026 Will-san \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Will alone is fine. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Eh\u2026That is a bit\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s okay because you are my Sensei! \u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought.</p><br/><p>It was difficult to suppress my instinct to smile. Even if I tried to resist, he had insisted to call him Will with a compelling attitude. This made it very clear that we were a teacher and student.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah yes Sensei, what is the matter? \u201d</p><br/><p>Will said, as he remembered that I wanted to say something.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah. It\u2019s just..If you don\u2019t mind me asking, it is a little early for a 3 years old kid to have a tutor. I was wondering if you made this request or was it Sir Gion\u2019s idea? \u201d</p><br/><p>Really, how did Gion-sama educate? I really could not imagine.</p><br/><p>But, Will smiled bitterly and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, it was me who requested. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, really, today, no matter how many hearts I had, they would not be enough.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s Will\u2019s\u2026? But why? I don\u2019t mean to be rude but boys at your age usually only think about having fun. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I don\u2019t know anything. I am proud seeing Father so needed (busy) but as for me, I can\u2019t help with anything\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I remembered that I was shocked by the mischievous tone Will had used.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026And I am frustrated with that. \u201d</p><br/><p>Really\u2026..This person.</p><br/><p>Was a genius to the extent that you would be amazed.</p><br/><p>And I wondered if this was fate. I kept feeling that it was.</p><br/><p>\u201d So that is why.. \u201d</p><br/><p>I had become the tutor of this person.</p><br/><p>With the ability I had, I wondered if it would be enough.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, let\u2019s study hard as soon as possible, shall we, Will? \u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

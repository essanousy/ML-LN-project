Since Abi\u2019s incident was tentatively over after talking with Zirco-san, he must have come to talk about the compensation for the broken crystal ball and the destroyed classroom.</p><br/><p>Ahh\u2026.. My secret savings were going to decrease.</p><br/><p>But I should have some leftover so it should still be alright. As I had wanted to eat some familiar food, known as \u2018B-grade gourmet food\u2019 in Japan, I had Buhual-san gathered some spices for me and made some sauce and stuff. And thanks to that, I earned some pocket money.</p><br/><p>Or rather, as it was super popular, I earned enough to even buy the entire land around my house.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Hehe.</p><br/><p>Anyway, I believed I should had no problem with money.</p><br/><p>Ah, speaking about money\u2026 Caralsdoni-san. According to Maria, he does not sound like a bad person but magic exists in this world. As long as the possibility of him being controlled by the slave collar existed, it was better to be careful.</p><br/><p>Although it didn\u2019t feel good to be doubting a friend\u2019s parent, it was not confirmed that Caralsdoni was the culprit. He might be in a similar situation as Chiffon. Or rather, that possibility was higher.</p><br/><p>As a merchant basing his trade around this country, why would he go looking for trouble with King or Beryl\u2019s family? As I heard, he had a favorite phase [Energetic as long as there is money in this world]. As that kind of person and a merchant, it was difficult to think that he would do anything that could result in a loss for him.</p><br/><p>King, as well as Beryl family had lowered their taxes as well as the toll to enter the gate in order to improve the economy. In anyone\u2019s eyes, even with the incident 3 years ago, it would be better for the merchants to choose King\u2019s side than the corrupted Nobles. Even without that reason, as someone who single-handedly brought up his company, he should be able to do simple calculations about which side would give him profit.</p><br/><p>Despite him being wanted, I do not think that he was the mastermind. Ah, I did share all of these with Zirco and he seemed to be putting that in consideration as well. Anyway, I left all Caralsdoni-related stuff to the leader of Intelligence Corps, Zirco.</p><br/><p>As my job was supposed to be over, I did not think that it was the reason I was called\u2026</p><br/><p>Hmm.</p><br/><p>Who called me anyway? Headmaster, please give me an explanation.</p><br/><p>Thoughts ran through my mind as I approached the school gates and got a shock.</p><br/><p>\u201d How troublesomeeeeee!!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>A bear was raging outside the gates.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026..What\u2019s the matter, Buhual-san? \u201d</p><br/><p>Hahhh, a sigh leaked out. It looked like he did not visit in peace. \u2026.Once the summer holidays are here, I\u2019ll stroke Chiffon to my heart\u2019s desire!</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d And? What happened? \u201d</p><br/><p>I confronted the still-excited bear after capturing him. As the Academy does not allow outsiders, I lead him out to eatery in the streets. In cases like this, being in the capital sure was handy. There were an abundance of shops lined up here.</p><br/><p>Calming Buhual-san down, I made sure no one was around us before taking a seat. We were not specially attracting attention but just in case. Letting out a bit of mana, I cast it chantlessly.</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b[TN: Sha On, sound block]</p><br/><p>Looking at Buhual-san\u2019s panicking reaction, it might be better not to be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will-sama\u2019s magic is as warm as ever. \u201d</p><br/><p>Buhual-san murmured, his eyes closing slightly.</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>Warm?</p><br/><p>I knew that mana had no temperature but Selphy said the same thing before. Might be something about the warmth of the aftermath of the magic maybe? I guess? The first time I used magic was when I was 1. Maybe that\u2019s why it felt kinda warm and full of life.</p><br/><p>Oh, I digress. Anyway, it seemed like Buhual-san had calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201d What did you do? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I blocked the sound from going out. It might be better this way. \u201d</p><br/><p>As he stared at me in amazement as if saying I had not changed, I used my gaze to urge him to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh yes!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Bear-san cried, looking like he just realized something. What was he standing up all of a sudden?! Taking the opportunity while I was taken aback, he grabbed my wrist and pulled me out of the shop.</p><br/><p>Oi\u2026.wait\u2026..the bill!</p><br/><p>Twisting myself while being hugged underneath Bear-san arm, I stretched my hand forward.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, no need for change\u2026ugh! \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying the phrase that I-had-always-wanted-to-say number 10, I threw the coins towards the counter. Although I was feeling sorry towards the waiter, who was blinking his eyes in surprise, I was in confusion as well. Or rather, I would like you to praise me for this instantaneous decision.</p><br/><p>Yep. As the son of Beryl family, I can\u2019t be said to leave without paying. A strange moan came out. Let\u2019s do that again. For the sake of me, let\u2019s make this a secret.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wait\u2026.ha\u2026.Bu\u2026.u-san\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: A refresher, Will had gave Buhual a nickname in chapter 34 \u2013 The Future but it was never revealed. It is now, from the obvious pooh, he called him Buu. ]</p><br/><p>The shaking.</p><br/><p>Every time the tall Buu-san moved, the difference in stature caused my body to sway/shake wildly. The jolt that ran through my entire body caused me to moan.</p><br/><p>As expected, tall people have long legs. This Bear-san, for a bear he sure had long legs. Urgh. No worries, I still have the future.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.That\u2019s not it!!</p><br/><p>Why did this person carry me and start running through the capital all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>But as expected of a former shadow, there was no sound coming from his running. Oi! Someone explain please.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>I gave up. Because Buu-san was really sprinting through the streets. There was no choice, I can only leave it to Buu-san. Struggling will only cause me to injure myself.</p><br/><p>As I stared at him, my mind drifting away, he suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sor, sorry. Will-sama!! Caralsdoni was captured!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Lowering me down onto the stone-paved road, the severe shaking had my vision swimming with stars but Buu-san seemed to be overlooking that as he desperately looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026huh? \u201d</p><br/><p>I did hear him.</p><br/><p>It was just that why had Caralsdoni, who had the intelligence officers searching high and low for him, was brought back by him?</p><br/><p>No no no no no, it was not that I wanted an explanation. What do you mean by picking him up from the river? Was Caralsdoni Momotaro?!</p><br/><p>As my vision slowly stabilized, it began to sink in. In short, he wanted my help in saving the innocent Caralsdoni who was captured after picking him up from Dyuvu.</p><br/><p>Hm.</p><br/><p>\u201d Let\u2019s just go to the checkpoint first for now. \u201d</p><br/><p>Truthfully speaking, I am only 8 years old. Yes, I was involved in the incident but why would Buu-san come to me for help? He shouldn\u2019t have known I was involved.</p><br/><p>Glancing at Bear-san, I sigh softly.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d My Maria\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, tears flowed down his cheek and through his thickly grown beard.</p><br/><p>Caralsdoni was stricken with despair. He should be. An almost naked person being thrown in a foreign country would be confused and cried normally. Such tough spirit would not even withstand against such sharp attacks.</p><br/><p>Having finally reached the capital and thinking of meeting his lovely Maria, he was captured at the checkpoint as a person-of-interest. At this moment, he was hold in an empty room made of stone. Most likely, he would be facing a harsh interrogation according to the rumors. Just thinking about it gave him the shakes.</p><br/><p>Really, what did he do?</p><br/><p>Having been captured despite not remembering anything was another unknown fear. But if he was to go to prison, money can\u2019t be used there and he could never meet with his beloved daughter.</p><br/><p>It was hopeless.</p><br/><p>Total despair.</p><br/><p>It was like someone holding a knife and forcing him to the edge of the cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201d It can\u2019t be\u2026..!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Caralsdoni cried, jerking up. He regained consciousness in Dyuvu but maybe he did something during the period where his memories went hazy when he entered the capital.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s not good\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>The isolated Caralsdoni went pale. And when he curled himself into a ball, a man that looked like the Knight-in-charge of the holding cell walked in.</p><br/><p>It was as though he pitied the completely pale Caralsdoni, the Knight gently got him up and brought him out of the cell and into another room.</p><br/><p>Ahh, what was going to happen to him?</p><br/><p>Should he hate god or should he pray to him? His feelings right now were a mess. As opposed to the dull and heavy atmosphere in the cell, Caralsdoni was surprised by the bright and cheery atmosphere in the room. He was totally thinking that the interrogation or the torture was about to begin.</p><br/><p>In fact, he was sure of it.</p><br/><p>And in the room, sitting on the sofa, were a slim man and an angel-like boy.</p><br/><p>\u201d Are you Caralsdoni-sama? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.Uh eh?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Th-The angel spoke!?</p><br/><p>Caralsdoni jumped up without thinking. He had no idea what was going on. Being caught as a person-of-interest, was he not going to be interrogated? Was the angel being the one interrogating him?</p><br/><p>Caralsdoni stole a glance at the angel, who had a beautiful smile on his face. Was he going to whip him while maintaining that smile of his\u2026?</p><br/><p>As his imagination ran wild, his pale face turned completely white. How dreadful. As he stood fearing the 2 in front of him, the angel spoke suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Zirco-san, what did you do to Caralsdoni-sama? He is completely fearful of us with such a pale face. \u201d</p><br/><p>No, he was the one Caralsdoni was afraid of\u2026.was what he would never say even if his mouth was split open because it seemed like the opponent was not out to scare him in the first place.</p><br/><p>Which means he was never meant to torture Caralsdoni. Everything was okay once Caralsdoni realized that. Because he was a man who recovered fast.</p><br/><p>The slim man then urged him to take a seat with an apologetic face and in relief, Caralsdoni sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201d And so, Caralsdoni-sama. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ye-yes. \u201d</p><br/><p>His shaking voice was just a sign of courtesy. Caralsdoni looked straight at the angel, preparing himself for the oncoming questions.</p><br/><p>\u201d Would you mind answering truthfully? \u2026..Have you met with your daughter after she enrolled into the Academy? \u201d</p><br/><p>All strength left his body. He was prepared to be asked if he had committed any crimes but to think questions about his daughter?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Could it be, something happened to her?!</p><br/><p>\u201d N-no! I haven\u2019t met her! Is-is she okay?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Forgetting his fear, Caralsdoni stood up and leaned forward, shouting. As if trying to calm him down, the angel smiled gently and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Don\u2019t worry, nothing happened to her. She is having fun everyday. \u201d</p><br/><p>Relieved at his words, Caralsdoni sank onto his chair as if his knees gave way.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..that\u2019s great. \u201d</p><br/><p>His tears started flowing again.</p><br/><p>And at his words, the angel\u2026.Will exchanged glances with Zirco.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Eh, what happened to the watermelon smashing? The result of that was not important. The important thing was to have fun. To put it simply, I failed at smashing it. Yep.</p><br/><p>Selphy, for some reason, managed to smashed it calmly at her first try. And that was even before we even started instructing her.</p><br/><p>I wondered if this was a special ability of Elves. And when I thought about it, I knew it couldn\u2019t be. Because that Selphy did followed instructions. Yes, I think you should had guess it by now. That\u2019s right, she was following the Faeries\u2019 instructions.</p><br/><p>How crafty.</p><br/><p>But she did not broke any rules in a sense\u2026.. This was where I deeply felt the fantasy side of this world.</p><br/><p>Oh yes, the smashed watermelon was delicious.</p><br/><p>\u201d Fireworks as in that fireworks? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen asked, tilting his head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep. That fireworks. An art piece that is made out of explosions. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Huh? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen turned his puzzled gaze at me. Oh well.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Nothing. Don\u2019t worry about it. Anyway, fireworks. \u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Selphy, who had been wearing a proud expression, asked.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2019s fireworks? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Nice question, Selphy! I have been waiting for someone to ask! \u201d</p><br/><p>A smile floated up onto my face.</p><br/><p>In this world, the only fireworks were those that were being fired into the sky. Originally, on earth, fireworks origin from China where they had something like dynamites and Europe used it to shoot up into the sky as a way to proclaimed power. As it was an object used to show off power in times of war, it had to be huge and flashy.</p><br/><p>That was why, speaking of fireworks, the first thing that came to mind was those that was to be shot into the sky.</p><br/><p>But shooting of a rocket firework when friends gathered at your garden would be disastrous. Well, what about at the riverside then, you asked. No, that was out too. Because you would be found out immediately. Then how about some deserted area like rice paddies\u2026. Well, all I can say was that if you own those rice paddies, sure, fire away. If not, it would be a different crime altogether.</p><br/><p>Policemen are scary.</p><br/><p>Cough cough.</p><br/><p>Well, what about fireworks in this world?</p><br/><p>\u201d Fireworks is something the First Founder invented. A ball packed full of explosives will then be thrown into the sky and when it explodes, you can enjoy the visual and the music of it. The reason is because of the easily burnable gunpowder and metal powder and different types of metal powder would produce different colors. Which means, making these wonderful fireworks are not limited onlynto high mana possessing Nobles but to everyone! \u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Terao invented it. He sure did a lot of stuff. But I get it cause he had always liked reincarnation-type of stories. It was also the reason why, a well-liked ikemen like Terao could became good friends with me, the leader of loneliness. The 2 of us would often chatted about stupid topics like [If we were to travel to another world].</p><br/><p>But I wondered how he would felt, to had his descendants build a bronze statue of him and to even included him in the textbooks, singing of his praises. If it was me, that was definitely going to be a part of my [black history]. Ha ha ha ha ha.</p><br/><p>I was pretty sure he was going to feel the same. But the reality was that he was the one that invented it. I wondered what for though. To hyped something up?</p><br/><p>Terao in heaven must be blushing really hard right now. I respected you, you know, Terao. A grin can\u2019t stop hugging my lips though.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sorry, I don\u2019t understand. \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy\u2019s sentence pulled me back into reality.</p><br/><p>\u201d It means a light show as beautiful as flowers would spread over the sky. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>To think it would be Zen\u2019s explanation that caused Selphy\u2019s eyes to sparkled. I, I am not a guy who would be disappointed at that. I clenched my fists as I forced my face to looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Plus! That\u2019s not all! Look at this! We also have these 2 sparklers that can be delivered right to your doorsteps at only 500 yen! \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, mimicking a certain popular shopping channel sales pitch as my higher-then-usual voice traveled throughout the garden.</p><br/><p>\u201d 500 yen\u2026..? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d What are you talking about, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be! I was being looked down upon?! Even Selphy!</p><br/><p>\u2026.Okay, I\u2019m sorry.</p><br/><p>I should had know that jokes from my previous world would not be understood and would only made me looked like a deranged person. And I also came to realized that my excitement level at having friends over was through the roof.</p><br/><p>Oi, you. Don\u2019t looked at me with that face! It\u2019s really not like I was lonely or anything! I\u2019m bluffing, I was lonely.</p><br/><p>Stay calm.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, I tried to calm myself down. The inner me was already a splendid adult. I had to calm down and showed off my my adult-ness.</p><br/><p>\u201d Leave me.. I am just excited\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, it spilled out without me knowing. No, Zen did not placed a hand on my shoulder as he smiled gently. Selphy too, was not grinning at me either. Nope, they were not.</p><br/><p>\u201d But it\u2019s still bright now, wasn\u2019t it? \u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if he was trying to console me or something but with his hand still on my shoulder, Zen changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201d It will be dark in an hour. \u201d</p><br/><p>I answered as I escaped from Zen\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then what do we do with this 1 hour? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Well, since we are going to do it, wouldn\u2019t it be better if it\u2019s an original by us? \u201d</p><br/><p>I replied Selphy with a huge grin on my face. A special privileged just for us.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

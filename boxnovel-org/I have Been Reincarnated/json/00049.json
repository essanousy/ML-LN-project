Did you already know that phenomenon? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d No\u2026.. I predicted that that might be the case. \u201d</p><br/><p>I could feel an amazing aura from the Headmaster so I thought that rather than lying badly, I might as well reply honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201d I see. \u201d</p><br/><p>Sipping on his tea, Headmaster continued explaining, already knowing that my mana amount was not normal.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, the magic to break would be invoked the moment it is aware of that fact. \u201d</p><br/><p>Even so\u2026 I replied with another question.</p><br/><p>\u201d Does Zelda-sensei not know about that phenomenon? \u201d</p><br/><p>Headmaster looked at me for a second before returning his gaze to his tea, laughing heartily.</p><br/><p>\u201d The crystal measurement tool placed in the Primary Academy had a limit of 300. The average mana a regular adult holds is around 100~150. However it is not rare to find double or even triple that amount. That is why it is normal for freshman to possess half, or even less than that amount. Zelda must not have thought you are that abnormal. \u201d</p><br/><p>Headmaster, who was laughing rather inappropriately at that, had eyes that sparkled. In that case why would the Headmaster come to that conclusion so easily? Can it be due to his experience?</p><br/><p>\u201d But thanks to this happening previously, I came to know about it. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d It happened previously\u2026\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s right, there was a student, who, like you, broke the crystal ball because of over-capacity. \u201d</p><br/><p>Headmaster placed his cup of tea down with a clatter.</p><br/><p>\u201d Gion Beryl. Your father. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 Of course.</p><br/><p>As expected of Father.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I really had to thank Father. Thanks to him being the precedent, this whole incident was able to be solved smoothly. In the end, my mana was to be measured with a crystal ball of a higher limit on the day after.</p><br/><p>It seems like the Elf race possesses high mana. That was already expected but they were being called as Fairy race in this world. There were various theories about that, in that their mana was high or that they used to be able to converse with faeries.</p><br/><p>Anyway, in regards of those students, the Phyllis Academy had set another day, with a higher limit crystal ball, for the mana examination. And I would be measured along with everyone else on that day.</p><br/><p>Today was set only for body examinations so our classes ended in the morning. It had ended before I even knew it when I was chatting with the Headmaster.</p><br/><p>Which is why, instead of my classroom, I am currently returning to my dorm instead. Or rather, I got lost. This school was way too big\u2026.. Because of that, after much effort, when I finally found my way to the White Wind Dorm, it had already reached late afternoon.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am back\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I opened the door, Zen came flying over.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will! Are you okay? I was worried because you were so late! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm? Ah, ah, sorry. \u201d</p><br/><p>I answered, being pressed by Zen. I am unable to say that I am late due to being lost in school\u2026 Then, surprisingly, Zen started grinning.</p><br/><p>\u201d Just kidding~ \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..!</p><br/><p>What?!</p><br/><p>Looking at the weirdly grinning Zen, I instinctively took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wha..What, what\u2019s the matter! \u201d</p><br/><p>At that, Zen stopped grinning that weird grin of his and started smiling normally.</p><br/><p>\u201d My house\u2026is a factory for magic tools. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d R..Really? \u201d</p><br/><p>Which means\u2026 I looked at Zen and found his eyes sparkling.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep. Just by that you understand, which means it was really \u2018Over-Capacity\u2019? \u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded at the smiling Zen. There wasn\u2019t even a moment to worry about telling him or not before it was exposed. I felt so stupid, worrying if Zen would distance himself away from me when he knew that, seeing that he continued to smile normally, while being immensely curious. Relieved, my laugh was mixed in with a bit of sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201d Kinda. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Ah, you are really amazing! That model was built for 300, to think 300 at 8 years old! \u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered aloud if it was because I am a noble before that excuse was blown away by Zen.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, that has nothing to do with being a noble or not. \u201d</p><br/><p>Or rather, I had the reincarnation [Cheat].</p><br/><p>Ah, my inner brain retorting sessions revived.</p><br/><p>\u201d Anyway, this is a secret, okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>Our eyes met and we grinned. Having a secret together was kind of fun.</p><br/><p>\u201d To think, magic tool factory\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>More than anything, I was really glad. I thought I would be treated as a monster for having mana over 300 but Zen was treating me the same. Normally people would have the reaction of fearing, or in awe, or even starting to flatter but Zen was doing none of it. Ah, but the moment I met Zen, he was already not normal. Thinking back to the sentence he said when we first bumped into each other made me laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201d I wanted to help out with the factory as soon as I can, that\u2019s why I am aiming to skip grades. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I had the same reasons as you. \u201d</p><br/><p>I replied, and Zen turned his face towards me, surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2019s with the face? \u201d</p><br/><p>I laughed, frowning jokingly at him. I would have to explain myself clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201d The reason why I skipped grades to attend this school at 8 was because I wanted to help out with Father\u2019s work. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen stared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wha\u2026What? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Nothing, but really, Will is weird. \u201d</p><br/><p>He sprouted such rude words happily. Damn it. What are you talking about. Return the emotional moment I felt before! Why did I even think he would change? By the strength of my internal age, I managed to not hang my head in depression and walked over to my table. But, it was true my behavior was being pulled along by my body\u2019s age. But no matter! This adult me will not be damaged any further! Yep!</p><br/><p>Squatting down, I took out the thing I stored at the bottom right corner.</p><br/><p>Zen is my roommate for at least 2 years. And even in the best of times, I am rather bad at lying and within that 2 years I have no idea when I would be found out. Since this was such a good opportunity, let\u2019s go all out and show my hand. If I managed to gain a partner, then if anything happens, Zen could most probably help out.</p><br/><p>I stood up, and at that perfect timing, Zen spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201d Come to think of it, Will knew about magic tools? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep. Or rather, I made one. \u201d</p><br/><p>I show Zen the thing in my hand proudly.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026..Eh? \u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that Zen had frozen over with his eyes wide opened. I hoped he would not comment about the design. It being a half-moon pocket was too weird to be brought out for usage, so I made it into a pendant. Like those which you could opened and store a picture inside.</p><br/><p>[TN: An an an, totemo daisuki, Doraemoru~]</p><br/><p>\u2026After considering for so long, the best thing I could come up with was a pendant? Ku\u2026. Alright! It\u2019s fine for you to laugh at my taste! At any rate I don\u2019t seem to have any taste at all. But to come out with something a boy could wear without being out of place, it was all I could think of.</p><br/><p>Eh? Asking me to attach that pocket to my belly and take a stroll? Stop screwing around, I will punch you!</p><br/><p>By the way, I had not tried smithing yet. No, it was not that I do not yearn to do it. Rather, I want to.</p><br/><p>As I am talking to myself, Zen took my pendant in his hands and was curiously observing it.</p><br/><p>\u201d How do you find it? \u201d</p><br/><p>Even if I asked that, an open-type pendant was not something that could be found easily, even in my previous world. So I (naturally, by magic) added a hinge randomly on the elliptical shaped pendant. What I want to say was, it works better than it looks so please do not stare at it so much. It\u2019s embarrassing.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.You made this, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen looked at me with doubt in his eyes and I smiled wryly. Normally, any changes done on metal would be by smithing. To think, an 8 years old smithing. Everyone doubts that.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>I had decided to reveal everything which was why I brought this tool out.</p><br/><p>\u201d Give it to me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Taking my pendant back, I opened the clasp. Thrusting my thumb and index finger into the pendant, I retrieved a thick book out. Zen\u2019s eyes grew wide.</p><br/><p>Yes, this kind of magic tool. As you can guess, the -th Dim\u2013sion -ket! I passed the retrieved book over to Zen, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201d Zen, do you know magic? \u201d</p><br/><p>I think there was no need to explain what book it was.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u300eMagic That Even Monkeys Understand Elementary\u300f.</p><br/><p>This is my treasure you know. I am so sorry for saying you are annoying, Mr Author. I had used this book intensively.</p><br/><p>\u201d To put it bluntly, I can use all-attributes. \u201d</p><br/><p>I said it casually. To tell the truth, I was as nervous as giving a confession to my first love. To a party younger than me, this is pitiful. But without thinking, my expression turned serious. Zen, no longer smiling, looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d You\u2026. are not lying? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d No. \u201d</p><br/><p>I then looked at the space above us and Zen followed by line of sight. Then, to make it easy to understand, I chanted.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300a\u300b\u300a\u300b\u300a\u300b\u300a\u300b\u300a\u300b\u300a\u300b\u201d [TN: Here we go. Hi (fire), Sui (Water), Kaze / Fu(Wind), Do (Earth), Hikari (Light), Yami (Darkness)]</p><br/><p>Pon pon pon. Following the cute sounds, balls of different attributes floated up. Zen stared, shocked. I then placed my hands on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh? What is it, all of a sudden! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Sorry! I had to apologize first! \u201d</p><br/><p>Having said too many things at one go, Zen cannot seem to catch up. I am so sorry for confusing you. But if I leave these things till later, I would definitely regret it. That was why I needed to explain it clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201d My house is rather high up (in the ranking). Which is why I often get targeted. Before this I even got kidnapped before. Which is why there might be situations where Zen would be involved. I should have told you this before we moved in so, sorry! Really sorry! \u201d [TN: Since when did you get kidnapped, Will?]</p><br/><p>I raised my lowered head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Which is why I want you to understand what my abilities are. Which is why, if it is not too serious, I would be fine. There also might be situations where Zen might need to use your magic. I would like you to understand this. \u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than my mana being 300 and above, this was more urgent. It sounded ominous but there was no choice\u2026. and I was about to give up on the frozen Zen.</p><br/><p>\u201d A\u2026.mazing\u2026! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen came back!</p><br/><p>He came back with sparkling eyes. His eyes looked just like John-sensei when we first met.</p><br/><p>\u201d How did you do that! That magic! I wanna do it too! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen, who was bouncing about excitedly, did not even notice my smile.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Now you know why Will hides it. He\u2019s his father \u2018trap\u2019, remember. I do like it that he does tell people though.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

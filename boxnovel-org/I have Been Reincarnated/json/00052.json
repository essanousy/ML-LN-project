Thank you!</p><br/><p>Please continue to support me from now on.</p><br/><p>This chapter will start from Will\u2019s father POV.</p><br/><p>TN: Oh yes, Krebert, thanks for that lengthy advice. I am trying to follow it\u2026 trying.</p><br/><p>3 years had passed from that incident.</p><br/><p>That incident \u2013 The one where the Anti-Kingdom faction had kidnapped Will. My blood ran cold that time. But, once I got back to the house, Will had already settled everything using his magic. Moreover in an absurd and reckless way.</p><br/><p>My son was really out of the norm.</p><br/><p>Transference, Heal, Gravity.</p><br/><p>[TN: Remember, the people of this world used transfer instead of teleport]</p><br/><p>And he was able to use at least Light and Wind attributes. By his attitude, he may be able to use more than that. No matter what, those were all magic to be feared. And when I asked where he learnt it all, all I got was \u201d I knew those from the start. \u201c.</p><br/><p>I had heard of something like that once before \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 That magic was actually a language.</p><br/><p>The famous tale of the \u2018Abandoned Child\u2019 spoke of it. The \u2018Abandoned Child\u2019 possesses an incredible amount of mana but that was just a front. The truth was that he was a person who can manipulate the magic \u2018language\u2019.</p><br/><p>As it was an old tale, there was no way to prove it. But, what I could do was to at least protect Will.</p><br/><p>Power, is always poisonous.</p><br/><p>Handling it in the correct way will turn it a medicine but the wrong way will turn it into a deadly poison.</p><br/><p>It was a deadly poison for Will. If he ever indulges in it, he will lose himself. Plus he is my son, a Duke\u2019s son. Right now he has both the power and the status.</p><br/><p>Moreover, that much power will be feared and avoided by people. I was worried, but now, it had become needless.</p><br/><p>Even though Will is still young, I had a feeling he knew what he was doing. He was never proud nor went about flaunting his status and power. His actions told me that he knew how scary power can be. In the first place, he did not even tell us about the fact that he could use magic.</p><br/><p>[TN: That was because he wanted to wow you. I see that he succeeded.]</p><br/><p>The uneasiness and anxiety I felt might be because I was lonely but at the same time, I can\u2019t help but be proud of my son, Will. I wonder if this was what all parents feel.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, apart from my job, I am also seriously training Will, similar to how novice knights train. I started the training as a joke but soon after, we grew serious about it.</p><br/><p>Will grew, absorbing everything just like a sponge. The training also became a time I looked forward to everyday. Even if I was surprised at how fast he was learning, in the end it was because it is Will. I cannot even hide my smile now. As Will, with his training sword, was serious about learning, I too, had a plan for him. Frankly, thinking about him being a swordsman alongside me, I might be jealous at his skill then.</p><br/><p>This 8 years old son of mine might just be able to defeat a fledgling knight right now.</p><br/><p>And that was what we had been doing for the past 3 years.</p><br/><p>As for other activities\u2026</p><br/><p>It was when Chiffon, ex-Shadow, had already been with us for 2 weeks.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>The young ex-Shadow, was attached with the [Collar of Slavery].</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015[Collar of Slavery], it was a taboo magic tool that controlled slaves against their will and had long since been banned. The manufacturing method was said to be lost but looking at this case, it still existed.</p><br/><p>This was much more serious than expected. Imagine someone using lost methods to create banned items and to add on to it, that person was an enemy of ours.</p><br/><p>Being the leader of the Knights was only a cover for me who is part of the King\u2019s personal corps. The main aim of this special corps was to get all the revolters by any means necessary.</p><br/><p>It was easy to think of all the terrible scenarios that could happened with them using [Collar of Slavery].</p><br/><p>The one who took off the collar attached to the young ex-Shadow was none other than Will. As I thought, Will is really out of the norm. But he is super cute so it\u2019s okay. The tiny figure of his when he was giving his all trying to think of a name for her had me giving him full marks for cuteness!</p><br/><p>And Chiffon became the young ex-Shadow\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>I took the chance to question Chiffon when Will was asleep. She was living in an orphanage before being sold to the [Shadows]. And from there, the collar of slavery was attached and she was forced to work as a Shadow. She had also killed many in her time as a Shadow.</p><br/><p>But to the trembling girl, I wondered if my feelings got across to her. No matter what I said, she would most probably think it as humoring her. But rather than devoting my time making her understand, it was more urgent to expose who the mastermind was. Luckily, Lily and John were here. Instead of a tongue-tied person like me, they would stand more chance in getting her to open her heart.</p><br/><p>Veltor was being named as the mastermind but many things do not fit. I am most certain there is another pulling the strings. If I continue taking my time for this, I might get deceived by the appearance and evidences that might appear. Dealing with the aftermath, I left the house the next day.</p><br/><p>In the fastest speed I can manage, I rush all the way to the orphanage in Kaina Chiffon mentioned. West of my territory, it was at a mountainous place, upper steam of Iisa River that was the border separating Elzmu and Hattuo country. Iisa River flows from the Demon Forest and all the way around the metropolis. Without taking even a day, I reached Kaina.</p><br/><p>The orphanage Chiffon spoke of was in the outskirts of Kaina and when I reached the place, there was not even a trace of it left due to a fire accident.</p><br/><p>The enemy moved faster than I thought. After that, no matter how hard I investigated, nothing came up. I can\u2019t help but curse. I had belittled them. This is tougher than I thought.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>And with that, 3 years passed.</p><br/><p>No matter how I questioned Veltor, who was in jail, I still cannot even grasp their shadow. According to Jean, he had spoken to a [black hooded man] to hire the Shadows. As for the mastermind Jin, he admitted that there was a partner. A black hooded, mask wearing, voice-changed (using a magic tool) partner that he could not even figure out if he\u2019s a she or she\u2019s a he. Good grief. Why did he even rope in someone whose identity he did not even know? His stupidity amazed me to no end.</p><br/><p>But this shadow puppet master had laid low completely for these 3 years. There must be a way to rouse them\u2026..but what?</p><br/><p>And because of that, we spend these 3 years worrying endlessly.</p><br/><p>Going along with my lies, Will set traps all over my office. If anyone even entered my office without permission, they will be transferred to space where magic can\u2019t be used.</p><br/><p>How can I say it\u2026. It was so amazing that I can\u2019t stop gasping. As expected of Lily\u2019s and my son!</p><br/><p>And the other day, this bright son of mine had entered into the Academy, skipping grades. Feeling lonely, I had rubbed my cheek with his rather splendidly but got beaten up by Will.</p><br/><p>Hahahahahaha. I would not receive any damages from punches from an 8 years old kid, Will! Look at you blushing, so cute!</p><br/><p>With redden cheeks, he suddenly and rudely entered the horse carriage. But in the end, he still waved good-bye to me even though he wanted to rebel against me. Fufufufufufu, no use hiding your feelings from me Will.</p><br/><p>Will would be staying in a dormitory in the Academy. As the danger level was going to be higher than him staying at home, I was uneasy. But Will who usually never wanted anything for himself, had said that he wanted to attend Phillis Academy, which was John and my alma mater.</p><br/><p>And when I asked him the reason, he answered with \u201d I wanted to graduate High Academy as soon as possible as so to help Father with your work. \u201c. There was no way I can say no after hearing that!</p><br/><p>Ku\u2026.those upturned eyes! How can I deny anything that cute face that resembles Lily asked for! Ah, this was impossible for me.</p><br/><p>Ah well, since it is Will, there shouldn\u2019t be any worries.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Back to 3 year ago, 2 men somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201d W-What?! Failure?! \u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time as the Fat guy exclaimed, a sound of glass shattering could be heard. In front of him, a black hooded man was kneeling.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, the 3 shadows sent by Veltor was caught, Sir. \u201d</p><br/><p>A red stain was spreading on the carpet. It looked like the glass that had shattered was a wine glass. Contrary to the agitated man, the black hooded man was reporting in a calm and emotionless voice.</p><br/><p>The ugly and fat man clicked his tongue and crashed down on his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201d Damn that Veltor\u2026. To think I had thought he could be of use\u2026. how useless. \u201d</p><br/><p>After he got tired of ranting, he looked at the black hooded man in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201d And? How were the shadows caught? It was reported that Gion had been lured out to the capital. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes. According to the information, Gion\u2019s office was rigged with traps. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Traps you say\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>The fat man raises his brows and grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201d Something smells funny. \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Take care and do a background check on Williams Beryl. I don\u2019t mind how long you take. Make sure it is thorough. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: WOW. Cliffhanger. At the start I wasn\u2019t expecting much as it wasn\u2019t a chapter of Will in school but it turned out to be really exciting. Enjoy~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

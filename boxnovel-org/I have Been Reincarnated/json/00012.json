This is to her!</p><br/><p>Editor : Poor_Hero and Lazaruz22</p><br/><p>\u201d Gkyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Such was the pain that I almost fainted.</p><br/><p>My first time giving birth.</p><br/><p>With the others encouraging me, I finally managed to push the baby out through the birth canal after great pains but I had also reached my limit.</p><br/><p>My vision went slightly hazy.</p><br/><p>Then, a robust baby\u2019s first cry reached my ears and snapped me out of it. \u2026.Ah, I wondered if the baby would turn out to be as naughty as that person. As I thought about it, the corners of my mouth went up.</p><br/><p>Mary, the Head Maid, gently carried my child over to his first bath and washed him carefully. That wrinkled face\u2026was so cute.</p><br/><p>It must be my imagination acting up because my baby looked like he enjoyed and was feeling very comfortable in that bath.</p><br/><p>\u201d What a healthy boy. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mary delightfully said, as she looked at my son. She then carried that tiny him from the bath and brought him over to my side.</p><br/><p>\u201d Look, it\u2019s your mother~ \u201d</p><br/><p>Mary looked so happy, like he was her own son.</p><br/><p>I stared fixedly at my son and tears started welling up. \u2026.It must be my imagination at work again because he looked like he was making a strange (puzzled) face.</p><br/><p>His face was really wrinkled\u2026but so so cute.</p><br/><p>Oh my\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201d Are you laughing I wonder. Will, my adorable son. That is your name, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>The first child that was blessed to me and that person. [TN: I wonder why she refused to say Gion\u2019s name.]</p><br/><p>Such happiness. Such overflowing love.</p><br/><p>I called his name over and over, trying to let him know, even just a little, about my feelings.</p><br/><p>And then, Will, with a face full of happiness, started dozing off. This time, it was definitely not my imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201d Nice to meet you, my cute precious Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN : I wanted to be better at writing dialog\u2026</p><br/><p>TN : Once again, thanks everyone for you help in trying to make this chapter happen!

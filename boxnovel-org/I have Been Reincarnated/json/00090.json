This world was yet polluted, from the fresh air and the clear sky which the stars glittered brightly. The feeling of travelling after crossing the Iza river, as well as the drop in temperature might play a part in me feeling this way as well.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Why? \u201d</p><br/><p>The inns looked suspicious. And in spite of this being a city / town for the country\u2019s border, there were hardly any inns around. And when evening came, none of the existing inns had any space.</p><br/><p>So we ended up setting up camp.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Why? \u201d</p><br/><p>Sharp-sighted Shiro noticed me slumping my shoulders and muttering to myself.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm? What\u2019s that, Master? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Even though it\u2019s my first trip overseas\u2026. Even though it is going to be my first time staying at an inn\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Something was definitely messing with me. Like how I got an address-unknown-jobless Onii-san as a reward for me crushing an illegal slave merchant, or how I was camping in the streets despite being my first overseas trip.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s because you have a disaster constitution. \u201d</p><br/><p>As I was raking my brains for an answer, Shiro dropped a bomb on me. The sudden attack made me jumped around in surprise.</p><br/><p>So..so that\u2019s how it was\u2026</p><br/><p>I, who had an average face and was not popular like those main-characters.</p><br/><p>Ah, but I had a feeling these days, the Light Bell\u2026 I was so shaken that my language ability took a hit\u2026 Light Novel, or LN for short, featured ordinary MC. Ordinary yet surrounded by high-leveled oddballs and caused trouble for them.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Ha ha ha.. \u201d</p><br/><p>I see, so that was it.</p><br/><p>My god. This was nothing to laugh at. There was no way I can laugh at this.</p><br/><p>I mean, disaster constitution, disaster constitution\u2026.</p><br/><p>Oi oi, really, what did the First Founder teach this Sacred Beast(Shiro)? Why was he taught all these ridiculous nouns and verbs?!</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t. It\u2019s exhausting to talk to him every time.</p><br/><p>And when this exchange was taking place..</p><br/><p>\u201d Gwah.. \u201d</p><br/><p>A groan sounded somewhere down from where we were. By reflex, the both of us turned towards the origin of the noise. The man made a noise like he wanted to get up.</p><br/><p>Shiro moved towards the man who was stirring by rolling a little on the ground. Please don\u2019t scold him for rolling. There was no space in the horse carriage available for an injured man to sleep, Watson. No place.</p><br/><p>No no no, I did not hear anything like it\u2019s cold outside.</p><br/><p>\u201d Are you, awake? \u201d</p><br/><p>I squatted beside Onii-san and looked at him. He groaned.</p><br/><p>\u201d ..Ah..er\u2026Where\u2019s\u2026here? \u201d</p><br/><p>He frowned in agony as he pushed himself up.</p><br/><p>\u201d We\u2019re outdoors~ \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, directing an innocent smile at him. Having to act innocently after a while was quite painful.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026eh. \u201d</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t stare at me like that, my mouth was cramping.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Onii-san? \u201d</p><br/><p>After continuously calling him, he turned towards me suddenly. He must still be half-asleep just now. He then started to look around, turning his face left and right. Slapping his own cheeks with his hands, he nodded to himself, finally calmed.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Willia-chan, do you know why are we outside? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I will be explaining that instead. \u201d</p><br/><p>When I was about casually giving some answer in a child-like way, Zirco-san came out of the carriage at the perfect time. As ever, his Jill Stuart-mode was perfect. Be it the speed he can change his clothes, be it his acting, be it his appearance, if it was Earth, he could become the best illusionist there.</p><br/><p>Surprised, Onii-san turned towards Zirco-san and nodded frantically. Well, to see the sky dark when you woke up, was rather surprising. Anyone would want to know what happened. Sorry, currently, I was an innocent-child character. Though I did want to explain it to you as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201d Firstly, here is a little away from the north gate\u2019s streets. \u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded self-importantly at Zirco-san\u2019s words. As there were no available inns, we went out of the streets as we had decided to camp. We were planning to head towards the center of Hattuo so it did not matter which direction we headed out, so we randomly chose a place to camp.</p><br/><p>By the way, the checkpoint was at the south gate.</p><br/><p>\u201d So it\u2019s Foir Centeru Street\u2026right? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes. After catching the illegal slave merchants, we wanted to look for other inns. But they turned us down as they didn\u2019t allow Beastmen and before we knew it, it was evening and every place had been filled. So we ended up setting up camp instead. It doesn\u2019t matter as we are aiming to go to the center of Hattuo anyway. \u201d</p><br/><p>How rare it was to see the ever-smiling Zirco-san. How rare it was to see Zirco-san talk for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201d Why was I\u2026..? \u201d</p><br/><p>The obvious question. Why was he even carried along? Because we had discussed and decided to carry him along. Zirco-san smiled, a fatherly, gentle yet slightly troubled smile that makes people feel like destroying it.</p><br/><p>Damn it, stick that smile up your nose!</p><br/><p>\u201d You quit your job as a soldier right? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026yea. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d About that, your captain was in cahoots with the slave dealer, which was why he stopped you. It is partly my fault for you losing your job and I cannot just leave you alone at the street as it is dangerous, so I take you along without asking. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.The captain is? Damn it, I finally get his attitude. Rather, how did you guys know? \u201d</p><br/><p>Looking regretful while spewing abusive language, Onii-san asked, as expected, the reason.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I just politely ask him to talk. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was assaulted by Zirco-san\u2019s smile. His eyes were not smiling. Somehow, he felt like someone I knew\u2026</p><br/><p>Onii-san gulped.</p><br/><p>I get it! Zirco-san referenced his friend(John-sensei) for his character! I finally got that weird deja vu feeling off my chest. That was why that smile had such power behind it.</p><br/><p>Onii-san turned slightly pale. I get you, my friend, I get you. Ignoring the pale Onii-san, Zirco-san continued.</p><br/><p>\u201d And so, what are you planning to do from now? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wh, what, you say\u2026 Finding another job, I guess. I don\u2019t have any freakin\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t have any money anyway. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Since you quit the military, I supposed you can\u2019t continue to stay in Flowason. Do you have a destination in mind? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026. Ah,no\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Onii-san only seemed to realize that after being told by Zirco-san.</p><br/><p>\u201d In that case. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco-san paused, before continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201d There is something I would like to discuss with you. If you don\u2019t mind, I would like to hire you. It is my fault that you ended up like this and I do have connections. If you prefer to enter into other occupation, I can introduce you. \u201d</p><br/><p>After digesting what Zirco-san said, the stunned Onii-san stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Do you mean you want me to be Willia-chan\u2019s guard?! Wahh\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah ah.</p><br/><p>He stood up in rush but instantly fell flat back onto the ground. He seemed to have forgotten the pain he felt earlier. His muscle ached. That was the payment for forcing mana, which he hardly used, into his muscle to get them to move beyond their capacity.</p><br/><p>\u201d Argh\u2026oww\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the sprawled Onii-san, Zirco-san and I looked at each other and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Masterzzz, it seems like there is a soldier near Williamzz. \u201d</p><br/><p>The huge demon, sitting on the sofa, twisted its body, holding a big bee-like demon beast. A bee that was almost like a hornet, its weapon jutting from its butt looked even more atrocious. Although it was dancing around the demon\u2019s hand obediently but raging around was most likely its default state.</p><br/><p>It would attack anything that moved. To add on, the poison from its sting was lethal. Anyone who saw the hornet-like creature would frantically force down their screams as they slowly backed up.</p><br/><p>\u201d What? \u2026.How convenient. So Hornet could speak. \u201d</p><br/><p>In contrast, Spinel was moving towards the sofa agitatedly. As a matter of course. Hornet, and even the Demon were his summoned beasts. He shouldn\u2019t be afraid of his own summoned beasts. But Spinel\u2019s face was paler than usual. Even so, his self-mocking smile was still playing on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201d What are you saying, my beast. There is no way you can\u2019t understand each other. \u201d</p><br/><p>Demon answered as he stroked the hornet.</p><br/><p>\u201d That is true. Where are they now? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d The road near Foir Centeru Streetzz. \u201d</p><br/><p>After getting that information, they turned and faced Spinel, who smirked wryly as he started walking.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then. Let us invite them to our house, shall we? \u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing inside, Spinel\u2019s job was ending soon. It won\u2019t be perfect, but it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to get it done. He was going to give it his all.</p><br/><p>As he felt his body being eaten up little by little from the inside, he looked out the window. The stars were glittering and sparkling brightly. But now, Spinel could feel a closeness to a falling \u2018star\u2019 instead.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

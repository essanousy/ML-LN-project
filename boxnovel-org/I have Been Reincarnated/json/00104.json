Are you okay\u30fc?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard a desperate voice calling from above, I put aside my bewilderment and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I\u2019m okay! I\u2019m alright! It looks like I had fallen into a very dark place. \u201d</p><br/><p>Well, I was caught surprised and lost to gravity but I did have a thing called Magic.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, I\u2019m going to te- \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.eleport\u2026 Was what I was about to say when a weird noise sounded up ahead. And when I was about to venture into the darkness to investigate by reflex, Zirco-san\u2019s rare shouting voice reached my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am coming to rescue you now! \u201d</p><br/><p>After which, a heavy scrapping sound was heard on top and, surprise surprise, a fairy (Zirco-san) that was wrapped in wind descended.</p><br/><p>Master! You came from the sky\u2026..Hm. Nothing. Let\u2019s give it up.</p><br/><p>I was so surprised that I almost sprouted a certain person\u2019s lines.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Why did you come down, Zirco-san?!</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh dear, I came down on impulse. \u201d</p><br/><p>Said the Ninja-san with a beautiful emotionless face. At least say that with a wry smile or something!</p><br/><p>It will destroy your reputation of an Intelligence Corp to not even know what traps your house has! Was what I wanted to say but\u2026..</p><br/><p>He gave off a straight-laced Ninja feel when we first met but this person was actually quite out there. I could finally understood John-sensei\u2019s questionable face when he said, before our journey, Zirco-san most probably had common sense. To begin with, I should know that this person was not normal since he was John-sensei\u2019s friend. It was best not to get involved with him.</p><br/><p>He was, in some ways, very ninja-like.</p><br/><p>For the sake of my master\u30fc! He would do all sorts of things while saying that. His loyalty was first-class. I would definitely accomplish my mission! Something like that? Yep.</p><br/><p>\u201d I don\u2019t care anymore\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>You would have to forgive me for this attitude. I just can\u2019t help it.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026..I came because I was interested in the traps this mansion had as well. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh! Is that true! \u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to be impressed. With an emotionless face as usual. It was like I was being recognized for my usefulness. I was not unwilling in helping the owner to uncover the mysteries of his house.</p><br/><p>Mah, I would be lying if I said I was not excited.</p><br/><p>I then cast a light magic, which illuminated the darkness, showing a cave-like tunnel.</p><br/><p>The secret passage underneath the revolving door in a Ninja mansion\u2026!</p><br/><p>This just added on to my excitement! It was like a maze! Was I going to explore a dungeon?!</p><br/><p>I would not be called a Japanese if my excitement was not this high.</p><br/><p>[TN: I am pretty sure you aren\u2019t right now\u2026]</p><br/><p>And so, let\u2019s us continue on! Let\u2019s go!</p><br/><p>The dimly lit tunnel, by magic, continued on. Sometimes, the moaning of the wind made me jumped. Even so, this sight made me really excited.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.Hm? \u201d</p><br/><p>What will awaited me at the end of this tunnel? It was when I continued walking. Something was making a noise ahead of the unlit part of the tunnel. And when I used magic to search, I felt something moving.</p><br/><p>\u226a\u226b</p><br/><p>[TN: Anshi, Night vision]</p><br/><p>When I secretly chantlessly cast it, I could see a human figure. His height was about 150~160cm I think. Hm? I should have used this in the first place? You totally don\u2019t understand, do you? There will be no excitement in that! What for did you think I broke my curfew to explore this?!</p><br/><p>For the adventure!</p><br/><p>Since I specially came to another world. Anyone would yearn after this kind of adventure. Plus, a ninja mansion coupled with a secret tunnel, it was like a dream come true! Was there any other way than to explore it?</p><br/><p>Seeing Zirco-san stopped his feet, he noticed it too.</p><br/><p>Looking at each other, we nodded, before stealthy walking. Ninja stealthy walking\u2026. how authentic. My excitement was high to the point that pointless stuff was running through my brain. I shall ignore the voice that said I was always thinking of useless stuff like that.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, a stone-paved ceiling could be seen up ahead. Eh, could it be, this was buried a building? Uoooohhhhhhhh! Awesome!!</p><br/><p>With my excitement at max levels, I activated my magic chantlessly.</p><br/><p>\u226a\u226b\uff01</p><br/><p>[TN: Genzai Ichi Kensaku, Search current location]</p><br/><p>A map appeared in my brain with the name of the building on top was shown.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.The academy? \u201d</p><br/><p>I mumbled, stunned, as the person on the other side came into the light.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Eh..? \u201d</p><br/><p>To think it was the school that laid ahead. Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, you found it, Zirco-san. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You\u2015\u2015! What are you doing here?! And don\u2019t call me Zirco-san! Didn\u2019t you always call me Father?! \u201d [TN: Chi chi ue, direct translation would be oh great father.]</p><br/><p>\u201d What, you say, just remodeling? \u2026Ah, but it\u2019s embarrassing. To talk like that now is quite embarrassing, isn\u2019t it? Zirco-san (\u2026\u2026), it really shows a lack of common sense to talk like this in this period of time. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d This way of speaking is the correct way as passed down through our lineage. Besides\u2015\u2015 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026it was bestowed by the First Founder? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That tone of yours! Not only that! This speech is fitting for both a ninja and the leader of the Intelligence Corp! It is a kind of speech which carried power and might! And you! What are you doing, speaking in that foolish way and complaining, you are the one with the lack of common sense for even making a trap in the guest room! \u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong for my jaw dropping open. I mean, the tunnel that was under the trap floor was linked with the school. not only that, Calius-senpai was standing at the end of it, and the default emotionless Zirco-san was red in the face, engaging in a shouting match with him. Anyone would had their jaw hanging open.</p><br/><p>\u201d But that kind of speech is lost as time goes by, isn\u2019t it? Is there any meaning in using it then? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.Kkuu. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Plus, you know, who do you think the one who was taking care of the house when Father was not around? Even Mother said it. To say all this despite the fact you are always not at home. \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Calius is using the normal way of saying father, Oto-san]</p><br/><p>\u201d Kkuuu! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco-san\u2019s character was collapsing.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm\u2026.. sorry for breaking in the middle\u2026 ? \u201d</p><br/><p>Chaos was spreading with Zirco-san hugging his head as he mumbled while Calius-senpai was watching happily. And as I spoke up timidly, the both of them looked at me. I was suddenly pierce with the glance of 4 eyeballs.</p><br/><p>Uuuhhh\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>So alike. Weren\u2019t they super alike, these 2?</p><br/><p>Why did I not notice it earlier?</p><br/><p>The me who was surprised by Calius-senpai\u2019s background\u2026.it\u2019s useless. It was to the extent where even his own parent didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>From the emotionless pair, a question mark could be seen pointed at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026 erm\u2026\u2026 Calius-senpai\u2026.. this here is? \u201d</p><br/><p>Somehow, I lost my ability to make a normal sentence. I can\u2019t help it. Anyone would lose it when they were being stared at by those emotionless eyes. 2 pairs of them.</p><br/><p>Calius-senpai looked proud at my question.</p><br/><p>\u201d A secret passageway. Just when I was taking a stroll under the floor, I found this tunnel which led back to our guest room. Convenient isn\u2019t it, to be able to come back to the academy any time? \u201d</p><br/><p>Oi, wait a minute. Convenient? Sure, but why the hell did this tunnel even exist in the first place?! Or rather, what did you mean by talking a stroll underneath the floor?! Was it somewhere you can casually take a stroll to?! Under the floor??!!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..There was too many things to retort to.</p><br/><p>Urgh, I cannot lose here.</p><br/><p>The conversation couldn\u2019t continue. I was betting my curfew on this. I should swallow all of my retorts and maintain my pace.</p><br/><p>I somehow put on poker-face, before returning my gaze to Calius-senpai.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..It sure is. I\u2019m envious. And, Zirco-san over there. \u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded like I was reading lines but it can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019m not the wrong one here. Zirco-san, who was crouching down, lifted his head at my call. He had a miserable face on.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2019s the lost speech of the Ninja family\u2019s? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco-san opened his mouth somewhat timidly.</p><br/><p>\u201d The Ninja family was bestowed a way of speaking from the First Founder. But the 2nd generation rejected it, causing it to be lost\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Calius-senpai continued on.</p><br/><p>\u201d It started with a \u2018Go\u2019 and ended with \u2018Ru\u2019 but as it was lost, Zirco-san tried his darnest to match at least the last word, which ended up in him ending his words with \u2018de aru\u2019. It\u2019s embarrassing, isn\u2019t it? \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Like I said, I hate verbal tics, it brings me out of the story everytime, which is why I don\u2019t translate them. But Zirco-san ends all of his sentence with de aru. I did inform you guys\u2026.no?]</p><br/><p>Calius-senpai shrugged and my mouth dropped open once again.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.That was certainly \u2018de gozaru\u2019!!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Guys, just to let you know, I won\u2019t be translating the verbal tics. I would try to remember to inform you if a character was using one, but I won\u2019t budge on this.</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t complain in the comments.</p><br/><p>Another one, Buu-san ends things with a \u2018daaaa\u2019.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a kind of dialect from a certain city in Japan, but I have no idea where.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

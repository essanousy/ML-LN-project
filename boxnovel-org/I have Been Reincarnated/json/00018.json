I received a picture book from Mother and a doll from Mary San. Hm, to tell the truth I did not really need those.</p><br/><p>But the fact that my birthday was being celebrated by anyone had already made me very happy\u2026.Let\u2019s keep it a secret that I instinctively embraced Mother.</p><br/><p>Due to his work, Father had to rush over to the edge of his territory as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wait for me and look forward to it! \u201d</p><br/><p>With that and a smile, Father left. Ah no, he was not dead yet.</p><br/><p>I had a bad feeling about this\u2026.Let\u2019s just wait without any anticipation.</p><br/><p>I trained sneakily and was able to use fire magic quite easily now.</p><br/><p>There had been a few close shaves though, like how suddenly someone would enter the room. I would cancel the magic once I heard the door opened and the important part was to put on a nonchalant face.</p><br/><p>I really did seem to have a talent in spying. Hehe.</p><br/><p>And so I would be trying a new skill today!</p><br/><p>After hearing the fact that Father was a \u2018Double\u2019, I had hopes of being one myself. Since the incantations were in Japanese, I did not need to go through the trouble to read the book. [TN: Why not? The author\u2019s hilarious.] And so, I sat on the sofa and murmured softly.</p><br/><p>\u201d [] \u201d [TN: Water, japanese Mizu]</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, I could actually cast fire chantlessly. It had been some time since I chanted so I was a little nervous. A cute \u2018Pong!\u2019 sounded and a ball of water appeared, floating in the air.</p><br/><p>I did it! That\u2019s amazing! We were indeed father and son, I was a \u2018Double\u2019 too!</p><br/><p>\u201d Yay! \u201d</p><br/><p>I was so happy that, against my better judgment, jumped on the sofa. Getting ahead, without thinking, I began to cast magic of other attributes continuously.</p><br/><p>\u201d []! []! []! []! \u201d [TN: Here we go.. Earth, wind, light, dark / shadow. Japanese, Do, Fu, Hikari, Yami.]</p><br/><p>Balls began to appear in a \u2018Pong pong pong pong\u2019 rhythm.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Eh?</p><br/><p>The Result.</p><br/><p>I can cast them all \u2728!</p><br/><p>\u201d For real..? \u201d</p><br/><p>The feeling was so unreal that I laughed. This was a dream! \u2026Was how I tried to escape but in front of my eyes, cubes of earth, spiral of wind, ball of light and something like a ball of blackness were floating in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026unt I awesume? \u201d</p><br/><p>I muttered, dumbfounded for a moment. Finally I came to my senses and, when all 4 balls of magic disappeared, did I accept reality.</p><br/><p>\u201d CHEAT CAME!!!!!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>I yelled. Wasn\u2019t it awesome?! How fun! Because the incantations were in Japanese, if I said it badly I would sound like the blue tanuki.</p><br/><p>I trembled, excited. In the heat of the moment I punched the air.</p><br/><p>And then, I remembered.</p><br/><p>\u2026hm? I was supposed to have not\u2026received any [cheat] from god\u2026</p><br/><p>But the fact that I was stuck in that pose was my retribution.</p><br/><p>The door opened with a \u2018gassha\u2019 and Mary San entered. Just nice, I was standing right in front of that door.</p><br/><p>Our eyes met.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Young Master Will\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>I knew what you want to say so please don\u2019t say it! Please don\u2019t say I was embarrassing!</p><br/><p>\u201d Mary San\u2026whatsu uppu? \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked up at Mary as I slowly lowered my raised fist. Trying to stop something, I cocked my head to the side like a child.</p><br/><p>I would definitely not say that Mary let out a snort of laughter and turned her back on me, something she rarely did.</p><br/><p>How awful! Please give me some leeway seeing that I was just a year old child!</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah. A Noble\u2019s kid would not do this kind of action.. I would take care not to do it again.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Cough. Young Master, your lunch is prepared in the dining room. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Okay, I am going\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>The trembling Mary San who was trying to bear her laughter and the depressed me.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Let\u2019s not be bothered about it.</p><br/><p>Mary San held my hand and we began walking towards the idiotically huge room.</p><br/><p>Yes, I had weaned! How\u2019s that! Was I fast or what! Though it was still only baby food but I was glad I weaned before I got addicted.</p><br/><p>Walking down the long corridor, we arrived in front of the dining room and Mary San opened the door.</p><br/><p>\u201d Thank chu\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment I said it, something lunged towards me. I backed up by reflex but sadly, I was caught.</p><br/><p>\u201d Father\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh, I am back! \u201d</p><br/><p>Aah, I had a bad feeling about this. Why not just telling me that Father was back, I thought as I looked at Mary San. Our eyes met. \u2026Ah.</p><br/><p>\u201d Have you waited long, Will? Father has brought back a huge present! \u201d</p><br/><p>Father beamed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Loads of coupons for playing with Father! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Hiyaaaaaaaaaaaa! \u201d</p><br/><p>My unpleasant premonition came true!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Will [ Your beard hurts! ]</p><br/><p>Father [ Ah, sorry. ]</p><br/><p>Will [ High up high up is scary! (It\u2019s embarrassing) ]</p><br/><p>Father [ No need to be reserve! ]</p><br/><p>Will [ NoAh. ]</p><br/><p>Father [ That\u2019s it! ]</p><br/><p>Will [ Kyaaaaaaa!!! ]</p><br/><p>Father [ Okay! Next is hide and seek! ]</p><br/><p>After a few minutes.</p><br/><p>Will [ \u2026\u2026..Exhausted. ]</p><br/><p>Will is then determined to train his body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

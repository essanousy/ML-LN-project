Thank you!</p><br/><p>Arigatou gozaiimasu!!</p><br/><p>TN: From me too! Thanks for all the love!</p><br/><p>I walked along the long and wide corridor. Even now I still could not get used to the feeling of walking on the soft carpet. I mean, stepping on this luxurious-like carpet with shoes on\u2026Wasn\u2019t it scary?</p><br/><p>Walking with my short legs, I finally reached the end. I knocked on the conspicuously huge door on the right.</p><br/><p>Acknowledgment was heard coming from inside and so I stretched myself reaching for the knob and used my entire body to push the door open.</p><br/><p>\u201d Father. \u201d</p><br/><p>The room was filled with stacks of papers and was framed by bookshelves all around.</p><br/><p>Yes, this room was Father\u2019s office and he was sitting right in the middle of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh, Will, you have come. \u201d</p><br/><p>Father was mostly buried in papers that were stacked high on his table and could be seen between the cracks.</p><br/><p>Please tidy up.</p><br/><p>I was looking at him from a distance but it seemed like he was really busy.</p><br/><p>Father was one of the rare few feudal lords who imposed good governance across his territory. Once he succeeded the position, he reduced the taxes greatly and earned the public\u2019s support. He also solved problems like from a disaster or about the soil.</p><br/><p>It was natural that he needed to merge all information about all the different places in his territory. However, I was proud of Father who was buried in it.</p><br/><p>\u201d Father, why did you call for me? \u201d</p><br/><p>This morning, Father told me to meet him at this time. As I rarely got to enter this room, I was looking around.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hey Will, if you look around that much you are going to twist your neck off. \u201d</p><br/><p>Father laughed, got out from behind the mountain and stroked my head.</p><br/><p>\u201d No I won\u2019t! \u201d</p><br/><p>I did not do that much looking around! Although it was true that I was charmed by the shelves of Spells Books\u2026I had been acting more and more like a child these few days, let\u2019s be more careful.</p><br/><p>I let out the air that I used to puff my cheeks with.</p><br/><p>\u201d So what is the matter? \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked up at Father. Damn, he was tall! \u2026He was definitely taller than 180cm. Maybe more like 190cm. It was because I was only 3 years old, but being looked down on really made me feel annoyed\u2026</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t say that I was small-minded!</p><br/><p>I would definitely grow taller in the future and leave Father in the dust!</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I was just thinking it\u2019s about time to hire a tutor for you. \u201d</p><br/><p>According to Father, the norm for nobles to hiring a tutor to teach about things like common knowledge, political movements, writing and math was usually when a child turned 5 years old. He must have thought I was ready.</p><br/><p>\u2026Well, the inner me was 17 + 3 so I was an adult already.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, it seemed like my appeal about wanting to study finally got through. Ah, it was tiring, appealing while acting like 3 years old. I could get knowledge from reading on my own but it was rather difficult to explain when people asked so I was aiming for this development!</p><br/><p>Of course, I agreed with a force as if to say \u201d Yeah! I have been waiting for this! \u201c.</p><br/><p>\u201d But Will, why are you in such a rush to study? \u201d</p><br/><p>My intention that was conveyed to my Father perfectly made him ask about the reason. It could be said that it was because of my thirst for knowledge but to tell the truth, there was another reason for it.</p><br/><p>\u201d Father is always busy right? I will study and help Father. \u201d</p><br/><p>Touched, my Father started tearing.</p><br/><p>This was quite embarrassing but it was true that I was proud of my busy Father and I genuinely wanted to help him with his work.</p><br/><p>His looks were average so I wondered if this must be what they called charisma\u2026.</p><br/><p>My father was clever and his brain turned fast. To the extent that scholars would take their hats off to him. Plus he was a \u2018double\u2019 magician. There was only 2 magicians in the royal court that were also \u2018Double\u2019 so it was not an exaggeration to say he was a great magician.</p><br/><p>And, he became a knight due to his achievements and now, a knight\u2019s leader. In short, he could be said to be the best in the nation. According to the maids\u2019 gossips, Father was revered as the nation\u2019s hero.</p><br/><p>If he walked on the street, it would be drowned in ladies\u2019 voices. \u2026Although his looks were average.</p><br/><p>Ah, even he had silly intentions sometimes but he was still my pride and someone who I yearned to become. Popular even with average looks! \u2026At the very least, not to be disliked as in my previous world\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d Thank you, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>Said Father who finally stopped crying and kept on stroking my head.</p><br/><p>With the inner me being 20 years old, I was embarrassed, but this warmth that I had not experience before in my previous life made me happy so in the end, I came to like the stroking.</p><br/><p>\u201d It is my duty! \u201d</p><br/><p>Bashfully, I stuck my chest out and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u2026It was okay to laugh, wasn\u2019t it? It might look childish but I was a child.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ahh, thank you! And, about the tutor\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Father looked troubled.</p><br/><p>\u201d What is the matter? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, no, I don\u2019t know much about the person himself\u2026 but he is definitely one of the guests at your birthday party. \u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare to see Father hesitating.</p><br/><p>\u201d Rather than saying he is a scholar working at the Royal Castle, it might be more fitting to call him a researcher\u2026 He is not a bad person but\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Eccentric? \u201d</p><br/><p>Father paused again.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026eccentric\u2026Hmm\u2026How I should explain. As the 2nd son of Viscount Veltor, he abandoned the family name\u2026 Sorry, the application was too sudden so I was not very clear on the details. A person who took great care of me in the Royal Castle told me about his great desire to work here as your tutor. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Not Veltor himself? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah no\u2026erm, would you understand if I said there\u2019s heavy taxes involved\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.I see.</p><br/><p>I might have looked at him with reproachful eyes. Flustering, Father mumbled \u201d No matter who recommended him, hiring a strange man is\u2026 \u201c.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hmm\u2026.? \u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured before turning around to face Father with a smile. That person who took care of Father must be one that was of a higher rank\u2026 Oh well, as long as I got to study. Besides, I shouldn\u2019t be willful.</p><br/><p>\u201d Father, it\u2019s okay, I understand. \u201d</p><br/><p>With a face that screamed \u2018I was saved\u2019, Father grabbed both of my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh! Try your best! \u201d</p><br/><p>As of now, the road of knowledge seemed to be full of difficulties.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: I wonder if I managed to convey the 2 sides of Will\u2019s Father? Cheat-like and Silly (limited to wife and son).</p><br/><p>Next time, a home tutor is coming. \u2026Most likely.</p><br/><p>And so, from now on yoroshiku onegaishimasu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

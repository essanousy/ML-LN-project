What a test you had given me.</p><br/><p>I wonder if all my grieving and moaning would reach your ears that seemed to be blocked by that long beard of yours.</p><br/><p>Having taken my life with that long beard of yours, would you not even hear some of my tiny wishes out?</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh\u2026 god! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d What is Will-dono doing? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, don\u2019t worry about it. He does that sometimes. \u201d</p><br/><p>To the me who was clasping my hands and grieving and moaning, the other 2 were being indifferent. Too indifferent. Yep, everyone\u2019s cruel. How awful! Anyway, there was no one who could understand my anguish!</p><br/><p>\u201d There is no one who understands me\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>My shoulders fell and I got even more depressed. Then, a hand reached out from behind and patted my shoulders gently.</p><br/><p>\u201d As expected of my master, a perfect chuunibyo! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.You were the last person I wanted to hear that from.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it fine? Leave me alone to grieve.</p><br/><p>Because you see, usually when you save people from being enslaved, wouldn\u2019t you get a cute girl\u2019s love or admiration?</p><br/><p>But no!</p><br/><p>Why did I get an address-unknown-jobless man instead?! I don\u2019t need it, I don\u2019t need him the most! But I couldn\u2019t say it into his face because he did become jobless thanks to me. I was not a kid who could just wave \u2018Goodbye!\u2019 and left him alone. Ah, although I did look like one.</p><br/><p>Or rather, I am older than him! He was only 23!</p><br/><p>Plus, he declared \u2018 Children shouldn\u2019t worry about this, it is my own decision after all. \u2018 and timidly stroked my head. Him, with his fierce-looking face while smiling awkwardly, like he was not used to it, said that to me!</p><br/><p>I do not blame him. I can\u2019t blame him.</p><br/><p>But! Then! But then!</p><br/><p>I knew I had an average face. But when this kind of incident (event) happened, I can\u2019t be blamed for expecting an encounter with the opposite sex! And I got an address-unknown-jobless-fierce-looking Onii-san instead! No flag was raised at all!</p><br/><p>Eh? He was an ikemen former soldier?</p><br/><p>\u2026.That\u2019s not it! That\u2019s totally not it!</p><br/><p>Listen, I am straight. I was very reluctant and was pushed into cross-dressing by Zirco-san. I would be troubled if you misunderstand. I do not like men. I like girls. I lust for girls! \u2026..That last part came out a bit wrong.</p><br/><p>Anyway, in any case.</p><br/><p>I was totally justified in grieving!!!!</p><br/><p>Without thinking, my eyes were squeezed shut and my hands were clenched tight. Forgive me, I went a little over. I am a gentleman and a Duke\u2019s son. I shouldn\u2019t be blaming this poor man who lose his job because of me in front of Shiro, and it would do me no good to continue lamenting like this.</p><br/><p>Eh? Don\u2019t even lament in the first place? Shut up! There were times where I just can\u2019t help it!</p><br/><p>I glanced at the fierce-looking-address-unknown-jobless Onii-san who passed out and was carried by Shiro, and the sigh that came out of my mouth was my respect to him. Definitely.</p><br/><p>Those beastmen children that I rescued had either a family or was a part of a merchant\u2019s caravan so they would have a place to return to. That was one case closed. That was not too bad.</p><br/><p>The reason they were all so scared was due to this place\u2019s discrimination. They had thought I was from Hattuo. I was taught that by an Uncle who grasped and shook my hand as he cried tears of joy. Tears from an Uncle\u2026</p><br/><p>But still, he seemed to be the chairman of a pretty big firm in Dyuvu so he had to fund to offer as a reward. His eyes were shining and sparkling as he gave his thanks and offered the reward but I turned him down.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026His energy was scary.</p><br/><p>But don\u2019t they check the inn they were about to stay beforehand? It was weird for a big firm not to do so. But the kid might be kidnapped when they were engrossed in their conversation. You should be more careful.</p><br/><p>The soldier\u2019s captain was working with former general Grousil for money it seemed. Originally a country without any rights for Beastmen, this kidnapping incident in Flowason turned into something big.</p><br/><p>By the way, the Captain was grilled by Zirco-san. It was for the best. And when I said that, that expressionless face somehow grew even scarier.</p><br/><p>Former general was after all, a former general. And it seemed like his court rank was taken down as well. Poor thing.</p><br/><p>Which means, that Pig bastard and his happy band of kidnappers were just normal criminals. He did not even have a noble rank to help him. And right now, he was locked up in the military prison.</p><br/><p>Because for some reason (\u2026.), he was beaten by all the soldiers in the barracks.</p><br/><p>If that were the case, what about our cover\u2026. was what worried me but I was an idiot. The best Intelligence Corp Leader, was a ninja. He performed an [Oblivion Technique] on the soldiers. As expected of a ninja! He moved exactly like one!</p><br/><p>I must be imagining things when I thought I heard Shiro saying \u2018 Did he not just hit the back of their heads? \u2018 behind me.</p><br/><p>I was surprised at how easily the soldiers were allowed to quit easily. Was that really okay, Hattuo\u2019s military?</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Letting them quit so easily\u2026 Are they not worried about the country\u2019s classified information? \u201d</p><br/><p>At my mumbling, Zirco-san turned back and looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Ah, they are only normal soldiers who know nothing, the lowest in rank. The rules are rather lax since they are not in war right now. A lowly soldier stuffed in the barracks of the border of the country. This is the extent of a rogue who wanted a job as a soldier. Which is why, if the person himself wanted to quit, they let him. The military is not lacking in manpower\u2026 In short, they are simply discardable pieces. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d The lowest\u2026. discardable\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco-san might be right. Hattuo does not have an education system so there are many who do not even know how to use magic. These soldiers were all commoners. So to stay or to leave was all up to them. That\u2019s all there is to it. Zirco-san, you were really saying some mean stuff with that emotionless face.</p><br/><p>Things like the lowest\u2026!</p><br/><p>Things like discardable pieces\u2026!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s too frank.</p><br/><p>\u201d Besides, frankly saying, the soldiers in the checkpoint are already crooked. Hattuo doesn\u2019t really understand the concept of a \u2018border\u2019 in the first place plus the values of their population are skewed with the discrimination against Beastmen. Elzmu is the only country truly managing their border and the people who enter. To the rest of the country, the checkpoint is a remote region so being sent there is seen as a demotion. That\u2019s why, the soldiers here are all rogues or the worst. \u201d</p><br/><p>He was going franker by the minute!!</p><br/><p>Lower than rogues\u2026! No wait, in that case, why was there a soldier with such overflowing sense of justice like Onii-san here? Question of the century.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Shiro, why did he faint? \u201d</p><br/><p>I asked, trying to change the topic. Shiro, who was walking beside me, turned and looked at me slowly. He was stooping a little, as if making sure Onii-san would not fall off. His face was serious and had a frown on it.</p><br/><p>\u201d That is because\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Our eyes met.</p><br/><p>\u201d Because\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>I swallowed my saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..he exhausted his mana as well as his stamina. \u201d</p><br/><p>Shiro said smugly.</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t have to draw it out!</p><br/><p>Damn it! I knew it would be this kind of punch line!</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>What should I do with the paper fan I took out reflexively? I can\u2019t really hit Shiro as he was carrying a man on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201d Urgh\u2026.Did you plan this, Shiro? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ho ho ho! Master is still so young! \u201d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s ignore the grinning Shiro. I don\u2019t mind it at all. I am not a kid after all. I am a wonderful 25 years old gentleman.</p><br/><p>\u201d Kuu\u2026.. don\u2019t push your luck! Remember this! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Fu fu fu\u2026 Keep barking, keep barking. Empty pipes makes the most noise! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d This long-haired bastard!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Since we solved this incident, fooling around like this was not too bad.</p><br/><p>\u201d What, cross-dresser boy (hentai/pervert)? \u201d</p><br/><p>I take it back.</p><br/><p>\u201d Urgh! \u201d</p><br/><p>The paper fan hit Shiro\u2019s face hard. This guy, right at my sore spot~!! Remembering my outfit, I stormed ahead, face flushed red.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wai\u2026 Master, wait, it was quite painful! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Will-dono\u2019s way of speech\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, don\u2019t mind it. He does that quite often. \u201d</p><br/><p>Those behind, what were you guys talking about? Their view of me\u2026</p><br/><p>I will lose if I mind it.</p><br/><p>Yep,</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll lose if I mind it.</p><br/><p>I raised my head up.</p><br/><p>Aah, the sky was red. The cloudless sky looked cold and empty, as if hinting of the coldness of Flowason\u2019s street.</p><br/><p>My heart was cold as well. Come to think of it, we were comrades. My friend.</p><br/><p>\u201d Aah, I want to go home. \u201d</p><br/><p>And I pray that I would be released from the cross-dressing. Let\u2019s just forget about the fact that I did not tell Father about this trip, only the King, and that I missed the summoned beast class this week.</p><br/><p>My friend. Please don\u2019t shine your reddish glow onto my face. I\u2019ll look like I am still blushing.</p><br/><p>I walked in the cold weather with my friend, as evening approached while I tried to cool down my burning cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

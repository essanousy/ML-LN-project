Satisfied, Guta smirked as he slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, your last job. I\u2019m relying on you. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d As you command. \u201d</p><br/><p>With that sentence, mana swirled around Spinel and he disappeared from the room. Within the next few minutes, even the remaining mana had dispersed and the only one left in the Emperor\u2019s private room was Guta. Adjusting his posture, he reached for the bell and shook it violently.</p><br/><p>Things to throw, things to remain and things to add to his hand. Looking at everything, he wondered which the way he would gain a profit and how he would make a loss. This all depended on his ability. Guta smirked to himself and looked outside the window. Another 2 months and the scenery would be dyed white. Even the forest and the grass-covered plains.</p><br/><p>What Guta wished for was for the country and his people to thrive and only that.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Spinel felt like cursing and yet despite that, felt refreshed.</p><br/><p>What should he do. It was his dream to die while on a mission. That was what it meant to be a Shadow. It was a job that robbed people of their lives so he should lay his own life on the line as well.</p><br/><p>He had come a long way by doing that. He knew what he was doing and his logic was deemed wrong by the common sense of this world. Having said that, he had never once thought he was wrong. Which was why he placed his life for this mission too. Rather, he was happy he got to live and die as a Shadow.</p><br/><p>But, what about Spinel himself?</p><br/><p>He had never hold his life dear but he had this out-of-place feeling that he could never erase and it had accumulated into irritation. He wondered why he felt that way.</p><br/><p>As a chess piece for his owner, he thought that the best way was to use his life as a smokescreen to keep the enemy away from his owner. If that would make his owner happy, he had fulfilled his job perfectly.</p><br/><p>But then why?</p><br/><p>In the end, he can\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>Was this really the best way? Was there no other methods?</p><br/><p>Had the enemy already known this much?</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s simpler.</p><br/><p>He could not comprehend it. Even if he did see it with his own eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026..The enemy\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>He could not accept Williams Beryl\u2019s power. He did not believe it. It shouldn\u2019t be like this.</p><br/><p>He swallowed his words. If he were to say it out loud, his pride as a Shadow would be totally lost.</p><br/><p>\u201d How troublesome\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..Even if he died, it might not work against the enemy. He gave a small laugh and stood up to prepare. The human that the perfect Shadow (human) was about to confront was an unimaginable monster.</p><br/><p>His owner should know about it.</p><br/><p>In the dark room, only Spinel\u2019s mocking laugh remained.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Is the development for the Demon Forest prohibited? \u201d</p><br/><p>The long black hair. The strangely sexy sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s right. I haven\u2019t taught you about that, did I? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, the one standing in front of us was John-sensei. Possessing a muscular body despite being a scholar, a super ikemen despite his level of intellect, long silky hair and glasses, a super \u2018S\u2019 person.</p><br/><p>He was the enemy of all men.</p><br/><p>By the way, me included. But his only saving grace was that he was married to his research.</p><br/><p>That hidden meaning of \u2018you knew about it despite me not teaching you\u2019 in his words only made it difficult to answer. Of course I knew about it. I learned about geography in the previous world. But even so, John-sensei should be fired for \u2018neglect of duty\u2019 for not teaching me!</p><br/><p>\u2026.. Was something I could never say out loud so I only glared at the map, mumbling under my breath.</p><br/><p>I am currently at the research lab in the castle. Why am I here?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a long story but by some twist and turns I ended up here. Eh? You won\u2019t understand if I don\u2019t explain the twist and turns? Hmm. it can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019ll explain so listen up.</p><br/><p>\u2026.ah, who the heck am I talking to.</p><br/><p>On the day Caralsdoni was captured, I was extremely irritated at myself after hearing Buu-san\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>So I had decided. Attacking is the best defense.</p><br/><p>If I stayed like this, waiting for the enemy to attack, it just looked like I am inviting them to come. They had the upper-hand.</p><br/><p>The point I am making was, I am going to crush them. For Zirco, he was worried about civilians being injured.</p><br/><p>For me\u2026\u2026..yep.</p><br/><p>I shall show them the consequences for raising a hand against the people I loved. Eh? No matter the reason, a murder is a crime you say? I said nothing about killing. Although I didn\u2019t agree with your reason, I did not particularly think about killing.</p><br/><p>Shall I do it then?</p><br/><p>And my smile when I was thinking about these things made Buu-san shiver.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Tee-hee.</p><br/><p>Okay, enough with the jokes. The enemy was someone who used the Shadows and even summoned beast like Abi and, even if the security was laxer at the May festival, managed to release them at the heavily guarded Academy and caused people to get injured. There was no need to stay silent and watch them throw their weight around any longer.</p><br/><p>Get them before they do anything. For the nation\u2019s sake, we could only move!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Although I am bearing a personal grudge as well.</p><br/><p>Which was why I am investigating along with Black Knights-san. I shall assume it\u2019s my imagination that I heard someone saying I am abusing my social status. Yep. It was not like the rest saw it as the son of Beryl hopping on to the investigation just to play at being a detective. Nope, no one saw it that way.</p><br/><p>Oh well.</p><br/><p>I too, asked Zirco-san\u2019s for his authority and name and got myself approved for having top-notch spy-techniques as ascertained by former Shadows, Buu-san and Bibinyaru-san. This is the result of all the sneaking around I did when I was young. Wonderful.</p><br/><p>I really do have the talent for spying.</p><br/><p>Th, things like society\u2026.. like school\u2026.hm, yea\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I am not worried about being seen like I am playing truant just because I cannot reveal the reason. I am not afraid of Selphy\u2019s scornful eyes. I am also not sad about missing the lesson today on how to handle summoned beasts. My summoned beast Shiro had experience so all I need to do was to ask Senpai. I am not afraid of Varino-sensei\u2019s icy attitude too. Not a bit. No, I am not trembling.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Actually, all I need was to take the test at August for grade-skipping and all thanks to a certain someone, there was no worry about the contents of the test.</p><br/><p>Hm? \u2026\u2026I kinda feel cold\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>Lost in my thoughts, a kind and gentle smiling face appeared right in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, nothing. I am sorry, please continue. \u201d</p><br/><p>This person could definitely read my mind. John-sensei, after so long, I still fear you.</p><br/><p>\u201d But why the sudden topic about the Demon Forest? \u201d</p><br/><p>As if he could sense my feelings of regret, John-sensei returned back to the topic without skipping a beat.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am looking for a remote, isolated place. Since we are certain that the Shadows were involved, we are looking for their base. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Sorry for not being of use. \u201d</p><br/><p>Buu-san said sorrowfully, looking like he shrank in front of Zirco-san. Looking at the 2 of them, John-sensei folded his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201d I see. \u201d</p><br/><p>Oh yes, you should had known it by now but this is John-sensei\u2019s research lab. During the 2 years when I was in the Academy, John-sensei went back to the court and continued his research. After being recognized as a scholar of the Duke class, he got promoted from the professor\u2019s assistant to a professor at once. Ah, congratulations on your promotion.</p><br/><p>Anyway, the King should have his reason for doing do. But the main reason should be that he was a well-rounded scholar well-versed in magic circles, mathematics, history, geography and also 1 of the people who knew the truth about the incident 3 years ago.</p><br/><p>Head of the Intelligence Corps, Zirco-san, wanted advice on the recent information as well as the history and geography of it and also about the Shadows. But as the information about the incident 3 years ago was classified, it can\u2019t be told to normal court scholars. The only one that fulfilled all conditions was John-sensei.</p><br/><p>Of course, we would need the help of the 2 former Shadows too. By the way, Bibinyaru-san was being introduced as a normal merchant just in case if there were complaints, at least one of them would not be affected. The populace was terrifying at times.</p><br/><p>\u201d I got the gist of it. The Academy was under attack and although Will defeated Abi, it caused Caralsdoni-san and even his girl friend to be pulled into the mess and got injured. Which is why he is looking for the Shadow\u2019s base. I see.. \u201d</p><br/><p>You definitely was not \u2018seeing\u2019! The words \u2018why is Will poking his nose into this?\u2019 written all over your face! But I won\u2019t back down on this. I am a man too, I do have my pride!</p><br/><p>Staring at Sensei timidly, he then gave a snort of laughter.</p><br/><p>Uuuuuhhh\u2026..This super \u2018S\u2019!</p><br/><p>It had been some time since we met so I had forgotten about it but this was the kind of person he was. Thankfully, in the presence of Zirco, he did tone it down a bit. But his next sentence caught me.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am kidding, Will. You must be asked along by that person over there. He is a person that would use anyone that could be used. \u201d</p><br/><p>He called Zirco \u2018that person\u2019\u2026! Shocking! Too shocking! Could it be they knew each other? Do they? Do they??</p><br/><p>Noticing my gaze, Zirco laughed wryly.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.I had his help a couple of times. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.Ohhh.</p><br/><p>My face at that time should be showing a dumbfounded expression. It seem like there was no \u2018normal\u2019 with John-sensei.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d You think the the Demon Forest of the East had the best place for the Shadows to build their base, am I right? \u201d</p><br/><p>John-sensei put his glasses on. I admired how he looked like he just transformed. For normal people like me, we would be simply looking like we\u2019re wearing glasses.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, somehow his gaze was warm.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Only you would say such crazy things. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Sighing for some reason, John-sensei looked around the bookshelves before pulling a volume out. The book was locked with a mana-recognizing lock.</p><br/><p>Woah, classified indeed!</p><br/><p>The lock opened easily when John-sensei poured his mana in. If anyone other than John-sensei tried to open it, the pages would then stick together and the book can\u2019t be opened. On the spine of the book, \u300a\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30f3\u300b[TN: John Maryoku ninshoshiki kaihen, open and close by John\u2019s mana/magic] was written.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026It was me who taught him how to write that though.</p><br/><p>So he was using it in this manner. I am impressed by his way of thinking. As expected of a scholar. Once again, I am reminded of how amazing John-sensei was.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015If you raise a hand against the Demon Forests, calamity would befall you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>This was a superstition known not only in Elzmu, but throughout the whole world. I interpreted it as a huge disaster had once happened in the past, maybe like a landslide, and this was passed down to prevent it from happening again. But even so, with that ominous sounding warning, no one in their right mind would want to develop the forest. Plus, magic existed in this world so it was normal to believe that warning.</p><br/><p>Which was why it would make a perfect hiding place. John-sensei then looked at me with that warm gaze again.</p><br/><p>\u201d Impossible. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..Ah, okay.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: OH! Merry Christmas!</p><br/><p>By the way, this is the last chapter of this arc.</p><br/><p>After this, I won\u2019t be continuing the story but will instead translate the interlude [Summer Holidays] as well as all the digest chapters until it has caught up to this chapter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

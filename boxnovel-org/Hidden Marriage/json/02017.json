She had always sold her image as being \u201cunique\u201d, parading herself as a \u201cfresh drink of water in the entertainment industry\u201d, and for being a super popular and encouraging goddess. The history of her rising to fame was so \u201cmarvelous and outstanding\u201d that in reality, it may be compared to a melodrama.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s trip was really worth it! It really was an eye-opener!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Xudong is a married man. Han Zixuan should know better about selling her body and sleeping around as the third party, yet she could still demand fairness for Ning Xueluo in such a justified manner! The funniest thing is that earlier, she actually said that she hated third parties who wrecked homes the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt turns out that she had intentionally imitated Ning Xi back then, stolen Ning Xi\u2019s resources, and stepped on Ning Xi to make it to the top. However, she keeps telling the others that she\u2019s unique, and doesn\u2019t care about being compared to Ning Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really gained some knowledge and experience today! There are mountains beyond mountains! Her face is really as thick as the city walls!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that Han Zixuan\u2019s acting skills aren\u2019t as good as Ning Xi\u2019s? Han Zixuan is practically the \u201cqueen actress\u201d in the entertainment industry who deserves an award!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, all of the reporters had left Ning Xi\u2019s side to rush to Han Zixuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Han Zixuan, is the person in the video you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay we know if you really seduced your superior who\u2019s married, and relied on dirty tricks to rise to the top?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know that Yi Xudong already has a wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou pose yourself as righteous, yet you did the thing that you kept saying was shameless. What do you have to say about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Earlier, all of the questions that had been thrown to Ning Xi were now being asked to Han Zixuan.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan bit on her lip. There were insanity and darkness in her eyes. The deathly gaze she shot Ning Xi said that she wished she could swallow her whole.</p><br/><p>She took a deep breath and used up all of her energy to force herself to be calm. Then, she said with an expression that feigned a clear conscience, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you guys are talking about. The woman in this video isn\u2019t even me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru quickly echoed, \u201cWhere did they find some despicable porn star? How dare they pretend to be our Zixuan? Ning Xi, I want to sue your people for slander and infringement of the right to one\u2019s reputation! Do you think that smearing Zixuan can get you in the clear? No matter what, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re dirty and lowly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao seemed to have expected that they would say this, so he unhurriedly sneered, \u201cHuh, earlier the video was clear enough. Han Zixuan and Yi Xudong did such indescribable things in Glory World Entertainment\u2019s office, and in Han Zixuan\u2019s company car. Entering Glory World Entertainment requires fingerprinting. We don\u2019t need any further explanation for Zixuan\u2019s private company car either. Can this be a fake? You should fake it for me to see!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xu Tao spoke, a few extremely clear screenshots appeared on the huge screen instantly. There was a picture was of Yi Xudong\u2019s office, while another was the car plate number of the company car, and the scene of Han Zixuan holding the car key to open the car door.</p><br/><p>Shining evidence had once again slapped their face hard. At this moment, everyone\u2019s gaze at the two people had reached the peak of contempt.</p></div>\n</div>"}

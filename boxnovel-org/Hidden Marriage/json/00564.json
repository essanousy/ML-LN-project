The one beside her should be her mother, the president of Ling Horizon Fashion, Guo Hui. Ning Yaohua and Zhuang Lingyu were welcoming her warmly.</p><br/><p>Despite the constant flow of guests, Ning Xueluo was able to chat up with almost all of them. The guests looked at Ning Xueluo in a different light, awed by her.</p><br/><p>\"This girl is really something, she has a such a wide connection despite her young age!\"</p><br/><p>\"Sigh, it\u2019s really frustrating when I compare my kid at home with her. She always dreamt about being a star but after spending so much money, there isn\u2019t even a shadow of her on screen! Unlike Ning Xueluo with her own business and her own company!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A servant who was serving guests outside suddenly came rushing in and panted, \"Master...outside...outside\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua asked sternly, \"What's happened outside? Do you know how inappropriate it is for you to freak out in front of the guests?!\"</p><br/><p>The servant continued worriedly, \"No, Master! There\u2019re...there\u2019re important guests! Very important guests!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua was still unhappy. \"Who is it that made you freak out?\"</p><br/><p>With the Ning family\u2019s position, the servant did not need to freak out even if the guests were from a renowned family.</p><br/><p>In the corner, Ning Xi was curious of the servant\u2019s expression. Who did Ning Xueluo involve herself with this time?</p><br/><p>The servant explained, \"Just now...there was a car stopped in front of the entrance...but no one came out of the car. It was just parked there, so I paid it no mind but the car looked really prestigious. Then, I checked the number plate and it seems like...it\u2019s a car from the Lu family!\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the servant, Ning Yaohua and Zhuang Lingyu were concerned. \"What? Lu family? Which Lu family?\"</p><br/><p>The servant trembled, \"Lu...Lu Corporation\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spurted out her fruit juice.</p><br/><p>What?!</p><br/><p>Lu Corporation?</p><br/><p>Could it be...Lu Tingxiao?</p><br/><p>It could not be! Why would the devil be here?</p><br/><p>\"Uhm...Sis Xin, I\u2019ll excuse myself to make a phone call first!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was still worried as she went outside to give Lu Tingxiao a call.</p><br/><p>The phone call was picked up after ringing only once and a man\u2019s deep voice came through, \"Hey.\"</p><br/><p>It was quiet on the other side of the phone and she could not determine where he was.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gulped and asked, \"Hey...Lu Tingxiao, where are you right now?\"</p><br/><p>\"At the entrance of the Ning residence.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was annoyed. \"What are you doing? Why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Because you didn\u2019t come back. Little Treasure was crying for you.\"</p><br/><p>Her hard features softened when she heard about her baby Little Treasure. \"Ah, I\u2019m really sorry, I didn\u2019t expect to stay here for so long either but I\u2019m going to be done soon and I\u2019ll be back as quick as I can!\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, we\u2019ll wait for you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>She actually meant for him to go back with Little Treasure first...what if something happened and she had to stay longer?</p><br/><p>As she was thinking of how to persuade them to leave first, there was a noise from the other end of the line, like the phone was being passed and a weak voice came through this time, \"Sister-in-law, I was almost frozen to icicles by this two cold people while waiting for you! When will you be done? Please come back soon.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

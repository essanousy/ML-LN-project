It looks like Han Zixuan's job-hopping had a huge impact on Glory World Entertainment. Once the leader of the entertainment industry, it is now rapidly waning. I'm afraid they're about to withdraw from the history of entertainment...\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's wandering thoughts came back when she saw this news.</p><br/><p>She looked blankly at herself, then observed the town.</p><br/><p>Was she dreaming?</p><br/><p>Where was this? Why was she here after she woke up? Where was Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure?</p><br/><p>Was Little Treasure not kidnapped by Qiao Yi?</p><br/><p>However, it did not feel real\u2026</p><br/><p>She could not understand the entertainment news from the television at all.</p><br/><p>Who was Han Zixuan?</p><br/><p>Was Glory World Entertainment dwindling?</p><br/><p>She looked up at the television, but the news had ended. The old man changed the channel and was enjoying his soap opera.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's eyes were set on the newspapers in front of the stall as she said gently, \"Bo-\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Her voice was hoarse like sandpaper rubbing together. Were her vocal cords injured as well?</p><br/><p>\"Boss\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi tried again. It went much smoother this time.</p><br/><p>It did not feel like she was injured; more like she had not spoken for a long time and had not adapted to it.</p><br/><p>\"I'm here! What do you need?\" The uncle peeled his eyes off the television and looked at the girl in front of his stall.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the owner was stunned. He did not even realize the cup was overflowing while he kept pouring alcohol into it as he just stared at Ning Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>The girl did not put on any makeup or accessories. She had waist-long black hair and was wearing a white skirt with some little flowers on it. The immense flower bed behind her was not able to steal the highlight away from her\u2026</p><br/><p>Simply too beautiful\u2026</p><br/><p>She was like an angel that had fallen from the sky\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Boss?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi called him a few times before he came back to his senses. \"Ah... You... What do you need?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry. I didn't bring any money out... May I have a look at these newspapers?\"</p><br/><p>\"S-sure! Of course! Feel free to look around!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took up the nearest paper and flipped to the entertainment news.</p><br/><p>The headline consisted of a picture from a scene. The woman in the picture was wearing an ancient, red Oriental dress. She sat on the yellow sand with a big earthen jar of Chinese wine beside her. With her bright red lips, elegant eyebrows, she was a rampant beauty\u2026</p><br/><p>The title of the headline was \"Guo Qisheng Directing The TV Series of 'The World', Han Zixuan Confirmed to Take Up the Role Of Meng Changge\".</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan\u2026</p><br/><p>This name again\u2026</p><br/><p>Was Guo Qisheng making a TV series of \"The World\"?</p><br/><p>How was that possible?</p><br/><p>She never heard about it before!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi flipped through several other newspapers and realized that the name Han Zixuan appeared frequently. Most of the newspapers and magazines were talking about her.</p><br/><p>She even saw an ambiguous photo of her and Jiang Muye\u2026</p><br/><p>The two of them were kissing in a dark bar. While the image was unclear, it was obvious that the man in the picture was Jiang Muye\u2026</p><br/><p>What had happened?</p><br/><p>After a night's sleep\u2026</p><br/><p>The whole world had changed so much!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

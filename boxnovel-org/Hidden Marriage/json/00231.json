She then put on so much smoky makeup, her own mother wouldn\u2019t recognize her.</p><br/><p>People know that at midnight Cinderella put on a gorgeous dress and drove her pumpkin carriage to the palace to see the prince. She on the other hand, does her makeup in the middle of the night, and heads to nightclubs to escape from the big devil\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Hey\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>These past two days Lu Ting Xiao has been busy, at this time he should be awake, right?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went to the balcony, in the direction of the study and sure enough, Lu Ting Xiao is still in there with the desk lamp lit.</p><br/><p>So, she decisively ran and knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>She is trying to flash him, blind his eyes!</p><br/><p>Bang bang bang. There were three knocks on the door, a pause as footsteps approached, then the door opened.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao expecting to see people outside, looks slightly startled, \u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had a friend ask me out to drink so I came over to tell you!\u201d Ning Xi said, looking forward to Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s look of surprise disappears and he nodded as if not noticing her exaggerated outfit, \u201cWell, have fun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said that, he continued, \u201cI don\u2019t need to ask the driver to take you right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi just stared blankly, \u201cWell\u2026no. I planned on riding my bike\u2026\u201dshe took a deep breath to cheer up then turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao suddenly came towards her.</p><br/><p>What does he want?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi subconsciously took a step back, but still did not escape Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s hand. His fingers touched her earlobes and gently squeezed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s body hairs stood up one by one, and her dazed look landed on Lu Ting Xiao.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s mouth is crooked imperceptibly and he points to the spot where he touched, \u201cYou have a little black mole here\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d What does her mole have to do with anything?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s brain is already in chaos, she is simply unable to comprehend his current logic</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are wearing this outfit and makeup so although most people won\u2019t recognize you, this mole is very iconic and completely exposed. It\u2019s best if you cover</p><br/><p>it.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stood two steps away and said, \u201cIt\u2019s only a mole. No one will be paying attention to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re not being unreasonable. I will go and put on some large earrings to cover it up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the brief confrontation, Ning Xi finally strode away from the door.</p><br/><p>The round has only just begun, so how has she already lost this badly?</p><br/><p>No, No, No! She has to break the superstition of the big devil!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The bar.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was enjoying the rare indulgence of sitting by herself at a bar, ordering a bottle of wine, and pouring it at your own discretion.</p><br/><p>She was holding her glass and staring disinterestedly at the dance floor, full of people dancing morbidly.</p><br/><p>Nightclubs and bars, from all her years abroad are no longer fresh and new to her. The fervent displays that she sees are no longer funny to her\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A bottle of wine in her belly, Ning Xi also ordered a second bottle.</p><br/><p>The alcohol did not let her relax, but made her even more upset.</p><br/><p>At this time, a man carrying a glass of wine in his hand came over her, \u201cMiss, need a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looks like he is more than 30 years old, is dressed, looks, and acts like an elite.</p><br/><p>In the time, it took her to drink her bottle of wine, there have been a lot of men who noticed her at the bar. But Ning Xi has the look of a veteran, most of the people didn\u2019t dare take a shot at her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

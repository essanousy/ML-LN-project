Say that I want to harm my own child!</em></p><br/><p><em>Say it, then look around this room to see who will believe you?</em></p><br/><p><em>Who would believe that I would swallow those pills and kill my own child?</em></p><br/><p>On the side, Ning Qiutong frowned. She was about to say something, but Ning Xi stopped her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s gaze swept across everyone with ease as the edges of her mouth curled up, outlining a cold smile. \u201cSo what if it was me? Forget about the child. Even if I wanted to poison her to death as well, what can you guys do to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant Ning Xi said that, everyone in the room\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>Su Yan, who had been having mixed feelings, suddenly looked startled as he was in disbelief. \u201cXiao Xi, you\u2026 It was really you who did it all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the truth was right before him, after listening to Ning Xi admit it herself, he still could not accept it.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu and Ning Yaohua were like savages who just saw fresh blood spilled. They wanted to rip her apart. \u201cYou animal! Animal! What sin did our Ning family do to create such an evil, shameful thing!? You won\u2019t even let go of your own brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God! She actually dared to admit it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOtherwise? There\u2019s solid evidence. She can\u2019t run away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even look remorseful after doing such a thing. She\u2019s even so arrogant, she\u2019s too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, not only Zhuang Lingyu and Ning Yaohua, but Zheng Minjun and Su Hongguang seemed aghast too.</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun rushed out to start scolding, \u201cYou cruel woman! Even if you like our Su Yan that much and want to enter the Su family, you can\u2019t kill Su Yan\u2019s child! This is Su Yan\u2019s flesh and blood! Now, you\u2019re just taking it out on the child. If, in the future, you really became part of the Su family, if anything doesn\u2019t suit your taste even a little, are you going to harm me too!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang did not expect that, as the heir of the Zhuang family, Ning Xi\u2019s morale would stoop to this poor extent.</p><br/><p>This was not a small matter of jealousy. This was murder!</p><br/><p>After she killed someone, she could still appear so remorseless and at ease. How terrifying was this woman?</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu gripped her chest that began to ache from rage. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than a beast! You\u2019re despicable and lowly. You\u2019re not even a millionth of Xueluo, yet you\u2019re still deluded about marrying into the Su family. You\u2019re deluded about stealing Xueluo\u2019s husband! Look at yourself! Do you think you\u2019re even qualified in the least?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang\u2019s expression was solemn as he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Yaohua. Even though Ning Xi is your daughter, she has implicated a human life. I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t just let things go so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun immediately shouted emotionally, \u201cShe killed my grandchild. Of course, we have to report her to the police!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi heard this, she raised her brows slightly. \u201cOh, report me to the police?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon seeing Ning Xi\u2019s fearless attitude, Ning Yaohua became madder. \u201cAnimal! I don\u2019t care who you have backing you or who\u2019s supporting you! If this matter isn\u2019t resolved, don\u2019t think about going anywhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, he had still been a little wary of the Zhuang family, but when he thought about the Zhuang family\u2019s strict ways, if they knew what Ning Xi had done, they would be the first ones to not spare her.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu sneered. \u201cYou look so sure about being backed up. You\u2019re probably relying on a gold mine that you have!\u201d</p><br/><p>For Zhuang Lingyu to say so as her mother, everyone else in the house judged Ning Xi with an even stranger expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were already rumors that she was taken in as a mistress. It turns out that it\u2019s real!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone like this actually thought of marrying our Su Yan. What a joke!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, all the little celebrities really aren\u2019t self-aware at all. All of them just want personal gain and they rack their brains, thinking about marrying into a rich family. They\u2019ll dare to use all sorts of tricks, but they won\u2019t consider what trash they are!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

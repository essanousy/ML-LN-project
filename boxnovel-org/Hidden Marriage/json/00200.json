The past few months he had really changed. Ever since he met Ning Xi, it could be said that he had been reborn.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t want him to revert back to his old behavior, and become even more frightening.</p><br/><p>He decided he would go to the temple tomorrow for his brother and kneel for awhile.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\nInstead of looking at the manuscript, Ning Xi had been lying in bed for more than two hours.</p><br/><p>There was nothing in her mind, it was completely blank.\nWhen she met a situation that\u2019s extremely difficult to resolve, she would try to ease the pressure in a productive matter. When that didn\u2019t work, she would have to find a more extreme method\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>But it had been such a long time since she\u2019d been bothered by something this difficult.</p><br/><p>Looking at the clock on the wall, the time was almost ten o\u2019clock. Ning Xi got up and reviewed the information Lin Zhizhi gave her. It took her an hour to memorize it all.</p><br/><p>Her lines were solid, after all these things were quite simple.</p><br/><p>At this time, she found it strange that the little bun hadn\u2019t come to see her all night. Lu Ting Xiao had probably told Little Treasure that she was busy.</p><br/><p>After memorizing the information, Ning Xi was ready to see the little bun.</p><br/><p>\nWhen she got to the little bun\u2019s room, Ning Xi thought he must be sleeping and pushed the door open gently.</p><br/><p>As a result, through the crack she could see warm yellow lights on beside the bed.</p><br/><p>She saw the little bun sitting on his bed focused entirely on his Rubik\u2019s cube. Lu Ting Xiao was also sitting on the bed, his cold face showing a hint of frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s now 10:54. There are six minutes until eleven\u201d Lu Ting Xiao said.\nThe implied meaning was it\u2019s late, go to sleep.\nThe little bun continued playing as if he didn\u2019t hear anything. He continued turning the cube around, taking a few seconds to assemble each side to make the colors consistent. Then he dismantled it and repeated the process.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao picked up a book up from the drawers next to the bed. The cover had flowers, a small rabbit and a wolf\u2019s face; a book of fairy tales. His face expressionless, he asked Little Treasure, \u201cWant to hear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little treasure finally looked up and stared at Lu Ting Xiao, his eyes full of disdain.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao pinched the bridge of his nose, \u201cBook about a prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure glared.</p><br/><p>\u201cA brief history of time?\u201d Little Treasure ignored him.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao finally gave up, looking at his watch, his face became gloomy, \u201cIt\u2019s already eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Lu Ting Xiao was about to get angry, Ning Xi quickly knocked on the door, opening it fully.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure darling, why are you still up?\u201dNing Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Before she finished speaking, the little bun has dashed off the bed like a small whirlwind throwing away his cube. He quickly clung to her calf, his small head upturned, his large eyes blinking sweetly at her.\nNing Xi\u2019s heart twanged, unable to take the cuteness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

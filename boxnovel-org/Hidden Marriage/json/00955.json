Is...this really Lu Tingxiao\u2019s son? Are you sure?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded proudly. \"A hundred percent! He\u2019s definitely Lu Tingxiao\u2019s son and he\u2019s called Little Treasure. What do you think? I\u2019ve not been lying, he\u2019s really cute, isn't he?\"</p><br/><p>Annie nodded her head vigorously. \"Way too cute! What should I do!? I didn\u2019t prepare any gifts for you!\"</p><br/><p>Annie was looking around at herself and in her bag. Then, she took out some candy, a chocolate bar, a pill, and even her necklace and gave them all to the little bun.</p><br/><p>Her attitude\u2026had changed entirely.</p><br/><p>Just a minute ago, she was still saying how miserable being a stepmother could be and how terrible a stepson might turn out.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put aside the candy and chocolate bar for the little bun, then gently returned the necklace and the pill. \"These are too valuable. Take it back, he doesn\u2019t have any use for them anyway.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re right...Lu Tingxiao\u2019s so rich\u2026\" Annie carefully took back her necklace, then she gave Ning Xi the red pill. \"Keep this, it\u2019s my latest invention. The contents can cure almost any poison! I\u2019ve tested it personally.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled. \"Then, I thank you on behalf on Little Treasure!\"</p><br/><p>\"Next time...if there\u2019s a next time, I\u2019ll prepare something better! I was in a haste this time, so I didn\u2019t expect to see Little Treasure as well!\" Annie said.</p><br/><p>Annie had totally forgotten about her rambling about being a miserable stepmother now. She could never mention it in front of such a cute creature!</p><br/><p>Such a cute child...no wonder Bro Xi liked him!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Annie sat back on the sofa with the little bun in between them. He was curiously studying the pill.</p><br/><p>\"This is unbelievable. How could Lu Tingxiao\u2019s son be this cute?\" Annie still could not get over it. \"Although he does look a little like him, this is so illogical\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Annie suddenly looked at Ning Xi. \"Bro Xi! Is this kid Lu Tingxiao's and yours?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched in amusement. \"My dear, you\u2019re overthinking this!\"</p><br/><p>Hmm? Father and Mother?</p><br/><p>The little bun had a wide smile on his face when he heard their conversation.</p><br/><p>\"Well\u2026\" Annie saw the little bun\u2019s smile and was suspicious. \"Actually, looking carefully, the both of you look very similar!\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? Which part?\" Ning Xi raised her eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Annie nodded. \"Yes, you do! Maybe you haven\u2019t noticed but when he smiled just now, he really looks like you! Especially the eyes!\"</p><br/><p>Annie suddenly thought of a key question. \"Um...who\u2019s the mother of this child?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged. \"I\u2019m not sure because Lu Tingxiao himself doesn\u2019t know either.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

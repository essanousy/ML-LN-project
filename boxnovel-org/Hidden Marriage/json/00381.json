However, more importantly, there was still the difficult Su Yimo to deal with...</p><br/><p>If she used Su Yimo as a weapon, she would be able to completely wipe Ning Xi out. If she offended the Lu group's higher authorities, she wouldn't last for too long.</p><br/><p>Before this, Su Yimo was egoistic and did not care about being calculative with Ning Xi, but after tonight, would she still let Ning Xi go?</p><br/><p>She just has to watch the cat fight happen then!</p><br/><p>Hah, Ning Xi, I will wait to watch you be defeated...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>After the launch of \"The World\", Ning Xi rested at home for three days. She lived like a pig - apart from practicing and eating, she just slept.</p><br/><p>Only on the third day, she finally felt like she had regained the other half of her soul that she had left with Meng Changge...</p><br/><p>However, in the next second, the sound of a message notification made her jump again.</p><br/><p>[Ning Xi, are you free tomorrow night? Xiao Bao's school registration is done. \u2014 Cabbage Lu]</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the words 'Cabbage Lu' and did not reply instantly.</p><br/><p>Even though she had survived the launching banquet, it did not mean that the danger had passed. In fact, it was a huge warning for her...</p><br/><p>That dude did not just want to tease her, he wanted to threaten and warn her.</p><br/><p>Warn her that even though he was miles away, he could still reach her...</p><br/><p>Ning Xi frowned, took out her phone, and retrieved a long-forgotten number from her telephone book.</p><br/><p>The phone only rang for a short while before it got through. Ning Xi was stunned for a second before she reacted in a rush, \"Hello, Annie...\"</p><br/><p>\"Hello! Bro Xi! It's really you! How long has it been since you contacted me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Be good now!\" When she heard the girl's emotional voice from the other end, Ning Xi's expression softened.</p><br/><p>\"Bro Xi, I really miss you! But before you left, you said you wanted to let go of the past and start a brand new life...so I daren't disturb you all this while...and daren't take the initiative to contact you...\" The girl on the other end of the phone sounded extremely sad.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed, \"Stupid child, I was just pretending to be cool! You really believed me?\"</p><br/><p>\"What?!\" Annie responded in a hurt tone, \"So my self-control over the urge to contact you all this while was for nothing?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was amused, \"Pfft, hahaha...I'm just teasing you! Why are you still so gullible?\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop teasing me! Bro Xi, you're too mean!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay, I'll stop fooling around now. It's time to talk business! I've called you this time to ask about something!\" Ning Xi said seriously.</p><br/><p>Annie quickly yet solemnly replied, \"What is it, Bro Xi? I'll tell you everything I know!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head then asked, \"It's...it's about your big boss. Has he been acting strangely recently?\"</p><br/><p>Annie was stunned and she stuttered, \"Uhh...this...well...\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi impatiently asked, \"What is it? Yes or no, it's such an easy question!\"</p><br/><p>Annie immediately answered, \"Bro Xi, yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?!\" Ning Xi suddenly sat up straight. \"How has he been acting weird? Tell me quickly!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

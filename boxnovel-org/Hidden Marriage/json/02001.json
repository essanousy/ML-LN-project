She pasted a bitter smile on her face and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I leave if I could make the decision? I\u2019ve been in Starlight for so long that it has become my second home. You\u2019re just like my sister. I wanted to stay in the company too, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Halfway through her sentence, Ning Xueluo suddenly sighed, the wry smile on her face worsening by the second.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The fact is that I\u2019ve left. Nothing else I say will change the situation, but now, because of me, you\u2019re affected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo stopped and looked at Han Zixuan oddly as if she had just said something she should not have.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan was not stupid. It was obvious that Ning Xueluo had something else to say and that it was related to her. She would never let this go, so she quickly held Ning Xueluo\u2019s hand tenderly. \u201cVice CEO Ning, what happened? You\u2019re the one who brought me up. Can\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo shook her head. \u201cZixuan, you\u2019re like my sister. There\u2019s no way I don\u2019t trust you. It\u2019s just that the times have changed. In the past, I could protect you no matter what happened, but now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you because I don\u2019t want to involve you. After all, I can\u2019t even protect myself now.\u201d</p><br/><p>What?!</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s words shocked Han Zixuan. Ning Xueluo was now the daughter-in-law of the Su family. With her position, who could pose a threat to her?</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, Ning Xi\u2019s face flashed through in Han Zixuan\u2019s mind. Was Ning Xi the reason for Ning Xueluo\u2019s retirement? Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan looked at Ning Xueluo in doubt. She hesitated for a while, then asked, \u201cIs it Ning Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s shoulders trembled when Han Zixuan mentioned the name Ning Xi. She lowered her head and put on an expression as if she had suffered a lot and was just surviving it.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi again?!</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan was determined that it was related to Ning Xi based on Ning Xueluo\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat witch messed with you? You were the top star back in the days. If it weren\u2019t for her, you\u2019d never have to quit. You\u2019re already out of the industry and she\u2019s still pestering you?! Just how shameless is she?!\u201d Han Zixuan responded angrily. She was not exactly sympathizing with Ning Xueluo; it just so happen that their common enemy was Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Her anger was real.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo observed Han Zixuan\u2019s reactions. Obviously, she knew what Han Zixuan was thinking about, but she did not show it. She looked up with a bitter smile and peered at Han ZIxuan with her helpless and lonely eyes as she patted her flat stomach with her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her fault. It\u2019s my own problem. I got pregnant some time ago. Su Yan is worried that I might be too tired, which is why he wanted me to leave Starlight and focus on the baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo hesitated with a lonely and forlorn vibe lying in her tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d Han Zixuan\u2019s eyes flew wide open. She quickly changed to a joyful tone. \u201cCongratulations, Vice CEO Ning is really blessed! CEO Su loves you so much and you\u2019re having his baby now. CEO Su must be treasuring you even more from now on. I\u2019m envious!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

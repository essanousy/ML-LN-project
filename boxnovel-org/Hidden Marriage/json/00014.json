One hand was covering his stomach and his face looked pale.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hurriedly went over, \u201cMister Lu, are you ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing big.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, does your stomach hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi knew that she had guessed right.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao actually couldn\u2019t eat spicy things. Yet why would he attempt to eat anyways?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a bit, I\u2019ll get you some stomach medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she had the most common medicines at home.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hurriedly brought over the stomach medicine, \u201cYou have to eat both pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Lu Tingxiao took the pills from her palm. His slightly cold fingers grazing lightly on her palm felt as if they were grazing the tip of her heart. It suddenly made her feel weak.</p><br/><p>In the still quiet of the windy and stormy night, it was too easy to lose control with this kind of beauty in front of her!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi silently chanted the digits of Pi until she could calm her heart down.</p><br/><p>Looking at Lu Tingxiao eating the medicine, she accompanied him for a while since it wasn\u2019t polite to leave immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a little better now? Do you need to go to the hospital? I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t eat spicy foods\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally she was worried about little bun. In the end nothing happened to little bun, but something happened to Lu Tingxiao instead! What would this be called\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNot your fault, it\u2019s just an old problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao suddenly opened his mouth after the two were silent for a bit: \u201cThe reason for intruding on your hospitality tonight was because Little Treasure wanted to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d made a slip of the tongue, \u201cLittle Treasure wanted to see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure had suffered a big fright in the warehouse. He\u2019s very reliant on you now since you saved him.\u201d Lu Tingxiao explained.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi found that as long as Little Treasure was nearby, or if someone brought up questions regarding Little Treasure, the piercing cold atmosphere around Lu Tingxiao would weaken a lot. He wasn\u2019t as scary as was earlier during daytime.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like this\u2026\u2026\u201dNing Xi nodded her head.</p><br/><p>This kind of night was easy to cause people to let down their defenses and reservations. Ning Xi asked a question that had been bothering her for a while, \u201cUmm, taking the liberty to ask. Does Little Treasure not know how to speak?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even up until today, she had never heard Little Treasure utter a single word. The little fellow would only nod or shake his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore so than not knowing how to talk, he doesn\u2019t want to talk.\u201d Lu Tingxiao answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a problem of the heart?\u201d Ning Xi frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure is a bit closed off. He tends to shut himself away.\u201d Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t hide anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was pretty much what she had guessed.</p><br/><p>As to why Little Treasure would shut himself away, this kind of rich family\u2019s secret, she naturally would not dare to ask about more deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning.\u201d Lu Tingxiao suddenly focused his gaze on her. Those eyes were bright, cold and calm. Yet it gave her a feeling of being so fiery that it would burn a body into ashes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Ning Xi gave a slight start at the gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave we met somewhere before?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>If these words were spoken by someone else, Ning Xi would definitely think the other side was trying to strike up a conversation. Using an obsolete/old way at that too. But the person speaking was Lu Tingxiao, the bewilderment in his eyes were real.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe probably haven\u2019t. Even if I had seen Mr. Lu before, there\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t have an impression\u2026but is there some problem?\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s tone was still considered firm. With her status, she couldn\u2019t have met a person at Lu Tingxiao\u2019s level. That would be the case even when she was still the Ning family\u2019s young miss.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Lu Tingxiao shifted his gaze, his eyes reflecting the deep color of the night outside the window. He seemed a bit lonely.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere seemed to be going a little bad as they continued to interact like this!</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Lu, if you don\u2019t have anything else, then I\u2019ll go to sleep first?\u201d Ning Xi carefully said.</p><br/><p>It seemed as if Lu Tingxiao had seen through her. He raised his hand, \u201cNo hurries, sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not in a hurry?! She was in a very big hurry, ok!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But he was rude and tried to push his own beliefs of what happened on her\u2026</p><br/><p>Filled with the day in the hospital, when she faced Ning uncle and Ning Aunt\u2019s accusations, her clear eyes full of sadness, stubbornly refusing to bow down to their words\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Filled with the day when he said those wounding words and accusations\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After that incident, he immediately stood at Ning Xuelo\u2019s side, never thinking to listen to her explanation.</p><br/><p>Even when they broke up and he wanted to marry her sister, instead of protecting her he has always been doing things to hurt her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo has him, her parents\u2019 love, a supportive agency, and fans\u2026</p><br/><p>But she has been wronged all over the world, burdened with abuse, and endured the grievances and accusations of others.</p><br/><p>In the end, the person who is actually concerned about her, and not just claiming to be in a stance of hypocritical justice is a complete stranger.</p><br/><p>Through a glass window, he watched an LED screen outside the shopping center.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had a serious expression. Word by word, she answered the reporter\u2019s question: \u201cI want to work hard and help the boss make more money, in return for helping with my career. To prove that he did not make the wrong choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that this is not a formal answer, but one from her heart. She has such a temper, but as long as people do good to her, she will do her best to repay them.</p><br/><p>His heart was pounding so much, he could hardly breathe\u2026he always thought that she had changed, when in fact, the person who changed was him.</p><br/><p>His mind kept on wandering back to the memories of that day through the ward window, watching her all alone in the courtyard\u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking of that thin, hopeless back\u2026\u2026his heart felt as if stabbed by a knife\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At night in VIVI bar. This is a very small bar, in a remote location but it\u2019s quite stylish. Its well known in the entertainment business, and since their privacy is very good, many people come to relax at this place.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi has been sitting in a booth when Jiang Muye arrives. She was sitting cross legged on the sofa, and the coffee table has several empty bottles.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took off his mask and sunglasses.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Hey, you didn\u2019t wait for me and started drinking on your own?\u201d Jiang Muye cried out. \u201cDidn\u2019t you stop drinking? I also do not want you to drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged, \u201cWell, when I did, you started drinking. Have you gotten me some juice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ass! Go get your own juice from the bar!\u201d Jiang Muye snapped and glared at her.</p><br/><p>So Ning Xi rang the bell to call the waiter. A handsome little brother came in and asked with a smile: \u201cMiss, what would you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took out a big bill and stuffed it into his pocket, \u201cLittle brother, help big sister to buy two bottles of juice yeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter froze for a moment, his cheeks red, then he laughed: \u201cI am at your service.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Jiang Muye is staring so much his eyeballs almost pop out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi! You need to stop! Don\u2019t you see how he\u2019s looking at you because you teased him?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi casually stretched her legs out and kicked him: \u201cMind your own business. I just teased him. It is nothing. Your dirty mind only sees what is dirty.</p><br/><p>J</p><br/><p>iang Muye pats his pants, some dirt coming off. \u201cDon\u2019t you talk to me about something others did. That\u2019s not the point!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it you that started it first?\u201d Ning replied, then leaned back on the sofa and sighed. After a long day, it is no longer possible to cover up her fatigue and it showed on her face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

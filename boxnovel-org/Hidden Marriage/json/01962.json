Ning Xi dared not even imagine what had happened.</p><br/><p>Initially, she thought that Han Xiao was severely injured, yet she realized that he could still speak like this, so she let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Master, your chest is still bleeding\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli pointed to Han Xiao\u2019s chest and said in shock.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned her attention to his chest for a moment and was terrified. It was obviously an injury by a cold weapon. Considering his bruise, it should have been a dagger that almost pierced through his heart.</p><br/><p>With such a severe injury, if it were just anyone else, without being sent to the hospital for a surgery in time, they would definitely be dead without a doubt.</p><br/><p>However, Han Xiao could still speak so relaxed and indifferently right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t puncture my fatal point. It\u2019s just loss of some nutrients,\u201d said Han Xiao casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already like this and still trying to be cool. If you\u2019re alright, would you have lost consciousness on the back of a tiger?\u201d Ning Xi frowned.</p><br/><p>Initially, Lu Jingli wanted to ask how the white tiger had brought Han Xiao over, but before he could, an elderly man in a tuxedo had knocked and entered.</p><br/><p>This elderly man was the private doctor that Lu Tingxiao called over.</p><br/><p>Upon entering, the elderly man saw Han Xiao and quickly half-knelt on the ground to check Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Lu, is this the wounded person that you mentioned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lost too much blood. His wound is very deep. It\u2019s very close to his heart\u2026\u201d The more the elderly man checked Han Xiao thoroughly, the more fear bubbled within him.</p><br/><p>Forget the rest. The wound was caused by an extremely sharp weapon. Had it been anyone else, they would have died from the pain. Furthermore, with the huge loss of blood, if it was not treated in time, they would probably not be able to hold on much longer and have passed away.</p><br/><p>While this young man\u2019s expression was calm, he seemed careless about his injuries. Unfortunately, he did not have his instruments. Otherwise, he would check how strong this person\u2019s physique was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeird\u2026 He looks like the issue isn\u2019t huge, but this wound\u2026\u201d The elderly man seemed puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSterilize the wound, then sew it up,\u201d said Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, you need to get to the hospital. I can\u2019t handle this here,\u201d reminded the elderly man.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Han Xiao was indifferent. To him, he was the best doctor himself as he was familiar with his own body.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Lu, what do you think?\u201d The elderly man\u2019s gaze fell on Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>This person seemed to be Lu Tingxiao\u2019s friend. If any mishap happened, he could not bear the burden.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asking you to sterilize it and stitch it up. Just do as he said,\u201d Ning Xi instructed quickly.</p><br/><p>No matter what, she still sub-consciously chose to trust Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo as he says,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Okay\u2026\u201d Helplessly, the elderly man could only do as Han Xiao said. He cleaned and sterilized the wound, then sewed it up.</p><br/><p>After he stitched Han Xiao\u2019s wound up, the elderly man stood up and borrowed the bathroom to clean his things. Then, having advised the patient on a few things, he left.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao brought Han Xiao a set of clothes. After he changed into them, Ning Xi asked, \u201cHan Xiao, what actually happened? How did you get injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was hit by someone.\u201d Han Xiao looked apathetic.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were hit? to this extent?\u201d Ning Xi looked flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was very clear about what kind of a madman was before her. How could a monster that could even evade bullets could be beaten up to this extent?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI was almost beaten to death. Lucky thing I\u2019m vigilant enough. Otherwise, the dagger would\u2019ve pierced my heart\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though it was horrifying, seeing Han Xiao\u2019s \u201ccome at me with a few more daggers\u201d expression made her want to beat him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, is this guy really human?\u201d Lu Jingli\u2019s mouth twitched in annoyance.</p><br/><p>He had almost been pierced through the heart by a dagger, yet he looked just dandy right now after just being stitched up.</p><br/><p>Just like Ning Xi had described him, he was super abnormal.</p></div>\n</div>"}

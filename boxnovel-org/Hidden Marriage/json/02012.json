Everyone was over-friendly and passionately making small talk with her.</p><br/><p>After all, everyone knew that once Ning Xi went down, the entertainment industry would be under Han Zixuan\u2019s rule again.</p><br/><p>\u201cZixuan, what you\u2019ve done this time is so satisfying for everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve long thought that Ning Xi wasn\u2019t a decent person, but I never would\u2019ve thought that she\u2019d be even more disgusting than we thought!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Zixuan coming out to uphold justice, we don\u2019t know how long would we have been deceived by her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan was surrounded by everyone speaking all at once. Facing the crowd\u2019s praises, she said with an expression that feigned nobility, \u201cDifferent people have different aspirations. In order to climb up the ladder, some people will do just anything. However, no matter what the others do, it has nothing to do with me. I have my own principles and my own bottom line.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZixuan, how can someone like that be compared to you? She relies on such dirty tricks to rise up; even if she climbed up high, no one would respect her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe entertainment industry is ruined by such people!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a small artiste glanced around and said excitedly, \u201cOh, I heard that for today\u2019s charity banquet, Ning Xi is on the invitation list too. Why haven\u2019t I seen her?\u201d</p><br/><p>The others immediately sneered, \u201cSuch a scandal has already come out. How would she dare to appear? Isn\u2019t she afraid that she\u2019d drown to death from everyone\u2019s saliva spitting at her?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s definitely hiding at home and daren\u2019t meet anyone! Besides, today our Zixuan is here too. Wouldn\u2019t she hide far, far away?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The crowd was ridiculing her back and forth, then suddenly there was a clamor from the entrance of the banquet hall.</p><br/><p>Everyone slowly looked towards the direction of the entrance. In the next second, a stunning silhouette appeared under the flashing lights of the media.</p><br/><p>When the crowd surrounding Han Zixuan had a clearer look at the figure, they could not help but gasp.</p><br/><p>They saw Ning Xi standing alone on the red carpet in a black gown. Her flawless face attracted everyone present, and numerous cameras were fixed on her at this moment, greedily catching her alluring manner between her every little move.</p><br/><p>The pure black dress complimented her face which was beyond breathtaking akin to the dark night sky complimenting thousands of stars. It was dazzling.</p><br/><p>Beyond everyone\u2019s expectations, not only was Ning Xi not absent, she had even arrived punctually. She was not even in dire straits or as wan and sallow as they had imagined. Once she stepped onto the red carpet, she instantly wiped out all of the female artistes who were present.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan looked at all the reporters shooting Ning Xi\u2019s pictures like crazy and saw that on the red carpet, Ning Xi appeared radiant as always. Her eyes were filled with intense jealousy.</p><br/><p>The female artistes around Han Zixuan only returned to their senses after a while. Apart from shock, all of their eyes were also filled with envy similar to Han Zixuan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing\u2026 that\u2019s actually Ning Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God! It really is her! She actually has the dignity to come! If it was me, I would just kill myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSluts are just that shameless! Is there anything she won\u2019t do?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Han Zixuan listened to all the ridicule around her and when she thought about how Ning Xi would end up from then on, she calmed herself down again. She quietly watched Ning Xi enter and was immediately surrounded by a group of frenzied reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning Xi, regarding the expos\u00e8 about you online recently, is there anything you\u2019d like to clarify?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning Xueluo said that you\u2019ve been admiring Mr. Su, and hopelessly muddled with him. Is this true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe video of you and Mr. Su\u2019s late-night tryst, is that true? Did you really get in between Mr. Su and Miss Ning Xueluo\u2019s marriage?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

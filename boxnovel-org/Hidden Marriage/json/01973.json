Would you feel pressured by challenging such an important role?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it my best shot. Of course, there\u2019ll be some pressure, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi was replying, Jiang Muye was entering with his manager and assistant.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glared at him when she saw that he had arrived. This kid was actually late for this important event today!</p><br/><p>A lot of cameras were facing him following his sudden appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, really sorry. The car broke down halfway.\u201d Lei Ming bowed his head in apology. He would never admit that this guy was too excited and had overslept!</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye went up to Simon Joseph and said, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Director Simon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a seat.\u201d Simon Joseph waved his hand.</p><br/><p>After Jiang Muye had received the contract from Ning Xi, he had gone to the producer\u2019s team and met Jace. He had also familiarized himself with the rest of the crew.</p><br/><p>He was usually not serious, but once he got fired up, it was hard for people to dislike him. Very soon, he was getting along with the crew.</p><br/><p>When people saw Jiang Muye take a seat at the chair with the card \u201cCarl\u201d in front, some people screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Is Jiang Muye acting as Carl?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough Carl doesn\u2019t have that many scenes, his popularity is not any lesser than the main lead\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The artiste, who played the cross-dressing assassin Carl, had now became an international star.</p><br/><p>He was currently one of the highest paid comedians in Hollywood.</p><br/><p>Lei Ming looked around, then he went up to Xu Tao and smiled. \u201cThanks to Ning Xi. She gave Muye such a big chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao chirped happily, \u201cMy queen is the best, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Hollywood had selected three Chinese actors. Even if Han Zixuan\u2019s minor role was not included, Ning Xi and Jiang Muye as the main lead of the movie and the other being an outstanding secondary character was simply unimaginable.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Mr. Jiang Muye, I\u2019ve never heard about you going for the audition! How did you get this role?\u201d A certain female reporter looked at Jiang Muye with doubt.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye nodded and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t go for the audition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d the female reporter asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi helped me get it,\u201d Jiang Muye told the truth.</p><br/><p>It was not just the female reporter who asked, everyone else who heard Jiang Muye\u2019s reply were surprised.</p><br/><p>What? / update by </p><br/><p>Ning Xi helped him get it? What did he mean?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone looked at Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just made a recommendation. It\u2019s mainly Senior Jiang\u2019s own capability.\u201d Ning Xi beamed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was annoyed when he heard Ning Xi\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>Capability to cross-dress?!</p><br/><p>This person was hiding her true words!</p><br/><p>The members of the media once again fell into silence.</p><br/><p>All along, they had been comparing Han Zixuan to Ning Xi. By the looks of things now, it was nothing but a joke.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ning Xi, you\u2019ve really become famous. Everyone knows your name now! Hehe, and they know of all the scandalous things you\u2019ve done! You\u2019re so shameless, you actually dared to come back on set after creating a situation like this!\u201d Jia Qingqing gloated at Ning Xi\u2019s misfortune.</p><br/><p>As long as Ning Xi was forced out of the production, she would be able to take Ning Xi\u2019s place and act with Muye-gege!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi bit her lip, her body trembling, as she remained silent with a pitiful expression.</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing was even more pleased with herself when she saw Ning Xi\u2019s appearance. She neared Jiang Muye and spoke coyly, \u201cMuye-gege, you should stay further away from people like her! Otherwise, she will ruin your reputation! You\u2019ve already starting to lose fans thanks to her!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jia Qingqing approached, a strong smell of perfume immediately floated over. Veins bulged on Jiang Muye\u2019s forehead. He wanted to flare up on the spot, but after remembering Ning Xi\u2019s warning, he took a deep breath and forced himself to endure.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Jiang Muye had ignored her, Jia Qingqing assumed that getting involved in a situation like this had put him in a bad mood. She comforted him considerately, \u201cMuye-gege, you can rest assured. The production crew will give in to the pressure and replace Ning Xi sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so noisy.\u201d Jiang Muye had to completely exhaust his self-control in order to hold back all of his curses and spit out those three words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Muye-gege, I won\u2019t disturb your rest anymore.\u201d Jia Qingqing left, looking rather wronged.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t happy about how Jiang Muye still treated her as coldly as ever, but after some thought, she quickly got over it. In any case, when she became the second female lead, she would have plenty of opportunities to interact with Muye-gege.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but feel excited, thinking about those intimate scenes.</p><br/><p>On another note, why had the director asked her to continue filming scenes with Ning Xi? This was such a waste of time!</p><br/><p>However, she did quite like the scenes they were filming today. One of them was a scene where she got to slap Ning Xi on the face.</p><br/><p>Hmph, when the time came, she would make sure Ning Xi was humiliated!</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, I think that for this scene, the result will be better if I really slap her. What do you think?\u201d Jia Qingqing, who had never been conscientious about filming before, took the rare initiative to discuss the scene with the director.</p><br/><p>How could Guo Qisheng not know what she was thinking? He spoke seriously, \u201cThe main point is to use the camera angles. At most, it\u2019s enough to touch the face a little!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Jia Qingqing agreed verbally, but had absolutely no plans of obeying. She decided to do a real slap, and to slap a couple more times at that to let that slut suffer some more.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as if this was the first time she had taken revenge through her work, and she had been successful every time.</p><br/><p>After everyone had finished preparing, the filming began.</p><br/><p>In this scene, Meng Changge had just entered the palace under the alias Nan Wumeng. She was still only a small little palace maid, but because the emperor had given her a second glance, Concubine Xian became jealous and called her to the Qin Palace to give her a hard time.</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless slut, you actually dared to seduce the Emperor right under my nose?\u201d Concubine Xian stopped talking and threw a slap.</p><br/><p>The moment Jia Qingqing made a move, Ning Xi narrowed her eyes and leaned slightly to the side, cleverly evading the camera and dodging Jia Qingqing\u2019s hand. However, on the surface she appeared to have received an forceful hit and her entire person was thrown miserably onto the ground. Afterwards, she turned her face to the side and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2014\u2014\u201d Gu Qisheng jumped up in surprise. All the other production crew members who were watching also suffered a shock and gathered around her one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cJia Qingqing, is this your first day filming? You can\u2019t even control your own strength?\u201d Guo Qisheng was usually very even tempered, but this time, he had really lost his temper.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t interfere in matters that took place outside of filming, but he absolutely would not put up with despicable acts like this during on his set!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jia Qingqing had gotten scared herself. She had deliberately used some force earlier, but it definitely wasn\u2019t enough to throw Ning Xi to the ground and cause her to spit up blood. Not only that, she had clearly sensed that Ning Xi had dodged just now. Simply put, she hadn\u2019t even touched Ning Xi. Thus, she cried out in protest and disbelief, \u201cI only slapped her lightly, I hardly used any force! She\u2019s putting on an act!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She dove into a cubicle and opened a large, black duffel bag. She pulled out her tools and started to put on makeup.</p><br/><p>When she came out from the washroom, Ning Xi had already turned into a white-haired old lady.</p><br/><p>The ringtone for a text message notification sounded on her phone.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pulled out her phone to look, and it was indeed from Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: Ning Xi! I\u2019m giving you 5 minutes to appear in front of me, or I\u2019m going to announce our relationship!</p><br/><p>Damnit!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi checked her makeup for one last time, then hurriedly ran to the most packed area of the crowd.</p><br/><p>She put on an expression of helplessness and anxiety and coughed twice, \u201cPlease let me pass, excuse me\u2026 My dear kind girls, could you let this old lady look at Ah Ye?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Don\u2019t push! There\u2019s a very old lady here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, grandmother, why do you want to see our Muye? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re Muye\u2019s fan too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my goodness! Our Muye attracts young and old! He even has a grandmother fan! Everyone, quick, let this grandmother pass!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, how old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stooped over and beat on the small of her back, thanking them continuously, \u201cDear girls, thank you, thank you all. I\u2019m already 80. I like this little fellow a lot, because he looks especially like my grandson! My grandson is currently working in a place very far away, I only get to see him a few times a year\u2026\u201d After saying so, she started to wipe away tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuye! Muye! You have a grandmother fan here! Please meet her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, please meet her at least once! She\u2019s quite pitiful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With the enthusiastic support from the fans, Ning Xi was quickly pushed to the front.</p><br/><p>At the center of the crowd, Jiang Muye used his fingers to comb back his unruly blond hair. He took off his sunglasses and a trace of suspicion flashed across his handsome face, \u201cA grandmother fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes! She\u2019s almost 80! She came specially to the airport on such a hot day just to meet you! She said she really likes you because you look like her grandson, who\u2019s working overseas!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the fans finished speaking, Jiang Muye followed the path that the crowd had opened up, and spotted a wrinkled old lady wearing tatty coarse clothes, holding onto a cane.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s expression instantly became extremely warped, \u201cThe f\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He used the last of his reason to hold back the rest of the curse, and glared at that \u2018old lady\u2019 as if he wanted to strangle her to death.</p><br/><p>Of course, this all happened within a second, so the fans didn\u2019t detect his abnormality.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 my grandson\u2026 my good grandson\u2026 Grandma misses you so much\u2026\u201d Ning Xi fell onto Jiang Muye with a sudden stride forward. She ruffled his hair messily, crying like she had a broken heart.</p><br/><p>Everyone at the scene watched this warm and touching moment, and they followed along crying like the rain. The media\u2019s shutter sounds also fired off constantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi! You just wait till tonight!\u201d Jiang Muye gritted his teeth as he whispered into her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my grandson, my dear grandson! Why have you become so thin! Grandma\u2019s heart hurts for you!\u201d Ning Xi was really into the act, the hair that Jiang Muye was most vain about had already been ruffled into a bird\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Jiang Muye was close to letting go of his anger and was about to explode, his manager, Lei Ming, came out to help him out of trouble, \u201cUh, everyone, please give way. This grandmother got a little too emotional and her body seems rather weak, so we\u2019re going to help send her home!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye kept up a warm and caring expression, but pinched a certain someone\u2019s hand viciously in secret, and quickly left the airport.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her surroundings were bustling with noise and clamour, but it seemed as if she was living in a world of her own.</p><br/><p>The strong alcohol slipped past her dark red lips and slid down her elegant, slender neck, rolling down the collar of her clothes and inviting wild thoughts\u2026</p><br/><p>That scene was extremely beautiful, causing all the men present to stare fixedly.</p><br/><p>The cameraman intentionally pushed the camera nearer for a close up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe storm envelops the river, rain darkens the village, the four mountains sound like ocean waves\u2026\u201d Ning Xi read the poem out loud in a haze of intoxication, while standing up shakily.</p><br/><p>In the next second, she tossed the wine goblet away with a clatter. With messy steps, she began to dance, \u201cThe fire burns soft and warm, my cat and I are unable to leave the house\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That slender waist was like a willow branch, bending to its limit before fiercely springing back up. A light gauze fluttered along with her movements, her gaze turned charming and coquettish.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbed, motionless, in a lonely village,</p><br/><p>For myself I sorrow not.</p><br/><p>All I seek\u2019s defence of my country\u2019s frontier,</p><br/><p>And to me a station there allot\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She picked up the wine pot on the table and took a gulp.</p><br/><p>Those dazzling movements could be called a dance, but it seemed even more like a war dance for the battlefields. From a bewitching fairy into a general who had led armies into campaigns, the difference was breathtakingly stunning.</p><br/><p>Consort De\u2019s true identity was the female general Meng Changge. The Meng family had gone on war expedition after war expedition for the sake of the country, but it had resulted in the execution of all of her family members, leaving her alone. She had entered the palace, not just to kill her enemies, but to topple this kingdom further\u2026</p><br/><p>Close by, the emperor didn\u2019t seem to have noticed the danger. He was entranced by the beauty of the scene. Holding a wine goblet, he couldn\u2019t react for a long time, he was totally drawn in.</p><br/><p>Seeing the wild infatuation rekindled in the emperor\u2019s eyes, Consort Xian and the new concubines were full of jealousy and resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLying in the depth of the night I listen</p><br/><p>To the winds blowing the rain,</p><br/><p>And iron-clad horses o\u2019er frozen rivers,</p><br/><p>As of old, invade my dreams again\u2026</p><br/><p>As of old, invade my dreams again\u2026</p><br/><p>As of old, invade my dreams again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spoke the last line three times: the first time absent-mindedly, the second time with sorrow, and the last time was filled with clear resolution.</p><br/><p>Once she finished speaking, she leaned into the emperor\u2019s embrace alluringly, bewitching the ruler of the country, determined to continue on her path of revenge\u2026</p><br/><p>When the scene came to an end, the director almost forgot to shout cut.</p><br/><p>\u201cCut! That was great!\u201d Guo Qisheng was the first to applaud, \u201cNing Xi\u2019s dance was good, very professional. The hardest part was conveying everything I wanted, everyone\u2019s expressions were good as well. Old Feng, I don\u2019t need to mention you, but the rare one was Qingqing, that expression was extremely on point!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing\u2019s expression was as dark as the bottom of a wok. How could it be off point? That was real jealousy and hatred there.</p><br/><p>The actor playing the emperor, Feng Yibo, was an experienced actor who specialised in playing the emperor. He had acted alongside countless beauties, and at this moment, he couldn\u2019t resist smiling, \u201cDirector Guo, I was stunned for real there, I wasn\u2019t acting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you earlier that my junior\u2019s skill isn\u2019t ordinary!\u201d Ning Xueluo, who had been watching from the side, gave her praise as well. However, in actuality, she was about to grind her teeth into powder.</p><br/><p>Once they finished filming for the day, Ning Xueluo pulled her assistant to a side for interrogation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? It\u2019s been an entire afternoon and she hasn\u2019t had any reaction at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant showed panic in her expression, \u201cI poured it in myself, and I even put a bit of it in all the makeup: blush, eyeshadow, highlighter\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s a late reaction?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo glared at her, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible, the moment she touches something like that, she should start having red spots within half an hour!\u201d That was how she had made Ning Xi look bad at a birthday banquet previously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen maybe she didn\u2019t use those products\u2026\u201d The assistant said weakly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUseless! Why didn\u2019t you do something to her clothes as well, just in case?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think of it back then. Xueluo-jie, please don\u2019t be angry, I won\u2019t make such a mistake the next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo suppressed her anger. It was just an unexpected mishap this time. There were so many opportunities ahead. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t need to make a move herself, the look in Jia Qingqing\u2019s eyes when she looked at Ning Xi earlier revealed how much hatred she bore for her.</p><br/><p>Heh, Ning Xi, did you think that you could rest easy in this role?</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll push you up higher so you will fall even harder!</p><br/><p>TL Note:</p><br/><p>The poems that Ning Xi read are called by Lu You.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The first poem:</p><br/><p>???????????????</p><br/><p>???????????????</p><br/><p>The storm envelops the river, rain darkens the village,</p><br/><p>the four mountains sound like ocean waves,</p><br/><p>The fire burns soft and warm,</p><br/><p>my cat and I won\u2019t leave the house.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>It talks about a storm raging in a village, being warm and cosy at home and not wanting to leave the house. (So relatable &gt;u&gt;)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t find an official translation for this, so I tried to translate to the best of my ability. ovo;;</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The second poem:</p><br/><p>???????????????</p><br/><p>???????????????</p><br/><p>Abed, motionless, in a lonely village,</p><br/><p>For myself I sorrow not.</p><br/><p>All I seek\u2019s defence of my country\u2019s frontier,</p><br/><p>And to me a station there allot.</p><br/><p>Lying in the depth of the night I listen</p><br/><p>To the winds blowing the rain,</p><br/><p>And iron-clad horses o\u2019er frozen rivers,</p><br/><p>As of old, invade my dreams again.</p><br/><p>This pretty translation was written by Wang Zhihuan! (Source: http://www.en84.com/dianji/shi/200912/00000398.html)</p><br/><p>It talks about patriotism, which is why Meng Changge was so emotional while reading it. Her family was loyal to the country, and she was surely raised to be patriotic too, but now she\u2019s on the path to destroying the country for revenge\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

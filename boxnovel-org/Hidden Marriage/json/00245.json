You rock!</p><br/><p>I made my first \u2018Adult\u2019 decision yesterday and bought a car so I\u2019ve been really busy :).</p><br/><p>We owe our readers 6 extra chapters and once I finish all the paperwork and DMV visits required for the car, I will get right on translating with Akari.</p><br/><p>Look forward to extreme cuteness from LTX and Nxi!!</p><br/><p>Translator: Awesome Akari, Blaze</p><br/><p>Editor: cfadmode who is always killing it \ud83d\ude42</p><br/><p>Looking at the large bouquet of lilies, Ning Xi gawked as she blinked, and accepted the bouquet out of conditioned reflex.</p><br/><p>Then, the waiters filed into the room, spread the tablecloth, place the candlestick and laid the table. In just five minutes, an exquisite candle light dinner was set up. The waiters then bowed in unison and left the room.</p><br/><p>So, this was what Lu Ting Xiao meant when he asked if they could dine here\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She even thought he meant cooking at home!</p><br/><p>She was too naive!!!</p><br/><p>Just now, on one of the waiter\u2019s uniform, she saw the word \u2018Red Restaurant\u2019 imprinted on it. Red Restaurant is the most famous private restaurant in B city\u2019s aristocratic circle. It is known for cooking only one table of food a day, and for those who people who wants to order, they have to line up and wait till next year.</p><br/><p>This restaurant had a rule, they do not take specific orders, they cook at their own will and you have to eat them regardless of your preference. To think that Lu Ting Xiao could actually make such a willful restaurant personally send takeaway to her house\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the flowers, looked at the table and the candlelit dinner\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u2026this is clearly the setting for a confession, right?\u201d Ning Xi quietly whispered to herself.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao deliberately sent Little Treasure away today, arranged this in advance, and even asked the question of how to pursue a girl\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Is he really going to do it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Why is she feeling more and more panicked?</p><br/><p>The next second, her eyes glanced down at the small dessert on the table. Uh there should not be any wedding ring hidden in the cake or something right, cough cough\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s impossible, definitely impossible. With Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s personality, how could he do something that would be so easy to guess!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like the food?\u201d Seeing that her expression wasn\u2019t good, Lu Ting Xiao frowned slightly. Then he picked up the phone, \u201cI\u2019ll ask them to change the dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly waved, \u201cNo, it is not needed! They are all the food that I like to eat! I mean\u2026\u2026the dinner should be on me, how did it became the other way round?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao shrugged, then he pulled the chair out for her like a gentleman.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, thank you\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi had no choice but to sit down.</p><br/><p>She carefully observed Lu Ting Xiao and found something peculiar.</p><br/><p>Today was a day of rest, so he should be wearing casual clothing. However, he was formally dressed today, and he even had a bow tie, which was extremely rare!</p><br/><p>After sitting down, Ning Xi found herself feeling absent-minded. She actually forgot that she was still holding the flowers, hence she rushed to find a vase to put them into.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you like them?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ning Xi froze for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLilies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yes I really like them\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I think lilies are right for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he referring to the fact that lilies stand for \u2018purity\u2019 or the fact that lilies represent \u2018a hundred good years together\u2019?</p><br/><p>(T/N Akari: funfact-  is the chinese name of the lily flower, which also directly translates to hundred [], together [].)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us eat.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao said, while passing her a pair of chopsticks.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, en\u2026\u2026I will do just that!\u201d To cover up the tension, Ning Xi began to bury her head and eat.</p><br/><p>When she ate until her stomach felt bloated, she finally found out that something is wrong. In one of her hand was a slice of half-eaten cake, and her brows furrowed as she looked at the man across her\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao had not eaten much. Instead, he opened a bottle of wine and start drinking by himself. He been drinking without discretion, and soon the bottle was almost empty\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Ting Xiao, how can you just be drinking wine, and you even drank so much! Also, I did not see you touching the food much, uh\u2026\u2026pff\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was still speaking as she took a bite of the cake. Her teeth suddenly bit something hard and she hurriedly spit it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cF***, what the hell is this, my teeth have become numb\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding-\u2019 a sparkling ring\u2026\u2026fell onto the white porcelain plate in front of her\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

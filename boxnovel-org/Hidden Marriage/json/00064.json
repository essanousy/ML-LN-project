While humming, he brought out a bottle of good wine from his wine cellar.</p><br/><p>When all preparations were done, he sat cross-legged on the floor and just as he was rolling up his sleeves and preparing to try out the game, the doorbell outside rang.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s face immediately darkened, but he didn\u2019t open the door. With a fiery temper, he called Lei Ming, \u201cStop ringing! I\u2019ll get there on time tomorrow, okay? You keep calling me back and forth like some animal, I can\u2019t even play a game, do you believe that I\u2019ll just quit right now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? What ringing are you talking about?\u201d After getting shouted at for a long while, Lei Ming was utterly confused.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye immediately choked on his rant, \u201cYou\u2019re not the one outside ringing my doorbell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already far away. In fact, I\u2019m still driving!\u201d Lei Ming was completely innocent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who could it be\u2026 Not many people know that I live here\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye mumbled suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be that your address has been leaked? Be careful, don\u2019t open the door recklessly, what if it\u2019s the media! Ning Xi is still over there!\u201d Lei Ming immediately warned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye scoffed and replied without a care, \u201cSo what if it\u2019s the media! What\u2019s going to happen even if they see her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei Ming was helpless, \u201cMuye, I\u2019m not trying to lecture you. Even if you\u2019re trying to help her out of good intentions, the other party has to accept it! Ning Xi has already said she doesn\u2019t want to get on your pirate ship\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye immediately flared up, \u201cWhat pirate ship! Who are you calling a pirate ship!\u201d</p><br/><p>The doorbell continued ringing. It rang once every five seconds, following a strict pattern.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking to you anymore, I\u2019m going to open the door! Who could be visiting me at this late hour\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye hung up and walked towards the living room impatiently.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye specially looked at the CCTV to check who it was outside. The result: he was struck dumb and looked as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god! It\u2019s Lu Tingxiao!!! Why is he here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the main entrance, the man was wearing grey casual clothes and slippers holding something in his hands. Although he was dressed so casually, Jiang Muye could somehow feel a cold wind blowing from the tundra onto the back of his neck. It even sent shivers up his spine.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was so panicked that he felt like running around in circles, like a bunny that had seen a wolf. It was only when the doorbell rang two more times that he took a deep breath and opened the door.</p><br/><p>In the instant the door opened, the sloppy attitude from before had completely changed into a cautiously respectful manner, \u201cUh, how come you\u2019re here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to see you.\u201d The man replied expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 please come in! Come in\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye quickly invited him in.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s gaze casually swept over the game controllers on the floor, snacks and wine, then sat on the sofa.</p><br/><p>Noticing Lu Tingxiao\u2019s line of sight, Jiang Muye coughed lightly and explained, \u201cUh, this job\u2019s too tiring, it\u2019s rare to get a break to relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao wasn\u2019t bothered by this. He spoke up, \u201cWhen did you arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot too long ago.\u201d Jiang Muye rummaged about for a long while before finally finding a teabag. However, he didn\u2019t have any hot water, so he could only pick up a bottle of mineral water from the fridge, \u201cI don\u2019t have any hot water at home yet, is this okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I\u2019ll just sit for a while before I go.\u201d Lu Tingxiao pointed at the few boxes he had brought over, \u201cYour mother sent these.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just send someone to bring it over to me, there\u2019s no need to trouble you to come personally so late at night!\u201d Jiang Muye grumbled at his own dear mother a hundred times in his heart. Why send him over! Didn\u2019t she know that he feared this person the most? Fine, there was no need to think, his mother had definitely sent this person to check up on him while clearly knowing that\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s just that one line. I\u2019ve already memorised it just watching them! You\u2019re Meng Changge? How could you be Meng Changge! Meng Changge has already died! It\u2019s just that one line, is it really that hard to memorise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat post even said that Ning Xi\u2019s acting was terrible. He really should take a look at Jia Qingqing, so he finally finds out what\u2019s really dog shit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, Ning Xi is quite good at acting. Didn\u2019t you notice that she has always gotten through scenes in a single take? Even if the scene gets ruined, it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, that seems to be true! I thought that she got into acting because of her looks, but she looked amazing when she was acting the young Meng Changge yesterday! Although she was teasing Jiang Muye all the way, I don\u2019t know why, but it didn\u2019t give me a bad feeling. Conversely, I felt my heart fluttering just watching them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! I got so excited watching them yesterday! I wouldn\u2019t like it as much if they changed the actor! It feels like Ning Xi is Meng Changge in my heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo hadn\u2019t expected that an even worse situation would appear. Instantly, she scolded Jia Qingqing a few hundred times in her heart, but she still walked over with a caring look.</p><br/><p>\u201cQingqing, what happened to you? Are you feeling alright today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing was currently on the verge of throwing a temper. She frantically said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. The moment I look at Ning Xi, I\u2019ll just forget my lines, as if I\u2019ve been possessed by an evil spirit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be?\u201d Ning Xueluo didn\u2019t really believe Jia Qingqing\u2019s words, thinking that it was Jia Qingqing\u2019s originally poor acting skills and laziness. However, she still held onto her patience and reassured, \u201cYou\u2019ll get better eventually, I\u2019ll help you with practice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo accompanied her for one round of practice, and Jia Qingqing managed to speak her lines smoothly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, isn\u2019t this good?\u201d Ning Xueluo said encouragingly.</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing recovered her self-confidence and took the initiative to look for the director, \u201cDirector, I\u2019m ready now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng had wrestled back his calm somehow. He spoke with a slightly warmer expression: \u201cThen let\u2019s start!\u201d</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>This time, Jia Qingqing forgot her lines as usual.</p><br/><p>She refused to give up and tried again and again. In the end, she continuously ruined the scene 28 times!</p><br/><p>It was such an easy scene, but they still couldn\u2019t finish filming it even until night time. Finally, the production crew were all complaining.</p><br/><p>This was a movie, not a TV series. They had to use rolls of film. She had failed the scene so many times, what a waste of manpower and money!</p><br/><p>After the 33rd failed attempt, Jia Qingqing stood there in a daze. Suddenly, she screamed sharply and lunged towards Ning Xi crazily.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, you little bitch. What did you do to me? Why can\u2019t I remember my lines! Why can\u2019t I remember my lines! It\u2019s you! It\u2019s definitely something you did\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant and the people standing around hurriedly tried to pull her away. In the end, she pushed them all away crazily. Even Ning Xueluo who had gone up to persuade her had been scratched once.</p><br/><p>This time, she had really gotten everyone to hate her.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really braindead. She couldn\u2019t remember her own lines and it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault? Did someone else enter her brain and steal the lines? She made everyone stay back so late and she\u2019s not even the tiniest bit sorry for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor her to somehow provoke someone like that, Ning Xi\u2019s quite pitiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think yesterday\u2019s incident was a little strange? The moment Jiang Muye entered the cast, all that stuff happened to Ning Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Ning Xi gets chased out of the cast, who profits the most?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even need to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking up to here, everyone displayed knowing expressions.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

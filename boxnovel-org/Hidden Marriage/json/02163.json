How is there not a name yet!? Is it that difficult? Little Treasure\u2019s name is Lu Qingyu, so grand and cool. The second kid\u2019s name has to be something similar as well! Why not call him Lu Qincang? It\u2019s uniform and cool together! Lu Aotian works as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cStupid! The doctor said it\u2019s a girl! It\u2019s a girl, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was unhappy. \u201cWho said that girls can\u2019t be called Lu Aotian!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched and she forced a kind smile. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll use that name for your future daughter! We\u2019ll see if she\u2019ll calls you father in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli thought about it carefully, then he kept quiet.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer gave it some thought. \u201cHow about Lu Jinghao? Quiet and good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang suddenly laughed as he was munching on some peanuts. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s okay for Little Junior Sister\u2019s daughter to use such a lady-like name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glared at him dangerously. \u201cTang Lang! What do you mean?! What\u2019s wrong with my daughter?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang replied immediately, \u201cOnly the name of Lu Yuetian would be worthy of your daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi almost cursed, but she glanced at Lu Tingxiao and forced herself to stop talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the names you guys have thought of are useless! Look at mine!\u201d Jiang Muye showed Ning Xi the names he had been thinking about and had written down on a piece of paper.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took it doubtfully. Her eyes were blinded by the names Jiang Muye wrote.</p><br/><p>Lu Yuyan, Lu Nangzhuo, Lu Fengqu, Lu Biejin, Lu Chulei\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck?! I don\u2019t know any of the words!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye snapped his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s the point, with a name like these, I\u2019m sure no teachers would call her to answer questions! Terrific!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>She was really worried for their daughters in the future\u2026</p><br/><p>They could not reach a conclusion after a long discussion. In the end, Lu Jingli said, \u201cLet my brother decide. He\u2019s among the top three graduates from Chang Chun Teng University with a double Masters degree. The names he\u2019ll think of will surely be great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was holding a paper in his hand, unfazed by the noisy group at all.</p><br/><p>On his paper should be the names he thought of.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over curiously. They wanted to see what kind of names he thought of.</p><br/><p>They then saw the list of names the devil had picked: Lu Aixi, Lu Lianxi, Lu Muxi, Lu Buli, Lu Buyu, Lu Weiyi\u2026</p><br/><p>No one said a thing.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli stared at the list of names for some time. \u201cWell\u2026 I take back what I said\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Secondly, the role fits her perfectly. Plus her A-lister popularity, Zixuan\u2019s getting a role in \u2018Assassin\u2019 is only natural when the conditions are right. In fact, it went very smoothly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter asked again, \u201cThen, may we ask what kind of role is Ms. Han Zixuan playing in \u2018Assassin\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another reporter questioned, \u201cWe all known that \u2018Assassin\u2019 has been revered as a sacred movie that cannot be surpassed in Hollywood. I wonder if Ms. Han Zixuan has ever felt pressured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru said, \u201cZixuan knows the movie very well. She has done a lot of homework and has even temporarily put aside her work with \u2018The World\u2019 in order to focus on acting in this movie well. We daren\u2019t talk about surpassing those before us, but we\u2019ll definitely give our best and let this role shine to reveal its brilliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the character, even though there aren\u2019t many scenes, everyone should know that even for a normal Hollywood movie, to land a role is already extremely hard, especially for a sacred classic such as \u2018Assassin\u2019. The fact that Zixuan could get this role, and especially that she gets to act with King Weir and Lilian, who are such great actors and actresses of Hollywood, it\u2019s already something to be proud of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, we heard that Ms. Ning Xi seemed to have attended the audition for \u2018Assassin\u2019, but Glory World Entertainment had yet to reveal anything. I wonder if Starlight Entertainment has any insider information?\u201d A certain female report quickly seized the opportunity to ask.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi was mentioned, Zheng Anru smiled with a flash of disdain in her eyes, then she said plainly, \u201cRegarding news about Glory World Entertainment and Ning Xi, we Starlight Entertainment aren\u2019t clear and we don\u2019t know anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the movie\u2019s main characters have long been decided upon, and Glory World Entertainment hasn\u2019t revealed anything, so I think you guys can figure it out. Besides, with such a sacred classic being remade, under usual circumstances, Hollywood will only use one actor from China for a role at most. Since Zixuan\u2019s already succeeded in getting in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Zheng Anru did not say it explicitly, what she tried to imply was clearly very obvious.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had probably failed her audition, and even more possibly, both the latest A-listers in the country, Ning Xi and Han Zixuan, had fought for the same role, but in the end, Han Zixuan had emerged as the winner while Ning Xi had failed.</p><br/><p>One of the reporters caught onto the main point and immediately asked, \u201c\u2018Assassin\u2019 has King Weir as the male lead and Lilian as the female lead. Other roles are relatively transparent too. If Hollywood only chooses one role from China this time, that would that mean that Ms. Ning Xi and Ms. Han Zixuan fought for the same role, and in the end, Ms. Han Zixuan won, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru smiled slightly. \u201cWell, we\u2019re not too sure. However, the process didn\u2019t seem not too important. The result is that Zixuan is acting in \u2018Assassin\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Zheng Anru did not say it outright, her words were already very clear. All of the reporters looked like they understood too.</p><br/><p>As they spoke, Xu Tao brought a few assistants over and appeared with Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye!\u201d Xu Tao saw Zheng Anru and called out, \u201cManager Zheng, did you bring your cameo to win an honor for Starlight today?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she saw Xu Tao and Ning Xi suddenly appear there, Zheng Anru instantly sneered. \u201cWhy? Have you brought your outdated female artiste who couldn\u2019t even get a cameo role here to feel a pinch of existence and get some exposure?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It had nothing to do with whose child he was. She was not sure why, but she just felt a strong affinity with him. Ever since the first time she met him, she would feel immensely happy every time she saw him.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s reply made Lu Tingxiao smile.</p><br/><p>Fine, it was better than not asking.</p><br/><p>\"Right, Lu Tingxiao...what did your parents talk to you about just now?\" Ning Xi was almost sure that they had talked about her, so she was curious.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at her and replied, \"We talked about our daughter.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Since when did we have a daughter? Did you lie to them that I\u2019m pregnant? How can I find a child for them by then?\" Ning Xi was nervous all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\"I didn\u2019t,\" Lu Tingxiao replied.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi then quietly waited for him to continue.</p><br/><p>\"I just said that I can only get a hard-on for you, so if they want Little Treasure to have a sister, they have to rely on you, and therefore, they have to treat you better.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned. \"What...this is even worse than lying!\"</p><br/><p>Lying about her being pregnant was much better!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked her in the eye. \"I didn\u2019t lie.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi squinted her eyes. \"Really? Have you tried it with other women before?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t have to,\" Lu Tingxiao replied.</p><br/><p>\"Then how\u2019d you know...you can only...for me...Moreover, if you can\u2019t get a hard-on with another woman, how did Little Treasure come about?\" Ning Xi thought of this key question.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression darkened as if his secret was exposed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi knew he was quite sensitive about this issue so she had never asked him about it before, yet today she had accidentally\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Well...I\u2019m just asking, you don\u2019t have to answer me if you don\u2019t want to,\" Ning Xi quickly added.</p><br/><p>Everyone had something they did not want to talk about. Furthermore, she did not really mind about Lu Tingxiao\u2019s past.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pinched the space between his eyebrows and stayed silent for a little while. After a while, he looked at her and sighed, \"I have never touched any woman before. My parents were worried and even thought that I\u2019m gay, but after I proved to them that I don\u2019t even like men, they were even more worried...Five years ago, they cooperated with Jingli and drugged me, then put me together with a woman. I don\u2019t have any memory of what happened, but I\u2019ve only done that that one time, so Little Treasure should be a result of what happened that time.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes almost fell out of their sockets. She did not expect Lu Tingxiao\u2019s first time to be that miserable\u2026</p><br/><p>\"That's way too much!\"</p><br/><p>No wonder Lu Tingxiao did not want to talk about it. It was surely a hard topic for a man\u2026</p><br/><p>And from Lu Tingxiao\u2019s tone, he seemed to have been drugged heavily\u2026</p><br/><p>So, he might have been...raped\u2026</p><br/><p>No...the devil being dominated? No more thinking about it\u2026</p><br/><p>\"After that, drugs don\u2019t even work on me anymore,\" Lu Tingxiao said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>The psychological trauma he had suffered was too harsh\u2026</p><br/><p>How miserable\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Actually, I\u2019ve always thought that I was asexual before I met you,\" Lu Tingxiao said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her brows. \"Asexual?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded then hugged her. \"So, there\u2019s no doubt, you\u2019re my only one.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

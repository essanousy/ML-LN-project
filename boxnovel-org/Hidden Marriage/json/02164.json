My heart belongs to you, yet you have no clue.</em></p><br/><p>When Ning Xi read this poem to her husband, his eyes were charmed with affection.</p><br/><p>Their lives were really full of challenges. Her husband had put in so much effort to get closer to her, yet he did not know Ning Xi had already fallen for him a long time ago. She had just avoided revealing herself because of her past.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Yuexi\u201d indicated Ning Xi\u2019s path and also her love towards her husband, killing two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>After the name was set, they were troubled by her nickname. They thought of \u201cbun\u201d, \u201csteamed bun\u201d, and \u201cspring rolls\u201d, but they could not decide on a suitable one.</p><br/><p>However, as the little princess grew up, everyone thought of one word: <em>tangyuan </em> [1] <sup>1</sup> !</p><br/><p>She was fair and round just like a <em>tangyuan </em>! How cute!</p><br/><p>There was a point that Lu Tingxiao, Ning Xi, and the Lu family were very worried about. Little <em>tangyuan </em>seemed a little too quiet.</p><br/><p>The two elders were especially afraid that little <em>tangyuan </em>would become like Little Treasure, so they always tried to make her laugh.</p><br/><p>Nurtured by their concern and love, the little princess turned three years old.</p><br/><p>No one in the family was worried about little <em>tangyuan </em>having autism anymore.</p><br/><p>On a certain day with clear skies.</p><br/><p>There was an enraged voice of a man coming from within Platinum Palace \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Yuexi! Come out! I promise I just want to talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was holding a destroyed carrot and looked furious. He stepped into his brother\u2019s house. \u201cWhere\u2019s <em>tangyuan </em>? Where\u2019s that little demon?! Bro, Sister-in-law! Don\u2019t hide her. Give her to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was not even surprised by Lu Jingli\u2019s behavior.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed as she was sipping on tea on the sofa, \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli caressed his carrot. \u201cWhat now? Look at this! My carrots! My cabbages! They were all ruined by your little demon! I want compensation!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little bastard broke my multi-colored glazed glassware a few days ago and killed half of my koi fish yesterday. Now, even my vegetable farm has fallen! Come out! <em>Tangyuan </em>! Show yourself! I know you\u2019re home!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was helpless. Did he really have to come here every day?</p><br/><p>Back then, she had been worried that <em>tangyuan </em>was too inactive. Now, she wished she could lock <em>tangyuan </em>up with a chain.</p><br/><p>She could not stay still for even a second and she had conquered everyone at home.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at Lu Tingxiao worriedly when she saw Lu Jingli going upstairs to look for <em>tangyuan. </em>\u201cLu Jingli treasures his vegetable farm the most <em>. Tangyuan </em>will really get it this time. Don\u2019t stop Lu Jingli later. Teach the girl a lesson!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at his wife calmly. \u201cMmm, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was surprised. Lu Tingxiao doted on little <em>tangyuan </em>the most, but now he agreed not to stop his brother?</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli went around the whole house until he finally found little <em>tangyuan </em>in Little Treasure\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>When Little Treasure saw Lu Jingli grab his sister away, he did not try to help at all. He was as calm as his father.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Seems like someone else is coming!\"</p><br/><p>\"It seems like Alain Passa is just the sous chef. The actual head chef isn\u2019t here yet!\"</p><br/><p>A food journalist almost hyperventilated, \"Oh my god! This is crazy! At his level, Alain Passa\u2019s just a sous chef? Who is this head chef?\"</p><br/><p>Another food blogger made a praying gesture, \"I\u2019m already grateful enough to have the opportunity to see one master in my lifetime, maybe, maybe...I\u2019d be honored enough to see the legendary one\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is it?\" someone asked.</p><br/><p>\"For Alain to only be the sous chef, who else could it be?\" the food blogger raised an eyebrow mysteriously.</p><br/><p>All the other food journalists and bloggers thought of the only one person that fit the criteria simultaneously, although it was unbelievable. The hall started to splutter in disbelief, \"This...this is impossible\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible!\"</p><br/><p>\"There's no way that anyone can invite that person! Or else I\u2019ll swallow this wine glass!\"</p><br/><p>\"And I\u2019ll swallow this spoon!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Time passed slowly and five minutes went by.</p><br/><p>With everyone\u2019s expectations in limbo, the banquet hall\u2019s door opened once again.</p><br/><p>The first person to walk in was an elderly foreigner in a neat uniform, followed by a team that was obviously well-disciplined. The old man led them in slowly and calmly.</p><br/><p>The hotel owner saw the old man and went up to him, stretching his hands out excitedly, \"Mr. Danial, you\u2019re finally here! We\u2019ve prepared everything already! It's all just waiting for you!\"</p><br/><p>The man nodded, politely shook hands with the owner, then walked to the position of head chef.</p><br/><p>Alain who was at the sous chef position took a stiff 90-degree bow, then personally tied an apron on Mr. Danial, and prepared some lemon water for him to clean his hands.</p><br/><p>When William who was sulking at the corner saw the older man, his eyes almost fell out and he started stammering, \"M...master Danial...how is it possible...I...am I dreaming\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>He pinched himself and winced at the pain.</p><br/><p>Master Danial had been his idol ever since he started his chef career; the man had a special place in William\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>He would have no regrets even if he could watch his idol from afar, what more now as he could observe him at such a close distance!</p><br/><p>His disappointment at not being able to perform dissipated into joy!</p><br/><p>Those who had said they would swallow wine glasses and spoons were all in shock.</p><br/><p>\"Someone please pinch me! Pinch me harder! I must be dreaming right now!\"</p><br/><p>\"You had better pinch yourself! I\u2019ve been pinching myself since just now! My thigh is bruised from the pinching! It\u2019s not a dream!\"</p><br/><p>\"Who\u2019s this old man now?\" Fang Ya asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Some crew members who were confused echoed, \"Yeah, who\u2019s this? Someone better than William\u2019s master?\"</p><br/><p>One of the experienced food journalists stared at the older man\u2019s every move and explained in a respectful tone, \"If William represents the top among the younger generations of food practitioners, then his master Alain Passa is the pillar of the industry, representing the highest standard in the culinary field\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What about Danial then?\" Someone asked.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Muye in bondage play! Even in my dreams, I think about tying up Muye and throwing him on the bed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you getting so excited for? You\u2019re not the one going up there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, dammit. Why does it have to be that annoying vixen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously, she\u2019s so annoying. Can\u2019t Muye ask the director to switch her out? She\u2019s not good enough for him at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d Guo Qisheng coughed to signal for everyone to settle down. Then he clapped his hands and shouted, \u201cOkay, everyone get ready. Three. Two. One. Action!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wasn\u2019t affected in the least by the surrounding chatter. When the sound of the director\u2019s voice died down, her expression immediately changed.</p><br/><p>Her eyes became that of a 16-year-old young woman \u2013 pure and clear, and as lively as the sun. Her face was perfectly adorned with a lazy, devil-may-care expression.</p><br/><p>She raised the hem of her skirt, lifted up a foot, and kicked open her room door.</p><br/><p>Next, the camera switched over to Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>A young man laid on the crimson colored bedsheets with his hands and feet bound up. That color made his complexion look even more pale and fragile, giving any observers the urge to ravage him.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the kick on the door, Sun Huanqing slowly opened his eyes. He watched in a daze as a young woman approached the bed with light shining from behind her.</p><br/><p>Meng Changge sat her butt next to the bed. From her bosom, she fished out a packet made of oiled paper. \u201cI had to wait an hour in line to buy these fried chestnuts from Fuxing Store. You gonna eat some?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Huanqing turned his head away and closed his eyes, completely ignoring her.</p><br/><p>Meng Changge peeled one and tossed it into her mouth. She grinned craftily. \u201cNot going to eat? Then I\u2019m going to feed you! In a way that might embarrass you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Sun Huanqing immediately opened his eyes. The expression in his eyes was three parts anger and seven parts humiliation. \u201cYou\u2019re a girl. How could you be this immodest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Changge cast a sideways glance at him and raised her eyebrows. \u201cModesty? What\u2019s the use of feeling shame? Can that kill an enemy or attract a wife?\u201d </p><br/><p>Sun Huanqing exploded in anger. \u201cThe Meng family is loyal and righteous. Each of your forefathers fought on the battlefield for the country, but you\u2026 you spend your days playing hooky and bullying others. How will you face the ancestors of your family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Changge had heard those same words from the people around her so often that her ears had practically fallen off. Using her fingers to plug her ears, she spoke loudly while holding a chestnut in her mouth, \u201cYou\u2019re still unmarried even at this age. There are three ways to be unfilial, but the worst is not having any descendants. How will you face the ancestors of your family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suan Huanqing almost died of frustration from her twisted logic. He spoke haughtily, \u201cThose are two different matters. Besides, my interests lie elsewhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Changge stomped her foot by the bedside. Using the whip in her hands, she lashed Sun Huanqing over and over again. Finally, she lifted his chin in a manner that was neither harsh nor gentle. Her expression was like a cunning and naughty little fox. \u201cDoctor Sun, what do you think of this suggestion? I\u2019ll be your wife. Once I become your wife, I\u2019ll do whatever you tell me to. If you want me to walk East, I won\u2019t walk West. If you want me to be good, I\u2019ll listen to you obediently. Won\u2019t we both be able to face our ancestors this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Huanqing was stunned. A trace of urgency flashed across his face, \u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t speak nonsense!\u201d </p><br/><p>As if she had discovered a whole new world, Meng Changge scooted forward until she was almost touching his face. \u201cEh? Doctor Sun, you\u2019re blushing! You actually like me, don\u2019t you? Why don\u2019t we skip to our wedding night and seal the deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCut\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had been full of anticipation when the director yelled cut. Why stop? Why not continue acting it out ahhhhh! They wanted to continue watching! They wanted to watch them seal the deal!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

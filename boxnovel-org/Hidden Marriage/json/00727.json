Why? Didn\u2019t I tell you through the phone? Because of you, Boss personally gave me half the day off!\" Tang Lang unconsciously touched his waist. Of course, it was not a gun; it was an electric baton.</p><br/><p>\"Uh...Second Senior Brother, what\u2019s up with you? Did you hit your head during the fight with First Senior Brother?\"</p><br/><p>Tang Lang looked at her, his grave eyes free of worldly desires. \"Commoners like you will never understand the feeling of wanting to become a commoner!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, Little Junior Sister, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you. What\u2019s your relationship...with Lu Tingxiao? Is it a one-night stand? A multiple-night stand? Or are you his mistress?\" Tang Lang asked with great interest.</p><br/><p>One-night stand? Multiple-night stand? He might as well say that they were friends with benefits!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was annoyed. \"Nonsense, we\u2019re in an actual, normal relationship!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh my! Are you serious?\" Tang Lang was surprised. \"No wonder someone\u2019s been going crazy recently\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Someone? Who are you talking about?\" Ning Xi faltered.</p><br/><p>\"No one.\" Tang Lang brushed the topic aside and questioned, \"How long have you both been together?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi counted on her fingers. \"Uhm...it\u2019s been three days, including today.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then, you guys started your relationship in D.C?\" Tang Lang was even more astonished.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him. \"That\u2019s right. Haven\u2019t you heard that trials and challenges will reveal true love?\"</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was speechless this time. If that certain someone knew that he had become her best support this round, that certain someone was going to be so frustrated\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi drummed her fingers on the table impatiently. \"It\u2019s my turn to ask you questions now!\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you want to know?\" Tang Lang raised his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you suddenly working for Lu Tingxiao?\"</p><br/><p>\"Everyone wants their needs to be fulfilled.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought about it. It seemed like Second Senior Brother needed Lu Tingxiao\u2019s help and they both had agreed to some terms.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not ask about the specifics of their deal. Sometimes, it was better knowing less.</p><br/><p>Then, she straightforwardly announced, \"Actually, I\u2019m here on business today. Second Senior Brother, are you interested in a part-time job?\"</p><br/><p>Tang Lang\u2019s eyes shone with excitement. \"Oh, a part-time job? I\u2019m interested! I\u2019m short on cash now! Tang Ye closed all my old accounts! How ruthless of him!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi exclaimed, \"He\u2019s already being very kind for not killing you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Tell me, what part-time job is it? Actually, no matter what it is, I\u2019ll do it as long as I get paid!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t agree so soon. I want you to teach a five-year-old boy kung fu. You have to seriously and genuinely teach him what you've got.\"</p><br/><p>Tang Lang brushed his bangs. \"A five-year-old kid? That's quite difficult, isn\u2019t it? Whose kid is this? Important enough to have to ask me personally!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sipped her tea and simply said, \"My son.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

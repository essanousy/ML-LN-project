He squinted. \u201cThe little brat isn\u2019t sick. He\u2019s been poisoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Ning Xi and Tang Lang instantly look horrified. Tang Ye was a little shocked too.</p><br/><p>Onlu Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes looked exceptionally deep in thought, almost as if he seemed to have expected this outcome\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat poison is it? How do you know? Why would Little Treasure suddenly be poisoned?\u201d Ning Xi asked all at a go.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen pulled Little Treasure\u2019s shirt down and said, \u201cNeither can I be sure about how he was poisoned, nor do I know what poison it is, but I can be sure that he was poisoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Yun Shen\u2019s answer, Ning Xi almost died from fury. He might as well have not answered anything.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen seemed to have fallen deep in thought about a certain memory. He slowly said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen someone who was poisoned like this. At first, they also had a fever repeatedly. The interesting thing was that they would have a fever the first day, get well the second, get a fever the third day, and then recover the next day again. Every time, the fever would cause them to be weaker and weaker, and their spirits would worsen too. In fact, the cause was so mysterious as if the perpetrator was torturing the victim for fun, giving someone hope and then instantly making them hopeless. It repeats like this, and these victims have one distinctive feature on them, that is, some red color blood specks would appear on their skin slowly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard Yun Shen, Ning Xi quickly took a closer inspection at Little Treasure\u2019s body. Indeed, there were many red color specks, which were there from the start, but there had been very few amd she thought that it was just a common allergy or a rash caused by the fever, but now that she looked again, it seemed like those red specks had begun to multiply with Little Treasure\u2019s fever.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would poison a child like this?\u201d Tang Ye frowned.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThis obviously torturous way of poisoning is clearly to avenge something. However, Little Treasure\u2019s usually protected so well. Previously, because of Master Han Xiao keeping watch, all those people were frightened away. When could he have been poisoned? Especially in a way that all of us did not notice at all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was pondering about this when he suddenly had a brazen thought. \u201cWould this poison be related to the person who sent Little Treasure back to the Lu family years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao subconsciously looked at Yun Shen, then she chose her words carefully. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve heard about this poison too. I heard that it can be planted inside someone\u2019s body for a long period of time. It can even hibernate for three to five years before it breaks out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, there\u2019s a huge possibility that when Little Treasure was just sent to the Lu family years ago, this poison was already planted in him, but it only flared up recently. If this really is the case, then it makes sense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi never would have thought that this matter would pan out like this. Because the matter involved Little Treasure, she was extremely worried as she listened to Feng Xiaoxiao\u2019s analysis. Her mind was a mess at this point and she could not think straight at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many days has the little brat been like this?\u201d At this moment, Yun Shen suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao answered, \u201cSix days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Something flashed in Yun Shen\u2019s eyes. \u201cSix days\u2026 I know that from the day they flare up, victims of this poison will die of sudden death on the seventh day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen\u2019s words instantly made Ning Xi\u2019s heart plummet into an endless abyss!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi panicked. \u201cHow\u2019s this possible?! Doesn\u2019t that mean Little Treasure only has less than a day?! Could you be mistaken? If I calculate to when Little Treasure begun having the fever, it\u2019s already the sixth night now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Did this not mean Little Treasure would not make it to the next morning?</p><br/><p>This outcome was like a bolt from the blue, exploding in Ning Xi\u2019s mind.</p></div>\n</div>"}

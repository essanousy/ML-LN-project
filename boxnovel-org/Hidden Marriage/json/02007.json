The two of them weren\u2019t really close with each other when they were in Glory World, but after they went to Starlight, Han Zixuan not only suppressed the artistes from Starlight, but she also made sure to keep an eye on artistes who transferred to Starlight from Glory World. She would never allow anyone to surpass her position!</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone of Yin Youyou\u2019s level was a big threat to her. Common sense dictates that their relationship should be like cat and dog.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, on the surface, Han ZIxuan is very friendly with Yin Youyou. Han Zixuan even brought Yin Youyou to important events together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing started to catch on. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. I remember there was once when Yin Youyou snatched a role from Han Zixuan, but Han Zixuan did not say anything about it. She even told the media that she recommended the role to Yin Youyou, but everyone in the industry knew that Han Zixuan had been aiming for that role\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Xu Tao jumped up. \u201cIs it possible that Yin Youyou has secret information on Han Zixuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery likely!\u201d Liang Feixing nodded.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was impressed by Ning Xi. \u201cMy queen, you\u2019re the best. I never thought of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just watching it from a third person\u2019s point of view, so it\u2019s all just guesswork. I\u2019ll still need Bro Tao to do the work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao then replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, leave it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Feixing sighed, \u201cI\u2019ve adapted a narrow vision and keep thinking about checking Han Zixuan and neglected the others. I think Ning Xi\u2019s guess is correct. Most likely, that\u2019s the case, and the information Yin Youyou has is definitely important. It\u2019s enough to destroy Han Zixuan\u2019s career in the entertainment industry. However, Yin Youyou would never give something like that to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao raised his eyebrows and said confidently, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s a small issue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing raised his eyebrows as well. \u201cAlright then, I forgot we have an expert swindler on our side!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled. \u201cThen, we\u2019ll wait for your good news, Bro Tao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Late at night, in a room in a restaurant.</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou threw her purse on the table and crossed her arms. She glared at the man opposite her impatiently. \u201cTalk! What do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was being polite but his eyes seemed nervous. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you so late at night!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou scoffed, \u201cForget it if it\u2019s about Ning Xi! She\u2019s going to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou was really angry as she remembered the humiliation she suffered backstage at the TV station the other day. She would never give up the chance to mock Ning Xi, which was also the reason why she accepted Xu Tao\u2019s invitation.</p><br/><p>She would love to see Xu Tao being in a dire state.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, you deserve my sympathy, Bro Tao. You just held onto someone so dependent, yet so soon she\u2019s turning into mud, haha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao\u2019s expression looked desperate. After a while, he then said, \u201cYouyou, it doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s happening to me. The one who\u2019s losing the most now is you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou looked disgruntled. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? What do I have to lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao looked at her in surprise. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

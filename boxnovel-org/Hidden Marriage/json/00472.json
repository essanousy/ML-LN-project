With her night vision glasses on, she walked down the stairs carefully.</p><br/><p>She looked through the dead assassins\u2019 belongings to find more information about their identity.</p><br/><p>\"B rank\u2026\" Ning Xi mumbled in surprise. These people were B rank assassins from a group called \"The Sins\".</p><br/><p>The history of The Sins traced way back to the end of the Middle Ages. It was a universally-known rank of assassins whose existence rose to the peak during the last world war.</p><br/><p>Aside from being the forces behind powerful families, some small countries hired top assassins from The Sins as well.</p><br/><p>\"One exists as The Sin.</p><br/><p>The Sin exists to destroy.</p><br/><p>The world is full of sin, humiliating worldly desires; how pathetic!</p><br/><p>One shall use the power of The Sin to destroy the world.\"</p><br/><p>These words were known as the holiest Bible of The Sins.</p><br/><p>B class assassins belonged to the average category among The Sins, only bested by the A class.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, the person who hired B class assassins to kill that person\u2026\" said Ning Xi as she shook her head. They were all trying to get themselves killed.</p><br/><p>The Sins wasn\u2019t some killer organization with a complete system. It was just a list and all the world-class assassins were listed on it. One could look up the rank of the assassin on The Sins before hiring them.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was having doubts about the person who had hired B class assassins to kill that owner of the house.</p><br/><p>\"Someone as handsome as I am is usually the main character in games!\"</p><br/><p>The cartoon figurine that had been thrown to the first floor started laughing, baring its teeth and giving a thumbs-up as well.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled and picked up the figurine. \"You must be my lucky charm, thank you!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m super duper cool!\"</p><br/><p>To which Ning Xi replied, \"Hmm...I doubt so.\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s time to show you my real skills!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied again, \"Didn\u2019t you already show me just now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Young man, hurry, there are still treasures yet to be discovered!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, Ning Xi turned off the switch on the cartoon figurine and it finally stopped blabbering.</p><br/><p>Right after she had kept the figurine on her, she heard irregular footsteps from outside the house.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly hid under the windows and tried to peek outside.</p><br/><p>There were a few men waiting outside and were looking inside the house from time to time.</p><br/><p>These people weren\u2019t assassins from The Sins, their irregular footsteps gave them away.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a phone rang in the pocket of the man who had led the assassins.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi swiftly went up to his body and took out his phone.</p><br/><p>A text message came in from the sender \"Jeffrey\", saying: \"Did you get it?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought for a while, then replied with the man\u2019s phone, \"Done, but we almost lost our lives this time!\"</p><br/><p>The phone rang again a while after, \"Haha, thanks for your hard work! I\u2019ll be adding some extra to your reward. I\u2019ll have my people retreat first as they have something else on their hands!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

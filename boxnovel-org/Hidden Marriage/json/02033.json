All the magazines and economy sections of newspapers were talking about it.</p><br/><p>For the Lu Corporation, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s name almost appeared as much as Ning Xi\u2019s name in the entertainment section.</p><br/><p>The man, who was supposedly controlling the fate of China, was now holding the hand of his wife and trimming her nails.</p><br/><p>His phone rang but Lu Tingxiao was busy with his hands, so he signaled to Ning Xi to pick it up for him.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held the phone with her free hand and placed it next to Lu Tingxiao\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao polished his wife\u2019s nail cleanly as he spoke to the other person on the phone, \u201cYou\u2019re giving me too much credit. As a citizen of China, it\u2019s my responsibility\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao used a lot of technical terms related to economics, so Ning Xi understood nothing about them, but she felt that his tone was a little odd.</p><br/><p>\u201cChange your hand,\u201d reminded Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Ning Xi swapped her hand. Lu Tingxiao continued to polish the other hand which had been holding the phone earlier.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression became gentler as the person on the phone said something. He replied, \u201cMy wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the call ended, Ning Xi\u2019s fingernails were polished like artistic artifacts.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, who called you just now?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao gave her a name.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Ning Xi almost vomited blood. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be more focused!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been on the call with that person while polishing her nails!</p><br/><p>She felt her nails were burdened with great sin!</p><br/><p>With that person calling him this late at night, it seems that things were really tough.</p><br/><p>It was not exactly a bad thing. At least, Lu Tingxiao was not alone, the country was with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m focusing.\u201d The man kissed the girl\u2019s finger.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>Focused on polishing her nails?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was lifted airborne and they went upstairs into the bedroom.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was in the next room and was already fast asleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have to be up early tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, the man put the girl gently on the bed, then he used his long fingers to unbutton her <em>qipao </em>.</p><br/><p>Her ccollarbonewas revealed and the man\u2019s eyes darkened. The next moment, he was kissing her skin.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi trembled a little. \u201cHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t have work tomorrow\u2026 but I\u2019m helping Jiang Muye for his feminine image\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d the man replied.</p><br/><p>In the end\u2026</p><br/><p>The sun was already rising and the chirping of birds came through the window.</p><br/><p>In the bedroom, Ning Xi\u2019s hair was all damp with sweat and she had no more stamina, yet the man in front of her was still energetic.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi woke up, it was not morning or afternoon. In fact, it was already evening and the sky was getting dark.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head and took a look at her phone. As expected, Jiang Muye had called her countless times.</p></div>\n</div>"}

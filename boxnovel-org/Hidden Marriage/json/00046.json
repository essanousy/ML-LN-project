However, the cruel reality is that our feelings aren\u2019t enough to film a movie. The most important thing is funding, so we don\u2019t have any control over things like casting sometimes. Who gets to have the final say? Of course it\u2019s the person who put in the most money!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s heart slowly sunk as she listened. She had been switched, hadn\u2019t she? Why did Chang Li inform her about the filming then?</p><br/><p>\u201cLast night, Director Ning did talk to me. He disagreed with your casting because he felt that you were too new, however\u2026\u201d Guo Qisheng paused.</p><br/><p>Ning XI hated that she couldn\u2019t pull him over through the phone so she could give him a good shake. Couldn\u2019t he say everything all at once?</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Ning Xi, you\u2019re in luck. Another sponsor seems to have taken a liking to you. They indicated that they wouldn\u2019t accept anyone else playing Meng Changge. Work hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s bruised heart was suddenly flying in midair. She felt like she had been taken for a rollercoaster ride by the director, it was too much excitement for her heart! \u201cDirector Guo, you did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you! I almost had a heart attack from the fright!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, youngsters these days can\u2019t keep their cool, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop beating around the bush and just tell me already! Have I been replaced?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. That sponsor has invested 50 million- that\u2019s the combined investment of the Ning family and Starlight Entertainment, so he gets to have the final say!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought the only sponsors for this movie were the Ning family and Starlight. How did another sponsor appear out of nowhere?\u201d Ning Xi felt that it was a little strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sponsor that came in at the last minute, you\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d Guo Qisheng sounded like he was in high spirits.</p><br/><p>How could he be unhappy at this point? A 50 million yuan sponsorship had come out of nowhere, and his movie now had a total of 1 billion yuan in sponsorship. Furthermore, he no longer needed to bow to the whims of the ignorant sponsors and swap out the actress he was most satisfied with.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it! Thanks director!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had just hung up when the door opened with a creak- it was the sleepy-looking little bun.</p><br/><p>She squealed in happiness and threw herself onto the little bun, hugging and kissing him fiercely, \u201cDarling! You\u2019re my lucky star! You\u2019ve helped me avoid disaster every time!\u201d</p><br/><p>From outside the door, the great demon king watched the girl kissing his son excitedly.</p><br/><p>It was clearly all his hard work\u2026</p><br/><p>Forget it, nothing else was more important than seeing the girl\u2019s bright and beautiful smile.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao strolled in, \u201cDid something good happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hugged the little bun who had been dazed by her sudden enthusiasm, \u201cThe director just told me that I won\u2019t be swapped out because the biggest sponsor for this movie took a liking to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Congratulations then!\u201d Lu Tingxiao congratulated her in a deliberately serious manner.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rubbed her chin as she pondered, \u201cThe director didn\u2019t reveal the identity of the sponsor though. Well, they must be someone with especially good taste and vision! Someone who\u2019s really, really handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled slightly, \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Ning Xi was already acting protective. She suddenly thought of something, \u201cI\u2019ll be filming in the day for most of the time, and I may have some scenes to film at night as well. What will happen to Little Treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not answer, but looked to his son.</p><br/><p>After receiving Ning Xi\u2019s warm kisses and hugs, the little bun was in a very good mood. However, upon hearing this bad news, his expression remained blissful. He trotted back to his room.</p><br/><p>Thinking that he was going to lock himself up again, Ning Xi tensed up. She didn\u2019t expect that he would return quickly with a writing board in his hands.</p><br/><p>The words on the board read: fighting.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was so touched that she was about to cry, \u201cThank you darling, you\u2019re really my angel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao watched the two embracing, his gentle gaze filled with unprecedented warmth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

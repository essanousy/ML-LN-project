Idiot! A real idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plagiarism because you said it. It\u2019s stealing because you said it. It\u2019s yours because you said it\u2019s yours. Can your father become mine just because I said so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to accuse him like that when he\u2019s just jealous, does he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did this tiny brand get selected? How shameful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>David scoffed and laughed coldly when he saw the crowd\u2019s reaction. He was extremely thrilled.</p><br/><p>He really had to thank this guy for ending himself. He had no more troubles to worry in the future anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector David, what do you have to say about Mr. Gong\u2019s accusation?\u201d The journalists asked David.</p><br/><p>David sighed with a painful expression, then he looked at Gong Shangze and said, \u201cDirector Gong, it isn\u2019t the first time people have talked about you imitating my style, but as Chinese designers who have similar styles, I respect your effort to promote Chinese culture and have never said anything about it, yet now you turn the facts around and attack me like this. Why are you doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>David\u2019s words directed the unhappy emotions all towards Gong Shangze.</p><br/><p>Even the officials could not just stay still anymore.</p><br/><p>The president of the Lorraine Fashion Society, who was a respectable senior within the industry, Akas, spoke up, \u201cMr. Gong, as far as I know, each and every draft of David was trademarked and there\u2019s no way they are fake. It\u2019s impossible that he stole and plagiarized other people\u2019s work unless you have proof.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze remained silent and did not say a thing.</p><br/><p>David had robbed everything from him: design drafts, computers, and the pen name that they shared. After all, David was the one who worked on trademarking at that time.</p><br/><p>Even if he were to redraw the drafts again, David had trademarked them, so he would be accused of stealing David\u2019s design.</p><br/><p>Akas\u2019s expression became sterner when he saw Gong Shangze\u2019s expression. He warned, \u201cYou might be unhappy with History always being above you, or you could be angry that people are criticizing you of plagiarizing History\u2019s design.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you\u2019re accusing another person of a serious offense under such circumstances. Do you know what the consequences are? If you can\u2019t give me an acceptable excuse, we will remove Spirit\u2019s participation right away. You\u2019ll also be blacklisted in the industry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I can prove what I said is real?\u201d Facing the criticisms from the officials and insults from everybody, the young man was not shaken at all.</p><br/><p>Akas was taken aback by those determined eyes. He then said, \u201cIf you can prove that what you said is real, I\u2019ll give you a fair judgment on behalf of the society.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Gong Shangze nodded.</p><br/><p>David stood there casually. He did not seem worried at all.</p></div>\n</div>"}

It turns out that she needed to give up her spot to the new lady!</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo had a malevolent expression. \u201cI want to report! I want to report that Su Hongguang gives huge amounts of bribes! Even if I die, I won\u2019t let them live well!\u201d</p><br/><p>The lawyer looked sympathetically as he sighed, \u201cMiss Ning, forget it. Did you forget about the Liang family\u2019s background? It\u2019s useless. With the Su family and the Liang family\u2019s current relationship, all those proof you have will be blocked by someone mid-way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xueluo heard this, she turned as white as a sheet and slumped onto the cold metal chair.</p><br/><p>Impossible\u2026</p><br/><p>This was impossible\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2026 Su Yan!</p><br/><p>How could you treat me like this?!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>At the city centre central plaza in Imperial, there were rushing tides of people and traffic was coming from both sides.</p><br/><p>All of the passersby could not help but stop in their steps to look up at the large screen above their heads.</p><br/><p>It was the scene of an intense fight and shoot out. The awe-inspring special effects, the classic plot, and an incredibly familiar face to all of the people in China caught everyone\u2019s attention\u2026</p><br/><p>After the movie trailer ended, the large screen showed a promotional banner: \u201cFirst Day of the Lunar Year. \u2018Assassin\u2019, the return of the king. Stay tuned!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ah, ah! It\u2019s Bro Xi\u2019s \u2018Assassin\u2019! We\u2019ve waited for half a year and it\u2019s finally going to show in theatres! But it\u2019s much faster than I expected! I thought it would be the same as \u2018Thunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u2019 and take at least one or two years!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe filming crew has enough funding. I heard that the special effects team that they hired is super awesome, so naturally they\u2019re very efficient too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Bro Xi is so handsome, oh, oh, oh! Right, who\u2019s that icy beauty who was fighting alongside Bro Xi in that scene? She\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, if I\u2019m guessing correctly, that might be our Bro Muye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck!? Jiang\u2026 Jiang Muye? Are you for real? That\u2019s Jiang Muye in a female outfit? Isn\u2019t he gorgeous? Is he even letting us females live!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had just finished having dinner with the \u201cAssassin\u201d crew. When she went to get her car at the hotel car park, she unexpectedly saw someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao\u2026 Xiao Xi\u2026\u201d Ning Yaohua looked uneasy as he stood across her car as if he had especially waited there for her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi paused in her footsteps. \u201cDirector Ning, is there anything I can help you with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua cleared his throat. \u201cNext month will be the New Year\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not know what he was trying to say. She just stood there quietly.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua wanted to ask whether Ning Xi would go home for the New Year, yet he still could not utter the words.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi, I\u2026 I\u2019ve been wanting to chat with you, but you know the Ning family\u2019s situation in this half year hasn\u2019t been great. The company was impacted hugely. Your mother encountered that unfortunate incident and she became more and more absent-minded. She can\u2019t be left alone. I really couldn\u2019t pull myself away\u2026\u201d Ning Yaohua spoke without really getting to the point.</p><br/><p>Actually, after he had said so much, the real reason was still that he did not know how to face this daughter of his.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua took a deep breath, then he said, \u201cThat incident years ago\u2026 Your mother and I know the truth now, we know that it wasn\u2019t your fault, and that Xueluo had set you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua looked quite embarassed. \u201cI know that it\u2019s too late to say anything now\u2026 but I\u2019m sorry, Xiao Xi, for not believing you back then. Xueluo has been sentenced. She has already received the punishment she deserves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding Ning Xueluo\u2019s matter, Ning Xi knew a little about it. She had also just received news that Ning Xueluo had been sentenced to death.</p><br/><p>Countries abroad did not prohibit drugs, but China was very strict about it. Ning Xueluo had been involved with too huge an amount of drugs, and it was enough for the gauntlet to fall.</p></div>\n</div>"}

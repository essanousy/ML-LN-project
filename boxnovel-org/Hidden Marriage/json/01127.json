He had eight brands under him and he handled low to medium-class brands well, but what he lacked was a luxury brand like Spirit.</p><br/><p>During this period of time, Spirit\u2019s popularity was rising. Along with the attractive bonus for franchising, this made Deng Kuan interested in joining them.</p><br/><p>About half an hour later, Ning Xi brought Han Momo to New Era. After they walked around for a while, they realized that New Era Mall was pretty big and a lot of people came here as well. If the deal with Deng Kuan went well, it would be very advantageous for Spirit\u2019s growth in the Hubei province.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi called Deng Kuan to inform him that she and her assistant had arrived. A short while later, a middle-aged chubby man with a female secretary came to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\"Hello Ms. Ning, I\u2019m Deng Kuan.\" Deng Kuan smiled and shook hands and Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Deng Kuan then led Ning Xi to his office.</p><br/><p>After some small talk, Ning Xi passed her proposal to Deng Kuan as she smiled. \"Mr. Deng, the details of franchising are all in the proposal. Please have a look.\"</p><br/><p>Deng Kuan nodded and started to go through the proposal seriously.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2019ve included some of our latest works inside. Check it out.\" Han Momo presented a well-packed outfit to Deng Kuan.</p><br/><p>\"Mmm...great!\" Deng Kuan smiled. \"Ms. Ning, I\u2019ve been to Spirit\u2019s store twice and I really like Spirit\u2019s quality and designs. Overall, I think it\u2019s great, but, about the price, do you think you could give me a little discount?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied, \"Mr. Deng, I\u2019m sure you understand that quality comes with a price. We\u2019re really looking forward to Mr. Deng\u2019s collaboration as well, so we\u2019ve made a special consideration on the pricing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Heh, Ms. Ning, we\u2019re business people. We\u2019re all aiming to earn more money, no?\" Deng Kuan said suggestively.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Deng, well\u2026\" Ning Xi paused for a short while. \"If I tell you that I can give you more discouan today, then Spirit\u2019s loss will need to be compensated from the materials. It would be a bad thing for both the consumers and you, Mr. Deng. With Spirit\u2019s popularity and assurance in quality today, I believe you can see for yourself, as a smart businessman, you\u2019d be able to understand the full potential of Spirit.\"</p><br/><p>Deng Kuan\u2019s eyes brightened as he looked at this young founder in front of him. He was trying to get a lower price, yet she was so experienced that what she said made sense.</p><br/><p>Spirit\u2019s brand impact and potential was what he was aiming for.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

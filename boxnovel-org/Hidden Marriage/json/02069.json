You\u2019re incredibly good to me. If there\u2019s a next life, I definitely want to be your daughter again!\u201d Ning Xueluo looked touched and her expression feigned innocence as if she did not notice anything.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the garden house in Deer Town.</p><br/><p>Dong, dong, dong!</p><br/><p>The dawn\u2019s peaceful silence was suddenly broken by the clamorous sound of someone knocking on the door.</p><br/><p>The person outside the door yelled earth-shatteringly at the top of their lungs, \u201cNing Xiao Xi! Ning Xiao Xi, come out! Don\u2019t hide inside and not make a sound! I know you\u2019re at home! Quickly roll right out!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi, who was being chummy with Lu Tingxiao in the garden, heard this voice, she instantly spat her tea out and carefully leaned on Lu Tingxiao\u2019s shoulder to peer. \u201cIt\u2019s over! I\u2019m exposed! Blondie is probably going to kill me this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked outside the yard door. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, well\u2026\u201d Ning Xi forced a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xiao Xi! If you can betray me, then you can open this door! Open it!\u201d Jiang Muye was still calling from the outside.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi cleared her throat and explained, \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t do anything. Well\u2026 Do you still remember Orlando?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard this name, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes instantly narrowed. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, he did.</p><br/><p>How could he not remember someone who once coveted for his wife?</p><br/><p>He had kept some records in his heart.</p><br/><p>Clearly, this little notebook of records was very thick\u2026</p><br/><p>Thanks to Big Boss Lu\u2019s extraordinary memory that could remember everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, isn\u2019t \u2018Thunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u2019 going to be in theatres soon? This time, when I went to Lorraine, I inevitably bumped into Orlando when working, and that playboy was at it again. When I thought about how we still have to work together, after all, I didn\u2019t want to make our relationship too awkward. Just as I was worried about this, guess what happened after?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi arrived at this point, her eyes shined like she was keeping him in suspense.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s fingers stroked the girl\u2019s fine hair. His gaze was focused on watching the girl\u2019s animated expressions.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi said excitedly, \u201cThen, Orlando came to the filming location of \u2018Assassin\u2019 to look for me, and bumped into Jiang Muye! He bumped into Jiang Muye in a female disguise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had especially emphasized the last sentence.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised his brows. \u201cWas it love at first sight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi slapped her thigh. \u201cDarling, you\u2019re so smart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not know whether to laugh or cry. This progress was indeed\u2026 hard to imagine\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, you don\u2019t know it. After Orlando saw Jiang Muye in a female outfit, he said that he had fallen into the river of love, then he begged me to help him connect them, and even said that he\u2019d definitely invite me when they get married in the future! He said it so sincerely. Obviously, I had to agree to him\u2026 Hehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was speechless.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was delighted when her fair chin was suddenly gripped lightly by a slightly calloused hand, followed by a deep, sentimental kiss.</p><br/><p>Suddenly being kissed by the devil, Ning Xi widened her eyes and blinked. She was startled. Why did he suddenly kiss her?</p><br/><p>However, it did not matter. Ning Xi was only momentarily stunned before she returned the kiss.</p><br/><p>Moments later, Lu Tingxiao was short of breath as he mumbled against the girl\u2019s lips, \u201cReward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took three seconds before she realized what Lu Tingxiao meant.</p><br/><p>Mmm, was Darling commending her for obediently getting rid of his love rivals?</p><br/><p>She really admired her own comprehension skills!</p><br/><p>At this moment, outside the yard entrance.</p><br/><p>A certain bachelor was still miserably barking, \u201cNing Xiao Xi, you choose your lover over humanity! Our friendship has reached the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi softly muttered, \u201cAh, we can\u2019t be buddies anyway, but I can still be his aunt\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

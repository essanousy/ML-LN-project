Don\u2019t change the topic!\u201d Jiang Muye felt even more sore in his heart as he listened. In his heart, he thought: How can I count as an ex-lover? How can I compare with your childhood sweetheart Yan-gege? You even called out for him in your dreams\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi helplessly said, \u201cFine fine fine, I\u2019m not going to change the topic. Are you trying to expose my relationship with you and Su Yan in front of everyone by making a fuss like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>When would this fellow grow up and be a little more mature!</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye finally shut up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to pay for this dinner, then do as you like!\u201d In the end, Jiang Muye gave a half-hearted reply.</p><br/><p>After Su Yan saw Ning Xi whispering into Jiang Muye\u2019s ears, his brows drew together imperceptibly. Did he have the wrong impression? He had a feeling that the relationship between Ning Xi and Jiang Muye went beyond mere colleagues\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing Su Yan staring in Ning Xi\u2019s direction with a lost expression, Ning Xueluo shook his arm to draw his attention before saying tenderly, \u201cYan-gege, did you bring what I asked you to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan recovered his senses, \u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said so, he passed her a stack of invitation cards before saying to everyone, \u201cIt\u2019s Xueluo\u2019s birthday tomorrow. I hope that everyone can attend her birthday banquet tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! It\u2019s Teacher Ning\u2019s birthday tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe absolutely have to go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Ning\u2019s birthday banquet must be a high-class affair, we all have to go and see it for ourselves!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo smiled with a sweet expression as she handed out invitation cards one by one. When it came to Ning Xi\u2019s turn, she didn\u2019t forget to remind her specially, \u201cJunior, you have to come, okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spun her wineglass from time to time, staring at the clear red wine in it without any expression.</p><br/><p>When it came to Jiang Muye\u2019s turn, he didn\u2019t even bother moving, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me one, I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression stiffened slightly, but she recovered her sweet smile in the next moment. She asked with concern, \u201cAre you busy tomorrow, Muye? Could you postpone it to another day? I really hope that you\u2019ll be able to come! Please please please!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had already promised a few of her close friends who were Jiang Muye\u2019s fans that she would definitely have him at her party.</p><br/><p>Most men wouldn\u2019t be able to reject a beautiful woman using that kind of tone to make a request.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Muye was completely immune to it. Contempt flashed across his eyes as he said impatiently, \u201cI can\u2019t postpone it, it\u2019s my friend\u2019s birthday tomorrow too!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he glanced in Ning Xi\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sipped some wine and remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 what a coincidence. Your friend\u2019s birthday is actually on the same day as mine! It must be a very important friend to you, right? Then what a shame! If your friend\u2019s birthday party ends early, then you\u2019re welcome to come to mine at any time. Our party will last overnight!\u201d Ning Xueluo said, acting as if she were kind and considerate.</p><br/><p>Damn it, she wasn\u2019t able to get Jiang Muye to come. Wasn\u2019t this going to embarrass her in front of so many of her close friends?</p><br/><p>Who was that friend of Jiang Muye\u2019s? That person was not only born on the same day, but was also so important that Jiang Muye would reject her invite in front of so many people!</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, born on the same day\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo cast a glance in Ning Xi\u2019s direction with undecided suspicion.</p><br/><p>She had suddenly recalled that Ning Xi was born on the same day as her, and thus her birthday was also tomorrow as well!</p><br/><p>The friend that Jiang Muye had mentioned couldn\u2019t be Ning Xi, right?</p><br/><p>At this moment, she suddenly remembered something. Wang Taihe had revealed that the last minute investor was Lu Jingli, and her father had told her that the investor had told the director that Ning Xi had to remain as the second female lead. Why would Golden Age Entertainment\u2019s Lu Jingli be so adamant about Ning Xi being the second female lead?</p><br/><p>If her guess was right, that Ning Xi and Jiang Muye\u2019s relationship went beyond mere colleagues, then Jiang Muye must have put in a good word for Ning Xi to his bosses at Golden Age.</p><br/><p>If things had happened like that, then everything made sense\u2026</p><br/><p>This Ning Xi, could she have seduced Jiang Muye?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Tonight at the birthday party, I want you to dump Ning Xueluo. Compared to the humiliation I suffered in the past, I\u2019m only asking that she be dumped. Have I been kind-hearted and understanding enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s complexion paled slightly, \u201cXiao Xi, that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi! How could you be like this \u2014\u2014\u201d The sound of Ning Xueluo\u2019s sobs suddenly came from behind.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi crossed her arms and spoke leisurely, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo looked at Ning Xi with anger and pity, \u201cSure enough, you\u2019re still unable to let go of Yan-gege. That\u2019s why you hate me so much. You hate me for stealing him away! But how could you be so selfish as to use such a cruel way to break us apart! Yan-gege doesn\u2019t even love you. What\u2019s the point of doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw that Ning Xueluo had become so worked up that she could barely breathe, Su Yan rushed to pat her back and comfort her, \u201cXueluo, don\u2019t get so emotional. I think Xiao Xi was just speaking offhandedly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled as she watched the two people in such an over dramatic manner, \u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t speaking offhandedly. Unless, you weren\u2019t being serious just now when you said that you\u2019d do whatever I want!</p><br/><p>\u201cYan-gege, just look at her! We asked her to forgive us with sincerity and humility, but what about her?! She has been making things difficult for us each and every time! You aren\u2019t actually planning on agreeing to her shameless request, are you?\u201d Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression was filled with panic as she lifted her head to look helplessly at Su Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly girl, how could I\u2026\u201d Su Yan patted her head gently. Then, he looked reproachfully at Ning Xi, \u201cSorry Xiao Xi, I can\u2019t agree to this request of yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally grew tired of playing around. She sneered as her interest waned. In a flash, her eyes turned into daggers, \u201cThen get out of my sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, what sort of attitude is this?! If anyone\u2019s at fault, it\u2019s me. This has nothing to do with Yan-gege. How could you treat him like this?!\u201d Ning Xueluo defended Su Yan protectively.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi clapped her hands in applause, \u201cYour feelings for each other could move the heavens and bring people to tears! Well then, Ning Xueluo, surely you would also be willing to do anything to make up for your crimes, and be willing to do anything for Su Yan, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s brows pinched tightly when she heard Ning Xi\u2019s words. Who knew what sort of trap this woman was leading her into? However, there was only way she could answer this question, \u201cOf course! What do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi deliberately muttered to herself for a long time under Ning Xueluo\u2019s alert stare before speaking, \u201cSince things are like this, it\u2019s fine if Su Yan doesn\u2019t dump you, so long as you give up your status as the Ning family\u2019s eldest miss and return to Spring Wind Town\u2019s Tang family Village and live as Tang Xueluo. Then, all the debts between the three of us can be wiped clean. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo suddenly opened her eyes wide, as if she had heard something extremely terrifying. She shook her head violently, \u201cNo\u2026 No way! Ning Xi, how could you be so cruel?! How could you force me to leave mother and father, and force me to leave the home where I have lived for over twenty years? I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi impatiently waved her hand to interrupt Ning Xueluo, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, that\u2019s enough. Your acting is so terrible, you might as well just stop. It really burns my eyes to watch! I\u2019ve asked you two before to stay away from me as far as possible, but it\u2019s always the two of you who are constantly coming to approach me for forgiveness and asking me to come up with some sort of request. You two even solemnly vowed that you\u2019d do whatever I asked. When I actually came up with one, your faces had \u2018oh no how can you be so heartless, so shameless and so unreasonable\u2019 written all over them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, how is this making amends? Your words were spoken so pleasantly, but they only apply under the conditions that your own interests aren\u2019t harmed and the request is an insignificant act of charity! The two of you don\u2019t seem to find this hypocritical, but I find it rather nauseating! Therefore, I have only one word for you two. Scram.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As for the earrings, they were designed by one of the top designers in the country, Fang Yi.</p><br/><p>Ning Qiutong's eyes lit up. \"Great! You look marvelous!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you! You have really great taste!\" Ning Xi smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Such a sweet-talker you are, but why do you have such a terrible relationship with your family?\" Ning Qiutong sighed.</p><br/><p>\"I'm only a sweet-talker with people whom I like!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Qiutong beamed happily. \"Come here. I'll do your hair for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\" Ning Xi sat in front of the dressing table.</p><br/><p>Ning Xiutong used a comb and brushed her hair gently. \"Let me think what kind of hairstyle to do for you, but you look so great already. I don't think I have much to do here\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at Ning Qiutong's loving expression through the mirror. She had an indescribable feeling when her hair was being caressed by Ning Qiutong's gentle fingers\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Qiutong realized that Ning Xi's eyes were a little red, so she asked nervously, \"Xiao Xi, what's wrong?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shook her head. \"It's alright, I just slept too late last night, so my eyes are a little irritated.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, in the banquet hall, everyone was chatting, drinking, bonding, and talking about business. Some people even tried to look for a partner for their children. All in all, the atmosphere was very lively.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu was bringing Ning Xueluo around with pride. No matter where she went, everyone had nothing but praises for them.</p><br/><p>\"Madam Ning, when are we going to get invited to your daughter's wedding?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sadly, my useless son is late!\"</p><br/><p>\"You're so blessed, Madam Ning. You have an understanding husband and such a capable daughter. Now there's even an excellent son-in-law!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu looked at her daughter in her elegant white dress, and she patted her shoulder. \"My biggest achievement in my life is to have Xueluo as my daughter!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo acted bashfully. \"It's my blessing to be your daughter!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was really jealous of how close they were. Most of the higher-class families did not have good relationships with their children, who were usually rebellious and arrogant. None of them would be as obedient as Ning Xueluo was!</p><br/><p>\"Lingyu, I heard that your sister-in-law who stayed overseas has returned recently?\" A lady went up to Zhuang Lingyu and asked.</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, yes, she's back.\" Zhuang Lingyu did not look very happy when her sister-in-law was mentioned.</p><br/><p>\"Coincidentally, my husband was looking for people to collaborate on his project. Would you mind introducing us?\" The lady made a request.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu frowned, but as she was about to reply, the hush fell over the hall.</p><br/><p>Everyone stared towards the entrance.</p><br/><p>There was a lady in a golden dress along with a stunning girl behind her. They both entered the hall regally.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Promise that you\u2019ll never be involved with other people\u2019s men ever again. Crawl out of this bar, then I\u2019ll forget about what happened tonight! If not, don\u2019t even think about leaving this place!\"</p><br/><p>\"You want to leave after offending our Miss Li? Not so fast!\"</p><br/><p>The lady\u2019s bunch of thugs slowly closed in. Ning Xi glanced at those thugs and calmly cracked her finger joints\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, Sis Lan, what has this girl done to you that has got you so angry?\"</p><br/><p>Mister Li who had been enjoying his drink at the VIP seat suddenly walked over and looked at the lady with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"Yo, Mister Li\u2026\" Seeing him, the lady\u2019s expression softened and she said, \"Weren\u2019t you always unfavorable of poor and disgusting witches like her? Why are you helping out people like her today?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sis Lan, I really like this girl, so give me some face and don\u2019t bother her anymore,\" Mister Li explained like a gentleman.</p><br/><p>\"Mister Li, you're interested?\" the lady said, stunned. \"Fine, since you like her, there\u2019s nothing much I can say. With the power you have, a night would get you at least 50 thousand dollars! What a lucky girl she is!\"</p><br/><p>A few girls around tittered in secret.</p><br/><p>Mister Li was infamous for being crazy in bed. Who knew how many women had been tortured by him! Any girl would have it coming rough for themselves if they were favored by Mister Li. But if there was money involved, it probably wouldn\u2019t matter to a woman like this.</p><br/><p>\"Miss, I\u2019ll buy you for a night for 50 thousand dollars. Just follow me now, or else you\u2019ll have a hard time leaving the bar after offending Sis Lan!\" Mister Li acted as if he was confident of getting his way, as he swaggered towards Ning Xi like a hero and was about to hold her hand.</p><br/><p>The next second, Ning Xi slapped away Mister Li\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\"You...\" Humiliated, Mister Li\u2019s face darkened in an instant.</p><br/><p>Without a word, Mister Li\u2019s group of supporters and thugs joined in the fray as well. Ning Xi was now going up against two groups of people; it felt like a fight would blow up at any moment.</p><br/><p>\"What a lively night.\"</p><br/><p>Among the noisy, chaotic atmosphere, an ice cold voice striked through the hearts of the people present like a frigid wind.</p><br/><p>Suddenly everyone was looking behind Ning Xi, speechless.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi herself was frozen as well. This voice was...</p><br/><p>The devil\u2026?!</p><br/><p>As Lu Tingxiao appeared, the few ladies in front were stunned.</p><br/><p>This man who just made his sudden appearance could barely be described with just the word \"cool\". His behaviour could not hide his extravagance. Just one icy look of his was enough to let someone fall for him mercilessly..</p><br/><p>\"Oh my god! Who is this man? He's so cool!\"</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s not just handsome! It\u2019s his aura! So charismatic! Very manly!\"</p><br/><p>\"I thought Chengyun was as manly as a man can get, but in front of this man he\u2019s nothing!\"</p><br/><p>Miss Wang just stared blankly at Lu Tingxiao, blushing. The man in front of her was like a god. He was the definition of her dream man. Just by looking at him, she suddenly felt that all the cute boys she was proud of were trash compared to him...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

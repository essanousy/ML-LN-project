My dearest babies, Little Master is back!\"</p><br/><p>Despite it being winter soon, at the entrance of the lift stood Lu Jingli, wearing a short-sleeved floral blouse with a hula skirt on his waist and slippers on his feet. His hair was a mess, as if a reminisce of his time by the sea. He was indeed an eye-catching sight.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, even though he dressed like crap, he was still eye candy and all the female employers shrieked emotionally.</p><br/><p>\"Second...Second Master!!!\"</p><br/><p>\"Aaaaaah! Second Master is back!\"</p><br/><p>\"Second Master, you're back! Didn't you say you were taking a three-month holiday?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli handsomely ruffled his messy hair and laughed, \"Hahaha! Of course, it was because I missed you guys.\"</p><br/><p>\"Aaaaaah! Second Master, we really missed you too!!!\"</p><br/><p>\"Second Master, the way you dress today is really impressive!\"</p><br/><p>\"So handsome, so handsome, so handsome! Second Master, can we take a picture together?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>What day was it? Lady Luck was on their side! Not only did they see the Little Master, even Second Master who had been on vacation for a long time returned.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, please do! Right, babes, I've brought back some souvenirs for you all! Everyone gets one,\" Lu Jingli said as he delightedly clapped his hands.</p><br/><p>Behind him, a few servants walked in carrying several big boxes.</p><br/><p>Everyone stared and saw that the boxes were filled with big coconuts...</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli said arrogantly, \"These are all personally picked by yours truly. I almost broke my head getting these for you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Aaaah, Second Master, you're too thoughtful!\"</p><br/><p>\"Such a special souvenir! I love it! Thank you, Second Master!\"</p><br/><p>\"Second Master, can you please sign on my coconut?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mine too, Mine too! Actually, can you sign on my body?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>As they watched the group of female employees rush up excitedly, all the male employees could not bear looking at the scene. Haih, if a person was born handsome, even if they had poor fashion sense, they could still win the hearts of a bevy of beauties by simply gifting coconuts...</p><br/><p>While they mulled this over, a few of them actually embarrassedly took a coconut to him for his signature...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

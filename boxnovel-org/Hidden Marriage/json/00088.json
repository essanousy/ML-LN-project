Even Amy was scared witless.</p><br/><p>With a pale face, Ning Xi swept an ice-cold glance across those fans, \u201cYou guys can make a commotion if you want, come at me. Don\u2019t hurt innocent bystanders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop\u2026 stop pretending to be good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Don\u2019t pretend to be a good person! You\u2019re just a shameless vixen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s look turned even sharper, \u201cWhat determines whether I\u2019m a good person or not? An internet post without evidence to back it up? Or a rumor based on groundless accusations? Even though you are all still young, I still hope you can all use your brains before taking action. Idols are the ones who have to pay for the conduct of their fans. Your words and actions will represent your idol. Don\u2019t allow yourselves to be ignorantly used by others and mar your idol\u2019s reputation for no good reason!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi knew that at this moment, nothing she said would get through to them except mentioning their precious idol.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen was it your turn to lecture us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually I think she has a point\u2026 The one who just threw that rock, step out! Didn\u2019t we agree that we wouldn\u2019t resort to violence and using eggs would be the limit?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Who was it! We came to ask for justice, not to mar Muye\u2019s reputation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The rioting fans temporarily calmed down, and Ning Xi was finally able to squeeze into the production set.</p><br/><p>When Guo Qisheng saw that she had arrived, he immediately called her into the lounge. \u201cNing Xi, you\u2019ve come! Hurry and sit down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, I\u2019m sorry for creating so much trouble for the production team\u2026\u201d Ning Xi had a guilty expression as she bowed deeply.</p><br/><p>When he saw how haggard the girl looked, Guo Qisheng quickly comforted her, \u201cYou\u2019re not the one creating trouble. How could I be not be aware that other people are trying to ruin you? Just based on that line about you having no acting skill, that\u2019s simply nonsense! As for saying that you\u2026 uh, saying that you slept with members of the production team\u2026 how could I not know the truth as one of the ones implicated in the rumour? I\u2019ve seen plenty of matters like this before. I\u2019m clear on who\u2019s right or wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Director.\u201d The fact that Guo Qisheng was standing on her side in this sort of situation really made her grateful.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, this matter has really affected you too much. Just look at your haggard complexion. Why don\u2019t you take a couple of days off to recover?\u201d Quo Qisheng proposed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately responded, \u201cNo need! Director, I want to continue shooting! My situation has already inconvenienced the production team enough. If this delays the production\u2019s filming schedule even more, I really won\u2019t be able to live with myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng saw her determination and showed a grateful expression, \u201cAy, alright then! If you reach your limit, you have to let me know!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she came out of her meeting with the director, a strong force suddenly pulled Ning Xi into a secluded corner.</p><br/><p>That person\u2019s face was full of worry and even his head of golden hair looked listless. \u201cNing Xi, is your arm ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small injury. It has already been treated.\u201d Ning Xi spoke lightly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s face was filled with anger, \u201cI was going to issue a statement to explain to my fans, but Ming-ge changed my Weibo password and wouldn\u2019t let me log in. He said that I would make things worse for you if I did anything right now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi patted her chest and showed a glad expression, \u201cLucky Ming-ge has intelligence unlike some people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye immediately looked hurt, \u201cYou ungrateful woman, I was just trying to help you out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied helplessly, \u201cIf you really want to help me, then let me give you a heads-up. In a moment, I\u2019m going to pretend to be an innocent flower. Just act along with me, and don\u2019t you dare act recklessly! Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for really breaking off all relation with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye scratched his ear and looked rather doubtful, \u201cWhat did you say you were going to pretend to be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn innocent flower, is there any problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure a tyrant flower like you can complete such a difficult challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

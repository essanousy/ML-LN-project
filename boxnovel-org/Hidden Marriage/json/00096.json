I\u2019ll come over later.\u201d Lu Tingxiao said calmly.</p><br/><p>However, on the other end of the phone, Ning Xi was stunned, \u201cAh? You\u2019re coming over?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is there a problem?\u201d Lu Tingxiao returned the question, his tone slightly cooler.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No problem\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s tone was too matter-of-course, she couldn\u2019t refute it.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ning Xi at a loss after hanging up the phone, Jiang Muye poked his head out and asked, \u201cWhat happened? Who called?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour uncle, he said that he\u2019ll be coming over later\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d The spoon in Jiang Muye\u2019s hand fell to the ground with a clatter. He then pointed at her and lamented with grief, \u201cNing Xiao Xi, you told me that there was nothing going on between you two. We\u2019re just having a meal together, why did you call him over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, don\u2019t throw a temper at me, okay?\u201d Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, feeling a headache coming on, \u201cI didn\u2019t call him here. He asked where I was and I just replied very normally that I\u2019m having a welcome dinner with you. Then he said he was going to come over. It\u2019s most likely because he feels that he should take care of you as your senior? So he\u2019s coming over to eat together? That\u2026 seems to be his logic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye threw a bowl on the floor, \u201cWhat logic! Do you think Lu Tingxiao is the kind who would get close to people? You think he would eat dinner with me? When my mum tries to invite him out for a meal, she gets scheduled in half a year later! Distance is his middle name!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi impatiently tossed a pillow at him, \u201cYou terrible kid! Can\u2019t someone be concerned for you? Why do you have to keep putting me and Lu Tingxiao together? How do we even seem compatible?\u201d </p><br/><p>Jiang Muye mumbled to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s a man\u2019s intuition\u2026 what do you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the time that they were quarrelling, the doorbell rang.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gave a warning glare to Jiang Muye, indicating that he should be careful with his words, before rising to open the door.</p><br/><p>The moment she opened the door, Ning Xi\u2019s immediately lit up in pleasant surprise, because a little bun was following at Lu Tingxiao\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing her, Little Treasure threw himself at her with his short little arms wide open, as if he hadn\u2019t seen her in ages. Ning Xi\u2019s heart melted and she quickly picked him up, \u201cDarling, you came too! I was still sad that I couldn\u2019t eat dinner with Darling tonight!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the house, Jiang Muye looked at Ning Xi carrying Little Treasure, then glanced at Lu Tingxiao, who was watching them with affection in his eyes. He had the feeling that they were a family of three.</p><br/><p>He had never expected that Ning Xi would actually get along this well with Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was an existence that was even harder to get close to than his dad!</p><br/><p>As for Lu Tingxiao, his attitude towards Ning Xi was very strange.</p><br/><p>Even if it was for Little Treasure\u2019s sake, knowing Lu Tingxiao\u2019s personality, he couldn\u2019t possibly bear living with a strange woman under the same roof\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey hey, don\u2019t forget about me, I\u2019m right here!\u201d Lu Jingli squeezed in, carrying two bottles of wine.</p><br/><p>Seeing that all three members of the Lu family had come, Ning Xi immediately tossed a look at Jiang Muye that said \u2018see, they\u2019re all just here to care for you\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, Second Uncle, and even Little Treasure came. Come in quickly\u2026\u201d Although he wasn\u2019t extremely pleased, Jiang Muye could only obediently invite them in.</p><br/><p>Who was it that let him be born in the younger generation\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Actually, these are all things that one must experience on the road to becoming famous, it\u2019s good for her to get used to it! If she doesn\u2019t face these obstacles, how else is she going to stand on her own!\u201d Lu Jingli copied the tone that Lu Tingxiao usually took when lecturing him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need it.\u201d The meaning in his words, was that he was there to protect her.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli: \u201c\u2026\u201d Heh heh.</p><br/><p>A desolate wind blew in Lu Jingli\u2019s heart from his own brother\u2019s biased treatment.</p><br/><p>He thought in his heart, that wasn\u2019t what you said back when you threw me into that shithole Golden Age without saying a word and preventing anyone from helping me!</p><br/><p>\u201cFine fine fine. I\u2019ll send someone to watch the set! I\u2019ll make sure she won\u2019t miss even a single strand of hair!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a week\u2019s holiday for next week.\u201d Lu Tingxiao suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 Bro, what did you say?\u201d Lu Jingli thought he had hallucinated, \u201cYou\u2019re actually giving me a holiday, and it\u2019s a whole week! You haven\u2019t let me take a break for the past three years!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do, I do, I do! Of course I do! But\u2026 why are you suddenly treating me so well?\u201d Lu Jingli couldn\u2019t understand no matter how hard he thought. He recalled the words he had said earlier.</p><br/><p>Finally, he felt that the issue had come from something he had said at the start: sister-in-law.</p><br/><p>He got a break just because he had called Ning Xi sister-in-law?</p><br/><p>This break was making him both happy and sad\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Young Master, Dr Qin is here.\u201d A maid reported from outside the study.</p><br/><p>A lanky man stood beside the maid, dressed in casual clothes. His appearance was warm and kindly, and his smile was like a refreshing breeze, he looked very friendly.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao hung up and turned towards the arrival, \u201cYou\u2019ve come, please take a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng set down the bag in his hands and sat on the sofa, \u201cWhat happened? How\u2019s Little Treasure\u2019s condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can see for yourself, he\u2019s in the kitchen.\u201d Lu Tingxiao replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe kitchen?\u201d Qin Mufeng raised an eyebrow, then stood up to stride to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>After just a moment, Qin Mufeng was back, and he smiled, \u201cWhen did Little Treasure pick up the hobby of making fruit juice? And I see that he seems to be in good spirits! Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething did happen recently. A few days ago, I was too busy at work and I wasn\u2019t able to take care of Little Treasure, so Jingli secretly took him to a bar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao explained everything to him simply.</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng\u2019s expression kept changing as he listened, before he finally said happily, \u201cAt least it was a blessing in disguise for Little Treasure! I\u2019ve said this before, Little Treasure is currently too lifeless. If there were some driving force that could make him feel interest in life, then it would help his recovery greatly. Furthermore, this is a living person! You didn\u2019t keep the girl as a nanny or home tutor for Little Treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cShe\u2019s going to be Little Treasure\u2019s mother in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng coughed three times in succession. He looked at Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expressionless face in surprise, \u201cWhat did you say? Are you doing it for Little Treasure, or for yourself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s chilly expression seemed to have melted. He looked out the window, and said slowly, \u201cDr Qin, I think your previous verdict was right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you\u2026 fallen in love with this girl?\u201d Qin Mufeng was extremely agitated upon hearing so, \u201cI knew it, my verdict couldn\u2019t be wrong. How could you be asexual! Quick, tell me what the situation is. Does your heart beat faster, does your blood boil, do you want to get closer to her, do you want to make love to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao lowered his gaze and thought about it seriously for a while, then nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re basically right!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

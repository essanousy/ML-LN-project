Aside from the keyboard warriors and celebrity fans, there were still a lot of sane and smart people on the internet. The incident might have appeared normal, but after some research, it was not so simple after all.</p><br/><p>On the surface, due to Fang Ya\u2019s conflict with Ning Xi, she had picked Ning Xi as her target to frame, but if Ning Xi\u2019s reputation was destroyed, the person who would benefit the most would be Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s popularity was rising quickly, becoming even more popular than the main actress, Ning Xueluo. Ning Xueluo\u2019s fans started messing with her but in the end, Jiang Muye\u2019s fans fought back for Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Soon after, some unproven rumors about Ning Xi being Hu Hongda\u2019s mistress started to circulate, then Hu Hongda spoke up Weibo personally\u2026</p><br/><p>Was this series of incidents really a coincidence? Was Ning Xi just unlucky?</p><br/><p>Could Fang Ya have been ordered by Ning Xueluo? They always seemed to be close to each other!</p><br/><p>Not only that, Ning Xueluo maintained a low profile for some time in hopes that people would forget the incident when she framed Ning Xi, but it was all being brought up again and people started to suspect that the assistant involved at that time had been ordered by her\u2026</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? Why didn\u2019t you stop the news from spreading? Even then newspapers are writing about it!\" Ning Xueluo yelled angrily.</p><br/><p>\"You...you can\u2019t blame me! You were so confident and you even said that there would be no problem, so I didn\u2019t pay much attention. Who'd have known that things would turn out this way overnight?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, I\u2019m confident there'll be no evidence! If I left any, do you think I\u2019d be standing here yelling at you? The point is, their comments don\u2019t need any proof at all!\"</p><br/><p>\"Should I sue the newspapers for defamation? But...they are careful with their words, surely they worded them ambiguously and we can\u2019t do anything about the comments online\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Delete as many online posts as you can, just leave the published newspapers. Stop the other newspapers from publishing any more negative news about me!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ning Xi was bringing a big bouquet of beautiful balloons and flowers to the office.</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi was busy, so when she heard someone knocking on her door, she replied without even looking up, \"Come in.\"</p><br/><p>Footsteps were heard, then a big bouquet of fresh mint-colored balloons and bright flowers were nudged right in front of her. Ling Zhizhi was surprised. \"What\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled at her and gently said, \"Sis Zhizhi, they are for you!\"</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi returned her a smile as well. \"Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>She forgot when was the last time she had received flowers. Her insomnia and fatigue went away the moment she saw the fresh flowers and the girl\u2019s lovely smile.</p><br/><p>\"Right, Sis Zhizhi, when I was looking through Weibo this morning, many people suspected that Hu Hongda\u2019s incident is related to Ning Xueluo. Even a few mainstream media sources reported it...were you behind this? Actually, I thought about it before, but I have no evidence!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

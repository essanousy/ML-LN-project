It must be poisoned.\u201d Lu Jingli immediately wanted to spit it out but his face changed quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFML! Delicious! What is this? Crispy on the outside but melts as you bite it! Too delicious! How can food be so delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no man\u2019s stomach that I can\u2019t catch with this right?\u201d Ning Xi asked as she sat with folded arms, waiting.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli nods enthusiastically \u201cThis is great! If I could have such a wife that could cook like this, I would make sure to be home for dinner everyday!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli sends a knowing look towards his brother. It seems that marrying Ning Xi is the only option.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to go bury your little babies now?\u201d Ning Xi asked playfully.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli looked at her seriously: \u201cNo, no. Your pot is the best destination for them! From now on, use as many of them as you want! Just feed me too when you cook! Ah, this crayfish is delicious. This steak too! What kind of spices did you put in this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli continued: \u201cI\u2019ve tasted a lot of food, but I\u2019ve never eaten such unique taste before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my own special seasoning. How can I tell you the recipe? Hey. Hey, stop! You\u2019ve had enough! Leave food for the rest of us, we\u2019ve been busy all day and haven\u2019t had some to eat yet!\u201d Ning Xi cautioned Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Don\u2019t start yet! I want to take a picture to send to a couple of my friends. This food looks too delicious. I really didn\u2019t know you could cook like this Sister-in-law\u201d. Lu Jingli then whipped out his phone and circled the table taking a lot of photos.</p><br/><p>He then went on the family Weibo page and posted: \u2018Look! Everyone! My future sister-in-law\u2019s cooking is really delicious! Thieves are really envious of my brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you send?\u201d Ning Xi asked curiously, trying to peek at his phone</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli immediately put his phone away, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret! How can you easily spy on other people, what about my privacy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares about your privacy! I see that you have a group chat, too!\u201d Ning Xi took out her phone, opened WeChat and added Lu Jingli to her friends.</p><br/><p>As a result, it didn\u2019t work out as Ning Xi expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Jingli, what did you write at the end of that photo? I can\u2019t see anything! You also set my name to invisible!\u201d (I\u2019m guessing you can edit how people\u2019s names are displayed, and he set hers invisible so the family members cannot see it and stalk her.)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to write!\u201d Lu Jingli replied. \u201cIt\u2019s my right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd they are my cooked dishes in the photo!\u201d Ning Xi retorted.</p><br/><p>Watching the two noisy people argue, Lu Ting Xiao quietly pulled out his phone and opened up Lu Jingli\u2019s post. When he read the words \u2018my future sister-in-law\u2019, he understood why Jingli wouldn\u2019t show it to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao noticed that within a few minutes, a large amount of comments had shown up.</p><br/><p>Mo Ling Days: I can rely on you! Didn\u2019t I tell you last time? Is that real food? Such skill! I didn\u2019t know Lu Ting Xiao prefered homely type of girl as his wife.</p><br/><p>Qing Mu Wind: I\u2019m surprised, she knows how to cook? I believe, she will become a good wife and mother.</p><br/><p>Lu Father: Yes.</p><br/><p>Lu Mother: Oh yes, this girl is really good! These days, lots of girls don\u2019t know how to cook. Is that my Little Treasure\u2019s hand in the corner? It\u2019s getting nice and fat. Good!</p><br/><p>Some of the other comments praised Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s good fortune. Others asked when he was bringing her to meet the family, or when can they come to the house to see her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way Little XiXi, your manager has been decided!\u201d Lu Jingli quickly changed the topic.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was immediately distracted from the pictures: \u201cReally? Who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you. However,\u2026if you promise me a meal I will!\u201d Lu Jingli tried to bargain.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glared at him, then turned to Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cLu Ting Xiao, who is it?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

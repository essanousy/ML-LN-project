Lu Tingxiao couldn\u2019t resist stroking her head again, \u201cDo you like diamonds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Ning Xi hadn\u2019t expected that he would ask a strange question like that, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday today, so Little Treasure prepared a birthday present for you. It seems like it has something to do with diamonds. I was worried that you might not like it, so I\u2019m asking on his behalf.\u201d Lu Tingxiao explained with his normal expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d Ning Xi scratched her head upon hearing this, then said, \u201cUm, I think there probably isn\u2019t a single woman who doesn\u2019t like diamonds, right? However, it\u2019s just my birthday, it\u2019s not good if he sends me something so expensive. Since he\u2019s just a kid, I won\u2019t accept it. It\u2019ll be better if he does something handmade!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if it had just been a careless thought, Lu Tingxiao added on, \u201cIt\u2019s not something very expensive. That diamond you received on set the other day is more expensive. I\u2019m just afraid that no other diamonds will seem as good to you after that one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately facepalmed, \u201cEven you know about that! As expected, gossip travels a thousand miles\u2026 Don\u2019t compare yourself with that weird guy, he\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy is your boyfriend?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi almost choked on her saliva, \u201cPfft\u2026 how could it be! How did you get such a scary thought?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you seem rather close to him.\u201d Lu Tingxiao explained in a slightly sad tone.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt a headache coming on, \u201cHeavens! How do I seem close to him? Does calling him crazy make it seem we\u2019re close?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded, \u201cIt does, to me. You\u2019re always very polite to me, and you\u2019ve never criticised me even once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi really didn\u2019t know what to say. Was the great demon king Mr Lu a secret masochist? He actually wanted people to treat him a little worse?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, that guy has nothing to do with me now! He\u2026 he\u2019s just crazy, he just likes throwing diamonds at people! If I meet him again, I\u2019ll definitely throw it back at him!\u201d Ning Xi spoke in a carefree tone, but when speaking of that man, a trace of fear shone in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has nothing to do with you now, then that means there was something in the past?\u201d Lu Tingxiao caught the main point with precision.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi coughed lightly, \u201cThat\u2026 I guess we could be counted as exes\u2026 If a single day counts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, she cared about the image that Lu Tingxiao had of her. She scratched her head and asked, \u201cLu Tingxiao, do you think it\u2019s bad that I\u2019ve dated so many men before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had a solemn and respectful expression on. He replied her with utmost gravity, as if her question was a particularly important one, \u201cNo, everyone has their own way of living, and there are always stories behind their actions. Anyone who doesn\u2019t know the whole truth doesn\u2019t have the right to stand on a moral high horse and criticise or punish others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly felt a burst of warmth in her head. Following that, she immediately smiled gently, \u201cLu Tingxiao, why do I feel like you\u2019re one of my brain dead fans? No matter what I say or do, you\u2019ll always feel that I\u2019m right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrain dead fan?\u201d Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t seem to understand what this term meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, a brain dead fan will support their idol completely, even against all reason!\u201d Ning Xi explained.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pondered it for a moment before muttering, \u201cHm, that\u2019s rather fitting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While looking like she was deliberately suppressing some sort of emotion, she sunk into silent thought for a while. After some time, she let out a long sigh, \u201cLu Tingxiao\u2026 do you know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know that you\u2019re even more scary than aphrodisiacs!\u201d Ning Xi had a very conflicted look on her face. She then tugged at her collar with a painful expression.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

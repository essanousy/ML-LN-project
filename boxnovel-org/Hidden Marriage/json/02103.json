Moreover, if Li Muyan had taken action earlier, this whole fuss would not have happened in the first place.</p><br/><p>She had been pretty busy a while back then and had been spending most of her free time with Lu Tingxiao, so she never noticed anything odd about Li Muyan since he never did anything overboard. She only thought of him as the son of her aunt\u2019s good friend.</p><br/><p>Only just now did she feel like something was wrong with the way Li Muyan looked at her.</p><br/><p>Eliza\u2019s attitude and tone of speaking further confirmed her guess.</p><br/><p>If Li Muyan stepped up and resolved the issue, she would not have needed to pull this off. She could just find a chance in the future and explain it to him.</p><br/><p>However, Li Muyan chose to do nothing about Eliza\u2019s provocation. Therefore, she could only use her own method to solve the issue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Eliza could not say anything back to her.</p><br/><p>Eliza did not want to admit defeat. She merely wanted to regain her pride somewhere else.</p><br/><p>She then judged Ning Xi\u2019s gorgeous appearance tonight. \u201cToday is Mr. Lu\u2019s birthday. The spotlight should belong to Mr. Lu and Mrs. Lu. Aren\u2019t you being rude for dressing so extravagantly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s outfit for tonight was indeed very high-profile and attractive.</p><br/><p>Ever since she appeared, many people had been secretly judging her, especially the young girls at the venue. Of course, all the men were checking her out too.</p><br/><p>The crowd suddenly felt that she was inappropriately dressed as well after Eliza pointed it out.</p><br/><p>Events like these would usually invite celebrities to lighten up the mood; Ning Xi was not the only celebrity there. All the other celebrities tried to avoid being the spotlight and wore more plainly, except Ning Xi, who wore a very attention-grabbing, bright red dress.</p><br/><p>Red was the color that represented China. Usually, only the host would wear this color and the guests would all avoid it.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s outfit was indeed unseemly.</p><br/><p>Several girls came together and started discussing. \u201cNing Xi is being a little too high-profile, isn\u2019t she? Is she trying to embarrass Mrs. Lu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s just an actress, after all, so she wouldn\u2019t know about all these rules, would she?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, loud voices came over from the entrance. It seemed like the main person of the night had arrived.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao, who usually wore dark colors, had actually put on a maroon suit today, appearing more fresh-looking than usual.</p><br/><p>Probably because of his birthday, he seemed to be in a jovial mood. The man\u2019s face was not as cold as usual and he looked more lively.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO Lu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Lu, happy birthday!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy birthday!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst the well wishes, the man nodded and made some small talk with the guests. At the same time, he walked towards the center of the venue.</p><br/><p>The man did not stop until he reached in front of a girl in a long, red gown. He appeared before the girl like a bright sun in the sky.</p><br/><p>The man stood before the girl, his arm casually wrapped around the girl\u2019s waist before he lowered his face and left a precious kiss on the girl\u2019s soft, petal-like lips.</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s face bloomed into a smile as she gently murmured, \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p><br/><p>The frigid man melted and he smiled back. \u201cThank you, milady.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

You\u2019re my manager so you should fix this! Are you trying to embarrass me? I\u2019ve already told Xueluo I got the endorsement!\"</p><br/><p>The manager said helplessly, \"Yueling, I\u2019ve been utilizing all my networks and doing all I could since they released the result. Cook isn\u2019t just the director of this advertisement, he is also currently the art director of Noble. The endorsement is totally up to him, there\u2019s nothing I can do!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why don\u2019t you contact Cook directly? It doesn\u2019t matter how much money he wants!\"</p><br/><p>The manager quickly advised, \"Don\u2019t be reckless, Yueling. Do you think I haven\u2019t thought about this? Things are different here. These foreigners don\u2019t care about money, especially an art enthusiast like Cook. I\u2019ve asked his assistant. He\u2019s been completely charmed by Ning Xi; she\u2019s his goddess muse! It\u2019s impossible to change his mind...unless\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Unless what?\" Li Yueling quickly asked.</p><br/><p>\"Unless you can be an ideal model compared to Ning Xi in his eyes.\"</p><br/><p>The manager was telling the truth but she had touched a fresh wound, so Li Yueling exploded, \"If I can do it, then what would I still need you for?! Useless! Idiot! You can\u2019t even settle something like this! This is why Ling Zhizhi is always above of you!\"</p><br/><p>The manager was really unhappy, thinking that she had been below Ling Zhizhi all this time because of Li Yueling\u2019s lack of ability. After investing so much money and resources, she still could not even win a presentable award.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the doorbell rang.</p><br/><p>The manager opened the door, surprised to see who it was. \"Ms. Ning? Why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Xueluo is here?\" Li Yueling quickly went to the door and was surprised to see Ning Xueluo standing outside. \"Xueluo, why are you here? Come in!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo sat down on the sofa, then looked at Li Yueling. \"I\u2019ve already heard about the Noble endorsement.\"</p><br/><p>Li Yueling\u2019s expression froze. \"I\u2019m sorry, Xueluo, I messed up the opportunity that you gave me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo signaled for Li Yueling to sit beside her and comforted, \"Don\u2019t blame yourself, Yueling, it\u2019s not your fault! You didn\u2019t want this to happen!\"</p><br/><p>Li Yueling looked at her and Xueluo and thought of something. \"Xueluo, why don't you go and talk to Director Cook? You gave up the auditions for me but since things went south, we can\u2019t just let Ning Xi have the advantage! You can surely defeat her with your talent!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo said numbly, \"It\u2019s not just about talent. Ning Xi loves to use dirty tricks and innocent ladies like us don\u2019t stand a chance against her. It was all my fault. If I had known Ning Xi would join the audition beforehand, I could\u2019ve reminded you to be more careful!\"</p><br/><p>Actually, Ning Xueluo did not even get through the initial audition and she had lied in order not to embarrass herself. On a side note, she could get Li Yueling on her side by doing her a favor, striking two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>If she went up to Cook now, she would find out about her elimination in the initial phase of the audition.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

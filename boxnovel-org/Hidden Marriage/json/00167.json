Our feelings are mutual, are there any problems?\u201d Lu Tingxiao replied her question with one of his own.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Our feelings are mutual. The way he used that phrase\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was the last person in the world that Ning Xi would want to cause trouble for. Therefore, she asked very solemnly, \u201cAre you sure that you don\u2019t need to think it over some more? I think that I can be quite the troublemaker. What if I cause trouble for you in the future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you need a management company if you could handle everything yourself? That\u2019s exactly why I exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Ning Xi rubbed her nose.</p><br/><p>In any case, she had discovered that even though the great demon king was a man of few words, every word he spoke carried a great deal of weight. She couldn\u2019t win him in a battle of words.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought carefully for a moment. Since Starlight had wronged her so many times while she was under their management, it was only natural for her to ask for the termination of their contract and no one would use the topic to malign her. Now that the penalty fee was settled and clearing her name was just a matter of time, it was unlikely that she would bring Lu Tingxiao any trouble.</p><br/><p>After reflecting for a bit, she was finally able to rest at ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Boss, I\u2019ll definitely work hard to earn you money to repay your kindness in hiring me. You won\u2019t be disappointed!\u201d Ning Xi immediately expressed her sincerity to her boss.</p><br/><p>She was still confident in her abilities!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled slightly, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ning Xi\u2019s cell phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>The caller ID showed \u2018Corrupted Devil King\u2019.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye had called many times previously, but she had been too busy and then she had suddenly fallen ill. There simply hadn\u2019t been any time to call him back.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t try to hide anything from Lu Tingxiao. She went ahead and accepted the call, \u201cHello? Jiang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she had a chance to speak, a roar that almost shattered her eardrums came from the phone\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xiao Xi, where the hell are you?! Why are you playing around at a time like this?! Do you know how badly people have been shitting on you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had gone to the Lu Residence once to find her, only to be told by the butler that she wasn\u2019t there, and neither was Lu Tingxiao. That day just happened to be her birthday and the two of them had disappeared at the same time. What else could he imagine?!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi speechlessly rubbed her ear, \u201cWho\u2019s been playing around?! I\u2019m at the freaking hospital!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was stunned for a moment before his tone immediately turned anxious, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re in the hospital? What happened to you? Did you get beaten up by someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi frowned slightly, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who got beaten up! I just had a fever, that\u2019s all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich hospital are you at? I\u2019ll come over to see you right away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. You\u2019re so busy, just focus on your family matters first. My fever has already gone down and Lu Tingxiao is here with me. Little Treasure will be coming over later too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person on the other end suddenly went silent for a couple of seconds. Then, she heard Jiang Muye speak gloomily, \u201cNing Xi, have you looked at the email I sent you yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. I haven\u2019t had the time. I\u2019ve been dealing with one problem after the other ever since two days ago and I haven\u2019t had a single moment of rest! It\u2019s a long story, but I\u2019ll tell you about it later when I have the time.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye took a deep breath, \u201cRemember to look at it as soon as possible. Also, I need to ask you, what are you planning to do about the situation with Ning Xueluo? I was going to help you find that bastard Zhang Qiang, but when I sent someone to deal with him, his place was already completely empty. You\u2019re part of Starlight so I can\u2019t use my company\u2019s PR department, but I consulted with Ming-ge and I\u2019ve contacted a reliable public relations team for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi responded gratefully, \u201cThanks for that, Jiang Muye, but that won\u2019t be necessary. I\u2019ve already gotten some evidence that will prove my innocence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye ground his teeth together, \u201cWas it Lu Tingxiao again?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In an instant, her guilty conscience made her face blush, she wished she could crawl into a hole in the ground as she avoided the nurse\u2019s gaze in shame.</p><br/><p>Damn, although it has already been such a long time after that one drunken night, that hot night she had with Su Yan kept appearing in her dreams from time to time.</p><br/><p>Thanks to being drunk to the point of unconsciousness, she did not have much memory of that night, otherwise she would not know how to face Yan-gege.</p><br/><p>The nurse saw that she had finally woken up, and passed the papers in her hands to her: \u201cYou forgot to take your pregnancy health results, Dr Zhang would like you to come again next week!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi received the report, smiled sweetly, and carefully placed the papers in her own purse.</p><br/><p>Su Yan was still studying overseas, he was coming back tonight. Thinking of the meeting tonight, Ning Xi unconsciously tensed up.</p><br/><p>Because the area Su Yan was at was too inaccessible, it was only until the child was more than 7 months old that she finally contacted him.</p><br/><p>Thinking of the shock that Su Yan had when he found out she was pregnant, Ning Xi was a little nervous.</p><br/><p>Was it because she was particularly sensitive due to the pregnancy? Ning Xi felt that Su Yan was not as happy as she was about this.</p><br/><p>The doctor reassured her saying that men were always like that with their first child, their mentality would take some time to change!</p><br/><p>But\u2026\u2026 it couldn\u2019t be that, even regarding marriage, she would have to be the one to speak up?</p><br/><p>The sun was burning brightly in the sky when she came out of the hospital.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi struggled to support her waist, just as she was about to wave down a taxi, a dazzling red sports car rushed towards her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s heart thumped, and she retreated quite a few steps back.</p><br/><p>Only to hear a screeching sound from the brakes, as the red sports car just brushed over the edge of her clothes, before stopping abruptly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s heart almost stopped; after slowly regaining her footing, she saw a woman, wearing a body-hugging red dress, toss her wavy hair as she stepped down from the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xueluo, are you crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo looked at her, laughing with deep meaning. With crossed arms, as if strutting on the catwalk, she swayed as she walked until she stood in front of Ning Xi. Using the advantage of her high heels, she arrogantly looked down on the big bellied Ning Xi: \u201cWhat? Scared that I\u2019ll kill the bastard in your stomach?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi subconsciously protected her abdomen, taking a step back, she looked at her warily: \u201cNing Xueluo! Don\u2019t you go too far!\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite knowing that Ning Xueluo had always been at loggerheads with her, Ning Xi had not thought that she could speak such vicious words.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing too far? You\u2019re the one who went too far! After getting drunk and doing it with some wild man and getting pregnant, then trying to make Su Yan become the father, tsk tsk\u2026\u2026 Ning Xi, aren\u2019t you so shameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi froze, \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t tell me you really believe that the man who slept with you that night, was Su Yan?\u201d Ning Xueluo laughed before leaning back: \u201cSaying that you grew up with Su Yan since you were kids with every other sentence, saying that you\u2019re childhood sweethearts, and you don\u2019t even know what his figure is like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi grew paler as she listened, despite standing under intense sunlight, her whole body felt cold.</p><br/><p>Yes, the man from that night\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She had only thought\u2026\u2026 Su Yan was fitter than she had imagined after growing up.</p><br/><p>Now with Ning Xueluo\u2019s malicious reminder, she then suddenly recalled that, other than the body, the man from that night was indeed very different from Su Yan\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>TL Note:</p><br/><p>-gege () \u2013 An affectionate term from a girl, to an older guy she has a romantic interest in. She is very obviously trying to get close to a guy if she uses this in front of him. It could also be shortened to just \u2018-ge\u2019. The literal meaning is \u2018older brother\u2019. Think \u2018oppa\u2019 in Korean. The subtlety was hard to translate so I\u2019ll be leaving in its original form.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

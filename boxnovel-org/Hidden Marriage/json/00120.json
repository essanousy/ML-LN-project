Indeed, there must be something wrong with your eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi slowly swept her eyes over him, \u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with your eyes. Someone like Su Yan can score at least 9 out of 10 points, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing so, Jiang Muye exploded, \u201cWhat the ****, how could he possibly score 9 points!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi said in a matter-of-fact tone, \u201cJust based on the fact that he\u2019s someone I\u2019ve loved before. If I say that he sucks, isn\u2019t that basically hitting my own face? Anyway, leaving aside my subjective viewpoint, from an objective viewpoint, you can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s worth 9 points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile Su Yan\u2019s looks aren\u2019t a match for yours, where you are capable of even blinding people with one glance, he wins in terms of his temperament. He\u2019s the warm and refined type; if he was in a fairy tale, then he would be a prince. If he was in an ancient tale, he would be an elegant gentleman. Ooh, a pure gentleman with no equal\u2026 Basically he\u2019s the type that I liked the most in my teenage days, the kind that I would fall for at first sight!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fire in Jiang Muye\u2019s heart grew even stronger as he continued listening, \u201cDamn, Little Ning Xi, do you still have feelings for him? You\u2019re practically praising him to high heaven!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, \u201cI really don\u2019t care about him anymore. How else could I use such an impartial tone to praise him in front of you? What kind of IQ do you have!\u201d</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the one she was describing was merely the Su Yan living in her memories, the lively and perfect teenage boy, not the present Su Yan.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, it was because memories felt too perfect that reality seemed even more cruel in comparison.</p><br/><p>It took Jiang Muye a long while to push down his anger. He asked in a low, muffled voice, \u201cThen how many points would you give me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rubbed her chin. Under Jiang Muye\u2019s anxious gaze, she replied: \u201c9.9 points! Just based on your face, you get that many points!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing so, Jiang Muye\u2019s temper was soothed. He touched his own face, and pride showed in his expression, \u201cOf course! I depend on my face to earn my living! However, why did you deduct 0.1 from my points?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at him as if she were looking at an idiot, \u201cDo you even need to ask? Of course I took it off because of your low IQ!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Forget it, forget it. Seeing that she had given him 9.9 points, he wouldn\u2019t continue quibbling with her.</p><br/><p>With a twinkling expression, Jiang Muye couldn\u2019t resist asking another question, \u201cThen\u2026 What about Lu Tingxiao? How many points would you give him? Right now, in your heart, what type of man is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Lu Tingxiao\u2026\u201d It was a little hard for Ning Xi to answer this question. After thinking for a long time, she finally replied, \u201cI don\u2019t dare to judge the great demon king. If you\u2019re talking about type, then he\u2019s the type that you can watch from afar, but can never be touched or played with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks like a calm sea on the surface, but you\u2019ll never know what\u2019s hiding in the depths of the waters. This kind of man is unfathomable. If you dive in too deep without careful consideration, you might just drown in his depths!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing so, Jiang Muye\u2019s expression turned much warmer, \u201cHmph, at least you still have some rationality left!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Ning Xi muttered to herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Jiang Muye asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi propped up her chin and smiled, \u201cBut, if I died in such a splendid way, it\u2019d be worth it to become a ghost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c****! Little Ning Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha, I\u2019m just joking, just joking. Don\u2019t get so worked up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye almost expired from anger, \u201cI think you\u2019re spouting truth after drinking too much! I thought that you had some intentions towards Lu Tingxiao from the start! Are you thinking of sleeping with him?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

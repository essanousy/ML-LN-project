So Lawyer Chen had only been saving his strength to bring out his finishing move?</p><br/><p>Chang Li was even more flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>The three lawyers facing them were in a similar state too.</p><br/><p>Just as Ning Xi and Lawyer Chen were preparing to leave, the lawyer from the Ning family, Cai Yingyong abruptly stood up in excitement. With an expression that was equal parts shock and suspicion, he asked Lawyer Chen, \u201cPlease wait a moment! If I may be so bold, I\u2019d like to ask you a question! Are you\u2026 Are you, by any chance, the great Lawyer Chen, Chen Jing?</p><br/><p>The other two lawyers standing at his side displayed their shock on their faces upon hearing that, \u201cWhat\u2026 Chen Jing? Which Chen Jing? It\u2026 It couldn\u2019t possibly be that Lawyer Chen, could it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>They had completely looked down upon the mystery lawyer that Ning Xi had brought in just now, so they hadn\u2019t asked for his identity. However, the more they thought about it now, the more it seemed like something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>Although they had never seen Chen Jing with their own eyes before, they had long heard of the way he worked.</p><br/><p>He was a man of few words to the point that people would think he was mute, but once he started working, it was as if he had flipped the crazy switch; rapid-fire speech, irrefutable logic, words straight to the points, explosive fighting power\u2026</p><br/><p>Lawyer Chen completely ignored Cai Yingyong and walked out of the meeting room without a single pause in his stride.</p><br/><p>Left behind in the room, Chang Li collapsed onto a chair, all the blood drained out of her face.</p><br/><p>They were done for!</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo had repeatedly told them not to let Ning Xi break her contract, but now, their plans were all spoiled.</p><br/><p>The lawyer that Ning Xi had hired turned out to be the number one lawyer in the capital, the great Lawyer Chen?</p><br/><p>Why would the great Lawyer Chen come all the way here just to help Ning Xi negotiate a matter as small as terminating a contract?</p><br/><p>This lawyer charged by the minute, and it cost an arm and a leg to hire him!</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026 that Ning Xi\u2019s backer was this lawyer?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Even until she had walked out of Starlight\u2019s building, Ning Xi was still a little dazed. She hadn\u2019t expected that this stuffy and stiff-looking lawyer could actually be that fierce.</p><br/><p>Were all the lawyers in Golden Age\u2019s legal department so epic?</p><br/><p>While lost in her lamentations, a large group of reporters suddenly swarmed around her at the entrance to the building\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi! Ning Xi! Have you come to give yourself up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have anything to say about how you attempted to kill Ning Xueluo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xueluo has generously announced that she\u2019ll give you a chance to turn over a new leaf as long as you apologise. Do you feel ashamed for your actions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask if you were also the one behind the previous matter with Jia Qingqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Starlight Entertainment is going to terminate your contract and blacklist you, is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The reporters kept pushing forward in a craze, squeezing Ning Xi in. She only had two arms to defend herself against the swarm and it wouldn\u2019t be very good for her image if she started beating up the reporters, so her hands were tied. Just as she was trying to think of a way to extract herself from the crowd, five well-trained bodyguards in black suits came out of nowhere and controlled the crowd in no more than ten seconds. They protected Ning Xi in the center without letting anyone through.</p><br/><p>The reporters exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>What was happening?</p><br/><p>Where had these people come from?</p><br/><p>How could a little actress like Ning Xi, without any power, money or background and in dire straits, hire bodyguards like these guys? There were even five of them all at once!</p><br/><p>In order to avoid causing a scandal and unwanted rumours for Ning Xi, the bodyguards didn\u2019t carry any emblems identifying that they worked for the Lu family. However, it was enough to scare off those reporters.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stood within the bodyguards\u2019 protective circle and faced all the reporters with a cool and calm expression. She pitched her voice so they could all hear: \u201cFirstly, I\u2019m innocent, so I don\u2019t have to give myself up. There\u2019s also no reason for me to feel ashamed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecondly, the truth for Jia Qingqing\u2019s incident has already been made clear, please don\u2019t try to obscure the facts and mislead the public, otherwise that\u2019s slander!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirdly, I have terminated my contract with Starlight, just a few minutes ago. However, I was the one to initiate the termination and they weren\u2019t the ones to cancel my contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly, if they want to blacklist me, then I\u2019d like to see them try!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

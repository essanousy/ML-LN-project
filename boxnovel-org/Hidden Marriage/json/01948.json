Even they had never seen Jace himself, including the assistant director.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have gone far! I\u2019ll give her a call!\u201d The assistant director said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll chase her,\u201d replied the female staff.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, how was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao, who had been waiting outside, quickly asked her when she came out.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought about it. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got half a chance, I suppose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome enough that you have some chance. Leave the rest to me and Liang Feixing. This time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xu Tao and Ning Xi were talking and walking towards the car park, suddenly there was the sound of rushed footsteps behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Ning Xi, please wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned around, surprised to see the staff from earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Linda?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Ms. Ning Xi!\u201d Linda clasped her chest as she panted heavily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Ning Xi smiled and gave her a questioning gaze, unsure why she was being chased.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Ning Xi, our producer would like to meet with you to discuss the movie,\u201d she said very politely.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned before she asked, \u201cProducer? You mean Mr. Jace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Jace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not just Ning Xi, even Xu Tao was taken aback when they heard the affirmative answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Jace wants to see Ning Xi? W-What is it about?\u201d Xu Tao quickly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Jace wants to see Ms. Ning Xi, but I\u2019m not sure why. Ms. Ning Xi will know once she meets him.\u201d The lady smiled nervously as if she was afraid of messing things up and not being able to bring Ning Xi over.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Xu Tao looked at each other questioningly.</p><br/><p>While Ning Xi was popular in China, she meant nothing to Hollywood, especially for people of Jace\u2019s caliber. He probably did not even know of her existence.</p><br/><p>Even Ning Xi did not expect that her trying today would lead to meeting that person.</p><br/><p>In the end, Xu Tao replied decisively, \u201cPlease lead the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, follow me!\u201d The lady looked relieved.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After about half an hour\u2019s car ride, Ning Xi entered a high-class private club with the staff.</p><br/><p>As they arrived at a room, the lady told Xu Tao, \u201cPlease wait outside here, Mister.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then made an inviting gesture to Ning Xi and opened the door for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Ning Xi thanked her and took a deep breath before going inside the room.</p><br/><p>Inside, there was an old man with a head full of white hair. He seemed to have waited for a long time.</p><br/><p>The old man looked like he was pondering about something, then he raised his head and looked at Ning Xi\u2019s direction when he heard sounds at the door.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had been preparing herself mentally on the way here, so she looked somewhat calm. \u201cHello, Mr. Jace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a careful look at the old man as she greeted him. It was a standard European face around 80 years old, and he looked quite kind, which was unimaginable given Jace\u2019s popularity.</p><br/><p>However, Jace was a mysterious person. None of the magazines dared to put Jace\u2019s picture on print.</p></div>\n</div>"}

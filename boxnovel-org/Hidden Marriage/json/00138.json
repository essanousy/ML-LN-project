Large tears formed, flowing along the rims of her eyes; they appeared one after another, seemingly endless\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao was in a complete panic because of the girl\u2019s tears, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you hurting anywhere? I\u2019m sorry I came late\u2026 Don\u2019t cry anymore\u2026 I\u2019ll send you to the hospital\u2026 You\u2026 don\u2019t cry anymore, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>His heart was about to stop beating.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes were red while tears still rolled down her face. With some effort, she tried to raise her hands, but they fell halfway.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to get up?\u201d Lu Tingxiao immediately leaned over and helped to prop her up.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to help her off the bed, her arms suddenly embraced his neck. Her head buried into his shoulders and her body trembled from her cries. Her tears quickly dampened his clothes, flowing along his neck\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao felt as though a knife was stabbing at his heart. He reached his large hands out to gently pat her as if she was a fragile piece of glass, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared\u2026 Everything\u2019s fine\u2026 Everything\u2019s fine\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the extreme panic and fear, Ning Xi cried for at least ten minutes before she stopped and started to hiccup.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao patiently helped her to regain her breath, and because he was scared of alarming her, he stiffened his body and didn\u2019t dare to move.</p><br/><p>After a long while, Ning Xi finally calmed down and hoarsely spoke into his ear in an extremely weak and helpless tone he had never heard before, \u201cLucky it\u2019s you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>She just said, lucky it\u2019s you.</p><br/><p>These three words strongly struck him and echoed in his heart.</p><br/><p>At some time, perhaps even she had not realised it yet, but his girl already trusted him that much.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi forced out a smile, stammering, \u201cLu Tingxiao, you don\u2019t know, how horrible today was\u2026 Before I saw you\u2026 I was already starting to doubt life, and I almost gave up all hope in this world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She had thought that she was infallible and she had thought that there was nothing more that could knock her off-balance. However, when what happened that night five years ago was about to happen again, she could not help but fall apart.</p><br/><p>She had thought about it previously. Even if Zhu Xiangcheng wasn\u2019t intending to take her himself, he was most likely going to give her to someone else. Birds of a feather flock together. Someone who hung around Zhu Xiangcheng would definitely be an even more nauseating man.</p><br/><p>Right now, she was happy that she had guessed wrongly, but she had not expected that the person Zhu Xiangcheng wanted to curry favor with was actually Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes flashed with killing intent, but his tone was extremely gentle when he spoke up, \u201cSorry, I was the one who dragged you into this. I wanted to help you out that night, but it caused a misunderstanding with Zhu Xiangcheng. I didn\u2019t foresee that he would do this kind of thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I blame you? You were trying to help me.\u201d Ning Xi suddenly realized she was still sprawled across his body and immediately tried to straighten up, saying awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I made your clothes dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl knelt there with a tear-stained face. After losing the layer of flower petals covering her, her thin clothes did nothing to protect her modesty.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao coughed and directed his eyes elsewhere, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d </p><br/><p>Ning Xi tried to straighten her body but started to sway. Lu Tingxiao hurriedly supported her, \u201cAre you alright? I\u2019ll send you to the hospital!\u201d \u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi flushed and shook her head, \u201cWith this type of drug, there\u2019s no cure even if we go to the hospital! Oh, um\u2026. Lu Tingxiao, can I ask you for a favor?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

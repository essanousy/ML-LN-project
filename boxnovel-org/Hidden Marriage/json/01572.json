Neither did he bring anyone, nor did he use an umbrella as he went into the cemetery with Yun Shen.</p><br/><p>Under the rain, they walked silently up to a gravestone.</p><br/><p>Qiao Yi's expression turned cold when he saw the gravestone. His hands balled into fists.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen remained quiet as he lay the white roses in front of the gravestone.</p><br/><p>There was a picture of a young woman on the gravestone. She looked beautiful, but her expression seemed a little poignant.</p><br/><p>Qiao Yi stared at the picture with a furious gaze. \"After so many years, I'm finally back... Don't you worry. I'll get everything that belongs to you back!\"</p><br/><p>Yun Shen turned around and lit up a cigarette, the smoke covering his indifferent attitude and the ridicule in his smirk.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, at Platinum Palace.</p><br/><p>The audition was in a few days' time. Ning Xi was going through the script like there was no tomorrow when she suddenly received a call to accept a delivery.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went down to get the delivery. After some effort, she lugged the bulky, heavy box into the house with Lu Tingxiao's help.</p><br/><p>\"What's this?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi opened the large box suspiciously. Although she had bought something on the Net recently, she did not remember buying something this big!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi removed the outer packaging and a black wooden box was revealed inside.</p><br/><p>\"Wait.\" As Ning Xi was about to open the box, Lu Tingxiao stopped her and dragged her behind him, then he opened the box.</p><br/><p>The moment it was opened, Ning Xi covered her eyes with her palms and groaned, \"Ooh, what...?!\"</p><br/><p>My eyes!</p><br/><p>Gold!</p><br/><p>A whole box full of gold!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned for a while, then she carefully bit on one of it. \"Damn! It's real! These are real! What's happening? Which madman send me a box of gold?!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao studied the gold. He thought of something and his eyes turned cold.</p><br/><p>He saw a gold card on the top of the glittering pile. Lu Tingxiao picked it up cautiously.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi saw Lu Tingxiao looking at the card, so she glanced over curiously. She then saw a familiar handwriting. \"My dear, what's so great about the Golden Film Awards? Don't you think these are cuter? -YS\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi almost broke down.</p><br/><p>Well, when she had thought that it was some lunatic, she should already have thought about that guy!</p><br/><p>\"He's at it again\u2026\" Ning Xi felt a throbbing headache coming on. She closed the box of shiny gold. \"I'll get someone to send it back later.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

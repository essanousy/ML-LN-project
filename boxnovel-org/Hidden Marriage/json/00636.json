Since he thought she had no means of attacking now, he signaled for his men to grab her.</p><br/><p>As they moved, three gunshots were fired. Bang, bang, bang!</p><br/><p>Three men went down in just a second!</p><br/><p>The leader looked at his men, his expression turning pale.</p><br/><p>He saw Ning Xi was holding a gun with smoke coming out of it and she was now aiming at his head.</p><br/><p>\"You...didn\u2019t you throw your gun away\u2026\" The man looked at the gun on the floor in disbelief. It was still lying there.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes like she was looking at an idiot. \"Who told you I only had one gun?\"</p><br/><p>She had bought two!</p><br/><p>The leader was infuriated and cursed, \"F*CK! You cunning Asian!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re just too stupid,\" Ning Xi sneered at him, \"Who do you think is faster, you or I?\"</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s hand was trembling and sweat started to fall from his brow.</p><br/><p>He would not have been afraid if she was an average woman, but now he knew that this was Tang Xi!</p><br/><p>Rumour had it that she had the best gunmanship among the people around Satan\u2026</p><br/><p>She took advantage of the stress the man was going through and fired a shot when she had the chance. Bang!</p><br/><p>The man reacted swiftly. He avoided his vitals being shot at and was hit on his shoulder instead, his gun clattering onto the floor.</p><br/><p>That was good enough for her to escape. She did not want to stay there any longer and just wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was the sound of many footsteps pattering.</p><br/><p>Dozens and dozens of armed men surrounded her.</p><br/><p>The leader who was shot was smugly grinning at ease now as he respectfully walked towards a blond man with blue eyes and addressed, \"Boss!\"</p><br/><p>The blue-eyed man looked like the leader of everyone here. He expressionlessly glanced at the three bodies and his injured henchman.</p><br/><p>The man had fair skin and a tall nose, blue eyes and long blonde hair, but his ears looked a little weird\u2026</p><br/><p>A breeze blew and Ning Xi saw it clearly. The man had no ears\u2026</p><br/><p>The man then looked at the helpless Ning Xi, giving her a creepy look. He used a tone matching his twisted expression and taunted, \"Run, why don\u2019t you continue running? Don\u2019t you Chinese have a saying? You don\u2019t follow the path to the heavens, yet you barge into the doorless hell!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi cursed at herself while looking at all the men around her.</p><br/><p>What was wrong with them? Did they prepare these many men just to catch her? Did they think that they were fighting a mob boss or something?</p><br/><p>Philadelphia was their old spot, but their main forces were moved to some other city. It seemed like this place was now controlled by this blond man with blue eyes.</p><br/><p>She was now like a rat in a trap with no means to escape.</p><br/><p>What could she do?</p><br/><p>As she was thinking, the blond man advanced towards her slowly and looked at her suggestively. \"So, you\u2019re Satan\u2019s woman?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

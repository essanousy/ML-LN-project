Can you give me a way to contact her?\u201d Orlando said as he looked a little shy. \u201cCan you? I\u2019m sincere!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Right! You are sincere! You are sincere to every girl\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Ning Xi was still immersed in the shock that Orlando actually fancied Jiang Muye and did not say anything for a long time.</p><br/><p>Orlando thought that Ning Xi was worried and was already coming up with all sorts of excuses to persuade her. \u201cXi Xi! I swear! I\u2019m really sincere! She\u2019s beautiful! Earlier, when I saw her looking at me, her gaze was like lightning!\u201d</p><br/><p>What the heck was this lightning-like description?</p><br/><p>Earlier, Jiang Muye had been clearly shooting him a look of hostility.</p><br/><p>Uhh, to be fair, when Jiang Muye stared at people in his female disguise, it was indeed quite\u2026</p><br/><p>That little gaze was filled with an arrogant and unbridled wildness, which definitely could trigger all men\u2019s desires to conquer \u201cher\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a girl before! She\u2019s incredibly unique!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought to herself, \u201cOf course, you\u2019ve never seen such a person before because he isn\u2019t even a girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiXi, if I can\u2019t be with her, I\u2019ll definitely rather die than live! My life would have no meaning at all! Like a barren desert! Please, please help me?\u201d Orlando looked like his heart ached terribly as if he was about to die in the next second.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi expressed that she was in a tight spot</p><br/><p>This time, should she sell Blondie out, or sell Blondie out?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi contemplated for three seconds before she quickly nodded. \u201cOkay! This is her handphone number. The number is\u2026 Forget it, I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t remember. I\u2019ll just write it for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not hesitate as she quickly jotted Jiang Muye\u2019s phone number down at lightning speed and passed it to him.</p><br/><p>Orlando clutched that little slip of paper dreamily. \u201cXi Xi! Thank you! If we get married, you must join our wedding!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless. She almost puked three liters of blood.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell! This was just their first time meeting and he had already thought about marriage?</p><br/><p>She never would have thought that Jiang Muye in a female disguise could have such immense charm that even the veteran playboy Orlando was this crazy for him.</p><br/><p>Amazing, my blondie!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Jiang Muye who was in the changing room suddenly could not stop sneezing. \u201cHey! Who\u2019s cursing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, tsk, Little Junior Sister, you just stabbed your brother in the back with two knives just like that! Is that appropriate?\u201d Tang Lang who was waiting for Ning Xi in the car had just witnessed the scene earlier, and he expressed his amazement.</p><br/><p>This time, Tang Lang had gone along as a bodyguard with her to Lorraine. Every time Ning Xi had a shoot, he would follow. Obviously, he had seen Jiang Muye in a female disguise, so earlier when Orlando spoke, he already knew who the black rose Orlando was referring to.</p><br/><p>She had finally gotten rid of Orlando, so Ning Xi was in a jovial mood. She beamed. \u201cNo! I\u2019m clearly helping out a buddy. Hasn\u2019t Blondie been lacking confident about his female disguise? I\u2019m helping him regain confidence right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think he doesn\u2019t need this kind of things\u2026\u201d Tang Lang tsked with sympathy.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p></div>\n</div>"}

I have a favor to ask of you\u2026]</p><br/><p>At the same time, in a car factory under Lu Corporation.</p><br/><p>A group of top managers surrounded the big boss with a cold face in a black suit. The factory head was blabbering non-stop to introduce the high-tech equipment in the factory, and he was bragging about his accomplishments\u2026</p><br/><p>Halfway through, a phone rang, it sounded like a text message tone.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at the message, then he held up his hands to indicate he wanted some silence.</p><br/><p>The factory head was still talking until the deputy reminded him to stop.</p><br/><p>When they saw that their boss immediately made a call after receiving a text message, they looked at each other, could it be some emergency?</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ning Xi was anxious, unsure if Lu Tingxiao was busy or if she was troubling him\u2026</p><br/><p>A few seconds later, Lu Tingxiao called.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly picked up, \"Boss!\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, what\u2019s up?\"</p><br/><p>The managers standing beside Lu Tingxiao were shocked when he started to talk. Who did he call? Had his voice always been this gentle?</p><br/><p>\"Well, there\u2019s something I want to ask. Are you free to talk right now?\" Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\"Yeap, sure.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone near Lu Tingxiao was speechless\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Oh, I actually picked the script I want for my next project, but there wasn\u2019t anyone to verify for me. Second Master went on a holiday and we can\u2019t contact him at all, and I heard that he\u2019ll only be back only after three months\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao instantly understood, \"I\u2019m currently inspecting one of my car companies and I'm finishing up. You can wait for me at the company, I\u2019ll be back soon.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked again, the boss actually uttered so many words today\u2026</p><br/><p>The factory head was especially dumbfounded. He thought about how he had talked so much earlier and only received a monosyllable reply!</p><br/><p>Which was \"Mmm\".</p><br/><p>What did he mean by \"finishing up\"? He had a lot more yet to be reported!</p><br/><p>\"Ah...you\u2019re inspecting\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Yet you said that you were free?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly said, \"Okay then, I\u2019ll wait for you at the company!\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm,\" murmured Lu Tingxiao, he then looked at his personal assistant Cheng Feng and said, \"Make the arrangements for Xiao Fang to bring her directly into my office.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I\u2019ll do it right now!\" Cheng Feng had been by Lu Tingxiao\u2019s side for a long time, and he knew that the boss was speaking to Ms. Ning Xi when he used that tone. He quickly complied and made a phone call.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Secretary Fang, it's Cheng Feng!\"</p><br/><p>\"Assistant Cheng, anything I can help with?\"</p><br/><p>\"Later, Ms. Ning will go over to meet CEO Lu. Please bring her directly into his office.\"</p><br/><p>\"Uh, is it appropriate to bring her directly into the office? Assistant Cheng, are you sure it\u2019s not the meeting room?\" Secretary Fang wondered if Cheng Feng was mistaken since CEO Lu\u2019s office had a lot of classified documents. How could she just bring someone in without the master\u2019s presence?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

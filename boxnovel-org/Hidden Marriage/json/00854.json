Zhichen is still young and his personality is too straightforward. He wouldn\u2019t easily change his mind although I\u2019ve told him about it many times. He still won\u2019t change that attitude! His teacher mentioned that this trait of him is beneficial in academics, but it surely causes a big problem in his interpersonal relationships!\"</p><br/><p>Guan Rui rephrased Guan Zhichen\u2019s arrogance and mean attitude to persistence and straightforwardness.</p><br/><p>Lu Chongshan was still reeling from Little Treasure talking, but he understood that his surprise should be concealed carefully. If not, he would be indicating that he acknowledged Little Treasure was autistic, so he stayed calm on the surface.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s not a big deal, Bro Guan, Qingyu has to be responsible as well. His personality is exactly the same as his father's. They just don\u2019t like to talk, we rarely listen him talk at home as well. It\u2019s unavoidable that Zhichen would misunderstand.\" Lu Chongshan used this chance to clarify the public\u2019s suspicions and avoid any future misunderstandings based on Little Treasure\u2019s silence.</p><br/><p>As for Little Treasure\u2019s remark of Guan Zhichen's unworthiness, Lu Chongshan ignored it and did not intend to apologize.</p><br/><p>Great job! As expected of Lu Chongshan\u2019s grandson!</p><br/><p>\"Since it\u2019s a misunderstanding, it\u2019s good that it\u2019s cleared up now\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right! Many people just love to spread rumors, kids are too young to separate the truth from lies. It\u2019s not entirely his fault!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Some guests helped to clear up the awkward atmosphere as Guan Zhichen apologized under Guan Rui\u2019s harsh gaze.</p><br/><p>Lu Chongshan\u2019s anger disappeared because Little Treasure talked, so he generously let this matter off as he was feeling overjoyed that night.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Guan Ziyao was holding onto Yan Ruyi\u2019s arms and she apologized, \"Aunty, I\u2019m really sorry for tonight, we\u2019ve been pretty strict with Zhichen, but just like Little Treasure, he\u2019s been treated like the treasure of our family. It was his first time being slapped and he got too upset! That\u2019s why he said those harsh words, they aren\u2019t intentional...Aunty, don\u2019t take them personally!\"</p><br/><p>As Guan Ziyao talked, she beckoned Guan Zhichen over.</p><br/><p>Guan Zhichen looked down and hid the fire in his eyes. \"I\u2019m sorry, Grandmother Lu, it\u2019s my fault, it wasn\u2019t intentional\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Yan Ruyi looked at the red mark on his face and she sighed, \"It\u2019s okay now, don\u2019t blame yourself anymore, everything is cleared up now. Ziyao, quickly get him some ice! Your father used too much force!\"</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao was relieved as Yan Ruyi\u2019s tone softened. She brought Guan Zhichen away. The Lu family would not hold them responsible on the surface for this matter, but it would surely leave a scar inside them. She had to make her father behave himself in the time being\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

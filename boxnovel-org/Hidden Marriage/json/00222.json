I\u2019ve had a busy week and also it\u2019s my birthday weekend (Jun 26) so lots of family obligations. Working on getting these out as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>Shout out to our Patreon donators: Beadgirl and VioletKunoichi! I appreciate it!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Jiang Muye continued to be listless. He didn\u2019t regain his spirit until it was time to eat the food.</p><br/><p>At least Ning Xi was capable of making good food. It was just barbeque, but tasted so good when she made it.</p><br/><p>He noticed that Little Treasure was watching him very hard in addition to helping Ning Xi. He even personally handed him a plate full of meat.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye is simply flattered.</p><br/><p>And\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He found out that Ning Xi hadn\u2019t exaggerated.</p><br/><p>This guy is really good, it\u2019s so pleasing! It\u2019s no wonder Ning Xi spoiled him\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Really it\u2019s too unfair. It\u2019s just a simple genetic mutation but why did Lu Ting Xiao give birth to such a lovely son?</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye while eating his meat was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>Before every day, he had to see Lu Ting Xiao posting in the group message, showing off the love. Now it was his turn to show off.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye secretly laughed a few times, before sneakily grabbing his phone and took a picture of Ning Xi\u2019s back against the sun. he then posted it in the chat captioning it [Making waves! Autumn outing~]</p><br/><p>With Lu Ting Xiao eyesight, he would certainly recognize who\u2019s back it was!</p><br/><p>Soon the members began to comment:</p><br/><p>[Wow! She\u2019s on point ah! Just from seeing the back, it\u2019s clear that she is certainly beautiful! ]</p><br/><p>[Jiang Muye, you have no sense of responsibility! Give us a full look!]</p><br/><p>[Show us the front too! Don\u2019t be stingy!]</p><br/><p>[She looks very young? Is she an adult? Jiang Muye you better not be doing anything illegal?]</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After a while, Lu Jingli also came out:</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli: [Crying! Barbecue looks delicious! There are chicken wings, as well as grilled fish \u2026 \u2026 little bastard, you\u2019re eating delicious food and actually didn\u2019t call me, your uncle! ]</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli focus of attention was\u2026 \u2026 really is different from ordinary people</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After waiting for a long time, the person who he was really waiting for finally appeared. He quickly refreshed to view the latest information.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye hurriedly clicked to see Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s reply. When he saw the results, his face just turned black\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao reply was one sentence: [Do not let Little Treasure eat too much, he\u2019s been a bit overweight recently.]</p><br/><p>Fuck! How did Lu Ting Xiao know that Little Treasure was there?</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye repeatedly looked at the picture until he finally found where the problem was.</p><br/><p>In the photo, reflected in the river is the image of Little Treasure\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>What great eyes! His eyes are too good!</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye forced into failure, like a defeated rooster who dubly ran back.</p><br/><p>He then looks over and sees Ning Xi is on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that on the phone?\u201d Jiang Muye casually asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Zhizhi ah ~\u201d Ning Xi answered in a slightly familiar tone. Ning Xi had replaced the more formal Lin Zhizhi and now called her Zhizhi called her sister Zhizhi</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye drank his fruit juice, \u201cWhat a sharp change!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy agent is Lin Zhizhi! What difference does it make?\u201d Ning Xi replied</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye immediately spewed out all the juice he drank, \u201cWho did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Zhizhi, Leng Manyun\u2019s old agent! Did you not see my press conference? Your reaction shouldn\u2019t be this slow\u201d Ning Xi said, looking at him disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what the resultsare, you ass! Lin Zhizhi, why is your agent Lin Zhizhi?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was already upset knowing that Ning Xi signed onto Golden Age. But he only casually understood the situation. He didn\u2019t bother to see who Lu Ting Xiao actually assigned as an agent. He didn\u2019t expect that it would be such a big bomb!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi puzzled, \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be Lin Zhizhi? Why are you so excited? Is she your ex-girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

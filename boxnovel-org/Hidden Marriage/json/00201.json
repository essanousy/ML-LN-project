She sat on the bed after tucking the little bun into his quilt.</p><br/><p>The little bun immediately grabbed the colorful fairytale book that he looked at with contempt before with his small hand and handed it to Ning Xi to read.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue from where we left off last night?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>The small bun clinging to her gave a well behaved nod.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, today we will read the story of the polite little rabbit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi cleared her throat and began telling the story to the little bun,</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the hot summer, the birds and the trees shouted: It\u2019s hot! The beautiful little white rabbit wearing a pretty floral skirt, was humming a song, and bouncing along a bridge. It was on its way across to go find some mushrooms\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi read the story, Lu Ting Xiao sat next to her on the chair supporting his head and quietly listened to her soft, sweet voice.</p><br/><p>He seemed to understand why his son insisted on listening to such childish content before going to sleep every night.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not the story\u2019s content, but rather who read the story.</p><br/><p>Less than five minutes into the story, the little bun had fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to trouble you\u201d Lu Ting Xiao said thankfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble.\u201d Ning Xi said, and looked conflicted she continued, \u201cLu Ting Xiao, did you know I used to hate children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded, but did not reveal the real reason, \u201cAnyway, I used to think that children were annoying. I wanted to hide every time I saw them\u2026\u2026.but I never knew that I would actually like the little bun. I\u2019m not really clear when I developed this feeling, but I feel comfortable with him. Like we have a special connection, or maybe it is fate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao looked deeply into her eyes, \u201cIn this world, nothing is impossible. Only situations that you haven\u2019t met yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to go back to sleep, boss you also have to rest!\u201d Ning Xi nervously replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201dLu Ting Xiao replied. Then suddenly he leaned towards her. Ning Xi was shocked, and subconsciously backed away to hide. Lu Ting Xiao seeing this, moved quickly past her face, leaned over and kissed the little bun behind her and whispered, \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Late at night, Ning Xi was drowsy and half asleep. She dreamt that Lu Ting Xiao sat beside her, kissed her on the lips, and said \u201cGoodnight, I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Well this was obviously a dream, it had to be a dream. But why did it feel so real?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time in the Pearl River Apartments.</p><br/><p>It was late at night but Ning Xuelo\u2019s apartment was still brightly lit, filled to the brim with an oppressive atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Chang Li and Cui Caijing are sitting on the corner of the sofa , unable to utter a cry due to the atmosphere. Since things developed to this point, who wouldn\u2019t be angry at this time. Who thought that after Ning Xi was swept out, she would gain favor and sign onto Golden Age Entertainment.</p><br/><p>If she had signed with any other company, it would be easy enough for Starlight Entertainment to block them. But it just had to be that company! In front of Golden Age, Starlight Entertainment\u2019s ban order was nothing but a joke.</p><br/><p>Chang Li wanted to comfort Ning Xuelo and say that with Ning Xi\u2019s reputation now, even Starlight couldn\u2019t get her out of trouble. But she couldn\u2019t say those words. After all even Lu Ting Xiao came out to support her!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

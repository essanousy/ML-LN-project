He doesn't even know he was helping his daughter by going up to him so quickly!\"</p><br/><p>\"Great, we tried for so long and now he's getting everything!\"</p><br/><p>\"What a lucky man!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Yun Shen was listening to Ning Yaohua patiently, making some comments and replies from time to time.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua was ecstatic as he inquired after that, \"What do you think, CEO Yun?\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu was enjoying the looks of jealousy from everyone else, feeling really proud of her husband. Even Ning Xueluo forgot about Ning Xi at that moment, focusing on the man with white hair in front of her.</p><br/><p>If this project were to happen, it would be a big step for Ning International.

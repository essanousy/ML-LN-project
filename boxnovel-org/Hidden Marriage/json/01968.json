Even if it were the most famous artiste in the country right now, there was no way they would know Jace.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I know him? I only met him when I went for the audition, but we kind of hit it off when we chatted and he decided on my character there and then,\u201d said Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAudition? Ahh, right, I haven\u2019t asked you what\u2019s your role yet!\u201d Jiang Muye exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAssassin,\u201d retorted Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye instantly gaped in shock. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re playing the female lead, Anna?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi expected that Jiang Muye would react like this. She held her chin with a hazy look in her eyes. \u201cI felt like I was dreaming too\u2026 I heard that they had initially decided on Lilian internally\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye did not know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>Such a classic Hollywood movie such as \u201cAssassin\u201d would use a Chinese female star to play the female lead?!</p><br/><p>Something like this had never happened before.</p><br/><p>Forget about \u201cAssassin\u201d, even if it was just a normal Hollywood movie, there were very scarce important roles that would be given to Chinese artistes.</p><br/><p>Especially knowing that Ning Xi had replaced Lilian, Jiang Muye surrendered himself in admiration.</p><br/><p>Lilian was currently Hollywood\u2019s youngest persona who was a great actress. She was also one of the hottest artistes in Hollywood and her status went without saying. The big shots in \u201cAssassin\u201d had initially decided on Lilian to be the female lead, yet Ning Xi had now replaced her. In fact, it had been decided by his super idol, Jace\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye raised his brows with a subtle expression. \u201cTsk, Han Zixuan and Zheng Anru\u2019s people have been bragging with great fanfare, saying that Han Zixuan has successfully joined the \u2018Assassin\u2019 filming crew and will even act in the movie. I\u2019m afraid that they wouldn\u2019t have dreamt that you\u2019d be the female lead in \u2018Assassin\u2019 now!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Zheng Anru and Han Zixuan\u2019s faces would probably be slapped swollen by Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMission complete! I\u2019m leaving. If you need a female outfit, you can look for me!\u201d Ning Xi smirked happily.</p><br/><p>When he thought about wearing a female outfit, Jiang Muye\u2019s excitement instantly turned incredibly dour.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell, why did he still feel like he had been tricked?</p><br/><p>After leaving the villa, Ning Xi drove back to Deer Town.</p><br/><p>When she thought about those few days of being with the tiger, Ning Xi\u2019s heart was about to melt.</p><br/><p>Thus, she could not help but call Han Xiao in hopes that he would bring the tiger over for her to stroke.</p><br/><p>Sadly, Han Xiao\u2019s phone was switched off, so she could not get through.</p><br/><p>The Master did indeed appear and disappear unpredictably\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A week later, almost all of the well-known entertainment media in the country had rushed to a certain shooting location for \u201cAssassin\u201d in Imperial.</p><br/><p>Today the film crew was hosting a press conference to announce their decision on the actors for the respective roles.</p><br/><p>China\u2019s super A-list female star, Han Zixuan, had successfully made it into the \u201cAssassin\u201d team and was even acting in the movie. Naturally, all the media wanted to get first-hand information and interview her along the way.</p><br/><p>At the temporary base of the movie, King Weir appeared for the first time.</p><br/><p>He wore a black tuxedo, which complemented his lean figure very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cKing Weir!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God, he\u2019s so handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>When they saw King Weir himself, many of the media were instantly bowled over him.</p><br/><p>King Weir himself was even more dashing in person than on camera.</p><br/><p>After he came out to greet everyone, he left quickly.</p><br/><p>After that, Lilian and some of the other top actors in Hollywood came out to show their faces too. They politely answered a few questions from the Chinese media before returning to the crew.</p><br/><p>About half an hour later, Han Zixuan had brought two assistants along, and with Zheng Anru, they appeared within the media\u2019s line of sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Han Zixuan, may we know how did you manage to get a role in the movie \u2018Assassin\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

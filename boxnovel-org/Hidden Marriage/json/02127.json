This is my repayment. If there\u2019s a next time\u2026\u201d A strong sense of bloodlust oozed out from Annie\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a small medical pouch fell out of her hand.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi extended her hand and the medical pouch tumbled right into her palm.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the pouch. \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie laughed coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. It\u2019s not quite the antidote. It\u2019s just medicine to delay the symptoms.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then turned around and left!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was surprised, then she yelled, \u201cWill you really give me the antidote if someone beat you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go back on my promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie then disappeared at the end of the corridor\u2026</p><br/><p>At almost the exact moment Annie disappeared from her eyes, like a collapsing tower, Ning Xi fell over.</p><br/><p>She fell into a warm embrace\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked up saw the man with a worried expression on his face. She smiled faintly. \u201cThank you, darling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s body was trembling. How he wished he could embrace her tightly, yet he was controlling his strength like he was holding a fragile glassware. \u201cJust this once!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d The girl nodded, then the aura she had moments ago was all gone.</p><br/><p>She knew that she definitely could not take the third blow from Annie, but she was betting that Annie would not kill her.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she won the bet.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Lu Tingxiao believed in her.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen was boiling mad. \u201cYou pair of maniacs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, give these to Little Treasure!\u201d Ning Xi wanted to go into the ward.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang quickly took the medical pouch from Ning Xi. \u201cMy Grandfather Xi, let me call you my grandfather! Don\u2019t move around. I\u2019ll do it! I\u2019m so done with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes brightened slightly when she heard the ever so familiar term of \u201cgrandfather\u201d from Tang Lang. She slowly took out a silver whistle from her pocket and whispered, \u201cThis might be the Little Treasure\u2019s last chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen glanced at the whistle. \u201cIs this the Insect Whistle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an Insect Whistle?\u201d Ning Xi had no idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn insect is usually inside the whistle. Offspring are placed inside a specially designed whistle. The insect will get up whenever it\u2019s blown, sending a message to the mother insect, letting her know the position of the offspring,\u201d Yun Shen explained, \u201cOld methods like this have been abandoned eight hundred years ago. Taking so much time to design this, you might as well just buy a GPS system!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had no words to say.</p><br/><p>However, this was not just a whistle to her. It was an important item signifying the favor Han Xiao owed her, a life repayment.</p><br/><p>Finally, Ning Xi blew the whistle. She then lost all her strength and fell unconscious\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was already the next morning when Ning Xi woke up.</p><br/><p>She felt torture all over her body. \u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s painful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was sitting on a sofa opposite her crunching on an apple. He heard her voice from the bed. \u201cWhat are you whining for?! Feng Xiaoxiao broke two bones, First Senior Brother got three broken, and I got six broken! You didn\u2019t even break any! Not even any internal damage! Just some lung bleeding! I haven\u2019t even started complaining! Shut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi then touched her chest area, her eyes seeming gentle.</p></div>\n</div>"}

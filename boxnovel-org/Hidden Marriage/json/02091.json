Ning Xi! I\u2019m going to kill you! I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was stunned for a whole second, then she screeched. She had not even been this crazy when she saw the evidence just now.</p><br/><p>She stopped trusting people ever since the people from Solomon kept on failing her. Furthermore, she was uneasy about hiring someone within the country too as the consequences would be dire if Ning Xi found out.</p><br/><p>Which was why she had decided to do it herself this time.</p><br/><p>It was her first time, after all, so she was pretty anxious about it. She had really been freaking out when she was destroying the clothes and the motorbike. Of course, she could not remember that many details at that moment. Moreover, Ning Xi\u2019s video looked so real that she believed it when she saw those familiar scenes.</p><br/><p>As for the fingerprints and blood samples, she might still have doubted it if Ning Xi had taken it out herself, but it was from Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had handed them over to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>With Lu Tingxiao\u2019s power, he could turn the impossible into possible.</p><br/><p>She had believed it almost instantly!</p><br/><p>She never expected that she had fallen into Ning Xi\u2019s trap from the very beginning!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had been bluffing from the start. The video was fake, and so were the fingerprints and blood samples!</p><br/><p>This witch! Witch!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi watched Ning Xueluo who just kept on screaming. \u201cI told you it\u2019s fake, but you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was totally impressed by what he just saw.</p><br/><p>So sick!</p><br/><p>What a drama! Plot twists all around! A huge production! And in the end, she just had to show everyone how lovey-dovey they were with those church pictures\u2026</p><br/><p>However, things were not over yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile those are fake, I have something real with me.\u201d Ning Xi tapped her phone and then projected an A4 paper onto the wall.</p><br/><p>Under closer inspection, it was a DNA report.</p><br/><p>The report indicated that the child in Ning Xueluo\u2019s womb had no blood relation to Su Yan at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-this is a DNA report!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a DNA report of Xueluo\u2019s child with Su Yan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God! Xueluo\u2019s child isn\u2019t Su Yan\u2019s?\u201d</p><br/><p>People were making a fuss in the room.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at Ning Xueluo. \u201cA tiger would never hurt its child no matter how fierce it is. I\u2019m pretty sure you understand how important the child was to you, Ms. Ning, so I\u2019ve been wondering why you\u2019d frame me by killing your child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a pause, but she soon continued, \u201cI thought about it and it only led to one conclusion, that is\u2026 this child cannot exist. Then, what\u2019s the reason for it? That\u2019s really worth considering, am I right, Ms. Ning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it had just been two days, she had done a lot of work.</p><br/><p>She had people investigate the tapes of Zhuang Lingyu being hit. She tracked the motorbike\u2019s movement, and then investigated Ning Xueluo\u2019s activities in the past few months.</p><br/><p>She then visited the racer personally and asked the special effects artist from \u201cThunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u201d for help.</p><br/><p>Besides, she also had people secretly take Su Yan\u2019s hair and the dead child\u2019s blood to conduct a DNA test.</p><br/><p>The test results were only sent to her about half an hour ago in her inbox. Everything was as she expected. Ning Xueluo\u2019s child was not Su Yan\u2019s.</p></div>\n</div>"}

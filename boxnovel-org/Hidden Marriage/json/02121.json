Even Yun Shen did not expect this as well.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mouth was wide open as she stared at the face in the picture. She could not say anything.</p><br/><p>Annie\u2026</p><br/><p>How could it be Annie!?</p><br/><p>However, the girl in the frame looked young and almost no different from Annie. All of them recognized her in one glance.</p><br/><p>Annie had a small frame. She was skilled in healthcare and was an expert at skin care. She never really changed ever since Ning Xi knew her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi never expected that after spending so much time to recover the security footage, it would reveal such jaw-dropping information to her!</p><br/><p>Before this, she had imagined countless possibilities and guesses, and Annie was never a part of any of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-this is impossible! It cannot be my cute Annie!\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao swiftly snatched the phone away from Lu Tingxiao and played the video again.</p><br/><p>No matter how many times she played it, it still showed the ever-so-familiar face of the little sister everyone loved, Annie.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Boss, are you sure this is reliable?\u201d Tang Lang scratched his head.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not say a word, but his expression answered the question for him.</p><br/><p>He had personally led a team of professionals to work on the video for two weeks to recover it, so there was no way it could be a mistake.</p><br/><p>As everyone was shocked by the results\u2026</p><br/><p>The door of the elevators at the end of the corridor opened and the pattering of footsteps came closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The cute little girl wore a cotton dress and she called out to Ning Xi when she saw her, walking swiftly towards their direction.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s back straightened when she saw Annie.</p><br/><p>The expressions on Tang Lang, Tang Ye, and Feng Xiaoxiao\u2019s faces changed. Tang Lang unconsciously stepped forward and stood before Ning Xi, putting up a defensive stance.</p><br/><p>Annie noticed that something was not right. She paused a few steps before Ning Xi, her eyes seeming hesitant. \u201cBro Xi, Bro Ye, Sis Xiaoxiao\u2026 What\u2019s wrong? Oh, Bro Xi, who\u2019s sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang and Feng Xiaoxiao looked at each other in the eyes.</p><br/><p>Tang Ye pursed his lips, having no idea what to say.</p><br/><p>No one said a word as an odd silence crept over the corridor.</p><br/><p>Then, Lu Tingxiao took his phone back from Feng Xiaoxiao before going to Annie and handing the phone to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Lu?\u201d Annie took the phone and then looked at it.</p><br/><p>The footage of the hospital morgue was rolling\u2026</p><br/><p>When Annie looked at it, she saw the exact moment the person turned around.</p><br/><p>At the exact moment, the expression of this cute little girl changedin front of all of them\u2026</p><br/><p>She still had that innocent and naive face, yet the expression on her face was sheer chilly.

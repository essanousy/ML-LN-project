In a short amount of time, it would cause a reaction that could destroy the whole Chinese economy.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had goosebumps all over him as he had these thoughts.</p><br/><p>It was surely a conspiracy!</p><br/><p>Not just the Lu Corporation, several other powerful organizations faced a similar fate as the Lu Corporation. It was exactly the same circumstances!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis means that we are not the only target. The opponent wants to control the economy of the whole of Asia?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli stared at Lu Tingxiao in horror.</p><br/><p>A huge amount of underground forces hid behind the economy of Asia. If the Asian economy was destroyed, handling the underground forces would be extremely easy. Whether it was to disband them or to use them, it would not be a difficult task.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust who could it be? I thought it was that Yun bastard again, but now that I think about it, that guy couldn\u2019t have gone this far!\u201d Lu Jingli\u2019s brain was going haywire.</p><br/><p>After a while, Lu Tingxiao blurted out two words, \u201cEuropean King.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was shocked when he heard those two words. \u201cDamn\u2026 Seriously? We\u2019re not even related in any way. What does that old guy want, stepping over his boundaries? And I feel that he\u2019s especially against us this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>If the Lu Corporation could hang in there, the current situation could still be controlled. However, once the Lu Corporation fell, the consequences would be catastrophic.</p><br/><p>The powerful organizations in the country would surely fall along with the Lu Corporation like a stack of dominos.</p><br/><p>It was worrisome enough to have Yun Shen around, then this external enemy had stormed right in\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At night, in a certain old house in Imperial.</p><br/><p>In the dark came the cold voice of the white-haired man, \u201cYou\u2019re really lucky, aren\u2019t you, Uncle Qiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Qiao\u2019s expression was unusually calm when facing this person who had abandoned his duty for revenge and for his family. \u201cShen, you\u2019ve been too obsessed. That woman bewitched you, so I can forgive you just this once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Yun Shen laughed as if he had just heard a joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you your last chance now. Work together with me. This is our only chance at overturning the Lu family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen gazed upon the man. \u201cIt seems that your patron is pretty powerful this time. Why do you still need me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Yi was angered by his indifferent tone. \u201cBastard! Your mother is not avenged yet! And you\u2019re here wasting your time. Think about it. What have you done in the past year?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Yun Shen\u2019s eyes brightened a little.</p><br/><p>He did not really do anything in the past year, yet it was the time that he felt the most alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to get you out of your slump!\u201d Qiao Yi sounded determined.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen guffawed. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that I might betray you and help Lu Tingxiao, in the end ruining all your plans?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to?!\u201d Qiao Yi was frustrated when Yun Shen mentioned the one sensitive thing.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen raised his eyebrows. \u201cWith your powerful patron around, does anything I do make a difference?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood that you know! No matter what, the Lu family have to die this time! If you work with me, I can pretend that all those things from before never happened!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

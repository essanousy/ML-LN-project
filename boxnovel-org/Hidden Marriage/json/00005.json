All of them had expressions showing that disaster was about to fall upon them.</p><br/><p>Because the Lu Corporation\u2019s little prince, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s precious son, had gone missing in their bar.</p><br/><p>On the sofa, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face was chilly as always; not a single shred of extra feeling was showing on that ice statue. However, the pressure of a superior was pressing on each person present, causing their legs to soften and their sweat to fall like the rain. No one dared to utter a single word.</p><br/><p>A young man was kneeling by his feet, face full of tears and snot, \u201cBrother, I\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s all my fault! I shouldn\u2019t have brought Little Treasure to a bar! If anything happens to Little Treasure, then I won\u2019t live any longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished speaking, a kick was thrown at his chest.</p><br/><p>The sound of bone breaking made their scalps tingle, everyone present shook a little.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli clutched at his chest and coughed fiercely for a while, before immediately crawling back up and kneeling with a straight back again.</p><br/><p>Their parents were still overseas on holiday, and have not heard that Little Treasure was lost. If they were to find out, then it would not be settled with a simple kick from his older brother, he could even be flayed alive.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s heart was currently like dead ashes; completely ashamed. Suddenly, a knock sounded on the door of the reception room.</p><br/><p>The boss, who was the closest to the door, opened it. Seeing that there was no one at the door, he was still wondering about it when he bent his head, and was stunned: \u201cLittle\u2026. Little young master!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure\u2026\u2026? Heavens! Little Treasure! Second Uncle\u2019s precious baby! Where did you run off to?\u201d Lu Jingli crawled up from the ground to embrace the little guy tightly, he was so emotional that he burst into tears.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room held an expression of having survived death.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao walked a few steps to the door, then grabbed Lu Jingli\u2019s collar to throw him away. He squatted down in front of his son, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>After finally getting out of the clutches of his second uncle, Little Treasure grabbed onto Lu Tingxiao\u2019s hand, anxiously trying to tug him outside.</p><br/><p>Just as Lu Tingxiao got closer to his son, he smelled the strong scent of alcohol from his body. There was also a hint of a subtle fragrance, not the pungent smell of a perfume, but more like a flower that had bloomed on a glacier. The cool fragrance was inexplicably familiar to him, to the point that his heart skipped a beat for a moment.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Lu Tingxiao was not moving, Little Treasure pointed in a certain direction, anxiously making hoarse \u2018huh huh\u2019 sounds from his throat.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao picked up his son, and headed straight in the direction that his son was pointing in.</p><br/><p>The people behind him, including Lu Jingli, saw that something was up and exchanged gazes before following.</p><br/><p>Five minutes later, the group of people stopped in front of a storeroom on the top floor.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure twisted his body and dropped down from his father\u2019s body, and beat at the storeroom\u2019s door with all his strength, looking extremely anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure, what\u2019s happening? What\u2019s inside?\u201d Lu Jingli was confused.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao ordered expressionlessly: \u201cOpen the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes yes!\u201d The boss of the bar nodded his head, then turned to scold the female manager at his side, \u201cManager Ye, what are you waiting for? Quickly open the door! Where\u2019s the key?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 O-Open the door?\u201d The female manager was stunned.</p><br/><p>Oh no! That woman, Ning Xi, was still locked in there! She promised Chang Li to keep her at least until the audition was over!</p><br/><p>However, with these two gods from the Lu family and the boss waiting, how could she possibly refuse? She could only tremble and pull out the key to open the door.</p><br/><p>Once the door was opened, a woman lying unconscious on the floor came into view.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is there a woman in there?\u201d The boss raged.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know! There wasn\u2019t anyone in there when I last checked!\u201d The female manager suppressed the guilt in her heart and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly! Just save that person first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as someone attempted to get close to Ning Xi, Little Treasure immediately threw himself onto Ning Xi\u2019s body. His little face held a ferocious expression, not letting anyone near.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

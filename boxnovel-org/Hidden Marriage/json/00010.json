Your Little Treasure was just fine a while ago, but he suddenly started going on a rampage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened either. After he woke up, he was searching everywhere for someone. I thought that he might be searching for Ning Xi, so I told him to stop looking, the pretty lady had already left. As soon as I finished talking, he started his rampage. Little Treasure seems to like Ning Xi a lot, but it shouldn\u2019t be to the point where he would get this agitated by just hearing that she left!\u201d</p><br/><p>Also, it had been a long time since Little Treasure had shown such intense and turbulent emotions.</p><br/><p>After hearing what had happened, Lu Tingxiao walked straight towards his son.</p><br/><p>Seeing Lu Tingxiao come closer, the little guy immediately retreated backwards warily. His eyes were filled with caution and aversion, he wasn\u2019t going to stop, even for his own father.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stopped when he was three steps away from his son. He said in a calm and steady tone: \u201cWhen your second uncle told you that the lady had already left, that was exactly what he meant. There was nothing wrong with her health, so she has already left the hospital to go home. She didn\u2019t die, it\u2019s not like when your grandmother left and never came back, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was perhaps only when facing his son that Lu Tingxiao would have such patience, having so much to say.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli gaped, \u201cAre you kidding me? I only said those two words, \u2018she left\u2019, and his mind made such a huge leap?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bao had personally seen Ning Xi fall down and had already experienced a big fright. Under such emotional turmoil, he couldn\u2019t be blamed for misunderstanding the situation.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure briefly stopped screaming after hearing Lu Tingxiao\u2019s explanation. He refused to move while burying his head and curling up on the windowsill.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Lu Tingxiao took out a slip of paper, \u201cShe left this for you, are you going to look at it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure\u2019s body twitched once, as if a switch had been turned on. He quickly raised his head and opened his little arms, indicating that he wanted his father to hug him.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctors and nurses at the scene: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room had been put through the wringer to the point of breaking down, yet Lu Tingxiao managed to end the matter with a slip of paper?</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had originally thought that asking Ning Xi for a note was entirely unnecessary, but now he was completely convinced.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao carried his son to the sofa and sat down, then handed the paper slip to him.</p><br/><p>The little guy eagerly received it. He had learned to recognize words a long time ago, and could already read on his own.</p><br/><p>[Darling, thank you for saving me, you\u2019re amazing XOXO~]</p><br/><p>Looking at the words on the slip, and the heart drawn at the end of it, the little guy\u2019s eyes were sparkling. He even had a faint blush on his cheeks. Even though he tightened his lips reservedly, the corners of his mouth could not resist faintly quirking up. His demeanor was especially cute.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli looked as if he had just seen a ghost. \u201cWhat the ****, was I just blinded? Our Little Treasure actually smiled! I can\u2019t even remember how long it\u2019s been since I last saw him smile! What exactly did Ning Xi write?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli wanted to sneak a peek, but Little Treasure immediately hid it like it was a precious treasure.</p><br/><p>However, Lu Jingli\u2019s sharp eyes had already seen it. It was just a fairly ordinary note, yet it could make Little Treasure so happy? This Ning Xi was remarkable!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao gazed warmly at his son without speaking.</p><br/><p>After Little Treasure had woken up, Lu Tingxiao immediately brought him home. In addition, he postponed all his work at the company to stay with Little Treasure at home.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At night, in Platinum Palace\u2019s villa No. 8.</p><br/><p>The huge living room was icy cold. An adult and a child sat facing each other across the dining table with matching cold expressions. </p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cEat your food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure turned a deaf ear.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cI\u2019m saying this for the last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure didn\u2019t even twitch.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cDo you think that this kind of childish hunger strike would work against me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was like a meditating old monk, completely immersed in his own world, isolated from the outside world.</p><br/><p>The duo continued to confront one another.</p><br/><p>After one hour.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao called Lu Jingli: \u201cSend me Ning Xi\u2019s address.\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay, so this had proved that hunger strikes did work on him.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was extremely efficient as he immediately sent Ning Xi\u2019s exact address to his older brother\u2019s cell phone. Following that was a huge pile of gossip, which was completely ignored by Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>This time, Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t even need to say anything. The moment Little Treasure saw his father picking up his jacket and car keys, he immediately followed his father\u2019s every step.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao helplessly picked up his son after a single glance at the little bun standing by his feet, \u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

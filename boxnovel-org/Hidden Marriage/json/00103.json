You can\u2019t let the grudge between the two of you affect the company! The only thing we can do now is to minimise the damage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked calmly at Ning Xueluo, who appeared to be trying to protect the company, and said, \u201cSenior, if I remember correctly, it was Jia Qingqing who was always against me and she was the one who kept trying to slander me. I always kept Chang-jie\u2019s teachings in mind and tried not to embarrass the company, putting the company before myself. I endured it and remained silent. Even when I was slandered, I didn\u2019t dare to trouble the company and I was only able to clear my reputation when some kind-hearted netizens and colleagues stepped out for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only matter that the netizens and fans are protesting about now is regarding Jia Qingqing being kept as a mistress. Wasn\u2019t it clearly Jia Qingqing who acted for her own interests without thinking about the company? She even framed an artiste in the same company and ruined the company\u2019s image as a result. Don\u2019t tell me that Senior means to say that if a mad dog falls into a ditch and dies while chasing you, then it\u2019s your fault?\u201d</p><br/><p>If she tweeted about forgiving Jia Qingqing, then the reputation she had spent so much effort to clean would take a turn for the dumps again.</p><br/><p>Forgiving someone like Jia Qingqing when the crowd was out for her blood; did she seriously take her for a fool?</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo almost choked to death on Ning Xi\u2019s words. What kind-hearted netizens? She was clearly the one who had leaked that video. She had some nerve to be able to say that so calmly and innocently.</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing, who had just settled down not too long ago, immediately got agitated again, \u201cNing Xi, who are you calling a mad dog! Say it clearly! You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Jia Qingqing was about to make a ruckus again, Feng Haoyang interrupted her: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to post an apology anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jia Qingqing\u2019s expression immediately turned to joy, but Feng Haoyang continued: \u201cQingqing, just write a letter explaining that you are going to retire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing screamed, \u201cWhy? You\u2019re making me retire from the entertainment circle? Why must I be the one retiring! I\u2019m not going to write that letter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Haoyang\u2019s expression showed impatience, \u201cBy letting you write it yourself, I\u2019m already giving you some dignity! Don\u2019t throw this favour back in my face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being kept! In the entertainment industry, so many female stars have sponsors behind them, and so many of them are mistresses. Why do I have to retire!\u201d Jia Qingqing couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly you were stupid enough to let it spread to the public!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat had nothing to do with me, it was all because that bitch Han Ying betrayed me! Why don\u2019t you go and investigate her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to investigate her when she has already resigned? Han Ying was the most even-tempered manager in this whole company. Ask yourself, other than her, who else could bear with your temper? It\u2019s fine if you keep shouting at her and making a big fuss, but when her son had a high fever and she needed to go to the hospital, you refused to let her go. Eventually, by the time she rushed to the hospital at midnight, her son had to go into the ICU because he took a turn for the worse. He is still in critical condition right now!\u201d Feng Yaohang listed her shortcomings one after another. It wasn\u2019t just Han Ying, but even he was sick of cleaning up after Jia Qingqing\u2019s reckless actions.</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Jia Qingqing still didn\u2019t feel like she had done anything wrong. Conversely, she said indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s not like he died in the end! There are doctors there for that kind of situation, what difference would it have made even if she had gone! Is it really worth pushing me into this hole?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even up to now, Jia Qingqing still didn\u2019t understand why the normally weak Han Ying would suddenly do something like this. She had divorced with her husband and her son was sickly. He needed a large amount of medical fees every month. Without this job, how was she going to pay for all that?</p><br/><p>She would never have guessed that someone like Liang Feixing would personally take action against such a small fry like her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

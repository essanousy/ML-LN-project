All sorts of ingredients were available in her fridge. In fact, it was enough to prepare a steamboat feast anytime.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao naturally took over the vegetables from her and helped to wash them. Ning Xi looked at him and helped to roll his sleeves up for him.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli felt like he was the largest third wheel in the world at that moment, so he stayed in the living room and watched television alone.</p><br/><p>The ingredients were soon prepared, the steamboat soup base emitting an aromatic smell which was extremely tempting.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli could not wait anymore, so he rushed to the table and saw that the pot was separated into two sections - one contained clear soup base and the other was a piquant spicy soup. Lu Jingli was confused. \"Xiao Xi Xi, why did you make two soup bases?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your brother doesn\u2019t eat spicy food,\" she replied while setting up the table.</p><br/><p>\"Oh!\" Lu Jingli bit on the chopsticks, then asked again, \"Xiao Xi Xi! Do you like my brother?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi choked as she was drinking some water, almost biting her own tongue. She then nervously looked at Lu Tingxiao. \"What are you talking about!\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, you\u2019ve been treating my brother exceptionally well!\" Lu Jingli mumbled.</p><br/><p>\"Would there be any subordinate who doesn\u2019t want to please their boss? Don\u2019t think too much about it, alright? If you\u2019re accusing me again, I\u2019m going to give you a good beating!\" Ning Xi handed Lu Tingxiao a pair of chopsticks after she clarified herself, \"Boss, don\u2019t listen to him! I\u2019m always loyal to you and will never have weird thoughts about you.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao took the chopsticks from her and looked at her, \"I don\u2019t mind.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli and Ning Xi were speechless.</p><br/><p>After some munching, Lu Jingli patted his stomach in satisfaction, having gained his strength to start gossiping again. \"Xiao Xi Xi, can I ask you a question?\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"How do you feel...about Su Yan?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s hand twitched a little as he was serving Ning Xi some vegetables.</p><br/><p>\"How do I feel?\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, I\u2019m asking if you still can\u2019t get over him! Why must you make me say it so clearly?!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes. \"Do you think it\u2019s possible?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli bit his chopsticks again. \"Why not? First love...is usually the most unforgettable one isn\u2019t it?\"</p><br/><p>He then glanced at his brother. Ning Xi was his brother\u2019s first love!</p><br/><p>Why did everyone think she still could not get over Su Yan? First , it was Ning Tianxin and now Lu Jingli!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi munched on a roasted potato and said in dissatisfaction, \"The world is so huge that it contains so many hot guys out there. I\u2019m not the shy little girl I was back then. There\u2019s no point staying on a tree when a jungle is waiting for me, alright? I already have someone I like in mind!\"</p><br/><p>Both Lu Jingli and Lu Tingxiao straightened their backs at full attention.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli would never let this chance pass, so he quickly followed up. \"I\u2019ve heard about it before, then who is it? What does he look like? Is he more handsome than I am? What kind of man could steal Bro Xi\u2019s heart away? Quickly tell me!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was annoyed by Lu Jingli\u2019s excitement, \"Let me think\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Quickly!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao sat there in silence, not wanting to continue listening, but he could not leave, even though he knew that the answer was going to hurt him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

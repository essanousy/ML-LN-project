The wife has already said herself that back then, Ning Xi had been adoring and lusting after Su Yan. She\u2019s been conspiring to go after Su Yan! If these two people don\u2019t have any secrets between them, why would Su Yan suddenly push his wife out of the company? In fact, the first thing he does after taking over is to poach Ning Xi.]</p><br/><p>[Who\u2019s the one deaf here!? I think some people aren\u2019t just blind. In fact, they\u2019re brainless! Ning Xueluo already said herself that it\u2019s because she\u2019s pregnant. So, to let her rest at ease, Su Yan let her step down from Starlight!</p><br/><p>The poaching thing was only brought up by Han Zixuan herself. How do we know that Han Zixuan wasn\u2019t intentionally inciting things and wanting to get Ning Xueluo to help her go against Ning Xi?</p><br/><p>Our Bro Xi is clearly staying in Glory World perfectly all right. Her work recently has been coming in non-stop!]</p><br/><p>[Han Zixuan\u2019s been crushed by our Bro Xi so tragically. Clearly, she can\u2019t win, so she just started to hinder her behind her back! Otherwise, why would she meet up with Ning Xueluo and even specially record that in secret? Obviously, she was prepared from the start! How can you trust the words of someone like this?]</p><br/><p>[Our Bro Xi has been slandered since she made her debut. She\u2019s seen too much of such lowly tricks!]</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A certain high-end villa in Imperial.</p><br/><p>When Han Zixuan saw those comments online questioning the matter, hostility and ridicule filled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s already gone to this extent, yet they\u2019re still trying to justify it!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Zheng Anru said delightedly, \u201cThis time, they\u2019re toast! Ning Xi definitely doesn\u2019t know that we have even more shocking revelations with us! Zixuan, let\u2019s post the things right now! When the evidence is posted, we\u2019ll see what else they have to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan grinned as she happily painted her nails and said unhurriedly, \u201cWhat are you rushing for? Let them jump around for a little while more. The more they\u2019re defending Ning Xi now, the more disappointed they\u2019ll be when they find out the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, their luck was just amazing. Not only did they get such a huge handle on Ning Xi from Ning Xueluo, they had even caught a video that would consign Ning Xi to eternal damnation.</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru immediately nodded excitedly. \u201cRight! When that happens, all of the fans will turn ugly! When I think about the way she\u2019ll be berated by her own fans, it feels so good, it\u2019s almost orgasmic!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>That night, the two parties\u2019 fight reached a climax.</p><br/><p>The other parties\u2019 astroturfers were everywhere. Even though Ning Xi\u2019s fans were not as many as the astroturfers, but they had a strong fighting spirit. When it reached nightfall, they had even faintly suppressed quite a number of the opposition.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment when Han Zixuan posted another Weibo.</p><br/><p>[Initially, I really couldn\u2019t watch how a certain someone was behaving so shamelessly. I didn\u2019t want innocent people to be hurt, but I didn\u2019t think that it would raise so many malicious assumptions! Even a passerby wouldn\u2019t be able to stand a certain someone\u2019s disgusting manners. I\u2019ve just received an anonymous email about the truth. May everyone make their own judgement!]</p><br/><p>This Weibo was attached with a few more photos.</p><br/><p>The photo clearly showed the address as a certain luxurious hotel in Imperial. Not too far away, one could vaguely see YLD\u2019s logo. The banquet hall was filled with elegant clothes and gorgeous hair with wine goblets and gambling chips intertwined. It seemed to be YLD\u2019s fashion banquet.</p><br/><p>In the garden behind the banquet hall, on the swing sat a woman, and beside her was a man.</p><br/><p>Even though it was at night and the lights were dim, from this angle of the photo, one could clearly see the two people\u2019s faces.</p><br/><p>These two were, to everyone\u2019s bewilderment, the scandal\u2019s hero and heroine, Ning Xi and Su Yan!</p></div>\n</div>"}

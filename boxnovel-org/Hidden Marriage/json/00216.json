I\u2019m leaving so you can rest! I\u2019ll help you contact Ning Xuelo.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi left, Su Yan stared at the door, his face surprised and undecided.</p><br/><p>Who was that child in the end?</p><br/><p>And why did he think for a moment, that the child\u2019s facial features resembled Ning Xi\u2019s?</p><br/><p>He even recalled five years ago that dead baby, if the child did not die it would probably be\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Damn! In the end, he\u2019s just imagining things. It\u2019s crazy! The child died five years ago!</p><br/><p>The child is\u2026\u2026dead\u2026\u2026just has to be dead\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way he could have survived\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at Little Treasure who went in less than five seconds agao and has already brought Ning Xi out. Lu Jingli could not help but clap for him. Little treasure, good job!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took one look at Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s expression and immediately knew he was about to blame Little Treasure, so she hurried to defend him, \u201cDon\u2019t blame Little Treasure. He\u2019s a child and he doesn\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao, face helpless replied, \u201cYou spoil him too much.\u201d His tone tried to be reproachful, but there\u2019s no trace of anger.</p><br/><p>On the side, Jiang Muye watched how the atmosphere around Lu Ting Xiao changed, his expression becoming warm as soon as Ning Xi came out. He just stared shocked, his face an open book.</p><br/><p>Hypocritical! What is this hypocrisy!</p><br/><p>\u201cI let my Little Treasure become so sad. I\u2019ll definitely make it up to you!\u201d Ning Xi said, touching the little buns head, her eyes a little sad.</p><br/><p>This time, if she hurt Little Treasure, she wouldn\u2019t be able to make it up.</p><br/><p>After leaving the hospital, in the car Ning Xi coaxed the little bun for a while, and he soon fell asleep in her arms.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli who had been holding back for a long time finally couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Looking in the rearview mirror at Ning Xi one, he hastily asked, \u201cLittle XiXi, isn\u2019t this the brother Yan from your memories that you wanted to kill? In the end what kind of game are you playing? It can\u2019t be that you want to get back with that trash of a man, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the passenger seat, Jiang Muye heard him and snorted, \u201cGet together my ass! She\u2019s playing him like a fiddle. She\u2019s just setting a honey trap for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at him with an eyebrow raised, \u201cMuye, you\u2019ve actually grown up. You\u2019ve come to understand me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sitting next to Ning Xi, Ting Xiao has a slightly cold expression. Just now, he saw at a glance that Ning Xi\u2019s attitude towards Su Yan wasn\u2019t from the heart. What made him really angry is the honey trap\u2026\u2026that for men other than him she would\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, I have to give Ning Xuelo a call!\u201d Ning Xi, arms full of Little Treasure, carefully moved him a bit, and took out the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold him.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao said, taking Little Treasure into his arms.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi dialed the number, and the phone was immediately picked up with Ning Xuelo\u2019s sharp voice, \u201cNing Xi? What did you call me for? To brag? Slut! You\u2019ve ruined me, I bet your proud and happy right? Let me tell you, it\u2019s too early to be proud! Do you think brother Yan and my father and mother will believe you your lies? You really think we\u2019re country bumpkins\u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo continued to curse, only giving Ning Xi a faint opening, \u201cMiss Ning \u2026 \u2026 let me remind you once, the phone is on speaker mode and Su Yan is next to me~\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

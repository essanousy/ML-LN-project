Unlike the heavy formal court clothing from yesterday, the costume for today was much lighter, so she could finally breathe.</p><br/><p>After entering her dressing room, Ning Xi stared blankly for a moment. She hadn\u2019t expected to see Jia Qinging.</p><br/><p>She thought Jia Qingqing wouldn\u2019t be coming.</p><br/><p>Since Jia Qingqing had not made the cut for the second female lead, the director had invited her to act the third female lead, Consort Xian.</p><br/><p>The third female lead was also a disaster for the country, but had lesser screen time compared to Ning Xi. Furthermore, she was tortured quite badly by Ning Xi in the movie.</p><br/><p>Although the manager had accepted the invite on Jia Qingqing\u2019s behalf, she was still extremely unhappy. She hadn\u2019t even appeared at the opening ceremony, and had spread out news that she was going to quit the role.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi guessed that she had most likely heard of the rumours that the project had gotten a huge sum of investment, and had come obediently today.</p><br/><p>It was a billion dollar production after all.</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing was getting her makeup done. Upon spotting Ning Xi behind her through the mirror, she immediately scowled, completely not hiding her loathing towards Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Like Ning Xueluo, she had a rich father to support her, so she had always acted arrogantly on set. It gave her a bad reputation, but thanks to the netizens in her camp, all the rumours had been twisted to paint her as someone who was straightforward and genuine. They even made up the title of \u2018Entertainment Circle\u2019s #1 Beauty\u2019 for her.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Jia Qingqing hated Ning Xi to the bone, not just for stealing her role but also her title.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, isn\u2019t this the number one beauty in the entertainment circle? With so many sponsors supporting you, why are you coming to squeeze with us little artistes in this dressing room?\u201d Jia Qingqing said mockingly with a malicious expression.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stayed calm and found a chair to sit on without a care. She started reading the script, completely unaffected.</p><br/><p>She had a little quirk. Once she reached the set, she would concentrate fully on work and wouldn\u2019t let anyone affect her mental state.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, what\u2019s the meaning of this? Are you ignoring me?\u201d Jia Qingqing slammed the comb in her hands down.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued reading her script, and it seemed like she hadn\u2019t even heard her.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the makeup artist at the side could no longer keep watching. She coughed lightly and said, \u201cNing Xi\u2019s wearing earphones, so I\u2019m guessing she can\u2019t hear you!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only then that Jia Qingqing saw the two little white earbuds in Ning Xi\u2019s ears. She suddenly felt like she had punched cotton.</p><br/><p>This bitch, who knew if she had really heard, or if she had been acting!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had done it on purpose, of course.</p><br/><p>When she had first spotted Jia Qingqing, she had immediately put on her earphones and pretended not to hear.</p><br/><p>Because in this kind of situation, if there were any conflicts, it would only be detrimental to her no matter who was in the wrong. She had to avoid trouble where she could!</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Jia, I\u2019m done with the makeup, could you see if you\u2019re satisfied with it?\u201d The makeup artist spoke in a careful tone, clearly knowing that she was serving a difficult master.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with this! Do it again!\u201d Jia Qingqing didn\u2019t even look at the makeup before saying so.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask which parts you\u2019re dissatisfied with?\u201d The makeup artist asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything!\u201d</p><br/><p>The makeup artist\u2019s expression was frozen stiff, but she could only obediently redo her makeup.</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing was raging inside after seeing Ning Xi completely ignoring her, so she kept taking it out on the makeup artist.</p><br/><p>The makeup artist didn\u2019t dare to show any sort of negative expressions to Jia Qingqing, so she could only stare resentfully at Ning Xi in the corner.</p><br/><p>She knew that Jia Qingqing was trying to make things difficult for Ning Xi, and she had only been dragged into it.</p><br/><p>Only the male and female leads had their own personal dressing rooms. Everyone else shared a dressing room, so as long as Jia Qingqing wasn\u2019t done, Ning Xi could only sit there and wait.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was only when Jia Qingqing\u2019s manager had come in to rush her that Jia Qingqing left reluctantly. She didn\u2019t forget to glare fiercely at Ning Xi even on her way out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He didn\u2019t need anyone to carry him!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression darkened, \u201cUnfortunately, my trust in you is at its lowest since the incident from last time. I\u2019m unable to believe that you\u2019ll be able to take care of yourself. If you get lost again, even I won\u2019t be able to bear the consequences. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure bowed his head with a lonely expression.</p><br/><p>Realising that he had spoken too seriously, Lu Tingxiao rubbed his son\u2019s little head, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLao Zhang, bring the car to the underground garage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the excited gazes of the crowd gathered at the hotel entrance, the car door slowly opened and a man stepped out.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a grey western suit, his body was long and lean and he had a powerful aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2014 It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s Lu Tingxiao!! I was wondering which god of wealth had come. I didn\u2019t think it would be the God of Wealth! I totally predicted it, other than the God of Wealth, who else could afford to drive such an expensive car!? The Su family obviously can\u2019t even compare to Master Lu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens, hold me for a bit, I\u2019m going to faint\u2026 I\u2019ve only seen him on a magazine once, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d meet the real person here! I really want to go ask him for his signature and have him sign it on my panties!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose handsome and famous actors can only kneel before our Master Lu! If Master Lu enters the entertainment circle, how would they continue surviving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still dreaming! We\u2019ve already used up a lifetime of luck to see him this close in person! You still want him to enter the entertainment circle for your viewing pleasure everyday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The people at the door continued gossiping fervently long after the man in question had entered the hotel.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Boss Lu is usually swarmed by a retinue wherever he appears. Why is he coming to a hotel alone so late at night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows, anyway he can\u2019t possibly coming here for a woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame that an outstanding man like that doesn\u2019t get close to women! Why do you think Lu Tingxiao won\u2019t get close to women?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe probably likes men!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just nonsense! If he likes men, then where did his son come from? I feel that Master Lu must be the kind that\u2019s deeply in love. His feelings for the child\u2019s mother are so deep that he\u2019s been keeping her secret for so many years!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao found that the cast and crew had all left when he got upstairs. The group of people at the hotel\u2019s entrance were most likely the last batch. However, only Ning Xi was missing.</p><br/><p>He tried calling Ning Xi\u2019s phone as he walked down the corridors searching for her.</p><br/><p>No one picked up.</p><br/><p>As he was passing by the restrooms, Lu Tingxiao suddenly paused his steps. He could hear a phone ringing.</p><br/><p>After standing still and listening for a while, he realised it was coming from the female restroom.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao ended the call, and the sound stopped.</p><br/><p>After heaving a sigh of relief at finally finding the person he was looking for, Lu Tingxiao furrowed his brows.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t enter the female restroom to find her.</p><br/><p>Since she had not reacted at all to the loud ringing of her phone, she must be quite drunk.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao tried calling for her, but as expected, there was no reply.</p><br/><p>He stood in front of the sink between the male and female restrooms, and raised his long fingers to pinch at the center of his brows. The expression on his face was as if he were making a decision on a 10 billion yuan business deal.</p><br/><p>TL Note: 10 billion yuan = ~USD1.4 billion c:</p><br/>\n</div>"}

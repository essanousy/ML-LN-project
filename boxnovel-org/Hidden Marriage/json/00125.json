It\u2019ll take a longer period of time to finish filming the whole movie as well. I can negotiate with the director to have your scenes all pushed to the end, and we\u2019ll take responsibility for any possible losses within this period of time. I\u2019m sure Guo Qisheng will agree to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye scratched his head in frustration, \u201cIt looks like that\u2019s all we can do. Damn it, why does it seem like everything\u2019s going wrong lately? That collaboration with HN should have been finalised, so nothing could possibly have gone wrong with it. It even hailed while filming a kissing scene in the middle of summer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The more he spoke, the more he started to feel that something wasn\u2019t right. Finally, Jiang Muye punched his mattress, \u201cShit! Lu Tingxiao! Aren\u2019t you too shameless\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the Lu residence.</p><br/><p>Seeing daddy bringing a drunk Auntie Xiao Xi home, Little Treasure\u2019s expression was full of reproach and accusation.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao placed Ning Xi on the bed before he met his son\u2019s gaze and raised an eyebrow as he explained: \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who made her drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure\u2019s face still held reproach and accusation.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was helpless, \u201cFine, it was still my fault that I didn\u2019t take proper care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing daddy\u2019s sincere attitude, Little Treasure finally rescinded his unhappy gaze. He trotted over to the bathroom, and within moments, he came out with a warm towel. He removed his shoes, climbed onto the bed in one movement, then carefully kneeled by Ning Xi\u2019s side and wiped her face for her. When he was done with her face, he moved on to wipe her hands. Little Treasure looked extremely attentive and earnest.</p><br/><p>Seeing his son acting like a filial child, while Lu Tingxiao was gratified, he also felt like sighing at the same time.</p><br/><p>He had never been able to receive such treatment even as Little Treasure\u2019s very own dad.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh\u2026 my head hurts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun\u2019s heart ached when he heard Ning Xi\u2019s groans of pain. He hurriedly leaned over and tried to blow away the pain from Ning Xi\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>A glint flashed through Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes. He looked at his son and said, \u201cThis is part of your Auntie Xiao Xi\u2019s work, I can\u2019t interfere with it. However, if it\u2019s you, you could try to persuade her to try her best to drink less from now on. She listens to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun felt rather pleased hearing that. With a serious expression on his face, he nodded, indicating that he was accepting this very important mission.</p><br/><p>The next morning.</p><br/><p>Upon waking up, Ning Xi saw the little bun leaning by her bedside, with a severe expression on his little face. He looked extremely unhappy.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hurriedly sat up, \u201cUh, darling, what happened? Did something bad happen? Look at your expression! You look just like your dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying so, she pinched his little face, finding it adorable.</p><br/><p>The little bun quickly took out a writing pad from behind him, then started to flip through the pages one by one.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi saw that the little bun had drawn a few educational comics. Using pictures and words, he had illustrated the harm that drinking alcohol did to the heart, blood, bones, stomach, pancreas and liver, etc. one by one\u2026</p><br/><p>After he had finished flipping through the pages, the little bun stared at her with a strict gaze, his meaning clear.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi coughed lightly, \u201cUh, that, darling\u2026 Actually, alcohol isn\u2019t as terrible as you might think. It can lower the levels of harmful cholesterol, raise your self-confidence, activate your brain\u2019s power, and even manage your weight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding up her fingers, Ning Xi started counting. Although she knew that the little bun was only concerned for her, she couldn\u2019t just promise the child something without being able to fulfill the promise. How could she avoid drinking in her industry?</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, the little bun\u2019s black eyes were filled with anger and disappointment. With a turn of his head, he ran out of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t go\u2026\u201d Ning Xi scratched her head awkwardly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Besides, he was still a young boy from university at that point in time...</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked. From what he said, he must have been referring to five years ago when she was in love with Su Yan.</p><br/><p>However, she really did not remember meeting Xi Shiqing, so she was a little curious about the circumstances had he seen her in to remember it for five whole years.</p><br/><p>\"Really? When was that?\" Ning Xi asked casually.</p><br/><p>\"Five years ago, at your 18th birthday party,\" Xi Shiqing answered.</p><br/><p>The cup in Ning Xi's hand wavered.</p><br/><p>After all, that was the worst day of her life.</p><br/><p>Xi Shiqing\u2019s eyes clouded over as he slowly said, \"You know that our grandfathers are really close, so for that birthday dinner, I went along as well. I remember, you were wearing a white dress at that time. When I saw you for the first time many years ago, I was drawn to you, you were like a...natural princess...\"</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi listened to Xi Shiqing's description, she really did not know what to say. \"Hah, princess...obviously, Mr. Xi, your memory is a little foggy. That dress was a fake and I was even exposed by the crowd...\"</p><br/><p>Xi Shiqing interrupted her, \"Real or fake, is that really important?

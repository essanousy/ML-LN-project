Could I trouble you to tell Little Treasure not to wait for me for dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a whoosh, Lu Tingxiao had already sent his reply, and it was also a voice message.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi tapped on the voice message, and Lu Tingxiao\u2019s cold yet caring voice sounded from the phone: \u201cOkay, have fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xiao Xi\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye called her name sinisterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not only blind, even your ears are going deaf! Don\u2019t you think the tone my uncle uses when talking to you is a little strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Muye, are you itching for a beating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye firmly decided not to say anything more. Hehe, Ning Xiao Xi, just you wait. By tonight, I\u2019m definitely going to find some conclusive evidence to make you believe it. You. Better. Believe. It!</p><br/><p>At the Grand Pearl Hotel.</p><br/><p>Almost all the crew had been gathered for this dinner. Even Ning Xueluo and the other actors who didn\u2019t have scenes to film today had rushed over.</p><br/><p>Everyone welcomed Jiang Muye enthusiastically, and the atmosphere in the private dining room was very warm.</p><br/><p>After three rounds of drinks, Amy suddenly picked up her wineglass and stood up, \u201cNing Xi, I misunderstood you last time. I\u2019m dedicating this toast to you, take it as my apology and my thanks to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmy-jie, you\u2019re being too courteous!\u201d Ning Xi returned the toast by downing the rest of the wine in her glass.</p><br/><p>Everyone cheered in agreement, and following that, quite a few of them also toasted Ning Xi. Ning Xi didn\u2019t refuse any toasts, and settled all the grudges by drinking.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ning Xi getting along so well with the crew, Ning Xueluo put on a gratified smile, \u201cI told you that my junior wasn\u2019t that kind of person!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the dinner was coming to a close, a slender figure knocked on the door and walked in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, Young Master Su!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Su is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan-gege, why are you here?\u201d Seeing the new arrival, Ning Xueluo immediately welcomed him with an expression of joyful surprise.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the corner, the drunk Jiang Muye immediately woke up. His gaze was like a torch as he stared at the man dressed in a white suit standing at the door and giving off a refined aura.</p><br/><p>Su Yan!</p><br/><p>That was Su Yan?</p><br/><p>The only man that Ning Xi was rumoured to have loved?</p><br/><p>As a perfect boyfriend, Su Yan would always appear at occasions where Ning Xueluo needed some support. At this moment, Ning Xueluo was clinging onto his arm as he greeted everyone with a warm expression, \u201cI was eating here with some friends and I heard from Xueluo that all of you were here too. Order whatever you\u2019d like to eat, this dinner will be my treat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone roared together:</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Young Master Su\u2019s too rich!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re always riding on Teacher Ning\u2019s coattails!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re not going to be courteous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, a cold snort came from the corner, \u201cThis is my welcome dinner, why are you the one treating me? I\u2019m paying for this dinner!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was most likely because he was meeting another of Ning Xi\u2019s exes, but once Su Yan had appeared, Jiang Muye showed undisguised hostility.</p><br/><p>Men were always sensitive to hostility from other men. Su Yan detected Jiang Muye\u2019s unfriendly attitude towards him from the start. However, his face held a warm smile as he spoke unhurriedly, \u201cSince it\u2019s Mr Jiang\u2019s welcome dinner, then by right, Mr Jiang shouldn\u2019t be the one to pay for it at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, let us treat this round! Think of it as our hospitality as your hosts.\u201d Ning Xueluo supported.</p><br/><p>What hospitality!? He was born and raised in the capital, alright? Who even needed them as hosts!</p><br/><p>Jing Muye was going to use his drunkenness as an excuse to throw a tantrum when Ning Xi pressed on his shoulder from behind and whispered in his ear, \u201cAre you braindead? There\u2019s a guy who has more money than common sense, why not use him? Let him pay!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jiang Muye heard that, his expression turned uglier, \u201cHmph, are you sure you\u2019re not speaking up for him? That\u2019s your ex-lover right there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised a brow, \u201cAren\u2019t you my ex-lover too?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As she was about to ask Lu Tingxiao if he was going to go back to his office, she felt a vibration coming from the jacket.</p><br/><p>\"Lu Tingxiao, your phone is ringing.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao took his phone out from the pocket of the jacket, frowning at what he saw.</p><br/><p>\"What happened? Who\u2019s calling?\" Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Who was it that could make Lu Tingxiao pull an \"I-can\u2019t-handle-this\" face? How rare\u2026</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s Little Treasure\u2019s teacher,\" Lu Tingxiao replied.</p><br/><p>\"Isn\u2019t it school hours? Why would the teacher call now?\" Ning Xi questioned.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao gave it some thought, then he handed his phone to Ning Xi. \"You should take it.\"</p><br/><p>Obviously, Lu Tingxiao had no idea how to deal with a foreign creature like his son\u2019s teacher,</p><br/><p>\"Me?\" Ning Xi scratched her head. \"Okay...I guess it\u2019s better that I pick it up anyway\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She could not imagine the conversation between Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure\u2019s teacher. The teacher might speak a lot and he might just reply with a grunt.</p><br/><p>It would be even more possible that the teacher got frightened by Lu Tingxiao\u2019s voice\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not decline and put the call on the speaker for Lu Tingxiao to listen.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, is this Lu Qingyu\u2019s father?\" a female teacher\u2019s voice said.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Teacher Wang, I\u2019m Lu Qingyu\u2019s mother.\" To make things easier, Ning Xi did not give it much thought and just said it as it was.</p><br/><p>She did not realize...how intensely Lu Tingxiao was feeling at that moment.</p><br/><p>\"Did something happen to my kid in school?\" Ning Xi asked nervously.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s not it, Madam Lu, I\u2019m just calling to confirm if you and Mr. Lu really do not have time this afternoon. It\u2019d be great even if just one of you can attend! It\u2019d be so pitiful if both of you can\u2019t come!\" The teacher sounded disapproving.</p><br/><p>For Little Treasure to experience school life like any normal children, no one in the school except the principal knew about Little Treasure\u2019s real identity. Even the teachers were not informed of who he was.</p><br/><p>The teachers only knew that this kid was from a well-off family and preferred to be quiet. His parents were busy and did not seem to have a good relationship because ever since the first day of school, they were not seen at school together again.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi asked in confusion, \"This afternoon? Is there something going on in school?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t you know about it?\" The teacher sounded surprised.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at Lu Tingxiao and he shook his head, signaling that he was unaware as well.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied, \"Both of us are unaware of this. Little Treasure never mentioned it to us.\"</p><br/><p>\"He didn\u2019t? How could this be? I even confirmed with him a few times\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The teacher started to explain, \"Here\u2019s the thing. There will be a parental activity today. We\u2019re organizing a masquerade party. I\u2019ve told the children a few days ago to inform their parents, and I even gave them a letter for their parents. A few reminders were given out too. From the name list yesterday, only Lu Qingyu\u2019s parents will be absent. All the other children have at least one parent attending.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

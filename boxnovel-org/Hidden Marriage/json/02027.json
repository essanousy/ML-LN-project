Ning Xueluo still had the precious baby of the Su family. The check-up had previously even revealed that it was a boy. If they pressured Ning Xueluo too much under such circumstances, her precious grandson might be gone.</p><br/><p>After all, Su Yan had to face the issue of the other child, Su Xun, so it would be more advantageous to him if he were to have a successor sooner.</p><br/><p>No matter what, Ning Xueluo had to give birth to that child first.</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun held her tongue and used a gentle tone. \u201cYou can\u2019t really blame Su Yan for this! You know how Su Yan is like. Their relationship has always been solid. He would never cheat on her! If Ning Xi had not seduced Su Yan, he would never have done so!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if she said those flowery words, they were all part of a trick. That girl leaked the video online all for her own benefits. How are our families supposed to conduct ourselves in public from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun was aggrieved when she thought about how Ning Xi rejected her son so coldly. Had it not been for the Zhuangs, Ning Xi would just be a mere actress.</p><br/><p>Zheng Mingjun blamed everything on Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu became even angrier when Ning Xi\u2019s name was mentioned. \u201cJust what did I do in my past life to give birth to someone like her? Why is she always onto Xueluo and never letting go of the Nings?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua was worried when he saw Zhuang Lingyu being really worked up. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, Lingyu. Be careful of your health!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at what that brat has done! How can I not be angry? She\u2019s taking revenge on us. She\u2019s never considered us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Zhuang Lingyu was weeping, Su Yan arrived.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s pregnancy had hit him hard. In addition to Ning Xi\u2019s rejection, he felt depressed and he had made an excuse to go overseas as an escape, but unexpectedly, such a huge fiasco had happened back in the country.</p><br/><p>When he found out Ning Xi was misunderstood and criticized by the public, he was worried and jumped on the first flight home.</p><br/><p>However, before he could do anything, he saw the live stream of the charity night the moment he touched down.</p><br/><p>His first reaction was to look for Ning Xi, yet he received a call from his family informing him that Xueluo was hospitalized because of abdominal pain and wanted him to go there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Xueluo?\u201d Su Yan asked while panting.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu looked sharply at Su Yan, clearly unhappy with him. \u201cDo you still think of Xueluo as your wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan clenched his fists and looked downwards ashamedly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun went up and gave Su Yan a nudge. \u201cIt\u2019s alright now. I know you were deceived by Ning Xi. Go take a look at Xueluo and talk to her. Don\u2019t let her misunderstand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I\u2026\u201d Su Yan frowned.</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun shot Su Yan a look to prevent him from keep talking, then she pushed him into the ward and continued talking to Zhuang Lingyu and Ning Yaohua.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal for married couples to have some arguments. If we get involved too much, things might get worse. They even have their own child now. How could they get a divorce? Even if Su Yan insists, there\u2019s still Hongguang and me! Don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t let Xueluo suffer!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

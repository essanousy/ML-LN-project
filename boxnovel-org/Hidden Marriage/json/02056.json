From registering the name to selecting a place, we hired a professional marketing director, and finally, we got our very first flagship store\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss told me that one day, she\u2019d help me clarify in front of the whole world. She also told me that any tricks are useless against true power. Until the day when Spirit is strong enough to speak for itself, people would believe me even if I have no proof! These words have been encouraging me all along\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Gong Shangze\u2019s face fell. \u201cEverything was going well until that incident happened to Boss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd then realized that Gong Shangze was talking about the incident whereby Ning Xi had gone into a vegetative state for a year.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss isn\u2019t only my supervisor. She\u2019s also my belief. It\u2019s because of her that I found confidence in design and inspiration again. I\u2019m back not because of just myself, but I also want to prove to her that she didn\u2019t choose the wrong person. I want to make her proud of me!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, during the year of Boss\u2019 disappearance, I lost my direction. I thought I was being abandoned again. All the insecurities and uneasiness came back to me, including the loss of my faith. I couldn\u2019t design anything at that point of time\u2026 until\u2026 she came back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, everyone understood what happened.</p><br/><p>No wonder\u2026</p><br/><p>No wonder Gong Shangze had no new work for almost a year. No wonder Spirit released several new series right after Ning Xi returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack To The Origins\u201d. That was exactly Ning Xi\u2019s circumstance!</p><br/><p>The inspiration behind the series had come from Ning Xi too!</p><br/><p>No wonder Ning Xi always looked so glittering when she wore Spirit\u2019s clothes. It felt like those clothes had been designed for Ning Xi exclusively!</p><br/><p>Of course! Ning Xi was his source of inspiration after all!</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze\u2019s words surprised everyone. At the same time, everyone\u2019s hatred towards David grew even more.</p><br/><p>The people who had almost been brainwashed by Ning Xueluo just now woke up too.</p><br/><p>This woman was allowing David to do whatever he wanted, yet she could still turn the truth around and shamelessly say that History was made for Gong Shangze.</p><br/><p>History was the one who had left him in despair, almost ruining such a talented designer!</p><br/><p>The audience back in China started spamming the chat rooms after hearing Gong Shangze\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of Bro Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnique taste, accurate sense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis story is really lovely. I almost cried when I listened to Gong Shangze! It\u2019s so touching!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t just boss and employee. They are the best partners!\u201d</p><br/><p>As people were admiring the Ning Xi-Gong Shangze combination, they were outraged at Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Ning Xueluo is really shameless! She even tried to take Gong Shangze for herself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only did Ning Xueluo take Ning Xi\u2019s parents and boyfriend, now her subordinate has stolen her design drafts too! Like owner, like dog!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

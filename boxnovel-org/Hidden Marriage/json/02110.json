However, she was pretty interested to see pictures of Lu Tingxiao when he was young; she wanted to see if he really looked like Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over at the big screen as Second Master had mentioned that there would be photos of little Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>A photo appeared and the setting seemed to be in a hospital. There was a signage saying \u201cDepartment of Gynecology\u201d and a pregnant girl sat on the long bench.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s expression changed the moment this photo appeared.</p><br/><p>Because the pregnant girl in the photo\u2026 was Ning Xi!</p><br/><p>While the girl\u2019s face looked much younger, it was obvious that was her.</p><br/><p>In just a moment, countless photos flashed through the screen, all of them showing Ning Xi pregnant, in the hospital, on the road, in the park\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? W-what\u2019s happening!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person in the photo is Ning Xi, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe looks young in there, but that sure is her! But why is Ning Xi sitting in front of the department of gynecology with a bulged tummy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Lu Jingli\u2019s expression darkened and he wanted to take out the disc, yet he was stopped by a large palm.</p><br/><p>If they stopped it right now, it would only attract more rumors and things would be really messy by then.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s face already went pale when she saw those pictures. She panicked.</p><br/><p>After Lu Tingxiao stopped Lu Jingli from taking out the disc, he put his arms over the girl\u2019s shaking shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxio focused intently on the photos, observing how Ning Xi was pregnant, walking alone, shopping alone, going to the hospital alone. His grip on the girl became tighter and tighter\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d Suddenly, there was the sharp laughter of a woman among the crowd.</p><br/><p>A woman in a waitress\u2019s outfit rushed below the big screen and then screamed, \u201cDaughter of a prestigious family, a proud lady! This woman got pregnant by a stranger when she was 18, yet she\u2019s still acting all pure in front of everyone! She\u2019s just trash! A shameless slut!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned to see Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 That woman, isn\u2019t that Ning Xueluo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s her! She\u2019s the foster daughter of the Ning family! The one who was chased out recently!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s matter was too high-profile to be ignored, so many people recognized her almost instantly.</p><br/><p>Everyone believed the pictures when they heard Ning Xueluo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>It was perfectly normal for Ning Xueluo to know Ning Xi\u2019s secrets, so she had come here for revenge!</p><br/><p>No one expected such a big scandal would be revealed at Lu Tingxiao\u2019s birthday banquet\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s wife, the head lady of the Lu family, had such a huge scandal.</p><br/><p>An out-of-wedlock pregnancy at 18?!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh god! No way! Is Ning Xueluo telling the truth? Ning Xi got pregnant with a stranger\u2019s child at 18?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the Lu family know about this? Does Lu Tingxiao know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! They wouldn\u2019t have gotten married if they knew! That\u2019s so scary! As expected, the private lives of women in the entertainment industry are incredibly messy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

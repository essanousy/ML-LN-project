We tried to stop her, but she seems very agitated. She said some odd stuff, then barged inside when weren\u2019t noticing!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a short silence over the phone, then Ning Xi\u2019s soothing voice came through. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The receptionist sounded a little hesitant. \u201cShe said that\u2026 matters between the both of you should be settled and questioned why you harmed your own mother\u2026 and how you even harmed an innocent child\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. She\u2019s pregnant, so we\u2019re worried something might happen and didn\u2019t force her out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Get everyone back to their positions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, CEO Ning.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a small hiccup, the company returned back to normal.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hung up the phone in her office.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo had come to look for her and kicked up such a big fuss?</p><br/><p>This was not like her at all\u2026</p><br/><p>Harmed Mother?</p><br/><p>An innocent child\u2026</p><br/><p>She heard the news about Zhuang Lingyu being pregnant, but Ning Xueluo\u2019s words seemed to indicate that the child was gone.</p><br/><p>There was some noise outside the door. Someone pushed through the door and entered.</p><br/><p>The few security guards looked troubled as they stood behind Ning Xueluo. \u201cBoss, she\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You guys can go back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d The guards were relieved and then left.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the large office room was only left with the two of them.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s hair looked messy and her makeup was smudged too. She looked miserable as a whole, and she seemed like she was about to break down anytime. She knelt on the floor before Ning Xi. \u201cSister, I beg you, no matter how much you hate me, just come at me. Don\u2019t hurt anyone else\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched. She felt that the Oscars owed her an award.</p><br/><p>The way she acted like she was in pain and blamed herself for her mother\u2019s loss of her child, no one would doubt her for not being a filial daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. There isn\u2019t anyone else in here. You don\u2019t have to show me how skilled you are at acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression changed suddenly and she became oddly calm out of a sudden.</p><br/><p>She stood up slowly and carefully tidied her messy hair as she smiled. \u201cCEO Ning, it\u2019s really tough to meet you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Miss Ning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her address of \u201cMiss Ning\u201d sounded extremely sarcastic and Ning Xueluo was taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m here to see how great you\u2019re doing!\u201d Ning Xueluo\u2019s face darkened like an endless abyss. \u201cNing Xi, you must be very happy now, aren\u2019t you? You forced me out of the entertainment industry and let everyone know that I\u2019m just a daughter from a rural area, and you even told the whole world about Su Yan\u2019s intention to divorce me! And now, you\u2019ve even destroyed History. My reputation is all gone. I have nothing left. Aren\u2019t you happy now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The only thing she had left was her identity as Mrs. Su. If it were not for the child in her womb, the Su family would have abandoned her a long time ago.</p><br/><p>This witch\u2026</p><br/><p>She had actually pushed her to such lengths!</p></div>\n</div>"}

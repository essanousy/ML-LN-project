Han Momo panicked. \"What to do now, Sis Xi?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi touched Gong Shangze\u2019s burning forehead and helped him to lean on her shoulder. \"I\u2019ll bring him to the hospital. You take the prize for him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Me?\" Han Momo was shocked, her jaw left hanging.</p><br/><p>In the end, Han Momo hopped up the stage like a bunny, almost tripping from her nervousness and outdoing everyone's expectations.</p><br/><p>And her outfit today\u2026</p><br/><p>She wore a lolita-style dress and looked like a cute Japanese doll.</p><br/><p>\"What the heck? Nirvana Reincarnated's designer is a little girl? This doesn\u2019t make sense!\"</p><br/><p>\"Such a grand style. Even if it\u2019s not a man, might as well be a grown woman! Is she even legal yet?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Uh, you\u2019re...Nirvana Reincarnated's designer, X?\" the host asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>Qu Guanyang raised his eyebrows and touched his chin to ask, \"Are you here in someone else\u2019s stead?\"</p><br/><p>His instinct from his experience in the industry told him that she was not the designer for Nirvana Reincarnated.</p><br/><p>Han Momo nodded and bowed to the audience politely. \"Everyone, I\u2019m sorry, X isn\u2019t able to come today because he is not feeling well. I\u2019m his assistant and I\u2019m here to receive the prize in his stead!\"</p><br/><p>Now that made sense\u2026</p><br/><p>As everyone let out a sigh of relief, the mystery shrouding X intensified!</p><br/><p>The competition evening finally came to an end. Han Momo carefully held the trophy and sneaked out even before the journalists could come to her.</p><br/><p>All the attention was shifted to David and Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>\"Ms. Ning, History lost this time. Do you have anything to say?\"</p><br/><p>\"Was Qu Guanyang implying that you\u2019re trying to manipulate the competition\u2019s result?\"</p><br/><p>\"Director David, you\u2019ve lost to someone even with your best design. How do you feel?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>David looked really unwell and he did not know what to answer.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s phone had been ringing non-stop after the competition results were out. They had lost a few million dollars in just a few minutes after some big customers canceled their reservations. The worst thing was that the unknown Spirit Studio could end up as their biggest competitor.</p><br/><p>David knew that things were bad just by looking at Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression. \"Miss, it\u2019s just a local award. It\u2019s nothing!\"</p><br/><p>\"Nothing?! In just a few minutes, we\u2019ve lost five million dollars!\"</p><br/><p>Most importantly, how could she face everyone? People said she had good taste and had a treasure in her hands. Now, she did not win the prize and was even accused of controlling the competition results!</p><br/><p>David cursed internally. Five million dollars, so what? Remember how much we earned before!</p><br/><p>But he still spoke carefully, \"Ms. Ning, please believe me. The effect is just temporary, that designer has a similar style to mine, but we\u2019ve already dominated the market. He can never take away our customers!\"</p><br/><p>\"He'd better not!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Are you crazy! Have you gotten addicted to acting out unnecessary drama?</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for more urgent matters, Ning Xi would have scolded him with her hands on her hips.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened!\u201d Guo Qisheng hurried over with rage written on his face.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pinched the bridge of her nose, \u201cI realised that it didn\u2019t feel right after I pierced her. The blade didn\u2019t retract!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was supposed to be a retractable sword. Once it met force, it should have retracted. She had not expected that an accident like this would happen.</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng flew into a rage, \u201cWhere\u2019s the prop director! Come out now! I told you a million times to check everything properly! We can\u2019t afford any accidents happening! How did you do your work!\u201d</p><br/><p>The prop director stumbled and ran over, sweating hard, \u201cDirector Guo, everything was fine when I checked it, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems!\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng slapped him with the script in his hands and roared: \u201cThen tell me what happened just now!\u201d Problems had been occurring on set since the start, his patience was close to its limit.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wang Taihe suddenly asked, \u201cWho was the last one to touch this sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026 It should be Ning Xi. I handed the sword over to her right after I finished inspecting it. She\u2019s been holding it all the time to practise. It\u2019s my fault, I should have checked it again before filming started!\u201d The prop director apologised continuously.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ning Xi\u2019s pupils contracted. She would have to be an idiot if she didn\u2019t realise what was happening by now.</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone present had mixed expressions.</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng glared at the prop director before he looked at Ning Xi with a complicated gaze. Finally, while holding back his anger, \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this later. We have to send her to the hospital first! Lock down the whole set, don\u2019t let the news get out!\u201d</p><br/><p>In Beijing\u2019s First People\u2019s Hospital.</p><br/><p>While Ning Xueluo\u2019s wound was being treated, Su Yan was accompanying her inside. Ning Xi stood in the corridor outside the ward, her back against the cold hospital wall as the cogs turned in her brain.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo deserved to be called the ancestor of all innocent flowers. Even her pity ploys were at the next level. Wasn\u2019t Ning Xueluo afraid that she wouldn\u2019t stop in time and just stab her to death?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, she had immediately stopped the moment she found that something was wrong with the sword, so the wound wasn\u2019t too deep. Ning Xueluo suffered a superficial wound at most. However, it was the consequences of this incident that were going to be troublesome.</p><br/><p>The most pressing matter was to find a way to prove her innocence\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was still deep in thought when she heard a burst of hurried footsteps.</p><br/><p>She had just raised her head when a slap landed smack on her face. Following that, a burning ache came from her cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard! How could you do such a thing to Xueluo! If you have any complaints, then come at me! I was the one who kept her in the Ning family, I was the one who was willing to pamper her and love her! What has Xueluo done wrong?\u201d The newcomer shouted at her in hysteria, the look in her eyes was as if she were looking at her sworn enemy.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wiped away the blood at the corner of her mouth before slowly raising her head. She watched the wealthy lady before her motionlessly. Dressed in a luxurious, noble and refined manner, this was her mother.</p><br/><p>Behind Zhuang Lingyu was her father, Ning Yaohua. The same disgust shone in his eyes, \u201cIf anything happens to Xueluo, I won\u2019t forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of the two people before her, one was her biological mother and the other was her biological father. From start to end, they never asked for the whole story. Instead, the moment they had come, they only had beatings and threats for her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had millions of lines she could say to make them froth at the mouth in anger. However, right now, it was as if she had been wrung dry of all her energy. She didn\u2019t feel like speaking. She only gazed at them with a sinister look in her eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

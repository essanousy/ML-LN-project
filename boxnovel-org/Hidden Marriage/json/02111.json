He just looked calmly at Ning Xueluo who was in maniac mode. \u201cThank you, Ms. Ning, for bringing these precious memories up for Xiao Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p><em>Precious memories?</em></p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was dumbfounded. Lu Tingxiao continued, \u201cThe stranger you mentioned was none other than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes popped out after a short moment of silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? W-what!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does Lu Tingxiao mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe stranger is him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s mind was thrown into chaos as fear filled her eyes. \u201cWhat are you saying? CEO Lu, the child inside this woman\u2019s womb was an illegitimate child! How\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli rolled his eyes and laughed coldly. \u201cMiss, first, you said my brother is a stranger. Then, you accuse my nephew of being an illegitimate child. Wow, I\u2019m impressed by your courage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s words caused another big wave of shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure? Does Lu Jingli mean that the child Ning Xi had was Little Treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Little Treasure\u2019s biological mother is Ning Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xueluo said Ning Xi was pregnant at 18. If I calculate following the time, it\u2019s correct!\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the noisy gossip, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s icy cold gaze scanned everyone.</p><br/><p>That immense aura of his hushed everyone. No one said a word.</p><br/><p>After a while, Lu Tingxiao said, \u201cI apologize for causing some unnecessary misunderstanding. Ning Xi and I knew each other since a long time ago, but we separated for several years because of some misunderstanding. We\u2019ve gotten back together again ever since Xiao Xi came back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao took a pause, then continued, \u201cLittle Treasure is the child of Ning Xi and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was stunned at first, then she could not stop giggling. \u201cHahaha\u2026 CEO Lu, I didn\u2019t expect for you to lie and say that illegitimate child is yours! How impressive!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli could not believe how stupid she could be. \u201cMiss, your stupidity is what impresses me the most. How could my brother not know what he did? Due to some procedural necessity before, my sister-in-law and Little Treasure did a DNA test. Do you think everyone is as stupid as you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-this is impossible! Definitely impossible!\u201d Ning Xueluo straightened her back and her tone sounded determined.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli raised his eyebrows. \u201cOh? Impossible, how are you so determined that it\u2019s impossible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo could not say anything. Of course, she could not.</p><br/><p>She was the one who had drugged Ning Xi and arranged the two male gigolos!</p><br/><p>How was that possible?</p><br/><p>W-wait\u2026</p><br/><p>The gigolos mentioned that Ning Xi had gone into the wrong room\u2026</p><br/><p>She had done it with a stranger\u2026</p><br/><p>Could it be!?</p><br/><p>Could that man be Lu Tingxiao!?</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s face went pale. Her body was trembling as if she had just found out something oddly terrifying.</p><br/><p>This possibility was utterly shocking to her!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an old man stepped out from the crowd.</p></div>\n</div>"}

They quickly rushed out of their bedrooms and went to the living room.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Zhan was thrown out, he did not give up, he kicked the wall with his feet and then aimed the dagger at Han Xiao\u2019s heart again.</p><br/><p>In that brief moment of time, Han Xiao flicked his finger and hit Xiao Zhan\u2019s right hand.</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan screamed in agony as the dagger flew somewhere far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Zhan, you were naughty the last time. See if I\u2019ll still let you live today!\u201d Han Xiao grinned. It was an evil grin.</p><br/><p>He then grabbed Xiao Zhan\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>At this urgent second, Han Xiao turned over to peer at the three people on the stairs. \u201cHow should I deal with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, beat him to death!\u201d Tang Lang yelled.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked. \u201cMmm, I don\u2019t see an issue with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao went along. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was taken aback and stared at them in shock. \u201cYou guys\u2026 How\u2019re you guys so cruel?

Updated b.y . com</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at Han Xiao. She had seen a lot of shameless people, but not one of them were as shameless as Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that he wanted to take revenge for what had happened the last time, so he crushed that skinny man on purpose and acted innocent.</p><br/><p>Not only that, Han Xiao wanted to blame them even though he killed the person.</p><br/><p>They were all on the stairs, how could they kill, with psychic powers?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Master Han Xiao is really shameless. What do you guys think?\u201d Ning Xi smiled and looked at Tang Lang and Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be rude, Third Junior Sister. Don\u2019t talk about my grandfather like that or I\u2019ll get angry! While he\u2019s a little shameless, shameless people are invincible\u2026 My grandfather is the best. What he\u2019s saying makes sense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Lu Tingxiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to eat watermelon!\u201d Han Xiao ignored them and plopped down onto the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it, Grandfather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang went into the living room swiftly and took out the ice cold watermelon for Han Xiao. He then dragged Xiao Zhan\u2019s body outside.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went downstairs and sliced up the watermelon, then she handed it to Han Xiao with glittering eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you let Yorick and the doctor leave on purpose, didn\u2019t you? You did so to lure this man out!\u201d Ning Xi exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYorick\u2026\u201d Han Xiao stared at Ning Xi. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

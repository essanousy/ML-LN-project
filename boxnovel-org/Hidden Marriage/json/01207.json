Bro Xi, I'll return this for you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Thanks.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Inside a creepy villa in the outskirts, as promised, Annie went back and quietly opened a door to a certain room.</p><br/><p>The Boss should still be out now\u2026</p><br/><p>The house was quiet and there was no light. She carefully walked towards the cupboard and wanted to put the item inside\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment she opened the cupboard, the candle on the wall lit up, and there was a voice beside her ear, \"My little bait, what are you looking for?\"</p><br/><p>\"Argh!\" Annie looked back in shock and saw the man lying on the bed, her face turning pale right away. \"Nope, nothing! I'm not looking for anything! I-I just\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Your hand.\" The man used an extremely cold voice.</p><br/><p>Annie could not do anything else, so to prove her innocence, she took out the diamond and the crown from the bag.</p><br/><p>The man understood instantly the moment he saw those items, and the atmosphere turned chilly all of a sudden. \"The other one.\"</p><br/><p>Annie then put the things in her right hand onto the bed as well, the cute cookies clearly seen through the transparent plastic bag.</p><br/><p>\"Leave what's in your right hand, throw what's in your left.\"</p><br/><p>He meant for her to leave the biscuits there, and throw the others away?</p><br/><p>\"B-but...the biscuits are for me\u2026\" Annie looked reluctantly at her boss.</p><br/><p>The man glared at her coldly, then Annie quickly left her biscuits and ran away.</p><br/><p>How could he do this? Bro Xi made those cookies for me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Peachwood, after Ning Xi asked Annie to return the items, she felt relieved. It had been a long day and she was hammered. She changed into her slippers after she entered the house, leaving her bag aside. She started undressing as she walked into her room\u2026</p><br/><p>She took off her coat, then her stockings. She proceeded to take off her bra and jump onto her soft bed\u2026</p><br/><p>But when she jumped on it, she was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>It did not feel quite right!</p><br/><p>It was hard...and warm... What was this? It feels like muscles, full of power\u2026 Did the blanket just gain some kind of human characteristic?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly rolled off the bed and clumsily turned on the light.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the room was bright as day.</p><br/><p>She then saw\u2026the devil lying on the bed, wearing a pair of silver-framed glasses. He was reading a book with his pajamas on and his hair was still a little wet. He had probably just come out of the shower. However, his pajamas were all messy now because of her, his chest bare\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the direct opposite of his usual cold look... How seductive\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put her hand on her chest and tried to calm her thumping heart down. \"Lu...Lu Tingxiao, why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>He made space for her and patted the bed. \"Come over.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gulped as she quickly went over and looked at her man. \"Baby, what's happening? Why are you suddenly here?\"</p><br/><p>Warming the bed and sleeping with her?</p><br/><p>He raised his eyebrows. \"You don't like it?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

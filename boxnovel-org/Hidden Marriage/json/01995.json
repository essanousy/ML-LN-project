He took a deep breath to calm himself down, then he said, \u201cXiao Xi, come over to Starlight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her eyebrows when she heard Su Yan. She did not expect him to be there to recruit her.</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s gaze was gentle. \u201cXiao Xi, you\u2019ve been struggling on your own for so many years. Even though you\u2019re doing well now, no matter how much Glory World prioritizes you, it\u2019s still a monetary relationship between you and them. If you\u2019re in Starlight, at least, I can take care of you.</p><br/><p>\u201cOr if you\u2019re tired, you can always take a break and you won\u2019t need to push yourself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Ning XI laughed. \u201cCEO Su, do you mean that you want me to be your mistress?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s expression changed and he quickly replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that, Xiao Xi! I just want to take care of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO Su, please take care of your wife and son. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s face turned pale when he heard Ning Xi. \u201cYou know about it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan looked at the girl in front of him and tried to explain. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you, Xiao Xi. I went back and already had the lawyers draft the divorce papers. I asked Xueluo out to talk to her, but that night, Xueluo suddenly fainted and was admitted into the hospital. Then, the results came out. She\u2019s pregnant\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI really couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell her under those circumstances. I know I let you down again, Xiao Xi. Wait for me. Give me more time, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan then gazed at the girl nervously, but she closed her eyes as she rested her head on the rope of the swing. She seemed to be asleep.</p><br/><p>This scene\u2026</p><br/><p>As if Su Yan was under a spell, he walked over to the girl uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Just moments before his hand touched the girl, someone suddenly dashed out and blocked Su Yan\u2019s hand as he stood in front of Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s eyes were icy cold. \u201cCEO Su, as someone else\u2019s husband, I\u2019m afraid this isn\u2019t appropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The word \u201chusband\u201d made Su Yan seem unwell. \u201cXiao Xi is drunk. Please ask her assistant to come over to take care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye scoffed, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your damned business!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then stared at Ning Xi who was sleeping peacefully at the moment, then he helped her get up.</p><br/><p><em>Stupid girl! Please be more aware of your surroundings!</em></p><br/><p>Ning Xi opened her eyes. \u201cBlondie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I ask you to control your drinking?! Why did you drink so much?!\u201d Jiang Muye roared at her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pinched the space between her eyes. \u201cI only drank a glass\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After waking up from her coma, her body had mostly recovered, but of course, there were some residual effects. She found out that her tolerance to liquor had become much lower.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye quickly left the little garden with her angrily. \u201cThat Su bastard almost had you just now, do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you should thank me! You must have done something really good in your past life to have me as your ex-boyfriend! I\u2019m going to be so pissed off with you if you compare me to that trash again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! You\u2019re my nephew!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it again, who am I? Do you think I won\u2019t just leave you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro! Bro\u2026 About what happened today, please don\u2019t tell my darling\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only care about your darling!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

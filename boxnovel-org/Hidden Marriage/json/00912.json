Starting the massacre mode meant that even if the opponent did not want to fight you, you could still immediately go for the kill.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were punishments for forcefully killing someone. After the player started the massacre mode, they would become red-listed themselves and become a monster, then anyone could kill them from then on.</p><br/><p>The players were initially all flooding the forums, shocked that Piercing Wind would join Glory of Light's wedding. Someone had even speculated that Piercing Wind was prepared to join the faction but in the next second, everyone witnessed him get off his saddle and catch everyone off guard by going into massacre mode.</p><br/><p>The man in the battle god armor was bloodied red as the huge scythe in his hand cut through the sky. The red crescent-shaped light fell on Glory of Light's body and instantly, he lost half his blood.</p><br/><p>Before everyone could react, Piercing Wind had made a few more moves and slashed mercilessly, causing Glory of Light to fall on the floor, thoroughly dead.</p><br/><p>The entire world's channels had been flooded with comments and speculations earlier, but at that moment, it fell silent.</p><br/><p>In the Internet caf\u00e8, Zhuang Rongguang slammed his fist onto the table in fury. \"Hey! That bastard actually dared to kill me!\"</p><br/><p>His friends around him were dumbstruck. \"What just...happened?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are you stunned? Quickly revive me!\" Zhuang Rongguang demanded unhappily.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, oh!\"</p><br/><p>In the game, a medical player had injected him with \"life\" and Zhuang Rongguang was immediately resurrected.</p><br/><p>However, in the next second, another red glow flashed across the screen and Zhuang Rongguang's character fell to the ground again...</p><br/><p>Because he was not yet restored to full blood condition when he was revived, this time only a single move was needed to strike him down.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang, his friends, everyone in the gaming world, and the guests attending the wedding were stupefied once again.</p><br/><p>If the first time was a misunderstanding, the second time was definitely intentional. Piercing Wind was clearly here to kill Glory of Light!</p><br/><p>On another computer, Jiang Muye sent a voice note as he was getting a headache. \"Damn it, what the heck are you trying to do? How did this guy offend you?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied, \"He bullied my person!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye had nothing to say.</p><br/><p>Logically, Ning Xi did not have any other good friends in the game, so who had Glory of Light bullied?</p><br/><p>Just as she said that, Ning Xi had already killed the resurrected Glory of Light for the third time.</p><br/><p>At that moment, someone finally spoke in the forum.</p><br/><p>Glory of Light: [Piercing Wind! What is the meaning of this!!!???]</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's reply was a stab to him before immediately sitting down cross-legged, blocking the path of the bridal troop.</p><br/><p>Nothing was said but the intention was already quite obvious. He was here to cause trouble!</p><br/><p>The world: [Jesus! Can someone tell me what the situation is?]</p><br/><p>The world: [It's already so obvious, do you still need to ask? Piercing Wind is obviously here to steal his wife!]</p><br/><p>The world: [Hey, hey, hey! I've really lived long enough! Who knew that watching a wedding would lead to such a huge scandal?!]</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Glory of Light: [Piercing Wind, I don't have any grudges with you. You've come here yourself to cause trouble, don't blame me for being merciless!]</p><br/><p>Now that Piercing Wind had started massacre mode, everyone could go up to kill him. Even if he was great at battling, it could not compare to the force of Glory of Light's entire number one faction.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone's screen suddenly turned into a sea of gold and the sound of birds crying was heard from their speakers. A huge shadow covered the sky, then a golden phoenix landed and from the phoenix, a magical fluttery woman floated down.</p><br/><p>To everyone's shock, the ID above the woman's head was Fallen Bloom.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He wore casual home clothes as his forehead tilted forward while he sat on the rattan chair under a rack of flowers in the manner of an immortal without a trace of mundanity.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi ran over and then glared at him angrily.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao instantly gulped at the way his wife\u2019s beautiful eyes were spurting fires of rage. He put the newspaper in his hands down and hurled out a hand to pull her to his knees. His wide palm started to massage her aching lower back with the right amount of strength. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMassage a little higher!\u201d Ning Xi asked with a darkened expression, \u201cHow dare you ask? I already told you I had something to do today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only did it once.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she saw his innocent expression, Ning Xi exploded. \u201cThen, did I feed it to the dogs the few times after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s lips curled. \u201cThe few times after that, you asked for it, my wife. Did you forget?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shoot! It really was her who had asked for it\u2026</p><br/><p>Bloody hell, the problem was that he made the first move to seduce her, so how could she resist?</p><br/><p>Now, she finally knew why there were so many incapable rulers who were charmed by lust in history.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Whatever it was, when Ning Xi had rushed to look for Jiang Muye, it was already late at night.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi managed to console the little master with all of her might.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste time anymore. Quickly go change!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw Ning Xi\u2019s impatient manner, Jiang Muye was even angrier. This dude wanted to see him in a female outfit so much, yet she could still be late for an entire day and only woke after sleeping till the afternoon. He could already guess with the tip of his toes about what she had been doing last night.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi waited anxiously in the living room as Jiang Muye dillydallied for about half an hour before his bedroom door finally opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you changed?\u201d Ning Xi impatiently looked over.</p><br/><p>In the next second, Ning Xi covered her eyes and rolled in suffering on the sofa. \u201cCrap! My poor eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jiang Muye saw Ning Xi\u2019s reaction, he was so angry that he stomped over in his high heels aggressively. \u201cNing Xiao Xi, what do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye wore a red dress with a pair of 12-centimeter high heels. His hair was tousled in golden waves and he had smoky-eye makeup and flaming red lips.</p><br/><p>This scene\u2026 was just\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was dying as she held her chest in fits of laughter. \u201cEven if I was late, you can\u2019t take revenge on me like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye frowned. \u201cDo I look that terrible? But I was just following Carl\u2019s image!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi opened her eyes with much difficulty and looked at Jiang Muye. \u201cThe person who played Carl in the original version was smaller than you. His features weren\u2019t as sharp as yours too. Of course, this look is fine, but for you to completely imitate him is too shocking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what do you suggest I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, they would be going to Lorraine to shoot and his scene in the female disguise was coming up very soon. Even though he had already read the script through and through, the challenge for this character this time was huge and he was really not confident.</p><br/><p>When the time came, the filming crew would have professionals do his makeup. However, before that, he needed to have a foundation himself, which was why he had pulled Ning Xi over for advice. Initially, Lei Ming had said he would arrange a professional stylist for him, but he had firmly rejected the offer.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pinched the space between her brows. \u201cEnough, change out of all your clothes. I\u2019ll help you do your makeup again too! You really don\u2019t know how to use things sparingly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you can?\u201d Jiang Muye looked at her a little worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBelieve my judgment, alright? I\u2019m just worried that you\u2019ll fall in love with yourself later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was speechless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

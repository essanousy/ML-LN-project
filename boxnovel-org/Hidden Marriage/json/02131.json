Previously, in Deer Town, the Master had suffered severe injuries as a result of the ambush by the people the other side had sent.</p><br/><p>As for Han Xiao\u2019s past, forget about Tang Lang, even Ning Xi was not clear about it.</p><br/><p>The only thing they could be sure of was that Han Xiao and the Rothschild family had grudges between them.</p><br/><p>As for what grudges they were, the fact that the Rothschild family continuously sent assassins out to kill Han Xiao provided them some food for thought.</p><br/><p>However, according to Ning Xi and Tang Lang\u2019s thoughts, they both agreed that Han Xiao must have once offended the Rothschild clan.</p><br/><p>After all, when it came to people like Han Xiao, who liked to stir up trouble and find someone to compare fighting notes with when he was bored, yet actually did start to fight for real, offending the Rothschilds was not out of the ordinary for him.</p><br/><p>However, this was to them no doubt a good thing.</p><br/><p>After all, Ning Xi had already used her whistle to get Han Xiao to help defeat Annie and retrieve the antidote.</p><br/><p>As for the Rothschilds, Ning Xi already had no way of getting Han Xiao\u2019s help again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, with Grandfather around, so what if it\u2019s a Feast of Hongmen? We\u2019ll still eat and drink when we\u2019re there!\u201d Tang Lang felt completely assured now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m going to kill people there.\u201d Han Xiao grinned.</p><br/><p>When he saw Han Xiao\u2019s grin, Tang Lang could not help but shiver. This was the first time he and Ning Xi had seen such a smile on Han Xiao\u2019s face. It was extremely strange like the calm before the storm.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>When Lu Tingxiao finished settling everything, the sky had already darkened and it was getting closer to the time that the Rothschild clan had set on.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked to Ning Xi and sternly said, \u201cYou stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare for Yun Shen and Lu Tingxiao to be of the same opinion. \u201cWomen should stay at home. Don\u2019t be an inconvenience.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Rothschild clan was extremely terrifying even in China. This time, it was clearly a Feast of Hongmen, thus naturally Lu Tingxiao did not want her to take the risk.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going too,\u201d Ning Xi said with determined eyes.</p><br/><p>How could she let Lu Tingxiao face the danger alone?</p><br/><p>In fact, tonight, Annie would definitely be going too. How could she feel assured without getting Little Treasure\u2019s antidote?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d Lu Tingxiao frowned and said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put her palms together. \u201cI guarantee that this time, I\u2019ll be very good and I\u2019ll do as you say. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s tone did not show any signs of backing down.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s beautifully dazzling eyes suddenly turned misty. In the next second, her tears started to fall and she thrust herself into Lu Tingxiao\u2019s embrace, her little face sticking close to his chest. Her tone sounded extremely pitiful. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be worried about you! If I stay here alone, every minute and every second would be torture to me, darling. Let me go with you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Yun Shen instantly exploded, \u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Dude! Could you have a little more principles?</em></p><br/><p>This damn brat was clearly acting. Was this guy so blind that he could not tell?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was actually a little puzzled too. Her darling was just too cute! She had not even used a tenth of her skills and he already agreed!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao reminded with a stern expression, \u201cRemember what you said. No matter what happens, you\u2019re not allowed to act recklessly.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that once Ning Xi made her decision, no one could make her change her mind.</p><br/><p>Besides, for the meeting this time, he had already been putting things in order and he had made thorough preparations.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded extremely obediently. \u201cMm-hmm!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Grandfather and the Rothschild clan have grudges, so this time he\u2019ll be going to the meet up with us. Let\u2019s just sit back and wait to watch a good show!\u201d Tang Lang looked delighted, clearly riding on someone else\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>When they heard this, Feng Xiaoxiao and Tang Ye were secretly relieved too. With Han Xiao around, they felt that a lot more assured.</p></div>\n</div>"}

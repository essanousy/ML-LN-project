I have an emergency here. I've asked someone to go and get you. Follow her inside first. I'll be there soon!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's alright, Aunty, don't mind me!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not mention what had happened to Meng Linlang to avoid any conflict between her and the host. It was just a small misunderstanding of the two waitresses after all.</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi hung up, a waitress in the same uniform as the two girls earlier came over.</p><br/><p>The waitress was slightly taken aback by the girl's appearance and aura, but she maintained her professionalism and composure.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Madam Zhuang asked me to come for you. Please follow me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>On the way, the waitress peeked at the girl beside her secretly.</p><br/><p>Just who was this girl to Meng Linlang? She had never seen her before.</p><br/><p>She looked like a certain celebrity, but her aura was slightly different\u2026</p><br/><p>Maybe she just looked similar\u2026</p><br/><p>While she was curious, it was inappropriate for her to ask in her position, so she just speculated.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, the small ladies-only party was becoming lively within the resort.</p><br/><p>The two receptionists from earlier put up a huge sweet smile on their faces and walked around as they served the honorable madams.</p><br/><p>Madam Li was surrounded in the center and laughter was all around.</p><br/><p>The topics among the ladies mostly revolved around the same few things: clothes, accessories, men, and gossip. Of course, they would also try to pass on subtle hints regarding what they intended for someone else to know.</p><br/><p>It was a diplomatic affair between the ladies.</p><br/><p>Most of the time, a lady's \"diplomacy\" occupied an important position in the field of business and politics.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xueluo and Zheng Minjun arrived, they saw a whole venue of elusive people there. Most of them were the head ladies of prestigious families and the wives of high-ranking government officers.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo and Zheng Minjun were pretty renowned in the business industry, but they were both nobodies here.</p><br/><p>When they arrived, Ning Xueluo's referral briefly greeted them and returned back to chatting.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, the both of them did not mind at all as their positions were on the line after all.</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun felt really proud and excited when she saw such a classy gathering. She could not wait for the gathering to end so that she could start boasting about it to her other friends!</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo looked around and started off mingling with a wife from a rich family she knew. She slowly joined in the conversations.</p><br/><p>While she could not find the chance to talk to Madam Li yet, she understood that it was not something to be rushed. It would be considered a success if she could become familiar today because overdoing it might leave a bad impression.</p><br/><p>After a while, Ning Xueluo spotted a unique magnolia brooch on Madam Li, so she waited for an opportunity to try to strike up a conversation. \"Madam Li, the brooch on you looks really special. I wonder where you got it from. I've been struggling to find a present for my mother's birthday soon!\"</p><br/><p>Because Ning Xueluo spoke up, everyone was checking her out.</p><br/><p>This strange girl seemed outstanding and had a gentle vibe too. She was most likely from a well-off family.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

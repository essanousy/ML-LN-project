Is there a problem between you two?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cThis question, why don\u2019t you ask her? \u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter: \u201cIn the apartment that you live in, the staff said that from a few months ago you don\u2019t live there. Don\u2019t you need to explain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cNo. Where I want to live is my choice. \u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter:\u201d Where you are living right now, can you reveal it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cWith friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter: \u201cYou joining the company, does Jiang Muye know? I heard from the cast that you guys had a good relationship. Is this something he set up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cPretty good relationship and no.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter:\u201d \u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>This Ning Xi, it was too tricky, and wanting to get some gossip from her was simply impossible \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The reporter was helpless, he could only give up on the too sensitive questions, and asked another question: \u201cThis blessing to join Golden Age, what are your plans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cI want to work, to help the boss make more money. Since he helped me with my career, I will prove people wrong and that he didn\u2019t make the wrong decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter automatically thought she was referring to the boss Lu Jingli, only</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli knew that she meant his brother!</p><br/><p>Gee, if his brother heard this, his heart must have died.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, today\u2019s press conference ends here. If you have any questions, there will be private interviews. All matters relating to Ning Xi will be handled in the future by her agent Miss Lin Zhizhi.\u201d Liang Feixing got up, ending the press conference.</p><br/><p>All the reporters were full of all types of expressions. Yesterday, Starlight held a press conference for a full three hours! Through it, all kinds of condemnation was thrown at Ning Xi, but here at Golden Age Entertainment held theirs only for a short, half hour. This showed the level, who was high and who was low, it was quite obvious.</p><br/><p>When the reporters were about to finish and leave, Lu Jingli suddenly announced,</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened? Was there more news? The reporters looked around with a face full of excitement.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli, his face full of a smile as always, kindly reminded them: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you forgot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh? Forgot what? The reporters glanced at each other, at a loss. Lu Jingli started laughing, but there\u2019s not a trace of amusement in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi was so vainly scolded by you all for so many days. You guys repeated unwarranted charges and you still have nothing to say? Are you saying it\u2019s all in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard this, they had a look of embarrassment. Suddenly they started competing to apologize to Ning Xi while hating Ning Xuelo in their hearts.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ning Xi raised her eyebrows in surprise. I thought he was funny, but this little prince could get quite serious and was very good at intimidating people.</p><br/><p>However, Lu Jingli immediately reverted back to his prototype, his face in an excited expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle XiXi, my darling, my sweet, how about you cook dinner at home? I\u2019ll wash my vegetables and buy the groceries but you are responsible for cooking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi completely recovered, and thought that she really wanted to kick him and send him to heaven. In the end doesn\u2019t he understand how his words could lead to a misunderstanding?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

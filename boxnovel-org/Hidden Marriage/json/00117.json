It\u2019s raining\u2014\u2014\u201d Cries of alarm sounded from the crowd.</p><br/><p>Since the coloured lanterns were made of paper and glue, and most of the lotus lanterns were in the open, they were instantly put out by the rain.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi, who had just been about to initiate the kiss, suddenly stopped all movement because of this sudden change. She subconsciously raised a hand to cover her head, \u201cWhy did it suddenly start raining? Hey, ouch! Why does it seems like there\u2019s hail!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye had been so nervous that his heart had almost stopped; when they were forced to cut the scene, he was this close to fainting after choking on his breath, \u201cDamn it! Hasn\u2019t there been a drought recently? It hasn\u2019t rained in a few months! It\u2019s such a hot day, how could it hail!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the car, Lu Jingli had a stupefied expression.</p><br/><p>It was raining? The weather was just fine a moment ago, how could it rain? Uh, wait\u2026 Listening to the thumps coming from the car roof, it seemed like there was even hail\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, the cogs in Lu Jingli\u2019s head spun into place before he turned to his completely unsurprised and stony-faced brother, his mouth twitching. Lu Jingli was speechless, \u201cYou even made it rain\u2026 Bro, are you trying to defy nature! Also, don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve overdone it? For goodness\u2019 sake, it\u2019s hailing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that filming had stopped, the pressure around Lu Tingxiao retreated like the tide. A single word came from his thin lips: \u201cDrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Eldest Young Master.\u201d The driver started the engine, and in the dark of the night, the car silently left the scene.</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng had not expected that such a situation would occur. He wrung his hands repeatedly. If they had been able to continue filming just now, it would have been a perfect scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, forget about it, forget about it\u2026 the road to happiness is filled with setbacks! Let\u2019s wrap up for the day! However, don\u2019t leave yet, everyone. Let us all have dinner together tonight! We weren\u2019t able to give Muye a welcome dinner the last time, so we shall make up for it today!\u201d Guo Qisheng called out to the crowd.</p><br/><p>There had been a lot of drama going on in the crew recently, gathering for a dinner would help them settle the ruffled feelings they had.</p><br/><p>The crew, who had still been listless over the sudden change in the weather, instantly recovered their spirits. All of them shouted in joy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye gave a lifeless shout in reply, clearly in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi threw a towel to him, \u201cWhat kind of expression is that? Are you disappointed that you didn\u2019t get forcefully kissed by me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! I\u2019m just not happy that I have to do that scene again with you!\u201d Jiang Muye stared at her, then with an expression of warning, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have any problems tonight, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all! What problems could I have!\u201d While saying so, Ning Xi sent a message to Lu Tingxiao to inform him as usual.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye stared at her phone secretly, looking at what she was sending, then realising that something was wrong, \u201cLittle Ning Xi, when did you change your Weibo nickname?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her nickname had changed from \u2018My Lonely Empty Loss\u2019 to \u2018Little Sugar Xi\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s because of Lu Tingxiao.\u201d Ning Xi replied.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s pupils abruptly contracted, \u201cLu Tingxiao made you change it? You changed it just because he told you to!? That nickname that you used for so many years? The one that you refused to change no matter how much I made fun of it because you were too lazy? You changed it the moment he told you to!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, \u201cCould you stop getting so agitated over nothing? He didn\u2019t make me change it, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you change it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was because he didn\u2019t get me to change it and he even said that this nickname was pretty good. He wanted me to help him change his nickname to something similar!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201c\u2026\u201d Damn! His uncle had some skill at picking up girls! Even something like this could work?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if a tough guy like me uses this kind of shocking name, but as the CEO of a big corporation, if I somehow influenced him into using Martian language, wouldn\u2019t that be a sin? So I had to somehow persuade him for a long time that Martian language is already outdated, and to prove that, I changed my nickname!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

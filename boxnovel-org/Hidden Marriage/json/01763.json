However, at this moment, a dark mist filled up Ling Zhizhi's office within the Glory World Entertainment office building.</p><br/><p>There were too many events for Ning Xi to attend lately. While she could reject some of them, the events to promote her movie and the awards ceremonies were not something she could just say no to.</p><br/><p>As of now, Ning Xi had already been absent from all the promotional events for \"Mother\", the Golden Orchid Awards, the Golden Deer Awards, and even the Golden Phoenix Awards yesterday.</p><br/><p>With the help of Jiang Xingzhou and Song Lin, she could somewhat get away from the events of \"Mother\". The Golden Orchid Awards and the Golden Deer Awards allowed managers to receive the award in place of the artiste, but the Golden Phoenix Awards had strict rules that the award recipient had to attend in order to receive the award. Otherwise, the award would not be granted.</p><br/><p>Although her name would still be maintained as the winner, Ning Xi had left an unpleasant impression on all the judges and fans by being absent for such an important event.</p><br/><p>Even if she had given perfect excuses for Ning Xi in the past three months, under such circumstances, no matter how perfect the justifications were, she could not drag it on any longer. She could not give any more excuses for her vanishing for three whole months\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi's mobile phone and office phone did not stop ringing off the hook. Xiao Tao was just handling the necessary stuff with the media, while Ling Zhizhi took care of all the other matters on her own.</p><br/><p>Looking at the countless headlines about Ning Xi, the numerous invitations from various award events, the overwhelming amount of scripts and adverts, Ling Zhizhi was under immense pressure.</p><br/><p>In the end, she had underestimated Ning Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>This time, she could not suppress it anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a loud knock on her door.</p><br/><p>The CEO of Glory World Entertainment came in agitatedly and flung a stash of newspaper on Ling Zhizhi's table. \"Ling Zhizhi! What are you doing? Is this how you work? Where is she?! Where is Ning Xi?!\"</p><br/><p>All the newspapers were talking about Ning Xi's absence in the big events. The media and fans looked back at Ning Xi's schedule and realized that Ning Xi had vanished for three months. Rumors were spreading on the Net\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I thought you learned your lesson based on Leng Manyun's incident. What about this time? It's happened again! What kind of manager can't manage their artiste?!\" Yi Xudong was extremely enraged.</p><br/><p>However, he was not to be blamed.</p><br/><p>With Ning Xi's current popularity, 90% of the company's profits came from Ning Xi alone, yet at this very crucial moment, she had gone missing. Not only did she miss all the important events, she had also skipped all the important advertorial collaboration! Those were all money!</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had started letting go and had left Glory World in his hands. Now that he had risen to the position of CEO, he could not afford to let such a huge mistake happen before he could secure his position.</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi pursed his lips as though she were absorbing Yi Xudong's anger. \"I'm sorry.\"</p><br/><p>She understood Yi Xudong's anger, but she could not tell him the truth, so those were the only two words she could say to him now.</p><br/><p>Yi Xudong became even angrier after she apologized. \"What's the use of apologizing?! Look for her! Do you think the investors and important partners will wait for you forever? Let me tell you, our company doesn't need artistes like her who ignore the policy and contract regulations! Gather all the scripts and collaboration projects under Ning Xi and pass it to me! If she won't do it, many others will!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She was his real granddaughter!</p><br/><p>\"You old man, how is that plotting? My grandson is handsome and filial, I wouldn\u2019t even have thought about it if your granddaughter wasn\u2019t pretty and lacked affinity!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, only now you realize that my granddaughter is pretty! Not everyone is worthy of her, show me your grandson\u2019s picture first!\" He had actually met Xi Boyi\u2019s grandson a few years ago but who knew how he looked like now?</p><br/><p>\"It might be you who\u2019s plotting something after you see his picture!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi groaned, \"Ugh\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Why did conversations always go the other way?</p><br/><p>Did the elders always have such active thought patterns?</p><br/><p>Probably not, 80% of the time when elder people gathered together, their conversations would end up with this topic\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait, that was not the main point.

Ning Xi wasn\u2019t being serious with all those people she was dating overseas. She would dump them when she was done with no hesitation at all. However, this Su Yan is probably the only man she has ever truly loved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression turned even uglier after his explanation.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was somewhat speechless at this. He thought inwardly, you guys aren\u2019t even together yet, what right do you have to massacre everyone she\u2019s ever dated?</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, even if you\u2019re prepared to stick around and wait until she falls in love with you, at least bring her over to Golden Age first. It\u2019s so inconvenient that she\u2019s in our rival company, Starlight! From what I know, she\u2019s being bullied terribly by Ning Xueluo there!\u201d Lu Jingli grumbled.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao watched the girl who had become quiet after hugging Little Treasure with an unreadable expression, \u201cIt\u2019s not time yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finally reaching their home, a problem arose as they were getting out of the car.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had spotted the silvery white sports car at the side, and her eyes had lit up like a hungry wolf. She clung to the car and refused to leave, and her expression was like a little girl who had finally found her dream man, \u201cOh! Little White! My darling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression was changing furiously like traffic lights.</p><br/><p>He had gone through such a hard time fetching her back, even risking his reputation to bring her out of the female restroom. However, she hadn\u2019t shown any gratitude, and had even called him an evil demon king. Now she was actually hugging a car and calling it her darling?</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026 Bro, surely you\u2019re not jealous of a car! See, why did you just have to drive this car out? Little Xixi loved racing cars when she was overseas, and she\u2019s actually a pro at racing! Of course she wouldn\u2019t have any resistance against the number one sports car in the world!\u201d Lu Jingli was gloating in his brother\u2019s misfortune.</p><br/><p>However, he soon found that there was someone was even worse off than Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>That person was Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his personal nickname \u2018darling\u2019 had been stolen by a car, the little guy was close to tears.</p><br/><p>However, the cause of all the trouble, Ning Xi, was still touching the car all over with infatuation, \u201cDarling you\u2019re too too too cool\u2026 You\u2019re simply too irresistible! I want to marry you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s knuckles cracked, and he had the sudden urge to curse.</p><br/><p>She had reacted like he was a rampaging wild beast when he had proposed to her, but now she was actually proposing to a freaking car?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao rolled up his sleeves one by one, \u201cOld Zhang, bring me a hammer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli, who had been laughing until he was out of breath, immediately jumped up, \u201cDon\u2019t! Bro, calm down! This car is almost 20 million yuan! If you don\u2019t want it, then give it to me! I\u2019ll bring it away right now! I guarantee that it won\u2019t appear in front of your eyes ever again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he said so, Lu Jingli\u2019s whole world flipped over as he was thrown over the shoulder by the frail-looking Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho dares to touch my Little White!\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s beautiful face was currently full of murderous intent, as if she would kill even the gods.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli held onto his injured waist, \u201cGood sir, please spare me, I was wrong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like this girl was a seasoned practitioner of judo. He felt like he had lost half his life just being thrown by her!</p><br/><p>After getting rid of the threat, Ning Xi immediately dove into the driver\u2019s seat and hugged the steering wheel, \u201cLittle White, don\u2019t be scared\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Young Master, this\u2026\u201d Old Zhang, who had been squeezed out of the driver\u2019s seat, was stupefied.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pinched the center of his brows and waved him away, indicating for him to leave.</p><br/><p>He looked at his son, \u201cLittle Treasure, it\u2019s late. Go back first and sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure, who had been immersed in the feeling of losing the affection of his favourite person, immediately shook his head like a rattle.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t get angry, but calmly spoke, \u201cYou should know that girls don\u2019t like showing their worst sides to the person they care most about.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person they care most about\u2026</p><br/><p>Little Treasure looked like he was in deep thought for a few seconds, then he obediently turned and left.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s eyes bulged out, \u201cBro, you\u2019re too shameless! You\u2019re lying to kids!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I want to let you feel the burning of this giant mega-watt light bulb!\u201d</p><br/><p>The icy cold gaze of his dear brother pierced deep into his bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m leaving, I\u2019m leaving\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli turned back to look at them dubiously right before leaving.</p><br/><p>Leaving this couple and that sports car alone, nothing was going to happen, right\u2026</p><br/><p>Heh heh, that 63x zoom long range camera was going to come in handy!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Just slightly lower than Ning Xi's.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian patted Lu Tingxiao\u2019s shoulder and sighed, \"Brother! I\u2019m impressed! This is probably the toughest score you\u2019ve hit in your lifetime!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao got a 6.2...which was even more surprising than a 10 pointer...</p><br/><p>Ning Xi ignored Mo Lingtian\u2019s teasing as she happily went up to Lu Tingxiao to gush, \"Boss, you\u2019re so sharp!\"</p><br/><p>As Lu Tingxiao was about to say something, his phone rang. It was a call from home.</p><br/><p>Any sign of expression was wiped off his face as he turned to Ning Xi. \"You can play on your own first, I\u2019ll go and pick up a call.\"</p><br/><p>He then signaled to Mo Lingtian, asking him to take care of Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian gave him a shooing gesture. \"Just go and pick up your phone call quickly! Go!\"</p><br/><p>The moment Lu Tingxiao left, the people who were wary of him suddenly spoke in much louder voices.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s hilarious! Even the girl who didn\u2019t know anything within our group got a 7 and Lu Tingxiao's girl dares to claim that she\u2019s good at it?\" Lu Xinyan said scornfully.</p><br/><p>Another girl shrugged. \"Maybe it\u2019s already good enough for her! At least she hit the target! I\u2019m quite surprised that she didn\u2019t miss!\"</p><br/><p>Why would Lu Tingxiao be with such a useless woman? I\u2019m really curious! Someone go and ask him!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not going to! I\u2019m just being polite because of Lu Tingxiao but I refuse to be friendly with her!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi calmly wiped her gun while listening to their discussion. These people were from the wealthy circle of Imperial. They were either the heirs of a wealthy organization or the prince or princesses of some high-ranking government officials. They were just being fairly nice to Ning Xi because of Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>At that moment, someone told Guan Ziyao, \"Ziyao, you and Mo Lingtian are closer to Bro Xiao. Why don't you try to talk to him and tell him not to be fooled by a woman like her!\"</p><br/><p>\"He will eventually find out himself,\" Guan Ziyao replied.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019d be too late. The moment he finds out, he would\u2019ve been deceived!\"</p><br/><p>As Lu Xinyan listened to them, her face turned bright red. She felt embarrassed and could not accept the fact that her perfect cousin was being fooled by this woman\u2026</p><br/><p>Boiling with anger, Lu Xinyan could not hold it in anymore. She walked up to Ning Xi and demanded, \"I don\u2019t care what did you do to be with my cousin! Tell me what it takes in order for you to leave him!\"</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian quickly stood in between them and tried to defuse the situation. \"Hey, what are you doing? We\u2019re here to have some fun! Stop making a fuss!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not making a fuss! Seriously, how is this woman worthy of my cousin?\"</p><br/><p>As Mo Lingtian was trying to convince Lu Xinyan to calm down, Ning Xi curled her fingers around the gun in her hand and blinked innocently. \"Leaving your cousin? It\u2019s easy! You just have to defeat me!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

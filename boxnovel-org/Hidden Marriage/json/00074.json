It was Ning Xi\u2019s performance in particular that had completely brought them into the scene, and washed away all their bias against her.</p><br/><p>The fans who had been wishing from the start that Ning Xi wouldn\u2019t touch their dearest idol, had now changed to fervently wishing that she would hurry up and do it. Seeing her about to do it, they were as excited as if they were the ones doing the deed.</p><br/><p>Of course, after getting back to their senses, they were dismissive of Ning Xi as usual. All of them surrounded Jiang Muye, showing their concern and asking after him, while praising his acting skills.</p><br/><p>Today, other than Jia Qingqing, the one who was the most depressed was most likely Zhao Sizhou.</p><br/><p>He had previously occupied the highest position in the crew, and had been enjoying the warm welcome of the girls. Now that Jiang Muye was here, all their attention had been sucked over to him, while he sat out here in the cold.</p><br/><p>The happiest person was naturally the director.</p><br/><p>Today, Ning Xi and Jiang Muye tried out a few scenes, and all of them ended up extremely successful. The chemistry between the two was as if they had collaborated together over a hundred times.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s day could be summed up in two phrases: surging forward with great momentum, life after calamity.</p><br/><p>When they were about to wrap up for the day, Jiang Muye was surrounded by a group of people who wanted to treat him to dinner and give him a warm welcome. Ning Xi was packing up her things when the phone in her bag rang.</p><br/><p>The phone\u2019s display showed that it was Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>It was Lu Jingli who had forcefully saved his number into her phone just a few days ago.</p><br/><p>What was this fellow doing, calling her at this time?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi showed suspicion on her face as she hurriedly looked for a corner to take the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Second Young Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello\u2026 Xiao\u2026 Xi\u2026 Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s voice sounded as if he had completely run out of strength, as if his soul had been sucked out of his body\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was a little speechless, \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened\u2026 I was about to ask you just what happened! What did you do to my brother last night?\u201d Lu Jingli exploded as he interrogated.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was completely confused, \u201cAh? What do you mean? What could I possibly have done to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t do anything to him, then why is he in a raging temper today? He\u2019s been holding a meeting since 8am until now, it\u2019s been twelve whole hours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2019s your company\u2019s business, and it has nothing to do with me, right? Maybe he has a lot to clear after returning to work from such a long break?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. I\u2019ve already known my brother for so long. I know what he\u2019s thinking with just one look. This definitely has something to do with you! You\u2019re the one who caused this! He\u2019s about to torture everyone in this company to death!\u201d Lu Jingli was absolutely certain that it was her fault.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was really wronged, she spoke with a helpless expression, \u201cI really didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>The only thing that had happened last night, was going to the airport to pick up Jiang Muye, and meeting Lu Tingxiao while showering at Jiang Muye\u2019s house\u2026</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me that was it?</p><br/><p>But he seemed to be normal after that?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t care! It must be because of you! This was your fault, so it\u2019s your responsibility to settle it! Otherwise we won\u2019t let you off after we die and turn into ghosts! The chief of our finance department already fainted from the torture, his ghost must be on its way to find you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What the heck! What was this? She had been shot out of the blue\u2026</p><br/><p>What was she going to do now?</p><br/><p>Did she have any way to save them?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this a huge joke?</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi was worrying her head off, she received a MMS.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had sent her two photos.</p><br/><p>One was of an unconscious man getting dragged away by the ambulance. The other was of a meeting room, and everyone sitting at that meeting table had a terrified expression like they were about to face interrogation and execution. The great demon king sitting at the head of the table was practically the living King of Hell judging them!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could even feel that sinister, cold aura through the photos\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

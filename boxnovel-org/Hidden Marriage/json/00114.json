One of the clips shown was the bondage scene we shot the other day. After that, they changed from anti-fans into your most fervent fans. Are they really that happy watching me get bullied?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d So that\u2019s what happened.</p><br/><p>Very few fans infatuated with celebrities would ever try to get in contact with their idols in real life, as their chances weren\u2019t very high. Thus, movies and the like became the way fans lived their fantasies.</p><br/><p>If a female star was going to act in a scene with your male idol, your first reaction might be a little jealousy. Especially if that female star acted terribly, you would feel that your idol had suffered injustice, thereby creating a lot of resistance. However, on the contrary, fans would also pretend to be the person acting alongside their idol and gain a lot of satisfaction from it.</p><br/><p>That was Ning Xi\u2019s current situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuye, Muye. I heard that you guys have a lot of intimate scenes. Is that true? Do you have any kissing scenes?\u201d A fan asked excitedly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye raised an eyebrow, \u201cThere is. In fact, we have one today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAHHHHHH!\u201d A wave of excited screaming rose from the fans.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we watch? Can we? Can we?\u201d The little girls asked while clamouring.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scene we\u2019re filming today will be outdoors, so you should be able to see it from the fence. However, it\u2019ll be pretty far away, so you might not be able to see clearly.\u201d Jiang Muye replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine, we all came prepared!\u201d The girls all brought out the must-have item for fans: binoculars.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>With so many people watching, the pressure was piling on top of her like a mountain!</p><br/><p>In the break room.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cSpeaking of the kissing scene, exactly which scene was it?\u201d Too many things had happened recently and the order of filming had changed a lot. She only had a rough idea, but had not been informed of the specifics.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye flipped through the script excitedly, \u201cIt\u2019s the scene with the flower lanterns, I asked the director last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi recalled the plot, \u201cThe flower lantern festival? Isn\u2019t that the scene where Meng Changge and Sun Huanqing have their first kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s that one!\u201d After having said so, Jiang Muye\u2019s eyebrows raised as he moved close to her cautiously and took a sniff, \u201cDid you remember what I said yesterday? You didn\u2019t eat anything you shouldn\u2019t have, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi slapped him away, \u201cDo I look that unprofessional to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember what you just said, if you play me, I\u2019m going to tell the director!\u201d Jiang Muye stared at her with distrust. He had been tricked too many times by this fellow, he completely didn\u2019t dare to relax his guard.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, \u201cHow old are you? Are you still going to tell the teacher! Aren\u2019t you childish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye harrumphed and turned away, \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you anymore, I\u2019m going to research how I\u2019m going to act in the scene!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned his chair over in a single move, \u201cWhat are you going to research for? Anyway, I\u2019ll be the one forcefully kissing you by then! Come here, I have something to ask you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201c\u2026\u201d Damn it, couldn\u2019t he research how to get forcefully kissed then?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to ask?\u201d Jiang Muye asked huffily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are they going to do with the Jia Qingqing\u2019s role?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019re going to swap her out. I heard Ming-ge say that her replacement is going to be someone from our Golden Age Entertainment. It seems like it\u2019ll be a new singer! She\u2019s rather pretty, but she doesn\u2019t have any acting experience at all, it\u2019s going to be tough to watch! That\u2019s right, did you hear about what happened to Jia Qingqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Jia Qingqing?\u201d Ning Xi did not understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else could have happened? This incident got so out of hand that her sugar daddy\u2019s wife found out. The wife hired people to strip Jia Qingqing on the streets and beat her up, then announced that she had to scram out of the capital or she would kill Jia Qingqing the next time they met! I was still worried that that woman would do something to you after getting forced into a corner, but it looks like I don\u2019t have to worry anymore!\u201d As Jiang Muye continued talking, he started to realise that something felt strange, \u201cNing Xi, why do I feel that everything happened way too smoothly?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the director\u2019s voice sounded from outside\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, Muye, go put on your costumes! It\u2019ll be your turn for the next scene!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why did a part of her tongue hurt? Did she bite herself while dreaming last night\u2026?</p><br/><p>Was it too savage that she had bitten herself\u2026</p><br/><p>At breakfast, everything was normal.</p><br/><p>Seeing how Lu Tingxiao was dressed, it seemed like he was going back to work today. He was impeccably attired in Western-style clothing, sitting there like an aristocrat having his coffee and reading the newspapers. His expression was as cold and distant as usual, as if nothing had happened last night.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi heaved a sigh of relief, and somehow felt that she was being too sensitive.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao might harbour some sort of vague feelings towards her, but it wasn\u2019t to the point that he would get jealous for her, right? Especially with his own nephew\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression was rather normal, but the little bun\u2019s was not.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, the little bun had been carrying a stiff expression and had been sulking about, as if someone had snatched something away from him.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi placed a steamed dumpling in the little bun\u2019s bowl and inquired caringly, \u201cDarling, what happened? Are you unhappy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun glanced at his dear daddy, who was pretending as if nothing had happened, and he grew even angrier. However, upon remembering that Auntie Xiao Xi loved seeing his smile the most, he worked hard to raise the corners of his lips, indicating that he was fine.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m so angry, but I need to keep my smile on!</p><br/><p>After seeing this, Ning Xi finally stopped worrying. She quickly finished her breakfast, \u201cThen I\u2019m leaving first, both of you, take your time with eating!\u201d</p><br/><p>Today was the day the second male lead would be coming to the set. Thus, it would be best if she reached there early.</p><br/><p>As she was about to take her bag and leave, little bun had walked to her side at some point, and his little hand gripped onto her clothes.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that she didn\u2019t understand, the little bun\u2019s face was full of grievance. With an expression as if he had lost her favour, he was about to cry out loud.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head and thought for a long while, but couldn\u2019t understand what she had done wrong. Finally, she could only send a pleading gaze for help to Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao shot a glance at her, then reminded her in a calm tone, \u201cYou forgot to give him the goodbye kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh oh sorry!\u201d Ning Xi hit her head, and finally remembered.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure waved bye to Auntie Xiao Xi, then turned around and faced his dear daddy, that cute little face immediately carried an extremely angry expression. He seemed to be saying, \u2018Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re forgiven just because you helped me just now!\u2019 with his expression.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao acted as if he didn\u2019t notice his son\u2019s anger, and sipped some coffee in a calm and collected manner, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to say. If you want to talk to me, then speak up or write it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was even angrier upon hearing so.</p><br/><p>Even with Ning Xi\u2019s help, his communication ability was only at the level of writing simple words, expressions and punctuation. He had never written a long sentence before, not to mention opening his mouth to speak.</p><br/><p>Finally, filled with rage, he wrote a single word in English on his notepad: Thief.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao glanced at that word from the side of his eyes, and pretended not to understand, \u201cWhat? We\u2019ve been robbed?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Little Treasure was so mad that his cheeks were puffed up. Burying his head into his notepad, he wrote quite a few words agitatedly, and it was even in Chinese: \u201cYou stole away Auntie Xiao Xi last night!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at that row of words and seeing that Little Treasure had written a proper sentence, grammar and all, Lu Tingxiao was finally satisfied. Putting down his newspaper, he looked at his son and asked with a significant tone, \u201cYou don\u2019t want Auntie Xiao Xi to become my wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMine!\u201d Little Treasure wrote on the notepad.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised his brows, \u201cUnfortunately, the two of you aren\u2019t compatible. You\u2019re younger than her by 19 years. Don\u2019t tell me you want her to wait that long for you to grow up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure lowered his head and started drawing again, and drew an egg that had gone bad.</p><br/><p>Looking at that life-like rotten egg, a trace of a smile appeared on Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face, \u201cI\u2019m speaking the truth, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he finished saying so, he paused for a moment before continuing with a bewitching tone, \u201cHowever, if she becomes my wife, it\u2019ll be different. She\u2019ll become your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother\u2026</p><br/><p>Hearing that word, the little bun froze for a moment. He looked down in deep thought, his inner struggle and wavering thoughts clear on his little face\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

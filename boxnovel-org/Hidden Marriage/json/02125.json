Hand over the antidote, or else, you won\u2019t be able to leave today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie\u2019s gaze swept across Tang Lang, Tang Ye, and Feng Xiaoxiao indifferently. She suddenly sneered. \u201cJust you three little fishes? You might as well come at me together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAltogether? And even calling us little fish! Wow! Little brat! You really talk big!\u201d Tang Lang was so angry that he laughed.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell, she really looked down on him!</p><br/><p>Even if Annie might be skilled, he could feel that familiar air from her which meant that they were the same kind, yet she had said such words. Was she not being too arrogant?</p><br/><p>As Little Treasure was being resuscitated inside and his condition became more and more critical, Tang Lang could not care much. He immediately charged towards Annie.</p><br/><p>In the next second, there was a loud sound. Bam!</p><br/><p>Tang Lang\u2026 flew to the wall from a slap.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang held his chest that was in pain. \u201cWhat the f*ck?\u201d</p><br/><p>A single-move wipe out?</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao and Tang Ye were dumbfounded when they saw this. They only reacted after a few seconds and quickly followed up to charge.</p><br/><p>In the end, barely ten seconds had passed when the fight ended.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao spit out a mouthful of blood. Eeven Tang Ye had to take three steps back as he clutched his chest that was struck by her palm.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang\u2019s eyes almost popped out. \u201cBloody hell! What the f*ck?! How did that happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was illogical!</p><br/><p>The three of them could guess that Annie was quite skilled, but they never would have thought that she could be strong to this extent.</p><br/><p>In just a little over ten seconds, she had dealt with Tang Ye, Tang Lang, and Feng Xiaoxiao, the three first-rate masters altogether. What was going on?</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi came out and saw that Tang Ye, Tang Lang, and Feng Xiaoxiao had all combined forces, yet were defeated, her expression changed completely.</p><br/><p>No one here could handle Annie!</p><br/><p>Then, what were they going to do about Little Treasure\u2019s antidote?</p><br/><p>Because Ning Xi was so anxious, there was a burning pain in her chest. She quickly said, \u201cAnnie, you said that this matter has nothing to do with me. Okay, I won\u2019t care about you and the Lu family\u2019s grudges, but Little Treasure is my son. I can\u2019t just watch him die and do nothing. Now, it\u2019s a matter between the two of us. What do we need to do for you to hand over the antidote?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want the antidote? Sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes had just lit up when she heard Annie continue, \u201cDefeat me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang held his chest that was burning from pain as he cursed under his breath, \u201cBloody hell, what\u2019s the difference whether you said that or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi clenched her hands into fists. \u201cOkay! Defeat you? I\u2019ll fight with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang cried out, \u201cLittle Junior Sister, are you insane?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression changed ever-so-slightly. \u201cXiao Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen frowned too.</p><br/><p>There was no hint of warmth in Annie\u2019s eyes at all. \u201cYou\u2019re no match for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi slowly took off the outer layer of clothing on her and casually threw it to the ground. \u201cHow would you know if we don\u2019t try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie was silent as she looked straight at her for three seconds and then finally said, \u201cOkay, take three blows from me. If, after three hits, you can still stand upright, I\u2019ll give you the antidote.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang immediately cried out in alarm, \u201cWhat?! Bloody hell, Tang Xi, are you trying to die?! Her one strike almost killed me. Your little body is going to be crushed by her one hit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression instantly darkened when he heard this. \u201cXiao Xi, don\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Tingxiao, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t obey you this time.\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s gaze was extremely earnest as she looked towards the man before her. \u201cYou know this is the only way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was on the verge of death. Annie could leave anytime and none of them could stop her.</p></div>\n</div>"}

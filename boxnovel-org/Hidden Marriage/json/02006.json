Everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo and Han Zixuan\u2019s fans were instantly like hungry wolves that had been starved for days as they pounced over the pictures with bloodlust-filled eyes.</p><br/><p>[F*ck! What an adulterous couple! Ning Xi\u2019s moronic fans, what do you have to say now!? This is cold hard evidence! Who else dares to say that our Zixuan is starting rumors and creating trouble?]</p><br/><p>[Seducing a married man, bewitching him to take back all of the authority the wife has, poaching her over, and leaving a pregnant woman all alone at home late at night while the two of them hide alone in the little garden to secretly meet up and whisper sweet nothings! How shameless!]</p><br/><p>[Zixuan was just fighting for her friend\u2019s justice, and she got attacked by Ning Xi\u2019s stupid fans! Thankfully, justice will always be served!]</p><br/><p>[Initially, I still thought that Zheng Anru\u2019s words had gone a little overboard, but now that I think about it, she really said it too lightly. To compare someone like this to our Zixuan is really an insult to Zixuan!]</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t she just someone who climbed up the ladder with her looks and body? She hid it too well before and deceived everyone! Now, the truth is finally out!]</p><br/><p>[Ning Xi\u2019s brainless fans, why aren\u2019t you guys saying anything anymore? Come out and justify, won\u2019t you?!]</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Glory World Entertainment.</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing and Xu Tao were closely monitoring the way things had progressed online.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao sneered, \u201cTsk, Han Zixuan did indeed prepare backup!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing looked up and shot him a look. \u201cNo shit? Otherwise, would she have dare dto immediately tear things apart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao yawned and was bored stiff as he said, \u201cBoring! Now, do we just post up the things from our end?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liang Feixing heard him, he looked towards Ning Xi on the sofa opposite him. \u201cNing Xi, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi retrieved her gaze from the computer screen. One of her hands lightly supported her tilted head while the fingers on her other hand tapped on the arm of the chair. \u201cWe\u2019ll obviously post it, but not that soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she said the last words, there was an ice-cold glint that flashed in Ning Xi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao quickly asked, \u201cMy queen, what do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stopped what her fingers were doing, then she looked towards Xu Tao and said word for word, \u201cClean up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Previously, because she had woken up, everything had to start from scratch and Glory World was in a terrible state too, so she could only choose to passively face attacks. However, now, it was time to get rid of Han Zixuan.</p><br/><p>When Xu Tao heard these domineering words, his eyes instantly lit up. \u201cYour Majesty, you\u2019re formidable and powerful! You\u2019re right! Forget it after slandering someone? Not that easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Liang Feixing said in a lowered voice, \u201cI\u2019ve been secretly investigating Han Zixuan in this period of time. However, she\u2019s been very careful. It\u2019s been so long, yet I didn\u2019t manage to find anything useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Otherwise, he would have made a move to completely get rid of her by now. There was no way he would let her continue messing around.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao nodded and echoed, \u201cThat is indeed so. There\u2019s a lot of dirt on Han Zixuan, but without evidence, it\u2019d be useless no matter what we say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes fell onto Xu Tao. She asked, \u201cBro Tao, aren\u2019t you forgetting Yin Youyou?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xu Tao heard her, he was confused. \u201cYin Youyou?\u201d</p><br/><p>What did this have to do with Yin Youyou?</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Han Zixuan\u2019s personality, why was it that after she jumped ships, she was nice enough to watch out for Yin Youyou?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p></div>\n</div>"}

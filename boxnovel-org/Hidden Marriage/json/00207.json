With me in the hospital, if she decided to frame Ning Xi, I would not doubt</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if this reason is not plausible, what about your injuries?\u201d Su Yan continued to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I was all right at the beginning, and my parents were so worried about me I had been staying in the hospital for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cBrother, you know, that time I was really physically and mentally exhausted, my body was very uncomfortable every day, how can they slander me like this! \u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan was so shocked his face was numb, causing Ning Xuelo to feel a bit of deep pain, \u201cXuelo, how\u2026.can I continue to trust you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo crying with tears running down her face, tightly pulled his hand, looking at his eyes as like he was her salvation,\u201d Yan brother!

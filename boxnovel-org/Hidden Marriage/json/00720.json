Netizens aren\u2019t fools. They just need some guidance and they\u2019ll know what happened. For incidents like these, happening once might be a coincidence. The second time might be an accident, but what do you think the netizens would think about the third time?</p><br/><p>\"No matter how well she handled it, she's surely got a hand in this. Ning Xueluo\u2019s kind and gentle public image will fade away slowly. If something similar happens in the future, the netizens will have our back.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi squinted her eyes and set her mouth in a determined line. \"Karma! She deserves it!\"</p><br/><p>As Ling Zhizhi spoke, she opened her drawer. \"Right, there\u2019s something for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is this?\" Ning Xi took a look at it and was surprised. \"A car key?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, the company just gave you one. The movie is airing soon and you\u2019ll be needing a car in this period of time.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! They gave me a BMW?\"</p><br/><p>And it was one of the high-end models, worth at least a few million dollars.</p><br/><p>\"This is a celebrity\u2019s reputation at stake. We can't have you looking too badly. Plus, you\u2019ve been performing well and you got yourself two endorsements aside from your casting in 'The World'.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, Sis Zhizhi and Starlight Entertainment!, I\u2019ll continue to work hard!\" Ning Xi was over the moon about this unexpected news. \"Sis Zhizhi, the promotion for the movie is finished now. Is there any more work?\"</p><br/><p>\"I was about to tell you. At 8pm tomorrow night, Noble will be having their new perfume conference at Imperial Knight Hotel. Remember to be there on time!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright!\"</p><br/><p>\"Also, there\u2019s another matter\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What is it?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m thinking if I should let Xiao Tao stay with you, it\u2019s easier for her to take care of you that way.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s heart was throbbing with anxiety. It would be all over if Xiao Tao saw her and Lu Tingxiao together.</p><br/><p>\"Uh, I think...it\u2019s fine! I\u2019ll be able to take care of myself! I\u2019m actually used to staying alone and it might be inconvenient if another person stayed with me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright then.\" Ling Zhizhi did not push further.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed in relief in her heart.</p><br/><p>As they were talking, someone knocked urgently on the door.</p><br/><p>Lei Ming came in hurriedly. \"Zhizhi...oh, Ning Xi\u2019s here as well! Great! Have any of you seen Jiang Muye?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shook her head. \"Nope! Why?\"</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi replied, \"I haven't seen him.\"</p><br/><p>Lei Ming looked like doomsday had arrived for him. \"Muye's gone missing since yesterday! I can\u2019t contact him at all!\"</p><br/><p>\"Did he just hide somewhere and play his video games?\" Ning Xi said.</p><br/><p>Lei Ming glanced at his watch. \"At first, that's what I thought, but today he\u2019s having a signing ceremony for an endorsement. A ten million endorsement! I\u2019ve been liaising with them for over three months, but I can\u2019t even contact him now! I\u2019m going to die\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched. \"Ten million...that brat\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"How long until the ceremony?\" Ling Zhizhi asked.</p><br/><p>\"Only two hours left! Please! Help me! Where could he be? I\u2019ve gone to the places he usually hangs out at! He wasn\u2019t there!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged. \"Bro Ming, I\u2019m afraid that I can\u2019t be of much help here. Surely you know all the places that I know!\"</p><br/><p>She got to know Jiang Muye overseas, so she did not know where he would usually be back here in China.</p><br/><p>\"Zhizhi, I know you\u2019re busy! Please! Help me! If this endorsement gets canceled, then I better go and jump off the building!\" pleaded the big-sized Lei Ming with the most pitiful face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

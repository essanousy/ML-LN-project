He must have been so excited in the beginning, only to experience cold loneliness when the day came, followed by panic when he couldn\u2019t reach her\u2026</p><br/><p>How painful must the whole process have been to him?</p><br/><p>Upon thinking that, Ning Xi felt as though a knife was being twisted in her heart. She hugged Little Treasure, not wanting to let him go for even a second.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t want to disturb the two of them, but for the sake of that small trace of brotherly affection left in him, he still issued a reminder, \u201cNing Xi, ask Little Treasure to recall those robots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhhh right\u2026\u201d It was only then that Ning Xi remembered that there was a horde of fierce robots revolting and tearing down the residence. Lu Jingli\u2019s arm was still stuck in their hands!</p><br/><p>Thus, she quickly spoke to the little bun, \u201cDarling, could you call them back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure nodded. He then turned to face the screen and his stubby little fingers flew nimbly across the keyboard.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gasped in amazement as she watched. With adoration written all over her face, she exclaimed, \u201cDarling, how are you this clever? I thought you only knew how to draw! You\u2019re really super, super, super clever! I spent the past few years studying everything I could like a maniac. However, this was the only thing I couldn\u2019t learn for the life of me. What the heck is coding, C and C++? They\u2019re practically the stuff of my nightmares. You\u2019re only five years old, yet you\u2019re already such a pro! You\u2019re a genius!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the little bun\u2019s expression was still wooden, the light in his eyes had brightened considerably.</p><br/><p>However, Lu Tingxiao standing off to the side couldn\u2019t continue watching. He sighed gently, \u201cNing Xi, you shouldn\u2019t be praising him in this situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 right!\u201d Ning Xi finally remembered that the little bun had caused a huge mess.</p><br/><p>She scratched her head awkwardly and looked at Lu Tingxiao, \u201cAre you going to ask me to tell him not to do this again? He really has followed through with what he promised me previously. Although he doesn\u2019t go on hunger strikes or throw things around anymore, he turned to more sophisticated methods in the end! What if he comes up with an even more sophisticated plan next time if I tell him not to do this again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao, \u201c\u2026\u201d That was actually quite possible, considering this was Little Treasure they were talking about.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spread out her hands in helplessness, \u201cIn short, I think it\u2019s better not to scold him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Truthfully, she was being selfish. She didn\u2019t want to criticise the little bun given the circumstances today. She loved him so dearly and she couldn\u2019t even dote on him enough. How could she bear to say any harsh words to him?</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t force the issue in the end.</p><br/><p>For the most part, his principles were as solid as floating clouds when he was with Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>The three of them rode the golf cart back to the entrance of the residence.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared in astonishment at the magnificent scene before her: the troublemaking robots had formed two neat columns lining the path, as if welcoming them home.</p><br/><p>The only mood killer was anguished howling coming from the side\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, why did you guys take so long?! My arm was freaking dislocated while waiting for you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a dislocated arm, do you really need to cry like that?\u201d Ning Xi rolled her eyes and jumped out. She pushed down his arm, giving it a tug and lift, which resulted in a \u2018pop\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cOW\u2014\u2014\u201d Lu Jingli shrieked like a pig getting slaughtered.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi patted his arm, \u201cStop howling! It\u2019s healed already. Try it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lu Jingli blinked and moved his arm a little. It really was fine now.</p><br/><p>However, he still muttered, unconvinced, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have set it back crooked, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! I\u2019m very experienced at fixing dislocated arms!\u201d Ning Xi replied with total confidence.</p><br/><p>Doubt was written all over Lu Jingli\u2019s face, \u201cMay I ask how you got so much experience with this sort of thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cBecause I used to fight with Jiang Muye quite often. His arm got dislocated quite a few times, and I always realigned it for him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Are you sure you were fighting and you weren\u2019t just beating him up one-sidedly?</p><br/><p>He was really worried for his bro\u2019s future. Was his bro going to become a victim of domestic abuse in the future? Forget it, what was he worrying about? Even if his bro was abused, his bro would definitely receive it happily\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

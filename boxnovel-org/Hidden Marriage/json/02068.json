You\u2019ve had to put in so much effort for the company. Your brother will be able to share the burden with you after he grows up and takes over the company!</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore this, I was worried that you\u2019d be alone, but now, after your mother and I pass away, you siblings will be able to stay by each other\u2019s side. We\u2019ll be at ease!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Ha\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>Brother\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>Of course!</em></p><br/><p><em>The two of them must\u2019ve checked and confirmed that it was a boy, a successor the Ning family has been waiting for. If not, they wouldn\u2019t be this ecstatic!</em></p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was really outraged by Ning Yaohua\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Wait until her brother grows up and takes over the company!?</p><br/><p>She had spent so much effort to drive Ning Xi away and make herself the only daughter left, getting all the attention and care from them. Now that they had a biological son, did her place in the family still matter?</p><br/><p>They planned to discard her once they had a son. He actually sugar-coated it by saying that Ning Xueluo would have someone be by her side in the future, and even to share her burden.</p><br/><p>They just wanted to chase her away and never considered her at all.</p><br/><p>Her place in the Su family was already difficult, and now Zhuang Lingyu was pregnant with a boy. The future heir of the Ning family was forcing her onto the path of death!</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo sucked it up and forced a surprised smile. \u201cThat\u2019s great, really great. Congratulations, Father and Mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu held Ning Xueluo\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you, Xueluo. Don\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t neglect you because of your brother. You\u2019ll forever be my treasured daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo scoffed inside. However, she put on a happy act. \u201cOf course, I know, Mother! I\u2019ve always hoped to have a younger brother. He can help both of you out, and even support me in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua\u2019s uneasiness disappeared when he heard Ning Xueluo. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure! Who would your brother support if not you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu was worried that Ning Xueluo would be displeased, so she was relieved when she saw Ning Xueluo\u2019s attitude at the moment. In a gentle tone, she said, \u201cStay at home for a few days! I\u2019ll make some tonic for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo smiled brightly. \u201cYou too, Mother. You have to take care of Brother! My baby can become Brother\u2019s playmate too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua nodded happily when he saw the loving mother-daughter pair. \u201cXueluo, I\u2019ll be taking extra care of the company. Don\u2019t worry about it. Stay at home and rest with your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s back straightened up as her fingernails pressed deep into her palms.</p><br/><p>It had taken her so much effort to chase Ning Xi away, and she even got herself the shares from Ning Yaohua and Ning Yaobang, finally gaining control of the company.</p><br/><p>However, now he was trying to take back the power because of an unborn child? Trying to pave a path for him in the future already?</p><br/><p>What a kind father!</p></div>\n</div>"}

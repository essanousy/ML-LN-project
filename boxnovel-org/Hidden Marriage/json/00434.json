How low are their standards?\"</p><br/><p>\"You can\u2019t blame him, I can see that he looks quite old already and must have been working here for many years, yet he\u2019s still a lowly worker!\"</p><br/><p>\"He sure has bad eyesight. His way of handling things are so terrible. Why are you still keeping him here?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Listening to their conversation, the shop owner\u2019s chubby face turned red, and he tried his best to keep up a smile, \"Ah, pretty ladies, let\u2019s forget about them over there. They aren\u2019t affecting us anymore. Have a look around, don\u2019t let your mood get affected\u2026\"</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Ning Xi realized that this worker\u2019s attitude was professional, so she let go of the thought of going to another shop. She explained to him, \"Soon, it\u2019ll be my grandfather\u2019s 70th birthday, I\u2019m thinking of giving him a bracelet made of jade beads.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man confidently picked up a bracelet, \"Miss, what do you think about this? This bracelet is made up of 29 crystal clear round emerald jade. All of them are made from the same ore, the colors\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi ran her fingers over the beads and her eyes shone, \"I actually don\u2019t really understand what you\u2019ve just said, but I really like this one too. I\u2019ve been looking around since just now but none of them gave me the urge to buy it\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The man smiled, \"It means that you have an affinity with this bracelet, which is really rare. Please rest assured that the quality of this bracelet is guaranteed excellent!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi touched the bracelet, \"I really do like this one, but how much is it? My budget is around 150 thousand dollars. If it\u2019s higher than that, then I\u2019ll look at something else\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The man replied, \"What a coincidence! This bracelet costs exactly 150 thousand dollars.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly 150 thousand dollars?\" Ning Xi's heart leapt in joy.</p><br/><p>He nodded, \"Plus, we\u2019re doing a promotion, so there\u2019s another 20% discount.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was ecstatic as she was worried that all her money would go to the jade and she would have nothing left. Now, with the 20% discount, she would have a bit of money left.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded excitedly, \"Give me this one!\"</p><br/><p>Anxiety disappeared from the man's face, \"Alright, I\u2019ll pack it up for you right now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, thank you!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re welcome, it\u2019s my pleasure to serve you.\"</p><br/><p>He personally processed her payment, issued her receipt and packed the bracelet for her. Then, he handed it to her and bowed gracefully, \"Please come again!\"</p><br/><p>The owner of Jade Treasury stayed silent the whole time, his wide eyes staring unbelievably at the bracelet Ning Xi had just bought with less than 150 thousand dollars\u2026</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi had left, Su Yimo\u2019s bunch was still there.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ning Xi had gone, Liang Biqin was still unhappy and she lashed out on the middle-aged man, \"Hey, you! I\u2019m talking about you! What\u2019s wrong with you? Your boss already said that you guys are not selling these cheap jade ornaments anymore. What makes you think that you can make decisions on your own?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Who do they think they are, every single one of them!\u201d Ning Xi suddenly raised a fist agitatedly. If Lu Tingxiao had not reacted quickly, his jaw would have been dislocated by this punch.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirls shouldn\u2019t cuss.\u201d Lu Tingxiao knitted his brows.</p><br/><p>Although she looked cute when she was swearing.</p><br/><p>While Ning Xi was very drunk, her subconscious mind could feel that the person embracing her at the moment was very warm, and had no bad intentions. She slowly relaxed into his arms and slurred drunkenly as she sat in his lap, \u201cIt\u2019s only because I feel it\u2019s beneath me\u2026 Otherwise\u2026 Otherwise with this face\u2026 I could find a\u2026 a big leg to hug\u2026 You think you can suppress me\u2026 I\u2019ll go find one now\u2026 right now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised his eyebrow slightly. He picked up the woman\u2019s hand gently with his coarse palm and placed it on his thigh, \u201cThe biggest leg in the capital is right here, where else are you going to find a better one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi touched that toned thigh all over, then abruptly raged, \u201cIt\u2019s not big enough! It\u2019s not big at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been deemed \u2018not big enough\u2019.</p><br/><p>This was something no man could accept.</p><br/><p>What was worse, her hand moved about until it touched a place that should not be touched, and she even patted it, \u201cOoh, what\u2019s this\u2026 Annoying\u2026 it poked my hand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her tone was full of disdain.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression was dark.</p><br/><p>If he let her continue like this, then he was afraid he would do something he would regret.</p><br/><p>The person outside had already left, so Lu Tingxiao quickly opened the door, carrying Ning Xi as he walked out.</p><br/><p>At the underground carpark.</p><br/><p>The one who eagerly ran over to open the door for him was Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d Lu Tingxiao frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI went to look for you at home, but both you and Little Treasure weren\u2019t there so I came over to look for you! Bro, what happened to the bro code? When did you buy this car? It\u2019s even more impressive than the one you gave to me, and I didn\u2019t even know you had this!\u201d Lu Jingli\u2019s expression was full of resentment.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao ignored him and carried Ning Xi to the backseat without leave.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli sat in the front passenger seat and turned around to stare at them. His shining gaze took in Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi\u2019s disheveled clothing. Expecting some gossip, he asked, \u201cWhere did you pick her up from? Why did you take so long? See how our Little Treasure is about to turn into a statue!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he saw Ning Xi, Little Treasure stopped pressing his face against the car window and stuck to her instead.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had initially been worried that Ning Xi would have some sort of agitated reaction to Little Treasure\u2019s presence in her drunken state. He hadn\u2019t thought that she would only draw the little guy into her embrace and hug him comfortably like a bolster.</p><br/><p>Of course Lu Tingxiao would not satisfy a certain person\u2019s desire for gossip. He methodically removed his tie, and removed his sweaty coat, \u201cWhat happened today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Happy at being called to action for his information-gathering skills, Lu Jingli immediately replied excitedly, \u201cFrom what I heard, everything was going smoothly. You even called Arthur over, so of course little Xixi succeeded in stealing the show. She was received well by the media too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did she meet tonight?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked again.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli tried to recall, \u201cOther than the cast and crew, there was only Ning Yaohua. Other than that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli glanced at his brother\u2019s expression, then deliberately considered his words before speaking up, \u201cSu Yan\u2026 I\u2019m guessing that she was upset that her old flame became her rival\u2019s man, so she got drunk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Lu Jingli had already picked his words carefully, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face still turned black in an instant.</p><br/><p>It was so scary.</p><br/><p>TL Note: In Chinese, \u2018a big leg to hug\u2019 means a backer with a lot of influence. In Ning Xi\u2019s case, she was implying that she can find a sugar daddy at any time, but that she found it beneath her. Lu Tingxiao used the phrase \u2018big leg to hug\u2019 literally to make a joke\u2026 and got taken advantage of instead. \ud83d\ude1b</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She gave Ling Zhizhi a call to confirm that the programme would start the next day in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye wanted to join when he found out that Ning Xi was going to be on the show, but Lu Jingli stopped him with his authority as his boss.</p><br/><p>\"If I don't get to eat, neither do you!\" </p><br/><p>In the end, the male guest remain unchanged.</p><br/><p>It was a male celebrity who was not very famous. He was a little chubby and usually took on comedic roles.</p><br/><p>\"Beauty's Specialties\" was pretty popular when it had been newly released. Although many female celebrities made really disgusting food, that was exactly why it was popular. The scene where they showed the male guest eating the unidentifiable food was the highlight of the show.

Unfortunately, some viewers with sharp eyes realized it. There was an episode where the female guest's ring had disappeared when the screen changed to the cooking view!</p><br/><p>The viewers criticized the production team once again, and even the female guest was attacked harshly as well.</p><br/><p>In the end, the production team went back to their old ways of having pretty guests cooking bad food. While they might not be able to make the old viewers stay, they might be able to attract more new ones.</p><br/><p>Cooking shows always had lower ratings compared to other entertainment shows, but within its category, this show was the most popular one\u2026</p><br/><p>The next afternoon, Ning Xi brought Xiao Tao along and arrived at the studio on time.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wore Spirit Studio's latest dress with a floral design so she could move and cook more easily.

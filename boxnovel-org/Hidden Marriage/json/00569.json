He also felt a tinge of regret and envy. He had been trying so hard to get in contact with the Lu Corporation, yet his useless daughter was friends with Lu Jingli?</p><br/><p>Damn it, what a mistake! How could he forget?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was with Glory World Entertainment now, and rumor had it that that Ning Xi had been invited to join the company personally by Lu Jingli and that he really valued her.</p><br/><p>He had always thought that Ning Xi was just a small chess pawn and that the arrangement was nothing more than just a business strategy. Who would have guessed that they would be friends?</p><br/><p>\"Xueluo, has Ning Xi always been this close to the Lu family\u2019s Second Master?\" Ning Yaohua asked quietly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo clenched her fist tightly and stared at the direction Ning Xi left, only reacting after she heard Ning Yaohua\u2019s question. \"I\u2019m not so sure about this, Father, I guess you\u2019ve heard about the Second Master\u2019s personality as well. He\u2019s not as unapproachable as Lu Tingxiao and he\u2019s always friendly towards his colleagues. Ning Xi was recruited by him personally and she helped him win over Starlight Entertainment, so it\u2019s understandable that they are on friendly terms with each other!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua nodded. \"I see! If we could get in contact with Lu Jingli, it would be a lot more useful than just a small assistant like Cheng Feng\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s face froze and she felt embarrassed. \"It\u2019d be great if we could but, Father, you know that Sister has a great misunderstanding of us now, maybe...I could go and beg her?\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu could not keep quiet any longer. \"Why should you?! Lu Jingli has always been friendly with many people. How long will he remember her for? There are so many new artistes joining the company everyday, he will forget all about her soon! He was just here to pick her up on the way today!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an idea popped up in Ning Yaohua\u2019s mind. \"Xueluo, do you think that maybe Lu Jingli is interested in Ning Xi?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo knew what Ning Yaohua was thinking since she had thought about it too, but she instantly rejected the thought. \"Father, it doesn\u2019t seem very possible, almost everyone in the industry knows that Lu Jingli would never mess with his own artistes.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua sighed. He knew that from their earlier exchange too, but he thought it would do no harm to ask about it.</p><br/><p>It would be an immensely helpful resource even if they could just have the tiniest of ties to the Lu family, and it was the second-in-command of the Lu Corporation, Lu Jingli, who they were talking about\u2026</p><br/><p>Maybe, this useless daughter still had some value in her that they could exploit...</p><br/><p>As the three of them returned to the banquet hall, many people went up to them and asked if someone from the Lu family had come. They lied and said it was a relative of theirs and not anyone from the Lu Corporation.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put the sleepy little bun on her lap, feeling her heart ache to see the little bun\u2019s sleepy face. She tried to pat him to sleep while talking. \"I\u2019ve already said that I\u2019ll be late, why didn\u2019t you wait for me at home?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli stared at his brother and complained to Ning Xi, \"Well, I\u2019d have really loved to, but the both of them couldn\u2019t wait at all. They were fidgeting here the whole time because you were five minutes late past your promised two hours!</p><br/><p>\"His face was so terrifying when you didn\u2019t pick up his call just now! He couldn\u2019t wait anymore after you texted him that you\u2019ll be late and Little Treasure also started torturing me! So in the end, I had to drive them all the way here and wait for you!</p><br/><p>\"Finally, we arrived and then suddenly you were blocked, so I had to go down and get you into the car!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

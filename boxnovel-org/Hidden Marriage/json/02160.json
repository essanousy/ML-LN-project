For the third one, we\u2019ll be testing your physical abilities!\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao coughed lightly. \u201cThe content for the third level is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie then declared, \u201cDefeat me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli and Tang Lang were speechless after they heard Annie.</p><br/><p>This was not just difficult!</p><br/><p>It was impossible!</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, is this girl really that good?\u201d Qin Mufeng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot just good! She\u2019s a walking killing machine!\u201d Tang Lang gulped as he unconsciously felt pain in his chest area.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven all of you together can\u2019t defeat her?\u201d Qin Mufeng asked again.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang nodded. \u201cWe can\u2019t beat her even if everyone here attacked together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lu Jingli\u2019s eyes lit up as he thought of something. \u201cRight! We can look for help! Where\u2019s Master Han Xiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang scratched his head. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s gone to buy food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, looking for me?\u201d A long-haired man came in through the door with bags of food in his hand.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang quickly went over. \u201cYes! Great timing! These women are blocking the path! We have to pass three levels! We\u2019ve passed two and the last level is to defeat Annie! So, we can only rely on you now, Grandfather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao walked over to Annie and looked at Tang Lang like he was an idiot. \u201cWhy would I harm my girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, according to the rules, you should be on our side!\u201d Tang Lang was getting anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Han Xiao then continued, \u201cJust assume that I\u2019ve surrendered myself to the enemy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><br/><p>He surrendered so easily\u2026</p><br/><p>Their only hope was gone!</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Good job, Annie! The Master is with us now! You guys, prepare to die!\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao put her hands on her hips as if she had just achieved total victory.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d Lu Tingxiao took out his phone and made a call.</p><br/><p>Everyone was curious and looked at Lu Tingxiao\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs my uncle calling someone else for help?\u201d Jiang Muye had just finished changing out of his female outfit.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli scratched his head doubtfully. \u201cProbably?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang touched his chin. \u201cHow do I not know this? Does Boss have someone better than Annie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was getting even more curious now and all of them were focused on the door.</p><br/><p>After several minutes, there was the sound of footsteps near the door.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang straightened up. \u201cThese footsteps sound solid. It\u2019s definitely a practitioner! Hmm\u2026 but why does it feel like this person\u2019s center of gravity is a bit\u2026 low\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d asked Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means it\u2019s probably someone short!\u201d replied Tang Lang.</p><br/><p>As the two of them were discussing, Feng Xiaoxiao was on cautious mode. Could Lu Tingxiao really have someone strong she did not know about?</p><br/><p>Finally, the person opened the door and came in.</p><br/><p>The cute little bun appeared before everyone.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s eyes popped out when he saw it was Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God! Little Treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was stunned. \u201cDisciple! Why is it you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder his center of gravity was low!</p></div>\n</div>"}

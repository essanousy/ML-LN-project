But Lu Tingxiao did help me out a lot later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I get it. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re okay. I\u2019m hanging up! Remember to look at my email!\u201d Keeping in consideration that she was still sick, Jiang Muye restrained his temper. Since he didn\u2019t have the mood to ask about how Lu Tingxiao had saved the damsel in distress, he just hung up after speaking in a forceful tone.</p><br/><p>Damnit! If that Lu Tingxiao hadn\u2019t used some underhanded means to stall him, he would be by her side right now. He should be the one helping her through all those difficulties!</p><br/><p>Shameless, so shameless!</p><br/><p>\u201cWas that Jiang Muye?\u201d Lu Tingxiao casually asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was! He asked if I needed any help! He even said he sent me an email, I wonder what it is? He keeps reminding me to look at it, acting all mysterious. It\u2019s probably some birthday prank. He did the same last year, when he sent me a really scary prank video. I was so angry I had to beat him up three times before I finally vented all my anger\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi mumbled her complaints. She wasn\u2019t in any hurry to look at the email. She continued looking through her text messages and missed calls to see if there was anyone else she needed to reply.</p><br/><p>Most of the missed calls were from unfamiliar numbers, and were most probably from the media. When she reached the end of the call log, she saw a familiar name. The missed call had been made on her birthday.</p><br/><p>Looking at those two words, Ning Xi\u2019s indifferent expression turned warm, \u201cI thought he forgot my birthday!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Lu Tingxiao subconsciously turned tense.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy little brother, Tang Nuo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded and relaxed without any change in his expression.</p><br/><p>He thought it would be her ex. He was about to turn into someone who jumped at every new person appearing in her life.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately called him back, \u201cHello, Xiao Nuo~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJie, you finally called me back! How are you doing now? Are you okay? Did those people make trouble for you? I saw the news in the papers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I saw that that woman is trying to sue you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an easy target, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s going to be the one getting sued in the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really fine! If you continue worrying so much, I\u2019ll start suspecting that you\u2019re 70 instead of 17!\u201d Ning Xi paused for a moment, \u201cBut, you\u2019re believing me just like that? What if I really lost my mind and purposely stabbed Ning Xueluo to get her role?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young teen\u2019s voice sounded clear and bright even through the phone: \u201cWhy would I believe in others before believing my own dear sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Warmth spread in Ning Xi\u2019s heart upon hearing this, \u201cYou little brat! What a sweet talker!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop worrying now that I know you\u2019re fine. Oh yeah, I haven\u2019t wished you a happy birthday, and it\u2019s already passed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s the same even if you say it now. Thank you, my dear, handsome, sweet little brother~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop being so mushy! I\u2019m not going to talk to you anymore, school is about to start, I have to finish my summer homework!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go go! Work hard, young un!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the call, Ning Xi was in high spirits.</p><br/><p>Seeing how happy she was, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s mood lifted together with hers, \u201cYou have a good relationship with your brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Although we\u2019re not related by blood, we\u2019ve always gotten along very well together. I told you that my grandmother valued males more than females when I was young, right? Back then, if there was any good food around, only Xiao Nuo was allowed to eat it. I wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to eat at the table. However, Xiao Nuo would always hide some of it for me to eat. Whenever Grandmother found me an eyesore and tried to cause trouble for me, he would jump out to protect me. He\u2019s a really good kid!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, Ning Xi\u2019s spirits seemed to dampen, \u201cIsn\u2019t it strange? The ones I\u2019m actually related to treat me like a sworn enemy, but someone I\u2019m not related to at all treats me like family. I should have realised that benefits always outweigh kinship in those circles\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao gently patted the girl\u2019s lowered head, \u201cYou\u2019ll find better family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Each time he heard her speak of her childhood, he couldn\u2019t resist pampering her a little more, as if doing so would make up for everything she had missed out on.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

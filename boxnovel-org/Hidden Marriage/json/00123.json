I almost thought you fell into the toilet bowl!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething worse happened; I fell into a wolves\u2019 den!\u201d Ning Xi leaned back against the sofa, her face still containing traces of lingering fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jiang Muye\u2019s brows drew together.</p><br/><p>\u201cI walked into the wrong room. That room was full of the big shots of this city, and there was even this wretched fatty who forcefully held onto me and refused to let me go. He even made me accompany him in drinking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Jiang Muye\u2019s expression immediately changed. He looked her up and down with anxiety, \u201cThen how did you get back here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hummed, \u201cThat\u2019s because I had good luck; I ran into the boss of the big shots!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Jiang Muye\u2019s expression darkened, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me it was Lu Tingxiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi snapped her fingers, \u201cBingo! That\u2019s right! Big Boss Lu was too cool! He appeared right in the nick of time to save me from the fire and he even escorted me back to the right room himself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201c\u2026\u201d Wasn\u2019t Lu Tingxiao supposed to have high IQ and low EQ? Was this smooth man really the same Lu Tingxiao that he knew?</p><br/><p>After the dinner ended, everyone said their goodbyes one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, how are you going home? Do you want me to send you?\u201d Ye Linglong asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Ye-jie! There\u2019s no need, I have a friend nearby, my friend will send me home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, be careful on the road!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMuye, how about you? How are you leaving?\u201d Guo Qisheng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for my manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then see you all tomorrow. If the weather permits, we\u2019ll continue filming today\u2019s scene. Wasn\u2019t it strange that it rained and hailed today?\u201d Guo Qisheng mumbled gloomily.</p><br/><p>As the crew left one by one, only Ning Xi and Jiang Muye remained at the entrance.</p><br/><p>Bored and drunk, Ning Xi was close to her limits. She was leaning against the golden pillar at her back with half-lowered eyes, looking like a dead dog.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye cast a sideways glance at her, \u201cMing-ge will be arriving soon. Don\u2019t bother waiting for your friend, just go back with me! Wait a minute, don\u2019t tell me the one you\u2019re waiting for is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his words, a man dressed in a suit walked out from the hotel lobby. Under the moonlight, his steady footsteps carried him to Ning Xi, who was currently dozing off. His voice sounded like the breeze on a summer night, \u201cNing Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blurrily opened her eyes, \u201cLu Tingxiao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man before her had already become her safe harbour. The moment his figure appeared in her sights, she collapsed to the side as she let go of her last bit of consciousness\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation, Jiang Muye was shocked; before he could reach out to support her, someone else had already gotten there first. The girl collapsed safely into his arms.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao tidied the girl\u2019s messy hair with a warm gaze, before his other arm reached under her knees and he picked her up with ease.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a black Maybach had already stopped by the entrance silently; the driver speedily alighted and held the car door open.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Lu Tingxiao was treating him as if he didn\u2019t exist and was about to carry Ning Xi into the car, Jiang Muye finally couldn\u2019t hold back his impulse any longer. He quickly switched on the sound recording function on his phone before shouting from behind them, \u201cUncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s footsteps paused. He only turned the slightest back and questioned him with his gaze, as if he was asking whether something was the matter.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye gritted his teeth. Did he even have to ask what the problem was? Could he not show such a matter-of-fact expression?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat intentions do you have towards Ning Xi!\u201d Jiang Muye stared directly at him and spoke straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Lu Tingxiao lowered his gaze to look at the girl sleeping peacefully in his arms, \u201cTowards Ning Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Don\u2019t you think your attitude towards Ning Xi is strange? Isn\u2019t it too ambiguous?\u201d Jiang Muye resisted the strong pressure from the man and continued speaking. At the same time, he gripped the phone in his hands tightly, waiting anxiously for the man\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at the young man before him with an indifferent gaze, \u201cI believe I\u2019ve made my intentions clear enough. If you still don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next second, Jiang Muye\u2019s pupils abruptly contracted!</p><br/><p>The man in front of him didn\u2019t speak, but lowered his head and lightly touched the girl\u2019s lips with his own instead.</p><br/><p>After three seconds, the man withdrew with an expression of utmost yearning and affection. Before he left, his cold gaze shot towards the dumbstruck young man behind him, \u201cIs it clear now?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

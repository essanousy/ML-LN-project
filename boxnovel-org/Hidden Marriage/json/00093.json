After Jia Qingqing had caused such a ruckus, the director forced her to take two days off from filming to let her calm down.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had removed her makeup and was preparing to leave when Ning Xueluo quietly walked in. With her arms crossed over her chest and an expression full of contempt, she said, \u201cNing Xi, I really couldn\u2019t tell that you were so devious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? I\u2019m devious?\u201d With a faint smile, Ning Xi cast a glance at the bloody scratch on Ning Xueluo\u2019s arm, courtesy of Jia Qingqing. She then blinked with an innocent expression, \u201cWasn\u2019t it you who had such great vision, picking such a great teammate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ning Xueluo gritted her teeth. She was so angry that her chest hurt.</p><br/><p>How could she have known that Jia Qingqing would be so stupid? Ning Xi\u2019s reputation had already been marred to that point, yet she could somehow help her wash her reputation clean. The production crew were even changing their opinions of Ning Xi!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was sure to have something planned next. She had to quickly think of a way to respond to her actions, she absolutely could not let Ning Xi turn the tables around.</p><br/><p>After that short confrontation with Ning Xueluo, Ning Xi was walking out of the set when her phone rang- it was a text message.</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: I\u2019ll wait for you at the alleyway in front.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi prudently replied him: We\u2019ll each go our own ways. See you at home, I\u2019ll look for you at your house.</p><br/><p>An hour later, at Number 6 Platinum Palace.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had just walked to the door when Jiang Muye immediately tugged her in. He peeked out of his door and looked left and right, as if they were doing something shady.</p><br/><p>Previously, he hadn\u2019t minded if Ning Xi was connected to him in some way, and had even hated that he couldn\u2019t announce their special relationship to the world. However, after experiencing that incident, he couldn\u2019t help but reconsider what he had done previously.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put down her bag, kicked off her shoes and sat on the sofa cross-legged. The first thing she did was reach out her hand and ask: \u201cDid you film it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye looked at her speechlessly. She completely didn\u2019t care about her image in front of him. Did this damned woman even treat him as a man now? Why was she so casual in front of him? Her scoundrel-like appearance was exactly like how she was in the movie!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you treating me like a lousy teammate too? Of course I got it!\u201d Jiang Muye passed his phone over unhappily.</p><br/><p>When she had mentioned that she wanted to act like an innocent flower, he had already guessed what she wanted to do. Of course she was going to film all the exciting drama.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took the phone and pressed play. She nodded in satisfaction, \u201cYou did pretty well! I\u2019ll add a chicken leg for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, she opened her Weibo and tweeted with her main account. Of course, the contents weren\u2019t an apology like Chang Li wanted, but four words: The truth always prevails.</p><br/><p>After tweeting that out, she quickly logged into her side account and messaged a blogger specialising in Golden Age Entertainment gossip. She then sent the video containing Jia Qingqing\u2019s continuous failed scenes to him.</p><br/><p>Those two companies were really dead rivals. Not much time had passed since Ning Xi sent the message when the blog immediately posted the clip. They even added a very eye-catching caption: Failing a scene 33 times, the #1 useless flower vase in the entertainment circle shows you what shit acting is.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye cast a glance at her, \u201cYou\u2019re just sending it to this blog? You\u2019re not sending it to other blogs? I filmed that so painstakingly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had her head lowered and was buried in the comments section: \u201cThis is enough to draw attention. We don\u2019t need to do anything for the next step. Did you think that you were the only one filming just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you use that to deal with Jia Qingqing earlier? If you had done that earlier, she would have been swapped out immediately and there wouldn\u2019t be so much drama. You even made me endure that woman for two days!\u201d Jiang Muye muttered unhappily.</p><br/><p>No one had understood why Jia Qingqing kept forgetting her lines, only Jiang Muye knew what had happened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

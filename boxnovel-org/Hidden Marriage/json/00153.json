She then checked over and wiped down everything in that case carefully.</p><br/><p>After glancing at the time on her phone, Ning Xi stuffed the things into her bag and hurriedly went back downstairs.</p><br/><p>Not far away, Lu Jingli reported to Lu Tingxiao on his Bluetooth earpiece as he drove: \u201cNing Xi returned to her apartment and came back down in five minutes. We\u2019re currently on Xijiang Road, heading towards the outskirts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After half an hour had passed, Ning Xi finally stopped.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli looked at the dilapidated houses around him and his expression turned to surprise, \u201cEh? Isn\u2019t this where that prop director Zhang Qiang lives? What\u2019s Ning Xi doing coming here alone? Surely she\u2019s not going to talk some sense into him? Isn\u2019t that too naive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSwitch on the spy cameras.\u201d Over the Bluetooth earpiece, the man commanded in a cold and fierce tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh, right. I almost forgot I had those!\u201d Lu Jingli hurriedly grabbed his laptop from the back seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, give me a moment, I\u2019ll stream the video to you with my phone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli hadn\u2019t even finished speaking when he suddenly found that his laptop wasn\u2019t responding. His expression immediately darkened as he said rather speechlessly, \u201cBro, you actually hacked into my computer\u2026 I told you I\u2019d use my phone to stream the video to you! Could you stop being so hasty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Although Zhang Qiang drew a good salary from the production crew, because he liked gambling, on top of not having any extra cash, he still owed a bunch of debts. Thus, he lived in the slums of this district.</p><br/><p>This was what Ning Xi had heard about him while listening to him chatting with others while drinking with the production crew.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi knocked on the door three times.</p><br/><p>There was no movement from within.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued knocking until a bang sounded from within and the sound of slippers scraping against the floor could be heard. The rusty metal door was pushed open by someone from inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the **** is it! Are you courting death this early in the morning\u2026\u201d While in the middle of speaking, upon seeing that it was Ning Xi standing at his door, Zhang Qiang\u2019s expression abruptly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhang, I hope you\u2019ve been well since we last met.\u201d Ning Xi looked at him, seemingly all smiles.</p><br/><p>Zhang Qiang wanted to close the door on her, but after the cogs in his head turned, he changed his mind and said lazily, \u201cI wondered who it was! So it\u2019s the great beauty Ning! Come in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon entering the room, a strong odour consisting of the sharp scent of alcohol, smelly socks and mould battered her sense of smell. The killing power of this smell could be compared to the Surstr\u00f6mming from this morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cSit wherever you like.\u201d Zhang Qiang lit up a cigarette. His muddy eyes were glued to Ning Xi\u2019s body, impudently looking over every part of her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sat on the only chair that seemed clean in the room, then got right to the point, \u201cLet\u2019s not beat around the bush. I\u2019m sure Teacher Zhang knows why I\u2019ve come. I need your statement, and I need you to speak the truth. It was Ning Xueluo who did everything on her own, and I didn\u2019t bribe you to harm her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Qiang chuckled as he acted as if he had seen through her, \u201cLittle girl, you have a recorder on you, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re trying to draw out a confession from me? Hehe, you\u2019re too naive! I\u2019m sorry, whatever I told the reporters was the exact truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a shameless expression on as a radiant glint flashed across the depths of his eyes, \u201cUnless, you can pay the right price\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. She had expected that this would happen.</p><br/><p>This Zhang Qiang definitely wouldn\u2019t go too far after getting Ning Xueluo\u2019s money. He would continue betting and most likely end up losing all his money.</p><br/><p>He was even trying to take advantage of both sides now!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

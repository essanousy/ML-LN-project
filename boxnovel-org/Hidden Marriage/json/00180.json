Anyway, I glanced through most of it and I\u2019ve already signed it. I\u2019ll pass it back to you later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao frowned slightly, \u201cYou\u2019re so trusting towards me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged: \u201cI\u2019ll even help you count the spoils if you sell me off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled with a doting expression.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli: \u201c\u2026\u201d Ow, my single dog eyes! I\u2019m going blind from all these displays of affection! It\u2019s becoming impossible to live in this house.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf no surprises pop up, you can report at the company the day after. You rest at home for a day tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s great!\u201d Ning Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli wanted to smash his head against something after hearing that. The day after? Didn\u2019t that mean he only had one day to convince Lin Zhizhi?</p><br/><p>How heartless of his bro!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao seemed to have seen through Lu Jingli\u2019s inner complaints. He turned to his little brother and said: \u201cAfter you complete this task, you can go on holiday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwright! I\u2019ll go right now!\u201d Lu Jingli recovered all his spirit.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>That night, in a VIP ward in the First People\u2019s Hospital.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was staring dead-on at the woman on the TV screen.</p><br/><p>Outside Starlight\u2019s office building, despite disappearing for so many days, Ning Xi didn\u2019t look weak or haggard at all. Conversely, she looked radiant and practically glowed from the inside. Surrounded on all sides by five bodyguards in black, she faced the reporters\u2019 attacks with a domineering expression: \u201cFirstly, I\u2019m innocent, so I don\u2019t have to give myself up. There\u2019s also no reason for me to feel ashamed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecondly, the truth for Jia Qingqing\u2019s incident has already been made clear, please don\u2019t try to obscure the facts and mislead the public, otherwise that\u2019s slander!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirdly, I have terminated my contract with Starlight, just a few minutes ago. However, I was the one to initiate the termination and they weren\u2019t the ones to cancel my contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly, if they want to blacklist me, then I\u2019d like to see them try!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard Ning Xi\u2019s last words, Ning Xueluo abruptly threw the desk lamp by her side at the screen. After the impact, the screen fizzled and some smoke rose off the top of it, before it went completely dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cChang Li! What\u2019s the meaning of this? It was enough that Cui Caijing committed such a low-level mistake, but now even you\u2019re making mistakes? What did I tell you? You absolutely can\u2019t let her terminate her contract!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was the kind of person who would react to problems by scolding others. Chang Li was used to Ning Xueluo\u2019s personality, but even so, her expression turned a little ugly now, \u201cI\u2019ve already told you long ago. With Ning Xi\u2019s looks, if she managed to find a backer with power and money, I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her suppressed any longer! Since you forced her to that point, this kind of result is within our expectations\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are you telling me to just watch her change her fortunes just like that? I paid such a huge price! And even spent 8 million yuan for nothing!\u201d Ning Xueluo was in hysteria, unable to accept their plans failing for the umpteenth time.</p><br/><p>\u201cXueluo, it\u2019s not as bad as you think. Ning Xi\u2019s reputation has already been completely ruined in the entertainment circle. Even if she found a backer, she can\u2019t recover her reputation anymore. Besides, who would dare to use an artiste that our Starlight has blacklisted? Her career in this industry has come to an end!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only that, just think about it, she caused such a ruckus this time and simply tossed out 8 million yuan just like that. She was even picked up by bodyguards and a branded car; is there anyone in the world who wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that she\u2019s being kept? How would the Ning family even be able to accept her? Can she even enter high society like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening up to this point, Ning Xueluo\u2019s anger had finally subsided a little, \u201cHave you sent orders to the fan army?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! When this happened, I already sent orders down to them. Besides, even if we don\u2019t do anything, those reporters will surely frame things that way!\u201d Chang Li was absolutely confident.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

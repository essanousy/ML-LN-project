I had no idea you\u2019d have thought so much about it. I really didn\u2019t expect you to have something so huge on Han Zixuan and to even send it to me! Ah, why are you so silly, Youyou? Didn\u2019t you know that if this thing came out, you\u2019d be over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nonsense! Of course, she knew!</p><br/><p>She thought that Ning Xi would be over this time and that Xu Tao had promised her he would take her back into Glory World!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yin Youyou finally realized she had been following Xu Tao\u2019s plan. She had fallen into the trap of this cunning old fox.</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou was frustrated. \u201cXu Tao, if I\u2019m banned, you don\u2019t ever have to bother working in this industry anymore. If Glory World or Ning Xi knew you met with me, an artiste from Starlight, under those circumstances, and even tried to scout me over, what would they think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao shook his head with a painful expression. \u201cAh, I can\u2019t believe girls nowadays are so sly. Why are you like this? Oh right, I forgot to tell you that, the other day when I was talking with you, I recorded our conversation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao then took out his phone and played the audio file.</p><br/><p>The voices of their conversation started playing\u2026</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou listened from the beginning to the end as her face turned pale.</p><br/><p>That bastard Xu Tao, he did not leave a single hint or evidence at all. All along, he used a reminiscing tone as if he was worried about her.</p><br/><p>If this audio was leaked, not only it would not cause Xu Tao any harm, it would become the biggest evidence that she had sent Han Zixuan\u2019s video to Xu Tao.</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou sat back down on the chair behind her. \u201cXu Tao, you\u2019re taking revenge on me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao laughed. \u201cHaha, you\u2019re not that important for me to put in this much effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was just doing it for his queen.</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou started sobbing when she remembered how Xu Tao used to put in a lot of effort for her too.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro Tao, I\u2019m wrong\u2026 I know it\u2019s my fault\u2026 I was blinded and cheated\u2026 Starlight told me that they\u2019d let me and Han Zixuan be at the same position\u2026 Starlight would never let me get away this time\u2026 Please save me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao did not say anything. He took a final look at the girl whom he had brought into the path of stardom and then left.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a meeting room at Starlight Entertainment.</p><br/><p>Wang Haojun\u2019s expression was dark like thunderclouds as he slammed the table. \u201cYin Youyou, are you the one who sent Xu Tao those videos?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI gave it to them. What about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone thought Yin Youyou would deny it, but unexpectedly, Yin Youyou did not give any excuses and admitted to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWitch!\u201d Han Zixuan went up to her and slapped Yin Youyou\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou felt the stinging on her face, reminding her of all the times when she was bullied by Han Zixuan and the despair she experienced after she handed the videos over to Xu Tao.</p><br/><p>She had nothing left\u2026</p><br/><p>Absolutely nothing\u2026</p><br/><p>If Han Zixuan had not been such a bully, she would not have had to go this far!</p><br/><p>After several seconds of silence, Yin Youyou looked back up and raised her arm, returning a slap.</p></div>\n</div>"}

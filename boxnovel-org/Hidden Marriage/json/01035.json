She actually met a baddie on the way home! She was just out that night to buy some soy sauce and did not expect to meet Feng Jin's underling!</p><br/><p>And the only weapon she had on her right now was a bottle of soy sauce.</p><br/><p>The woman opened the car door. \"Please.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's brain worked fast as she sucked on her lollipop and tilted her head. \"Miss, who are you? I think you've got the wrong person! I'm not Bro Xi!\"</p><br/><p>The woman was a little taken aback. \"You're not Tang Xi?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued sucking her lollipop and shook her head innocently. \"Miss, my name is Little Bunny!\"</p><br/><p>The woman looked at her, then she glanced at Ning Xi's apartment and said coldly, \"I saw you coming out from 701.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head. \"I know the girl from 701. I always visit her but it's a girl, not a guy staying there!\"</p><br/><p>The woman was confused by Ning Xi's innocent expression.</p><br/><p>Although she knew that Tang Xi was actually a woman and she had seen her pictures in a female outfit before, this girl in front of her did not look like Ning Xi either.</p><br/><p>Could she have made a mistake?</p><br/><p>\"Oh my, it's really late already! I'm going home now! If not my mother's going to give me a good scolding! Goodbye!\" Ning Xi then walked away quickly.</p><br/><p>The woman who was left behind was perplexed.</p><br/><p>A voice came through the woman's Bluetooth earphone, \"Did you get her?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry, Elder Feng, I think I followed the wrong target!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wrong target?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I've sent a picture to your phone. Please check if the person is Tang Xi.\"</p><br/><p>Feng Jin then spoke to her through the Bluetooth earphone, \"The person in the picture...is Tang Xi.\"</p><br/><p>The woman was speechless. Had she been fooled by Tang Xi?</p><br/><p>Tang Xi was her idol! Not only did she find out that her idol was actually a man, she even turned out to be a stupid little bunny!</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry, Elder Feng! It's my mistake!\"</p><br/><p>Feng Jing coughed, \"It's alright...it's not your fault, continue your mission!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>The woman moved swiftly after she ended the call. She climbed over the walls and went towards Ning Xi's direction.</p><br/><p>A short while later, just when Ning Xi thought she had finally gotten away from that woman, a dark shadow appeared right in front of her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi almost cursed out loud when she saw her. She need not ask, her disguise was found out.</p><br/><p>The woman stood before Ning Xi with a cold expression. \"Bro Xi, your disguise was really amazing, I was almost fooled!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi kept quiet.</p><br/><p>That was not a disguise at all! That's who I really am! I've always been a cute little bunny, you stupid humans!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

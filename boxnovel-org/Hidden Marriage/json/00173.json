I saw someone at Xueluo\u2019s hospital today, was it you?]</p><br/><p>Su Yan: [You really went overboard with this matter. You can\u2019t keep using the guilt that we feel towards you to act without any restraint. Our tolerance is wearing thin!]</p><br/><p>Su Yan: [Escaping from your problems doesn\u2019t solve anything, you owe Xueluo an apology!]</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scoffed lightly before mashing out a reply: [I bought a watch last year!]</p><br/><p>At that moment, three knocks sounded from the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in~\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pushed the door open and walked in holding a mug of warm milk. Seeing that she was still sprawled out and using her laptop, he immediately frowned, \u201cWhy are you still surfing the web? You need to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was about to sleep, but I got disgusted with something right before bed.\u201d Ning Xi complained.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao walked over and passed the mug to her, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi received the mug of milk with thanks. Without any thought of hiding what had happened, she then moved the laptop over to show him the chat logs on screen.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression turned slightly darker after he glanced at the screen. He showed a doubtful expression, \u201cI bought a watch last year, what does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d After hearing Lu Tingxiao read out that phrase in such an upright manner, Ning Xi almost spat the milk out. She explained awkwardly while coughing, \u201cUh, it\u2019s some internet slang, it\u2019s a\u2026 it\u2019s a classic phrase used to openly scold someone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it? What does it mean?\u201d Lu Tingxiao modestly requested her explanation.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had no other choice but to start teaching him earnestly: \u201cThe abbreviation for \u2018I bought a watch last year\u2019 is \u2018WQNMLGB\u2019\u2026 Uh, do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded after understanding the meaning in just seconds.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi heaved a sigh of relief. Luckily the great demon king had a high IQ. Otherwise, she would really have been a little embarrassed if she had to say a curse like \u2018**** your mum\u2019 out loud.</p><br/><p>Over at Su Yan\u2019s side, upon seeing Ning Xi\u2019s reply, he immediately sent over another wave of messages, mostly along the lines of \u2018it\u2019s not too late to repent\u2019. Without even bothering with the messages, Ning Xi signed out of MSN and turned off her laptop.</p><br/><p>Seeing how Ning Xi had neatly ignored the messages, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s mood seemed to lift, \u201cI\u2019ve already contacted Ning Xueluo for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? What did you say?\u201d Ning Xi immediately asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pulled out his phone, opened an email and showed it to her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hurriedly moved closer to him to look at it. When she finished reading it, she turned completely speechless, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In Lu Tingxiao\u2019s email to Ning Xueluo, other than the evidence and an account number, there were only a few words and there wasn\u2019t even any punctuation: 8 million yuan in 24 hours.</p><br/><p>It was extremely like Lu Tingxiao\u2019s way of doing things.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad. The simpler it is, the easier it is to cause panic. This is pretty good.\u201d Ning Xi made a show of taking things seriously, nodding as she praised him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can terminate your contract with Starlight when the money comes in. I\u2019ll send a lawyer to accompany you there when the time comes, so they can\u2019t cause any trouble for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already gotten Jingli to prepare your contract with Golden Age and I\u2019ll show it to you tomorrow morning. If there\u2019s anything you want to change, we can discuss it later. After signing with Golden Age, the company will arrange for a press conference at an appropriate time and reveal the evidence. From there, we\u2019ll start on the legal proceedings\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s low voice resounded like a cello as he spoke calmly of the upcoming plans and arrangements.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was in a daze while listening to him. She could only nod and nod, before finally asking, \u201cIs there anything you need me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEat, sleep and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>TL\u2019s Note:</p><br/><p>\u2018I bought a watch last year\u2019 is Chinese Internet slang for\u2026 ahem, \u2018**** your mum\u2019.</p><br/><p>The original Chinese words for \u2018**** your mum\u2019 sound almost the same as \u2018I bought a watch last year\u2019 in Chinese, so \u2018I bought a watch last year\u2019 ended up becoming an alternate form for this curse. The pinyin is \u2018W\u01d2 q\u00f9 ni\u00e1n m\u01cei le g\u00e8 bi\u01ceo\u2019, so the abbreviation for this phrase is: WQNMLGB.</p><br/><p>Also, as a side note, 8 million yuan = USD ~1.16 million (as of today\u2019s rate).</p><br/>\n</div>"}

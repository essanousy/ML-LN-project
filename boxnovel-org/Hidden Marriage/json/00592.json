Grandfather, are you sure? Are you pulling my leg?\" Ning Xi probed, not believing what the elder just said.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao frowned incredulously as he listened to Ning Xi\u2019s conversation with her grandfather.</p><br/><p>He thought that the matter with Xi Shiqing had been settled last night. How in the world did this happen?</p><br/><p>The elder fumed, \"Why would I kid you at a time like this? That young man from the Xi family is already at the temple. He\u2019s going to shave his hair off this afternoon! Which part of this sounds like a joke?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was confused and she sputtered, \"This is...impossible! Could there be some other reason? Why would you think that it was because of me?\"</p><br/><p>\"What else could it be? He was acting all fine before he left, but he suddenly told his family he wanted to become a monk after having dinner with you! You are the biggest suspect!\" The elder continued, \"Xiao Xi, please think about what happened last night! Being a monk is not a trivial matter! If it\u2019s related to you, how can I face Elder Xi at this rate?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly felt guilty\u2026</p><br/><p>Actually, quite a lot happened last night\u2026</p><br/><p>Did she try too hard to get her message clearly across to him?</p><br/><p>Regardless, it would not have reached the point that he would decide to become a monk immediately!</p><br/><p>\"Grandfather, where are you now?\" She queried, hearing chanting in the background.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m at the Fahua Temple right now. Shiqing\u2019s grandfather and parents are here as well. Xiao Xi, please come over as I can\u2019t explain everything to you over the phone clearly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, I\u2019ll be right there!\"</p><br/><p>After she hung up, Ning Xi gave Lu Tingxiao an alarmed look. The devil\u2019s attack sure packed a great punch of destructive power!</p><br/><p>\"Xi Shiqing is going to become a monk?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded and stood up to leave. \"Yes, and it seems like it was because of me. I need to go to Fahua Temple at once.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll go with you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Forget it! What if he does something even more insane after he sees you?\" Ning Xi said bitterly.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll send you to the entrance of the temple.\"</p><br/><p>\"But you\u2019ll be late for work!\"</p><br/><p>\"Nothing much is happening in the morning. Just a meeting which I can get Jingli to attend on behalf of me instead.\" Lu Tingxiao was already calling Lu Jingli as he said this.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s cheerful voice answered the phone, \"Hello, Bro! What\u2019s up so early in the morning? Oh, did something happen? Heh heh.\"</p><br/><p>\"I can\u2019t attend the meeting later. Please attend it in my stead,\" Lu Tingxiao said calmly.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli's happiness was suddenly deflated. \"Ah? Can't you go? What happened last night? Did you and Xiao Xi Xi\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Xi Shiqing is going to become a monk now and I need to go to Fahua Temple with Ning Xi.\" Lu Tingxiao's reply stopped Lu Jingli\u2019s wild imagination in its tracks.</p><br/><p>\"What?!\" Lu Jingli gasped in shock, \"Become a monk? Are you kidding me?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli still could not believe what he had just heard. This latest development was a gossip's fantasy\u2026</p><br/><p>Most importantly, how could he be left out in such an important moment?</p><br/><p>He quickly gave his manager a call and have him hold the meeting instead, then he sped off to Fahua Temple.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

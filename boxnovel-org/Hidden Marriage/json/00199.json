But the question is will Ning Xi beat him up first? I know I keep mentioning Ning Xuelo getting slapped but I\u2019m reaaaaally looking forward to it. Like it can\u2019t come soon enough &gt;_&lt;</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was silently shocked for a moment, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were drunk that night, it was the night that the crew had the welcome dinner for me\u201d Jiang Muye reminded her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally remembered that night\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She had ended up in the wrong room that night and Zhu Xiangcheng had been harassing her.</p><br/><p>Later on Lu Ting Xiao had personally escorted her back to the crew room and told her to wait for him before she went home.</p><br/><p>And then later, she had seen Lu Ting Xiao drunk and had fallen unconscious. The things after that weren\u2019t too clear, after seeing Jiang Muye, he and Lu Ting\u2019s conversation should have occurred at that time\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Hearing Ning Xi\u2019s late response, Jiang Muye was even more frustrated and disheartened, \u201cYou still don\u2019t believe it? I know that you can\u2019t call these as conclusive evidence but the screenshots were him speaking with his parents, and even though the most important things are not recorded, this is not just some empty rumor\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a good long while, he heard a sigh over the phone,</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Muye, whether I believe it or not, this doesn\u2019t affect my decision to sign onto Golden Age. Even if he really does have feelings for me, he hasn\u2019t used his position in public or private to force me into anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi spoke this sentence, Jiang Muye knew he was finished.</p><br/><p>He did not imagine that Ning Xi would trust Lu Ting Xiao to this point when they\u2019d only known each other for a few months\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued, \u201cThank you, I know you are concerned about me. Tomorrow they are holding a press conference so now I need to concentrate on my preparation of this final battle. After this thing is over, we will revisit this matter, so don\u2019t dwell on it!\u201d</p><br/><p>If you wait for this thing to finish, by that time you will have fallen into his trap and wouldn\u2019t be able to escape!</p><br/><p>No, she was already caught in his trap\u2026\u2026.even knowing that, what could he do? Nothing. He couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>And\u2026\u2026\u2026. I wasn\u2019t just concerned about you\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>What right did he have to criticize Lu Ting Xiao, what he had been doing was not much better\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye had a deep sense of helplessness in his heart: \u201cYou sound busy, Talk to you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Ning Xi replied then hung up the phone. Suddenly, as if all her energy was drained, she fell back on the bed, eyes staring blankly at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Until now, she hadn\u2019t been able to get Muye\u2019s phrase \u201che kissed you in front of my face\u201d out of her head.</p><br/><p>Probably because of an actor's imagination and the brain's ability to fill in details, she could almost completely picture the scene at that time. Her heart began beating faster\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pulled out her cell phone and quickly sent Lu Ting Xiao a message through WeChat trying to pretend as if nothing was wrong:</p><br/><p>NX: [Boss, I want to look through the manuscript for the conference. This evening, you don\u2019t need to call me to eat, I\u2019ll just grab some fruit. I ate way too much meat last night and need to lose weight ^_^]</p><br/><p>How could she look at him? She was obviously good at disguising her feelings, but in front of Lu Ting Xiao she had no confidence.</p><br/><p>Downstairs in the living room, Lu Ting Xiao opened the WeChat Ning Xi just sent him, then glanced in the direction of her room.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli quickly peeped at the phone, his face becoming disappointed, \u201cIsn\u2019t sister-in-law cooking tonight? I was looking forward to it\u2026\u2026so sad\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished with the phone, Lu Jingli turned and grabbed his brother's shoulder earnestly, \u201cJiang Muye, that kid seems desperate, right? The next material seems like it\u2019s a bit ruthless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chapter 199 \u2013 Not Just Concerned About You Teaser</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was silently shocked for a moment, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were drunk that night, it was the night that the crew had the welcome dinner for me\u201d Jiang Muye reminded her</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally remember that night\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She had ended up in the wrong room that night and Zhu Xiangcheng was harassing her.</p><br/><p>Later on Lu Ting Xiao had personally escorted her back to the crew room and told her to wait for him before she went home.</p><br/><p>What she didn\u2019t know is that Blazaria\u2019s team of editors and translator were setting up the perfect scene for her to get married.</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Muye caught them in the act and threatened to video tape them and show it to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>The translator and editors retreat for now</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then, with the shuffle of footsteps, she saw the return of her son who had been away for several days on a business trip.</p><br/><p>When she saw her son, Zheng Minjun instantly smiled. \u201cSu Yan you\u2019re back! Why are you so late? Shouldn\u2019t you have been home by yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan did not answer. \u201cWhere\u2019s Father and Xueluo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s in the study room upstairs. Xueluo seems to have some social event tonight. She\u2019s not back yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Su Yan nodded slightly, then he walked upstairs. \u201cI\u2019ll go look for Dad. I have something to discuss with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun had been going around to get information about Ning Xi and the Zhuang family for the past few days. After waiting for Su Yan\u2019s return for so many days, she wanted to first ask about her son\u2019s opinions, but based on Su Yan\u2019s hurried manner, he seemed to have an emergency, so she could only temporarily set it aside. \u201cOh, okay\u2026 quickly go then!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the study room.</p><br/><p>Under the table lamp, Su Hongguang was solemnly looking at a land tendering file. This land was extremely important to their corporation, but if there were no inside connections at the top level, it was almost impossible for them to fight with the other two companies.</p><br/><p>Sometimes lacking in that bit of connection would make it extremely difficult to achieve most things in their industry.</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang\u2019s eyes turned dark. He could not help but think about his wife\u2019s words from the other day\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Yan and Xueluo had been married for so long after all. The Su family and the Ning family were now inseparable, and a divorce would cause a butterfly effect, which was why he had told Zheng Minjun not to be impulsive.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, if Su Yan could have married Ning Xi, the huge amounts of benefit that she could bring, as steady as he was, would be enough to waver things.</p><br/><p>If he could really get connected to the Zhuang family through marriage, then all the trouble brought by a divorce would just be a minor issue\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang was deep in his thoughts when suddenly the familiar sound of his son\u2019s voice broke his reverie.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was then that Su Hongguang returned to his senses. He looked up towards his son and said, \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan nodded, his expression a little unusual. \u201cFather, there\u2019s something I want to discuss with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw Su Yan behaving so oddly, Su Hongguang sat upright. \u201cSit down then. It\u2019s quite late. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan did not sit down. Instead, he remained standing with a straight back before the study desk. As if he had just determined something, he then said to Su Hongguang with a confident gaze, word for word, \u201cFather, I\u2019m planning to divorce Xueluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant he said that, Su Hongguang\u2019s expression shifted to become startled. At the same time, darkness flashed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang suppressed all sorts of disorderly thoughts in his mind before he said with an extremely solemn expression as he looked at son, \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, I know that you and Mother will definitely oppose this, and you definitely won\u2019t understand my impulsive and unreasonable actions, but\u2026 about this\u2026 I\u2019m definitely not acting rashly. I\u2019ve gone through careful deliberation. I\u2019ve thought about it for a whole year! I\u2019ve already made my decision!\u201d Su Yan\u2019s tone was unyielding.</p><br/><p>Instead of saying that he was there to discuss it with him, he should have just said that he was there to inform him.</p><br/><p>If it had been before he found out about Ning Xi\u2019s identity, Su Hongguang would definitely be extremely angry to hear Su Yan calling for a divorce.</p><br/><p>Yet\u2026</p><br/><p>Everything was a little different now\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They started to analyze matters one by one.</p><br/><p>It was better if they did not analyze things, because in the end, after deeper thought, it became frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloody hell! I really thought Ning Xueluo was innocent. Now that I think more about it, this girl was a manipulative prostitute! What encouraging goddess? Everything that she has today was clearly all stolen from Ning Xi! Without the Ning family, would she have been able to make it in the entertainment industry? If she didn\u2019t hook up with Su Yan, which rich and powerful family would take in a wild fowl?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Zixuan, Ning Xueluo\u2026 No wonder these two people have such a close relationship! Indeed, birds of a feather flock together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi was really f*cked up! Since she was a baby, she was carried home wrongly. She\u2019s a proper heiress who became stranded among commoners, forcing her to have a home she couldn\u2019t return to. And just when she finally thought she found true love, she was betrayed. Someone who was supposed to be the person she loved most hurt her completely!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, Ning Xi had never once used her background or personal matters to gain pity. Instead, she relied on her own capabilities without a word and climbed to what she is today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead, it was certain people, who weren\u2019t satisfied with stealing people\u2019s parents and boyfriend. She even wanted to force people to their doom! She\u2019s already pregnant. Doesn\u2019t she know to cultivate some good karma for the child in her womb?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ning Xueluo stared at the live stream on her laptop, her initially pure little face twisted into a wicked expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi, I regret it and I finally understood who I really like, no, really love is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi, I\u2019ve already lied to myself for too long. I don\u2019t want to continue deceiving others and myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a title, I\u2019ll marry you. I\u2019ll handle everything! You\u2019ll still be Mrs. Su. We can start everything all over again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s every word and sentence, all the comments from the media and the spectators made Ning Xueluo tremble violently. Her sharp nails stabbed into her palms until fresh red blood started to drip onto the ground.</p><br/><p>What did they mean by a mistress climbing to the top!?</p><br/><p>Su Yan liked her. He loved her!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was the third party that had wrecked their marriage! Ning Xi was the shameless slut that stole her man!</p><br/><p>Now, the entire world knew that Ning Xueluo\u2019s man had pestered Ning Xi, and even wanted to divorce her for Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Such humiliation was about to drive her crazy!</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Ning Xi!</em></p><br/><p><em>How dare you!?</em></p><br/><p><em>I want you dead!</em></p><br/><p><em>I want you to die horribly!</em></p><br/><p>In the charity dinner hall, the reporters had surrounded Ning Xi once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning Xi, how did Ning Xueluo get in between you and Su Yan back then? What was the actual situation? Could you tell us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, from the conversation, we can tell that Su Yan has already regretted it, and even wanted to get a divorce for you. Would you get back together with Su Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, Starlight has been trying to poach you. Would you choose to leave? After all, putting aside all of the personal elements, given their capabilities, wouldn\u2019t Starlight be better for your career?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Regarding the personal matters, Ning Xi did not answer. Her gaze skimmed everyone present, and then she said, \u201cSince all the friends of the media and my fellow artistes of the industry are here, I\u2019d like for everyone to be my witness.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard Ning Xi, all the media and artistes instantly held their breaths and waited for Ning Xi\u2019s next words.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi paused, then she looked towards the camera and continued, \u201cI, Ning Xi, today swear that in living, I am Glory World\u2019s artiste. In death, I am also Glory World\u2019s ghost. As long as I\u2019m still in the entertainment industry, I definitely won\u2019t leave Glory World. I will be with Glory World through thick and thin.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

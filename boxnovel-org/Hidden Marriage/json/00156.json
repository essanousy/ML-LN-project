My great ancestor, please spare me! In the past, I wasn\u2019t enlightened so I spoke some nonsense. How could I even dare to ask for your money?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that I\u2019d give you money?\u201d Ning Xi threw a kick.</p><br/><p>After rolling over and standing up, Zhang Jiang wore an innocent expression, \u201cBut didn\u2019t you just say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was about to go crazy from all the abuse he was getting from this person\u2019s mood swings.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi cast him a cold glance, \u201cStay at home and wait for me to contact you. As long as you cooperate with me, there\u2019ll be money in it for you. Otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah? She still wanted to contact him? Hadn\u2019t he already give her everything she wanted? Weren\u2019t they agreed on never crossing paths again? Why was she still hounding him?! He didn\u2019t want any money! He preferred to stay alive!</p><br/><p>Zhang Jiang had a lot of unspoken complaints, but all he could do was agree to her demands and thank Ning Xi a thousand times for her kindness and grace as he sent her out.</p><br/><p>After going downstairs, Ning Xi put on her helmet and started up the engine before speeding straight towards the Lu residence.</p><br/><p>When she arrived at the Lu residence, she was actually an hour earlier than the time she had agreed on with Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>When she entered the living room, Lu Tingxiao was just as she had left him. He was still sitting on the living room couch, looking as if he hadn\u2019t even budged at all.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t think much of it. She asked immediately, \u201cLu Tingxiao, I\u2019m back! Did Darling Little Treasure wake up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m going up to check on him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Lu Tingxiao suddenly called out to stop her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, what\u2019s up?\u201d For some reason, Ning Xi felt like Lu Tingxiao\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s tone was calm and even, yet it felt like there was something dark hidden beneath the surface.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi instinctively sensed the danger and responded hastily, \u201cI went out to handle some personal matters, that\u2019s all. Everything\u2019s already been settled! I\u2019ll be going upstairs now!\u201d</p><br/><p>She tried to slip away right after she finished speaking, but an arm suddenly reached over. A second later, caught off guard, Ning Xi\u2019s body was pulled with some force and she fell onto the couch.</p><br/><p>More accurately, she fell into Lu Tingxiao\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was shocked. What surprised her even more was, \u201cLu Tingxiao! Y-You\u2026 What are you doing? Where are your hands going?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao completely ignored her and continued to touch her all over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m going to fight back if you continue like this! You can\u2019t blame me if I hurt you then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s nerves were practically about to collapse, \u201cF***! Lu Tingxiao! What are you trying to do? You\u2019ve already figured out that I can\u2019t make a move against you, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxaio stared at her expressionlessly, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you make a move against me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 Because\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! Why? If it was anyone else, her first reaction would have been to dole out a generous beating\u2026</p><br/><p>While Ning Xi was racking her brains to come up with a reply to that question, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s hands landed dangerously upon an object behind the waistline of her pants.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes immediately flashed. She wanted to stop him, but it was already too late. The gun that was hidden behind her waist appeared in Lu Tingxiao\u2019s hands in an instant.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao immediately threw the gun onto the coffee table in front of them. The usual exceedingly gentle expression he used towards her had turned as cold as frost. He spit out a word like he was shooting a blade of ice, \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately felt like she had been caught red handed cheating on a test by the teacher. Her face paled and she fiddled with her fingers. With great effort, she put on a carefree expression and spoke, \u201cHehe, it\u2019s just a fake! It\u2019s a toy gun that I bought to play around with!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Does a toy gun need a silencer?\u201d Lu Tingxiao cast her a sideways glance and picked up the gun. He pointed it directly at a palm-sized, white jade flower vase sitting in the corner and opened fire.</p><br/><p>The flower vase immediately shattered into tiny pieces.</p><br/><p>The calm expression that Ning Xi had been using all her strength to keep on her face also shattered\u2026 just like the flower vase\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

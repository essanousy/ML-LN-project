We can\u2019t disclose private information regarding people\u2019s households!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Li quietly handed her a shopping card, \u201cSister, just do me a favor! I just want to know if she lives here. This is not sensitive information I\u2019m asking for, it won\u2019t affect you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Fang looked disdainfully at the shopping card. In her heart she was thinking, you have always been speaking to me in an arrogant tone, but now that you have a favour to ask, you know how to ask nicely?</p><br/><p>She initially wanted to return the card, but then she changed her mind and accepted the card, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re right, she lives here. Two weeks before, we received information about her registration.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wanted to push back, but she changed her mind and accepted the card, saying, \u201cYes, she is living here. We received information about her registration about two weeks ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Chang Li listens, her eyes immediately light up. \u201cWho is the head of the household?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Fang looking at her face knew exactly what she was thinking and said the truth, \u201cIt is registered under the Golden Age Entertainment, it must be the arrangement of the company for her to stay here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Li was dumbfounded, \u201cWhat? Are you sure you haven\u2019t made a mistake?\u201d She had thought she could catch Ning Xi making a mistake\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Fang replied in a relaxed tone, \u201cHow could I make a mistake? That apartment is Imperial Pearl River\u2019s best apartment, it faces the Pearl River, and has a great view. It has always been empty until two weeks ago, when Golden Age workers came to renovate the place. The property information table is filled with her information!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, thank you\u2026\u2026\u201d Chang Li replied blankly as she hurried out.</p><br/><p>Damn, is Golden Age crazy? To actually give Ning Xi, a new starlet, such good treatment.</p><br/><p>She then thought of her recent conversation with Ning Xi, when she said how good the apartment Starlight arranged for her was\u2026\u2026 She was simply slapping her own face\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Seems like it is necessary to a keep a close eye on Ning Xi. She must find out, who is the person behind this slut!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>With the help of Lu Ting Xiao, Ning Xi finished tidying up what should have taken the whole day in half a day.</p><br/><p>Looking at her things that had been placed in good order, her mood became better.</p><br/><p>After she joined Golden Age, it had always felt unreal. But at this moment, looking at her future nest, she finally gains a sense of realism.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a new towel and handed it to Lu Ting Xiao. \u201cThanks for your help today. I\u2019ll invite you to dinner, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter what, Lu Ting Xiao had a busy day helping her move, the least she could do was cook a meal for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we dine here?\u201d asked Lu Ting Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head, \u201cAh? I have yet to try the kitchen\u2019s stove. And I don\u2019t have any ingredient, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m unable to cook anything\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, you don\u2019t have to do it. You are already very tired today.\u201d After speaking, Lu Ting Xiao made a call. He said two words to the people on the other end of the call: \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next second, the doorbell rang.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suspiciously opened the door, and instantly jumped back in fright.</p><br/><p>Outside the door, were people, all lined up in two rows, all dressed in uniform, holding trays filled with a variety of food.</p><br/><p>Standing right at the front was a young man, holding a large bouquet of fresh lilies.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao with a straight, upright posture, walked at a strong and powerful pace towards her, took the flowers from the young man, then turned and presented it to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

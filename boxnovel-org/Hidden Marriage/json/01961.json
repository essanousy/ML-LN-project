The master is injured?\u201d Ning XI could not believe it.</p><br/><p>Even if people around her did not know about his abilities, she understood them very well.</p><br/><p>The maniac who could not even be harmed by bullets was now unconscious on a white tiger\u2019s back?!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet him in now!\u201d Ning Xi was worried.</p><br/><p>No matter what Han Xiao thought of her, he was not just her buddy. He was her life savior.</p><br/><p>If it was not for Han Xiao, Little Treasure and she could have been dead already.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No way!\u201d Lu Jingli stopped Ning Xi in shock. \u201cSister-in-law, how are you getting him inside? He\u2019s on the tiger\u2019s back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was on the tiger\u2019s back, so what could she do?</p><br/><p>Tell the white tiger to be good and let him down?</p><br/><p>Let the white tiger come in and feed it?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mind went blank after Lu Jingli reminded her of her dilemma. She was wondering how Han Xiao had suffered those injuries, and how he got on a white tiger\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Open the door,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, are you sure?\u201d Lu Jingli felt like Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao were going crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis white tiger won\u2019t hurt us,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Before Ning Xi could say anything, an atrocious phenomenon happened. The white tiger let Han Xiao down before the window, then it retreated by about 10 meters.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was bewildered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis white tiger has such high intelligence?\u201d Lu Jingli could not comprehend it. \u201cIt\u2019s much more intelligent than a dog\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it odd that a tiger is more intelligent than a dog?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026I\u2019ve never been in contact with a tiger, only dogs,\u201d replied Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao ignored Lu Jingli. Without any hesitation, he went out and brought Han Xiao in. The white tiger watched them from afar. It left after they took Han Xiao inside the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call a doctor over. If things get worse, we\u2019ll send him to the hospital,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ning Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao quickly made a phone call and had a doctor to go over while Lu Jingli was looking at Han Xiao curiously.</p><br/><p><em>This was the maniac\u2026 No, the master that Ning Xi had mentioned\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>Impressive! He had ridden on the back of a white tiger. However, who could have injured someone like him?</em></p><br/><p><em>Ning Xi had said before that even guns could not do anything to him. No matter what, it still felt unbelievable to Lu Jingli.</em></p><br/><p><em>There should not be anyone who was not afraid of guns.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-law, why was this master on the white tiger just now?\u201d Lu Jingli peered at Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a fresh sight for me!\u201d Lu Jingli seemed impressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the unconscious Han Xiao spoke. His eyebrows knitted together with his eyes still closed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you\u2019re awake! Are you alright?\u201d Ning Xi quickly went over when she heard Han Xiao speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is there not to be alright about? I\u2019m alright as long as I\u2019m not dead\u2026\u201d Han Xiao still did not open his eyes, but his speech seemed normal enough.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

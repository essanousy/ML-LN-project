Those Chinese characters? Did that designer say that\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Those are Chinese characters and that\u2019s really that designer\u2019s name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod! That\u2019s impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Within the industry, many people knew that designers liked to leave some unique markings on their favorite work. It might be a symbol or their initials.</p><br/><p>However, no one ever heard of a designer leaving the name of someone else on their work.</p><br/><p>David was staring at the big screen as if he had just seen ghosts come alive. His forehead was filled with sweat and his heart was racing quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, what\u2019s happening? Why is Gong Shangze\u2019s name on David\u2019s work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid someone play some trick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGong Shangze asked David just now if he embroidered the clothing himself. David replied \u2018yes\u2019 confidently!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my gosh! What a twist\u2026 Could David have really stolen the \u2018Rainbow Feathers\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, all other designs from David are suspicious too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>David\u2019s limbs went numb as he listened to the discussions around him. He unconsciously looked towards a certain direction.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression seemed terrible.</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>How could it be!?</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze was just an idiot who was not aware of him at all. How could he have thought of embroidering his name on the clothing back then!?</p><br/><p>How could he not have noticed it after he checked them over and over again!?</p><br/><p>That brat had laid a trap for him just now and made him say that he embroidered all these clothes himself.</p><br/><p>He could not change it now!</p><br/><p>David\u2019s brain was going to explode.</p><br/><p>The president of Lorraine Fashion Society, Akas, went up on-stage to take a look for himself.</p><br/><p>After careful inspection, all six clothing had Gong Shangze\u2019s name at a hardly noticeable spot on the inside of the sleeves.</p><br/><p>The crowd went wild!</p><br/><p>Everyone who was watching the live stream was shocked too.</p><br/><p>What was happening?</p><br/><p>Why was Gong Shangze\u2019s name on \u201cRainbow Feathers\u201d?</p><br/><p>On the stage, after checking all the clothing, his eyes fell on David. \u201cDirector David, can you provide us with an explanation?\u201d</p><br/><p>David came back to his senses. He tried to act calm and put on a surprised expression. Angrily, he said, \u201cHow could it be!? That\u2019s impossible! Why would I embroider the name of another designer on my work? I didn\u2019t do that!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

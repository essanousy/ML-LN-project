The next day, Ning Xi planned on taking Little Treasure out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Xi, do you not want to wait for young master to come home from work and go out with you?\u201d The old housekeeper asked. He finally couldn\u2019t stand it, and tentatively became a matchmaker.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head, \u201cForget it, he is very busy! We\u2019ll just go by ourselves.</p><br/><p>Now is not the time for her to go looking for Lu Ting Xiao, how can she also wait for him to come back from work \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, let the bodyguards follow you. On young masters account , the little master\u2019s security cannot be sloppy.\u201d The old housekeeper said, pointing to three bodyguards in black sunglasses.</p><br/><p>This is a reasonable request.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi can only agree.</p><br/><p>So now she doesn\u2019t need to find Jiang Muye to be the driver\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Why does she feel that Lu Ting Xiao set this up deliberately?</p><br/><p>Today, Ning Xi planned on going out with Little Treasure to buy him toys and clothes. Of course, because she hadn\u2019t started working, she hadn\u2019t been paid yet. There was no choice but to bring Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s card.</p><br/><p>When shopping, she accidentally discovered a newly opened store that had very cute children\u2019s clothes. She quickly went into her buying everything mode.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling darling, this set also looks good. Try it on quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure nodded, and obediently went into the dressing room.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi is outside the dressing room, passing the little bun clothes when suddenly, she sees two familiar figures entering the shop.</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo is holding Su Yan\u2019s hand, and the two are speaking to each other.</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo: \u201cNext month is Fang Lin\u2019s son\u2019s birthday, right? We should buy some clothes as gifts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u201d Su Yan replied, his expression saying he had no idea who Fang Lin\u2019s son was</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Lin\u2019s son, you don\u2019t remember him? He\u2019s white and fat and is really cute.</p><br/><p>Yan brother, if we had a son, would he also be cute?\u201d Ning Xuelo asked him shyly</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably\u201d Su Yan replied perfunctorily, signaling his disinterest.</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo\u2019s face fell, \u201cYan brother, are you still mad at me? I\u2019ve made a public apology on the microblog, and you personally heard Cui Caijing explain it. As for the phone call, I did it because you suddenly ignored me. I drank a little wine, my heart was really anxious so I said a lot words I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u2026I regret it till I could die\u2026\u2026\u201d (please die then)</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo is explaining, then out of Su Yan\u2019s mouth comes Ning Xi\u2019s name. Following his line of sight, she saw that Ning Xi stood by a row of hangers across from them.</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo: \u201cMy sister\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo\u2019s eyes immediately became wet and immediately rushed towards Ning Xi taking her hand, \u201cMy sister, I finally got to see you! I\u2019ve been trying to apologize to you, but these days you have been ignoring me and don\u2019t take my phone calls. I don\u2019t know where you live\u2026\u2026when you asked me before, I said I didn\u2019t believe you but I know that it\u2019s a misunderstanding. There\u2019s no way you could do that kind of thing! Now that the truth is out, although there is damage to you, I am also a victim. Really, because of me, you got hurt and I\u2019m sorry! Really sorry! You can scold me or hit me as long as you forgive me!\u201d(Mortal Kombat voice: Finish her!)</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo\u2019s words can be described as smooth and sincere, making it sound like</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was an unreasonable bully to her.</p><br/><p>In the past, Ning Xi was not as sharp in verbal wars. She glanced at Su Yan, directing a tired and helpless glance his way.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

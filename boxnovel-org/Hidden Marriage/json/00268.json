Good!\" Guo Qisheng came to his senses and called the scene to a stop.</p><br/><p>\"Not bad, Ning Xi, the way you dealt with this by hiding half of your face actually resulted in a better effect!\" Guo Qisheng complimented, while the other crew members also nodded their heads in agreement.</p><br/><p>\"Director, as long as you\u2019re satisfied, all\u2019s good,\" said Ning Xi, forcing herself to smile. Dang you! I was just acting out a romantic kiss scene, not a crime scene, yet I had to act till I was physically and mentally exhausted!</p><br/><p>Her eyes then involuntarily shifted to a certain direction\u2026</p><br/><p>Opposite her, the producer was saying something to Lu Tingxiao while he sat there quietly, like a dull oil painting that had been sitting in a dark corner of an old castle for many years, cold and lonely. Somewhere within his eyes, there was a heart-wrenching sort of loneliness\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was taken aback by that sight, hurriedly turning around to leave.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Xi, where are you going?\"</p><br/><p>\"The toilet!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly sent a text message to Lu Jingli as she walked down the corridor \u2014</p><br/><p>[Senior Vice President, what is your brother trying to do???]</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli replied her swiftly, \"How would I know? He was already acting weird yesterday when he saw the TV play your interview and behind-the-scenes footages. Then, this morning he saw the tabloid news about the both of you playing video games all night, so he immediately postponed a meeting and came here to inspect!\"</p><br/><p>[Did he let you know what he\u2019s thinking about doing, or if he has any plans?] Ning Xi quickly asked, since she knew that the best strategy to win was to know her enemy!</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know how my brother is like - he would never tell me this kinda things!]</p><br/><p>[Then...then was there anything that was odd about him? Try to recall anything!]</p><br/><p>[Odd...yes, I think there was one incident! Yesterday, after he finished watching TV, he suddenly glared at a plate of carrots coldly, and then told the butler to never serve this dish! Isn\u2019t that weird? As smart as I am, I can\u2019t seem to understand what this odd behaviour means!]</p><br/><p>[...] Ning Xi\u2019s head immediately flashed across the words \"harvest the carrot\". It looks like Lu Tingxiao had entirely misunderstood her and Jiang Muye!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought for a while, and typed again, [How\u2019s your brother now? He should be okay, right?]</p><br/><p>She had already used up all her brain juices to come with the idea of kissing through a mask...</p><br/><p>[No way. The moment you kissed him, the air turned so chilly that I felt like I was ten million meters underground in some thousand year old ice cave.]</p><br/><p>[Uhh\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Oh, right, little Xi Xi, where are you? Be careful! My brother\u2019s currently not in sight, and I don\u2019t know where he went. My guess is that he\u2019s probably gone to look for you, be careful okay!]</p><br/><p>As soon as Ning Xi finished reading that last sentence from Lu Jingli, a silhouette fell from behind her, and someone was forcefully pulling her away.</p><br/><p>She felt a hand grabbing her waist and when the world seemed to be spinning around her, she was pushed into the toilet, and she heard the sound of a door closing. Then, she felt her back pressed up roughly against the door and before she could call out in pain, her voice was muffled by a hot, crazy, and hungry mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, because Ning Xi could barely breathe, the only thought that crossed her mind was \u2014</p><br/><p>\"Dang you, Lu Jingli! You did this on purpose, didn\u2019t you!\"</p><br/><p>She refused to say out loud, \"You could have warned me earlier!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Don\u2019t simply say things!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed lightly without minding at all. \u201cMomo is great and she\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s very popular in the office.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAww, really?\u201d Mother Han was being humble, but just from her tone, you could tell that she was delighted.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Mother Han chatted for quite a while before she hung up. She even made Mother Han forget the thought about urging her to get a boyfriend. Han Momo shed tears of gratitude, wishing she could devote her life to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro Xi, thank God you\u2019re not a man. Otherwise, the young ladies in our office would fight at least once a day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi watched the bouncing little girl\u2019s figure leaving and laughed as she shook her head.</p><br/><p>While she had been at the Tang residence, because they valued men over women, she basically had the same existence as someone invisible. The fact that she did not get ditched and managed to survive was already very fortunate. When she returned to the Ning family, she was finally no longer invisible, but she had to live extremely cautiously under harsh and probing gazes\u2026</p><br/><p>It seemed like she had never experienced how normal people lived like, and how to interact with parents\u2026</p><br/><p>She was in a daze when suddenly, there was a text notification on her phone.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao, who had just gone abroad to Country F for work that morning, had sent quite a few texts in a row.</p><br/><p>[This morning, the temperatures dipped. I\u2019ve told Wan Wan to send clothes to you. Remember to wear it. Don\u2019t start enjoying the cold.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve brewed some bird\u2019s nest for you. You just have to put it in and set it to automatically stew. Do remember to eat it.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve taken a look at that script. It suits you very well, so you should take it.]</p><br/><p>[Miss me?]</p><br/><p>When she saw the last couple of words, the corners of Ning Xi\u2019s mouth could not help but curve up.</p><br/><p>Please! They just had not seen each other for five hours and he should have just alighted from the plane.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sprawled across the table as she smiled and replied with a text. \u201cIn the first second that you left, I missed you. In the second second that you left, I missed you and missed you. In the third second that you left, I missed you, missed you, missed you\u2026 I\u2019ve already missed you eighteen thousand times\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the lobby of Spirit, there was a clamorous noise of discussion.</p><br/><p>A group of staff looked over when they heard the commotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning, we\u2019re sorry. You can\u2019t enter without an appointment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning! Stop trying to charge in! Please don\u2019t make things hard for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning\u2026 Miss Ning\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They saw that the receptionist was blocking a woman, who was unexpectedly the boss of History, Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why\u2019s Ning Xueluo on our turf?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh! Is she still thinking of tearing down our store?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it! If she was tearing down our store, why would she come alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing again!? Whatever it is, it\u2019s definitely nothing good!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd saw that Ning Xueluo seemed very emotional. No matter how the receptionist pleaded with her, she would not listen. She just kept repeating, \u201cI have an emergency to see Ning Xi about! Please get her to come out to see me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff still did not let her in. Ning Xueluo was already very stirred up and continued to charge in. \u201cSister! Don\u2019t avoid me! What\u2019s between us should have settled already! Back then, no matter what you did to me, I can handle it, but this time, you\u2019ve gone overboard! If you have any hatred, feel free to come for me. I\u2019ll take it all! Why did you have to take it out on Mother?! You didn\u2019t even let go of an innocent child!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was an overload of information in Ning Xueluo\u2019s words, and all the surrounding stuff were instantly stupefied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that Ning Xueluo saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like she\u2019s saying that our boss did something to her mother? And she even said that Boss didn\u2019t even let go of a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p></div>\n</div>"}

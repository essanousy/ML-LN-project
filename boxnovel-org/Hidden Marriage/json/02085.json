He went straight to the elder.</p><br/><p>He then called, \u201cGrandfather.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandfather!</p><br/><p>What did Lu Tingxiao just call the elder?</p><br/><p>The elder was really thrilled to see his grandson-in-law. \u201cYou\u2019re back! Come and sit down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua could not hold it in anymore. He rushed up to Ning Zhiyuan. \u201cFather, this\u2026 What is this? You\u2026 you know Mr. Lu?\u201d</p><br/><p>The elder peered at his son and the relatives around unhappily. \u201cWhat are you guys being so shocked about? Can\u2019t I know my own grandson-in-law?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandson-in-law!</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi did actually get married to Tingxiao two years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Ning Yaohua was floored.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Xiao Xi had just returned to the country, the two of them were already together. Naturally, they got married, but due to Xiao Xi\u2019s career, they didn\u2019t announce it to the public,\u201d the elder said matter-of-factly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 Father, how could you not tell me of such a huge thing?!\u201d Ning Yaohua almost broke down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d The elder retorted back and Ning Yaohua felt like he wanted to die.</p><br/><p>As they heard Ning Zhiyuan and Ning Yaohua\u2019s conversation, everyone in the room were astounded.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Oh my god! Ning Xi\u2019s husband is Lu Tingxiao?! Seriously?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Tingxiao called the elder his grandfather. It can\u2019t be fake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, the rumored girlfriend of Lu Tingxiao\u2026 is Ning Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>They stared at each other, then the relatives of the Ning family looked at the Su family oddly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had gotten married to the Lu family long ago, so how could she be into Su Yan?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed man came in grinning. He said casually, \u201cWell, my sister-in-law said so. She has high standards!\u201d</p><br/><p>This person was Lu Tingxiao\u2019s brother, Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had always been high-profile, and since he had been working in the entertainment industry before, almost everyone knew how he looked like.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions darkened when they heard Lu Jingli\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Please! This was not just high-standard! This was high up in the sky!</p><br/><p>They thought that Ning Xi had just been trying to brag, but actually\u2026 she was already being humble.</p><br/><p>The relatives from the Su family looked horrified as they had mocked Ning Xi for using all sorts of methods to try to get into the Su family, especially Zheng Minjun. Her face reddened as if she had just been slapped hard and she could not say anything at the moment.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s smile was like a blooming flower. He went up to greet the elder, then he went beside Ning Qiutong and said, \u201cYou must be the beautiful aunt my sister-in-law mentioned! Hello, Aunty, I\u2019m Lu Jingli!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Qiutong was flattered. \u201cHello, thank you for looking after Xiao Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew a little about Xiao Xi\u2019s matters and had reminded her many times to be careful, but she never expected Xiao Xi\u2019s husband to be Lu Tingxiao.</p></div>\n</div>"}

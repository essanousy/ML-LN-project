His expression did not look like he was joking.</p><br/><p>\"Why do you suddenly have this thought? How can I believe that you\u2019re not just acting at the spur of the moment or...is this just a bad joke?\" Zhuang Liaoyuan\u2019s expression looked serious.</p><br/><p>The young man clenched his teeth. \"Father, I\u2019m serious about it. As for why, you know that I've never really had any huge ambitions. I just don\u2019t want people around me to worry about me. I also hope that I can protect the people I love if anything happens. I want to be someone you can rely on, and not just someone to be protected.\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan was truly surprised by his son\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>If Zhuang Rongguang said something like \"I want to protect my country and make my family proud\", he would never believe it.</p><br/><p>But yet he had uttered these.</p><br/><p>As Zhuang Liaoyuan was thinking it through, Zhuang Rongguang took out a scary long whip and gave it to his father. \"Father, I actually wanted to follow sister\u2019s advice and hide it from you, but I can\u2019t just let it be.\"</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s body trembled as he remembered what happened last night. \"Last night, I tried to get money on my own to leave the house, so I listened to Sun Bin and Liang Haoqiang. I went to the casino and was cheated. I lost five million dollars.\"</p><br/><p>\"What did you say!?\" Zhuang Liaoyuan smacked the table furiously as his expression changed.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang put the whip on the table and continued, \"They aren\u2019t local and there were a lot of them. I was actually expecting Sun Bin and Liang Haoqiang to come back with the money to save me but in the end, they abandoned me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Expecting the two of them to save you\u2026\" Zhuang Liaoyuan\u2019s expression darkened. \"How can my son be so stupid?\"</p><br/><p>\"I did something even more stupid afterwards.\" Zhuang Rongguang\u2019s voice went hoarse. \"I dared not call home. Without any more ideas, I called Sis\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"You bastard!\" Zhuang Liaoyuan threw his teacup away as uneasy thoughts suddenly floated in his mind. He freaked out. \"What happened to your sister last night?! Tell me!\"</p><br/><p>If something had not happened to Keer, there was no way he would change so drastically all of a sudden!</p><br/><p>With his experience, he could easily imagine what had happened last night. The moment he thought about what Keer might have gone through, his mind went haywire\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Sis brought the money over but they did not fulfill their promise. They wanted her...to stay with them for the night\u2026\"</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Zhuang Liaoyuan whipped the young man harshly. Zhuang Rongguang fell to the floor.</p><br/><p>The door was opened from outside. Zhuang Keer rushed in and stopped her father from hitting Zhuang Rongguang. \"Rongguang! Didn\u2019t I tell you not to tell Father!? What happened to you!?\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang\u2019s face went pale from the pain. \"Sis...I don\u2019t want to hide behind you anymore...I\u2019ll be responsible...I deserve it\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

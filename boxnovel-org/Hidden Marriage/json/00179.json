He had most likely predicted that the reporters would come swarming at her today, even the bodyguards and driver had all appeared in the nick of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Xi, where to next?\u201d The driver asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d Ning Xi paused for a moment and couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cWhy do you call me Miss Xi and not Miss Ning?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she thought carefully about it, the servants in the Lu residence and even Lu Tingxiao\u2019s subordinates all called her Miss Xi, or Miss Xiao Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was CEO Lu\u2019s orders.\u201d The driver replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That guy was too attentive\u2026 He probably knew that she didn\u2019t like the surname Ning!</p><br/><p>At the same time, at the Lu residence.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was collapsed on the sofa like a dead fish, \u201cBro! You\u2019ve already been browsing through those for an entire day! We have so many brilliant managers at our company, and you didn\u2019t take a liking to any of them? What about Lei Ming? He\u2019s been in the business for a long time, he has lots of experience and connections both here and abroad. He\u2019s already familiar with Ning Xi too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cHe\u2019s Jiang Muye\u2019s manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli: \u201cAlright\u2026 Then what about Hao Shuai? At least he has nothing to do with Jiang Muye, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cNo males.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cThen Ye Shenglan! One of our top managers! Her capabilities are top-notch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cHer sexual orientation is undetermined.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026 It\u2019s rumoured that she likes women\u2026 Crap! Bro, isn\u2019t your info a little too detailed?!\u201d Lu Jingli\u2019s expression was falling apart, \u201cThen Zhao Meixin should be okay, right? She\u2019s female, has a boyfriend, and she\u2019s the manager of Su Yimo, the number one actress in our company!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cHer character fails to meet the standards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was completely speechless. \u201cEven the emperor wasn\u2019t as picky as you when he was selecting his concubines! Then what exactly do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao muttered to himself for a moment before asking: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you give me Lin Zhizhi\u2019s information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Zhizhi\u2019s on break. She said that she doesn\u2019t want to take on a new artiste anytime soon. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s probably to avoid Jiang Muye, tsk tsk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll be Ning Xi\u2019s manager.\u201d Lu Tingxiao said decisively.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Bro, you\u2019re too evil\u2026 \u201c Lu Jingli couldn\u2019t help but have a moment of silence for Jiang Muye in his heart. When he was done, it was time to mourn for himself, \u201cYou\u2019re really good at giving me extra work! Lin Zhizhi\u2019s already said that she doesn\u2019t want to manage any new artistes!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two of them were in the midst of discussion, Ning Xi returned from outside\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m back! Is anyone at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as her voice finished echoing in the house, her leg was hugged by a soft little bun. The little bun even had an aggrieved expression on his face, as if they had parted for three years and not three hours.</p><br/><p>The little bun had become really attached to her recently. It was only after Ning Xi hugged and soothed him for a long while that he finally cracked a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back. Did everything go well with terminating your contract?\u201d Lu Tingxiao walked over to ask.</p><br/><p>When he mentioned the contract, Ning Xi got excited, \u201cIt went super well! The lawyer that the company arranged for me was really awesome! He fought alone against three lawyers and came out victorious in a war of words! Chang Li was trying to demand an exorbitant 60 million yuan from me at first, but I didn\u2019t have to spend a single cent in the end! Oh wait, I only spent 250 yuan on Ning Xueluo\u2019s medical fees! He was brilliant! Are the lawyers in Golden Age Entertainment\u2019s legal department all so awesome? I heard them call him the great Lawyer Chen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lu Jingli slowly spoke up from behind them: \u201cWhat do you mean the legal department of Golden Age? Chen Jing is the top legal consultant for the Lu Corporation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was so shocked that she would done a spit take if she had been drinking. She turned to Lu Tingxiao in utter disbelief, \u201cLu Tingxiao, you sent a specialised company lawyer who handles cases covering billions of yuan to help me settle a puny 8 million yuan case?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

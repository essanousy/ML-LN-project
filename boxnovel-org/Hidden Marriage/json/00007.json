He then spoke up coolly, \u201cYour request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, what request?\u201d Ning Xi did not understand the words that had appeared out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother wants to thank you for saving Little Treasure, he\u2019s asking you to state your request!\u201d Lu Jingli had the expression \u2018you struck gold this time\u2019 written all over his face.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the gears in Ning Xi\u2019s head spun quickly as she cautiously said, \u201cYou really don\u2019t need to thank me. It\u2019s true that I saved Little Treasure, but he also saved me. If it weren\u2019t for Little Treasure going out to call for help, then I would still be shut in there right now, so we can be considered even.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she was really lucky to have saved the little prince, how could she dare to claim a reward for it? The more money someone had, the more prone they were to paranoid delusions of being schemed against. Furthermore, this was the super rich, top-class elite Lu family they were talking about, it was already amazing that they were not suspecting her of directing the whole incident. Didn\u2019t you see how warily Lu Tingxiao had been looking at her just now?</p><br/><p>To avoid extra suffering later on, it was best to even out the relations between them.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had thought that there was no issue with her answer, but Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression remained displeased, causing a burst of fright in her heart.</p><br/><p>Did she say something wrong? Why was his expression so scary?</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, don\u2019t put on such a scary expression! We know you\u2019re trying to repay a debt of gratitude, but those who know nothing about the situation will think you\u2019re trying to take revenge!\u201d Lu Jingli could not bear seeing a beauty suffering fright, so he spoke up to break the ice. He then turned to Ning Xi and said, \u201cMy brother doesn\u2019t like to owe others, you should just request something! No need to be polite!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were even people that would force others into bringing up a request?</p><br/><p>The corner of her mouth twitched, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m being polite, you really don\u2019t need to repay me. What I said was the truth, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can go check\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Lu Tingxiao spoke simply and to the point. His face was starting to show hints of impatience.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli spoke up, \u201cThere was surveillance footage of the bar\u2019s storeroom. I\u2019ve already seen it, Little Treasure ran in on his own. As for you, the manager of the bar has already admitted that she was the one who locked you in, so you don\u2019t need to worry, we don\u2019t suspect your intentions. Since you did save Little Treasure, just ask for something!\u201d</p><br/><p>Great, we\u2019re right back where we started!</p><br/><p>In the end, Ning Xi had no other choice. Under Lu Tingxiao\u2019s increasingly forceful gaze, she summoned up her courage to say, \u201cThen\u2026 how about you give me money?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rich like to resolve debts in this simple and straightforward manner right?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao should also be the type to like solving problems with money!</p><br/><p>If she didn\u2019t ask for money, then wouldn\u2019t they think that she was eyeing something else? If not money, then people?</p><br/><p>Just as Ning Xi was assured that this was the most appropiate request she could put forward, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression became even uglier.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was on the verge of tears. Why did he have to be so taciturn? If you have something to say, just say it out! Would speaking a few more words kill you?</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli, the translating machine, rubbed his nose, \u201cMy brother thinks that just giving you money would be too insulting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was howling in her heart: It\u2019s okay!! Just insult me!!!!</p><br/><p>The Lu family\u2019s status was too special and she just could not think of an appropriate request at the moment. Just as they were about to come to a deadlock, Lu Tingxiao spoke up\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went completely lifeless for a second, before coughing fiercely, almost choking to death on her own spit, \u201cCough cough cough\u2026\u2026what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>After finally managing to stop her coughing, she hurriedly turned towards Lu Jingli with intensity.</p><br/><p>Second Young Master, please translate!!!</p><br/><p>However, this time it was not only Ning Xi, but also Lu Jingli who was completely dazed. \u201cBrother, what do you mean? I can\u2019t even translate for you this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, good fortune arrived and a lightbulb went off in Ning Xi\u2019s head. She said falteringly, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve decided to repay me with your body because I saved your son?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao inclined his head slightly. After slight thought, he nodded, \u201cYou could put it that way.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

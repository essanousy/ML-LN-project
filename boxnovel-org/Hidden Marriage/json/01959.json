Even Little Treasure was willing to leave his mother\u2019s side for the sake of his little sister or brother. Of course, it was not nice of him to always go over for meals.</p><br/><p>No one could understand the pain of singletons!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, you look so cool when you\u2019re cooking!\u201d Ning Xi complimented Lu Tingxiao when she saw him so focused on cooking.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m only cool when cooking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cool anytime!\u201d Ning Xi added.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled and kissed the girl\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of greasy in here. Wait for me outside for about half an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wanted to stay with Lu Tingxiao, but she was worried she might eat him up before the meal, so in the end, she walked out of the kitchen.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After dinner, Lu Jingli wanted to go back, but Lu Tingxiao asked him to stay when he saw that it was already pretty late.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, Sister-in-law, would I be bothering you by staying here?\u201d Lu Jingli grinned mischievously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you can go back now,\u201d said Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I drank some wine\u2026 I\u2019m kind of sleepy. I\u2019ll go to bed first. Good night, everyone!\u201d Lu Jingli swiftly sprinted to the bedroom to avoid being chased away.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a deep and low roar from afar.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was taken aback and he looked out of the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cA wild beast?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao frowned. \u201cTiger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA tiger?!\u201d Ning Xi could not believe it.</p><br/><p>Deer Town was not developed, but for a tiger to be around here?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat roar\u2026 It\u2019s not a zoo tiger,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>The roar was powerful. Judging by the decibels, the creature should be about 10 kilometers away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli rushed down from the bedroom in his shorts. \u201cWhat happened? Are you guys watching the Animal Discovery channel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be an animal that\u2019s escaped from the zoo,\u201d guessed Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d Lu Jingli was shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? There\u2019s nothing around here, not even a zoo! There\u2019s no zoo in town and no wild beasts too! Most of them are deer and little bunnies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think the beast would just wander around the zoo after it\u2019s escaped?\u201d Ning Xi asked rhetorically.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli had no comeback.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, Sister-in-law, I think I should leave first,\u201d Lu Jingli suddenly said.</p><br/><p>He had gone to a relative\u2019s house when he was little and had been chased by a tiger, so he was traumatized by that experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not afraid of meeting it halfway, then go.\u201d Lu Tingxiao stood up and brought Ning Xi upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scare me like that, bro!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli looked out of the window. It was pitch black and visibility was limited.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if it\u2019s a tiger? I\u2019d eat it alive!\u201d As he mumbled, in the end, he still went back to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a corner of Deer Town.</p><br/><p>There was a white tiger which was twice as large as a normal tiger padding forward. Any normal person would have been shocked if they saw it.</p><br/><p>There was a young man on the white tiger\u2019s back and he seemed to be unconscious.</p><br/><p>After half an hour, the white tiger and the young man arrived at Ning Xi\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>Roar!</p><br/><p>It let out a deep roar as if it would crumble the earth, echoing through people\u2019s hearts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He quickly grabbed Ning Xuelo, \u201cXuelo, you need to calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo did not notice Ning Xi\u2019s little trick and cried, tears trickling down. \u201cYan brother, I need to say something to my sister about it. You know how painful these days have been for me and that I\u2019m remorseful. I really hope she can forgive me! Otherwise I\u2019ll really\u2026\u2026\u201d (die? Feel free)</p><br/><p>Su Yan really didn\u2019t know what to do. Looking at the heart broken woman, sobbing her heart out in his arms, his heart softened. \u201cNing Xi, sorry. Xuelo is really blaming herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo smiled internally when she heard his words. On the surface she appeared even sadder, but was secretly looking forward to Ning Xi\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>In the past, anytime she begged for forgiveness, Ning Xi would be very angry, saying terrible things which caused Su Yan to her more each time.</p><br/><p>This time certainly\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi frowned a bit, then sighed, \u201cWell Ning Xuelo, I saw your apology (the post) and also received it. Since it\u2019s a misunderstanding, just forget it. I forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026what did you say?\u201d Ning Xuelo\u2019s face instantly changed, as if she couldn\u2019t</p><br/><p>believe it.</p><br/><p>Su Yan is very pleased, \u201cXuelo, you can rest assured now right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo cannot say a word, her face turning black.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the dressing room door opened, and Little Treasure came out in the new set of clothes.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s hypocritical mask immediately fell off, her face flashing with true warmth as she smiled and walked to pick him up, then said to the clerk, \u201cWe\u2019ll take all the clothes and he\u2019ll wear this one directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood,good.\u201d The clerk replied with a smile \u201cI\u2019ll go and get your bill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded to Su Yan, then holding Little Treasure, walked away.</p><br/><p>Behind, a bodyguard dressed in black payed the bill, then carried the bag out.</p><br/><p>Watching this scene, Ning Xuelo looked dumbfounded, then her face quickly changed to one of excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time, Fang Lin and Xuan Xuan said that they saw Ning Xi buying children\u2019s clothes but I didn\u2019t believe it! Sister she\u2026..did she really marry an old man and give him a son\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they left too fast and she did not have time to see the child\u2019s face or take a picture as evidence\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXuelo! Stop this nonsense!\u201d Su Yan immediately interrupted her, his tone serious while his eyes looked in the direction of Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Su Yan: \u201cI have seen this child once. Ning Xi said he was the son of a friend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo replied hurriedly, \u201cYan brother, you are too naive. Just the son of a friend and she has bodyguards following? She used a black card just now. How many people need a bodyguard for their children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan face showed a hint of hesitation and struggle, as he couldn\u2019t decide what to think. He then replied in a firm voice, \u201cXuelo, in my heart Ning Xi is my little sister. To insult her is to insult me! Don\u2019t let me hear that! Others may doubt her but we can\u2019t, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo never expected that Su Yan would say this kind of thing. His attitude towards Ning Xi had undergone such a big change.</p><br/><p>Damn, that day in the hospital. Ning Xi, in the end, did you feed him a magic potion? Su Yan suddenly believed Ning Xi, and even her words aren\u2019t heard\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

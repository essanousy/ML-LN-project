She threw her bags aside and went straight to him.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, you\u2019re back!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao put his laptop on the table and carefully pulled her onto his lap. \"I brought you some gifts.\"</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t need any, you\u2019re my best gift!\"</p><br/><p>Lu TIngxiao smiled. \"Do you have honey on your mouth?\"</p><br/><p>\"Want to have a taste?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes looked away. \"I remember...your leg is not completely healed\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was suddenly nervous. \"N...no! There\u2019s still a scar! Look!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao squinted at her. \"Did you use the ointment I gave you before?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve been using it everyday!

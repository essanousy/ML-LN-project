She hoped that it was not something urgent\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi got up quickly and opened the door.</p><br/><p>She was dumbfounded when she saw who was at her door. Dozens of people stood in front, all of them the actors and crew from the drama team, and leading the posse was Ning Xueluo in a gorgeous dress, together with Fang Ya hanging onto her arm eagerly\u2026</p><br/><p>In her sleepy phase, it took her a few seconds to remember that someone had told her that Ning Xueluo was having a party tonight.</p><br/><p>So, why were all these people here instead of at Ning Xueluo\u2019s place?</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo sounded apologetic, \"Ning Xi, did we wake you up? We\u2019re really sorry, we didn\u2019t expect you to sleep so early. We\u2019re having a party tonight, and since you didn\u2019t come, we all missed you. Knowing that you just stay just upstairs, we decided to come by and say hi!\"</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Ning Xi\u2019s reply, Fang Ya went on, \"Xueluo, I\u2019m pretty sure Ning Xi doesn\u2019t mind, right, Ning Xi? Everyone, let\u2019s go in! Let's not block the entrance!\"</p><br/><p>Both of them stepped into the house, followed by everyone else.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi just stood there, looking upset. Since they had already decided to come in, what else could she say?</p><br/><p>This Fang Ya was a fence-sitter, who would side whoever had the advantage. When Ning Xi had just been signed with Glory World, Fang Ya tried to get on her good side, but Ning Xi doubted the sincerity of her intentions, so she ignored her.</p><br/><p>By the looks of it, she now sided with Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>After they entered the house, Fang Ya kept on complaining, \"Eh, Ning Xi, why is your place so small? There isn't enough place to stand!\"</p><br/><p>Actually, Ning Xi\u2019s space was not small at all. It was suitable for living and there were just too many of them. The fact that the whole living room was now filled with the unexpected guests made the place look small and narrow.</p><br/><p>Without bothering to ask for permission, Fang Ya opened up Ning Xi\u2019s closet. With hesitation she exclaimed, \"Ning Xi is this your closet? It\u2019s so small!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone who was trying to please Ning Xueluo played along with Fang Ya.</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, it\u2019s really small! Let\u2019s not talk about your living room or bedroom; the most important thing for an artiste is their closet. Surely you wouldn\u2019t have enough to wear with a closet this small!\"</p><br/><p>\"I was wondering how rich Glory World was, but it\u2019s so underwhelming! I could barely live here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey guys, don't be so insensitive. Not everyone can stay in houses like Xueluo\u2019s!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo felt tremendously smug hearing everyone criticizing Ning Xi, although she acted kindly and said, \"Ning Xi\u2019s unit is in a good location and it's got a fantastic view!\"</p><br/><p>\"What good can the view do? We don\u2019t really stay at home much anyway!\"</p><br/><p>As she was speaking Fang Ya went through Ning Xi\u2019s clothes that were hanging outside, and tsked in pity, \"Oh god! There\u2019s not even anything that\u2019s presentable. Isn't this from last year\u2019s Chanel line? And this Prada, it\u2019s so outdated\u2026Ning Xi, you really need to put more effort into this. It doesn\u2019t matter how good your acting is because acting skills should not be your priority. The most important thing is the packaging you come in!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stood beside her closet, realizing what their purpose was of coming here tonight.</p><br/><p>They were all here to deliberately cause her trouble and laugh at her, weren't they?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Lu Tingxiao\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao hastily threw aside what he was holding and ran next to the bathroom door, \u201cNing Xi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Tingxiao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet in here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Go in?</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up! Hurry, hurry! Ahhhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 are you alright?\u201d Lu Tingxiao was getting more and more nervous, but he didn\u2019t dare to simply push the door open and enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy leg is cramping! It\u2019s cramping! Hurry up and help me! Oww\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao facepalmed in both relief and helplessness before quickly pushing open the door and entering.</p><br/><p>The water was cold so there wasn\u2019t any vapor inside. After being thoroughly soaked, her clothing had become completely transparent. Lu Tingxiao swallowed slightly. Even though he hadn\u2019t been drugged, his degree of suffering wasn\u2019t any less than Ning Xi\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Tingxiao\u2026 Lu Tingxiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s urging brought him back to reality. Lu Tingxiao quickly walked over, \u201cWhich leg is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe right leg! The right leg!\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s face had turned white from the pain.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao simply dispensed with formalities and quickly used one hand to hold her ankle and the other to hold her thigh. Then, he began to massage her with some force.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no! It\u2019s still cramping! Use a little more strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! It hurts! Gentler!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it okay now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost there, almost there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In just a few minutes\u2019 time, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s entire body had become covered in sweat. Exhausted, he gently set down her leg.</p><br/><p>A second later, Lu Tingxiao suddenly noticed the many glaring red rope marks on her body and her legs. His expression immediately turned cold. \u201cWhat happened to your body? Did Zhu Xiangcheng do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy body?\u201d Ning Xi subconsciously touched her thigh where it was slightly sore, \u201cAre you talking about these? I got them from the suspension wires today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression relax. However, he quickly frowned again, \u201cI\u2019ll go get some medicine for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he looked at her worriedly, \u201cDon\u2019t keep soaking. You\u2019ll get sick if you go on like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi instinctively sunk deeper into the water and used her fingers to form a ten, \u201cTen minutes. Just give me ten more minutes. I was almost fully recovered, but when you came in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Fine.</p><br/><p>He exited the bathroom and then opened the hotel room door once more.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Lu Jingli came tumbling inside again.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Within a second, Lu Jingli crawled to his feet and bowed, \u201cBro, I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ll leave immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on. Go down and help me buy some medicine.\u201d Lu Tingxiao stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of medicine?\u201d Lu Jingli wagged his tail, wearing an ambiguous expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything for bruising and such.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s eyes immediately lit up like lamps, \u201cBro, you finally showed off your prowess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s icy gaze fixed onto him.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was wrong. If you finally showed your prowess, how could it have been so short? This lowly one will go run the errand right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not even five minutes later, Lu Jingli had already come running back after buying the medicine. He spoke with a virtuous expression, \u201cBro, why don\u2019t you just let me stand guard outside? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if I could go run errands for you at any time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao cast him a side glance, \u201cIf I see you a third time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the consequences would be very grave\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli could only let out a sigh of regret. Then, he sneakily fished out a little square box from his pocket, \u201cBro, I bought you this in passing. It\u2019s definitely better than the ones provided by the hotel. Are you sure you don\u2019t want it? Ow\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had been thrown out with a kick.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

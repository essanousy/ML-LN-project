When she saw Ning Xi\u2019s appearance after showering, she was stunned momentarily.</p><br/><p>In front of her is a girl so beautiful, with her skin rosy after the shower. She looks very attractive, and even a woman couldn\u2019t help but feel her heart throb. It was no wonder the young master\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The servant quickly recovered and shook his head saying, \u201cMiss Ning Xi, the young master told me to send up some food. Although the body\u2019s image is important, you cannot go hungry. Here are some low calorie food. Eating a little won\u2019t matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you!\u201d Looking at the cute little maid, Ning Xi nervousness eased a lot and she said, \u201cWan Wan, your hairstyle is really cute. It really suits you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much Miss Xi!\u201d The servant happily touched her hair, then hesitantly began, \u201cMiss Xi, you are a really good person! In fact, I think you are especially good with the young master. If you become his mother, we will support you. Otherwise, if we end up with some other scheming woman, we will become miserable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why are even the maids beginning to assist?</p><br/><p>Leave me alone!</p><br/><p>There came another knock on the door and it was Wan Wan who gave her a cup of milk.</p><br/><p>A knock sounded for the third time. Ning Xi was sitting on the balcony drying her hair and thought it was Wan Wan so she just invited her in.</p><br/><p>As a result, the footsteps are getting closer and Ning Xi senses something is wrong.</p><br/><p>As she turned, sure enough it was Lu Ting Xiao standing close to her face\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi subconsciously clenched the railing, \u201cIs something wrong?</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao did not answer, but quietly stood in front of her while staring.</p><br/><p>The girl in front of him is wearing an ankle length skirt and pajama that is tight in the right places. Her hair is slightly damp, fluttering gently in the night breeze, and he cheeks are slightly flushed and damp. Her smart eyes flash with a trance of fear and preparedness\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was staring at him numb until Lu Ting Xiao finally spoke, \u201cNing Xi \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cYes \u2026 \u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao:\u201d I miss you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly staring at him, almost believing that she was having an auditory hallucination,</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 what \u2026 \u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s hand gently picked up a strand of her and tucked it behind her ear.</p><br/><p>In a cold tone, he answered, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s obviously only been two days okay?</p><br/><p>Ah, this is not the time for that! Focus!</p><br/><p>The focus is that Lu Ting Xiao has been thinking about her? He then said it directly to her? This isn\u2019t the right development of ah!</p><br/><p>She must definitely be dreaming, right? She definitely is!</p><br/><p>However, instead of listening to the excuses for her behavior, Lu Ting Xiao stepped forward, one hand circling her waist. At the same time, his other hand also rose and hugged her. He leaned, with a very tired and loving gesture, and gently buried his face in her neck.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, he quickly adopted a flattering attitude, \u201cHas CEO Lu also taken a fancy to this girl? Well, since it\u2019s like that, please go right ahead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room who had been watching the scene unfold was shocked. What sort of situation was this?</p><br/><p>Every time Lu Tingxiao came out to social gatherings, he was like a cold and detached lone wolf, and he was completely resistant to feminine charms. However, today, he was actually interested in a woman who had drunkenly barged into the wrong room?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao ignored their reactions. At the moment, he was only focused on one person.</p><br/><p>He furrowed his brows as he looked at the girl who was swaying in his embrace, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu\u2026\u201d Ning Xi caught herself right before she accidentally addressed him directly by name. She stammered in reply, \u201cI walked into the wrong room\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The lighting in the room was rather dim. She hadn\u2019t noticed that Lu Tingxiao was also here.</p><br/><p>Amid a sea of beer bellies, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s presence was like a breath of fresh air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich room are you guys in? I\u2019ll bring you there.\u201d Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t even bother glancing at the mixed expressions from the people behind him. Instead, he directly escorted Ning Xi out.</p><br/><p>Just now, he had been resting with his eyes closed. He had vaguely heard the room roar with laughter, but he hadn\u2019t paid much attention. It wasn\u2019t until he heard Ning Xi\u2019s familiar voice that he opened his eyes to see that Zhu Xiangcheng was actually pulling her and getting physical with her as well.</p><br/><p>In that instant, he suddenly felt the urge to snap off the man\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to scare her, so he suppressed his malicious, dark thoughts and approached her, pretending to be a stranger to help her get out of her quandary.</p><br/><p>After exiting the room, Ning Xi was finally able to relax. \u201cLu Tingxiao, thank you. If it weren\u2019t for you, I probably would have gotten into trouble tonight!\u201d If words had not worked with that person, she would have been forced to resort to physical violence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with getting into trouble? I\u2019m here to help you clean up any trouble. If you encounter a situation like this in the future, you\u2019re not allowed to let yourself be taken advantage of again!\u201d Lu Tingxiao lectured her with a grave expression.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed and sighed, \u201cAy, it really feels great to have someone back me up!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Little Treasure no longer needed her and the time came for her to leave the Lu home, would she and Lu Tingxiao become strangers?</p><br/><p>For some reason, that thought made her feel a trace of sadness\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao ruffled the girl\u2019s hair. I could support you for a lifetime if you would let me.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi waved away the forbidden thoughts running in her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine now. I can go back on my own!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be fine on your own?\u201d Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t look reassured at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. You should hurry and go back in!\u201d Ning Xi waved her hand as she walked backwards.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had known ahead of time that her crew would be here for dinner, which was why he had accepted the invitation from those people earlier to this boring party.</p><br/><p>Of course, he also knew which room Ning Xi was in.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when he saw Ning Xi walking away in the wrong direction, Lu Tingxiao sighed helplessly. He caught up to her within a few strides, \u201cForget it, I\u2019ll send you back! What\u2019s your room number?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s 801!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c801 isn\u2019t in this direction.\u201d Lu Tingxiao held her up and guided her in the right direction.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t stop until he had delivered her to the door. \u201cGo in and don\u2019t run all over the place again. If you have to go to the restroom, bring a friend with you. If you can\u2019t find someone, asking Jiang Muye is fine too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfft, asking Jiang Muye to accompany her to the restroom?</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it! Thanks for personally bringing me back, Big Boss Lu!\u201d Ning Xi reached out her hands and made a heart sign.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled as the remaining dark thoughts in his mind were completely erased, \u201cSend me a text when you leave later. Let\u2019s go back together.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m just telling you my judgment based on past situations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone fell silent.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi already did not have time to think further. Her fingers trembled as she quickly made a call to Annie. \u201cHello, Annie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro Xi, you finally called me. I was afraid you\u2019re busy, so I didn\u2019t dare to disturb you\u2026\u201d From the other end of the phone came Annie\u2019s joyful voice.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi interrupted Annie apologetically, \u201cAnnie, I\u2019m sorry, where are you right now? Can you make a trip to Imperial Military Hospital? I have something urgent that I need you for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHospital? Bro Xi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Annie quickly asked with concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t me. Just come over first.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard that Ning Xi was alright, Annie let out a sigh of relief and answered, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come over right away, but I\u2019m now in City A. I might not be able to rush over so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>From beside Ning Xi came Lu Tingxiao\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange for a helicopter to get her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately said, \u201cSend me your location. I\u2019ll get someone to pick you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she hung up, Ning Xi\u2019s body gave way and she was about to collapse.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao held the girl in his embrace, glancing at the time on his watch with his solemn eyes.</p><br/><p>From City A to Imperial, even if it were by helicopter, it would take more than an hour to and fro.</p><br/><p>Time passed by and the atmosphere became increasingly heavy\u2026</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao hugged Ning Xi as she consoled her, \u201cLittle Treasure will definitely be fine. That Satan\u2019s probably trying to mess with you again, deliberately scaring you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi closed her eyes and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Even though Yun Shen was not quite reliable most of the time, when it came to matters like these, if he did not have complete certainty, he would not have said what he did.</p><br/><p>So, she could basically be sure that what he said was true\u2026</p><br/><p>Earlier, Lu Tingxiao had been concentrating on operating a certain complex software on his phone as if he was directing something.</p><br/><p>It was not sure how long had passed when the deadly silent corridor suddenly echoed with the sound of a handphone ringing. It was Lu Tingxiao\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao immediately clicked to answer. \u201cHello? Okay, send it to me now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly changed in expression. \u201cWhy? Has the footage been recovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded. \u201cIt has.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat footage?\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao asked with confusion.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang explained simply the whole situation as best as he could. He finished by saying, \u201cIf the footage is recovered, then we can find out who it was that had quietly taken Little Treasure away from the hospital and sent him to the Lu family!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s phone was receiving a file.</p><br/><p>The progress bar advanced bit by bit. Moments later, with a beep, the file was finally transferred successfully.</p><br/><p>Everyone held their breaths with their eyes locked onto Lu Tingxiao\u2019s phone screen.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s fists were clenched even more tightly\u2026</p><br/><p>Who\u2026?</p><br/><p>Who was it?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s long fingers quickly clicked to open the security footage.</p><br/><p>The scene in the security footage had a cold, deathly stillness. It was clearly in the hospital morgue.</p><br/><p>The door opened and a staff carried a bundled baby in, putting it into a freezer, then turning to leave.</p><br/><p>The instant she saw that thing in the staff\u2019s arms, even though you could only vaguely see that it was a baby that had turned purple, Ning Xi\u2019s heart subconsciously jumped.</p><br/><p>Was that Little Treasure?</p><br/><p>As she thought about this, the door of the morgue was pushed open once again. A thin figure in a black outfit with a cap had walked in.</p><br/><p>Because that person\u2019s back was facing the camera, they could not get a better look at the face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis should be the person!\u201d Tang Lang exclaimed emotionally.</p><br/><p>That person opened the freezer and carried the dead baby that the staff had just put in. Then, he or she very quickly closed the freezer and turned to leave.</p><br/><p>In the next second, when that person turned around\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi, Tang Lang, Tang Ye, Feng Xiaoxiao, and even Yun Shen who were fixed on the video\u2026 all had a change in their expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnie!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could it be?</p><br/><p>How could it be Annie?</p></div>\n</div>"}

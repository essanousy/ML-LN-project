She's my wife\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi noticed the devil's emotions and quickly comforted him, \"Hey, my dear, don't be unhappy. The director told me that I did well today and wants to invite me again! I've thought about it already. I'll go again after our movie airs, then I'll attend the show in a male outfit.

He...even asked my father for advice on shooting technique\u2026</p><br/><p>\"My brother has always had a bad relationship with my father.

Thank you so much, Xiao Xi!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was really happy when she heard Zhuang Keer's update. \"There's no need to thank me. I just don't like anyone to bully my friend, not even your brother!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer was really touched. \"Alright, see you tomorrow. Also, please drop by my house for dinner tomorrow night. My grandfather really likes you and told me to invite you! If you don't mind, please come!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

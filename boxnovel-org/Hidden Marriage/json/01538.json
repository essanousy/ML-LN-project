In fact, as a normal man, he was pretty happy to do so\u2026</p><br/><p>His assistant was getting smarter. She knew to look for him in case of an emergency!</p><br/><p>On the stage.</p><br/><p>\"Ms. Ning and Mr. Su are really the perfect couple. What more can you expect from our role model married couple?

We also wish that Xueluo will be able to win the award tonight, making achievements in both your love life and career. Alright, let's welcome them in!\"</p><br/><p>Although it was just Ning Xueluo and Su Yan, they took quite some time on the red carpet. After all, she was one of the popular candidates.

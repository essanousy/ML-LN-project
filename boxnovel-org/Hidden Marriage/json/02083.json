He only hoped that this dirty stain would immediately vanish from this world forever.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had still been a little hesitant. He thought that they should not air their dirty laundry. If word ever got out, it would still be him who would be humiliated.</p><br/><p>But, at this moment, he was already determined to send Ning Xi to jail. He wanted to completely eradicate this evil creature from everyone\u2019s line of sight. Otherwise, in the future, he would not know how many more embarrassing things would arise.</p><br/><p>When Zheng Minjun saw that Ning Xi was definitely done for this time, fueled by the anger from her grandchild being killed, she ripped her apart on the spot. \u201cNing Xi, don\u2019t have an ounce of wishful thinking. For a woman like you, as long as I\u2019m around, you don\u2019t have to think about marrying Su Yan in this lifetime!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard those words, Ning Qiutong was about to explode in anger. If Ning Xi had not held her down, she would have walked off in a rage.</p><br/><p>She knew that Su Yan was Ning Xi\u2019s greatest wound. Originally, she was worried about Ning Xi, yet she saw that Ning Xi was not angry and was smiling instead. She was gazing down as the corners of her lips curled up. That smile complemented the girl\u2019s extraordinarily quiet and elegant face, making her look extremely breathtaking\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked down and laughed softly, then she looked up at Zheng Minjun. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have high standards. I\u2019m afraid your son doesn\u2019t make it into my line of sight. Besides, I\u2019ve already gotten married two years ago, and I\u2019m not interested in re-marrying, Madam Su. You\u2019re overthinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 really have the chit to talk big!\u201d Zheng Minjun\u2019s temper flared on the spot. This witch was actually boasting of her high standards and saying that she did not fancy their Su Yan.</p><br/><p>The second she finished, the second half of Ning Xi\u2019s sentence suddenly sunk in and she was stunned. \u201cWhat did you say? You\u2019re married?\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant Ning Xi spoke up, Su Yan\u2019s expression abruptly changed too.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was already married?</p><br/><p>In fact, she had already been married two years ago?!</p><br/><p>Su Yan did not care to think twice. He just blurted out, \u201cXiao Xi, what do you mean? You\u2019re married? How could this be?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged indifferently at Su Yan. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do I need to report my getting married to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else in the room seemed to not have expected this too. They all exchanged glances in shock as they buzzed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! Ning Xi\u2019s already married? I\u2019ve never heard of that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say! The people in the entertainment industry need to keep things like this a secret! Once they\u2019re married, they\u2019re worth nothing! Besides, who knows which old fellow she\u2019s married to! Would she want to announce that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis girl is so fearless. Could her brazenness be because of that husband of hers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft, she\u2019s just a small actress! Besides, she wasn\u2019t that popular two years ago. What good family could she marry into? It\u2019s most likely just a newly-made rich guy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When Ning Xueluo heard that Ning Xi was already married, she was clearly startled too. However, she very quickly returned to ridiculing her internally.</p><br/><p><em>She\u2019s just a worn-out good that\u2019s been married before! She can forget about fighting for Su Yan with me.</em></p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua looked at her despicably with disdain. \u201cNing Xi, I\u2019m telling you! I don\u2019t care what trash you\u2019re married to, or what backing you have. Even if God himself came today, it would be useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, there was the sound of steady footsteps coming closer from afar.</p><br/><p>Almost the instant Ning Yaohua finished with his roar, the ward door was pushed open by long, slender fingers.</p><br/><p>The person who entered had a tall figure and an icy face. The air around him was extremely cold as if he had swept a world of ice and snow along with him. His cold, pit-like eyes with a chilly gaze skimmed everyone in the ward. His low and raspy, frosty voice rang in everyone\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

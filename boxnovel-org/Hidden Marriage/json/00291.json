At what speed were you riding that? Why're you riding\nmy precious ride like any other rides? Are you looking down on me?\"\n</p><br/><p>He\nfinally beat Xi once, yet there was not a tinge of pride in his\nsuccess. Instead, he was laughed at by everyone, even worse than losing.\n</p><br/><p>\"Exactly, Xi, you're too mean! We've all been waiting for you here for at least half an hour now!\"\n</p><br/><p>\"Xi,\nyou're so annoying! You made me lose a kiss, but I won't honour it. Ah\nKa didn't even win it fairly! You must compete again before I'll be\nconvinced!\"\n</p><br/><p>\"Sure, we can compete again, I'm not afraid! I want to beat him fair and square!\"\n</p><br/><p>...\n</p><br/><p>Everyone\nstarted to speak over one another while Ning Xi did not say a word, as\nshe took of her helmet, got off the vehicle, let the ride lean steadily\non the side and slowly carried Little Treasure who was on the back seat.\n</p><br/><p>\"Eh? Xi, what's on your backseat?\"\n</p><br/><p>\"Why does it look like a kid? Xi, you didn't kidnap him, did you? You can't do such immoral things okay!\"\n</p><br/><p>\"Exactly! Xi, you're usually so secretive. It wouldn't be because you're from a children trafficking organisation, are you?\"\n</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took the helmet off Little Treasure, rolled her eyes at everyone, and angrily replied, \"Please! This is my son!\"\n</p><br/><p>\"What??? Xi, you have a son!?\" Xiang Xiang looked like her world was crumbling. \"You actually have a son this old, no way!\"\n</p><br/><p>\"Jesus! Xi is actually married? And even has a son?\"\n</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone surrounded the little boy beside Ning Xi.\n</p><br/><p>The\nhappiest person then was definitely Ah Ka. He was so angry earlier but\nnow he felt overjoyed, \"Xi, my good bro! You're amazing! You even have a\nlittle one! Good one! Look at your precious son with his big eyes. You\nbetter be honest with us, your wife must be a beauty right?\"\n</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, my wife...\" Ning Xi touched her chin and thought about Lu Tingxiao's ice cold face and said, \"is indeed beautiful!\"\n</p><br/><p>Ah Ka suddenly burst out laughing, \"Hahaha...I knew it! Xiang Xiang, you can give up now!\"\n</p><br/><p>Xiang\nXiang stomped her feet and whined as she clung onto Ning Xi, \"I don't\nbelieve you! Xi, is your wife as pretty as me? You don't like me at all?\nYou even let me kiss you!\"\n</p><br/><p>The moment Xiang Xiang got close to\nNing Xi, she abruptly felt her back go cold. She looked down and saw\nthat the cute kid was looking at her with ice cold eyes, akin to a\nlittle werewolf who was defending its territory.\n</p><br/><p>Ning Xi cleared her throat before she picked up Little Treasure and comforted him.\n</p><br/><p>The\nmoment the little guy was carried by Ning Xi, he changed from a little\nwerewolf back to a cute little bun again. His short little hand clung\nonto Ning Xi's neck while his head leaned on her shoulders obediently.\n</p><br/><p>Ning\nXi comforted the little bun on one hand and looked apologetically at\nXiang Xiang on the other hand and said, \"I'm sorry, Xiang Xiang, those\nwere just the rules of the game. If I had led you on in any way, I'm\ntruly sorry. I've only got eyes for my son's mother, she is the only one\nI will love the most forever!\"\n</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hopped on this good opportunity to let Xiang Xiang give up on her.\n</p><br/>\n</div>"}

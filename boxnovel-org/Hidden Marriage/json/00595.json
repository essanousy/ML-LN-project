He was so determined, even using \"benefactress\" to address her now!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pinched the space between her eyebrows, sitting right across Xi Shiqing as she released a long sigh, \"Bro, what are you doing? Why have you suddenly decided to become a monk?\"</p><br/><p>\"I made this decision after quite a long consideration. If you, Benefactress Ning, are here to persuade me, you may leave now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is it because of me?\" Ning Xi asked directly.</p><br/><p>\"It was all my decision, it is unrelated to anyone.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a deep breath and probed further, \"May I know why? Even if it was because of what happened last night when you found out that there\u2019s someone else whom I like, you don\u2019t have to go so far. This is too illogical\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Everything is just momentary. A moment of heaven, a moment of hell, a moment of life, a moment of death.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was on the verge of crying. \"Dear Lord, can you please speak like a normal person?\"</p><br/><p>She was feeling genuinely terrified!</p><br/><p>\"Benefactress Ning, if you feel guilty, you don\u2019t have to because it truly is my own decision,\" Xi Shiqing replied.</p><br/><p>\"What about your parents and your grandfather? Don\u2019t you care about them anymore? They\u2019ve been with you through the years and now you just suddenly decided to become a monk and desert them?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is my fate. They still have Shixuan.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi recalled him mentioning that he had a younger brother.</p><br/><p>He really had everything well thought out and was fully resolved to become a monk!</p><br/><p>\"My Lord, Mr. Xi, Qingqing? Can you please give it some more thought? Becoming a monk is not a trivial matter! Three days! Just wait three more days to think it over. It\u2019s not too late to make your decision by then!\" Ning Xi tried to persuade him.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve already finalized my decision. Please return now and from now on, you may address me by my Buddhist name, Yuanqing.\" Xi Shiqing gestured for her to exit the room.</p><br/><p>\"Yuanqing...Xi Shiqing! Why are you being so stubborn?\" Ning Xi\u2019s eyes were burning with rage and frustration. He looked so soft and gentle but he sure was stubborn like an ox!</p><br/><p>She almost wanted to knock him out and bring him back by force!</p><br/><p>Xi Shiqing still did not move an inch, sitting in his place like an old rock.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was already tired from all the talking but she was still not able to persuade him. Suddenly, she got another phone call from her grandfather.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went out of the room to pick up the call. \"Hello, Grandfather\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Xi, what took you so long? How did it go?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s heart sank with disappointment in herself. \"I\u2019m sorry, Grandfather, I\u2019ve tried my best, but...it\u2019s not working\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The elder sighed, \"Well, I expected this to happen. Come back here, Xiao Xi!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi ground out between her teeth, \"Don\u2019t worry, Grandfather. Please wait for a little while. Go and find someplace to rest and have a meal, I\u2019ll try again.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay...don\u2019t overexert yourself! And wait, Uncle Xi wants to talk to you.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

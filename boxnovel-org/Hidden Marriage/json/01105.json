If she doesn't die\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"She will surely die!\" Guan Rui\u2019s eyes flashed with the intention to kill.</p><br/><p>If she did not die, he had already arranged for his own people to take care of it at the hospital. Nothing would go wrong.</p><br/><p>It\nwas her first time getting involved in matters related to a person\u2019s\nlife. Guan Ziyao\u2019s fingers were shaking with nervousness but she quickly\ncalmed down. She was just trying to stop the woman from continuing to\nfool Lu Tingxiao. What she was doing was not wrong\u2026</p><br/><p>Her plans had\nfailed so many times. There could not be any more accidents this time.\nExtreme situations require extreme measures.</p><br/><p>This time, she would make sure there was no turning back for Ning Xi!</p><br/><p>She forgot all about her worries the moment she was reminded of Lu Tingxiao\u2019s coldness towards her.</p><br/><p>Guan\nRui patted his daughter\u2019s shoulder firmly. \"Go and prepare yourself!\nIt\u2019s our turn to show up soon! Call your Uncle and Aunty Lu too! Let\nthem see Ning Xi kill someone for themselves. Now, that would be\ninteresting\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Father!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Wang Shengzhe was\nterrified away by the devil, Ning Xi was finally alone. She picked up\nsome fish food and was stood by the pond, tossing the pellets in.</p><br/><p>A big school of red koi fish rushed over, fighting for the food.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly thought of the glutton Lu Jingli, so she snapped a picture of the fishes and sent it to him.</p><br/><p>As she was feeding the fishes happily, there was the sound of footsteps behind her suddenly.</p><br/><p>Ning\nXi thought that it was another guy trying to flirt with her. As she\nraised her head, she saw a strange and frail girl in a long, white\ndress.</p><br/><p>The girl had makeup on but it could not hide her pale and\nweak state. Ning Xi analyzed her longer, wanting to ascertain that she\ndid not know her. She was not sure why the girl was there, so she waited\nquietly to see what she wanted to do.</p><br/><p>The girl looked at Ning Xi\nlike she was trash and she smiled coldly. \"So, you\u2019re Ning Xi? Your face\nis thicker than the Great Wall! A cheap girl like you trying to get\ninto the Lu family?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Although this girl looked weak, her mouth was anything but.</p><br/><p>However, I'm sure that I don't know this girl... What's happening?</p><br/><p>Something's wrong... It smells fishy...</p><br/><p>As\nNing Xi was guessing the girl\u2019s intentions, the girl started uttering\nmore and more ridiculous words, \"Do you think you can hide the fact that\nyou\u2019re just a village girl by dressing like a model? You\u2019re just a\nlow-life. Who do you think you are?! You motherless thing!\"</p><br/><p>With that last sentence, Ning Xi squinted her eyes and emitted a lethal aura.</p><br/><p>The girl became more motivated when she saw Ning Xi\u2019s reaction, so she kept on provoking her.</p><br/><p>\"Who\ndoesn\u2019t know how complicated the entertainment industry is? You\u2019re just\nanother filthy slut! Stop acting innocent! You witch!\"</p><br/><p>The girl\nin the white dress did not expect Ning Xi to be able to suppress herself\nthis well and not get angry at her yet. She then splashed the glass of\nred wine she was holding onto Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s face and hair\nwere all dripping with wine. Her clothes were all drenched as well. She\nlooked like a mess and her eyes were filled with darkness\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

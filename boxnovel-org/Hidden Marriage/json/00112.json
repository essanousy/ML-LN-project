Oh my, my son is so handsome!\u201d Mrs. Lu was so moved that she didn\u2019t know who she should praise first.</p><br/><p>\u201cTingxiao, who chose those clothes for you and Little Treasure? Was it that young woman you like?\u201d At just one glance, Mrs. Lu noticed that those definitely did not conform to her son\u2019s style.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just knew you couldn\u2019t possibly have chosen this style of clothing! Look at how bright the colours are! How good-looking! It\u2019s nothing like the drab and boring clothing you wear all the time. You even made Little Treasure wear such drab and boring colours too! There\u2019s no doubt about it, your household really needs a woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWere the pictures also taken by her?\u201d Mr. Lu also couldn\u2019t resist asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Once again, Lu Tingxiao responded with a single word.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d Mr. Lu was clearly very pleased.</p><br/><p>Even as a child, Lu Tingxiao had hated getting his picture taken. Little Treasure hated getting his picture taken even more. Therefore, pictures of this father and son pair were extremely rare, and there were even fewer pictures of the two posing together. Acting in unison, both Mr. and Mrs. Lu silently saved the entire set of pictures.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, my future sister-in-law is unbelievable! She somehow managed to get you to wear clothing of this colour and had you obediently pose for pictures! I gave you a suit that was nearly identical to this one in colour and your expression was so disdainful. You even criticized my taste!\u201d This time, Lu Jingli was the one to speak.</p><br/><p>Since Lu Jingli had appeared, referring to the other party as \u2018my future sister-in-law\u2019, all the extended family members couldn\u2019t endure it any longer. Everyone began an interrogation to figure out which family the girl that Lu Tingxiao fancied belonged to.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao immediately responded with two words, \u201cPrivate matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>His meaning was, this is my private matter. No one is allowed to get involved.</p><br/><p>Therefore, those who were getting ready to investigate the situation no longer dared to act rashly.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stood at the helm of this large Lu family. His existence was akin to an emperor. The Lu family\u2019s glory and honour and the Lu family\u2019s respect and splendor were all dependent on him. Without a doubt, his words were like an imperial edict.</p><br/><p>At that moment, there was another person who had seen the pictures and chat messages in the family group chat: Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye stared unwaveringly at the words, \u201cWas it that young woman you like?\u201d After staring for a long time, he immediately sent Ning Xi a private message.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, did you take pictures for Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. How did you know? Did you see us?\u201d Ning Xi recalled that Jiang Muye also did not have any scenes to film today. She wondered to herself if this punk might have possibly snuck over again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, my uncle uploaded them to the family group chat to show off! Everyone is giving out compliments!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately became happy and typed rapidly, \u201cHahaha, really? Are they complimenting me for taking good pictures?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was so angry that he almost threw his phone, \u201cCould you focus on the main point here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should I be focusing on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, just now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye originally wanted to say that Lu Tingxiao had just personally admitted in the group chat that the girl he liked had taken the pictures for him. However, after thinking about how he had already told her that three times previously, he decided suddenly that this evidence wasn\u2019t strong enough. It was very likely he might even suffer another beating from her instead. Therefore, he decided that he might as well wait until he had found undeniable evidence that she could convince her completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have scenes together tomorrow. Don\u2019t be late!\u201d Jiang Muye changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen have I ever been late?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a kissing scene if everything goes according to plan. If there\u2019s any whiff of garlic or durian from you tomorrow, you\u2019re dead, got it?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Go away! I\u2019ll surely kill this bastard today!\" Zhuang Liaoyuan was totally blinded by his rage. \"I shouldn\u2019t have let you go the last time! And now you made your sister\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Why did he not kill this bastard last time!? Why!? Zhuang Liaoyuan drowned in his feelings of guilt. He blamed himself for how useless he was!</p><br/><p>If his wife came back, how could he be responsible for this? And his father\u2026</p><br/><p>He wanted to kill himself right away!</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer yelled loudly as she realized her father had gone berserk. \"Father! I\u2019m alright! I\u2019m okay! Nothing happened last night!\"</p><br/><p>Zhung Liaoyuan did not believe her. With his eyes wide, he roared, \"How could nothing have happened!? Why would he kneel in front of me now!? Go away, Keer!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m telling the truth, Father! It\u2019s true that I was almost violated by the bad guys last night, but then Xiao Xi came and saved both of us! We stayed for the night at Xiao Xi\u2019s place last night and only came back this morning! You can ask Xiao Xi if you don\u2019t believe me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Xi\u2026?\" Zhuang Liaoyuan was shocked.</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Father, the three druglords you discussed with your friends today was probably the three from last night! Xiao Xi killed one of them with a gun she took from them and another one passed out from fighting. As for the last one, his face was almost destroyed because when Xiao Xi reached the scene, she saw he was bullying me, so she beat him up really badly... It should be the three of them in the news\u2026\" Zhuang Keer explained to him as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan\u2019s uncontrollable anger cooled off a little. \"What you just said...is it true?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Father, if something really happened to me last night, would I still be here today?\" Zhuang Keer explained logically.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan\u2019s tensed up expression softened a little as he finally believed his daughter.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer then told his father about what happened last night in detail. She then asked worriedly, \"Father, will anything happen to Xiao Xi? She killed a person after all! I\u2019m really worried that she might be charged!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan replied coldly, \"What can happen? Even if something were to happen to her, I will ensure her safety!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer felt assured now. Xiao Xi would definitely be safe since her father gave her his word.</p><br/><p>Now, Zhuang Liaoyuan understood why the gang had lied and said they drank too much and fought among themselves. They wanted to save their face and not admit that a little girl had defeated them!</p><br/><p>As for the henchmen, they had probably gone along with the lie after they saw how powerful Ning Xi was last night.</p><br/><p>\"Get up! You should be grateful that your sister is okay. If not, I\u2019d have killed you no matter how regretful you feel!\" Zhuang Liaoyuan said coldly.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang covered his bleeding shoulder. With Zhuang Keer\u2019s help, he stood up slowly.</p><br/><p>\"So, this is why you suddenly changed?\" Zhuang Liaoyuan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang nodded. \"I want to be someone like Sis Xi\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"If you become a hundredth of her, I would be extremely grateful!\" Zhuang Liaoyuan sneered at him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

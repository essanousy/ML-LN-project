These are a few places I\u2019ve looked at. Here they are for your reference.\" Lu Tingxiao gave her a file folder.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s really quick!\" Ning Xi was amazed by the devil\u2019s efficiency.</p><br/><p>\"This doesn\u2019t take much time.\" She was always at the top of his priorities; of course, he would be quick.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much!\" Ning Xi felt at ease when she saw the file containing the analysis and comparisons of different areas.</p><br/><p>She then took a glance at the little bun and felt a little awkward. \"Uh...I\u2019m going out to look for houses today, so what can the little bun do? It\u2019s okay if I am going out for a short while, but I\u2019m going to a lot of places today and it\u2019ll be difficult for him to follow me!\"</p><br/><p>The little bun felt abandoned after he heard her plans.</p><br/><p>\"Let me call Butler Yuan over,\" Lu Tingxiao said.</p><br/><p>The little bun stared at his father and held Ning Xi\u2019s hand tightly. No!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hesitated. She would still feel bad even if someone was taking care of the little bun since she had to abandon him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao saw through her worries, then he put his phone down and said, \"Alternatively, I\u2019ll bring him to my office, then you can come over and pick him up after you\u2019re done.</p><br/><p>\"Mmm\u2026\" She would be much more comfortable if the little bun followed his father.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi then squatted down and told little bun gently, \"Little Treasure, I\u2019m really sorry that I\u2019m busy today. Do you want to wait here or would you like to go to the office with your father first?\"</p><br/><p>He did not want to choose. All he wanted was to stay with Aunty Xiao Xi! He was not afraid of being tired! But...he was afraid of troubling Aunty Xiao Xi...he was afraid that she would be exhausted looking after him\u2026</p><br/><p>The little bun struggled for a while, then he looked at his father reluctantly and decided to go to the office with his father.</p><br/><p>Then, he could create more chances for Father to be with Aunty Xiao Xi!</p><br/><p>He did not want to do this at all but, oh well, he could form an alliance with his father since he would need his father\u2019s help to be with Aunty Xiao Xi in the long run anyway.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was satisfied with his son\u2019s decision, it was as expected of his son!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not notice the exchange between them and she hugged the little bun tightly. \"You\u2019re really sweet today, I\u2019ll pick you up after I\u2019m done!\"</p><br/><p>After that, they went their separate ways.</p><br/><p>At the Lu Corporation office tower.</p><br/><p>As Lu Tingxiao held the little bun\u2019s hand and walked out of the car, everyone was surprised.</p><br/><p>All the limelight was focused on the little boy Lu Tingxiao had brought.</p><br/><p>Just by looking at his face, they instantly knew that this was none other than the legendary Little Master!</p><br/><p>It was even more obvious as they wore matching handsome outfits today and they attracted all the spotlight to themselves as if the sun was favoring them and shone directly on their path.</p><br/><p>The secretary at the receptionist table was really excited and sent a message to the office group chat.

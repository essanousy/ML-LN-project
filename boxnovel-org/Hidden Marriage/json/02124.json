She instantly thought about Yun Shen\u2019s mother, Yun Lan, and Lu Chongshan\u2019s personal grudges.</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026 that years ago, Yun Shen\u2019s mother and Lu Chongshan were actually related?</p><br/><p>Yun Shen\u2019s mother\u2019s fate was like Annie\u2019s. They had both been sent by the head of the Yun family\u2019s old clans, Yun Jie, to assassinate someone from the Lu family, but her target was Lu Chongshan!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fishy, you\u2019re much smarter than that silly woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen smiled faintly and looked towards Lu Tingxiao. \u201cThat silly woman gave herself, her heart, and even her life while you\u2026 You want everyone\u2019s lives!</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore this, I couldn\u2019t understand who the Yun family was detroyed by, and had even done so right before my eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt turns out that it was you! I\u2019m guessing it was also you who poisoned those people from the Lu family?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard this, Ning Xi finally understood.</p><br/><p>No wonder Yun Shen said that he recognized the poison.</p><br/><p>And the silly woman that Yun Shen was talking about was probably his mother, Yun Lan!</p><br/><p>Years ago, Yun Shen\u2019s mother had probably fallen for Lu Chongshan. Otherwise, she would not have given birth to Yun Shen.</p><br/><p>However, as the head of the Lu clan, and with the way Lu Chongshan would sacrifice anything for the clans\u2019 benefit, if he had found out about Yun Lan\u2019s identity\u2026</p><br/><p>You could already imagine the tragedy that came after.</p><br/><p>Annie did not deny a single thing. She only looked at Yun Shen with an exceptionally cold gaze. \u201cYou abandoned your conviction!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yun Shen heard her accusation, he immediately laughed out loud. \u201cHaha\u2026 conviction? What\u2019s my conviction? Like you, to kill off everyone who was related to that incident back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, he once shared the same thoughts as Annie even if he knew that his mother had at last died in the hands of his own grandfather, and was killed by his own clansmen because of shame.</p><br/><p>However, when he had finally gathered all the forces and wanted to take revenge, he realized that the Yun family had long been wiped out by someone overnight.</p><br/><p>From then on, killing Lu Chongshan and destroying the Lu family had become his only reason to live.</p><br/><p>Until\u2026</p><br/><p>Yun Shen\u2019s gaze fell a little dazedly onto the girl beside Lu Tingxiao\u2026</p><br/><p>It was only an instant before the man very quickly retrieved his gaze and looked towards Annie again. \u201cPreviously, you were by my side helping me. Because we had the same enemy, and now, I\u2019ve unexpectedly collaborated with my enemy, Lu Tingxiao, so you turned to Qiao Yi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang immediately revealed a shocked expression. \u201cCould it be that Qiao Yi was rescued by Annie?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Tang Ye, Feng Xiaoxiao, and the rest were all utterly puzzled when they heard this.</p><br/><p>They never would have thought that Little Treasure\u2019s matter back then would actually involve so much, including even the grudges and grievances of two generations.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen\u2019s mother and Lu Chongshan, Qiao Yi, Annie and Lu Tingxiao, Yun Qingze\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was suddenly an alarm that sounded from the ward.</p><br/><p>The nurse rushed out in panic. \u201cNot good! The patient just went into shock! I\u2019ll go get the doctor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure!\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s face was filled with dread. She immediately rushed into the ward with Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it! Let\u2019s just talk after getting the antidote!\u201d Tang Lang looked towards Annie with murderous intent. \u201cI don\u2019t care what your reason was. If you have any grudges then let\u2019s fight an open and honorable match. Using such a lowly trick and even troubing a child, are you even a man?!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Tang Lang said that, he realized that Annie was not a man, but he could not care much. He continued, \u201cHand over the antidote right now. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being cruel!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Annie heard, she chuckled. \u201cI wonder\u2026 How are you going to be cruel to me?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

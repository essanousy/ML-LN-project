Ning Xi had defeated the foreign lady with just one kick!</p><br/><p>\"I forgot to tell you that...I\u2019m a black belt,\" Ning Xi said calmly after she had rendered Alice unconscious.</p><br/><p>Looking back at what had just happened, Shi Xiao and Xiong Zhi were stunned speechless\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Ning Xi...\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a familiar voice cut through the silence.</p><br/><p>That voice\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao?!</p><br/><p>\"Boss!\" Ning Xi quickly ran over and examined him from head to toe and only after confirming that he was alright, she let out a sigh of relief, \"You\u2019re okay! That\u2019s great!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" At this moment Lu Tingxiao was furious beyond words, his body was burning up feverishly with rage and the anger was eating through his heart, \"Who allowed you to come here?!\"</p><br/><p>This was the first time that Ning Xi had ever seen Lu Tingxiao this angry and she was scared, \"Boss, you\u2019re...you\u2019re scary\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao clenched his teeth, \"You actually know what fear is?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put on a pitiful expression and said weakly, \"Of course I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m just a girl. I almost died just now! My legs are still shaking! Boss, don\u2019t yell at me anymore, I need some comfort...\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xiao and Xiong Zhi were totally speechless by this scene.</p><br/><p>Both of them were annoyed at Ning Xi. Just a moment ago, she was still acting all high and mighty! Which part of her looked afraid? Was she suffering from schizophrenia?</p><br/><p>The boss would never believe her!</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" When Lu Tingxiao saw the girl\u2019s panicked expression, he just restrained his inner rage and decided not to bother her with the issue anymore. He took a deep breath and pat the girl\u2019s head with his wide palms to comfort her, \"Don\u2019t be scared, I\u2019m here.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi let out a long sigh and secretly patted her chest as she had just skipped a major disaster. Boss was really scary when he was angry.</p><br/><p>She then continued weakly, \"Mmm...I\u2019m not scared anymore after I saw you, Boss! As long...as long as you don\u2019t yell at me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked apologetic, \"I\u2019m sorry, my bad, I won\u2019t do that ever again.\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xiao and Xiong Zhi were speechless again.</p><br/><p>What had just happened!?</p><br/><p>Who was this person?</p><br/><p>Was this their boss, Lu Tingxiao?</p><br/><p>Or was this not actually their boss, but was another trap set up by their enemy?</p><br/><p>The only one who was still relaxed about all this was Cheng Feng, who stood behind Lu Tingxiao. He pushed his glasses up his nose and looked at them with a face that seemed to scoff at them as young punks who did not know better.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

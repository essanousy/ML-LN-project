You've seen Xiao Xi Xi in every shape and form. In fact, you get to see her however you want, in whatever form, unlike those inexperienced punks!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Inside the changing room, Ye Ying brought out the outfit that had been prepared for Ning Xi, and there was also a makeup set ready.</p><br/><p>\"Bro Xi, do you need me to call the makeup artist over?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, it's fine. I'll do it myself,\" Ning Xi said as she took off her jacket, then unbuttoned her collar.</p><br/><p>Ye Ying's heart randomly skipped a beat. \"Well...well, then I'll go out first! Please change. Call me if you need anything!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\" Ning Xi nodded and unbuttoned the second button, revealing her fair collarbones and the indistinct trace of a white cloth binding her chest.</p><br/><p>Ye Ying quickly turned around and rushed out, even staggering and almost tripping on the way out.</p><br/><p>Outside the entrance, Jiang Muye's mouth twitched when he saw Ye Ying blushing. This punk, what did she do to this girl again?</p><br/><p>Actually, Ning Xi had really been innocent this time; she had not been extraordinarily nice or anything...</p><br/><p>Mm hmm, she really did not do anything!</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi was changing and putting on her makeup inside, the few of them outside started chatting as they waited.</p><br/><p>Qin Ran read through the script, \"Innocent...naive and adorable...and even obedient? This character is far too different from what Ning Xi really is. They must be joking!\"</p><br/><p>Han Yucheng agreed. Based on Ning Xi's image in a female outfit, she was practically on the level of the nation's queen!</p><br/><p>As for her in a male outfit, all of them had just experienced it, so there was no further explanation needed.</p><br/><p>Luo Fan was from Starlight Entertainment, and he had bumped into her quite a few times when she was still with Starlight, so he was not very curious about Ning Xi in her female look. Instead, he was chatting away with the Director.</p><br/><p>Li Lekai was staring at Mo Yuxiu, still apparently angry. However, he noticed that the guy was distracted, seeming impatient and absent-minded.</p><br/><p>Moments later, the door to the changing room opened from the inside. Everyone subconsciously looked up at the door.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of the changing room, a radiant, red-lipped beauty stepped out, her pair of clear eyes sparkling as her white off-shoulder dress hugged her figure intimately. Her hair fell beautifully on her shoulders, and she balanced confidently in pink stilettos. There was a simple yet refreshing vibe to her. She was incredibly breathtakingly beautiful.</p><br/><p>The girl's expression seemed introverted, serene, and shy. She looked extraordinarily innocent, lovely, and obedient, making one feel protective of her.</p><br/><p>\"Whoa!\" Qin Ran dropped the script onto the floor, his mouth gaping open.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye guffawed. She was tricking people again!</p><br/><p>Han Yucheng was dumbstruck. \"This...\"</p><br/><p>Li Lekai rubbed his eyes hard, and even Luo Fan was stunned as well...</p><br/><p>Mo Yuxiu immediately stood up and his gaze was fixed on the girl.</p><br/><p>\"Shoot! You're...you're really Ning Xi! Way cool! How did you do this? Could this be a different person?\" Qin Ran ran over and circled Ning Xi a few times in disbelief.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

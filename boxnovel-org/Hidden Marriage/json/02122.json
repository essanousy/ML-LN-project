It was an unconscious behavior that was drilled into them.</p><br/><p>They could actually feel the intense threat from the usually weak and gentle Annie!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the phone Annie was holding was already cracked. The screen had gone all dark.</p><br/><p>The girl gazed upon Lu Tingxiao with her animalistic eyes. \u201cThe new head of the Lu family sure isn\u2019t someone I should underestimate.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had actually done the impossible.</p><br/><p>She was confident that no one could see what was wrong with the footage, and that it would be impossible to recover.</p><br/><p>However, now her identity was revealed, and at such a time too.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Tang Lang were stunned to see Annie speaking with such a bold attitude.</p><br/><p>She\u2026 admitted it?</p><br/><p>The person in the video was really her!</p><br/><p>Yun Shen slowly walked out from behind Tang Lang. \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that my little fish would have so many secrets.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had tricked everyone.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi forced herself to come back to her senses. She used up every ounce of her strength to take a deep breath, then she asked the question she was most concerned about at the moment. \u201cAnnie, are you the one who poisoned Little Treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the girl admitted without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>All of them were stunned once again.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi realized that there was not much time left. She did not want to know about the whys and hows of it right now. She asked directly, \u201cWhat do I need to do for you to give me the antidote?\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie\u2019s expression was frigid. \u201cNing Xi, this has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi clenched her fists. \u201cHow can this have nothing to do with me!? I\u2019m Little Treasure\u2019s mother! You knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie had no expression on her face. \u201cThen, you should know well enough that this child should\u2019ve been dead long ago. I let him live until today and now I\u2019m just taking back what I gave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s body was trembling. No words could come out of her lips.</p><br/><p>It was true that Little Treasure had been announced dead by the doctor back then, therefore they put him into the morgue.</p><br/><p>Annie had probably brought Little Treasure\u2019s body away and revived him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saved Little Treasure back then, but why did you poison him?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already said that this matter has nothing to do with you,\u201d Annie repeated.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lu Tingxiao stepped up and said, \u201cSince you have a grudge against the Lu family, I\u2019m the head of the family clan. You can do whatever you want to me. Why hurt an innocent child?\u201d</p><br/><p>Given Annie\u2019s attitude, something had probably happened between her and the Lu family.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Annie\u2019s cold face suddenly had a slightly maniac smirk. \u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026 Innocent? Your son is innocent\u2026 but wasn\u2019t Bro Qingze innocent too? If I let him live, who\u2019s going to let my Bro Qingze go?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie\u2019s bloodlust spiked sharply with that last sentence.</p><br/><p>Bro Qingze\u2026</p><br/><p>All of them were wondering who that person was. Even Lu Tingxiao had not heard of this name before.</p><br/><p>Who was this Qingze she mentioned?</p><br/><p>Only Yun Shen reacted when he heard this name from Annie as if he recalled an old memory of his. He mumbled, \u201cQingze\u2026 Yun Qingze?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

He excused himself from Guan Ziyao and headed towards Ning Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Mo family\u2019s little garden was really pretty with had a pleasant view. The corner Ning Xi was sitting in had vines around it with flowers sprouting from it. Beside her was a pond reflecting the full moon.</p><br/><p>What was more beautiful than the view was the person under it.</p><br/><p>Yet, the person was only focused on Lu Tingxiao and Guan Ziyao.</p><br/><p>What were they talking about? It was taking really long! Damn it!</p><br/><p>Many young men or parents like Mo Jianzhang, who intended to look for a girl for their sons, all noticed Ning Xi. However, before they could make a move, they all saw the infamous flirt walking towards her.</p><br/><p>As they saw Wang Shengzhe in hunting mode, they hoped that this innocent-looking little girl would not be fooled by him!</p><br/><p>He actually came from a pretty prestigious family in Imperial. Although he was capable, he always indulged himself with lustful deeds.</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi was wondering what Lu Tingxiao and Guan Ziyao were talking about, a man had suddenly walked up to her. \"Hi there, is there anyone sitting here?\"</p><br/><p>The man wore a fitting English three-piece suit, looking rather retro and cool. His looks were above average, but his lustful eyes were a huge turn-off to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, no matter what the man did, it did not concern her, so Ning Xi kept on looking at Lu Tingxiao. Without looking at the man, she replied, \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe was a little taken aback but quickly smiled, \"You\u2019re really good at joking, I\u2019ve been watching you for a while. You seem to be here alone.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless at his nerve to ask something he already knew.</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe noticed that Ning Xi was not reacting to him but that got even more excited. His eyes were like a radar, scanning every inch of Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe was way more knowledgeable than women in girly stuff and he soon found a topic to approach her about. \"Is your dress from Spirit?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi reacted a little when she heard the brand name. \"Yes, why?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe got his chance and he beamed proudly before continuing with the topic, \"This is just a normal ready-made dress, isn't it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Correct.\" Ning Xi nodded and was waiting to see what he would say next.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m guessing you weren't able to get a custom-made piece? I heard that Spirit\u2019s list of custom-made dresses has a waiting line of 6 months now. It\u2019s really difficult to get one but I know someone on the inside. If you'd like, I can help you!\" Wang Shengzhe tried to make himself appeal to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled benovelently. \"No way! I didn\u2019t do anything to deserve that!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe's pride swelled when he felt that he had a chance. \"You\u2019re too humble, Miss. For a beauty like you, simply existing is hard work!\"</p><br/><p>He then scanned the girl\u2019s gentle eyes, her neat nose, cherry-like lips, and the gentle swell of her hips\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He could only guess that she was asking Lu Tingxiao to come back home.</p><br/><p>After hearing his brother\u2019s heartless reply, he shouted in his heart, \u201cNo way! Even Ning Xi had no effect after personally taking action! Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s my fate to die here? \u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s voice became even softer, \u201cBut I don\u2019t have the confidence to take Little Treasure out by myself. What if something unexpected happens? Little Treasure is definitely hoping for you to join us too! Come back, okay? Please?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stayed silent for three seconds, before replying, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll return home immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was dumbfounded for a moment. He suddenly felt like he had been enveloped in a brilliant light, as if he was going to ascend to heaven!</p><br/><p>Sister-in-law is indeed mighty and formidable!</p><br/><p>He just knew she could do it!</p><br/><p>He had thought that his brother wasn\u2019t going to budge, but it turns out that it was just a tsundere act!</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lu Tingxiao spoke two words, \u201cMeeting adjourned.\u201d</p><br/><p>All his subordinates looked at each other blankly, not daring to believe that they had been let off just like that!</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli proudly snorted. Everyone ought to thank me. I was the one who called our savior. You guys are all riding on my coattails!</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was surrounded right after the meeting ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Young Master! Did we hear wrongly just now? A woman actually called CEO Lu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was that calling? She was able to draw CEO Lu out of a meeting with a single phone call!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously! Does CEO Lu have someone by his side now? Which young heiress is she? Second Young Master, spill the beans!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli stared vigilantly at them, \u201cWhat are you all doing! Are you guys plotting something by asking me who she is? Trying to hug her leg? No way! Only I get to hug my future sister-in-law\u2019s leg! Don\u2019t even think about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u201d Couldn\u2019t they at least hug a toe?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In a corner within the movie city, Ning Xi ended the call, feeling as though a burden had lifted from her shoulders.</p><br/><p>The situation had finally been resolved\u2026</p><br/><p>There shouldn\u2019t be any more problems, right?</p><br/><p>This matter was obviously completely unrelated to her. She was really selfless!</p><br/><p>Just as she prepared to leave, her phone rang. It was Lu Jingli again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Young Master, what\u2019s wrong? Was that not enough?</p><br/><p>\u201cNonono, Little Xixi, your beauty trap was really too awesome! It solved the crisis perfectly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s face darkened. \u201cWhat beauty trap! I was clearly luring the tiger out of his den okay? Are you even familiar with your idioms!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh! I understand, I understand! Ok that\u2019s all. I\u2019m hanging up! I\u2019ll treat you to a meal next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi silently stared at the phone in her hand.</p><br/><p>What had that guy actually understood?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ning Xi, why are you hiding here? Let\u2019s go eat!\u201d Out of nowhere, Jiang Muye came looking for her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nervously glanced around in every direction. After confirming that no one had seen him looking for her, she relaxed. She leaned against the large red palace pillar with exhaustion and spoke, \u201cYou guys go ahead and eat. I\u2019m busy tonight so I won\u2019t be able to go anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jiang Muye\u2019s face immediately fell. \u201cThis is my welcome dinner and I\u2019m your love interest in the movie! You\u2019re not going to come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pinched the top of the bridge of her nose. \u201cI know I know, I\u2019m in the wrong. But I really do have something important going on today. Next time, I\u2019ll take you out on our own, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot okay!\u201d Jiang Muye wasn\u2019t persuaded at all. He fiercely looked her up and down. \u201cWhat important business do you have? Who are you meeting with tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi heard his words and her tone turned serious, \u201cI believe that whoever I meet with isn\u2019t any of your business?\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, Jiang Muye\u2019s expression immediately turned unsightly, \u201cYou\u2019re going to see Lu Tingxiao, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

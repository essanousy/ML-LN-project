To encounter such a weirdo!</p><br/><p>However, what he did not know was that, there is worse to come\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly remembered something, slapped her own forehead, then reminded the woman: \u201cAh right, I\u2019ll send you the recording of the conversation he had with his dog buddies when I head back, to prove that he had an affair!</p><br/><p>Why the hell should he not give a penny after divorce? Is your skull broken? Take whatever should be taken and not a penny less! Are you listening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY\u2026\u2026yes ma\u2019am!\u201d The woman was dumbfounded by Ning Xi\u2019s aura, and subconsciously replied.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded with satisfaction, then earnestly said, \u201cEn, it should be like this, once you have money, whatever type of man you want, there will be, even if there are no sincere ones, at least you are able to raise a few obedient and handsome toy boys! And if they defy you, you can replace them anytime! How good is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The women: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The scumbag: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli, who was not far away: \u201c\u2026\u2026!!!\u201d He actually felt that sister-in-law made a lot of sense\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Over the phone, the woman was full of doubts, so she could not help but asked: \u201cThank you! But, who\u2026\u2026who are you? Why are you helping me? Do I know you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi look at the camera, and smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, you can just call me Lei Feng!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up the call, she kicked away the scumbag, and swaggered off\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli jaw dropped, \u201cBrother, there are something that shouldn\u2019t be said, but I could not help it\u2026\u2026 Sister-in-law is way too handsome ah ah ah ah! I am almost in\u2026\u2026\u201d love with her!</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao did have the energy pay attention to the excited Lu Jingli. He tiredly pinched the space between his eyebrows. He had an expression of a person who had just survived a disaster.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli, with a face full of admiration, looked at his biological brother, \u201cBrother is still the wisest, if you did not hold back, we could not have seen such a wonderful scene!\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, Lu Jingli had an expression full of thoughts, excitedly said, \u201cSpeaking of which, I suddenly remembered something. All of the people Ning Xi dated back then, even though I only have the list of some people, but all those people are scumbags, and are all dumped by Ning Xi eventually, including Jiang Muye. If you link that to the fact that Jiang Muye is always avoiding the topic of the time when he was dating Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Say, when Ning Xi dated all those scumbags, was it the same situation as today? Bait then punish them, carrying out heaven\u2019s, protecting love and justice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Lu Jingli\u2019s tone of having a major discovery, Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s face did not have the slightest fluctuation.</p><br/><p>He has never believed that she was that kind of person.</p><br/><p>Even if it was real, it does not matter.</p><br/><p>After taking care of the scumbag, Ning Xi was humming while riding her bike, feeling refreshed and she was in a good spirit.</p><br/><p>Indeed, abusing scumbags is the most effective way to reduce stress!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the time on her phone, it was only four o\u2019clock in the morning, it was still too early, she needed to wait until at least six o\u2019clock before she can head home.</p><br/><p>Because that is the timing where she can encounter Lu Ting Xiao in the living room\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>And so, after thinking for a moment, Ning Xi turned by the bend and headed to the west side of the city.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, she reached a riverbank.</p><br/><p>After parking her bike, she walked towards the soft grass and sat down.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile she could relax in the wind and get sobered up\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Also, there is another advantage to this place, which is\u2026\u2026 there are a lot of mosquitoes!</p><br/><p>After lying down, she murmured to herself, \u201cMosquitoes! Ah mosquitoes! It is time for your meal, come and bite me quickly\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

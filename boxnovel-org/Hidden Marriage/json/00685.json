He looked at the cup of coffee on the table and scowled. \"You\u2019ve not fully recovered yet. Don\u2019t stay up anymore and go to sleep now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? But after what just happened, my brain is too excited now. I can\u2019t sleep anytime soon!\" Ning Xi mumbled.</p><br/><p>Her eyes shone as she suddenly thought of something. \"Ah! Let\u2019s do something meaningful in the dead of tonight!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at her with a hooded gaze and asked in a slightly hoarse voice, \"Like what?\"</p><br/><p>After a while\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Ahh...no!\" Ning Xi\u2019s screams broke the silence of the still night\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at the ghost moaning and listened to the scary background music as his face darkened.</p><br/><p>Her so-called \"meaningful\" activity was to watch a horror movie?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrunk into the sheets, only her small head popping out and her face was pale. She let out the occasional scream. \"Ah...the wardrobe! There\u2019s a ghost in the wardrobe...don\u2019t open it!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was speechless at her behavior. \"Why are you still watching it if you\u2019re so scared?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is exciting! I always watch a lot of movies, just not horror films! Because...I\u2019m afraid of ghosts\u2026\" Ning Xi said sadly.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised his eyebrows in surprise. It was rare that she was afraid of something.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s why I never watch it alone. Since you\u2019re here today, of course, I\u2019m going to grab this chance!\" Ning Xi said with enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao patted her head. \"I\u2019ll accompany you whenever you want.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded, looking at Lu Tingxiao. She thought that she would not get used to having someone by her side after being single for so long. But now, as she was watching the horror film, wrapped up in the sheets while Lu Tingxiao just sat there with her, she felt that being with someone else was not so bad after all\u2026</p><br/><p>Probably due to the devil's imposing aura, the fright level of the film was toned down and she even fell asleep halfway\u2026</p><br/><p>When he saw that she had fallen asleep, Lu Tingxiao turned off the television and covered her with sheets gently.</p><br/><p>As he stood up, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Incoming call: Mo Lingtian.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s gentle eyes turned icy as he took the call on the balcony.</p><br/><p>\"Hello.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Lu Tingxiao.\" Mo Lingtian sounded as if he had just been tortured.</p><br/><p>\"How\u2019s the investigation going?\" Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve gone through a lot of hard times for Tang Lang! But...that man...I\u2019m sorry...I was just a step away! I could almost expose his true identity but for some reason, he got ahold of my investigating him and he destroyed all my leads! I really don\u2019t know what to do now! Stop asking me to do this! I can\u2019t do it anymore!\"</p><br/><p>\"The land in Chengdong District.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll work on that! Even if I have to sacrifice my life, I\u2019ll help you to find him!\" Mo Lingtian perked up at this lead and his vigor was renewed.</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\"</p><br/><p>As Lu Tingxiao was about to end the call, Mo Lingtian added, \"Wait...although I failed, I found some other interesting news.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"Satan got desperate because of what you did. He started to wipe out everything but he might return with a different identity. Be careful.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What was she supposed to do? She had even given him something to eat, so what was he trying to do?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stopped eating and walked over to him, \"Hey, why do you keep staring at me?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not staring at you.\" Ning Xi was surprised that he replied in Chinese. She did not expect him to be a Chinese\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi responded in Chinese as well, \"You\u2019ve been staring at me since just now! Even at this moment!\"</p><br/><p>The beggar scanned her then replied, \"I\u2019m looking at your outfit.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at her dress and asked, \"What about my outfit?\"</p><br/><p>The beggar did not even hesitate. \"It\u2019s ugly.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless. Even people who had zero fashion sense would never consider this dress as ugly.</p><br/><p>\"Why don't you tell me which part of this dress is ugly?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was not expecting anything constructive but his reply was out of her expectations, \"The embroidery on your dress is a flower-bird themed which comes from the drawing called \"Rest\" by Lin Fengmian. It\u2019s a good drawing but the background color is too dark. It\u2019d be better if turquoise blue was used. They shouldn't have used silk as well; a softer fabric would have worked better. The worst part is the design around the waist. It\u2019s a misconception that the tighter the waist area, the more can one flaunt their curves. Actually, if it\u2019s a little bit looser, it would have made an enormous difference\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi saw that the beggar commented excitedly about her outfit.</p><br/><p>She looked at her outfit again and armed with the knowledge from his comments, she thought that his words made sense.</p><br/><p>She listened patiently and prompted, \"Tell me more!\"</p><br/><p>The beggar continued with a cold tone, \"Most importantly, this outfit you\u2019re wearing is a half-made draft! They are deceiving the consumers by putting this on for sale!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the beggar again. \"How do you know all these?\"</p><br/><p>The beggar had really messy hair that covered most of his face but from his voice, Ning Xi was determined that he should be around 20 odd years of age.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt something was off, this man was young and did not seem to be disabled either, so how did he end up as a beggar on the streets of this foreign country?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She applied some light makeup and straightened her natural curls, letting them cascade over her shoulders. As usual, she placed that pink heart shaped hair clip on her head. In short, she looked exactly like a good wife.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was sitting on the sofa and reading the newspaper. His expression momentarily went blank when he saw her, \u201cYour outfit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If she didn\u2019t have to attend any special events, Ning Xi was usually dressed in a very simple and casual style. This was his first time seeing her dressing this\u2026 girly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was bouncing with excitement in front of him, \u201cHow is it? How is it? Don\u2019t I look like someone\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he looked at her, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes held a deeper meaning, \u201cVery much so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone\u2019s wife.</p><br/><p>Those two words were extremely beautiful to his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, that\u2019s good! I won\u2019t get cheated if I go to the market looking like this!\u201d Ning Xi nodded her head with satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019m heading off now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she tried to take a step, she found that she couldn\u2019t move her leg.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was clinging to her leg.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry when she looked at her new \u2018leg accessory\u2019, \u201cDarling! Why are you up this early?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure rubbed his sleepy eyes and stretched out his arms to show that he wanted a hug.</p><br/><p>With that appearance, Ning Xi couldn\u2019t resist picking him up, \u201cI\u2019m just going out to buy some groceries. I\u2019ll be back very soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure continued clinging stubbornly to her neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we go along with you?\u201d At that moment, Lu Tingxiao asked from the sidelines.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked, \u201cEh, you guys want to go too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can take Little Treasure out for a walk.\u201d Lu Tingxiao suggested.</p><br/><p>From the side, Little Treasure nodded with all his might.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head, \u201cOf course you can! It\u2019s just that the wet market might be a little dirty! The place I\u2019m going to isn\u2019t a supermarket. It\u2019s a big marketplace that\u2019s a little farther away. The food there is the freshest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Lu Tingxiao put down his newspaper and picked up the car keys.</p><br/><p>Just like this, Ning Xi\u2019s solo trip became a three person trip with a little bun and a big bun.</p><br/><p>In the underground garage.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had to swallow her drool as she looked at the row of dazzling luxury cars, especially when she saw her dream man \u2018Little White\u2019.</p><br/><p>When he saw that Ning Xi had her eyes fixed on the white Bugatti sports car, Lu Tingxiao asked, \u201cShall we drive this one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi regained her senses and quickly shook her head, \u201cOf course not! We\u2019re just going to the wet market. Driving a sports car would be way too excessive! Do you have a car that\u2019s more low-key?\u201d</p><br/><p>She glanced around the garage and found that there really wasn\u2019t one\u2026</p><br/><p>How could that be\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Lu Tingxiao nodded his head, \u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he pressed a button somewhere and a black car was transported over from another partition.</p><br/><p>It was a sedan that cost about \u200e500,000 yuan, and it looked completely new.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded excitedly in approval when she saw it, \u201cThis car is awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, why did Lu Tingxiao have a car that looked so out of place here?</p><br/><p>As if he knew what she was thinking, he explained, \u201cThis was prepared for you when you first came. You\u2019ve just never driven it before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d So this was the sedan that Lu Tingxiao had prepared for her back then.</p><br/><p>Seeing Lu Tingxiao\u2019s slightly despondent expression, Ning Xi felt as though she had committed a huge mistake and rushed to explain, \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s usually more convenient for me to take the subway, I can even avoid traffic!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, she quickly changed the topic, \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and go. If we wait any longer, the good stuff will be taken away! If that happens, my performance will be affected!\u201d</p><br/><p>TL Note: 500,000 yuan = ~USD72,400</p><br/><p>Wet markets are a type of market common in China, Hong Kong and Singapore~</p><br/><p>It\u2019s generally messy, dirty and\u2026 you guessed it, wet. Not exactly the kind of place you\u2019d want to bring Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure!</p><br/><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_market</p><br/><p>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-czgDK7p_G9Q/UZz1T0kaIZI/AAAAAAAAEOM/qGVYsuXTxLc/s1600/ChiangMai+553r1.JPG</p><br/><p>A white Bugatti sports car\u2026</p><br/><p>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/6c/bd/93/6cbd936daa94ba5e51eff81a06b836ef.jpg</p><br/>\n</div>"}

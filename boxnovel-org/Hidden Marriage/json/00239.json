Not only that, many of the previously signed brand representation companies are requesting compensation. Starlight is also requesting for Ning Xuelo to keep a lower profile until this matter passes by.</p><br/><p>Other than Ning Xuelo, no one else under her is re-presentable, which means that for the next half a year she will have to go on an empty stomach!</p><br/><p>Chang Li replied in a surly tone saying, \u201cI\u2019m only here to inform you, move out immediately! You have already turned your back on the company and broke off the contract. Don\u2019t tell me you still want to occupy the company\u2019s apartment? That apartment can at least be rented out for 1000+ yuan per month!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ha, in the city, just 1000+ yuan monthly rent is also worth bragging?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi does not have the time to deal with her nonsense, so she casually said, \u201cNoted, if there\u2019s nothing else I\u2019ll be hanging up\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could hang up the phone, Chang Li began to aggressively blame her, \u201cNing Xi, ask your own conscience, didn\u2019t the company treat you well? Nowadays which company will still give unpopular newbies accommodation? How many small artists can\u2019t get work? At least you got to do work!</p><br/><p>The company initially wanted to give it\u2019s all to popularize you! Even if you were to meet any kind of problem, the company will never give up on you! Whereas you\u2026\u2026 you forgot your roots when you succeeded, and even back-stabbed the company when you climbed higher!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi clicked her tongue and said, \u201cAgent Chang you are really good at twisting truth and lies! If you make so much sense, why don\u2019t you go onto the internet and let them know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Li immediately choked. Previously, she did go onto the internet and said those words, but the end the result was being scolded badly by the netizens\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Chang Li gave an unwilling snort, and coldly said, \u201cGolden Age Entertainment gathers all the big-shots, the competition is fiercer than Starlight. You think that you can hop company\u2019s, go over there, and they will give you opportunities to shine? That\u2019s ridiculous, you\u2019re only a pawn used by Golden Age to affect Starlight! You think that Golden Age really sees you as important? Don\u2019t come crying to me when they don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPa-\u201c the phone got hung up furiously.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged, and looked at Lu Ting Xiao standing beside her, \u201cI have something to do today. Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, Chang Li called and said the apartment that Starlight assigned to me will be taken back. I still have things over there so, I need to go and move out!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

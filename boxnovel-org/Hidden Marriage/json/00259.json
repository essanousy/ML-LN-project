The mood was so heavy and depressing! Doctor Sun! My Doctor Sun is actually dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2019s acting is simply too formidable! So compelling! I now know that those previously released tidbits were but a drop in the bucket! And I finally understand why Guo Qisheng insisted on using her against all odds!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Ning Xi the main female lead? Compared to that mouthful of virtue and morality Shangguan Ying Rong, Meng Chengge\u2019s role has much more depth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the backstage dressing room, after removing her makeup, Ning Xi\u2019s expression of pain and chill have yet to fade. Standing on one side, Xiao Tao, who was waiting to give her her meal, did not dare to disturb her.</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Muye pushed the door open and walked in. He, who had become inured to the unusual, said, \u201cJust put it down. Don\u2019t worry about her. She will be alright in awhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Xiao Tao put down the lunch, and hurried out. The look Ning Xi had just now was quite horrifying, as if she was possessed.</p><br/><p>About five minutes later, Ning Xi lifted her possessed state, cleverly waking up.</p><br/><p>Stretching lazily, she twisted her neck and complained. \u201cDamn! I got too deep into my character this time, I almost couldn\u2019t come out of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye stared at her, his eyes narrowed, \u201cJust be contented with it already. If people acted at your level, it will take them at least a few months to come out of their characters! Some even go into madness! You took less than even an hour, what more do you want? You beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he was in a \u2018dead\u2019 state during the act just now, so he did not know how well Ning Xi acted. He specially went to look at the playback of the scene, and hell, it was simply too astounding!</p><br/><p>He even felt that Ning Xi\u2019s feelings were so deep, that even if the seas go dry and rocks crumble, her love will remain firm!</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, where\u2019s my Sister Zhizhi? I haven\u2019t ask Sister Zhizhi for her evaluation of my act!\u201d Ning Xi asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>Right after she spoke, Sister Zhizhi pushed the door open. Looking at the time on her watch, with a hurried expression, she said, \u201cNing Xi, I will be heading to my the office in the afternoon, are you alright alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? You\u2019re leaving already?\u201d Ning Xi was a little depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I am not needed here anymore.\u201d Lin Zhizhi said, revealing a rare smile.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi heard that, her spirits got lifted up immediately. That sentence was undoubtedly the biggest affirmation of trust in her!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead, go ahead! I will be alright alone, and I will be well-behaved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, contact me anytime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkie dokie, I\u2019ll let you go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After sending Lin Zhizhi off, Ning Xi happily hopped back. Jiang Muye gave her a look of disdain, \u201cLook at your toady behaviour!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi returned him a look of disdain too, \u201cHmph, you are just jealous of my good relationship with Sister Zhizhi! Speaking of which, I should be thanking you. After experiencing a scumbag like you, she would then cherish an obedient darling like me more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye coldly laughed. He had an expression of \u2018you are simply too naive\u2019. \u201cContinue being pleased with yourself then! You will definitely face hardship in the future! You think that woman can be messed around with? Don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you when you become tormented until you cry for your dad and shout for your mom.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

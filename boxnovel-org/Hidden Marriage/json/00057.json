My skin is quite sensitive, I might have an allergic reaction if I use other brands\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, that\u2019s not how we do things here. If it turns out badly, are you going to take responsibility? Weren\u2019t you just fine yesterday?\u201d Amy\u2019s expression was full of impatience, clearly thinking that she was way too busy to entertain such requests.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi brought out a red packet from her bag and stealthily placed it into Amy\u2019s palm, \u201cAmy-jie, please accomodate me\u2026 since actors depend on our faces to work, I\u2019m just taking precautions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Amy felt the thickness of the red packet and coughed lightly. With an act of reluctance, she said, \u201cFine! But if there are any problems, you\u2019ll have to tell the director that you\u2019re taking responsibility!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! It won\u2019t affect Amy-jie!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no eternal enemies in this industry. After receiving a huge bonus, Amy was much happier and took extra care when applying makeup for Ning Xi. It even turned out better than yesterday\u2019s.</p><br/><p>When the makeup artist left, Ning Xi crossed her arms and examined the costume for today. She then took out a large magnet from her bag and carefully swept it over the costume like she was conducting a safety inspection. After doing so, she did the same to her shoes.</p><br/><p>Good, there weren\u2019t any problems.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi kept the magnet and stuck out her tongue. She thought to herself, how unprofessional! There should be a needle sewn into the clothes, which would stab until you hurt everywhere. You wouldn\u2019t even be able to find where the problem was. A small thumbtack should have been embedded in the sole of the shoes. There wouldn\u2019t be any problems while walking on even ground, but once they had to move vigorously, then there would be that aggrieved feeling\u2026</p><br/><p>Compared to Ning Xueluo, who had been protected in cotton, Ning Xi had been crawling about the lower levels of the industry for so many years. She had already seen all the tricks in the book, how would she be unable to see through such small tricks?</p><br/><p>Although she had no way to test the makeup products, but Ning Xueluo knew that Ning Xi\u2019s skin was sensitive to metals, so there was an 80% chance that she would do something along those lines.</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi was done changing, the dance instructor that the director had hired was already waiting outside. While other people were filming their scenes, Ning Xi followed behind the instructor and learned the movements for the dance.</p><br/><p>When they were done filming on the other side, the director walked over to check the results, \u201cNing Xi, how did it go? I saw on your profile that you\u2019ve learned dance before, so I think half the day should be more than enough. If it\u2019s not, then I can give you a few more days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any problems\u2026\u201d Ning Xi didn\u2019t want to over promise on things.</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng looked towards the dance instructor, \u201cTeacher Zheng, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dance instructor chuckled and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll see for yourself later!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s start now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Scene 13: Consort De\u2019s Drunken Dance.</p><br/><p>Characters: The Emperor, Consort De, Consort Xian, various concubines, eunuchs and servants.</p><br/><p>They had just finished the Grand Selection, and a new batch of fresh young girls had come in. The emperor had called a bevy of concubines and consorts to his resting palace for drinks and entertainment.</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s heart was on the new girls, and even the most favoured Consort De had been left to one side.</p><br/><p>The most favoured consort before Consort De had come was Consort Xian. Upon seeing that Consort De had also been abandoned, Consort Xian was filled with joy at her misfortune, \u201cIn this palace, it has always been \u2018the new people smile and the old people cry\u2019, did she think that she had enough beauty to keep the emperor\u2019s heart to herself for his entire life? This consort wants to see if she can continue being so pleased with herself for a few more days!\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s most likely because Consort De was played by Ning Xi, Jia Qingqing, who normally had average acting skills, actually played her part skilfully. Seeing this, the director was very pleased.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

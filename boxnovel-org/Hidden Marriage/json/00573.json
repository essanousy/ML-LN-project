This is too much! If you insist on doing such a thing, you'll get hurt in the end! They won\u2019t let you off easily if you affect the amount of benefits they get!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sneered, \"Ah...their benefits...whose benefits?\"</p><br/><p>He always acted as if he cared but changed his stand the minute his benefits were involved.</p><br/><p>Su Yan saw Ning Xi\u2019s incensed eyes and he quickly explained himself, \"You\u2019ve misunderstood me, Xiao Xi. I\u2019m not doing this for myself, I\u2019m not after the Ning family\u2019s wealth either. It\u2019s just that...I don\u2019t know what to do if you\u2019re in conflict with Xueluo!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stretched her back and glanced at him sideways. \"What\u2019s the matter? Do you have any other choice aside from Ning Xueluo when it comes to choosing between us?\"</p><br/><p>Su Yan balled his fist tightly when he saw the girl smirk and the mocking disdain in her eyes...</p><br/><p>He calmed himself down after a while, sighed and tried to avoid the girl\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>There would not have been any other choice if time were reversed. Even if he had another chance to choose what happened five years ago once again, he would still have chosen Ning Xueluo without any hesitation. Regardless of Ning Xueluo\u2019s mistake, he loved her to the point of selfishness and he chose to protect her to the ends of the Earth.</p><br/><p>But now\u2026</p><br/><p>He himself was not sure what was wrong with him. Ever since Ning Xi had come back, his sight always lingered on her and his urges to be near her were getting stronger lately...</p><br/><p>He had always known what he wanted. Ning Xueluo was the woman of his dreams, his perfect ideal partner.</p><br/><p>However, for some reason, what he thought he had known all along was falling apart\u2026</p><br/><p>He should not have come looking for Ning Xi this late at night to avoid any misunderstanding, but he still came.</p><br/><p>All because he wanted to see her, even if she wanted to be sarcastic with him!</p><br/><p>Su Yan calmed his turmoiled heart and started talking in a gentle tone, \"Xiao Xi, I\u2019m telling you this for you own good. I hope that you can think about it. Give me a call if you ever need help with anything.\"</p><br/><p>As he was still trying to convey his message discretely, he realized that he did not know what more to say at that point. \"I\u2019ll not bother you now, it\u2019s late already. Goodnight.\"</p><br/><p>From around the corner, Lu Jingli\u2019s eyes recorded everything that was happening and he spoke quietly, \"Hmm, my sixth sense is picking up an unusual aura! It seems like...the way Su Yan is looking at Ning Xi is a little suspicious.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lu Tingxiao released the pressure he had been suppressing all night long with a loud whoosh of air.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was terrified as he wiped his sweat and mumbled to himself,\"What situation am I in now? Bro, did you meddle with something weird lately? You\u2019re really unlucky with so many romantic rivals around...and for some reason, I\u2019ve been feeling that something big is going to happen soon! I\u2019m scared\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

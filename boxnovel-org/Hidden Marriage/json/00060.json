If she reacted too drastically, then it would seem like she was imagining feelings when there weren\u2019t any.</p><br/><p>Thus, when Ning Xi heard this very ordinary question, she answered it in a normal manner: \u201cMale!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s unfathomable gaze narrowed imperceptibly, \u201cAre you coming back tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>These questions\u2026 were getting more and more\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi used her acting skills and pretended not to have noticed the hidden meaning of the question, she replied nonchalantly, \u201cI\u2019m not too sure yet, I\u2019ll give you a call then! It\u2019s almost time for me to go, I\u2019m going upstairs first!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were definitely going to be some unexpected situations popping up later. What if she couldn\u2019t hold back and beat up that kid, Jiang Muye, for the whole night?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hurriedly grabbed a large, black duffel bag from upstairs, then hugged and kissed the little bun goodbye.</p><br/><p>Watching the girl practically fly off, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face was like snow in August.</p><br/><p>Other than Ning Xi, the little bun was completely uninterested in anything else, including his own daddy. However, upon seeing his daddy trying to suppress the gloominess in his expression, he bent his head to write something on his notepad, then reached out to poke him with a tiny finger.</p><br/><p>Feeling the small pressure on his arm, Lu Tingxiao lowered his gaze and saw the question mark that his son had written on his notepad.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me why I\u2019m unhappy?\u201d Lu Tingxiao raised a brow, then paused in deep thought for a moment. He finally spoke up faintly, \u201cIf your Auntie Xiao Xi becomes someone else\u2019s someday\u2026 If she calls someone else darling, kisses someone else good morning, good night and goodbye, eats hotpot with someone else\u2026 and you\u2019re no longer anyone to her, without even the right to question her or get angry with her\u2026 would you be happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was dazed for a moment before his expression instantly changed to one that looked as if the sky had fallen.</p><br/><p>Thus, a certain daddy became a little calmer.</p><br/><p>With tears trickling down his cheeks, Little Treasure snatched away his heartless daddy\u2019s phone and complained to Auntie Xiao Xi.</p><br/><p>He sent a crying emoji to Ning Xi: (&gt;?&lt;?)?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi, who was hurrying to the airport, thought that the little bun was upset because they weren\u2019t going to eat hotpot. She immediately gathered a bunch of sweet words to console the little bun: Aiyah, darling, what happened? You\u2019re not happy? Don\u2019t be upset, if you\u2019re sad, then auntie will be sad too! Auntie really has something to do today, I\u2019ll definitely accompany you to eat hotpot tomorrow, okay? Xoxo! I\u2019ll love you for a thousand years! I love darling\u2019s smile the most!</p><br/><p>Little Treasure looked at Ning Xi\u2019s reply, and his tears turned into smiles. He even proudly showed the phone to his daddy.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao glanced at the sweet words Ning Xi had sent, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt like he had been stabbed in the heart\u2026</p><br/><p>Two hours later, at Beijing Airport.</p><br/><p>Although Ning Xi had already been prepared before she had come, she was still scared silly by the scene before her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHHH! Jiang Muye! Jiang Muye! Jiang Muye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHubbie look over here! Hubbie I love you! Hubbie I want to give birth to your kids!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMuye, Muye, you\u2019re the coolest! Yezi will always support you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Teenage girls were the most numerous amongst the fans, she even saw some middle-aged women and quite a few male fans. They were all shouting at the top of their lungs. All the security guards at the airport had been deployed, but they still weren\u2019t able to control the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear wives, could you keep it quiet? Don\u2019t disturb others! Shhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sexy voice sounded from the crowd, and all the fans suddenly went silent, before they burst out into screams that almost burst through the roof. The scene had not calmed down at all, but turned even more lively.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hid behind a pillar and looked on from afar, her head full of sweat drops.</p><br/><p>This guy deserved to get cut up by a thousand knives, he was definitely out to kill her!</p><br/><p>If she went out to pick him up at this time, could she even live past tonight?</p><br/><p>Luckily she came prepared\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She only needs herself and doesn\u2019t need to rely on anyone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the bunch was happily gossiping, someone suddenly yelled in the direction of the entrance, \u201cBro Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Goddess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone called Ning Xi \u201cLady Boss\u201d, then everyone else followed after that.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt funny about how hyped up they were. She smiled and greeted everyone, then she went upstairs to meet Xu Tao.</p><br/><p>As she was about to walk up, there were sounds of hurried footsteps behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s Big Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA real living Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, all the working staff stared behind her and screamed. Ning Xi turned around and saw that it was Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, what\u2019s up?\u201d Ning Xi looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cScarf.\u201d Lu Tingxiao had a lamb-wool scarf in his hand. He gently wrapped it around her neck.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi touched the warm scarf. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. There\u2019s air conditioning in the office.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao then took a carefully-packaged meal box from Cheng Feng.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly accepted it. \u201cOh, I forgot about this! I\u2019ve been quite sleepy recently. My brain power is running low!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao frowned. \u201cDo you still remember how to take medicine and nutritional supplements?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one more time\u2026\u201d As Lu Tingxiao was about to tell her, he stopped and pinched between his eyebrows. \u201cForget about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at Cheng Feng and instructed, \u201cDelay the meeting today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? But, Boss, it\u2019s been delayed once already\u2026\u201d Cheng Feng\u2019s eyes met with the sharp eyes of his boss, then he changed his tone. \u201cI got it! I\u2019ll let them know now!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was nothing more important than the Lady Boss now. Even if the company was going down, the Boss probably would not even bat an eyelid.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was worried when she heard Lu Tingxiao delaying his meeting. \u201cYou can go back to work. I\u2019ll be fine on my own, really!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChange the date for the observation this afternoon too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>In the end, Lu Tingxiao postponed all the work he had that day and followed Ning Xi upstairs.</p><br/><p>At this moment, all the working staff at Glory World Entertainment gushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so done!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can take their affection anytime!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Boss is really crazy when protecting his wife! I want to rant on Weibo! Where\u2019s the Protection Society for Single People!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, darling, I think Bro Tao would be scared if you follow me!\u201d Ning Xi mumbled before entering Xu Tao\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi expected, after they pushed the door open and when Xu Tao saw the Big Boss, he almost wet himself.</p><br/><p>He felt guilty after all! He had said so many bad things about the Boss yesterday!</p><br/><p>\u201cB-boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi made Lu Tingxiao sit down on the sofa nearby while she sat in front of Xu Tao\u2019s table. \u201cBro Tao, just ignore him. We\u2019ll talk about the leftover work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before her wedding, she had to finish some jobs.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xu Tao was on the verge of crying!</p><br/><p>The Boss had such a looming presence that it was impossible to ignore him.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao eased up slightly when Lu Tingxiao was not noticing him and just talked to the assistant. He started arranging some of the leftover work for Ning Xi at this stage.</p></div>\n</div>"}

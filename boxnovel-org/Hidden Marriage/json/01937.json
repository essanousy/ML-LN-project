You\u2019re not human! Ning Xiao Xi, our friendship ends here!\u201d Jiang Muye was fuming.</p><br/><p>This witch had done it on purpose! Just to show her affection, she had sold him out!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was sitting in front of the dressing table. She glanced back at Jiang Muye as she took her earrings off. \u201cI said I\u2019m letting you take the female category, but, no, you didn\u2019t want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>She then started studying a certain blondie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s facial features were rather pretty. If he put on makeup and a female outfit\u2026</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye could not stand Ning Xi\u2019s staring anymore. \u201cScrew you! Ning Xiao Xi, I\u2019m going to kill you if you think about that again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed out of regret.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Ning Xi looked at the door.</p><br/><p>She was surprised to see who it was.</p><br/><p>The person was wearing a full black tuxedo with a special-looking flower in his hands.</p><br/><p>The flowers were light pink in color and looked like a ruffled collar from the mid-European era. It seemed like a special rare flower from a botanical garden in Japan.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Li Muyan handed the flowers over like a gentleman.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly stood up and took the flowers. \u201cThank you, Mr. Li\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was nearby tonight with the diplomat from Japan. I saw the live stream and found out that you had an important event tonight. I hope my uninvited visit isn\u2019t troubling you,\u201d Li Muyan explained his intention of being there briefly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled politely. \u201cOf course not, you\u2019re welcome here! I really like the flowers. Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>This flower had a special scent and it smelled a little like pears with the gentleness of summer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are magnolias from Japan. Because I only found out about this at the last minute, I just stole them from the Japan Embassy,\u201d said Li Muyan unabashedly.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ning Xi knew Li Muyan was kidding, but she was still surprised. Then again, considering his career, it might be pretty normal for him to say something like this.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Muye saw the strange man, he turned from the usual blondie into a lion. He was on high alert.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, this is my senior, Jiang Muye,\u201d Ning Xi introduced them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Muyan,\u201d Li Muyan introduced himself and extended his hand for a handshake, then he said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you, Mr. Jiang. You\u2019re very famous after all, and my cousin is a big fan of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was one sweet tongue\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye reached out for his hand half-heartedly. After a sloppy shake, he said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Muyan did not stay for long and left after a short conversation.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye quickly asked Ning Xi the moment the man left, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe son of my aunt\u2019s close friend. He\u2019s a diplomat officer. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ning Xi asked back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye mumbled, \u201cNothing, I just feel something\u2019s odd\u2026 Does he like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so! He\u2019s been all over the world and seen all kinds of beautiful girls, so it couldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was happily sending messages to Lu Tingxiao as she replied him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

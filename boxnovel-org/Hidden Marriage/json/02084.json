His collar revealed his inner white shirt and the shiny, black buttons on the sleeves gave off a cold light.</p><br/><p>The VIP room was spacious enough to gather all the relatives and friends around, but as the man entered the room, the room seemed to become so small and crowded as though it was not enough to contain the aura he gave off.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua\u2019s arrogant expression was petrified as if he could not believe his own eyes. \u201cLu\u2026 Lu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was so shocked that he could not say the next word after \u201cLu\u201d.</p><br/><p>The relatives from the two families who had mocked Ning Xi just now were now silent. They could not believe that the person who only existed in legends and casual chats, who was so high and mighty that even prestigious families like them might never meet him even once in their life, had just appeared before their eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>They did not even recall how he looked like some years ago until recently, about two years ago, Lu Tingxiao started appearing in public. His picture was framed up in the room of many girls in Imperial. With the title of \u201cNational Husband\u201d, his popularity was even higher than some of the male celebrities in the country.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s actual face was much better-looking than those blurry photos and videos, especially the aura he gave off, which was breathtakingly impactful.</p><br/><p>He had a black windbreaker on top of his suit and an aloof assistant was behind him while two fully armed bodyguards were right outside the room.</p><br/><p>A strong killing intent was in the air\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cG-gosh\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s Lu\u2026 Lu Tingxiao\u2026 I\u2019m not dreaming\u2026\u201d After some time, someone came back to their senses.</p><br/><p>The others reacted as well. \u201cSomeone, pinch me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so\u2026 so handsome! He\u2019s much better-looking than in the pictures!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going crazy! What\u2019s happening? Why is Lu Tingxiao here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Not just these people, Ning Xi was pretty surprised herself. She never expected Lu Tingxiao to appear here, moreover, in such a high profile manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 Aren\u2019t you coming back the day after tomorrow?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s frigid eyes melted like snow in the spring when he looked at Ning Xi. He did not reply, instead, just frowning at the girl.</p><br/><p>He took off his windbreaker and went up to her.</p><br/><p>He touched the girl\u2019s hands, then spread the windbreaker over her shoulders. He sounded grumpy. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say that the temperature\u2019s been getting lower recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glanced at the long woolen dress she had on. \u201cI\u2019ve put on a lot of layers already\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao squeezed the girl\u2019s hands. \u201cYour hands are cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.

The sweetness and intimacy between their exchanges of words were enough to melt anyone!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi?</p><br/><p>This was crazy!</p><br/><p>W-what was happening?</p><br/><p>What happened next would astound them even more!</p></div>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s a real emergency this time! If you don\u2019t go home right now, Little Treasure is going to destroy the house! They couldn\u2019t contact you or Ning Xi, so they could only call me!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ning Xi spoke from behind, clearly having just awoken, \u201cWhat happened to Little Treasure? I\u2019ll go back right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said so, she took up her bag and even helped Lu Tingxiao pack his things in ten seconds, \u201cQuick, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them quickly rushed back to the Lu residence.</p><br/><p>When they entered the compound, Ning Xi stared blankly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of situation is this! What are those?\u201d There were shiny, silvery white humanoid figures walking around chaotically all over the place. Ning Xi rubbed her eyes and stared at the scene with astonishment, feeling as if she had just stepped into a parallel dimension.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli blinked, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell? They\u2019re robots!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was about to go crazy, \u201cOf course I can tell\u2026 but, why are there so many robots?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was about to have a headache, \u201cThis is one of Little Treasure\u2019s hobbies. It\u2019s been awhile since he has taken them out to play with. Isn\u2019t this great? The moment he got agitated, he let all of them out. It looks like we\u2019ve just stepped into a fortress besieged by zombies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the area within their sights, there were already more than twenty robots wreaking havoc everywhere.</p><br/><p>Digging into the ground, running around crazily, crashing into trees, trampling on flowers\u2026 One of them even picked up a maid\u2026 Accompanying all this was the screams of the servants. The entire scene was a huge mess\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing that the maid was about to fall from the hands of the robot, Ning Xi quickly opened the car door and ran over, managing to catch the maid before she crashed into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright, Wanwan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanwan patted her chest, still frightened. She then turned to look at Ning Xi in gratitude, \u201cThank you Miss Xi! Miss Xi, you\u2019ve come back! Quickly, go find the little young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Lu residence, all the servants, especially the female ones, were cautious and unaccepting of Ning Xi, but they just didn\u2019t dare to show it in front of her. It was only Wanwan who had more interaction with her after regularly sending Little Treasure\u2019s handmade fruit juice to her while she was on set. Wanwan had a good impression of her after seeing that Ning Xi didn\u2019t use the eldest young master and the little young master\u2019s doting affection to bully the servants, and even had a modest and humble attitude.</p><br/><p>After watching Ning Xi nimbly save the damsel in distress, Lu Tingxiao, who was still in the car, had a begrudging expression.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli stuck his head out of the car window and bawled resentfully, \u201cXiao Xi Xi, you\u2019re not supposed to do that! You took my role! Ow! Help me\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, one of his arms got grabbed by a robot.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, save me! Turn this thing off quickly!\u201d Lu Jingli, who had just been howling about missing the chance to play the hero, was requesting for help himself.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at him as if he wanted to help, but was unable to, \u201cLittle Treasure altered his program since the last time, I need an hour to crack it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hour! My arm\u2019s going to break by then! Ah ah ah, it hurts, ow, ow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Little Treasure now?\u201d Ning Xi hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be in the control room.\u201d Lu Tingxiao quickly got out of the car. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d The two of them hurriedly ran towards the control room.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli watched their disappearing figures with expectation, \u201cMake it quick!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

My Brother Wants To Jump Into The River?</p><br/><p>Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation</p><br/><p>Up front, for the safety of driving the car, the chauffeur very consciously pressed the button that wound up the divider for their privacy.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi puffed up her cheeks and looked angry. She definitely had a reason to believe that Lu Tingxiao was intentionally taking revenge because she said that the 90 percent was for Little Treasure...</p><br/><p>Looking at the girl's lively expression, Lu Tingxiao's gaze turned into a deep, bottomless swirl, capturing one's soul...</p><br/><p>He always could not help but stare at her and want to get close to her. All because he did not feel secure.</p><br/><p>When they got down from the car, Lu Tingxiao walked her to the door of her apartment.</p><br/><p>\"Stay at home to rest well for the next few days. Don't run around,\" reminded Lu Tingxiao seriously.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded obediently. \"Definitely, with this leg of mine, even if I wanted to run, I couldn't!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked suspiciously at her. He bet that even if both her legs were shot, it would not stop her from actively moving around...</p><br/><p>Ning Xi knew that she had many bad past records, so she coughed lightly and reassured, \"It's true, I guarantee that I won't run around! Take my word for it!\"</p><br/><p>After she repeated this over and over again, Lu Tingxiao had no choice but to believe her. \"Then, I'll leave now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Eh? Leaving so soon?! It's still quite early, why don't you come in for some tea before you leave?\" Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>In a flash, the man's expression instantly became dangerous again. \"Do you know what those words of yours imply to a man?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was instantly confused and her mouth twitched. \"Hey! What are you thinking? I'm just inviting you to come in for a cup of tea! I'm implying what the words say on the surface! I'm not inviting you in to do whatnot! Lu Tingxiao, are you that corrupted now?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao held her by the waist and kissed her roughly as if he wanted to deliver all his buried emotions through the kiss. \"Infected by you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless. Her fault again...</p><br/><p>Also, why was it that now whenever she and the devil were not on the same page, they would start kissing?</p><br/><p>After he left the Regal Riveria, Lu Tingxiao did not go home immediately. He went to the riverside instead.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, you're not going home...?\" Cheng Feng hesitated to ask.</p><br/><p>He had already gotten what he wanted. Why did it feel like the boss still had things weighing on his mind?</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\" Under the cold breeze across the river, Lu Tingxiao lit up a cigarette and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Cheng Feng did not want to ask too much either, so he just left.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao obviously wanted to be alone for a while, that much Cheng Feng could tell. Thus, Cheng Feng and the chauffeur got into the car and left first.</p><br/><p>Halfway through, the chauffeur's phone rang. It was Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Second Master!\"</p><br/><p>\"Where's my brother? Did you guys pick him up?\" Lu Jingli sounded a little awkward on the other end of the phone.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, we already did. Second Master, is there anything you need?\"</p><br/><p>\"Then, why isn't he back yet?\" It seemed like Lu Jingli was already waiting at home.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, Master hasn't gone home yet. He sent Miss Ning Xi home first then went to the riverside alone,\" answered the chauffeur truthfully.</p><br/><p>\"What? My brother wants to jump into the river!\" shouted Lu Jingli before the chauffeur could continue, then the phone went dead.</p><br/><p>The chauffeur's eardrums were shaken by the yell and he was stunned. \"I...when did I say Master wants to jump into the river? I didn't, did I? I just said he went to the riverside!\"</p><br/><p>How did Second Master hear what he thought he did? How in the world did he misunderstand like that?</p><br/><p>Cheng Feng's mouth twitched in amusement. \"Second Master's thought process is rather out of the ordinary.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Everyone was jostling around crazily, while the security guards were threatening the crowd with batons and kept on blowing their whistles, but it was all futile. There were cries and screams of people being pushed in the crowd\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Uhh, I understand everyone's excited, but please control yourself a little!\"</p><br/><p>\"Right, everyone please be quiet!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The hosts tried to calm the crowd, but no one listened to them.

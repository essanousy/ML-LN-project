As long as Ning Xi was willing, it was not impossible to seize the role.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>After they finished discussing, Ning Xi started to prepare for the audition that would be happening in a week.</p><br/><p>Actually, this role was indeed purely to reveal a face as a passerby. It could not even measure up to her role in \u201cThunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u201d before her scenes were added.</p><br/><p>However, the movie \u201cAssassin\u201d was special to Ning Xi, especially the female lead\u2019s role, Anna. It was one of her favorite characters.</p><br/><p>This time, she would use this opportunity to study this classic once again.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>A week later, the auditions for \u201cAssassin\u201d began.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Xu Tao reached the audition location on time.</p><br/><p>When they reached, because the manager and assistants could not enter, Xu Tao gave Ning Xi a pep talk before waiting outside.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi skimmed the crowd which was basically all A-listers, but their statuses were unevenly matched. The only similarity of all those here was their popularity and how much they were the talk of the tabloids.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that the film crew had only chosen a role for a Chinese just for the market in China.</p><br/><p>In the waiting room, when they saw Ning Xi come, many artistes had gone up to her to politely make small talk and greet her.</p><br/><p>The entertainment industry commonly flattered the superiors and trampled the inferiors. Because Ning Xi had been in the limelight recently, naturally people would try to befriend her.</p><br/><p>However, because their relationship with Glory World was tense, a few of Starlight\u2019s artistes just watched from a corner with indifference as they muttered softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi came too. Doesn\u2019t she know that today\u2019s audition is just for show? Zixuan has long been internally decided, and she\u2019s not even here today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe must be unwilling to give up! This is an audition for \u2018Assassin\u2019, Hollywood\u2019s ultimate classic! She\u2019s fighting so intensely with Han Zixuan right now, so how could she not turn up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to talk about opportunity, Starlight has Zixuan\u2019s back. Ning Xi can\u2019t catch up. In China, she has some sort of foundation, so that\u2019s fine, but to climb up further will definitely be hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe looks like she has overcome Han Zixuan by a little right now. Actually, it\u2019s probably the furthest she can go. I think even Yin Youyou who hopped over to Starlight has brighter prospects than her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Amidst the whispers, a female staff who appeared Chinese walked over to announce that the audition had begun.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please enter according to your numbered sequence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Ning Xi had registered later, she was arranged to be last.</p><br/><p>Even though they knew that they were just here for show, they still could not help but have a hint of wishful thinking. All of the female artistes waiting for their turn to audition started to nervously fix their makeup.</p><br/><p>However, slowly, the anticipation on everyone\u2019s faces started to fade\u2026</p><br/><p>The way the people inside kept calling out the numbers, every artiste was inside for barely ten seconds on average.</p><br/><p>There were even some who came out after three to five seconds.</p><br/><p>What kind of audition was this?</p><br/><p>Three to five seconds was not even enough to take a proper look at someone\u2019s face!</p><br/><p>( )</p><br/><p>\u201cDang! Hollywood is extremely blunt now! When they say it\u2019s just for show, they really mean it! They aren\u2019t even trying to fake it a little!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have such a huge lineup for the filming crew. It\u2019s already not too shabby that they were willing to organize an audition. What more do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, after all, the ones in the audition are all of Hollywood\u2019s big shots. Today, I\u2019ll just take it as coming to see them in real life, and gain some experience!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

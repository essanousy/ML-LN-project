From the corner of her eye, she noticed that her votes had completely been surpassed by Ning Xi, and she saw that the audience\u2019s cheers and shrieks did not seem to be for her.</p><br/><p>At this moment, she suddenly realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>When she spun around, she was shocked to see that on the huge screen behind her was a close-up of Ning Xi and not her!</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan\u2019s expression suddenly turned pale and she messed up her footwork as she instantly missed the beat.</p><br/><p>When Zheng Anru noticed it off-stage, she was so anxious that her face was filled with horror.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! What are those people doing backstage!? This is Zixuan\u2019s slot! Where are the cameras pointing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, what was even sadder was that even though Han Zixuan had made such a huge mistake, not a single person had noticed.</p><br/><p>They had both teased the crowd, but upon comparing Han Zixuan\u2019s and Ning Xi\u2019s way, the winner was obvious.</p><br/><p>Zixuan was rather deliberate and overly sculpted, giving people the impression that she was dull. It was Ning Xi\u2019s lack of self-awareness as though she was saying, \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t even think about teasing you\u201d that wiped out both the men and the women, causing everyone to go insane for her.</p><br/><p>Even just a small action, a slight gaze could make one\u2019s heart race.</p><br/><p>Finally, on the stage, Han Zixuan\u2019s performance ended.</p><br/><p>On the huge screen to the left, Ning Xi\u2019s votes had unexpectedly surpassed Han Zixuan by a terrifying rate of two times more.</p><br/><p>In fact, she was leading by a wide margin for both categories!</p><br/><p>This performance was supposed to be Han Zixuan\u2019s killer move to pull for votes and they had even moved her slot up, yet it had instead thrown her straight to hell.</p><br/><p>When Zheng Anru saw the numbers that were impossible to outdo, she immediately stood up, then blankly fell back down into her seat with complete disbelief written all over her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 This is impossible! How was this possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo amazing! Bro Xi! Your votes made a comeback! In fact, you\u2019ve outdone the others by a wide margin! And it\u2019s still rising!\u201d Qin Xiao Shuang had been watching Ning Xi\u2019s votes closely and at this moment, she was incredibly excited.</p><br/><p>This was a miracle\u2026</p><br/><p>This person before her always had a way to do the impossible.</p><br/><p>As long as she was by her side, she would feel at ease!</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye peeked at Qin Shuang and held his chin as his mouth twitched. \u201cGreat, you\u2019ve seduced another one, you bad person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was jealous, seeing that Ning Xi was finally dominating the ranks with him, Jiang Muye still felt quite happy.</p><br/><p>Tsk, tsk, tsk! The ranks would look awesome!</p><br/><p>Most Popular Male Artiste No. 1: Jiang Muye</p><br/><p>National Male Idol: Jiang Muye</p><br/><p>Most Desired Male Artiste To Sleep With No. 1: Jiang Muye</p><br/><p>Most Popular Female Artiste No. 1: Ning Xi</p><br/><p>National Goddess No. 1: Ning Xi</p><br/><p>The five most influential categories would all be dominated by Glory World Entertainment!</p><br/><p>As for the National Husband title that was held steady by Lu Tingxiao, he was still one of them too!</p><br/><p>Yet, very soon, Jiang Muye\u2019s happiness was short-lived.</p><br/><p>With the end of Han Zixuan\u2019s performance, the other performances began.

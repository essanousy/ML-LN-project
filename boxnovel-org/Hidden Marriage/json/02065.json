Did something happen?\u201d The moment Zeus noticed Jason and the rest react in fear, he could not help but frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. Earlier, when we were eating, these people suddenly popped out of nowhere and wanted to kill us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s single casual sentence shocked Zeus and Bardy silly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, what did you say?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese bastards wanted to kill you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jason looked like he was about to cry. \u201cBoss Zeus, listen to me explain! It\u2019s not what you think! I\u2026 I secretly took an order. The other party wanted the Chinese artiste, Ning Xi\u2019s life. I didn\u2019t know\u2026 I really didn\u2019t know this person\u2019s identity was actually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi heard him, her brows shot up. \u201cOh? Someone wants my life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes, they offered $10 million. I\u2026 I was momentarily bewitched by the money\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jason said this, Tang Lang clutched his stomach and laughed until he almost rolled on the ground. \u201cPfft, hahaha\u2026 I\u2019m dying! Someone actually offered $10 million to assassinate the legendary Thousand-Face Ghost Hand Tang Xi and the assassin they hired was even of such a ranking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn! Thousand-Face Ghost Hand Tang Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>The way Jason looked at Ning Xi, one could tell he was horrified.</p><br/><p>Was Tang Xi not a man?</p><br/><p>When she saw Tang Lang rejoicing in her misfortunes, Ning Xi\u2019s expression was dark as the bottom of a pot. \u201cThat\u2019s enough from you! Is it so amazing that your head is worth more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, little sheep, which idiot hired you?\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao asked with a giggle.</p><br/><p>Jason looked troubled. \u201cWell\u2026 Well\u2026 Superior, you know how the industry works\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If he mentioned the client\u2019s name, he would not need to roll in the industry anymore.</p><br/><p>The moment Jason said that, Bardy viciously kicked him to the ground. \u201cShit! You idiot! Motherf*cker, do you have shit as your brains?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jason was booted until his bones almost cracked. At the same time, he was finally clear-headed. He could barely save his own life. Who cared about the rules of this stupid industry?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi waved indifferently and smiled. \u201cEnough. He doesn\u2019t need to say it but I probably know who.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Master Han Xiao keeping watch by her side, no one would be so stupid to still dare come for her.</p><br/><p>These little fishes and shrimp might just be commoners who were not in the circle.</p><br/><p>Lorraine Fashion Week had just ended not too long ago when she was attacked. Furthermore, she connected it to the incident in the \u201cThunderbolt\u201d filming crew when the fake gun was swapped for a real one.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi probed, \u201cLet me ask you. Did your client once make you kidnap a Chinese student who was studying abroad, then threaten his sister to do things for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the previous incident had been exposed, Jason\u2019s little figure trembled. He was giving everything up! \u201cYes, yes\u2026 Boss, I don\u2019t dare anymore! I\u2019ll just send this offer back! I won\u2019t be involved with that person anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled mysteriously to herself. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Her hair was tied back in a handsome high ponytail, her eyebrows were dark and arched, and she had a threatening heroic spirit. She looked exactly like a 16-year-old Meng Changge.</p><br/><p>Even those people who had always been biased against Ning Xi couldn\u2019t help but admit that she looked perfect for the role.</p><br/><p>At first, Guo Qisheng had been worried that an extremely beautiful female actress like Ning Xi would only be able to act a particular type of role. He didn\u2019t expect that she would actually be this malleable. He praised her with satisfaction and then warned her anxiously, \u201cNing Xi, in a moment, you need to let loose a little. Don\u2019t be too concerned about your appearance, okay? For this scene, you need to act like a ruffian. The wilder the better!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, you can relax. I believe she can do it!\u201d By this time, Jiang Muye had also finished changing into costume and had just walked out of the dressing room.</p><br/><p>The moment Jiang Muye pushed aside the curtains and walked out, the set immediately burst out in gasps of astonishment, and even Ning Xi raised her eyebrows in surprise.</p><br/><p>After getting into costume, Jiang Muye\u2019s entire temperament had changed. Wearing a cyan robe with bamboo prints, his face was like jade and his eyebrows were warm and kind. It seemed as if he had walked out of an old painting.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye proudly shot a glance at the stunned Ning Xi. He whispered, \u201cWhat do you think? Aren\u2019t the heavens crying from my handsomeness??\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a pity the image was ruined the moment he opened his mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi maintained a modest expression, as if she was discussing the plot with Jiang Muye. She spoke three words,</p><br/><p>\u201cSubmissive and weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? What about me? I\u2019m sorry to inform you, but in this story you\u2019re completely. Oppressed. By. Me!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah? Then why do I recall a scene where I counterattack? It even seems to be a bed scene. Tsk tsk\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Not far away, Jia Qingqing watched the two people who were sticking their heads close together and whispering into each other\u2019s ears from time to time. She was so jealous she was about to lose her rational mind.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had arrived, Jiang Muye had given all his attention to Ning Xi. He hadn\u2019t even so much as glanced in her direction. She didn\u2019t even have an opportunity to greet him.</p><br/><p>By her side, Ning Xueluo was continuously \u2018comforting\u2019 her. \u201cQingqing, don\u2019t get angry. Things have already become like this. After all, in the entertainment industry, luck is also a part of one\u2019s strength. Ning Xi had the good luck to get Jiang Muye as her acting partner. I\u2019m guessing that after this movie, she\u2019ll be able to enter the ranks of second tier actors. There\u2019s even a chance that she could get into the first tier\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, even the first tier? She dared to steal my possessions, did you think I would let her have an easy time?\u201d Jia Qingqing\u2019s originally pretty face was now exceptionally twisted with malice.</p><br/><p>\u201cQingqing, don\u2019t be too impulsive. The company is preparing to invest a lot of effort into developing Ning Xi. If you tangle with her now, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I tangle with her? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re scared of a man-eating vixen like her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that the company was preparing to develop Ning Xi, Jia Qingqing was even more furious. After all, the type of movies she acted in were similar to Ning Xi\u2019s. If the company elevated Ning Xi, there was a large likelihood that a portion of her own resources would be taken away.</p><br/><p>Watching Jia Qingqing become completely fired up, Ning Xueluo secretly smiled.</p><br/><p>With Jia Qingqing as a knife, she didn\u2019t have to use her own hands at all. All she needed to do was sit back and enjoy the show.</p><br/><p>However, Ning Xi\u2019s luck did seem to be running a little too well recently. Some precautions needed to be taken\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Xiao Cui? Have the props been prepared?\u201d Guo Qisheng shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cComing, coming. Director, will this do?\u201d The prop master brought a hemp rope over.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Guo Qisheng nodded and then called to Jiang Muye, \u201cMuye, I\u2019ll have to inconvenience you a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no inconvenience. This is necessary for filming the scene!\u201d Jiang Muye looked dedicated to his work as he laid down on a large carved bed with ease, allowing the prop master to bind his arms and legs.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. As the director had mentioned, this scene was\u2026 very intense\u2026</p><br/><p>After Meng Changge\u2019s confession to Sun Huanqing had been met with rejection, she had immediately kidnapped him and brought him home\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

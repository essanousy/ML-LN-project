It was clear that he took it off for the night to pick up girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes\u201d Ning Xi obligingly replied, leaning back lazily.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s face flashed with a ray of light, \u201cCan I sit down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ning Xi smiled gently at him, and he took the obvious hint.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s happiness couldn\u2019t be concealed, and he began his standard pickup lines , \u201cAre you in a bad mood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed, \u201cYes, I fell out of love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are such a great beauty; how could you have romantic troubles? Which man is so stupid to break up with you?\u201d He replied, with a surprised expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was me who dumped him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026\u2026it must mean that you are angry now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! I only came to the nightclub to look for a date, just to play around, but after he found out, he made a big fuss about it, isn\u2019t that aggravating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201d the man was choked speechless.</p><br/><p>Why does he find these lines so familiar?</p><br/><p>It sounds like the complaints he made to his friends just now about his wife making a fuss all day long\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>However, he was mesmerized by the behaviour of the woman in front of his eyes, so he did not realize that he has been tricked by her.</p><br/><p>After three rounds of drinking, they walked out of the bar together.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere shall we go? Junlai or Mingzhu?\u201d the man asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should we go to the hotel! Just here ba!\u201d Ning Xi pulled the man into an alley at the side.</p><br/><p>The man excitedly panted, then pressed her onto the wall, \u201cYes, you are right\u2026\u2026 doing it here is more stimulating\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As they were talking, they did not notice that in an area five steps away, a black car without a license-plate was quietly parked there.</p><br/><p>Inside the car, no matter how calm Lu Ting Xiao is, currently a thick layer of frost has formed on him.</p><br/><p>And beside him, Lu Jingli is already regretting until his intestines turned green.</p><br/><p>Because he had a strong hunch that there will be something major happening tonight, so he did not sleep for the entire night, and indeed, he inadvertently saw through his window Ning Xi, followed by his brother, leaving the house, thus he shamelessly followed over, but he would have never imagined\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Things have progressed to this stage!</p><br/><p>He is soon unable to withstand his brother\u2019s face, which is so scary that it can stop hungry infants from crying.</p><br/><p>Watching the man\u2019s pig hands touching Ning Xi\u2019s waist, even if Lu Ting Xiao was an immortal descended to earth, his endurance should be broken already.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli could tell, that Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s patience was wearing thin, as thin as a strand of hair, \u201cBrother, are you not going to make any move?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s voice was as cold as iron: \u201cLet\u2019s wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was so anxious that he could not stay still, \u201cLook at them! What are you waiting for? If you do not make any move soon, you will become green*! Even though Little Xixi has toned down a lot these two years, but she has a bad record, it\u2019s hard to change for the good, but to become bad again, it is super easy\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right when Lu Jingli shut his eyes as he did not dared to look anymore, a piercing cry was heard\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? This sound is not right\u2026\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli immediately opened his eyes, then saw the man clutching on to his lifeblood, his screams more miserable than pigs when getting slaughtered.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, Ning Xi kicked him again, the man fell hard onto the ground face down, and when he was about to get up, he was stepped on by Ning Xi on his back, his chin on the ground, and fresh blood was dripping from the corner of his lips\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli felt pain just looking at the scene, he could not bear to witness it anymore and cover his eyes, \u201cSister-in-law is so brutal ah ah ah ah\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(*T/N: it has roughly the same meaning as wearing a green hat ; in china, when a man is cheated on by his lover, he will be called wearing a green hat\u2026)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She showed a smile that came from the depths of her heart, \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the girl\u2019s smile blossomed, Lu Tingxiao shook subtly for a moment.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked towards little bun at the side, \u201cI\u2019m especially grateful to Little Treasure, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it to the audition in time if it weren\u2019t for him! Here darling, let me toast you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure looked at his cup of milk, then at Ning Xi and Daddy\u2019s beers. Although reluctant, he finally raised his cup to toast with Ning Xi. He then downed the rest of the milk in one gulp.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his serious demeanour. He probably knows how to act like an adult drowning their sorrows in drink too?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao went to the balcony to take a call halfway through the meal.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately pressed close to Little Treasure\u2019s side. She handed her beer over to him, \u201cHeh heh! Curious about the taste? Quickly, taste it while your dad isn\u2019t here! You can only have a small mouthful though!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure\u2019s eyes lit up like stars in the night sky, he lowered his head and carefully took a small sip.</p><br/><p>He felt extremely happy even though the taste was horrible.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately sat up when Lu Tingxiao returned from his call, acting as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was even more professional. He slowly drank his milk, completely unflustered.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked as if he had not noticed anything, but a glimmer of warmth flashed in his eyes as he sat down with a normal expression.</p><br/><p>The three of them had good appetites. They managed to finish everything even though she bought a lot of ingredients.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was thinking it was time for them so leave as it was getting quite late. Suddenly, lightning flashed across the sky. Shortly after, thunder started booming loudly and fierce winds started to blow outside\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw that the weather forecast predicted heavy rain and typhoon for tonight\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at the pouring rain outside the window with a troubled expression. Little bun and Lu Tingxiao both looked at Ning Xi\u2026..</p><br/><p>After getting stared at by the pair, Ning Xi could only say, \u201cGoing back with Little Treasure at this time is a little dangerous since it\u2019s already this late and the weather isn\u2019t looking too favourable. Maybe you could stay over here for tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had extended the offer purely out of courtesy, she thought there was no way Lu Tingxiao would agree. The result being\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little bun nodded.</p><br/><p>WHAT!? why did you agree again\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was way too easy going!</p><br/><p>Why did she have a feeling the pair had just been waiting for her to make the offer?</p><br/><p>She was going crazy!!!</p><br/><p>Just like that, Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure were going to stay over in the end.</p><br/><p>The apartment that her company had arranged for her was not that large, it only had a living room and a bedroom. The sleeping arrangements were indeed a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep in the living room for tonight. Mr Lu, is it okay if you sleep with Little Treasure in my room? I\u2019ll go change the bedsheets\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll sleep in the living room, you should sleep with Little Treasure in the bedroom.\u201d Lu Tingxiao stated with a tone that would not accept any protest.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt that she was digging holes for herself. Not only had she invited CEO Lu to eat a cheap hotpot, she was even making him sleep in the living room.</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t have let Lu Tingxiao stay if he were the only one here. Especially after what Lu Tingxiao had said in the day, and it being only the two of them under the same roof. </p><br/><p>Out of consideration of little bun however, she didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><br/><p>It was too dangerous to let him bring a child back in this weather. It couldn\u2019t be considered a couple left alone together since little bun was here\u2026..right?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could only resign herself to her fate, \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can find a change of clothes for both of you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She was able to find a change of clothes for them after rummaging through her closet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

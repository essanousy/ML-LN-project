I just have a cut in my mouth, it\u2019ll be alright after I apply some ice to it. Qingqing-jie was most likely just trying to make the scene look even more real, so don\u2019t get angry\u2026\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s expression showed that she had suffered unrightfully but was trying to bear with it. She looked like she was trying to endure silently with understanding.</p><br/><p>With that expression, even the rest of the crowd felt some sympathy towards her, let alone the director.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was watching from the side as the corner of his mouth twitched crazily. He was almost shocked to death.</p><br/><p>This fellow\u2026 was pretty good at playing an innocent flower\u2026</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing looked at her delicate appearance, and was instantly furious, \u201cNing Xi, you\u2019re still pretending! You clearly did it on purpose! You bit yourself! Did you hide some blood capsules in your mouth beforehand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJia Qingqing, that\u2019s enough from you!\u201d Guo Qisheng admonished fiercely.</p><br/><p>The assistant by Jia Qingqing\u2019s side hurriedly pulled her back and persuaded, \u201cQingqing-jie, forget about it! Don\u2019t make the director angry! We\u2019re in the wrong for this incident\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She clearly thought that Jia Qingqing had done it on purpose. She had seen too many incidents like this while following at Jia Qingqing\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing turned back and slapped the assistant on her face, \u201cScram! When has it ever been your place to command me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant fell to the floor after getting hit, just like Ning Xi had. There was even blood coming out from the corner of her mouth.</p><br/><p>The production crew surrounding them, especially those whose positions weren\u2019t very high like the assistant\u2019s, hurried forward to help the assistant up. Their expressions when looking at Jia Qingqing were full of disgust.</p><br/><p>Although Ning Xi had a messy personal life, she had never let it affect anyone else. She was respectful and professional while filming. However, Jia Qingqing was a complete shrew!</p><br/><p>It was the first time Jia Qingqing had been falsely accused. Seeing that no one believed her, her face turned red, as if she was about to faint from anger in the next second.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to lose control and attack Ning Xi without caring for her image, someone stepped out to pull on her wrist\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cQingqing, I know you wanted to impress the director, but you didn\u2019t have to take it so far. Those in the know would say that you\u2019re dedicated to your work, but how would others think of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who spoke up was Ning Xueluo, who had just rushed over.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo didn\u2019t have any scenes today, she didn\u2019t have to come, but for the sake of seeing Ning Xi in trouble, she had still come to the set. She hadn\u2019t thought that this was what she would see upon arriving\u2026</p><br/><p>What was this Jia Qingqing doing?</p><br/><p>It had been such a great opportunity, but she had let it play out this way?</p><br/><p>Seeing that the crowd was about to sympathise with Ning Xi due to their extreme hatred for Jia Qingqing, Ning Xueluo hurriedly went up to help her out of her predicament.</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing reacted as if she had just seen her family upon seeing Ning Xueluo. She immediately held onto her and cried as she complained, \u201cXueluo-jie, this bitch is trying to slander me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Afraid that Jia Qingqing would annoy even more people if she continued talking, Ning Xueluo pulled her into a corner, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you hold on for a while longer? Ning Xi will be chased off sooner or later, what are you doing picking fights with her at this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing anxiously said, \u201cI wanted to teach her a lesson at first, but I didn\u2019t even touch her at all! She just dodged and acted as if I hit her so hard that she spat out blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo took one look at the director reassuring Ning Xi, who was putting on a generous air, and could immediately tell what kind of act she was trying to pull. She hurriedly tried to think of a way to save the situation and said: \u201cQingqing, it\u2019s not enough that I believe you. The problem is that everyone doesn\u2019t believe you. Even if you explain the situation, it won\u2019t help. The best way to get out of this mess is to apologise to Ning Xi immediately\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing exploded upon hearing this, \u201cWhat? You want me to apologise to her! No way! Xueluo-jie, how could you stand on her side and speak for her!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The little bunny he was looking at suddenly became a monster in his eyes. As he was trying to make sense of what had just happened, he heard someone calling him.</p><br/><p>\"Master Mo...Master Mo\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian turned around, surprised to see a young soldier in his uniform. \"Aren\u2019t you the security for Uncle Zhuang, Xiao Chen?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that\u2019s me!\" Xiao Chen nodded.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s up?\" Mo Lingtian asked.</p><br/><p>\"I have something to ask. Master Mo, were you here since just now?\" Xiao Chen asked.</p><br/><p>\"Yeap, I was.\"</p><br/><p>\"Great! Do you know who got that perfect streak on the ninth target?\" Xiao Chen queried.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian raised his eyebrows. So, he was here to ask about this...</p><br/><p>\"Of course I do. It\u2019s that girl!\" Mo Lingtian told him, vaguely nodding his head in a direction.</p><br/><p>\"A girl?\" Xiao Chen was taken aback.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian nodded. \"Yeah!\"</p><br/><p>He was already surprised by the fact that it was a girl. What would happen if he knew exactly which girl?</p><br/><p>\"Who is it? The lady in black?\" Xiao Chen looked around and asked about Guan Ziyao.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian smirked. \"You\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s the one in the pink dress, white fluffy coat, and the bunny ear boots!\"</p><br/><p>\"Pink dress...white fluffy coat...bunny ear boots\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Chen set his sights on a girl beside a large-set, tall man, then he looked at Mo Lingtian and chuckled. \"Don\u2019t lie to me, Master Mo! The Chief ordered me to look for the person. Don\u2019t joke around with me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Who\u2019s joking\u2026\" Mo Lingtian stopped. \"Your Chief is here today?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, he\u2019s here with a few friends but when he heard the announcement, he left them and came straight here. It\u2019s been a while since I've seen him this excited,\" Xiao Chen said.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian swiveled around and as expected, he saw a well-built man among the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"Who is it? Tell me, please! Is it the man beside the girl in the pink dress? That looks like the CEO of Lu Corporation, Lu Tingxiao!\" Xiao Chen said.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian gave him a mysterious smile. \"Didn\u2019t I tell you? It\u2019s that little bunny!\"</p><br/><p>He patted Xiao Chen on the shoulder. \"I\u2019ll go over and greet your Chief!\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Chen stood there without a word, staring at the cute, young girl in disbelief.</p><br/><p>How was that possible!? If that little bunny could get six 10 points shots consecutively, then he could have joined the SWAT team!</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian went up to the Chief and greeted him warmly, \"Long time no see, Uncle Zhuang!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, Lingtian, are you here with friends?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! Uncle Zhuang. I heard from Xiao Chen that you\u2019re looking for someone?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\" The Chief nodded. \"Do you know the person?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\" Mo Lingtian then pointed at Ning Xi. \"It\u2019s the lady beside Lu Tingxiao. Can you see her? I told Xiao Chen but he didn\u2019t believe me, so I\u2019m here to tell you personally!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

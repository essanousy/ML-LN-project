Didn\u2019t you tell me previously that you believed in me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, your current appearance doesn\u2019t look very convincing.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression was grave.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was puzzled by his words until she remembered the makeup on her face. She explained, \u201cI made my skin this pale and drew these dark eyebags on myself. I\u2019m really not pretending to be strong. I can take off my makeup if you don\u2019t believe me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she finished speaking, Lu Tingxiao suddenly reached out and his fingertips softly grazed against her cheeks and eyes.</p><br/><p>Although it was only a light touch, Ning Xi looked as if she had been shocked by electricity. She couldn\u2019t help but tremble a bit.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s reaction caused Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face to darken slightly. He quickly retracted his hand and spoke, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to push yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled in reply, \u201cI won\u2019t. If I can\u2019t deal with this, I\u2019ll definitely fly back here and hug your leg!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having been soothed, Lu Tingxiao relaxed somewhat. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, Ning Xi scratched her head as she looked at him, looking like she wanted to speak but was holding back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you want to say something?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked in a gentle tone, as if the person last night had been a completely different person.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at him with a complicated expression for a long time. Finally, she couldn\u2019t help but speak up, \u201cUh, um, Lu Tingxiao, have you ever thought of finding a woman to keep you company?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression immediately turned cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for sticking my nose into your business. I just think\u2026\u201d Ning Xi considered her words carefully and then patted his shoulders with sincerity, \u201cI think you may need a woman. For some matters, restraining yourself isn\u2019t good for your health!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t there a common saying that went, one dreams at night what one thinks during the day?</p><br/><p>On the surface, Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t appear to be fazed by a woman\u2019s charms, but judging from his display last night, he clearly\u2026really seemed to need it\u2026</p><br/><p>At this point, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression was completely dark.</p><br/><p>Damned woman, who do you think is at fault here? Who do you think is forcing me to restrain myself so miserably when the treat is already so temptingly close?</p><br/><p>Seeing that Lu Tingxiao\u2019s complexion was worsening, Ning Xi coughed awkwardly and quickly slipped away, \u201cSince time is running out, I\u2019ll go say goodbye to Little Treasure and head off to the set! Bye bye~\u201d</p><br/><p>At the movie city on the outskirts of the capital.</p><br/><p>Just as Ning Xi appeared, a crowd of Jiang Muye\u2019s fans waiting by the entrance immediately rushed toward her with fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi! Ning Xi has arrived! That damn prostitute has arrived! She actually dared to appear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvil bitch! You\u2019re not allowed to get close to our Muye! Hurry up and get lost from this production!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi get lost from this production! Ning Xi get lost from the entertainment industry! Get lost from here!</p><br/><p> \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The scene was filled with chaos. Only a few security guards protected Ning Xi as she walked inside. The rest of the production crew stood around and watched the show. From time to time, they would point at her and laugh while sneering with laughter.</p><br/><p>Those stares were like daggers, cutting into her one by one. Those looks of malice were like a fierce and ferocious viper trying to tear her into shreds.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi couldn\u2019t help but recall that back in the day, there was a really popular female celebrity who had ultimately been forced to commit suicide due to gossip. After she died, her suicide note contained only five words: Gossip is a dreadful thing!</p><br/><p>The crowd continuously threw rotten eggs and spoiled vegetables. Some random person even threw a rock, although the rock was thrown askew\u2026</p><br/><p>When she saw that the rock was going to hit the makeup artist Amy, who was currently spectating, Ning Xi\u2019s expression changed and she quickly leapt forward. Right as the rock reached half a meter from Amy, she used her arm to block it.</p><br/><p>In the next second, the part of her arm that had been hit was drenched with blood.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

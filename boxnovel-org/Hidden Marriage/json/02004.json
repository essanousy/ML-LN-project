Ning Xueluo has already quit her career for a long time, and she\u2019s still not letting her off!]</p><br/><p>[Back then, didn\u2019t Ning Xueluo quit because Ning Xi used lowly tricks to force her out? Now that I think about it, Ning Xueluo has really endured quite a lot. She hasn\u2019t done anything outrageously harmful, and being carried home wrongly from the hospital isn\u2019t her fault. In the end, a certain someone keeps arguing about this point to death, forcing her until she can\u2019t even stay on in the entertainment industry. Now that I think about it, their social circle is really scary!]</p><br/><p>[Look at Ning Xi\u2019s vixen face. just one look and it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s up to no good. Doesn\u2019t she have a lot of scandals? Now, she\u2019s even more shameless. She\u2019s even seducing Ning Xueluo\u2019s husband! I feel bad that Ning Xueluo was persecuted to the point of forfeiting her past successes. Now, she just wants to be a good wife and be distant from worldly affairs, yet even that\u2019s hard to do. She already has to suffer nine months of pregnancy, and now even her husband\u2019s being seduced!]</p><br/><p>[Not long before, weren\u2019t there rumors that Starlight wants to poach Ning Xi? If I remember correctly, Su Yan\u2019s shares were already transferred to Ning Xueluo. Ning Xueluo is company\u2019s Vice CEO, but not long before Ning Xueluo was suddenly pushed out of the company for no reason and Su Yan took over. Now, Su Yan had taken over, yet he wanted to poach Ning Xi. Tsk tsk, it\u2019s really scary when you think about it!]</p><br/><p>[Trash man and cheap woman!]</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Rows and rows of name calling covered the entire comments section at the speed of light.</p><br/><p>Under the popular keyword searches, all sorts of hurled abuse and scoops emerged.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s fans exploded too. There was no way that they would believe that Ning Xi would do such a thing. When they saw the hurled abuses online, the true fans that supported Bro Xi immediately rolled their sleeves up and entered the battleground to tear things apart.</p><br/><p>It was just one morning, and the entire Weibo had been turned into a battlefield by name callers and true fans. Despite the true fans\u2019 intense fighting of pitting one against ten, they still could not block the hoards of astroturfers and masses who were unaware of the truth that kept bombarding them like mad.</p><br/><p>The hashtag \u2018#GetLostFromEntertainmentNingXi\u2019 had, in a flash, risen to number two on the rank of trending topics!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the rows of name calling and true fans protecting her on her screen. Her expression was suddenly\u2026 a little bemused.</p><br/><p>Her and Su Yan?!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had walked up to Ning Xi from behind. His profound eyes skimmed across the swear words on the computer that were an eyesore. He raised his hand and was ready to shut the laptop.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pollute your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, did I wake you up?\u201d Ning Xi immediately reached out to hold the screen. She first caressed Lu Tingxiao\u2019s neck and asked for a good morning kiss without saying anything, then she indifferently smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve seen all sorts of storms. This is child\u2019s play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not say anything, yet he kept his hand on the laptop.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi leaned back slightly and leaned against Lu Tingxiao\u2019s long legs. She raised her hand and pointed at the comment thread that survived in the gaps among the hurled abuses.</p><br/><p>[Nonsense! Would our Bro Xi fancy Su Yan, that soft egg? Does he think that he\u2019s invisible just because he has some stupid money? He really thinks that he\u2019s a rich man and loved by all!]</p><br/><p>[Ning Xueluo acted so horribly. No wonder back then, she couldn\u2019t continue in the movie and television industry. What else does a woman occupying someone else\u2019s place know apart from some crocodile tears to get sympathy? Just say if you\u2019re jealous of my Bro Xi. She\u2019s really going all out by using her husband to defame someone else!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, these are my true fans. This fighting strength, this sharpness\u2026 Tsk tsk, they\u2019re tough!\u201d Not only was Ning Xi not angry because of the hot topic, she was unexpectedly contented and started admiring her fans\u2019 fighting spirit in tearing the idiots apart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

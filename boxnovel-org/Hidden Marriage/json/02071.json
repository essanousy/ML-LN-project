What irrelevant character?! What cameo?!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had acted a total of 15 minutes in the movie. In fact, her character was extremely outstanding. There was even an ambiguous romance plot with Orlando and a foreshadowing of her at the end of the movie. There could very possibly a sequel when Ning Xi would be revived and joined the filming.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, all the fan groups were abuzz and Ning Xi\u2019s fans were elated.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh, oh, Bro Xi\u2019s red <em>qipao </em>in the movie was so pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDuh! Even I as a woman watched it until I wanted to lick the screen! Especially Bro Xi\u2019s scene with Orlando which was so full of love! I\u2019m so excited for the sequel!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow I want to go watch it for the second time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, who dares to say that my Bro Xi\u2019s \u2018Assassin\u2019 was gotten through connections and dirty tricks? I will slap them to the wall and stick them there until they can\u2019t be pulled out! Bro Xi already entered Hollywood since a year ago! Her real abilities and foundation are all right here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Ning Xueluo\u2019s moronic fans who still haven\u2019t given up were previously saying that Bro Xi stole Ning Xueluo\u2019s role in \u2018Thunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u2019! Please, back then when Ning Xueluo hadn\u2019t quit the industry, she only got a seven-second storyline. When it reached our Bro Xi\u2019s hands, Bro Xi immediately became an important character! This was how huge the gap was!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Inside the dim room.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s face reflected the cold light of her laptop screen. The Internet was currently covered with news about the release of \u201cThunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u201d. It was nothing but flattery all around for Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>It was hers\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u201d should have been hers!</p><br/><p>Everything Ning Xi had today should have been hers!</p><br/><p>All those eyes on her, all the applause, those flattering words\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Yan, the Ning family\u2026</p><br/><p>But, soon, very soon, it would all end.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo took the blood-red wine glass in her hand and downed it. \u201cHa, Ning Xi\u2026 Enjoy everything that you have right now. I\u2019ve said it before\u2026 The higher you stand, the uglier your fall will be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>In a certain luxury shopping mall in Imperial.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu had just finished browsing the baby shops and had a fruitful trip. She even wanted to continue although the two maids and the chauffeur beside her all had an assortment of bags in their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam, we\u2019ve been out for a long time today. Let\u2019s go home! Otherwise, Master will be worried!\u201d One of the maids quickly advised.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been an hour. Don\u2019t listen to him, always making a fuss about nothing,\u201d said Zhuang Lingyu with a dampened spirit.</p><br/><p>The maid smiled. \u201cMaster\u2019s just worried about you because he cares about you. After all, Madam, your child didn\u2019t come along easily!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the child was mentioned, Zhuang Lingyu touched her underbelly by reflex and her eyes were filled with tenderness.</p><br/><p>She was eager to excel. She had never said in front of anyone and had always treated Ning Xueluo like her biological daughter, yet the fact that her flesh and blood was so unbearable had been something that she could not get over.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was the largest stain in her life. No matter how she tried to sever ties, she could not change the fact that in her blood flowed in her veins.</p><br/><p>She urgently wanted to prove that the dirty stain had nothing to do with her, so she had given all of her care towards Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>She was obviously quite satisfied with Ning Xueluo, but if only she could get pregnant with another child, to have her own flesh and blood that would enable her to start over again, she would naturally be happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Zhuang Lingyu was in a chipper mood, so she did not fuss over the minor matter and just answered them matter-of-factly.</p><br/><p>The few of them felt relieved. They quickly guarded Zhuang Lingyu and walked towards the carpark.</p><br/><p>Just as they were helping Zhuang Lingyu into a car, an accident happened.</p></div>\n</div>"}

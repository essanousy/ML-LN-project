It looked like there was nothing out of the ordinary, but upon closer observation, you could see that he would sneak a peek at Ning Xi from time to time. The expression on his face was both lively and at peace.</p><br/><p>The old steward had felt rather anxious from his first look at Ning Xi, afraid that the eldest young master was being tricked by her, perhaps due to her exceptionally beautiful looks.</p><br/><p>From his observations thus far, she seemed somewhat safe, but she might just be waiting for the right moment to strike\u2026</p><br/><p>There were so many women eyeing the position of Mrs Lu and trying to think of all sorts of ways to become Little Treasure\u2019s stepmother.</p><br/><p>There had even been a terrible event two years ago, almost causing little young master to\u2026</p><br/><p>He had been on tenterhooks since seeing how the eldest young master trusted her and how the second young master was not stopping him. Even little young master seemed to like that woman a lot, so he couldn\u2019t help but to keep his guard up.</p><br/><p>Two hours had already passed unknowingly.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi was almost done with reading the script, Little Treasure had already finished his drawing and had trotted over to show it to her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi lifted her head to look, and her face was filled with surprise, \u201cThis\u2026 This drawing is of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She really couldn\u2019t tell from Little Treasure\u2019s quiet appearance that his drawing style would actually be Fauvism.</p><br/><p>Fauvism was characterised by the use of vibrant and heavy colours, straightforward and coarse brush strokes, to create an intense picture to express your innermost thoughts\u2026</p><br/><p>Although the person drawn in this picture looked somewhat strange, the drawing had accurately captured the characteristics of the person, so Ning Xi could recognise at one glance that the subject was herself.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure nodded while hugging the picture, he looked a little nervous, worried that she wouldn\u2019t like it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 simply amazing! Can I take a picture of this for my phone wallpaper?\u201d Ning Xi wasn\u2019t purposely trying to compliment Little Treasure, she actually liked Fauvism herself. She especially liked the strong contrast in colours. Looking at Little Treasure\u2019s drawing with a basic understanding of art appreciation, his standard was already at the level of a great master!</p><br/><p>Little Treasure pressed his lips together shyly and shoved the drawing into her hands.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pointed at herself, \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you! I love it so much!\u201d Ning Xi hugged the little bun and placed a kiss on his soft cheeks.</p><br/><p>The little bun was stunned for a moment before his face was covered in a fierce blush. His usually dazed eyes looked even more lively.</p><br/><p>The pair of adult and child were warmly interacting when Ning Xi heard footsteps from overhead.</p><br/><p>She raised her head to look towards the direction of the sound and saw Lu Tingxiao with casual home clothes and messy bed hair walking down lazily from the stairs\u2026</p><br/><p>Although Lu Tingxiao usually looked mesmerising, the gap between his current slovenly appearance and his normal appearance was too huge, resulting in a killer charm- he was so sexy there was no cure for it.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was dazed for quite a while before she could react, \u201cMr Lu, you\u2019re not working today?\u201d Wasn\u2019t it Monday today?</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I\u2019m resting today.\u201d Lu Tingxiao nodded.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought for a moment before realisation hit. He had just spent a lot of time and effort to sign a huge deal, so having a good rest was normal.</p><br/><p>So Big Boss Lu was also the kind to sleep in\u2026. She inexplicably felt closer to him\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

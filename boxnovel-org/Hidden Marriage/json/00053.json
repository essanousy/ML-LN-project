Taking it out didn\u2019t seem right, but shoving it back in didn\u2019t seem right either. It was really tragic.</p><br/><p>To make matters worse, the bra she was wearing today had been specially ordered. A triangular Superman logo was printed on both sides, it was extremely eye-catching.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had obviously noticed it. His brow ridge went up, but like a gentleman, he didn\u2019t display any other sign of shock, he coughed lightly before saying, \u201cSorry, I saw that the door wasn\u2019t closed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He prepared to leave when he finished speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s my fault for forgetting to close the door!\u201d Ning Xi deliberately acted calm and just pulled her bra out before stuffing it under a blanket. She fanned herself with one hand, \u201cUm, it\u2019s just too hot in the summer. You guys wouldn\u2019t understand the troubles women face! Uh, were you looking for me for something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come back this late? A date?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked, seeming like he didn\u2019t particularly care about the answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat date! I just met an especially loathsome person, and talked for a bit!\u201d Ning Xi grumbled with a wretched expression.</p><br/><p>Listening to her tone, it was clear that it wasn\u2019t a date. Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression relaxed slightly, \u201cI left dinner for you, come and eat when you\u2019re done with your shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I can settle my meals myself\u2026\u201d Ning Xi said in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one more place at the table.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, okay then.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lu Tingxiao walked away, Ning Xi hurriedly locked the door.</p><br/><p>She had forgotten that she wasn\u2019t at home and had actually made such a rudimentary mistake. She would have to take note of that from now.</p><br/><p>After having a shower and dinner, Ning Xi bundled up comfortably in bed and started to read the latest news on the web. Little bun was sprawled over the table, hugging a large book.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xueluo reveals her handsome and rich boyfriend, screen king Zhao bursts out in jealousy on the scene\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xueluo is full of praises for junior Ning Xi\u2019s beauty and acting skills\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi fully deserves the title of #1 Beauty in the entertainment circle, suppressing Jia Qingqing\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Changge outshines the other beauties at?Land Under Heaven?\u2019s opening ceremony (photos)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst day of filming for ?Land Under Heaven?, Ning Xueluo\u2019s handsome and rich boyfriend comes to visit\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCounting down the number of rich admirers for pretty rookie Ning Xi, red roses piled on the set on the first day of filming (inside photos)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The headlines were still rather normal at first, but towards the end, they got a little strange. Topics like \u201cNing Xi is being kept as a mistress\u201d, \u201cNing Xi\u2019s rich sponsor\u201d, \u201cNing Xi\u2019s cheating on how many men?\u201d, \u201cThe mess in Ning Xi\u2019s private life\u201d started appearing\u2026</p><br/><p>While on set, she had already been prepared, so she could stay rather calm upon seeing these.</p><br/><p>She knew that she would have gotten rumours like this sooner or later with an image like hers, even without Jiang Muye and YS\u2019s interference that day.</p><br/><p>The tabloids were sitting on the fence right now, since there wasn\u2019t any concrete evidence. What she was worried about was that people would start to believe the rumours if they were mentioned often enough, regardless of whether they were true or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need any help?\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s voice sounded by her ear.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hugged her notebook and sat up. Propping up her chin, she smiled and said, \u201cBig Boss Lu, are you going to get rid of all the online rumours for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lu Tingxiao passed her and Little Treasure a cup of milk each, \u201cYours is low-fat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Ning Xi was overwhelmed by the unexpected care, and took the cup carefully. She spoke up, \u201cThank you for your good intentions, but there\u2019s no need for that. I believe time will prove everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe in you.\u201d Lu Tingxiao said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was dazed for a moment before helplessly holding her forehead, \u201cLu Tingxiao, has anyone ever told you that you\u2019re really good at wheeling!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWheeling?\u201d Suspicion flashed across Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face, he clearly didn\u2019t know what this internet term meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 It means that you\u2019re good at coaxing girls to be happy!\u201d Ning Xi gave a simplified explanation.</p><br/><p>A smile rippled in Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes when he heard so, \u201cI\u2019m happy with your evaluation. Does this mean you were pleased by me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere turned pink.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s cheeks were burning in an instant. She was vexed at herself in her heart: who told you to have such a loose mouth! Your loose mouth led to such a dangerous topic!</p><br/><p>Luckily, Lu Tingxiao always knew when to step back, \u201cI\u2019m going to look at some documents in my study. Remember to rest early, both of you. Good night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cGood night~\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although little bun didn\u2019t say anything, his intentions were clearly written on his face: \u201cHurry up and go, don\u2019t disturb me and Auntie Xiao Xi~\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She sobbed with her shoulders trembling, \"Bastards! They're all inhumane! Of all places, they made me go to a haunted house! They also left me alone in a dark room! That h-house...it's the one with the rumors about a woman who hung herself there...it's so scary! I tried to leave...b-but I was out of strength... They must've tried to scare me to death\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not say anything. He was almost scared to death by her as well\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Can you please stay? I don't want to be alone! What if the female ghost followed me here?\" begged Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao knitted his eyebrows although he felt both slightly relieved and a little helpless against her request. \"I won't leave.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, are you sure?\" asked Ning Xi as she went to the cupboard and look for clothes to change into. She turned around and asked for confirmation.</p><br/><p>\"I'm sure.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi asked multiple times before she finally changed out of her clothes.</p><br/><p>When she was changing, she realized something tragic. The round tail at the back of the bunny outfit she loved had fallen off\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi grieved for the tail. She turned around and saw Lu Tingxiao acting like a gentleman and facing his back towards her.</p><br/><p>\"I'm done changing!\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\" Lu Tingxiao turned around and patted the girl's head. \"Rest well.\"</p><br/><p>\"Will you stay with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"How can I not stay with you?\" Lu Tingxiao sighed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was relieved.</p><br/><p>On the soft bed, the girl curled herself into the man's embrace, mostly because she was really terrified. She fell asleep pretty quickly.</p><br/><p>She did not seem to have a good rest though as she kept on frowning in her sleep and had beads of sweat on her forehead. Lu Tingxiao stayed right beside her and comforted her lightly\u2026</p><br/><p>At six in the morning, there were sounds of footsteps approaching.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked up. As expected, it was his son. He made a hand gesture and signaled him to be quiet. Ning Xi had only slept around 4 a.m. and if she woke up now, she would not get enough sleep.</p><br/><p>The little bun noticed his father's serious expression, so he did not mess around and only stood beside the bed to look at his mother.</p><br/><p>\"Your mother slept very late last night. Don't wake her up,\" said Lu Tingxiao in a low voice.</p><br/><p>The little bun nodded obediently. He left after a short while because he had school today and could not be late.</p><br/><p>Soon, the little bun returned to the bedroom with his writing board. He wrote a few words: [I'll share your burden.]</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was surprised.</p><br/><p>The child had probably noticed his odd expression and wanted him to share his worries.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled. \"Wait until you get a little older.\"</p><br/><p>Little Treasure pouted. He was trying really hard to grow up already. Furthermore, he had gained 2 kilograms of weight recently!</p><br/><p>Before he went to school, Little Treasure gave his mother a light kiss.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at the girl quietly, not giving into slumber, then he realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Her temperature...it was rising!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They even had guns on them.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Ning Xi was not afraid.</p><br/><p>On the left side of the car, there was a monster even scarier than cluster bombs.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Han Xiao sat in the passenger seat beside the driver, still chewing on a bit of the remaining fried drumstick.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you two big guys, bullying a lady. That\u2019s not too nice, is it?\u201d Han Xiao said as he looked towards the two men outside the car.</p><br/><p>When they heard him, the short and skinny man walked up and closed the passenger car door again. He stared coldly at Han Xiao. \u201cEat your food. Don\u2019t go seeking death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The orders that they had received were to take Ning Xi back with them. If Ning Xi did not cooperate, then they would resolve her quickly.</p><br/><p>As for any other people, it was not within their area of consideration.</p><br/><p>After Han Xiao finished eating the drumstick, he wiped the oil stains from the corner of his mouth and said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good. Want to have some?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao wound the car window down and looked the short, skinny man beside him.</p><br/><p>The short and skinny man had yet to come back to his senses as he asked subconsciously, \u201cHave what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll treat you to a drumstick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Han Xiao threw the chicken bones in his hand, and there was the vague sound of something slicing through the air.</p><br/><p>The drumstick bone was thrown right into the skinny, weak man\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 Ahh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The odd object got stuck in the short and skinny man\u2019s throat. He had only taken two breaths at the most when the man\u2019s face turned ashen and his eyes bulged. In the midst of his struggle, he made crying sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that yummy?\u201d When he saw the short, skinny man\u2019s incredibly pained expression, Han Xiao\u2019s eyes revealed a ruthlessness.</p><br/><p>Moments later, with the sound of a plop, the skinny, weak man had fallen hard onto the ground. His body twitched non-stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re looking for death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a situation made the chubby man\u2019s expression instantly change. He immediately whipped out a handgun from his waist and aimed it at Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>Before he could see how Han Xiao moved, there was a white flash and Han Xiao had already appeared by the chubby man\u2019s side, five of his lean fingers casually wrapped around the gun.</p><br/><p>The chubby man wanted to pull the trigger by reflex.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The chubby man\u2019s pupils suddenly shrunk. The trigger had long been blocked by this young man\u2019s fingers, and he could not shoot at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat rotten thing! Let me take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a flash, Han Xiao grabbed the gun from the chubby man\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw that the black gun muzzle had been turned on him, the chubby man\u2019s body trembled and he looked terrified.</p><br/><p>The two of them were well-trained assassins while this sissy who looked incredibly young contained a terrifying force that was beyond a human\u2019s understanding.</p><br/><p>With almost no means to retaliate, the tables had been completely turned in between the jokes of that man with the demonic charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis lousy toy, how do you use it? Is it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Before Han Xiao finished, a muffled noise came from the muzzle and the bullet shot through the chubby man\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh\u2026 Sorry, sorry, my hands are covered in oil. I made a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao stared at the chubby man who had fallen to the ground and smirked faintly.</p><br/><p>When she saw Han Xiao\u2019s expression, Ning Xi could not help but tremble too.</p><br/><p>To label him as a monster was not exaggerating at all.</p><br/><p>As a friend, he would bring you an extremely intense feeling of security.</p><br/><p>As an enemy\u2026</p><br/><p>She could not imagine.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Xiao, you show off! Why did you kill all of them?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi returned to her senses, the two men had already been killed by Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>It happened so quickly. Even if Ning Xi wanted to stop him, she was too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a show off? What does this have to do with me being a show-off? I\u2019m helping you kill them. It\u2019s not my arrogance that killed them.\u201d Han Xiao casually threw the gun to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi almost puked blood onto Han Xiao\u2019s face. What abilities of comprehension did this crazy person have? His language teacher must have died especially soon!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He then gently covered her eyes with it and tied it around her head again.</p><br/><p>The instant that Lu Tingxiao came closer, the fire inside Ning Xi unexpectedly flared up. She hurriedly chanted in her mind: \u201cEmptiness is form, form is emptiness.\u201d It was only when he had backed away to a safe distance and her sight had been covered that the uproar inside her body slowly calmed down.</p><br/><p>If it had been someone as disgusting and vulgar as Zhu Xiangcheng who had come, then it would have been fine. However, it just had to be Lu Tingxiao. She had been drugged with an aphrodisiac, and Lu Tingxiao was basically a catalyst who could increase the effect of the medicine infinitely, creating a reaction that could take a person\u2019s life away. </p><br/><p>\u201cIs it okay now?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded, \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I need to ask of you. I have no strength left in my body at all, could you help me get to the bathroom? I\u2019ll be fine after I soak in a cold water bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for a bit, I\u2019ll help you fill up the tub.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The distinct sound of the water splashing in the bathroom rang distinctly in the quiet room.</p><br/><p>Although she was as blind as before, this time, she felt a sense of ease and relief.</p><br/><p>After some time, the sound of the water stopped and footsteps could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you walk?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I can, just support me for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao reached out his arms to support her and even thoughtfully maintained a distance between them, only his arms were in contact with her.</p><br/><p>When her body was finally submerged in the icy water, Ning Xi gave a comfortable sigh, \u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression tensed up, \u201cI\u2019m leaving first. If you need anything, just call me. Don\u2019t soak for too long and be careful not to catch a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao turned and left. The back of his figure conveyed his urgency and a sense of escaping from a difficult situation.</p><br/><p>After leaving, Lu Tingxiao pulled open the room door, only to see a person crashing into the room because his support was gone.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli climbed up and dusted off his rear while trying to peek into the room. He coughed once before saying \u201cHeh heh\u2026 I was only worried for you guys\u2026 only worried\u2026 I definitely wasn\u2019t being a busybody\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked as if he had already been expecting him to be hiding by the door. With a cold tone, he spoke up, \u201cGo to the car and bring me the documents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli gaped until his mouth formed an O shape, \u201cBrother, are you sure? You can still look at documents in this kind of situation? Are you still a man!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes coldly swept over him, \u201cDo I need to prove it to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no no, no need! I\u2019m going now! Immediately!\u201d His brother would definitely prove it to him via a specially manly and violent beating.</p><br/><p>After he brought the documents over, Lu Jingli heard the sound of the water from inside. He then sighed and bitterly said, \u201cWhy soak in a cold water bath! Why don\u2019t you just offer yourself up as the antidote! What a waste! This is such a waste!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao : \u201cYou can leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t want to leave. Actually, I want to stay~ Stay and accompany you every season~~~\u201d Lu Jingli sang while reluctantly disappearing.</p><br/><p>After returning to the room, Lu Tingxiao tried hard to ignore the faint silhouette behind the frosted bathroom door and forced himself to concentrate on the document in his hands.</p><br/><p>Hm, he was pretty efficient\u2026 In 30 minutes, he actually managed to finish reading two pages\u2026</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that Ning Xi anxiously shouted from the bathroom, \u201cLu Tingxiao\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her grandfather had two sons but for some reason, it was difficult for both of them to bear a child, hence they did not have anyone to inherit their business\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, the female lead\u2019s mother became pregnant and the scan results said that it would be a boy!</p><br/><p>The family was overjoyed!</p><br/><p>What happened afterward was kind of predictable. After 9 months, the child turned out to be a girl!</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>The female lead\u2019s mother could not bear the self-blame and stress, so in addition to the father\u2019s intention for the child to inherit the family business, they decided to have their child cross-dress.</p><br/><p>She cross-dressed for twenty over years!</p><br/><p>One did not need to know how the female lead could keep her secret for so long. Nevertheless, dramas like this did not need logic to work.</p><br/><p>Anyway, this topic heightened Ning Xi\u2019s interest.</p><br/><p>Not just the cross-dressing part, the female lead\u2019s personality was also interesting as well...expert flirter, playful, loves excitement\u2026</p><br/><p>Now that she had looked at it thoroughly, it was a character tailor-made for her!</p><br/><p>The male lead\u2019s persona was not too bad as well. He was the assistant butler to the female lead, loyal and kind. He was hired by the female lead\u2019s grandfather to keep an eye on her, so the female lead hated him at first and pulled all kinds of pranks on him. It was during their time spent together that sparks were produced\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I Only Like You\"! This is it!</p><br/><p>After she had decided, she was so excited that she could not fall asleep. She went to see Ling Zhizhi in her office the first thing in the morning.</p><br/><p>\"Sis Zhizhi, I\u2019ve picked one!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Zhizhi looked at her in surprise, \"That\u2019s quick. Which one do you like?\"</p><br/><p>\"This one!\" Ning Xi handed the script to Ling Zhizhi like a piece of treasure.</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi took it and looked at it, \"'I Only Like You'...it sure seems like a hot topic, and it was adapted from a currently popular novel\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! This is it!\"</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi thought about it for a little, then analyzed, \"Are you sure that you want this? There isn't much invested into this project, only around 10 million dollars. Of course, it\u2019s not a small sum. When I picked this, I was thinking that it fits your current outlook and you seem like a good fit for a drama like this, but I didn\u2019t dare to just pick any drama because you might be easily labeled as another idol without real acting skills, and it\u2019d destroy your reputation you\u2019ve built from \"The World\". This is really a challenge to one\u2019s acting skills!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded, \"Sis Zhizhi, you\u2019re absolutely right!\"</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi looked at her, \"To be honest, I\u2019m a little surprised that you\u2019d pick this...with your looks, are you sure you can handle cross-dressing? If you can't manage it and acted too feminine, it would seem really fake and viewers might diss you. It might even become a failed project in the end; there were a lot of precedents in the past.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m sure, and I\u2019m confident! Do you want me to go back and change into a male outfit?\" Ning Xi was prepared to run back home.</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi smiled, \"It\u2019s alright, as long as you\u2019re confident, I have faith in you.\"</p><br/><p>Actually, in \"The World\", there was a small part in which Ning Xi acted as the general, and she had looked really cool and exuded a masculine aura. If she really cross-dressed, it might be difficult, but it was not entirely impossible.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was touched and she expressed her gratitude, \"Sis Zhizhi, I really love you! I\u2019ll contact the people from the Corporation now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, okay.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

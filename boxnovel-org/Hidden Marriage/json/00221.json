She\u2019s working hard with me (1-4 translations a day/per person) to bridge the gap between where we are now and the summaries so we can get this show on the road!</p><br/><p>So Basically, it\u2019s a count down from chapter 222 \u2013 236. Wish us luck as we count down!</p><br/><p>________________________________________________________________________________</p><br/><p>Late at night.</p><br/><p>When the girl\u2019s breathing evened out, the man\u2019s eyes finally opened. His eyes were like cold dark pools, no waves could be found.</p><br/><p>In the moonlight, he quietly watched to girl sleep tranquilly, then gently</p><br/><p>kissed her lips.</p><br/><p>From the first time he saw her, he wanted to keep her home, and lock her in the bedroom, where no one was allowed to go. He would let none one look at her, only he can see her, and she can only see him\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Even he himself was surprised, how he had endured till now.</p><br/><p>He then kissed her again, forcing her mouth open, entangling her tongue for so long until she frowned, almost waking up because she couldn\u2019t breathe\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A long while later, he stopped kissing her and stroked her cheek. Sighing, he said \u201cNing Xi, do not test my patience. I cant guarantee that I can endure for a long time\u2026\u2026can\u2019t guarantee\u2026what I would do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next morning.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t know when she fell asleep last night, but when she woke up Lu Ting Xiao was not in bed.</p><br/><p>Because she fell asleep late, it was almost nine o\u2019clock when she got up.</p><br/><p>On her phone, the call log shows a bunch of missed calls from Jiang Muye. On WeChat, he scolded her for standing him up.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi feeling he was being difficult messaged Jiang Muye to come over, then went to wash up before heading downstairs.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao had gone to work, and Little Treasure hadn\u2019t woke her up but was obediently sitting on the couch, reading.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, come here!\u201d Ning Xi said, beckoning to Little Treasure</p><br/><p>Little Treasure immediately put down his book, and toddled over (Deng deng deng).</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly held up the little guy, \u201cToday, Aunty will take you out to play okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Little Treasure heard this, his face was full of surprise but he nodded his head.</p><br/><p>At this time, a horn sounded by the door.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held Little Treasure and walked out the door. She was wearing pants, a cartoon print white t-shirt, and a shoulder bag that made her to look like a student.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Ning Xi said getting little treasure ready for the drive.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye stared at Little Treasure next to her, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re bringing this guy on our date?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glared at him, \u201cWho is going on a date with you! This was Little Treasure and mine\u2019s fall picnic, okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye just stares at her, \u201cThen why did you call me?\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s for your car! In my friends group, only you were free today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the Lu Group, both Lu Ting Xiao and Lu Jingli were both busy.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJiang Muye silently choked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo go, hurry up. We have to get there before the sun goes down.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Muye replied, \u201cAre you not afraid people will recognize you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I pretend a little bit, then there\u2019s no problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye glanced a her uncomfortably, before looking back at the road,</p><br/><p>\u201cPretend to be what? A family of three?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m the sister. Little Treasure is my brother. As to you\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to being the father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the driver!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just remembered, I also have to go to the supermarket! I need to buy meat to grill and drinks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s face was cloudy. He didn\u2019t know whether he should cry. This bastard, you\u2019re the worst!</p><br/><p>After visiting the supermarket, Ning Xi found an empty, scenic spot by a small river. She hummed happily to the side while teaching Little Treasure to set up the skewers.</p><br/><p>On the side, Jiang Muye is sitting by the water with a fishing rod, also singing. \u201cToday is a beautiful sunny day. But you came with your brother. When I saw his face, my mood immediately changed and my day became cloudy. It was as if you sprinkled salt on my wounds\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

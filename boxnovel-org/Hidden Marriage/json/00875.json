Lu Tingxiao asked in surprise, \"The person you rescued was Zhuang Zongren?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head. \"Yes, I only realized it after I sent him home and saw Zhuang Keer and Zhuang Liaoyuan...it seems like Zhuang Rongguang made a mess again and the elder heard about it from a phone call, which then caused him to have a heart attack! I was about to leave right away, but they insisted\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll go and get you tonight.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? It\u2019s alright, I drove here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you think I can leave you alone at Zhuang Liaoyuan\u2019s place?\" Lu Tingxiao\u2019s voice sounded cold.</p><br/><p>\"Uhh\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She remembered that Zhuang Liaoyuan had mentioned introducing guys to her\u2026</p><br/><p>Did the devil always hold grudges?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Dinner soon started.</p><br/><p>The table was a lavish spread of traditional Chinese dishes, but there was only Zhuang Zongren, Zhuang Liaoyuan, and Zhuang Keer.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve asked Aunty Zhang to make a few more dishes, I hope you like them!\" Zhuang Zongren kindly told her.</p><br/><p>\"They taste great!\" Ning Xi replied.</p><br/><p>\"Then, eat more! You\u2019re way too skinny!\" Zhuang Zongren said.</p><br/><p>\"Grandfather, she\u2019s an actress and she's got to be careful about her diet!\" Zhunag Keer interrupted.</p><br/><p>\"How can that be? It\u2019s bad for her health!\" Zhuang Zongren said, unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly butted in, \"It\u2019s alright, I don\u2019t stay on a diet and I just eat normally, I exercise quite a lot.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, that\u2019s right! Nothing\u2019s more important than keeping a body healthy!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m hungry! Really hungry! I want to eat! I want to eat! Can anyone hear me!? Are you guys starving me to death? Am I really your son?\" Another round of yelling came from the room.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi coughed lightly, feeling a little awkward.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Zongren did not bat an eye as he put some vegetables into Ning Xi\u2019s bowl. \"Just ignore him.\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer probably felt he was really overdoing it this time, so she ignored him as well.</p><br/><p>Zuang Liaoyuan pinched the space between his eyebrows and looked a little embarrassed. \"Sorry to let you see this...I can tame even the wildest soldier, but I can\u2019t even teach my own son!\"</p><br/><p>The atmosphere went a little stale when Zhuang Rongguang was mentioned.</p><br/><p>It was their family matter, so it was not Ning Xi\u2019s place to comment. She thought carefully about what to say when she saw Zhuang Liaoyuan\u2019s defeated expression. \"Teaching a kid is much more different than training a soldier, especially boys. They are usually in a rebellious phase at this age\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer sighed, \"He\u2019s really too much, he\u2019s only 18, but he's already started drinking, smoking, fighting, skipping classes, and even gambling. He always picks up all the bad habits. We\u2019ve tried all we can, but he just won't change\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t talk about him anymore, let\u2019s eat!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, let\u2019s eat! Try some fish, Little Girl Xi, it\u2019s really fresh\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As the dinner was about to finish, a soldier came by and whispered to Zhuang Liaoyuan. Zhuang Liaoyuan then looked at Ning Xi, then gave the soldier some instructions.</p><br/><p>A while later, there was the sound of familiar footsteps. Ning Xi turned around to see the soldier from earlier lead a man in; it was Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan looked at Lu Tingxiao and said coldly, \"Why are you in such a rush? Could I have eaten her up?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

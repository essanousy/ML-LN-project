However, this time, Ning Xi had an expression of bliss, and was even happily sending a text message.</p><br/><p>Each of them had their own lamentations:</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, these days, money alone isn\u2019t enough to get the beauty, you have to use your heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? Didn\u2019t you hear that girl say that it was handmade? How sweet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet the one that sent the fruit juice will win the girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll bet the one who sent the diamond!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone rooting for the one who sent the flowers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After finishing the fruit juices and green bean soup, Ning Xi was fired up and ready to continue working.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lu Tingxiao, who was taking a break from work and accompanying his son at home, got a notification on his phone with a \u2018ding\u2019.</p><br/><p>The notification indicated that there was a new message from Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao tapped on it, and the corners of his lips rose slightly.</p><br/><p>[Darling, thanks for your fruit juice and green bean soup, it was super super delicious! Sarang haeyo!]</p><br/><p>He looked at the message for a long while before waving his hand at his son, who was sitting unmoving at the window in a daze, \u201cLittle Treasure, come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure ignored him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao sighed lightly, \u201cThere\u2019s a message from your Auntie Xiao Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure scuttled over like a rocket, and even tried to grab the phone by jumping.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised the phone even higher, \u201cI\u2019ll let you see it if you call me daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure\u2019s expression was full of protest, indicating his refusal to cooperate.</p><br/><p>It was only when his son was anxious to the point of crying that Lu Tingxiao finally softened and passed the phone to him.</p><br/><p>While watching his son read the message, looking perfectly content, Lu Tingxiao had an expression of worry on his face.</p><br/><p>It was most likely because there were so few things that could trouble him, that God had sent Little Treasure to his side to test him.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was extremely intelligent. He could speak at 6 months, and although he had a taciturn personality, since that incident, he had never spoken again.</p><br/><p>He had missed out too much during Little Treasure\u2019s early years, and it was only when he wanted to make up for it that he found that it was much too late.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know when he would be able to hear his son call him daddy again\u2026</p><br/><p>Little Treasure stared at the phone for a long while. It seemed like there was something he couldn\u2019t understand. Finally, he moved closer to his daddy and pointed at \u2018Sarang haeyo\u2019 with his tiny little finger, most likely asking the meaning of those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a manner of speech, there\u2019s no special meaning to it.\u201d Lu Tingxiao answered seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2013 Oppa, don\u2019t teach Little Treasure when you\u2019re not familiar with pop culture! \u2018Sarang haeyo\u2019 means \u2018I love you\u2019 in Korean, okay!\u201d Lu Jingli was bouncing as he ran over, he even made a heart shape with his fingers.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure sent a scornful look to his dad after hearing so, then ran off with little steps to continue pressing fruit juice.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was fluent in 12 languages. Even if Ning Xi had written those words in Korean, he would definitely have recognised them. However, when the words were written as they were pronounced in Chinese, he could not understand it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to work?\u201d Lu Tingxiao looked coldly at Lu Jingli in askance, with the expression of a boss managing his subordinates.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli immediately moved a chair over to sit in front of him excitedly, \u201cBoss, I have something very important to report to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was lazy to speak, he had an expression of \u2018speak if you want to\u2019.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli gestured wildly with his hands as he spoke, extremely excited, \u201cDo you know what news I received today? Xiao Xi Xi\u2019s ardent admirers sent her presents while she was on set!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was the fruit juice and green bean soup that Little Treasure sent to her.\u201d Lu Tingxiao was indifferent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, but before our Little Treasure sent his gift, there were other people who sent her gifts too! Furthermore, there were two of them! One of them sent her enough roses to cover the set, while the other sent a huge 10 carat diamond!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression slowly turned cold. On this hot summer day, it helped to relieve the heat a little.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

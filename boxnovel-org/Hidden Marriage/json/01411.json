Confidently, he picked up his gun and aimed at the target.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>After three shots, the scores were displayed: 10 points, 10 points, 10 points.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her eyebrows in surprise. \"Not bad!\"</p><br/><p>\"Isn't it?!\" Zhuang Rongguang was so ecstatic that he could almost fly when he heard Ning Xi praise him. \"I told you that I'm talented! I just didn't want to learn before. Even I scare myself when I get serious!\"</p><br/><p>\"Idiot, getting all worked up because of some small accomplishment!\" Zhuang Liaoyuan chided with a stern face, but there was a hint of pride and comfort hiding in his harsh words. He looked at Ning Xi with a grateful gaze.</p><br/><p>It was all thanks to her that his son was like this today.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly greeted Zhuang Zongren and Zhuang Liaoyuan when she saw them. She beamed. \"Rongguang is doing well to be able to reach this level in such a short time!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang cheekily said, \"See, even Sis Xi said so! Sis Xi, ignore them! Let's continue!\"</p><br/><p>They continued for a while, then there was a childish voice calling, \"Mommy!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately put down the gun when she heard her baby's voice. She turned around joyously and held the little guy up. \"My dear son!\"</p><br/><p>The little guy smelled really good and felt really fluffy. Ning Xi did not want to let go of him at all.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhuang was surprised when he saw the little guy running towards Ning Xi and calling her \"Mommy\". He looked at Zhuang Liaoyuan in confusion. \"This child is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>As they were talking, solid footsteps came in. A man in a suit, who looked similar to the child Ning Xi was holding, came inside.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan did not have to say anything and Zhuang Zongren immediately understood. \"This is the grandchild of the Lu family?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Zhuang Liaoyuan put up yet another stern face when he saw Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was not married yet. They were just in a relationship, so how could his son call her his mother already?</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Elder Zhuang, Chief Zhuang,\" Lu Tingxiao greeted the both of them.</p><br/><p>He then called Little Treasure over, \"Greet them\"</p><br/><p>Little Treasure looked at Zhuang Liaoyuan, then at Zhuang Zongren. After a thoughtful pause, he greeted obediently, \"Hi, Uncle Zhuang. Hi, Grandpa Zhuang!\"</p><br/><p>The little guy looked really cute like a round bun. When he tilted his head and greeted them obediently, Zhuang Liaoyuan's expression softened and he nodded.</p><br/><p>He felt that something was different compared to when he last saw him at Elder Lu's dinner. The little guy now seemed much more active.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Zongren was looking at him lovingly. He extended his rough palm and patted his head. \"Good boy!\"</p><br/><p>Probably because he was already old and really liked children, he really took a liking to Little Treasure the moment they met.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

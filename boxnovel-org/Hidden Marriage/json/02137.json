I only need to stall you. When Baron\u2019s settled his matters, I\u2019d like to see how you get along alone!\u201d Han Wuying shouted coldly, transforming into a dark shadow and charging towards Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>The two of them instantly engaged in a battle.</p><br/><p>When Baron saw Han Xiao was being stalled, he immediately ordered, \u201cKill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The snipers who hid in the dark instantly aimed their barrels at Yun Shen, Lu Tingxiao, and the rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really thought this was your turf?\u201d Yun Shen\u2019s face had a cold smile.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was expressionless as always. His gaze fell to a certain dark corner.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, hundreds of people surged in from outside the resort and met head-on with the Rothschild family\u2019s forces.</p><br/><p>Baron was not afraid at all. He appeared confident with insufferably arrogance. \u201cIf the snipers that I arranged in hiding wanted to kill all of your people, it would\u2019ve only taken a few seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang and everyone else\u2019s gazes instantly searched around the hidden places, trying to find out the hiding spots of those snipers.</p><br/><p>However, how would the Rothschild family\u2019s professional ambush snipers be so easily found out?</p><br/><p>Those snipers were like a time bomb\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it\u2019s no use for regret now.\u201d Baron\u2019s smile tightened. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said that, a sigh came from not too far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen children grow up, they\u2019re ready to spread their wings.\u201d A white-haired elder started to walked towards the crowd.</p><br/><p>When they saw the elder, the Rothschild family\u2019s forces were stunned, including Baron.</p><br/><p>However, Ning Xi was the one who was most shocked. She looked at the elder and subconsciously blurted out, \u201cGrandfather Jace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi, long time no see.\u201d Jace looked gentle and loving with his smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026 Why? Why have you come?\u201d Baron\u2019s expression changed again.</p><br/><p>Father?!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned on the spot.</p><br/><p>Jace was unexpectedly\u2026 Baron\u2019s father\u2026</p><br/><p>Did that not mean\u2026 that Jace was the European King?!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was dumbfounded by this revelation.</p><br/><p>This feeling was close to finding out that the monk who swept the floor in a temple was actually a top-notch master.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaron, you\u2019ve disappointed me.\u201d Jace shook his head with the imposing manner of a leader, rendering Baron to involuntarily quiver slightly.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen and Lu Tingxiao exchanged a glance. They could understand what the European King was implying.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the person who wanted to swallow Asia whole was not the European King himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, hear me out. I\u2019m doing this\u2026\u201d Baron\u2019s forehead had layers and layers of cold sweat as he tried to explain himself.</p><br/><p>However, he could only speak halfway when he was interrupted by Jace\u2019s wave of hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe snipers who are in hiding, all of you, come out,\u201d ordered Jace coldly.</p><br/><p>Subsequently, the air was silent. There was no sound at all. Moments later, there were rustling sounds and a few people walked out.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, there were only three people!</p><br/><p>Jace frowned. There was no way these people would go against his orders. Where were the rest then?</p><br/><p>Jace pondered for a moment, then he suddenly understood. He looked at Lu Tingxiao and Yun Shen as he lamented, \u201cThe younger generations will surpass us in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>His son had meticulously arranged for everything, yet it had long been seen through by the other party and they had even ruined a huge chunk of his plans.</p><br/><p>Baron looked at the three remaining snipers, then at his father again. At this moment, he was at a complete loss.</p><br/><p><em>Damn it! Father has been so focused on his movie. He hadn\u2019t gotten involved with the clan matters for a long time, so how did he come to realize all of this?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cFather, if we annihilate Asia, we Rothschilds\u2026 will be even richer and more powerful,\u201d said Baron unwillingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the reason you\u2019ve disobeyed me behind my back?\u201d Jace scolded, \u201cIs it actually the Rothschild family getting stronger, or you, Baron, getting stronger yourself!?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

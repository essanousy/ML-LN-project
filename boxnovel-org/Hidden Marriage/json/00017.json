How could she have the time to go audition for the supporting female lead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it was strange too. I found out a few things about yesterday\u2019s audition for the lead female role after asking around. The judges had been preparing to leave when they saw Ning Xi by accident. They thought she was perfect for the role and just decided it right then and there. No wonder you were so wary of her, this Ning Xi is indeed too scheming. The auditions already ended but she was still able to sway the judges. Who knows which one she was trying to hook!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Li did not dare to say any more. Ning Xi\u2019s appearance was a killer weapon. It would not be a surprise to her at all if one of the judges had taken a fancy to her.</p><br/><p>She had initially been planning to carefully raise Ning Xi when she had signed her. Who knew that there would suddenly be a Ning Xueluo coming out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>On one side was a rookie without any connections. On the other side was a popular artiste with an important family background, the choice was clear. In a place like the entertainment circle, it wasn\u2019t just looks that mattered.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression was downcast, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not the lead, this movie is a huge production!\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyone listening to this would be able to tell that she did not want Ning Xi to get this role.</p><br/><p>Chang Li was a little troubled, \u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019ll be some trouble this time. The company has invested a lot of funds in this movie. The boss behind our company will surely be happy that both the lead and supporting female actresses came from our company. It would be fine if there were someone more suitable who could replace Ning Xi. Too bad no one passed the audition the last time. Now we don\u2019t have a reason to switch Ning Xi out\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo seemed to have thought of something and suddenly calmed down. Touching her perfectly manicured nails, she laughed once, \u201cForget about it, since she\u2019s raring to play the fox spirit, then just let her do it! Heh, a seductress that caused the downfall of a nation, this role suits her quite well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly received Chang Li\u2019s call informing her that her supporting lead role for?Land Under Heaven?had been decided, and that she should prepare.</p><br/><p>The movie?Land Under Heaven?featured the female lead used all kinds of good traits to help the male lead ascend to the throne.</p><br/><p>While the supporting female lead used all kinds of vile methods, making enemy of the society and being condemned. It ends with her finally being forced to jump a cliff by the female lead and brightening the hearts of people everywhere.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder Ning Xueluo was so generous as to let her have it with this kind of setting.</p><br/><p>There was still work she had to finish even though she had gotten the supporting lead for ?Land Under Heaven?. Ning Xi had to go to another filming, the role was that of a mistress who had stolen someone\u2019s husband. There was only a five minute scene left to film today. She would be surrounded by a crowd of people to get beaten violently for five minutes.</p><br/><p>In actuality, filming those five minutes took up two hours. The actors playing the crowd were inexperienced and their actions did not match their expressions. She had to be beaten repeatedly.</p><br/><p>Upon returning home, Ning Xi casually switched on the TV and laid on the sofa exhausted.</p><br/><p>She felt like she had forgotten something after lying down for a while.</p><br/><p>The TV was showing the news at this moment and a familiar silhouette appeared on the screen.</p><br/><p>That exceedingly beautiful face, those broad shoulders, narrow hips, long legs and a temperament that peaked a tall mountain. If it wasn\u2019t little bun\u2019s father Lu Tingxiao, then who could it be!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao seemed to be at a contract signing ceremony and was shaking hands with a few foreigners.</p><br/><p>The host was speaking excitedly as he introduced how the Lu Corporation had successfully signed a collaboration with the Italian DR brand and was entering the European market. Their stock value could double.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally remembered as she was watching, she forgot to call little bun!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Platinum Palace.</p><br/><p>The Lu parents had come back from overseas and the family of five were having a reunion over dinner.</p><br/><p>The Lu Corporation was finally going to settle an important contract that they had been discussing for three years. Old Master Lu was extremely happy and he praised Lu Tingxiao highly, even giving Lu Jingli a round of praise.</p><br/><p>However, the main point came up near the end.</p><br/><p>His words approximately meant along the lines of: Work is important, but his precious grandson is even more important!</p><br/><p>Old Master Lu: \u201cTingxiao, work is very important but you can\u2019t neglect Little Treasure. You\u2019ve already finished the busy period of work, so spend more time to accompany Little Treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Lu: \u201cFind someone to help you take care of Little Treasure if you really have no time! Little Treasure has already grown so much, you should also consider your personal problems!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Lu: \u201cYour mother is right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli subtly tossed his brother a look, our parents are starting to play this game again.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao focused on eating and not saying a single word.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was holding on to a phone without a single movement.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s a type of variant embroidery, also called \u2018Both Sides Shine\u2019. It\u2019s on the same material. Through the same embroidery process, images are embroidered on both sides with exactly the same outlines, and the images are equally delicate, both to be admired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Qu, then what is the double-sided three-folded embroidery that Gong Shangze mentioned?\u201d Someone asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>Qu Guanyang continued to explain, \u201cIn double-sided embroidery, there\u2019s still a relatively unknown type called the double-sided multi-colored embroidery. As the name goes, it means that on both sides, the same motif is embroidered, but the colors will be different.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, Qu Guanyang paused. His tone was slightly emotional as he said, \u201cExtremely few people know that there\u2019s still one more even more difficult embroidery technique, which is what designer Gong mentioned earlier: the double-sided three-fold embroidery!</p><br/><p>\u201cDouble-sided three-fold embroidery was invented on the foundation of the double-sided multi-colored technique. The embroidered product will have different shapes, different needlework, different colors on both sides. Then, both sides have different motifs, different needlework, and different coloring. Different design, different needles, different colors, thus called double-sided three-folded embroidery!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, is that so!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow magical! The fact that both sides can embroider different patterns at the same time!\u201d The crowd exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Everyone was immersed in the exquisite Chinese traditional technique that Qu Guanyang had just talked about.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qu Guanyang concluded, \u201cI\u2019ve taken a look earlier. The character designs for these six sets of clothes used the double-sided three-fold embroidery method. That means this part of the embroidery was definitely completed at the same time. There\u2019s no possibility of it being added on later on!\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant Qu Guanyang finished, everyone abruptly came to their senses. Their faces showed that they all suddenly realized something.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means that this embroidery was definitely done all at once. There\u2019s no possibility of it being tampered at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that David is lying?!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the corner across, David\u2019s expression had long already changed the moment Gong Shangze said the words \u201cdouble-sided three-fold embroidery\u201d. The moment when he heard Qu Guanyang\u2019s words, he was completely frozen there. He could not hold the calm on his face much longer and his forehead broke out in cold sweat which dripped onto the polished floor.</p><br/><p>Under more and more scrutiny, David did not care about his image anymore. He rolled up his sleeves and wiped the sweat off his forehead. His lips trembled as he said, \u201cAct-actually, these words were indeed embroidered by me! I like designer Gong\u2019s designs, so I\u2019ve just embroidered his name on to motivate myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right! It was like that!</p><br/><p>So what if his work had Gong Shangze\u2019s name?</p><br/><p>Whoever\u2019s name he embroidered on his work was up to him!</p><br/><p>When he heard David\u2019s defense, Qu Guanyang instantly sneered, \u201cDouble-sided three-fold embroidery is currently the highest level of skill in the world of embroidery. Even among the hundreds of thousands of lady embroiders in Su embroidery\u2019s homeland, State S, there are very few with such a skill. Since Director David said that this double-sided three-fold embroidery was done by you, how about you prove to us right here and now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Earlier, had he not been the one who said to Gong Shangze that he could prove on the spot that the embroidery was personally done by him?</p><br/><p>The instant Qu Guanyang finished, the last chord in David\u2019s head finally snapped. He looked defeated and could not stand straight anymore. His knees gave way as he fell to the ground\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

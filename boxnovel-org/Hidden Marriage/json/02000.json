Her singing went horribly, and she could not reach several of the high-pitched notes.</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou went back stage with a darkened expression. Just then, she heard people gossiping.</p><br/><p>\u201cGosh! Who gave Yin Youyou the courage to pick up singing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, there are so many news about artistes faking their singing recently. At least, she proved that she isn\u2019t faking it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You can do that too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not the main point, alright? Do you know what situation Yin Youyou is in now? Why did she use the public dressing area with us just now? Doesn\u2019t she have her own exclusive dressing room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I know! I heard that Xu Tao and Qin Shuang went to the wrong room. Yin Youyou picked on them and accused them of trying to take the dressing room by force. She even had people chase them out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, and then? How did it become Yin Youyou getting chased out instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female artiste who claimed to know all about it then continued, \u201cThen, Goddess Ning Xi arrived! What happened afterwards? You don\u2019t need me to spell it out, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi is really sweet. I heard she\u2019s very protective of artistes from the same company as her! Aside from Qin Shuang, I heard there are several others as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYin Youyou always acts arrogantly just because she\u2019s slightly more popular. It\u2019s karma! She always bullies the weak. She should go and fight Ning Xi then!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou was frustrated when she heard them. \u201cAre you guys done?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all shocked and quickly acted being busy as if nothing had happened. They were afraid of this emerging typhoon.</p><br/><p>The group convened together again after Yin Youyou stormed off angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think Yin Youyou will do? People who\u2019ve offended Yin Youyou before faced tragic consequences!\u201d Someone asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s Ning Xi! Ning Xi is on a whole different level than Yin Youyou! Look at how the TV station treats her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget that there\u2019s Han Zixuan above Yin Youyou too! Aren\u2019t they good friends? Even though Han Zixuan is usually selfish and self-centered, she takes special care of Yin Youyou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone rolled their eyes. \u201cHan Zixuan\u2019s being suppressed herself. She can\u2019t even hold up for her own!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a little too early to make a conclusion. Given Glory World\u2019s capability and Han Zixuan\u2019s popularity, I think there\u2019s still a chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At night, at a luxury superclub.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan and Ning Xueluo were sitting opposite each other at a table beside a small pond.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan looked frustrated and helpless. Han Zixuan asked her the most important question, \u201cVice President Ning, you\u2019ve been taking care of me and helping me out, but ever since you left, I really feel like I can\u2019t stay in the company anymore. When are you coming back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since Su Yan had taken over the company, she was being suppressed more and more. She could not just sit around and do nothing, which was why she had asked to meet Ning Xueluo tonight.</p><br/><p>Opposite her, Ning Xueluo listened to her pleas and shrugged helplessly. She sounded like she was having some unspeakable issues. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zixuan, I don\u2019t have any power now. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan\u2019s expression changed. \u201cVice President Ning, I don\u2019t understand. Why did you suddenly leave the company?\u201d</p></div></article></section><br/>\n</p></div>"}

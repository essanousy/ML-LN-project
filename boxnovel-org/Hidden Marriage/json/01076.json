She had so many exes, so he was just another on on the list.</p><br/><p>After she agreed, she decisively escaped the next day\u2026</p><br/><p>Thiat was the truth behind her one-day relationship with Yun Shen\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Lang did not know about Ning Xi\u2019s true story. \"So, from what I see now, your safety is definitely secured!\"</p><br/><p>He then sighed, \"Now you know why I need you to pay for my alcohol, don't you? I might lose a part of my salary soon!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at him in disbelief. \"Don't worry, you won\u2019t! Didn\u2019t you say that the best and most perfect weapon in the world is your body? So, please continue to train me! Who knows if he might go crazy and want to crush my bones? I have no one to rely on!\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, that\u2019s true, you still need me. I'm your Master!\" Tang Lang nodded.</p><br/><p>\"However, since you're not that useful and the fact that my safety is secured for now, your doubled salary has returned to the normal rate now!\" Ning Xi grinned.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! You profiteer! You think I won\u2019t go and get back my card from Tang Ye, huh?!\" Tang Lang howled.</p><br/><p>\"Heh, you can always try. No one\u2019s stopping you. But don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t remind you. The last time I was caught there, I saw First Senior Brother with several new scars on his arms! He must\u2019ve put himself through some devilish training! Compared to your half-assed training, I wonder if you\u2019ll be getting your card back or giving your life up?\"</p><br/><p>\"Little Junior Sister, I suddenly feel that your suggestion about my salary adjustment is appropriate!\" Tang Lang quickly changed his attitude.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Xinyan was impatient. The moment her proposal passed, she immediatley opened her store.</p><br/><p>On top of that, she organized a grand opening ceremony on the first day, inviting several popular celebrities over, and because of Lu Corporation backing her up, many socialites came over to support her.</p><br/><p>At the same time, outside of Spirit\u2019s store, Ning Xueluo and History\u2019s marketing manager stood somewhere near the store.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, it\u2019s here\u2026\" The manager pointed at Spirit\u2019s sign.</p><br/><p>History had a store in this complex as well, but the location was not as strategic as Spirit's. Their retailer was a general fashion retailer, and while they were not bad, their status and name could never beat Lu Corporation's.</p><br/><p>As he saw Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression darkened, the manager said, \"Boss, although Lu Xinyan has the name of Lu Corporation behind her, she\u2019s useless! All her previous businesses ended up losing money and her ex-partners were almost ruined by her, so her involvement with Spirit is Spirit\u2019s misfortune!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo did not seem happy about it. She did not care about their business at all. It was the fact that Spirit was able to attract people like Lu Xinyan.</p><br/><p>That meant that Spirit was just as popular as History\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo looked at the man beside her coldly. \"You cannot let Spirit continue to grow. Use whatever method you can!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

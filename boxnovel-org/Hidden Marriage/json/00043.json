You can bite me again to compare.\u201d Lu Tingxiao suggested, before offering his hand to her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi waved her hands, embarrassed, \u201cNo need, there is absolutely no need for that! I admit! I admit that I was the culprit! Although\u2026 what happened last night? I don\u2019t remember much after drinking, I only recall that I entered the restroom, and I can\u2019t remember anything after that\u2026 How did I get back here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou collapsed in the female restroom and I went in to carry you out. You refused to go with me and even bit me.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s answer was simple and concise.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stupefied, \u201cYou\u2026 You entered the female restroom\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She had really committed a huge sin! The evil demon king had sacrificed way too much\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why am I sleeping in a car?\u201d Ning Xi summoned enough courage to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you refused to part with your little darling.\u201d Lu Tingxiao emphasised the two words \u2018little darling\u2019 with a light tone.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glanced at the car she had idolised for so long, and immediately believed what Lu Tingxiao had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ve caused trouble for you!\u201d Ning Xi apologised weakly.</p><br/><p>She felt terribly embarrassed for having caused so much trouble when it was only the second night she was staying over.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not receive her words, but shot out a seemingly unrelated question, \u201cWhy did you drink so much last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ning Xi\u2019s expression turned solemn.</p><br/><p>Seeing her sudden change in expression, the sleeping beast in Lu Tingxiao\u2019s heart started to stir.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not have the habit of sharing her personal worries with others. However, it felt so terrible keeping it in her heart that she just had to share. She leaned bonelessly against her seat and turned her head upwards to look at the greenery above her head as she mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that my role as Meng Changge\u2026 is gone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Astonishment flashed across Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s only a small role as a supporting female lead, I know that you might not understand my feelings since you\u2019re a CEO. You don\u2019t know how hard I worked for this day, you don\u2019t know how happy I was to get this role\u2026 All of you don\u2019t know\u2026 \u201c As she was talking, Ning Xi suddenly raised a hand to cover her eyes.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had assumed that she had lost control over Su Yan and had never thought that the cause would be something else.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t upset over Su Yan. Instead, she was upset because she had lost that role?</p><br/><p>The gloom he had been feeling the whole night dissipated in an instant. However, seeing how upset the girl was, his heart clenched in sympathy.</p><br/><p>How could he not know how important her dream was to her?</p><br/><p>Otherwise, why would she have continued stubbornly climbing upwards step by step despite knowing that there were shortcuts she could have taken?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad, you\u2019ve already done very well.\u201d Lu Tingxiao shifted the girl\u2019s head to rest against his chest.</p><br/><p>So the culprit wasn\u2019t Su Yan, but\u2026 Ning Yaohua.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua was the biggest sponsor for the movie?Land Under Heaven?, and he had the right to decide the cast in the end.</p><br/><p>No one was allowed to bully his girl, not even her own father.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

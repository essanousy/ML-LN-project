Even Little Treasure was involved.</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d Little Treasure dashed over when he saw a familiar figure by the entrance.</p><br/><p>The little guy would usually pounce onto Ning Xi for a hug. However, he stopped several steps away from her out of consideration for the baby in his mother. He stared at Ning Xi\u2019s stomach earnestly. \u201cMommy, is there\u2026 really a sister inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi chuckled. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sister or a brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll like it as long as it\u2019s Mommy\u2019s child!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Yan Ruyi, Lu Chongshan, and the other elders such as Jiang Muye\u2019s mother all came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi\u2019s back! Come in, be careful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Moments after Ning Xi went into the house, a military Jeep swiftly parked outside the entrance of the Lu residence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the Lu family is very reliable. There was no prior preparation for Xiao Xi\u2019s pregnancy. Just how dangerous was the situation today? If Xiao Xi got injured\u2026\u201d As Meng Linlang was complaining, she then noticed that everything around the Lu family\u2019s home was padded with soft mats. Even the chairs and tables were covered with a layer of leather.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan coughed lightly. \u201cXiao Xi only received her results today. The news was probably leaked before she could tell anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking so much. I want to see how Xiao Xi is now!\u201d Zhuang Zongren urged.</p><br/><p>The two families gathered in the living room.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you feel terribly unwell?\u201d Meng Linlang was worried when she saw Ning Xi looking rather pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright. I\u2019m feeling much better now. The nausea comes in short waves!\u201d Ning Xi had a headache when she saw so many people in the house. She was just pregnant. Everyone was simply too tensed!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked over to Lu Tingxiao for help. However, it was obvious that Lu Tingxiao was on their side.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi is even having her second child now, so when is the Lu family arranging the wedding?\u201d Zhuang Zongren grumbled.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruyi quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve been preparing for it since a year ago. Everything is already done and can be arranged anytime. Xiao Xi doesn\u2019t have to worry about anything. As long as her work is alright, we can have the wedding anytime she says so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Zongren\u2019s expression softened when he heard Yan Ruyi\u2019s words. \u201cWhat do you think, Xiao Xi? Your wedding can\u2019t be delayed any further! If anyone dares to say anything about it, I\u2019ll have a word with them myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Grandfather. My company will deal with it. Actually, I\u2019ve been preparing to announce it to the public. It\u2019s just that a little accident happened today, but it\u2019s fine. Why don\u2019t we make it next month?\u2019</p><br/><p>Meng Linlang thought about it. \u201cNext month is fine. Have your wedding before the new year. If it\u2019s delayed further, your pregnant belly will make you more uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruyi was immensely glad. \u201cI\u2019ve checked the calendar. The eighth of the next month is a good day! What do you both think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as Xiao Xi is fine with it,\u201d Lu Tingxiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I don\u2019t have a problem with it,\u201d replied Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s decided then!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, in the backyard of the Lu residence.</p><br/><p>A little koi fish was squatting on the stone staircase. He slung his arm over a certain blondie who was beside him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just torture anymore. It\u2019s a massacre! I want to run away from home. Do you want to join me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Second Uncle,\u201d replied Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Lu Jingli was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already booked my flight ticket.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was speechless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

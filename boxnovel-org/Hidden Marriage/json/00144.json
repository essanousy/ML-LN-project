He lived right next to my house, and he stayed for seven years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first time we met, I just happened to bump into him when his illness was acting up, so I helped to carry him all the way home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLater on, we slowly got more familiar with each other. The more we got to know each other, the more we fell in love. Childhood sweethearts, innocent playmates; what beautiful words! Heh. However, later on, reality told me\u2026 that this wasn\u2019t a Cinderella story, but a story about the Wolf of Zhongshan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be upset, he\u2019s not fit to match you.\u201d Lu Tingxiao consoled her.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t expected that she would unconsciously start talking about her ex-boyfriend with Lu Tingxiao. Ning Xi scratched her head and said in embarrassment, \u201cWe\u2019re a little off topic, let\u2019s continue talking about the Ning family\u2026 Because Ning Yaohua and Zhuang Lingyu couldn\u2019t bear to let go of the daughter they had raised for 18 years, after demanding to have me back, they didn\u2019t return Ning Xueluo to the Tang family. Ning Xueluo remained as their beloved daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be able to imagine what happened next. The distance caused by a separation of 18 years wasn\u2019t something that could be fixed in a single day. In front of Ning Xueluo, who had been raised under elite education for 18 years, I was an extremely unsophisticated little village girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was too naive back then, and treated her as a friend from the start. She used my trust to trick me into thinking that the lemon water used to rinse hands was a drink, and sent me a counterfeit dress to wear at the banquet. Using these little tricks, she slowly pushed me away from the Ning family and away from upper-class society\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose people were already used to mixing around with Ning Xueluo and were on her side. On the surface, they treated me as friends, but in private, they would mock me for being a village bumpkin. Even my biological parents hated my existence and felt that I was a stain on their reputations\u2026 After that, there was Su Yan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Su Yan, the most important things for a girl were all trampled on and destroyed: her chastity, her reputation and her dignity.</p><br/><p>Bit by bit, Ning Xi started hugging her knees, \u201cToday on set, something went wrong with the props. My sword hurt Ning Xueluo by accident. In the hospital, my mother\u2026 my biological mother slapped me without even asking about what had happened. My biological father only criticised and blamed me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gazed out the window at the inky black night. She continued with an airy tone, \u201cBack then, for some reason, the tension I had been holding back for five years just snapped. I suddenly felt that there was no meaning in living, I felt that I was a failure in life. Was it because I just wasn\u2019t good enough that everyone hated me? I had worked so hard for so long, but there was no meaning to it in the end\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after she had just finished speaking, Lu Tingxiao suddenly pulled her shoulders towards him with some force, \u201cNing Xi, look at me. Not everyone hates you. They\u2019re the ones who aren\u2019t good enough. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes turned slightly red.</p><br/><p>Even if she had always been acting heartless, like she didn\u2019t care, she was still a young lady who was only twenty or so.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao drew her into his embrace and kissed the top of her head gently\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt something heavy press on the top of her head, but didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stared at her with an extremely serious gaze, \u201cNing Xi, if you doubt yourself, then you should try to believe me. You\u2019re great.\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no one better than you in this world.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s sadness turned into joy, \u201cOf course I believe in Big Boss Lu\u2019s words!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao relaxed. That completely disheartened look in her eyes just now had caused him to panic badly for an instant.</p><br/><p>After staying silent for a moment, Lu Tingxiao took the initiative to ask, \u201cNing Xi, can I ask you a question?\u201d</p><br/><p>TL Note:</p><br/><p>The Wolf of Zhongshan is a story about creatures sticking to their true natures. In this case, a kind scholar saved a wolf that was being hunted. However, it tried to eat the scholar once the danger had passed.

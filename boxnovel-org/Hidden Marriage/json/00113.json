He only stood there silently, waiting patiently for her reply.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a deep breath. She turned to look at the man next to her before finally making her decision. She said: \u201cLu Tingxiao, I\u2019ve thought through everything you\u2019ve said. I promise that I\u2019ll stay for another three months. However, once the three months are over, I really have to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though there was nothing between them, it was suspicious to stay in someone else\u2019s home as an unmarried woman. It could easily cause unnecessary misunderstandings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Lu Tingxiao showed an expression of relief. At the same time, a well-hidden dark glint flashed across his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have filming tomorrow?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi heaved a long sigh before nodding, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her uneasy expression, Lu Tingxiao asked caringly, \u201cWhy? Are the scenes for tomorrow difficult to act?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi propped up her chin and leaned on the railing before muttering to herself, \u201cThey\u2019re not exactly difficult, and it\u2019s just a kissing scene, but the person I have to kiss is Jiang Muye. I\u2019m just worried that I\u2019ll forget myself and hit him halfway. What will I do then? I might even turn it into a gag scene instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKissing scene\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. Although he had already known that this movie would have scenes like that, he had been avoiding that issue on purpose, because he was worried that he would lose control and do something to make her hate him.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ning Xi suddenly thought of something. She hit her own head and said, \u201cAh right, Lu Tingxiao, there\u2019s something\u2026 I need to thank you for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked a little absent-mindedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just found out that the person who added that last minute investment into the movie was Second Master Lu, and it was you who gave the order to keep me as the second female lead. Thanks for that.\u201d Ning Xi thanked him sincerely and with utmost gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good enough that you don\u2019t blame me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I that undiscriminating? I\u2019ll definitely express my gratitude for things that I should be thankful for!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, it was just a convenient action.\u201d The truth was that he had done all this for her, and Jiang Muye was the one who had really benefited from it in passing.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought hard before she spoke up, \u201cI\u2019ve already taken advantage even in passing. Just saying thanks isn\u2019t enough to show my sincerity. Why don\u2019t I cook a meal for you and Little Treasure when I\u2019m free later on? Although I\u2019m usually too lazy to cook for myself, my cooking is really delicious! Let me tell you, if I didn\u2019t enter the entertainment industry, I might have gone to become a chef!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled lightly, \u201cI look forward to it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had just arrived at the movie city when she spotted a large group of ladies gathered near the set, with a particularly eye-catching golden head in the middle of the group. At one glance, she could tell that it was Jiang Muye and his young female fans.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi subconsciously thought of taking a detour. She didn\u2019t think that there would be a scream just as she was about to sneak away: \u201cAh! It\u2019s Ning Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>In her heart, Ning Xi thought that she was done for, but just as she was about to defend her face, the group of girls lined up into a few rows in front of her and bent at their waists together as they said, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>After they had finished apologising, they stared at her with starry eyes as all of them talked at once:</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning Xi, sorry, it was our misunderstanding the last time! Please don\u2019t take people like us seriously, you have to continue acting the character Meng Changge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! Your acting\u2019s just too good, we really love the scene you had with Jiang Muye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI played that 10 second clip on repeat at home for a whole day, okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was so bewildered by the girls\u2019 actions that she subconsciously turned to look at Jiang Muye.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

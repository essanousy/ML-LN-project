I did, but not anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what was it?\u201d Tang Lang was speechless. Was she pranking him?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been unsafe recently after the assassins attacked the night before yesterday, so I was thinking of asking you to stay over,\u201d Ning Xi explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cAssassins\u2026\u201d Tang Lang then glanced over at Han Xiao who was nearby.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang\u2019s heart jumped. \u201cWhat the heck!? Why is he here? Is he the assassin?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him. \u201cI invited the Master here to protect me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was relieved.</p><br/><p>If this guy was the assassin, probably no one could escape. Their existence was practically bug-like.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already found someone. Why do you need me then?!\u201d Tang Lang was shocked. He wished he was at home indulging in watermelon under this hot summer!</p><br/><p>\u201cKiddo, come here and play with me.\u201d Suddenly, Han Xiao stretched his back and asked Tang Lang to go over.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi then smiled. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re going to be useful her, Second Senior Brother. Go have some fun with the Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Ning Xiao Xi, you sold me out again! No way!\u201d Tang Lang shook his head.</p><br/><p>What kind of joke was this!?</p><br/><p>He could not even get near Han Xiao when he attacked together with Tang Ye!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 If you don\u2019t come, I\u2019ll punch you to death.\u201d Han Xiao sounded really bored.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang\u2019s expression said that he did not want to fight even if he were to die.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on now. I\u2019ll just use a finger to fight you.\u201d Han Xiao smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Suddenly, there was a glimmer in Tang Lang\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>That was too much!</p><br/><p>One finger?!</p><br/><p>Who was he talking to?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, I\u2019ll fight you with one finger.\u201d Han Xiao extended just a finger of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Senior Brother, do you mean you can\u2019t even beat a finger?\u201d Ning Xi sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke!\u201d Tang Lang was enraged. \u201cAlright, one finger it is then! If I can\u2019t even beat one finger, I\u2019ll call you my grandfather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang then sank into his stance and charged towards Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao remained stationads as he put his left hand behind his back and faced the attack with just a finger.</p><br/><p>As Tang Lang closed in just half a step away, Han Xiao thrusted his finger mid-air.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>An airstrike-like sound echoed through the house.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao\u2019s thrust emitted a strong wind.</p><br/><p>Before his finger could eve emitted Tang Lang, the force generated from his finger impacted the man first.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao\u2019s speed was so swift that not only Ning Xi could not see it; even Tang Lang was not able to detect his movements clearly.</p><br/><p>In that brief moment, his finger landed on Tang Lang\u2019s abdomen.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Before even realizing what happened, Tang Lang was already on the ground.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang\u2019s expression looked horrible. He stared at the lazy-looking Han Xiao unbelievably.</p><br/><p>This man had just casually pointed at him, but he had not been able to do anything against it\u2026</p><br/><p>If this man had actually tried, could Tang Lang be dead by now?</p><br/><p>Tang Lang had always been talented in martial arts, and he was very proud of it.</p><br/><p>However, there were always more skilled people, and he was impressed.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang tried to comfort himself that he was still a normal person, and that he should not compare himself to this monster!</p></div>\n</div>"}

You\u2019ve certainly made me wait for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, she shot a funny look at the stern man walking next to Ning Xi. \u201cWho is this? Don\u2019t you know that you\u2019re not allowed to bring outsiders into the company as you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gave Chang Li a sideways glance, \u201cMy lawyer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh! You even have a lawyer!\u201d Chang Li assumed that Ning Xi had just casually hired one for appearances\u2019 sake, so she snorted disdainfully. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re still being unreasonable and putting on airs in front of me even though we\u2019ve reached this point. Haven\u2019t you realised how big a mess you\u2019ve made this time around? If I hadn\u2019t kept pleading with the company to go easy on you, you would have been cut loose long ago!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised an eyebrow and laughed lightly, \u201cHeh, you pled on my behalf? I\u2019d like to know what resulted from your pleas. Chang-jie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Li threw a document at her, \u201cThe company will hold a press conference soon. As long as you issue a public apology at the press conference and voluntarily withdraw from the cast of \u300aLand Under Heaven\u300b, Xueluo is generously willing to drop any legal action against you and give you a chance to turn over a new leaf. However, even if I try to guarantee your good behaviour from now on, there probably won\u2019t be any production that would dare to use an actress with such a wicked character.\u201d</p><br/><p>After threatening her with the stick, Chang Li then switched gears to give her the carrot. Wearing an earnest expression, she spoke, \u201cDon\u2019t lose heart. The company won\u2019t cast you aside if you truly repent. You should know that some directors don\u2019t care about scandals. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ve already accepted another role on your behalf. As long as you cooperate, there\u2019s a chance that you\u2019ll be able to make a comeback!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at her with a faint smile and spoke softly, \u201cA big production huh\u2026 I wonder which project Chang-jie has accepted on my behalf?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ning Xi had taken the bait, Chang Li sneered at her before replying. \u201cWhat, are you scared that I\u2019ll screw you over? You must have heard of \u300aBlooming Like It\u2019s Spring\u300b before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s finger tapped idly against the armrest, \u201cJiang Penghai\u2019s new project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s by Director Jiang! You should know that every single one of Director Jiang\u2019s movies has become a box office hit. When he was making movies in Hong Kong, Guo Qisheng wasn\u2019t even on the radar yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi almost couldn\u2019t resist the urge to laugh out loud while listening to Chang Li\u2019s earnest praise for Jiang Penghai. A sharp glint suddenly flashed through her eyes, \u201cChang-jie, if you want me to sell myself, you can just tell it to me straight! There\u2019s no need to beat around the bush!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Penghai had started his career by shooting pornography. Later on, he had tried to clean up his image but he wasn\u2019t very successful. The part that most people took issue with was Jiang Penghai\u2019s behaviour.</p><br/><p>This guy was extremely lecherous and he had slept with almost all of the actresses who starred in his productions. Last year, he had almost been taken to court because he had relations with a minor.</p><br/><p>She really had to thank them for going the extra mile to find a role like this for her. It must have been a lot of trouble finding a big production with such an illustrious director at the helm.</p><br/><p>Chang Li frowned after hearing Ning Xi speak, \u201cWhat do you mean, I want you to sell yourself?! Isn\u2019t the rating just a little more on the mature side?! What, you\u2019re not willing to do it? If not for my recommendation, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be willing to take in trash like you! Just think about how much of a loss you\u2019ve caused the company this time around! Are you thinking of freeloading off the company if you can\u2019t land any roles?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I won\u2019t be accepting this role.\u201d Ning Xi didn\u2019t feel like listening to Chang Li as she continued to reach new lows, so she simply stated her refusal outright.</p><br/><p>Chang Li flared up on the spot and slammed the table with force, \u201cNing Xi, you\u2019ve been disobeying me time and time again! Are you so stuck up that you won\u2019t even listen to your manager anymore? I\u2019m telling you now, you\u2019re going to act in Director Jiang\u2019s movie, even if you don\u2019t want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy manager?\u201d Ning Xi sneered, \u201cThat\u2019s a title you won\u2019t be holding any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you\u2019re still trying to change managers? You\u2019ll have to see if anyone in Starlight is brave enough to take you on!\u201d Chang Li said fearlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I want to change is the company.\u201d</p><br/><p>TL Note: Please read this announcement about the future of HM: http://volarenovels.com/announcement-eewc-hm/</p><br/>\n</div>"}

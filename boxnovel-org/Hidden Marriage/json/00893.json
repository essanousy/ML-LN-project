He sighed, then mumbled to himself, \"I wonder what the director was thinking. He asked a female to act as a guy. What if she was too feminine? Can this really be popular?\"</p><br/><p>This was his first movie after all and it would affect his career.</p><br/><p>It was true that Chen Mian had brought a lot of artistes to fame before, especially in his classic, \"Star, Moon, Sun\". Even the supporting characters became popular, but times changed and it was a fact that Chen Mian\u2019s performance was not as good as before. Moreover, the investment in this movie was really low\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh well, he was just a newbie. It was good enough to have a chance to act, and even work with a renowned director like Chen Mian. For the other future jobs, he would have to rely on luck! The entertainment industry relied on luck a lot anyway\u2026</p><br/><p>A short while later, the female tertiary character, Ji Yumeng, arrived as well.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! She's so pretty!\" Qi Fang commented as he saw her.</p><br/><p>Chen Hanchen took a peek.</p><br/><p>Ji Yumen was really pretty and she carried a cute and active personality, so she could easily make guys fall for her. However, she now looked really unhappy as she walked briskly and angrily with her manager following her behind, trying to convince her\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I already said that I don\u2019t want to play the tertiary role here. If even Ning Xi can become the female lead, why can\u2019t I?\"</p><br/><p>\"Please keep your voice down, my dear. We\u2019re not at home now. Are you trying to let everyone hear what you say?\"</p><br/><p>\"So what if they hear me? I\u2019m here to tell them that I\u2019m dissatisfied! I saw a video online about how Chen Mian publicly defended that woman. I wonder how she got her role this time!\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up! Be careful when you\u2019re talking in public. I\u2019ve told you many times! Don\u2019t talk about others. Don\u2019t you know about your own condition? You definitely can\u2019t handle the female lead role, you\u2019re not even qualified for the secondary lead, so this is best that you can do now! Do you think it\u2019s that easy taking on the female lead role? Of course, it\u2019s great if you can act it well. Otherwise, it\u2019ll become a black spot in your career\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ji Yumeng suppressed her anger after being scolded by her manager, but her expression softened when she saw two handsome guys sitting nearby.</p><br/><p>Any girl her age would be happy if she was on the same crew as these handsome guys!</p><br/><p>Ji Yumeng went over and greeted them, \"Hello, I\u2019m Ji Yumeng.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hello, I\u2019m Qi Fang!\"</p><br/><p>\"Chen Hanchen.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chen Hanchen...I've heard about you before! I heard you\u2019re the best looking guy in the Film Academy, aren't you? Nice to meet you! Qi Fang, you\u2019re the one who played the bass in the band JOY, aren't you? I've got a friend who really likes you, she thinks that you\u2019re really cute!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha, I\u2019ve always been labeled as 'cute'. Why has no one ever said that I\u2019m cool? Beauty Ji, you\u2019re pretty great yourself. I heard that you entered the Film Academy with top grades!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ji Yumeng was a pretty pleasant person to be with when she was not angry. With the addition of the cheerful Ji Yumeng to the trio of youngsters, they got along very well.</p><br/><p>\"It seems like Director Chen is going to use our extraordinary faces to support this movie!\" Qi Fang said.</p><br/><p>Ji Yumeng pouted, \"I\u2019m afraid that I can\u2019t act well! Even if it\u2019s cross-dressing, she\u2019s still a woman and they're asking me to be charmed by a woman. How difficult is that?! I even have to sit on her lap in the scene today...oh my God, I\u2019m getting goosebumps already!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

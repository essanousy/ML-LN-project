Upon seeing Ning Xi, he said with a respectful expression: \u201cMiss Xi, you\u2019ve returned. Little Young Master is drawing in the garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s drawing? Then I won\u2019t disturb him for now. Where\u2019s Mr Lu then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Young Master is upstairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, thanks!\u201d Ning Xi happily headed upstairs.</p><br/><p>The old butler looked at the girl\u2019s lively figure with a complicated heart. In the time they had spent together, no matter how guarded he had been, he couldn\u2019t resist having a favourable impression of this young lady.</p><br/><p>She was beautiful and had a sweet tongue. It was easy for her to get into everyone\u2019s good graces. What was hard to come by was her understanding of proper behaviour. She had never shown any attempts to step over the lines with Eldest Young Master. Actually, she didn\u2019t really care much about her image at most times.</p><br/><p>It was easy to tell when a woman had intentions towards a man. They might be able to hide it for a day or two, but with enough time, it would eventually be revealed.</p><br/><p>Similarly, it was easy to tell when a man had intentions towards a woman.</p><br/><p>Others might not know it, but he had seen everything from start to finish, so he was clear about it. Eldest Young Master had clearly taken a liking to this lady. The guest room she was staying had been personally designed by Eldest Young Master. Even the bedsheets, curtains and the closet full of clothes and accessories had all been personally picked by him. Not only that, on the first day she had arrived, he had already passed the list of her preferred foods to the kitchen. Every time she returned late, they had to leave some food for her. There were countless other details that he couldn\u2019t even finish mentioning\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if she was Little Young Master\u2019s saviour, Eldest Young Master\u2019s meticulous actions were a little too much.</p><br/><p>As long as the little lady came from a good family and could get along with Eldest Young Master, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a bad thing. Ever since the lady had moved in, Eldest Young Master had become more lively, and even Little Young Master was becoming more cheerful. Since he had watched Eldest Young Master and Little Young Master grow up, he was naturally happy about these developments.</p><br/><p>Right now, he wasn\u2019t worrying about Ning Xi harbouring bad intentions; he was actually more worried that Ning Xi didn\u2019t harbour any intentions at all.</p><br/><p>After heading upstairs, Ning Xi was impatient to share her spoils of war, so she directly opened the door to Lu Tingxiao\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she opened the door, her vision was filled with bared skin. Lu Tingxiao\u2019s hair was wet and he wasn\u2019t wearing anything on the upper half of his body. A white towel was wrapped around his waist, and water droplets slowly travelled down his tight abs, dripping down\u2026</p><br/><p>This scene was hard to turn your eyes away from, so Ning Xi\u2019s first reaction wasn\u2019t to close her eyes, but to widen them.</p><br/><p>Although she had some trauma towards men, it didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t appreciate beauty.</p><br/><p>It was most likely because she had suffered a huge shock after getting betrayed back then. She didn\u2019t know when she had started turning bent. Five years ago, she had been so conservative that she would blush upon seeing a man in a tank top and underwear. She didn\u2019t talk much with other men apart from Su Yan, and didn\u2019t even bat an eye no matter how handsome the man was\u2026</p><br/><p>A whole five seconds passed before Ning Xi regained her senses. She turned around with a whoosh and covered her eyes with her hands full of paper bags, \u201cSorry sorry, I forgot to knock!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao chuckled lowly, his voice somewhat hoarse, \u201cIt\u2019s my bad, I forgot to lock the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually he hadn\u2019t forgotten to lock it, but ever since she had moved in, he had never locked his door again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you looking for me? Wait a moment, I\u2019ll put on some clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>That short yet long look from the girl had lighted up his skin inch by inch. Luckily she had turned around in time, or his facade might have cracked thanks to the reaction he couldn\u2019t control from a certain part of his body.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was about to open the closet to get some clothes when Ning Xi shouted from behind him, \u201cAh, no! Don\u2019t put on your clothes!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

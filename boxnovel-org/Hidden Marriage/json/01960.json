He leaped out of his bed to see a large shadow outside the window engulf him.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was intimidated when he saw the large white tiger, especially with its cold eyes.</p><br/><p>The white tiger roared again at the terrified Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro! Sister-in-law! It\u2019s a ghost! No\u2026 It\u2019s a tiger\u2026 A living tiger\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli did not even bother with his shorts. He sprinted out of the bedroom and ran upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The roar just now was strong enough to crack rocks, summoning the survival instinct of fear in anyone. A fear of being below it in the food chain.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, Sister-in-law, huge problem, huge problem!\u201d Lu Jingli kept on yelling as he reached the second floor.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi were already outside their room.</p><br/><p>The roar was too loud for them to ignore it, and they had not fallen asleep anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a tiger roar alright. The beast should be around here. Could it really be a tiger that escaped from the zoo?\u201d Ning Xi thought it was weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cAround? It\u2019s right outside my window!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was still terrified. He almost pissed himself when he saw the huge white tiger outside his window earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo over and have a look,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, it\u2019s a tiger. Do you think it\u2019s a monkey?! Don\u2019t you remember that your brother, I, almost got eaten by a tiger when I was little?\u201d Lu Jingli clung to Lu Tingxiao like an octopus.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stared at him. \u201cGet off me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli said pitifully.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi followed behind Lu Tingxiao as the three of them went into the guest room.</p><br/><p>The moonlight was hazy that night. A huge white tiger appeared before the effulgence.</p><br/><p>\u201cA white tiger\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao frowned. How could there be a white tiger in Imperial?</p><br/><p>\u201cGhost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lu Jingli focused on the back of the tiger and goosebumps rose all over him.</p><br/><p>It was really a ghost this time!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shivered as well.</p><br/><p>A white tiger appeared outside her house at midnight was already creepy enough, then Lu Jingli had to suddenly spout this word from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was never scared of anything except ghosts\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a person.\u201d Lu Tingxiao quickly comforted the girl. He looked at the back of the tiger and noticed a human figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, a person on the back of a white tiger? Are you kidding me? It must be a ghost!\u201d Lu Jingli mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is it?\u201d Ning Xi frowned.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao went closer and finally saw who it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Xiao,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ning Xi thought she misheard him.</p><br/><p>What did her darling say just now?</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Xiao,\u201d repeated Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was shocked when she finally took a good look at the young man on the white tiger\u2019s back. Her mind went blank.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was currently unconscious and had several visible wounds on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true\u2026 He\u2019s Han Xiao, the super martial arts master!\u201d Lu Jingli\u2019s mouth gaped open wide.</p><br/><p>Every man had a fantasy within him.</p><br/><p>In video games or martial arts books with knives and swords, one would fantasize about excelling in martial arts in real life.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had been looking forward to meeting Han Xiao after he found out about his existence.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

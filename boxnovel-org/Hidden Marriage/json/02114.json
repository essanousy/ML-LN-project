Her expression started to turn solemn. \u201cWhat? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Japanese roses above their heads wilted one by one in the night breeze. Some time passed when\u2026</p><br/><p>The man finally spoke, \u201cXiao Xi, I didn\u2019t arrange it. Dr. Zhao\u2019s words are true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mind went blank for a second as if she could not immediately understand what Lu Tingxiao meant. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did get you and Little Treasure to do a DNA test. The DNA test results are real too\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao took a deep breath. He took a report out and gave it to the girl. \u201cXiao Xi, you <em>are </em> Little Treasure\u2019s biological mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blankly took the report from Lu Tingxiao and she slowly looked at the conclusion right at the bottom of the report. In the next second, her pupils shrank and her mind went blank.</p><br/><p><em>To sum up, the aforementioned examination of the 19 STR genes\u2019 results show that Ning Xi\u2019s tested heredity genes match the genetic criterion to be Lu Qingyu\u2019s biological mother. The probability value of their parent-child relationship is calculated at 99.9999%\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>Based on the DNA analysis, it supports Ning Xi as Lu Qingyu\u2019s biological mother\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mouth was wide open, yet she could not utter a word.</p><br/><p>As if Lu Tingxiao was afraid that he would lose the courage to speak again, he immediately continued, \u201cXiao Xi, Little Treasure is our child. The child of you and I.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, the fact that Ning Xueluo could so easily appear was more or less a result of his allowing it. He wanted to use this as a way to force himself from evading anymore.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt like she was dreaming. In the dream, everything was turned upside down, causing her mind to be all messed up. She could not tell whether this was a dream or reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be?! My\u2026 My child\u2026 Back then, my child\u2026 died\u2026 already died\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s thin lips tensed up. \u201cEven though I\u2019m currently unsure why, but the fact is that he didn\u2019t die. He is Little Treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is Little Treasure\u2026 That child is Little Treasure\u2026 Little Treasure is\u2026 my child?\u201d Ning Xi was in a daze.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao confirmed, \u201cYes, he\u2019s our child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOurs\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao closed his eyes. Then, he said with a slightly trembling voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Xiao Xi\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I already knew about this more than a year ago. But\u2026 I couldn\u2019t tell you\u2026 that the person who hurt you\u2026 the culprit who made you suffer and be in despair for so long\u2026 was me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI was afraid that you\u2019d leave me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That proud man had, at this very moment, said the words \u201cafraid\u201d to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That person was me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he finished, he stood there silently while the radiance surrounding him dimmed as if he was a person waiting for a death sentence. In that instant, all signs of life were removed from him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

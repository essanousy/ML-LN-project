She held her forehead weakly, \u201cDoctor\u2026 where\u2019s the doctor? I think I may have damaged my brain in the fall, I\u2019m having hallucinations\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to her, Lu Jingli had an innocent expression, \u201cI didn\u2019t even fall but I think my brain got damaged too?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment in time, no matter how strong Ning Xi\u2019s heart had become after getting abused a million times over, she could not accept the truth before her.</p><br/><p>She had saved a little bun, and now the little bun\u2019s father wanted to repay her with his body?</p><br/><p>If this were someone else, then it would be fine. If they were somewhat handsome, then she could still treat it as a romantic affair.</p><br/><p>However, this was Lu Tingxiao they were talking about, Lu Tingxiao ahh!!!</p><br/><p>Based on appearance, she did have some looks to speak of, but what kind of person was Lu Tingxiao? Surely he had already seen countless peerless beauties.</p><br/><p>If he had only taken a liking to her, she would not have been so shocked. If Lu Tingxiao had wanted to play with her after seeing her face, she could still understand, but what he had said was \u2018Marry me\u2019, this was practically turning into horror.</p><br/><p>Most importantly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gay?\u201d Ning Xi blurted.</p><br/><p>\u201cBwahahaha\u2026.\u201d Lu Jingli laughed until he fell.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face became as black as the underside of a pot, the whole ward became shrouded in dark clouds instantly.</p><br/><p>After a long while, Lu Jingli finally managed to hold back his laughter, \u201cIf my brother was gay, then where did Little Treasure come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, surrogacy, artificial insemination?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf my brother was gay, then why would he want to repay you with his body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo cover up his real sexual orientation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahaha bro I can\u2019t help you anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also heard\u2026 that the two of you are\u2026\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s gaze subtly shifted between the two brothers.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough\u2026.\u201d Lu Jingli was frightened to the point of choking, \u201cShit, that kind of taste is too heavy for me! Although I\u2019m so handsome that I can go for both the men and the ladies\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the center of the storm slowly stood up from his chair, his slender legs were moving closer to Ning Xi with every step, \u201cJingli, bring Little Treasure out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Brother, what do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao slowly fixed the cuff of his sleeve, \u201cProving my sexual orientation to Miss Ning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the other\u2019s dark expression and the gaze that wanted to completely devour her, Ning Xi was so scared that she fell out of bed. She retreated behind Little Treasure, this close to just jumping underneath the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr Lu, I didn\u2019t start any of this, it was all nonsense I heard from outside! You should chase all this back to the source! Also, you really, really don\u2019t need to thank me, if you absolutely, definitely want me to give you a request, then I request that you please do not ask me for another request\u2026. Ah, sorry, I have a very important audition coming up later, I have to go now! We\u2019ll meet again if we\u2019re fated okay~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spit out her words quickly and prepared to sneak away.</p><br/><p>However, after just a few steps, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s cold voice came from behind her, \u201cDid I permit you to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was so frightened that her legs began to shiver.</p><br/><p>My life comes to an end now!</p><br/><p>After a few seconds, under her death-awaiting gaze, Lu Tingxiao passed her a piece of paper and a pen, \u201cCould I trouble Miss Ning to leave Little Treasure a note, so that he won\u2019t worry about you when he wakes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just\u2026. Just like that?</p><br/><p>She survived a close shave!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes yes no problem! I can even write ten thousand words!\u201d Ning Xi heaved a huge sigh of relief, and picked up the pen to start writing briskly.</p><br/><p>Once done writing, deathly afraid of a sudden turn of events, she quickly sprinted off.</p><br/><p>Watching the girl leave, the man had a deep expression, as if he were watching prey that had already been collared.</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi had left, Lu Jingli immediately sidled up to his brother and bounced, \u201cBrother, am I dreaming? You really fancy Ning Xi? It\u2019s already been 32 years, even perseverance was about to fail soon, and you haven\u2019t taken a liking to any girls. Even I, your dear brother, was starting to suspect if you were bent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the word \u2018bent\u2019 came out, his brother threw out the words: \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lu Jingli choked.</p><br/><p>He really wanted to ask! Having to stifle this stomach full of curiosity was going to kill him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

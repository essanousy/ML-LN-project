What made it even more perfect was that Ning Xi wasn\u2019t around. Thus, she moved close to Jiang Muye with a shy expression, \u201cMuye-ge, where should we go to eat? Would you like to go to Hundred Rivers Hotel for seafood? My father\u2019s a member there, we can use the VIP room there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye stretched lazily with waning enthusiasm, \u201cForget it, I\u2019m not going. I\u2019m too tired today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing was anxious upon hearing so, \u201cAh? But today\u2019s your first day on set, you should have this welcome feast no matter what!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s expression sank when he heard this, \u201cWho made the rule that there has to be a welcome feast on the first day? If you want it so badly, go eat it yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, everyone knew that Jiang Muye\u2019s temper wasn\u2019t too good.</p><br/><p>He would be easy to get along with when he was in a good mood. If he wasn\u2019t in a good mood, then\u2026</p><br/><p>And right now, this guy was obviously in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>Having been scolded, Jia Qingqing\u2019s eyes immediately turned red, \u201cI just thought that this was proper etiquette. Muye-gege, why did you have to say it like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it, who\u2019s your Muye-gege?</p><br/><p>With the frustration in his heart, Jiang Muye was about to explode. To the side, Guo Qisheng saw that the situation didn\u2019t look good, so he tried to smooth over the situation and said, \u201cLet\u2019s postpone it to some other day then. Muye seems to be very tired today. We should have let him rest and get used to the environment on the first day since we didn\u2019t think that we would immediately shoot a few scenes. Everyone, let\u2019s go back early and rest today. We have plenty of chances for a welcome feast later on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then\u2026\u201d After she was able to get out of the sticky situation, Jia Qingqing unwillingly nodded. At the same time, her hatred towards Ning Xi surged. It was all because of Ning Xi hogging Muye-gege for the entire day, that he was tired to the point that he didn\u2019t even want to eat dinner!</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing lowered her head and secretly flipped through the few photos in her phone, and a malevolent smile rose on her lips.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi, just you wait, I\u2019m going to make you pay the price!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the Lu residence.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, I\u2019m back!\u201d Once she got home, Ning Xi\u2019s fatigue was completely washed away.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure trotted over to welcome her upon hearing her voice, even holding a glass of ice cold fruit juice in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, you\u2019re too sweet! Love you!\u201d Ning Xi took it over and gulped it all down in one shot, before happily saying, \u201cCome here, come here, Auntie\u2019s going to take you to change into some cute clothes. We\u2019re going out to eat hotpot in a while!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun who had always run back to his room upon hearing \u2018going out\u2019, obediently allowed Ning Xi to lead him upstairs.</p><br/><p>When they reached the bedroom, he allowed her to try set after set of clothes on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s too plain, this one\u2019s too dark, this one\u2019s too boring\u2026 My goodness! Who bought these clothes for you? What kind of aesthetic sense is this! I don\u2019t even need to ask, it must be your dad! Has he forgotten that you\u2019re only 5 years old, not 35?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi complained as she rummaged through the closet, before finally picking up a piece that she was most satisfied with, \u201cWow! This one\u2019s so cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a white short-sleeved shirt with a hoodie that had two long bunny ears and a pair of overalls to match. The overalls even had a large pocket on the front like Doraemon.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at this style, your second uncle must have bought this for you! He\u2019s pretty dependable on this front. Little kids should wear cute clothes and look a little more lively!\u201d Ning Xi nodded in self-satisfaction before asking, \u201cDarling, what do you think? Do you like this one? If you don\u2019t like it, Auntie will find another one for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t forget to seek Little Treasure\u2019s opinion, though Little Treasure would always agree with her opinion every time.</p><br/><p>As expected, the little bun nodded without hesitation this time.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ning Xi happily helped the little bun put on the outfit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why is your ID this corny? It\u2019s like you\u2019re still in middle school!</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t anticipated that the investor who had joined at the last moment was actually Lu Jingli. This was beyond her expectations, but still within reason. After all, this was Jiang Muye\u2019s first big film after returning to the country. It was only natural that Golden Age would spend a lot of effort to support it.</p><br/><p>However, Golden Age really lived up to its reputation as the industry\u2019s richest company by dropping 50 million on a mere second male lead role.</p><br/><p>All the misunderstandings were resolved with Wang Taihe\u2019s Weibo post. While the stains on Ning Xi\u2019s reputation had been thoroughly wiped clean, Jia Qingqing was now saddled with the reputation of being an arrogant, despicable and trashy actress. Unfortunately, even though more observant people had already realized that Jia Qingqing was the instigator behind Ning Xi\u2019s scandal, there was no conclusive evidence.</p><br/><p>Everything that had happened up to this point were within Ning Xi\u2019s predictions. However, she didn\u2019t expect an even more shocking development would come later.</p><br/><p>Late last night, Jia Qingqing\u2019s manager Han Ying had posted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Han Ying directly exposed how Jia Qingqing had made use of her fans to slander Ning Xi. She even spilled the entire story of how Jia Qingqing had used a second account to disguise herself as one of Jiang Muye\u2019s fans in order to rile them up and use them to attack Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Han Ying also revealed something even more shocking: Jia Qingqing was actually a mistress masquerading as a rich heiress!</p><br/><p>The rich father she was rumored to have wasn\u2019t actually her father. In reality, he was her sugar daddy and he already had a wife and kids.</p><br/><p>Han Ying\u2019s Weibo post contained extremely damning chat records and scandalous revelations. No matter what Jia Qingqing tried to say, she still wouldn\u2019t be able to talk her way out of this.</p><br/><p>Currently, there was only one path left for Jia Qingqing. Quietly going into retirement.</p><br/><p>As for a comeback, in the unpredictable and tumultuous entertainment industry, her chances of coming out of retirement were virtually zero.</p><br/><p>After Han Ying had violated the ethics of her profession by exposing the secrets of an entertainer under her management, her own career as a manager was basically over as well. What sort of conflict did she have with Jia Qingqing that pushed her to cause their mutual destruction? It was a mystery.</p><br/><p>After the matter blew up, Starlight Entertainment tried to delete the post and end the gossip, but unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t resolve the situation. Instead, the netizens became even angrier.</p><br/><p>In order to appease the enraged public, Starlight attempted to do damage control by releasing a statement saying that they would launch a thorough investigation regarding the role Jia Qingqing played in slandering Ning Xi. The company didn\u2019t touch on the matter of Jia Qingqing being a sugar baby, but they basically expressed that they would investigate further. They were clearly unwilling to let go of Jia Qingqing, whom they had spent so much money developing.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t have any scenes to film today, so she had originally planned to spend the day relaxing at home. However, it couldn\u2019t be helped that the situation had blown up so much. Her plans for rest were cancelled. Right after finishing breakfast, she got a phone call and had to go down to the company.</p><br/><p>In the conference room, Ning Xueluo, Chang Li, and Jia Qingqing were all present. The head of public relations, Feng Haoyang, was also in attendance.</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing\u2019s head was lowered and she had large dark circles under her eyes. The moment she saw Ning Xi, she quickly stood up in a frenzy, \u201cNing Xi, you bitch! Are you proud of yourself now? Just you wait, I\u2019m not going to let you off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi helplessly scratched her ear. Every time, it was more or less the same line. She had almost reached the point of becoming deaf.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! Don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve stirred up enough trouble?\u201d Feng Haoyang scolded impatiently.</p><br/><p>As unwilling as she was, Jia Qingqing could only sit back down while feeling wronged. When her spineless sugar daddy had seen that their affair had been exposed, he had immediately cut off all contact. At this moment, her fate was entirely in the hands of Feng Haoyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cSit.\u201d Feng Haoyang said to Ning Xi. His expression was full of hesitation, as if he was trying to make a decision.</p><br/><p>At this time, Chang Li who was sitting nearby spoke up, \u201cNing Xi, you should know of what happened last night so I\u2019m not going to explain it all again. This is how things are going to go down. In a moment, Qingqing will release a statement apologizing for slandering you. You will respond by saying that you were also in the wrong. Act a little more magnanimous and say that you have forgiven her.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

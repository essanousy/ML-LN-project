Ning Xi is at least ten times prettier than Ning Xueluo!]</p><br/><p>[Cut the crap about shady arrangements! Don\u2019t frame innocent people! Muye is the most popular here, It\u2019s only natural to have more of his screen time. The crew isn\u2019t stupid!]</p><br/><p>[This is the second preview. The first preview featured the main protagonists and the second featured the secondary protagonists. What\u2019s wrong with that? It seems to me that some fans are just overreacting!]</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Basically, both Ning Xueluo's and Zhao Sizhou's fans angered Jiang Muye\u2019s die hard supporters, adding fuel to the exchange. Jiang Muye\u2019s fans had exceptional keyboard warrior abilities and they spared no mercy.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was having goosebumps from watching the arguments; she was glad that she was on Jiang Muye\u2019s side this time. She thought to herself, \"I should treat him better next time. After all, there's an impeccable army of iron maidens right behind him!</p><br/><p>They're so loyal and ferocious!\" Some people had just briefly mentioned Jiang Muye\u2019s name while ridiculing her, but his fans were already counterattacking them.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued looking at the news while she made a call to Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>After a long time of ringing, Jiang Muye picked up the call and started blabbering the moment the line got through, \"Don\u2019t tell me about your confession. I don\u2019t want to hear about it. That\u2019s all. Bye bye, the user you\u2019re calling is unavailable\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was exasperated. \"What\u2019s wrong with you? Who\u2019s talking about my confession?!\"</p><br/><p>There was a silence, then Jiang Muye cautiously asked, \"Then, why did you call me?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied while scrolling through the web pages, \"I\u2019m about to praise you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Praise me?\" Jiang Muye sat up as straight as a rod now. \"What\u2019s gotten into you\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, I just got home and was looking through the news!\" Ning Xi replied.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye instantly knew what she was up to and he preened cheerfully, \"How is it? What do you think of the power of my female fans?\"</p><br/><p>\"They're awesome! Exceptional! Actually...I\u2019m quite envious of you! I wonder when will I have such a fan base. I\u2019d be right even when I\u2019m wrong and people will just rain compliments all over me everyday! The definition of happiness!\" Ning Xi gushed, full of admiration.</p><br/><p>\"You still have a long way to go!\" Jiang Muye spoke with a tone of seniority. Then, he suddenly changed the topic. \"Right, so what happened to your confession?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned. \"Didn\u2019t you just say you don\u2019t want to know anything about it? Even women don\u2019t change their minds as quickly as you do!\"</p><br/><p>\"Forget about that! Ning Xiao Xi, are you telling me or not? Have you confessed? What\u2019s going on now?\" Jiang Muye asked quickly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took her own sweet time to reply. \"What's going on now is...dear Jiang Xiao Ye, please don\u2019t be rude and call my name directly. Next time, address me as Aunt!\"</p><br/><p>It was Jiang Muye\u2019s turn to be speechless.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

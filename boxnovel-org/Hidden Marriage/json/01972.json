What matters is what you\u2019re going to do now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao pivoted away happily and broke eye contact with Zheng Anru.</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru\u2019s expression darkened. She stood there and remained silent. It was a mess inside her head.</p><br/><p>She was freaking out for real this time.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Ning Xi, how did you get the role of the female lead in this movie?\u201d The reporters asked Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Before Ning Xi could answer, the assistant director Simon Joseph replied, \u201cSimple, that\u2019s because Ms. Ning Xi\u2019s image fits the image of the female lead, Anna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time Hollywood is using a Chinese actress as the female lead in a movie. As the most popular star in China as of now, we believe she\u2019s the best choice,\u201d Weir added on.</p><br/><p>This was a big slap on Han Zixuan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Weir, have you seen any of Ms. Ning Xi\u2019s work before?\u201d A male reporter asked.</p><br/><p>While they were really a team now, it was still unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, after I found out that I\u2019m going to act with Ms. Ning Xi, I looked through her work. \u2018The World\u2019 has a really strong flavor of China; while I don\u2019t fully understand it, Meng Changge\u2019s character is fantastic, and the blind mother she played in the movie \u2018Mother\u2019\u2026 She really expressed humanity and motherhood to the fullest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for Ms. Ning Xi\u2019s performance in the male outfit in the movie \u2018Dream Chaser\u2019, it further proved that she has the capability to handle the role of Anna in a male outfit!\u201d Weir analyzed carefully, showing that he was really informed about Ning Xi\u2019s past work.</p><br/><p>Actually, Weir had watched Ning Xi\u2019s work and was really fond of her performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a way, I\u2019m a fan of Ms. Ning Xi\u2019s. I\u2019m really looking forward to work with her.\u201d Weir smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Weir,\u201d Ning Xi said to Weir.</p><br/><p>It was out of Ning Xi\u2019s expectation to receive such a high praise from Weir.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that Mr. Weir would be a fan of Ms. Ning Xi\u2019s.\u201d The reporters were shocked after they listened to Weir\u2019s comment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your answer, Mr. Weir. I have another question. If you had a choice, would you rather be in a scene with Ms. Ning Xi or Ms. Han Zixuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Weir was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Ning Xi and Ms. Han Zixuan: who would you prefer to work with\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter thought Weir did not catch his words, so he repeated it again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand what you mean, but\u2026 the Ms. Han Zixuan you mentioned\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve never noticed her before,\u201d Weir said.</p><br/><p>Top international stars like him would never sugar coat their words at public events.</p><br/><p>If they knew, they knew, and they would just admit so if they did not.</p><br/><p>The expressions on Zheng Anru\u2019s and Han Zixuan\u2019s faces were darker than the bottom of a kettle at the moment.</p><br/><p>The assistants were starting to complain.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Weir, Ms. Han Zixuan is also a top star in our country. Well, her popularity is on par with Ms. Ning Xi\u2019s.\u201d The reporter sounded awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve only see the works of Ms. Ning Xi before and don\u2019t know about Ms. Han Zixuan. If any chance arises in the future, I\u2019ll definitely look at them and answer your question by then,\u201d Weir replied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

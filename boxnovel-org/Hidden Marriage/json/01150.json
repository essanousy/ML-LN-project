He quickly took a chair and gestured to Ning Xi. \"Please sit, Sis Xi.\"</p><br/><p>He then got her a glass of water before standing in front of her awkwardly again. He did not know how to initiate a conversation with her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a sip of water from the glass and glanced at the young man. \"Speak your mind!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang chewed on his lip. After some time, he spoke quietly, \"Sis Xi, can I still be saved?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi studied him. He seemed like a nervous young man awaiting his life sentence. \"The world will save the one who wants to save himself. Now that you\u2019re still here and asking me this question, there\u2019s still hope for you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang\u2019s tensed up back relaxed a little and his eyes watered. \"I know about the story of the boy who cried wolf.

Are you really just a normal actress?\" Zhuang Rongguang asked her curiously.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes brightened. \"What if I said no?\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang was a little taken aback, then he said with determination, \"No matter who you were before, good or bad, you\u2019re treating my sister so well and have helped us so much. You\u2019re a good person in my heart! Moreover, giving the enemy kindness is being cruel to yourself! You became my brother when you opened fire!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

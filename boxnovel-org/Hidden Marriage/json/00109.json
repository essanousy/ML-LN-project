Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression clearly turned blank for a moment before he stared at the girl\u2019s back. His tone was slightly higher than usual, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was pretty happy to fulfill this kind of request from this little girl.</p><br/><p>Realising that there were too many ways to interpret her words, Ning Xi hurriedly corrected, \u201cPlease don\u2019t misunderstand! I meant exactly what I said, there\u2019s no other meaning to it! Uh, actually that seems quite lewd as well\u2026 Ahem, basically what I meant was, I bought an outfit for you while shopping today, would you like to try it on? If you try it on now, you don\u2019t have to take off your clothes again to try it on! Aren\u2019t I smart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked slightly startled upon hearing so, and he looked overwhelmed by the unexpected favour, \u201cYou bought something for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had thought that she had bought the outfits for Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! However, ahem, I used your card!\u201d Ning Xi rubbed her nose awkwardly, \u201cActually I was prepared to use my own money at first, since it\u2019s a present for Little Treasure. I forgot that I bought a new engine for my bike last month, so there\u2019s no more money left on my card. I could only use your card. Anyway, when I was passing by another shop, I saw another men\u2019s outfit that looked extremely matching with the one I bought for Little Treasure, so I couldn\u2019t help but buy it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like that.\u201d Although she hadn\u2019t bought it specially for him, it was enough to make him happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked the shop assistant, you can return it if you don\u2019t like it. Quickly try it on and see if you like it!\u201d Ning Xi urged him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao said without hesitation: \u201cI like it.\u201d She had bought it personally and it was the first time she had bought clothes for him. How could he not like it?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen how it looks yet!\u201d Ning Xi mumbled and moved a step backwards, reaching behind her back to pass one of the bags in her hands to him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao received the bag, \u201cYou only bought clothes for Little Treasure and me? Did you not anything for yourself at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed, \u201cAh, I\u2019m broke, so I\u2019m going to wait till I get my salary before I go shopping again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was about to say that she could just use his card, when Ning Xi took out said black card from her bag, \u201cOh right, I\u2019ll return this to you! It felt pretty cool when I used it! I was almost angered to death by a bitch who wanted to snatch clothes from me today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao could only sigh lightly and say, \u201cKeep it first. I\u2019m usually busy and I don\u2019t have the time to shop for Little Treasure. If you see anything appropriate, just buy it. Of course, I\u2019d be delighted if you helped me pick something as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re placing so much trust in my fashion sense? As long as you don\u2019t change your mind after you try on the outfit later!\u201d Ning Xi didn\u2019t bother standing on ceremony with him and just kept the card again, \u201cThen I\u2019ll return it to you when I leave! Change quickly, I\u2019m going out first!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was about to take a step when her empty hand was grabbed by the man from behind.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi jumped in surprise. She subconsciously wanted to turn around, but after remembering that Lu Tingxiao was only wearing a towel, she could only maintain that awkward position of having her hand pulled from behind, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao tightened his hold on her slender wrist, \u201cNing Xi, Little Treasure has been getting better recently. He\u2019s no longer clinging to you and he has become much more obedient than before. He won\u2019t bother you and he won\u2019t disturb your work. He only wants to see you everyday, wait for you to return home. He\u2019s really really happy knowing that you\u2019re sleeping right next door\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that I don\u2019t have any more reasons to keep you, but as a father, I can\u2019t do much for Little Treasure. I really hope that Little Treasure can stay this happy for a while longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree months. Just stay three more months, please? When the time comes for you to go, I absolutely won\u2019t pressure you to stay anymore. Within that period, you can treat this place like your own home. Do as you like, you don\u2019t have to be apprehensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you curse when you\u2019re angry, if you eat durians or garlic, you can also drink at bars until late\u2026 I only have a small request. Within these three months, could you exercise a little restraint? Just don\u2019t bring men back, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the start, Ning Xi had been so touched she had almost cried. However, at the end, she almost puked up three litres of blood.</p><br/><p>Why did it end up sounding like Lu Tingxiao was the gentle, loving and obedient wife, while she was the scummy husband immersing herself in debauchery?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Lu Tingxiao opened the door with great force.</p><br/><p>He saw that Ning Xi was sitting quietly on the sofa while holding the red-colored thick album...</p><br/><p>When he saw that the girl was holding the album, Lu Tingxi\u2019s usual calm demeanor was replaced by a wave of anxiety, and even his voice shook, \"Ning Xi\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked, surprised at the sudden appearance of Lu Tingxiao, who looked anxious and was panting with his tie and outfit a little messed up\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Uh, boss...what...what happened to you?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao went towards her, his gaze fixed on the album she was holding\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly apologized, \"Ah! I\u2019m...I\u2019m sorry...I saw that it was placed here...and I thought it shouldn\u2019t be anything confidential...so I just picked it up and looked through\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She then put the album back quickly.</p><br/><p>\"Ning Xi, my mother had someone put it there. I haven\u2019t actually seen it myself,\" Lu Tingxiao said, failing to hide his anxiety.</p><br/><p>\"Oh\u2026\" Ning Xi scratched her head.</p><br/><p>\"You don\u2019t believe me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha? Of course, I do!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" Lu Tingxiao was not very good at explaining things, so after a pause, he continued, \"Please don\u2019t get angry, it was my parents' decision to do this. I don\u2019t have any intentions to go on a blind date. I won\u2019t go even if they had it arranged for me.\"</p><br/><p>He had gotten all excited because of her text and had completely forgotten about something so important.</p><br/><p>Only when he reached the company lobby did he remember that the blind date album was still in the office. Ning Xi had gone in for quite a while already, so most probably she would have seen it\u2026</p><br/><p>After a while of processing his words, Ning Xi realized what had happened and she was surprised.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao rushed here...for this?</p><br/><p>At that moment, she felt something nudge deep in her heart\u2026</p><br/><p>She did know that to make things possible, she would need to put in a lot of effort, but she was not so selfish as to make Lu Tingxiao wait for her until the end.</p><br/><p>If he met someone he liked even more along the way, she would have given him her blessings!</p><br/><p>The worst case was that if it happened, she would have a wedding to attend...</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked up with a gentle gaze towards the gloomy man, \"Lu Tingxiao, actually you don\u2019t have to be like this. What was that sentence again? It's a big ocean out there, you should go out and explore for yourself. Who knows? You might meet a girl you like even more.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao spoke up before she could finish, \"Ning Xi, there is no one else, you\u2019re my ocean, my whole world.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>The devil did not even need to think now, every thing that came out of his mouth was already flirtatious\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hmm, let\u2019s not talk about this now. Your time is precious. Take a look at this script!\" Ning Xi quickly took the script out.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao glanced at Ning Xi and after confirming that she was not angry, he sighed in relief, \"Wait.\"</p><br/><p>He took off his tie and coat, then hung them on the clothes stand.</p><br/><p>He should really be glad that she was not angry, but he felt a little disappointed\u2026</p><br/><p>She was probably not angry because that she did not care\u2026</p><br/><p>When Lu Tingxiao was not looking, Ning Xi was chanting silently in her heart and she avoided looking at Lu Tingxiao take off his clothes!</p><br/><p>Damn it, seducing me! Seducing me again!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

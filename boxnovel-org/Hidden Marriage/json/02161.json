He went up to Annie and looked at her in the eye. \u201cSis Annie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie\u2019s expression softened when she saw it was Little Treasure. \u201cLittle Treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had always had complicated feelings towards Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>She had hidden herself around Lu Tingxiao for so many years and did not find any chance to penetrate his defenses, but just as she was about to give up, she found out about the existence of this child. She then planned a seven-year-long revenge.</p><br/><p>She had saved this child who was just a cold, near-death baby so many years ago. Now, he was beside Ning Xi and his pure, bright eyes almost blinded her.</p><br/><p>Even now, she did not understand why had she given him the medical pouch back then to delay the poison. She was not sure if the time was not right or if she was just unable to do it\u2026</p><br/><p>This child did not know anything and he still looked up to her as a respectable sister.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure stood before Annie and clenched his fists. \u201cSis Annie, I\u2019ll be fighting you. Thank you in advance for the match!\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie squatted down before the little guy. She looked at him so lovingly and then said, \u201cI concede defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without Little Treasure, there would be no future for her. She would not have met Han Xiao or recovered her memories. Neither would she have found herself and she would forever live in a life of lies.</p><br/><p>She was willing to do anything to make it up to this child.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure looked troubled. \u201cThen, it\u2019s unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie laughed. \u201cNot at all! You beat me with your charm! I admit defeat on my own!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cold rays shot out of Han Xiao\u2019s eyes when he heard Annie. He stared at Little Treasure. \u201cLittle guy, we\u2019ll fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie glared at a certain childish person behind her.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure pursed her lips. \u201cThank you, Sis Annie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao\u2019s jaw dropped as she thought there was no way they would have passed level three. \u201cWhat the heck?! How can this happen?! Lu Tingxiao, you\u2019re cheating! This is cheating!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli laughed. \u201cHahaha! As long as it works! Little Treasure is the real deal! We won it fair and square!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang went along. \u201cWe should be the one saying that. We\u2019ve passed all levels now. Don\u2019t go back on your promise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao leaned against the door frame. \u201cNo way! I want my Little Junior Sister! What happened to our promise of being together forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang dragged Feng Xiaoxiao over. \u201cThat\u2019s enough now. Be careful. Little Junior Sister will kill you if you spoil her fun tonight! I, Second Senior Brother, will buy you some drinks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost! Who\u2019d want to drink with an old man?! No!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang touched his handsome face and felt hurt. \u201cI\u2019ll find you a piece of young, fresh meat alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Feng Xiaoxiao was taken away, everyone else left too.</p><br/><p>If they continued on with the mess, the devil would get mad no matter how happy and patient he was today.</p></div>\n</div>"}

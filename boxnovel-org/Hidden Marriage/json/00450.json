Shi Xiao and Xiong Zhi\u2019s mouth twitched a little as they saw her obediently sitting on the sofa with her magazines\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was not in the mood for leisure right now, so she glanced at Lu Tingxiao and saw that he was very focused on his discussion. She quickly sent someone a text message: [Yun, you bastard!!!!!!!!!!]</p><br/><p>She added a lot of exclamation marks to express her rage.</p><br/><p>A reply came back quickly.</p><br/><p>[Carrot Yun: I dare you to say it again!]</p><br/><p>A threat now, huh? How dare he!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi tapped on her screen: [As you wish! Y u n , y o u b a s t a r d ! ! !]</p><br/><p>[Carrot Yun: Ning Xi! Are you looking for trouble?!]</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was boiling with anger when she saw this message. She replied: [So you\u2019re ashamed of what you\u2019ve done now? You knew that you couldn\u2019t win him in person, so you used a surprise attack! What a low move! It\u2019s a shame to all bastards to even call you a bastard!!!]</p><br/><p>The next reply arrived around 10 seconds later: [A surprise attack?]</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied quickly: [Who else would it have been if it wasn\u2019t you?! Don\u2019t tell me that Firo and Alice weren\u2019t your people!]</p><br/><p>A reply came back almost instantly: [Carrot Yun: You guys had a fight?]</p><br/><p>[You bet! If it hadn\u2019t been for my wits and courage, I would have died! And don\u2019t you try to change the topic, that isn\u2019t the main point!]</p><br/><p>[Carrot Yun: My dear, of course, it\u2019s the main point.]</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, in an underground bar in Las Vegas.</p><br/><p>Under dazzling lights and loud music booming, drunk people were dancing their night away in the dance pool.</p><br/><p>A handsome blonde-haired, blue-eyed man sat under the giant crystal disco ball in the middle of a luxurious booth, with a glimmer of evil emanating from his eyes.</p><br/><p>A large crowd of hot, skimpily-dressed girls surrounded him and drank happily, it was a sumptuous feast indeed...</p><br/><p>A black-haired Asian man sat near him, alone on a big sofa. He wore gold-framed glasses, had a pair of blue earphones on and was working on his laptop in front of him. He gave people the impression that he wanted no one near him.</p><br/><p>No matter how things got crazy in the bar, everyone avoided him. It formed a sharp contrast compared to the blonde Italian man's table.</p><br/><p>A while later, the black-haired man nodded respectfully at the laptop then walked up to the Italian man, and said with a calm tone, \"Mr. Augustine, did Firo act under your orders?\"</p><br/><p>The blue-eyed Italian man with blonde hair looked up drunkenly, \"Mmhmm...Firo...oh yes, those were my orders! What\u2019s wrong, my dear buddy?\"</p><br/><p>The black-haired man said matter-of-factly, \"You\u2019ve gone against someone that you shouldn\u2019t have.\"</p><br/><p>\"Someone that I shouldn\u2019t go against?\" the man asked, still confused. However, it looked like something dawned on him and he had realized something. \"You mean that woman\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

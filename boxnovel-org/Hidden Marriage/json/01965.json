You don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d Ning Xi hugged the white tiger and did not want to let go.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care of my white tiger?\u201d Han Xiao was taken aback, unsure about what Ning Xi was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Han Xiao\u2019s mouth twitched. She wanted his tiger and asked him not to thank her. Was she a robber?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro Han Xiao!\u201d Ning Xi pleaded in a soft tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Han Xiao declined instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather Han Xiao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d There was no place for compromise.</p><br/><p>\u201cA hundred KFC buckets!\u201d Ning Xi grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Han Xiao was not moved at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a whole KFC store\u2026\u201d Ning Xi pulled out her trump card.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way even if you give me ten thousand of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was even able to endure the temptation of KFC, so Ning Xi gave up.</p><br/><p>It was really not easy to tempt a person with a huge appetite!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli did not sleep for the whole night. Unlike Ning Xi who was smitten with the white tiger, he could not sleep well at all.</p><br/><p>He was afraid that he might end up in the tiger\u2019s belly if he fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao stayed for several days. Lu Tingxiao arranged everything and let Han Xiao recover in peace.</p><br/><p>As for Ning Xi, she enjoyed her time with the white tiger so much that she wished Han Xiao would just stay there forever.</p><br/><p>After a week, Han Xiao recovered completely and let himself out with the white tiger.</p><br/><p>Before he left, he made up an excuse that the white tiger needed food, so he took almost every food item and snack from Ning Xi\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi only realized it after Han Xiao left with his white tiger.</p><br/><p>What the heck?! Was there any tiger that ate snacks?!</p><br/><p>What a good-for-nothing foodie!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Several days later, Jace called Ning Xi to meet up at the private club they had met at the last time.</p><br/><p>It was already afternoon when Ning Xi arrived.</p><br/><p>Jace pulled out a seat like a gentleman when Ning Xi came in.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was pleasantly surprised. \u201cThank you, Mr. Jace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ms. Ning Xi. If possible\u2026 well\u2026 could you\u2026 call me Grandfather?\u201d Jace mumbled nervously.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was taken aback.</p><br/><p>This kind and gentle old man, who was also her idol, had asked her to call him Grandfather.</p><br/><p>She could never turn down a request like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather Jace,\u201d called Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d There was an indescribable expression in Jace\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what it is that you want to talk to me about today?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s about the candidates for the male assassin, Carl.\u201d Jace finally got to the main topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe male assassin\u2026\u201d ( )</p><br/><p>Ning Xi remembered that in the movie \u201cAssassin\u201d, there was a male assassin called Carl. As an important secondary character, he was an assassin who disguised himself as a woman. He was on good terms with the female lead and they always went on missions together.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe new Carl has had some changes in his background. He\u2019s a mysterious Oriental assassin, Chinese to be exact, highly capable, and just below the female assassin in terms of skills. I think it\u2019ll be suitable to scout for a character like this in China,\u201d explained Jace.</p><br/><p>The changes in the new \u201cAssassin\u201d was minimal, and Ning Xi fully understood the changes made in this part.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

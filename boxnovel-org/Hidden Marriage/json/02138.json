Did you think I really wouldn\u2019t know? Kid, you\u2019re too ambitious!\u201d Jace\u2019s gaze was exceptionally stern.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026 I\u2026!\u201d Baron was already drenched in sweat as he tried hard to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jace\u2019s terrifying aura was enough to swallow Baron whole. \u201cAs strong as you may be, the position of the head of the Rothschild clan won\u2019t be yours. Go right back now. For the next ten years, you\u2019re not allowed to leave the house at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTen years?!\u201d Baron was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake him away. If anything goes wrong, you people will have to be responsible for the consequences!\u201d Jace glared at the group of people from the clan in the resort and said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>An European elder immediately waved his hand. \u201cBring Third Master back and watch him stringently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, I don\u2019t want to\u2026 I don\u2019t want to! My capabilities are clearly the strongest. Why?!\u201d Baron\u2019s hysterical voice became further and further away until it vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Rothschild family\u2026 is lacking capabilities the most,\u201d Jace sighed softly, his eyes showing a hint of iciness in them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Lu, I\u2019m very sorry. I didn\u2019t teach my son well and have caused so much trouble for you all.\u201d Jace walked up looking apologetic.</p><br/><p>When Han Wuying saw that Baron had lost his power, he immediately withdrew and retreated.</p><br/><p>If he continued to fight with Han Xiao, he would definitely be defeated without a doubt.</p><br/><p>Now, the European King had appeared himself and even Baron had been taken away to be locked up. Han Wuying could not beat Han Xiao; there was no chance of winning at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot fighting anymore?\u201d Han Xiao stared at Han Wuying and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh!\u201d Han Wuying scoffed, and in a flash, his figure left the resort.</p><br/><p>\u201cRunning away because he couldn\u2019t win, how rude!\u201d Han Xiao felt quite unamused, then his gaze fell on the European King.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld fart, you\u2019ve finally showed yourself!\u201d Han Xiao\u2019s usually nonchalant eyes suddenly lit up with a sinister fierceness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Han Xiao.\u201d Jace looked at Han Xiao. \u201cRegarding that incident years ago, I\u2019m very sorry. Even though I\u2019ve admired the ancient Han family for a long time and your talents too, I wanted you to marry my youngest daughter, but I\u2019ve never insisted on it. Back then, it was because your family wanted to force you to marry my daughter that they killed Miss Qin Youge. It has nothing to do with the Rothschild clan. Besides, haven\u2019t you already taken out the murderer who killed Miss Qin Youge back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard this, Han Xiao was stunned. \u201cOld fart, you really know how to talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jace Rothschild was not angry, instead he had very calmly stated, \u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Through Han Xiao and Rothschild\u2019s words, Ning Xi, Tang Lang and the rest finally knew Han Xiao\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>The ancient Han family\u2019s most evil and charming genius caught the admiration of the European King. Initially, he wanted to let Han Xiao marry his youngest daughter, yet in the end, he had indirectly killed a girl named Qin Youge.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt turns out that Grandfather has such a past!\u201d Tang Lang was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGE\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ning Xi came to a sudden realization. That fashion brand \u201cGE\u201d was Han Xiao\u2019s design.</p><br/><p>At the start, Ning Xi did not know the meaning of \u201cGE\u201d.</p><br/><p>Now, she realized that \u201cGE\u201d referred to \u201cGe\u201d. Han Xiao had created it to commemorate that girl\u2026</p><br/><p>Swoosh!</p><br/><p>At this moment, a pitch-black figure suddenly appeared in the resort. He came close at the speed of light and used his or her palm to hack out at Han Xiao without warning.</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful, Grandfather!\u201d Tang Lang could not help but cry out.</p><br/><p>The figure\u2019s speed was incredibly breakneck.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Han Xiao\u2019s expression turned cold. \u201cI hate ambushes the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Han Xiao did not even turn his head as he gripped that little palm that had struck out.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Han Xiao\u2019s figure wavered as he straight up flung the figure far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnie!\u201d Ning Xi cried out in alarm.</p></div>\n</div>"}

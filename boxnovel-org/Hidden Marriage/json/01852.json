Blood rushed to his head and he was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Ever since Ning Xi had fallen into a coma, he had never seen her again after that time at the sanatorium.</p><br/><p>Despite it being a year, the girl in front of him still reminded him of the first time he had seen her in America.</p><br/><p>The feeling of his first love\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye scratched his head in annoyance and pressed his chest. Stop, heart! You useless thing!</p><br/><p>After calming himself down, Jiang Muye clenched his teeth. \"Damn you, Ning Xiao Xi! What are you talking about?! I've been staying cool for way too long and I just wanted to experience what it's like being a mortal, okay?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi tried not to laugh and nodded sagely. \"As expected of your wisdom, Senior Jiang!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was blinded by the girl's smile, so he avoided her eyes and cursed to himself. \"You... When you did wake up?\"</p><br/><p>\"Uhh\u2026\" Ning Xi sounded a little hesitant and then replied, \"Well... It has been some time\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was incensed \"What?! You've woken up for some time already and you didn't tell me about it? Ning Xiao Xi, do you take me as your brother?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled cheekily. \"If I'd told you earlier, you'll never be surprised!\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm not happy with the surprise at all!\"</p><br/><p>His butt had almost broken into half when he had seen her on the screen!</p><br/><p>\"Also, I never thought of you as my brother, but I'm taking you as my nephew!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye's features twisted. \"Stop that nephew nonsense!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye suddenly went silent as he thought about something.</p><br/><p>After a while, he spoke up, \"I saw the live stream just now, and Chen Mian's Weibo\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye looked a little frustrated. \"I don't need a woman to clean up my mess! What did you promise that old fox Chen Mian?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied, \"I just said I'll pay him back with a movie.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye's expression changed. \"Damn! No wonder! That sly fox!\"</p><br/><p>\"I suggested it myself. I have to star in movies after coming out of retirement anyway. Plus, it was great working with him the last time too.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye's expression did not look very good when he listened to Ning Xi's explanation.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled and said, \"Senior Jiang, when I just joined in the industry... I know you never said it and always messed with me, but you've helped me a lot behind my back. What happened this time was mostly because of me too... It's time for me to help you back this time, Senior Jiang!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye blushed and he turned his face away. \"Bastard, why are you suddenly reminiscing about the past? I'm having goosebumps!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye then asked doubtfully, \"You... How did you know those photos were fake? Did Lei Ming tell you?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her eyebrows. \"Do I need Bro Ming to tell me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Then, how did you know?\"</p><br/><p>It was solid proof after all. A lot of fans gave up on him after they saw the photo.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spread her palms open. \"I think... although you don't have much integrity, you wouldn't be this thirsty.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was speechless.</p><br/><p>Who was the one who had poor integrity!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

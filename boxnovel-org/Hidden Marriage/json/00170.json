Where? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2019s here? That can\u2019t be! She actually dared to appear here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOver there, over there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In an instant, all the reporters looked over and started to bring up their cameras, ready to shoot the latest headlines.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s brows drew together. Her first reaction was to protect Little Treasure and not to let them scare him. She wasn\u2019t too bothered about protecting herself.</p><br/><p>However, without waiting for her to cover the little bun, she felt a large palm press her head into a warm embrace. Following that, the little bun\u2019s soft, tiny hand grasped one of her hands tightly, as if reassuring her and telling her not to be afraid.</p><br/><p>As for those reporters, they all stopped ten steps away from them.</p><br/><p>Two tall men in sunglasses and suits had appeared out of nowhere. With fierce expressions, they blocked the reporters\u2019 path like bouncers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, who are you? Get out of the way! Good dogs don\u2019t block the way!\u201d One of the reporters was so focused on grabbing the juicy news that he blurted out words without thinking.</p><br/><p>However, there was a quick-witted person in the crowd who quickly pulled back the speaker and spoke with an extremely frightened expression, as if he had seen something terrifying: \u201cAre you crazy?! Those are bodyguards from the Lu Corporation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu\u2026 Lu\u2026 Surely you don\u2019t mean that Lu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say! How many Lus are there in this capital!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know that? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s carved on their faces!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Can\u2019t you see the symbol on their uniforms?\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting reminded, everyone retreated as one, taking three steps back. Those who had lashed out hurriedly apologised in panic, \u201cHey, brothers, sorry about that, sorry! We were too blind to recognise Mt. Tai! Please don\u2019t hold it against us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heavens! These were the Lu family\u2019s private bodyguards? Then who were the three people behind them?</p><br/><p>The reporters tried to peep behind the bodyguards, but when their eyes slid past the men in suits, all of them retreated back with pale faces.</p><br/><p>The tall man currently embracing a woman in his arms had a face like frost and looked like a god. However, his gaze was far too fierce right now, and his aura was too oppressive. The more experienced reporters were usually good at reading people, and they could tell that it wouldn\u2019t be good to provoke this man. Thus, they calmed down at the same time and realised that there was something fishy about the situation\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Ning Xi? You must have seen wrongly! They\u2019re a family of three! How could that woman be Ning Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Have you gone crazy while thinking too much about snatching up juicy news? Going around thinking that any random stranger looks like Ning Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person can\u2019t be trifled with! Are you trying to kill us all!?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the reporters started to complain against the person who had spotted Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, it was probably my mistake. But she does look a little like Ning Xi, didn\u2019t you guys think so too\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are they alike at all!? That Ning Xi is a cruel and wicked woman! This lady has a noble and refined air, and she\u2019s clearly a good wife and mother. How could they be the same person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! She looks like such a sweet lady and she\u2019s so cute! How could she possibly be Ning Xi, that bewitching bitch!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, the elevator arrived with a ding.</p><br/><p>The reporters were still lamenting on the spot when the family of three had already disappeared into the elevator:</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, did you see that little boy just now? He\u2019s too cute! He looked like he was carved from the same mold as that man just now, they\u2019re definitely father and son!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat relation does that man have to the Lu family? His aura was so scary!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI keep getting the feeling that that man looked a little familiar\u2026 Uh, why do I feel like\u2026 he seems a little like the God of Fortune himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you mention it! They do look similar! That boy\u2026 could he be the legendary little prince?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

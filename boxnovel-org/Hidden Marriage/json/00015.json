Her face looking like she wanted to cry.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao held his head in one hand, \u201cYou\u2019re scared of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the dark of the night, Lu Tingxiao seemed even more devilishly dangerous compared to his cold self in the day.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shook her head vigorously, then nodded carefully, \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a single person who isn\u2019t scared of you in the capital, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s slender fingers played with the cup in his hands as he slowly said, \u201cSo you\u2019re scared of me because others are afraid of me? Then why don\u2019t you marry me since other women want to as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question frightened Ning Xi to the point that she almost slid off her chair.</p><br/><p>She had just thought that she had escaped this trial in the day. Clearly she had really been too naive.</p><br/><p>How was she supposed to answer such a loaded question?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi trembled as she raised her hand, \u201cBefore answering this question, can I ask another one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded, \u201cYou may.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy me? Is it because Little Treasure is reliant on me? I think that it\u2019s only temporary. He\u2019ll be fine once his emotions have stabilised. Even if he is always like that, you don\u2019t have to\u2026\u2026 you don\u2019t have to inconvenience yourself in this manner\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi painstakingly persuaded him as if advising a young girl that had strayed off the right path.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao put down the cup and raised his eyes to look at her, \u201cI thought I made it clear the first time Ms Ning. I don\u2019t mind saying it again if you still don\u2019t understand. I am going to repay you with my body because you saved Little Treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s exactly because of this reason that I can\u2019t accept this okay!? Ning Xi roared in her heart.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt that she wasn\u2019t able to communicate any further with him on this point. She could only make an apologetic expression, \u201cMr Lu, I\u2019m extremely grateful for your good intentions. I\u2019m absolutely against marriage though, so\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised a brow, \u201cSo, you only want to sleep with me? Yet you don\u2019t want to take responsibility by marrying me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly righ-wait! No no no no\u2026\u2026 that wasn\u2019t what I meant!\u201d Ning Xi was about to kneel for him. Could he be any more terrifying with his words?</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t accept premarital sex.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would believe that\u2026\u2026.\u201d Ning Xi could not help mumbling under her breath after hearing that.</p><br/><p>You\u2019ve already gotten someone pregnant before marriage, okay?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression was a little unfocused as looked out the window, \u201cLittle Treasure was an accident, I don\u2019t know who his mother is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Why did this sound so terrible?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re minding that I have a son?\u201d Lu Tingxiao suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d It\u2019s as Lu Tingxiao said, all the women in the capital were wracking their minds to be Little Treasure\u2019s stepmother. How could she mind that he had a son!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Judging by the way things were going, Lu Tingxiao would not be letting her off unless she provided a satisfactory answer.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held her forehead helplessly. She said after taking a deep breath, \u201cMr Lu, marriage is not a game. Regardless of whether it\u2019s for the sake of repaying a debt or other reasons, we just met. Do you understand my personality? Do you know my past?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one I want to marry is the present you. Your past has nothing to do with me.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s answer was overbearing as expected.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s expression cooled down, \u201cHowever, to me, my past is also a part of me. I have no way of cutting off my past to marry you. Mr Lu, we are travelling on different paths. I sincerely suggest that you take back your absurd idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that was a thick silence.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought that the other would start throwing a huge temper due to the humiliation of being rejected again.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao spoke up with an even tone, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s tightly wound nerves finally relaxed, \u201cThen I\u2019m going to sleep, good night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked at that frail back, his gaze was as unfathomable as the ocean depths. The only thing that didn\u2019t change was the heat that came from the seabed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, you\u2019ve already killed Consort Xian, isn\u2019t that enough? Don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re going to bring down the entire kingdom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Changge\u2019s long, red sleeves tossed and tumbled in the wind like a burning flame. She looked down on the person before her as if she was looking disdainfully on an ant, \u201cThis kingdom was won by the efforts of my Meng family. So what if I destroy it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yingrong was enraged, \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re too unreasonable! You were once a general who protected the soil of this country. Why have you become so petty? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re willing to see this land enveloped in the flames of war and the people still suffering a hundred years later?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Changge\u2019s hair flew wildly in the wind. She cast her gaze downwards and stroked her perfect, long nails. In a crazed tone, she said, \u201cWho cares if the world drowns after I die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect!\u201d Guo Qisheng was so moved that he didn\u2019t know how else to describe it.</p><br/><p>Ye Linglong had specially come to the set today. After watching the scene, she let out a long sigh. She showed a relieved expression, \u201cIn this movie, the role I was the most worried about wasn\u2019t Shangguan Yingrong, but Meng Changge. When I first created Meng Changge, I didn\u2019t cast her as the villain on purpose. I\u2019m leaving it to the audience to decide whether she\u2019s a hero or a villain. As for how the audience can decide this, it\u2019s all dependent on how the actress interprets the role. If the actress doesn\u2019t have enough skill to play the role properly, then Meng Changge will be seen as the biggest villain of the movie. However, if the actress can pull it off, then Meng Changge\u2019s depths would be shown perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clear that Ning Xi was the latter.</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng\u2019s expression was full of excitement. He said confidently, \u201cI have a feeling that Ning Xi will get an award for her role!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Taihe nodded a few times, \u201cShe\u2019s a good sprout. Although Starlight has lost Jia Qingqing, they still have a rising star, Ning Xi. They\u2019ve practically profited from this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCut! Good work! Take a break before we start the next scene!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they had cleared this scene in one take, Guo Qisheng\u2019s earlier gloominess from Jiang Muye\u2019s sudden leave was instantly lifted.</p><br/><p>When they returned to the break room, Ning Xueluo called over her assistant the moment she sat down and inquired, \u201cWhat was the director saying to the rest just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little assistant looked as if she wanted to speak, but didn\u2019t know where to start.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey praised Ning Xi?\u201d Ning Xueluo sneered.</p><br/><p>The little assistant nodded, \u201cDirector Guo said that Ning Xi acted perfectly. Screenwriter Ye said that Ning Xi\u2019s acting was so good that she turned Meng Changge into the protagonist. Producer Wang also praised Ning Xi and said that she would probably go further than Jia Qingiqing. Director Guo even said\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that Ning Xi might get an award for her role\u2026\u201d The little assistant said weakly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo slammed her hand on the armrest, \u201cWhat a boast! Nowadays, awards are based on background, does he think that awards are given out without any support from behind the scenes? So what if she gets an award? At most, she can only get Best Supporting Actress. Isn\u2019t she just there to be my foil!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little assistant quickly agreed, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly as Xueluo-jie says! She\u2019s just acting as a temptress, how can she compare with you? The audience isn\u2019t blind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression warmed a little, but the dark clouds in her eyes didn\u2019t completely dissipate. She lowered her voice and said, \u201cThat thing we prepared before\u2026 it\u2019s time for action!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little assistant cried out in surprise before hurriedly covering her mouth, \u201cWe\u2019re really doing that? But, it\u2019s too dangerous! What if you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop dawdling. If I order you to do it, then go!\u201d Ning Xueluo\u2019s face was full of impatience.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, I\u2019ll go tell that person now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Su Yan\u2019s concerned voice sounded from behind, \u201cXueluo, what happened? Your complexion don\u2019t seem to look too well?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

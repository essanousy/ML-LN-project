Don't chase him anymore! This is too dangerous! Xiao Xi!\"</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Ning Xi could not hear her at this point.</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin was worried that they would get hurt if this continued. Anxiously, she rushed over to stop them from fighting any longer.</p><br/><p>The two of them did not expect Ning Tianxin to suddenly come over. They could not avoid her in time and accidentally bumped into her. Ning Tianxin's entire body fell backward.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt her soul leave her body and Mo Lingtian was so frightened he almost peed his pants too. Thankfully, they managed to steady Ning Tianxin together.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at Ning Tianxin's belly in alarm. \"Bloody hell! You almost hurt my baby!\"</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian was so done. \"Isn't it mine?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi instantly shot a sinister look at him. Hmm? What did you say?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nothing, nothing... Right, it's your baby...yours... You're always right...\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scoffed, then she carefully brought Ning Tianxin into the living room.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sat cross-legged on the sofa, while Mo Lingtian shrunk to a corner on the sofa opposite.</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin brought two cups of scented tea for the both of them. She was relieved to see that Ning Xi had calmed down.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian pinched his temples and looked at Ning Tianxin. \"She...is really your cousin? Biological?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin nodded. \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"What the hell? Why didn't you tell me earlier?!\" Mo Lingtian was having a meltdown.</p><br/><p>Bam! With a loud crash, Ning Xi had slammed the coffee table hard opposite him. \"Watch the way you speak to her!\"</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian gulped. \"No, what I'm saying is...if she had told me earlier, I would've mentally prepared myself. Now that I didn't, I got a shock.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin did not say anything about this. She had actually mention Ning Xi before and had even said her name. However, he would neither remember nor take it to heart.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised up the kitchen knife. \"Bloody hell! How dare you still question my cousin? Who gave you the guts?! Was she the one who got drunk and forcefully tried to sleep with you? Did she want to get pregnant? If she had not stopped me, I would've chopped you up in the hospital!\"</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian knew he was wrong, so he quickly avoided the blade and said, \"It's my fault. I didn't act properly earlier. I was just too anxious to clarify things.\"</p><br/><p>\"Aren't you sure of what you've done yourself?\"</p><br/><p>\"Now, I am...\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put the kitchen knife down with a slam on the table. \"Tell me, how are you going to resolve this?\"</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the living room instantly turned to a chill.</p><br/><p>At last, Ning Tianxin spoke first, \"Xiao Xi, I want to speak to him alone.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was worried about Ning Tianxin being alone, but Ning Tianxin was determined, so she could only shoot Mo Lingtian a murderous warning gaze. She unwillingly got up. \"Call me if there's anything.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin looked gratefully at her. \"Mmm.\"</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi left, the living room returned to silence.</p><br/><p>Moments later, Mo Lingtian asked with difficulty, \"Why didn't you tell me?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Some time passed, and Mo Lingtian finally took a deep breath. He looked to Ning Tianxin and said in a single breath, \"Tianxin, about this, it's my fault. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry! I know that it's useless to say it a million times! I know that as a man, I should be responsible. I know that the words I'm about to say are shameless, but I'm very sorry. I can't have this child...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

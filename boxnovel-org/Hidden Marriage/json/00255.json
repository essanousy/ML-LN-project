After finishing their conversation, she turned to face Ning Xi and exhorted, \u201cNing Xi, Brother Ming and I have something to discuss, go and rehearse your scenes properly with your Senior brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright Sister Zhizhi, you go ahead too~\u201d</p><br/><p>After politely waving her hands to send Lin Zhizhi off, Ning Xi immediately restored her little devil state, and spookily looked at Jiang Muye. \u201cTsk tsk tsk, Golden Hair, did you see it just now? I even felt sorry and agrieved for Sister Zhizhi after knowing she was your ex-girlfriend. I was worried that the both of you will feel awkward after meeting, but in the end, Sister Zhizhi didn\u2019t even glance at you! She was so cool! I am really beginning to like Sister Zhizhi more and more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye gritted his teeth and stared at her fiercely, \u201cWho in the world told you that she was my ex-girlfriend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked innocently, \u201cWasn\u2019t it you who said it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram! I did not even mention a word about it, it was all your groundless assumptions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told your actions to be so easily misunderstood ah\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi grumbled, and immediately after, she became more curious, \u201cSince she isn\u2019t your ex-girlfriend, then what on earth is your relationship with her? Why are you so afraid of her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when was I afraid of her? Ning Xiao Xi, can you stop your divergent thinking!\u201d Jiang Muye was almost tormented to death by her.</p><br/><p>In order to fish for more information, Ning Xi made her voice gentler to appease him, \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll stop having foolish ideas. Say it yourself then! What\u2019s the matter with the two of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other matter is there? She only used to be my agent!\u201d Jiang Muye flipped his script roughly, feeling annoyed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi, feeling surprised, stared with wide eyes, \u201cNo way, Sister Zhizhi was your agent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye rolled his eyes at her, \u201cWhat, why not?\u201d What\u2019s with her expression?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shooked her head, and sighed, \u201cIt is simply more pitiful than being your ex-girlfriend\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire industry knows how wild Jiang Muye\u2019s personality was, none of his assistants lasted for more than a week.</p><br/><p>The only reason why Lei Ming was still his agent for so long without changing was because, even though Lei Ming had a very muscular body, and looked fierce, but in actual fact, his personality was extremely good. He was extremely patient, thus he was able to be by Jiang Muye\u2019s side for that long.</p><br/><p>After knowing that Lin Zhizhi and Jiang Muye did not have that kind of relationship, Ning Xi heaved a sigh of relief. If not, the relationship between the three of them might become awkward easily if one little thing went wrong.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xiao Tao directed people to move a deck chair that looked super luxurious near Ning Xi, then said, \u201cSister Ning, here\u2019s a seat for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the filming group, only the female lead and male lead or those with a higher status get to enjoy this kind of deck chair. Previously, Ning Xi had always been sitting on a small stool at the corner, and at most it will just be a chair. She never thought that there will be a day where she will receive such good treatment\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the hardwork, Xiao Tao!\u201d Ning Xi said in a grateful tone.</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Tao had always felt regretful that Leng Manyun left the industry, and was not satisfied with her current role, but when it was work time, she was still quite diligent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWanna rehearse?\u201d Ning Xi raised her script and asked, resolutely implementing her dearest agent\u2019s order.</p><br/><p>\u201cRehearse, your butt! I played games the entire night yesterday and did not sleep! I\u2019m going to make up for my sleep! Don\u2019t bother me!\u201d After speaking, Jiang Muye used his script to cover his face and he snored away.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi quietly lit a candle for Lei Ming in her heart. After that, she rejoiced for Lin Zhizhi, for she was able to put an end to her misery, fortunately!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

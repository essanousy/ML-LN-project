He had taken up a gun again because of Ning Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer looked at the both of them unhappily as she mumbled, \"I don't want Xiao Xi to lose. Rongguang will be really cheeky if he won\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan smiled. \"That brat is unlucky today, but it's good for him to learn a lesson. Then, he'll know what real talent is!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer was surprised and confused. What did her father mean?</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang and Ning Xi picked their guns, not bothering to put on the protective gear.</p><br/><p>While Zhuang Rongguang felt that those equipment were not cool, Ning Xi was used to real fights whereby the equipment might be an obstacle to her instead.</p><br/><p>\"So, how do you want to do this!?\" Zhuang Rongguang felt confident this time after being humiliated by Ning Xi so many times.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi leaned against the wall. \"You decide the rules, I'll follow.\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang thought about it. \"Okay, ten shots for the both of us. We'll see who gets the highest score!\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's set then, I'll go first!\" Zhuang Rongguang was looking forward to seeing Ning Xi's dumbfounded face. Maybe she would even give up after he was done!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stepped back and signaled that he could start anytime.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang took a deep breath, focused and picked up the gun, then aimed at the target. At that moment, he felt like he was one with the gun.</p><br/><p>He had always favored guns since he was a little kid. He just hated being controlled by his father and he was lazy, so he had denied his father's and grandfather's expectations\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shots were fired one after one. After ten shots were done, the score counter displayed the total score: 100 points!</p><br/><p>Ten consecutive perfect shots! 100 points in total!</p><br/><p>His perfect score shocked the audience!</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang put down the gun and turned to Ning Xi, saying coldly, \"No matter how much you hate me, I hope you stick to our promise and stay away from my sister!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi almost laughed out loud seeing this young man trying to act tough. \"Amazing! I'm really impressed! But I'm not the kind to go down without a fight. I'll try for Keer!\"</p><br/><p>\"Whatever!\" Zhuang Rongguang replied.</p><br/><p>I've got a perfect score. This bastard will lose for sure!</p><br/><p>Actually, he himself was also surprised by his score today. It seemed like he was really a genius, the kind that could release an enormous amount of potential at important moments. What a talented genius!</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang gave his father a glance, trying to silently brag about his achievement.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ning Xi did not start right away. She went up to Zhuang Keer. \"Keer, may I borrow something from you?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

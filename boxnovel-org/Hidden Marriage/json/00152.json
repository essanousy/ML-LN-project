He would follow her wherever she walked, not willing to let even an inch of distance separate them.</p><br/><p>In the living room downstairs.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had also switched on his shadow mode; he was following wherever Lu Tingxiao walked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, Brother, dear Bro\u2026 You guys\u2026 What did the two of you do the whole night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao hugged a cup of freshly brewed coffee and sat on the sofa: \u201cWe chatted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli choked and looked like a disappointed puppy who hadn\u2019t gotten a bone, \u201cAlright, just take it as if I never asked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is the task I entrusted to you progressing?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli immediately switched back to his proper mode and spoke grimly, \u201cIt\u2019s already in progress. Within a month, Zhu Xiangcheng\u2019s Crown Real Estate will definitely be erased from this capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Ning Xi\u2019s matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli tidied his hair before speaking up: \u201cBecause the production crew stopped the news from spreading, I wasn\u2019t able to get the news in time. As for now, the one who set this whole ploy up definitely wouldn\u2019t let the news be stifled, so it\u2019s starting to spread on the Internet. What\u2019s worse is that the prop director personally testified in his interview that it was Ning Xi who had bribed him to change the prop. This isn\u2019t just a matter of public opinion now. If Ning Xueluo files a case, Ning Xi might even be taken by the police for investigation!\u201d</p><br/><p>An endless vicious aura rose on Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face. It suddenly seemed like he was sitting on a great demon king\u2019s throne made of bones instead of a plain ordinary sofa. Enunciating each word clearly in an icy tone, \u201cI\u2019d like to see who would dare to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no no\u2026 Sister-in-law has you to support her, who would even dare to touch a single hair on her head!\u201d Lu Jingli hurriedly tried to calm his rage before stating positively, \u201cBro, just rest assured. I\u2019ve already gotten someone to install wiretaps and spy cameras in that prop director\u2019s home. He\u2019ll definitely try to contact the person behind this in this period of time. There\u2019s no need to worry that we won\u2019t be able to get any evidence. We\u2019ll see who gets arrested in the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dissatisfaction showed on Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression and he tapped the side table with his finger: \u201cInefficient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli couldn\u2019t accept that and grumbled: \u201cThis method is so good, how is it inefficient!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao brought out a gun from under the television stand, then threw it in front of him.</p><br/><p>The corner of Lu Jingli\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cDamn! Isn\u2019t this too simple and violent! There\u2019s no skill in this method!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two were speaking, footsteps sounded from above them.</p><br/><p>Without a change in expression, Lu Tingxiao placed the gun back and looked up with a gentle gaze at the newcomer, \u201cDid Little Treasure fall asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I finally got him to sleep!\u201d After replying, Ning Xi hurriedly said with an anxious expression, \u201cUh, Lu Tingxiao, I have some urgent business and I need to go out for a while. I\u2019ve already left a note for Little Treasure and I charged my phone. You can contact me at any time. I\u2019ll come back in three hours at the max! Alright, I won\u2019t say anymore, bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, she flew like the breeze and left.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli rubbed his chin, \u201cBro, where\u2019s Sister-in-law going in such a rush?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stared in the direction the girl had left with an inscrutable gaze before urging Lu Jingli, \u201cFind someone to follow her.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was definitely something complicated behind this, since Ning Xi had left at this kind of time. If it wasn\u2019t good for Little Treasure to be left alone at home, he would definitely have gone himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to find someone else, I\u2019ll go myself!\u201d Lu Jingli cheerfully accepted the mission on the spot.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli returned home to pick out a more low-key black car, then followed closely behind Ning Xi, who was driving on the roads like a hurricane on her motorbike.</p><br/><p>After twenty minutes, he stopped at the small apartment that Ning Xi used to live in. While monitoring the movements in the area, he reported the situation to Lu Tingxiao in real-time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

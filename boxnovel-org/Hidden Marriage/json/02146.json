She wanted to discuss something with him as well.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao rushed over soon although his phone was ringing non-stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro Tao, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ning Xi handed him a bottle of water as he was drenched in sweat.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao drank half a bottle in one go. Once he could finally talk, the first thing he did was\u2026 to start crying\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was shocked but she quickly comforted him, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Bro Tao? Just what happened? Tell me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao had been dealing with all sorts of matters well, but she had never seen him like this before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it!? My queen! Tell me which bastard it is!\u201d Xu Tao was incensed..</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was confused. \u201cWhat bastard? Who are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao stared at Ning Xi\u2019s womb with his red eyes, \u201cThe baby in your womb\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was hit by a wave of sadness, then he started crying before the steering wheel again. \u201cI\u2019m so frustrated! My queen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned. \u201cHow did you know I was pregnant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s true\u2026 It really is true\u2026\u201d Xu Tao\u2019s heart was breaking apart. He handed his phone over to Ning Xi. \u201cLiang Feixing sent me a message after you called me. Someone leaked the news of your pregnancy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ning Xi quickly took a look at Xu Tao\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>The Weibo status was just posted an hour ago, yet it was now on the top of the hot topic section. All the popular searches included phrases similar to \u201cNing Xi is pregnant\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich hospital did you go for the check up?\u201d Xu Tao asled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one that people usually go to.\u201d Little Treasure had gone there when he was sick. In addition to the fact that Ning Xi tended to overthink a lot recently, she thought that her body was facing grave stress issues, so she did not tell anyone about it and did not go to military hospital either. She just went to a hospital that was known for maintaing people\u2019s privacy.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao then said, \u201cThat hospital was good at keeping secrets, but your pregnancy was too big of a news. Someone probably couldn\u2019t fight the urge and leaked it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Yao clenched his teeth. \u201cWe\u2019ll insist that you\u2019re not pregnant, and claim that those results are forged!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed seeing Xu Tao so mad. \u201cBro Tao, this time, I want to go public.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say!?\u201d Xu Tao nearly wept again.</p><br/><p>Which bastard had made his queen fall in love so much that she would sacrifice her career for him!?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bro Tao. I didn\u2019t give you any time to prepare because I only received the results today myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point! The point is who\u2019s that bastard? Please think properly about it, my queen. This is not a small case. It\u2019ll affect you greatly if you let this go public! While the entertainment industry would be pretty lenient to you being pregnant before marriage, the fans wouldn\u2019t think so!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone knocked on the window when Xu Tao was talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it!?\u201d Xu Tao was alert.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Liang Feixing\u2019s voice came from outside.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao then unlocked the doors.</p></div>\n</div>"}

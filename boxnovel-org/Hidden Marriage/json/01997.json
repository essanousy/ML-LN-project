Xu Tao had found her and cultivated her to become a big star in Glory World.</p><br/><p>The assistant had heard about Yin Youyou\u2019s past before and she knew Yin Youyou must be really upset. She went up to the two of them. \u201cI\u2019ve already said this is Yin Youyou\u2019s exclusive dressing room. Do you dogs not know how to listen to the human language?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, some staff of the TV Station came over when they heard the fuss.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>A bearded middle-aged man and a young woman entered.</p><br/><p>The sharp-chinned assistant quickly complained, \u201cDirector Chen, well, you know this is Youyou\u2019s exclusive dressing room. Every time Youyou comes, she always uses this. The other rooms are too small! But these two people insisted on staying here unreasonably and want to take Youyou\u2019s dressing room!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The director looked at Yin Youyou who was doing her makeup, then glanced at Qin Shuang and Xu Tao.</p><br/><p>The industry would usually pick on the weaker ones, and Yin Youyou was infamous for being a bully.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, there was Qin Shuang. While she became popular overnight, she was not at a level that could be compared to Yin Youyou.</p><br/><p>It was really unnecessary to offend Yin Youyou because of Qin Shuang.</p><br/><p>After a short moment of consideration, the director already had his answer. He turned to Xu Tao and Qin Shuang. \u201cThis dressing room is Ms. Yin\u2019s exclusive dressing room. Why don\u2019t the two of you follow me somewhere else?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant looked really cheeky when she heard that the director was on her side. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Shuang did not want to give Xu Tao any trouble, so she whispered to him, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Bro Tao. Let\u2019s go somewhere else!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao did not say anything, his expression seemed eerie instead.</p><br/><p>The assistant became impatient when the two of them did not move. \u201cYouyou\u2019s program is starting soon. Are you going to be responsible if it\u2019s delayed?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not really a big deal, but this assistant just wanted to make them look bad.</p><br/><p>Director Chen glanced at the time. Because he was rushing, he used a harsher tone. \u201cPlease leave and don\u2019t bother the other artistes who\u2019re going on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant gave a signal to the two bodyguards, then she taunted with her shrill voice, \u201cGet lost! Just how shameless are you to take our dressing room, bringing a small-time extra with you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, the two bodyguards were on their way to chase them out.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was a voice behind Xu Tao and Qin Shuang. \u201cSo\u2026 I\u2019m a small-time extra?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Succumb, succumb! Bro Xi, I\u2019m yours! My being, my heart, my soul, all of me is yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have come here</p><br/><p>Hardly knowing the reason why</p><br/><p>In my mind, I\u2019ve already imagined</p><br/><p>Our bodies entwining</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve decided,</p><br/><p>Decided</p><br/><p>Past the point</p><br/><p>Of no return\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Between the angel and the devil, she lost herself and had wavered.</p><br/><p>She knew that the Phantom was dangerous as he belonged to the darkness, yet she still could not help but get closer to him.</p><br/><p>On the Don Juan stage, they moved closer to each other and finally hugged tightly. This song was foreshadowing these two people who should not love each other but did so in the end as they were unable to avoid falling into the fire pits of love.</p><br/><p>At last, when the Phantom sang that song that Raoul had pledged his love to her with, \u201cAll I Ask of You\u201d, his singing awakened Christine and she recognized him.</p><br/><p>When the female lead took the Phantom\u2019s mask off then and there and saw through his identity, everyone did not let out a sigh of relief. The scene gripped their hearts instead.</p><br/><p>On stage, the Phantom avoided the female lead\u2019s eyes with a sorry look. The other half of his face revealed a cruel mark of ugliness. Just like that, it was completely exposed right before the woman he loved the most.</p><br/><p>All of the audience and fans felt extreme anguish in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Because almost everyone\u2019s attention was on stage at this point, no one noticed Ning Xi\u2019s votes in both categories were already catching up with Han Zixuan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Even though everyone\u2019s votes had been squeezed dry earlier on, there was still a huge group of people who liked to vote at the very last moment, plus under the strong stimulations of wanting to reach to the top, everyone had personally pulled votes from their parents, friends, colleagues, and even strangers. The force of the masses could never be underestimated as long as you had the capabilities.</p><br/><p>Finally\u2026</p><br/><p>The Phantom had completely lost all rationale and he whisked Christine away to his underground lair.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2026 Why was the world so unfair to me? Just because I have a scary face, even my mother was not willing to look me in the face\u2026\u201d The Phantom trembled in extreme distress.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

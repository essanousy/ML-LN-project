She could only find a corner to temporarily sit down and wait for him to leave.</p><br/><p>Based on her understanding of him, he probably would not stay for long.</p><br/><p>However, this time, that guy must have wanted to go against her or something because he did not seem to have any intention of leaving.</p><br/><p>\"CEO Yun, you're truly young and promising, already succeeding at such a young age. It's truly admirable! I wonder what business were you previously doing abroad?\"</p><br/><p>To the point that he could accumulate such terrifying amounts of wealth...</p><br/><p>Many others were very curious about this too. All of them were suspecting that he might be a member of some long-established, big-time clan abroad.</p><br/><p>The white-haired man's long fingers gently grazed his glass of blood-red wine and he said unhurriedly, \"Weapons.\"</p><br/><p>There was dead silence after that.</p><br/><p>Then, came a wave of dry laughter. \"Hahahaha...CEO Yun, you've got a pretty good sense of humor!\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly! CEO Yun, you're too funny!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"CEO Yun, do you already have a girlfriend?\"</p><br/><p>Clearly, this question was in the heads of all the CEOs with daughters.</p><br/><p>The white-haired man seemed to look off into the distance indistinctly, then he said, \"I did, but I've been dumped.\"</p><br/><p>The rest coughed in shock. \"CEO Yun, you're joking again! How could any woman dump you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly! That woman must be blind!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Not too far away, the \"blind\" Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>\"You're truly generous for having returned to the country to invest and support the nation's infrastructural developments. I wonder which industry are you particularly interested in?\" Someone asked.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen replied, \"It depends on my mood.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell! Couldn't they just have a happy conversation!?</p><br/><p>Even if they were annoyed, they had to continue the conversation.</p><br/><p>Fine, you have money, you have the logic, you make all the decisions...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Ning Xi watched how every question posed to Yun Shen received a cold response, yet the crowd was still determined to continue the awkward conversation. Ning Xi admired their psychological perseverance.</p><br/><p>She kept waiting, yet Yun Shen would not leave, and trouble came instead...</p><br/><p>She was sitting in a corner and maintaining a low profile when a strong whiff of alcohol closed in on her. A drunk-looking man in his forties had staggered before her with a beer in his hand, muttering, \"You're...you're Ning Xi?\"</p><br/><p>\"Any comments, sir?\" Ning Xi frowned.</p><br/><p>\"How...how much?\" The man asked.</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Ning Xi squinted.</p><br/><p>\"I'm asking you! How much for a night?!\" That beer mouth released the stench of alcohol as he asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>The man was quite loud and he gradually garnered the attention of those who were with Yun Shen.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me, sir, you're drunk.\" Ning Xi did not want to attract any attention, so she tried her best to be patient and chase him off.</p><br/><p>\"Cut the crap. I'm asking you how much! Hehe, they all say you're really arrogant. I would like to see how hard it can be to sleep with you...\" The beer-bellied man started to say worse things.</p><br/><p>One of the hotel managers noticed the commotion and he quickly walked over to smooth things over, but that person had probably drunk too much and was foul-mouthed while ignoring them. All those who attended the event were important guests. Thus, the manager dared not to offend anyone. The atmosphere instantly fell into a deadlock...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

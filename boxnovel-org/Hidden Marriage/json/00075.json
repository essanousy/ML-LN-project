Why did she have to feel guilty?</p><br/><p>She had been about to ignore all this business, but her phone beeped as Lu Jingli sent over another short video.</p><br/><p>In the video, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s frosty dagger-like gaze shot over directly, giving Ning Xi a huge shock. After staring blankly for a while, she finally realised that he was looking at Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Jingli, I\u2019m giving you half an hour. Redo this proposal for me, now, right here. If you can\u2019t do it, then go to the finance department and collect the rest of your salary!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, the screen went dark.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the second before the video had ended, it was as if she had seen Lu Jingli\u2019s final heartrending cry for help\u2026</p><br/><p>Even an outsider like her knew that it was impossible to redo a new proposal in just half an hour.</p><br/><p>However!</p><br/><p>She really, really had no idea how to save him!</p><br/><p>The gears in Ning Xi\u2019s mind turned, and she flipped through Sun Tzu\u2019s Thirty-Six Stratagems in her mind\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait at leisure while the enemy labours? Lu Jingli\u2019s ghost would kill her!</p><br/><p>Defeat the enemy by capturing their chief? Lu Tingxiao was the king himself!</p><br/><p>Attack something the enemy holds dear to save your allies? Where was she going to find something like that?</p><br/><p>Unless\u2026. The beauty trap? Cough cough\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, Ning Xi smacked herself on the head, \u201cI\u2019ve got it! Luring the tiger out of its lair!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a deep breath, calmed herself down, then called Lu Tingxiao\u2026</p><br/><p>At the present time, in the Lu Corporation.</p><br/><p>In the meeting room, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s phone was connected to the large screen and displaying some of the company\u2019s internal information.</p><br/><p>The higher ups of the company were focusing 12000% of their attention on the screen, because Lu Tingxiao was going to ask them questions later.</p><br/><p>It was just as scary as the times when teachers had asked them questions in class when they were little\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>Without even looking, Lu Tingxiao casually picked up his phone. Thus, in the next second, a girl\u2019s soft and sweet voice was transmitted through the speakers in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Lu Tingxiao, are you busy now?\u201d</p><br/><p>EH?!!!</p><br/><p>In an instant, all the higher ups were dazed, and they all had stupefied expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>This was boss\u2019s private number, right?</p><br/><p>A woman actually called him, in such a sweet tone, and even called him by name directly\u2026</p><br/><p>However, something that would shock them even more was lying in wait\u2026</p><br/><p>When Lu Tingxiao heard that voice, the aura around his body changed subtly.</p><br/><p>As if a life-saving heavenly breeze had just blown into the human world\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli, who had been bent over trying to complete the impossible proposal, heard Ning Xi\u2019s familiar voice. In an instant, he was moved to tears.</p><br/><p>Sister-in-law, you finally came\u2026 sob sob sob\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s reply was only delayed for a second. Following that, he plucked off the cable connecting his phone to the display and placed the phone by his ear. Not a single change could be seen in his expression, and his tone was equally cold and hard, \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing such a scary voice from the other side of the phone, Ning Xi wanted to retreat, but continued persevering in the end. She mustered up her softest, sweetest tone to mumble her request, \u201cUm, are you coming back tonight? We promised Little Treasure that we\u2019d go and eat hotpot today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao remained cold, \u201cI\u2019m busy, I might not come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>TL Note: The Thirty-Six Stratagems come from Sun Tzu\u2019s Art of War. I borrowed some of the translations from the Wikipedia article on it. Try reading it, it\u2019s interesting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

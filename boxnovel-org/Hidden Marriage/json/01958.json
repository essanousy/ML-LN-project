In Hollywood, artistes like Ning Xi could merely get a supporting role.</p><br/><p>It was the first time in history for a Chinese artiste to take on the role of a female lead in Hollywood.</p><br/><p>The film crew was the world\u2019s best too. Even some of the artistes who played insignificant roles were also quite famous in Hollywood.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, the producer this time was the mysterious Jace\u2026</p><br/><p>Based on just the situation in China, many of the big shots\u2019 managers used all sorts of methods to get a small role for their artistes. Even just being cannon fodder would be worth it\u2026</p><br/><p>Sadly, almost none of them succeeded.</p><br/><p>Even if Lu Jingli was extremely confident in Ning Xi\u2019s capabilities, there did not seem to be any logic in the matter.</p><br/><p>Thus, to guard against the unexpected, he was not assured and still asked a few more questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis-in-law, forget about how \u2018Assassin\u2019 is a remake of a mega-classic. Even if it was a normal Hollywood movie, have you seen any Chinese female star play the lead role? Even if it was just an important supporting role, there are very few. In fact, there\u2019s almost none\u2026 Hmm, how old is Jace now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli suddenly thought of something and tried to change the topic without sounding stiff.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi obviously knew what Lu Jingli was thinking about. She straightforwardly said, \u201cAt least 80 years old! Stop thinking about nonsense! Mr. Jace is a very nice person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, could the old mister have lost his mind?\u201d Lu Jingli muttered softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?!\u201d Ning Xi instantly squinted her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 I must say, this time the producers of \u2018Assassin\u2019 are indeed quite skilled. They aren\u2019t restricting themselves and dare to break through to try new things. It\u2019s considered good fortune too that they actually discovered such a super artiste such as my sis-in-law. Even I\u2019m a little envious!\u201d Lu Jingli immediately made a thumbs-up and corrected himself quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lick my boots.\u201d Ning Xi immediately stuffed the apple that she had just peeled into Lu Jingli\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>As he caught a glimpse of the shiny fruit knife in Ning Xi\u2019s hand, Lu Jingli smiled to flatter her. \u201cSis-in-law, what are you saying? What\u2019s my status? How could I be licking your boots? I only lick dragon boots\u2026 Haha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli changed the topic. \u201cSis-in-law, for \u2018Assassin\u2019, I remember that there\u2019s a male assassin character. I think that would suit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could remember this character clearly too.</p><br/><p>The old version of the male assassin was considered an important role too. Back then, Hollywood\u2019s famous comedian, Marlow, had played the character.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi still remembered some classic scenes of a man wearing a female disguise.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it! Mister Lu is handsome and confident. How could you possibly act as him? Don\u2019t ruin the dreams of thousands of girls!\u201d Ning Xi rolled her eyes at Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly you are so considerate of me, Sis-in-law!\u201d Lu Jingli looked touched.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the door creaked open.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao put his keys away and there were bags of fresh vegetables and meat in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, have you resolved the company matter?\u201d Lu Jingli promptly ran over to ask.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao walked into the kitchen, washed his hands and then returned to the living room. He simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s no bother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good if it\u2019s fine. That\u2019s good! I won\u2019t disturb you guys. I\u2019ll leave now!\u201d Lu Jingli was ready to slip away, reluctant to be force fed with their display of affection.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already here. Just stay for dinner!\u201d Ning Xi said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, well\u2026\u201d In between his fear of their intimate display of affection and the temptation of delicious food, Lu Jingli still chose to surrender to his appetite in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still Sis-in-law who cares about me. Let\u2019s just happily decide on that then!\u201d Lu Jingli instantly retreated back and sat down on the sofa to begin watching a movie.</p><br/><p>What a rare opportunity!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

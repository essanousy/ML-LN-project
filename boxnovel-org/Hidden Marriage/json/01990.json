She was playing video games with Tang Lang. U.p.dated by . com</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was eating a watermelon while squatting, and his white tiger was sleeping beside him.</p><br/><p>They were supposed to be facing attacks from groups and groups of assassins, yet in the end, it had become more like a vacation instead.</p><br/><p>She was really pleased that she got to spent a lot of sweet time with Lu Tingxiao at home.</p><br/><p>After Han Xiao was done with the watermelon, he threw the rind away in the bin and stared at the three on the sofa.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao then stood up and turned off the game console.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, what are you doing? I almost killed Ning Xiao Xi!\u201d Tang Lang complained.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless. \u201cDream on! Master saved you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to sleep, lock your doors,\u201d instructed Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was taken aback. Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao looked at each other.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Han Xiao used such a tone.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the assassin tonight had been tough?</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was not worried at all. He was very confident of a certain maniac, so he put on his slippers and went back to his bedroom.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at Lu Tingxiao as he gave her a comforting gaze then they went upstairs together.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao would never say something meaningless. If he asked them to go to bed, then they would just have to cooperate.</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi and the bunch went to bed, Han Xiao turned off all the lights, then lay down on the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The night was quiet till past midnight.</p><br/><p>A skinny-looking man appeared inside the house like a phantom.</p><br/><p>The doors were all locked, so no one knew how he got inside. It was as if this skinny man had been hiding there long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Xiao, you were lucky the last time. Tonight, you have to die,\u201d the skinny man blurted. There was no emotion in his eyes.</p><br/><p>He took out a dagger and went near the sofa, staring at the snoring Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>Some time ago, the skinny man had tried to assassinate Han Xiao in China and had almost succeeded.</p><br/><p>No matter what, he had to kill Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>The man whipped out a shining dagger.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>The dagger went straight to Han Xiao\u2019s heart without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Han Xiao suddenly opened his eyes and raised his right arm.</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>Han Xiao grabbed the skinny man\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The skinny man was dumbfounded, unable to believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Zhan, it\u2019s really late right now. What business do you have with me?\u201d Han Xiao stared at the skinny man and said expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! How did you notice me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan could not believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think I let Yorick go back?\u201d Han Xiao grinned.</p><br/><p>After Yorick and \u201cDoctor Death\u201d left, they would surely have told the European King\u2019s force about him being in Deer Town.</p><br/><p>Knowing that he was in Deer Town, the European King force would then surely get Xiao Zhan to assassinate him.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was well-prepared and would not make the same mistake again.</p><br/><p>He had been waiting to catch this man ever since he almost died the last time!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Zhan, it\u2019s true that your assassination skills are top-notch. However, even your master will need to be respectful to me. As for you, you\u2019re naughty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao mustered strength in his right arm, then tossed Xiao Zhan away.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A loud thud echoed through the house.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ning Xi shrugged and turned away as she waved her hands. \"Okay, it seems that I\u2019m mistaken. You couldn\u2019t possibly be my dear\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s wrist was suddenly grabbed and she was pulled into a warm hug with two strong arms wrapped around her. The man said in his deep voice, \"I am.\"</p><br/><p>He then wildly kissed the girl\u2019s lips\u2026</p><br/><p>In the dark alley, the girl was pushed against the wall and kissed fiercely. The breezy environment turned really warm.</p><br/><p>\"It hurts\u2026\" Ning Xi felt her tongue was going numb and there was a slight soreness on her lips as well, so she complained.</p><br/><p>The man kissed her even deeper. He practically wanted to merge into one with her. \"You naughty one\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi bit the man's lip gently. \"You\u2019re the naughty one! If it wasn\u2019t for the Little Treasure-branded father-seeking device, how long did you plan to hide from me?\"</p><br/><p>Little Treasure-brand father-seeking device\u2026</p><br/><p>That was an accurate name indeed\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Forever,\" Lu Tingxiao replied.</p><br/><p>If he had not been found out, he was prepared to continue hiding it from her!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was really angry. \"Then, why did you admit just now? You could\u2019ve denied it! I don\u2019t have any evidence anyway!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao sighed, \"You know that no matter what happens, I can never say no to that.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\" Ning Xi acted all high and mighty towards him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao loved to see her like this and he was about to kiss her again\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pushed him away. \"I\u2019m being serious with you! Let me ask you. is it because there are some dangerous scenes in this movie and you\u2019re worried?\"</p><br/><p>She remembered that Lu Tingxiao had asked Xiong Zhi to protect her, then that incident happened whereby she was almost killed in Philadelphia. With Lu Tingxiao\u2019s personality, he probably could not trust Xiong Zhi or anyone else to protect her anymore!</p><br/><p>Was that why he came personally?</p><br/><p>From what she knew, it was not easy to obtain such a well-made mask and these masks could cause damage to the skin. Wearing it for around 10 minutes was enough to make a person uncomfortable, yet he wore it for such a long time\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s heart softened.</p><br/><p>\"This is one of the reasons,\" Lu Tingxiao did not deny it as he looked at her, \"Another reason was for me. We\u2019re both really busy, plus we can\u2019t publicize our relationship, so the time we get to spend together is very little. I missed you.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m sorry\u2026\" Ning Xi felt all her anger dissolve.</p><br/><p>\"Besides, experiencing acting might help me to understand you better so that I can have some common topics to talk about with you, then you\u2019d probably find me less boring.\"</p><br/><p>\"No way! You\u2019re not boring at all! I like my Boss the most! The most!\" Ning Xi\u2019s dissatisfaction turned into a touching and heartfelt moment as she clung to the man\u2019s neck and kissed him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

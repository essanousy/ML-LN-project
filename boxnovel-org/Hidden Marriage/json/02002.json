I\u2019m overjoyed about it, but Su Yan said he\u2019s been pretty busy with Starlight lately and rarely comes back home\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Busy?</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan was a little taken aback.</p><br/><p>Because of Ning Xi\u2019s return, Starlight\u2019s artistes had been a little pressured recently, but compared to their peak period, there was nothing big going on. As the largest shareholder of Starlight, Su Yan did not need to involve himself with the small stuff, so just how busy was he to ignore his pregnant wife?</p><br/><p>Actually, the only action Su Yan took in the company was\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan came up with a shocking hypothesis in her mind. She tried to act calm and asked, \u201cVice CEO Ning, did you know that CEO Su wanted Ning Xi to come to Starlight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jealousy flashed in Ning Xueluo\u2019s eyes, but she put up an innocuous act and looked shocked. Her eyes widened and she looked at Han Zixuan in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2026 He wanted Ning Xi to come to Starlight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s reaction astounded Han Zixuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? I felt that it was odd. Why would CEO Su want Ning Xi to come back? She was chased out back then. Now that we recruit her back, isn\u2019t it telling everyone one that we don\u2019t have anyone talented in Starlight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression worsened and she looked down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she let Su Yan go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVice CEO Ning! Ning Xi, she\u2026 She\u2026 She and CEO Su\u2026\u201d Han Zixuan was floored once again.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo realized she had said too much. She covered her mouth and looked at Han Zixuan. \u201cNothing, it\u2019s nothing. She just knew Su Yan a long time ago. While Ning Xi loved Su Yan, it was a very long time ago. They are unrelated now\u2026 There\u2019s nothing between them now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s voice was becoming smaller and smaller. The helplessness in her tone could make a person weep.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan never expected the truth to be like this!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Su Yan had known each other from before?</p><br/><p>And Ning Xi was fond of Su Yan?</p><br/><p>This series of news was shocking for Han Zixuan. She remembered Su Yan\u2019s repeated attempts to invite Ning Xi over as she linked it to Ning Xueluo\u2019s pregnancy and Su Yan\u2019s excuse of not going back home\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi is too much! You\u2019re pregnant now! And she\u2019s seducing CEO Su! Is she even human? Not only did she force you to retire, now she wants to break you and CEO Su apart!\u201d Han Zixuan seemed mad, but she was happy on the inside.</p><br/><p>I thought you\u2019re something Ning Xi, yet you are just a shameless witch!</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan took a glance at the gap in the sofa. The dim reflection passed through her eyes under the light. It was a camera that she had prepared beforehand. She wanted to dig some dirt from Ning Xueluo, and\u2026 she now had something unexpectedly big.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo looked like she was on the verge of crying. She bit her lip and shook her head at Han Zixuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. Su Yan\u2026 He won\u2019t treat me like that. He\u2019s really busy, not\u2026 not because of Ning Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s voice started to waver, her expression telling everyone that she had been suffering from all these emotions all along.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan comforted Ning Xueluo as she plotted an evil plan.</p><br/><p><em>Ning Xi, I don\u2019t believe that you will survive this time!</em></p><br/><p>As for Ning Xueluo who was being comforted, she hid her wicked expression as she lowered her head.</p></div>\n</div>"}

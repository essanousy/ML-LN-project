What kind of look is that!\u201d Ning Yaohua flew into a rage.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to vent his temper, the door to the ward was opened from the inside.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua and Zhuang Linyu immediately tossed Ning Xi to the back of their minds and hurriedly went up to the door, \u201cSu Yan, how\u2019s Xueluo doing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine for now, you can go in to see her.\u201d Su Yan replied, looking tired. After that, he turned to look at Ning Xi, whose cheek was slightly swollen and red, with a heavy gaze.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu immediately threw herself by Ning Xueluo\u2019s bedside and looked her up and down, \u201cMummy\u2019s darling! How are you feeling? Does it hurt? Do you feel bad anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo smiled weakly, \u201cMum, I\u2019m fine now. The doctor said that it\u2019s just a superficial wound.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu stroked her hair tenderly, \u201cYou\u2019re a girl, and this wound is going to leave such a big scar. You\u2019re still saying that you\u2019ll be fine! If the sword had gone in just a little deeper, you wouldn\u2019t be alive now! That damn girl, how could she be so vicious! You even treat her as your older sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJiejie, she\u2026\u201d Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression dimmed down, but she bore with it and continued speaking, \u201cDad, Mum, don\u2019t blame jiejie. It\u2019s not her fault, something went wrong with the prop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua snorted coldly upon hearing so, \u201cSilly child, how could you be so silly! That prop was perfectly fine; how could something have gone wrong with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he turned to the door and shouted at Ning Xi, who was standing there, \u201cBastard, what are you still standing there for? Get in here and apologise to Xueluo right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s face held an indifferent expression like an impenetrable mask, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I have to apologise to her for. If you want to make me apologise, sure, show me the evidence. If you have evidence, then I can even give her my life as compensation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua\u2019s finger shook as he pointed at her, \u201cYou\u2019re still refusing to admit your mistake even now. I\u2019m leaving you some dignity by not investigating this matter. You\u2019re not going to repent until you see your end is near, are you? Do you just have to embarrass me thoroughly before you\u2019re satisfied?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heh, so in Ning Yaohua\u2019s eyes, it was his image that was the most important.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sneered, \u201cIf I really wanted to take revenge on her, you\u2019d be seeing her corpse now. How would you still have the chance to act out a family drama here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua slammed the table with force, \u201cStop running your mouth at me! Ning Xi, are you going to apologise or not? If you admit your wrongs and apologise, then retire from the entertainment industry, I can take it as if all of this never happened. If you want to have your way\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, but I choose to have my own way!\u201d Ning Xi burst out into laughter and waved them goodbye, before turning to leave without looking back.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s face was filled with disbelief, \u201cLook at how she\u2019s acting! I can\u2019t believe I gave birth to such a shameful thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua was so angry he had to pace, \u201cWhat a vile creature! She\u2019s really angered me now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo anxiously persuaded, \u201cDad, forget about it. I\u2019m fine now, don\u2019t get angry at Jiejie, you\u2019ll hurt your body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already let her off once last time, and she actually did such a thing. She tried to harm you this time, who knows if she might try to kill you the next time. I can\u2019t just forget about this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Dad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t think about this matter anymore. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, let your dad handle it. Just focus on recovering. Your dad will give you a satisfactory result!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s eyes reddened and she looked as if she was holding back her resentment from being bullied. With a grateful expression, she said, \u201cThanks Dad, thanks Mum. You don\u2019t have to do that, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan, who had been silent since just now, patted her shoulder, \u201cXueluo, you\u2019re just too kind! Ning Xi went overboard this time. Uncle\u2019s right. We can\u2019t let her continue acting so freely!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I haven\u2019t shaved for a few days now. The stubble is hard to bear\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The European elder shook his head, the sharp surgical blade continuing to move back and forth his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour chin is bleeding,\u201d Tang Lang ate his watermelon as he blinked and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 No problem, no problem. It\u2019s a small issue!\u201d The elder lifted his hand and used his sleeve to wipe off the blood traces.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to help you shave?\u201d Han Xiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no\u2026\u201d The elder quickly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be shy.\u201d Han Xiao tossed the watermelon rind straight into Yorick\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>When he saw that Yorick was slightly stunned, Han Xiao frowned and asked, \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, no problem at all. I wonder where the watermelon rind flew from. It\u2019s a small issue,\u201d assured Yorick.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao shrugged, then he took the European man\u2019s surgical blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand properly and don\u2019t move. Otherwise, I\u2019ll cut you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao finished and started to help the elder shave.</p><br/><p>When he finished shaving his beard, Han Xiao did not stop. He unexpectedly shaved off all of the elder\u2019s hair, shaving his head bald.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, why did you shave off his brows too?\u201d Tang Lang asked mirthfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pleasantly cool!\u201d Han Xiao answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it feel pleasantly cool?\u201d Then, Han Xiao turned to ask the European man.</p><br/><p>\u201cCool! Very fresh and cool!\u201d The European elderly repeatedly nodded, he was afraid that if he said anything wrong, he would offend this madman.</p><br/><p>When he heard, Han Xiao felt satisfied, he held the surgical blade and walked to Yorick\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Without any explanation, Yorick\u2019s thick mustache, brows, and hair had also been shaved clean.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it feel pleasantly cool?\u201d Han Xiao looked at Yorick and asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cCool! Thanks for the trouble, Master Xiao, I\u2019ve wanted to shave it all off for a long time. It feels really good.\u201d Yorick\u2019s face flashed with a flattering smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, everyone, that will be US$ 500 each.\u201d Han Xiao hurled out his hand.</p><br/><p>Yorick and the European elderly came back to their senses, they quickly searched themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Xiao, I didn\u2019t bring any money with me.I only have US$ 300\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have US$ 400\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yorick and the European man took out all of the US dollars on them and handed it over to Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou owe me US$ 100, you owe me US$ 200,\u201d Han Xiao counted and then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this? Let\u2019s follow China\u2019s bank interest rates to calculate. Don\u2019t forget to return me the money then,\u201d Han Xiao put the US$ 700 into his pocket.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, okay\u2026 Master Xiao, we still have some things to do, so we\u2019ll leave first. Later on, we\u2019ll send you the money\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yorick pulled away the European elder who was frozen where he was, wishing his parents had given him a few more pairs of legs to flee. He almost rolled and crawled out as they ran out of the house.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDude, buy more watermelons and get some meat.\u201d Han Xiao threw the US$ 700 at Tang Lang.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Grandfather,\u201d Tang Lang nodded and said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stood on the side. She was thoroughly impressed and bowled over in complete admiration.</p><br/><p>She had shaved off the brows, hair and moustache of the two assassins who were in the top ten Original Sin\u2019s rankings, plus he had even extorted US$ 700 from them.</p><br/><p>In the end, he had asked Tang Lang buy more watermelons and meat.</p><br/><p>US$ 700?! Bloody hell! How much watermelon and meat could that buy.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally understood that Han Xiao was an idiot through and through\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, why did you let them go? You should\u2019ve just kill them!\u201d Tang Lang kept the money in his pocket and grinned at Han Xiao to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them?\u201d Han Xiao was stunned. He looked at Tang Lang with a puzzled expression. \u201cWho were they?\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard him, Tang Lang and Ning Xi almost puked three liters of blood.</p><br/><p>They had done all that for so long, shaved all their hair and had even asked for US$ 700\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, Han Xiao actually did not know who the booth of them were and what they had come for\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ning Xi felt bad for the two assassins.</p><br/><p>It really was not easy for them!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

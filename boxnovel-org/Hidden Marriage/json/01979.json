I\u2019m worried about your logic, brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know about the truth of what happened very well,\u201d Lu Tingxiao said suddenly.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen\u2019s pupils shrunk. \u201cSo what?

He did not feel pleased at all. He smiled coldly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we trade? You get the Lu family, and I\u2019ll get Tang Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression turned cold. \u201cShe\u2019s not a tradeable item.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then left after saying those words.</p><br/><p>Behind him, Yun Shen\u2019s cold and sharp expression turned empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, boring\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Half a month later, Ning Xi and Jiang Muye returned to the country.</p><br/><p>The filming in Europe had gone smoothly.</p><br/><p>As the crew members still doubted Ning Xi at first, all of them shut their mouth after witnessing Ning Xi perfectly play the role of Anna.</p><br/><p>While Hollywood was not the most cordial place towards the Chinese, they were respectful towards people with true capabilities.</p><br/><p>Even Lilian was on amicable terms with Ning Xi now.</p><br/><p>There was news that Ning Xi was shopping with Lilian in Europe and that they even stayed at the same hotel.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi received a call the moment she landed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, dear, have you reached yet?\u201d There was the sweet voice of a woman over the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Lilian, I just got off the plane,\u201d Ning Xi replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! My dear! You know what? I just finished your movie \u2018The World\u2019. You\u2019re so awesome as Meng Changge!

They faced each other from dawn till dusk, and without realizing it, the both of them turned into good friends. It was a far cry from the tensed relationship they began with.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi walked out of the airport after she hung up.</p><br/><p>She could not wait to go back home.</p><br/><p>She would soon travel to other countries for more filming. During this period of rest, she wanted to spend time with her darling and Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>As she thought about something, there was a sense of worry in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Recently, she had been filming while being cut off from communication. She had just only found out there were huge tremors of economic crisis within the country with the Lu Corporation bearing the most damage.</p><br/><p>She wondered how things were with Lu Tingxiao\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went into the car and rushed back to Deer Town.

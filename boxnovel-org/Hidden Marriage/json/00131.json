Following that, he held up the plastic bags he was carrying, \u201cI bought chicken porridge for you so that you can regain your strength. Don\u2019t keep saying that you\u2019re tired now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The next scene followed closely after the previous one. It was a battle in the bamboo forest.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing that Meng Changge had already gone crazy and wouldn\u2019t listen to reason, after a moment of hesitation, Shangguan Yingrong was prepared to kill her to avoid trouble later on.</p><br/><p>After the martial arts instructor taught them for more than two hours, the two of them were almost done learning the moves.</p><br/><p>The director had been prepared to find stunt doubles for them at first, but since Ning Xi was rather good at martial arts and had even been a stunt double before, she definitely didn\u2019t need one. Ning Xueluo had then indicated that she wanted to try the scene herself.</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng naturally wanted the best effect for the movie, so he had agreed.</p><br/><p>The professional stunt master helped to set them up in their rigs. After checking a few times and confirming that everything was set up properly, filming started.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Changge is already dead.\u201d Shangguan Yingrong shut her eyes and spoke with heartache and regret.</p><br/><p>The person standing in front of her was just a beautiful and dangerous shell, a weapon that was going to destroy this kingdom.</p><br/><p>In the next second, murderous intent surged up in Shangguan Yingrong\u2019s eyes. At the same time, she drew the sword at her waist and charged towards Meng Changge\u2026</p><br/><p>As if she had already predicted Shangguan Yingrong\u2019s actions, Meng Changge stood calmly on the spot. It wasn\u2019t until the sword was already inches away from her nose that she moved. Just by stretching out both arms and touching the ground with the tips of her toes, she flew backwards like a bird and avoided Shangguan Yingrong\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yingrong breathed out coldly and took up her sword again.</p><br/><p>Meng Changge took her time to dodge Shangguan Yingrong\u2019s attacks. It was like a cat toying with a mouse. Finally, she casually drew the sword she carried on the waist of her red dress and started to counterattack with fierce moves.</p><br/><p>After just ten or so moves, Shangguan Yingrong was on the losing end. She was almost pushed off the bamboo branches a few times.</p><br/><p>Even though Shangguan Yingrong had some skill with the sword, she was like an infant before the mighty general who had slain entire armies, Meng Changge.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yingrong had overestimated herself. She had thought that Meng Changge\u2019s skills would have rusted away after concealing herself in the palace for so long. Who would have thought that she wasn\u2019t even a match for Meng Changge? However, it was already too late when she realised that she had underestimated her enemy.</p><br/><p>In the end, Meng Changge finally had enough of playing around. Her gaze turned chilly as her sword pierced straight towards Shangguan Yingrong\u2019s chest with the force of ten thousand soldiers\u2026</p><br/><p>Shirk\u2013</p><br/><p>It was the sound of a sharp blade entering a body.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yingrong held onto her chest, pain written all over her face. Like a kite with a broken string, she tumbled from the sky above the sea of bamboo\u2026</p><br/><p>Next, there was supposed to be a close-up featuring Meng Changge\u2019s expression. Guo Qisheng was watching Ning Xi\u2019s performance with rapt attention, but found that there was something wrong with Ning Xi\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xueluo is hurt! Save her! Quickly!\u201d Still suspended in midair on wires, Ning Xi suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>After everyone froze blankly for a moment, they realised that that wasn\u2019t a line and that Ning Xueluo was really hurt!</p><br/><p>The set turned into a frenzied mess as everyone surrounded Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>After being let down from the wire, Ning Xi hurriedly pressed down on the wound on Ning Xueluo\u2019s chest that was spewing blood, \u201cQuick, call the ambulance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after she finished speaking, she was suddenly pushed away with great force. Su Yan flew over, pale with fright. He carried Ning Xueluo in his arms tightly, \u201cXueluo! Xueluo! What happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan-gege\u2026 It hurts so much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, I\u2019m here! You\u2019ll be fine! You\u2019ll definitely be alright\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It's already very commendable that she could perform this way!\"</p><br/><p>He saw that Fang Ya was unsatisfied and continued, \"Later on, please put in more effort into your scene with Xiaoqi. She can only follow if you're focused, understand?\"</p><br/><p>\"Director, it\u2019s her\u2026\" Fang Ya was exasperated. Was now her fault that Guan Xiaoqi had bad acting skills?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone around started to change their attitude. \"The director makes sense, at first I thought it was all Guan Xiaoqi\u2019s fault, but think about it, Fang Ya had some problems as well!\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure is! Otherwise, how would Guan Xiaoqi be able to do a one shot take with Ning Xi!\"</p><br/><p>\"Guan Xiaoqi has bad acting skills, but Fang Ya isn\u2019t that great either, it\u2019s like the pot calling the kettle black!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After the scene was over, Guan Xiaoqi skipped happily back to the resting area.</p><br/><p>One assistant helped fanned her and the other gave her water, gladly welcoming her.</p><br/><p>\"Miss, you were great just now!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, you got it at the first shot! Marvelous acting!\"</p><br/><p>Guan Xiaoqi said proudly, \"I told you that my acting has no problem! It\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t act well when I see Fang Ya\u2019s face, it makes me sick! Don't you trust me now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I do! Miss, you\u2019re the best! It\u2019s all Fang Ya\u2019s fault!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glanced at Guan Xiaoqi\u2019s direction, then walked over to Guo Qisheng\u2019s side, \"Director, how was the scene? Were there any problems?\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem! It was great!\" Guo Qisheng said with a face full of life.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi acted casually and said, \"Director, I think Guan Xiaoqi is in shape right now. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to start shooting the next scene right now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, you have a point, I\u2019ll let them prepare the next scene immediately! Oh right, you should attend to your urgent matter now!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, thank you, director!\" Ning Xi nodded before she left.</p><br/><p>Xiao Tao followed Ning Xi with a doubtful look, \"Sis Xi, what\u2019s up with Guan Xiaoqi? She passed on first take! Must be her luck?\"</p><br/><p>\"Maybe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I knew it! Sis Xi you have something urgent? Do you need my help?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, you can get off work now!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, thank you, Sis Xi!\" She thought she would have to work overtime tonight, but in the end she could get off earlier, so Xiao Tao left happily.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finished removing her make up and changed her outfit, then walked along the corridor towards the hotel.</p><br/><p>Suddenly an arm reached over and hooked onto her shoulder, \"Tsk tsk, Ning Xiao Xi, how nice of you, playing the hero now?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pushed Jiang Muye\u2019s arm away and brushed off the non-existent dust on her shoulder. \"Why, do you have a problem with it?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye just put his arm over her again, \"Aren\u2019t you the type to not meddle in other people\u2019s business? Why are you helping the nasty Guan Xiaoqi this time?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi touched her chin, \"Guan Xiaoqi kind of helped me before, so I'm just returning the favor. I don\u2019t like to owe people. Moreover, not taking into account of her behavior and personality, I can see that she really loves acting\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She felt positive about people who truly loved and were passionate about acting.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was speechless, \"You\u2019re so tender and cherishing towards her!\"</p><br/><p>\"You don\u2019t need to care if I\u2019m tender or cherishing!\" Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, \"I thought there weren\u2019t any scenes of you today? Why are you here?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She became so popular. We had even hoped that... hoped that she could be less popular... so that we could buy her more time... even if it was for one more day\u2026</p><br/><p>\"In the end, we put in so much effort, but we got the worst results possible\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Three months, for three whole months, Ning Xi didn't wake up.</p><br/><p>\"The doctors said that in her condition, her chances of waking up was near to impossible after three months\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Xu Tao narrated what had happened back then to everyone in detail. Everyone could feel the sadness and despair emanating from her.</p><br/><p>Then, with a sarcastic tone, she continued, \"Everyone knows what happened afterwards.

When he woke up, it was already midnight. He quickly asked a nearby waiter, then found out that the people in the room had already left.</p><br/><p>The miserable Lu Jingli could only go straight to her place.</p><br/><p>When he was about to leave, he heard a familiar voice. It sounded like Ning Xueluo, and he heard Ning Xi's name being mentioned\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli stepped back and hid in an empty room.</p><br/><p>\"Xueluo, are you alright?!

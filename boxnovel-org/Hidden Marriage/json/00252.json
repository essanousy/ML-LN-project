Sister Xi, you don\u2019t know?\u201d Xiao Tao asked with a look of surprise. Then she conspiringly leaned towards Ning Xi\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cSu Yi Mo\u2019s backing ah\u2026\u2026it\u2019s President Lu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Lu? Lu Jingli?\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s first reaction is Lu Jingli. In her heart, as Lu Jingli has no moral integrity\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Tao abruptly shook her head, then pointed upwards, meaning the people above Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>This caused Ning Xi to be somewhat surprised. Raising a brow, she asked, \u201cLu Ting Xiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Tao nodded, then looked around nervously before whispering, \u201cShh\u2026\u2026In short, just know it in your heart and don\u2019t say it out loud.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi touched her chin thoughtfully, \u201cBut why is it that there\u2019s no wind of such juicy gossip at all outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would dare speculate about Big Boss ah? That\u2019s why only the people in our company know about it!\u201d Xiao Tao explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Ning Xi to ask for more details, Xiao Tao was unable to hold back any longer and directly began gossiping, \u201cIn the beginning, Su Yi Mo was just going back and forth between B and C-list. There were people above her who were more popular everywhere. In the end, don\u2019t know how but, she managed to seduce our Big Boss, and even got in his good grace. Then suddenly, all of the company\u2019s resources were given to her to pick and choose, and just like a rocket, she rapidly rise to success\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Tao felt angrier the more she said, and resentfully said, \u201cOur Sister Manyun fought hard with perseverance and consistency to attain today\u2019s achievements, yet she was suppressed just like that, it\u2019s too unfair\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing how logical Xiao Tao was, Ning Xi believed that such thing really did happen, but, what exactly was the relationship between Su Yi Mo and Lu Ting Xiao\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Tao did not say it explicitly, but from her tone, it was like\u2026\u2026\u2019slept together\u2019 relationship?</p><br/><p>But, from Ning Xi\u2019s understanding of Lu Ting Xiao, she naturally did not believe Xiao Tao\u2019s gossips fully.</p><br/><p>Xiao Tao, who was talking without cease, suddenly had the self realization that she was boosting other people\u2019s power and prestige and felt that it was inappropriate. Thus she hurriedly consoled Ning Xi, \u201cCough, but then, Sister Xi, your backing is also very powerful; you were personally scouted by our Second Young Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Tao said it like that, but there was disappointment in her tone.</p><br/><p>She was originally Leng Manyun\u2019s assistant. She was transferred over with Lin Zhizhi to assist Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Last time, when she was with Leng Manyun, people showed her respect wherever she was. As compared Leng Manyun, Ning Xi was just a small newbie, and she was now Ning Xi\u2019s assistant. When she thought of how she needed to bow down to Su Yi Mo\u2019s agent and assistant in the future, she inevitably felt unhappy.</p><br/><p>How could Ning Xi possibly missed the disappointment on Xiao Tao\u2019s face, but then, Xiao Tao\u2019s reaction was normal, so she did not take it to the heart.</p><br/><p>Just that, Su Yi Mo was a problem, so she would not just let the matter slide\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After all, these seven days to her was of great importance, and any little mishap can affect her decision.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ning Xi did not waste any effort to blindly guess. She took out her phone and gave him a text\u2013\u2013\u2013</p><br/><p>[What is your relationship with Su Yi Mo?]</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at Lu Group.</p><br/><p>Inside the conference room, Lu Ting Xiao was currently having a meeting. At this moment, the phone at his side vibrated.</p><br/><p>While listening to his subordinate\u2019s report, Lu Ting Xiao glanced at his phone.</p><br/><p>Then, all of the subordinate who were in the room saw a super rare scene\u2013\u2013\u2013</p><br/><p>Their Big Boss, who hardly ever gave a smile, was actually looking at his phone, his features were warmly smoothed out, and a pleasant smile could be seen\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

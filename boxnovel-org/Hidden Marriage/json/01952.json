This Caucasian girl was acting as the male lead\u2019s assistant in \u201cAssassin\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing! You actually got the role of the lead female assassin, so you\u2019ll have a lot of scenes with Weir,\u201d said the Caucasian girl with envy.</p><br/><p>Even though the outside world did not know anything yet, the fact that the female lead had been changed to be a Chinese actress exploded in the entire internal department.</p><br/><p>As for landing the role of the female lead, even Ning Xi herself felt that she had been incredibly lucky. After all, Ning Xi did not even dream of getting the female lead role in \u201cAssassin\u201d at first.</p><br/><p>However, since she had already gotten it, she would obviously give it her best.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Ms. Ning Xi, you should be a little careful,\u201d the Caucasian girl looked around as she said in a lowered voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful?\u201d Ning Xi did not understand.</p><br/><p>The Caucasian girl nodded and added softly, \u201cFor the role of the female lead, the filming crew initially already decided upon Lilian to take it up, but after they informed that they would be changing to you, Lilian has now been changed to be the villainous secondary female lead\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lilian was a movie star that had been pretty hot in Hollywood in recent years. When \u201cAssassin\u201d was about to be remade, they had already contacted Lilian and after an audition, they decided upon Lilian to play the female lead.</p><br/><p>However, with Ning Xi\u2019s arrival, the film producers\u2019 decision suddenly changed. Evidently, many of the higher-ups did not know why they had suddenly changed actresses either. Everyone was extremely curious about Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>The Caucasian woman seemed to be worried about Lilian, so she was warning Ning Xi to be more careful.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi already knew about this. She had also especially asked Jace about the situation, thus she did not take it to heart.</p><br/><p>Jace had decided on the lead female role in \u201cAssassin\u201d. It was not related to her at all and she did not even steal it herself, so with a clear conscience, she would just give it her all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Lilian\u2019s role as the female lead has actually been swapped out for a Chinese actress! I don\u2019t know what the producers are thinking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI previously heard that that Chinese actress is called whats-her-name? Ning Xi? Even though she\u2019s a little famous in China, she\u2019s not even qualified in Hollywood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, two dark-skinned girls walked into the makeup room.</p><br/><p>Their gazes fell onto Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>One of the girls examined Ning Xi and scoffed, \u201cChinese actresses who want to make it big in Hollywood really don\u2019t have it easy. No matter how many Hollywood movies they\u2019ve acted in, they still need to leave in the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll always be people who want to make it into Hollywood, yet in the end, almost none of them get to stay!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark-skinned women were clearly saying those things for Ning Xi to hear.</p><br/><p>Before they could continue, a few of the makeup artists finally rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, everyone. I\u2019m the makeup artist. Today the filming crew has told us to test costumes with everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman who was the makeup artist had a broad smile on her face.</p><br/><p>When they heard her, the two women stopped their nasty banter. They sat on the chairs and were checking themselves out in the mirrors.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman walked up to Ning Xi and introduced herself, \u201cHello, Ms. Ning Xi. My name is Lisa and I\u2019m your makeup artist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, thank you for the trouble.\u201d Ning Xi nodded.</p></div>\n</div>"}

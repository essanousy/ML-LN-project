Reply me in 10 seconds.\"</p><br/><p>Following the short sentence, Lu Tingxiao hung up and sat there waiting for his reply.</p><br/><p>Time went on\u2026</p><br/><p>As Tang Lang was counting down to ten seconds in secret, Lu Tingxiao received a notification on his phone.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao glanced at his inbox, then he spoke to the pilot, \"Turn around. Inform everyone Country F, E 31, N\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was shocked when he heard Lu Tingxiao read out the address, and even with accurate coordinates.</p><br/><p>Who did Lu Tingxiao call? That person was able to find out the location in ten seconds!</p><br/><p>You could not even finish watching the video in ten seconds!</p><br/><p>Unless the person knew the moment he saw the video, then sent Lu Tingxiao the email...</p><br/><p>Tang Lang reminded himself about the number Lu Tingxiao called just now and he was stunned.</p><br/><p>He remembered!</p><br/><p>That... that was one of Satan's personal numbers!</p><br/><p>Had Lu Tingxiao called him?</p><br/><p>The more shocking fact was that Satan had actually sent him the address.</p><br/><p>Was he not the person who kidnapped them?</p><br/><p>Tang Lang looked suspicious. \"Satan...

He had left the organization earlier and had no idea about it. This place was probably their last hand\u2026</p><br/><p>If it was not Yun Shen... probably no one would know this place\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao started emitting an intense horrifying vibe as he knew Ning Xi and Little Treasure were somewhere near the building behind them, but they were being blocked by this group of people.</p><br/><p>However, even if they had the upper hand, it would take some time to finish them all.</p><br/><p>At the very moment, a silver helicopter descended.

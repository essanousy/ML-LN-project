Why did First Senior brother get three broken, Feng Xiaoxiao had two broken, you didn\u2019t break any, and I got so many broken bones!? Just how did she gauge how many to break? I usually treat her pretty well, don\u2019t I? That girl is biased!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang looked so downcast.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him.</p><br/><p>Could he stop placing the focus on the wrong things?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Little Treasure?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s stabilized now. Grandfather is here and is now with Little Treasure!\u201d Tang Lang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster is here? I want to go over!\u201d Ning Xi quickly got up.</p><br/><p>In Little Treasure\u2019s ward.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was checking on Little Treasure when Ning Xi and Tang Lang came over.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not disturb him when Han Xiao was focusing.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao checked his pulse, then looked throughout his whole body. He did not seem impressed. \u201cIt\u2019s a similar method with the Qin family. You guys offended a descendent of the Qin family, didn\u2019t you? But they are really cruel, aren\u2019t they, harming a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, do you know what poison it is?\u201d Ning Xi quickly asked.</p><br/><p>Even though Yun Shen has heard of such poison before, he had no idea where it came from.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis poison came from an ancient martial arts family. It\u2019s a special secret recipe from the Qin family,\u201d replied Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how to cure it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao shook his head. \u201cNope, I told you before I can only treat external wounds and know nothing else. Moreover, the poison in him was planted right about when he was born, so it\u2019s deeply rooted inside his bone marrow. Also, the poison inside him is slightly different from the version I know. It went through mutation, so nothing will help even if I get you the cure of the version I know of. It can only be cured by the person who used this poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be like this?\u201d Ning Xi fell into despair.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was in doubt. \u201cThis is odd. I checked him just now. Under normal circumstances, the poison should\u2019ve been triggered two years ago. Why would it have been delayed until now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I don\u2019t know too\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was confused.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao handed Han Xiao a tiny fragrance pouch. \u201cIs it because of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was surprised to see that fragrance pouch. \u201cIs that the fragrance pouch Annie gave Little Treasure two years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao smelled the fragrant pouch and squinted his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s because of this. This is similar with the medical pouch earlier, but this lost its effectiveness because it\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason for the late development of the poison was finally revealed.</p><br/><p>However, Ning Xi had more questions. \u201cWhy would Annie give me this fragrance pouch to delay Little Treasure\u2019s poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not time yet?\u201d Tang Lang guessed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi kept quiet as she tried to remember what had happened when Annie first met her in Imperial.</p><br/><p>When Annie found out about her relationship with Lu Tingxiao, she seemed very against Lu Tingxiao, and had even warned her about the cons of being a stepmother. She kept trying to convince Ning Xi to leave Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, she realized that Ning Xi was genuinely in love with Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure, and with Little Treasure being so adorable, she changed her attitude, even giving Little Treasure this fragrance pouch.</p></div>\n</div>"}

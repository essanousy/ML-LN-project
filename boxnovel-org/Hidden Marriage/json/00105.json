She was close to screaming, \u201cNing Xi, you mad woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of Ning Xi trying to compete for her position and her man, but she was afraid that Ning Xi would reveal everything in a desperate bid to drag her down.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hehe\u2026\u201d Seeing that Ning Xueluo\u2019s face had turned pale from fright, Ning Xi couldn\u2019t resist chuckling. With a relaxed expression, she patted her shoulder, \u201cMiss Ning, don\u2019t worry~ I\u2019m just joking. It\u2019s not worth the sacrifice to take down trash like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking up to here, Ning Xi\u2019s indifferent gaze turned extremely cold and she lowered her tone. As if she was a ghost that had crawled out of hell, she spoke by Ning Xueluo\u2019s ear, \u201cHowever, if you ever use that incident to threaten me again, I can\u2019t guarantee what I\u2019ll do if I lose control. If you try to use that pig of a teammate, even if I die, I\u2019ll drag you down with me! Jia Qingqing is a pushover who only looks strong; but I\u2019m not the same as her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said so, Ning Xi let go of Ning Xueluo\u2019s shoulder and left.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo had not managed to threaten her at all, and had even been threatened herself. Once Ning Xi had left, she immediately collapsed on the floor. With a dark expression, she kicked the door heavily.</p><br/><p>Damn it! She had to think of a way to get rid of Ning Xi!</p><br/><p>As long as Ning Xi lived, everything that she had could disappear in a second. She absolutely could not let that happen!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After leaving the company, seeing that she had nothing else to do for the afternoon, Ning Xi prepared to go to the mall. She had promised that she would help Little Treasure buy some clothes.</p><br/><p>Upon thinking of Little Treasure, the dark clouds in her mind instantly dissipated and she happily went shopping.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi headed straight for the children\u2019s section upon arriving.</p><br/><p>There were all sorts of kids\u2019 clothing around. All pumped up, Ning Xi buried her head into shopping, she was even more crazy than when she shopped for herself.</p><br/><p>Since she had met Little Treasure, her way of living had turned a complete 180. She used to make detours around any shops that sold children\u2019s products or clothes. However, it wasn\u2019t those suffocating memories she thought about when she saw those now. Instead, she thought of the cute little bun.</p><br/><p>The feeling of wanting to buy something cute and fun back for him; it was practically like falling in love!</p><br/><p>This mall only carried branded products, so everything was rather expensive. It was the same for children\u2019s clothing, but since they were meant for Little Treasure, she was willing to spend the money. She just had to buy fewer cosmetic products to save the money back up.</p><br/><p>Today, Ning Xi was wearing a dress from a designer that she liked, but wasn\u2019t very famous. Although it looked good, it didn\u2019t have a branded logo on it.</p><br/><p>The shop assistants would only serve those who looked rich, so they didn\u2019t bother with her. They followed eagerly behind another woman dressed in Chanel from head to toe instead.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi happily shopped here and there. Finally, she spotted an outfit that piqued her interest in the corner.</p><br/><p>It was a little sapphire blue suit. Not only was the colour extremely eye-catching, the pocket square even carried a little Superman logo. Most importantly, she had lots of clothes with Superman motifs. She could wear matching mother-child outfits with Little Treasure at any time.</p><br/><p>The words \u2018mother-child outfits\u2019 made Ning Xi\u2019s heart thump. She realised with a start that while this felt like she was in love, where she would want to give the best to her lover, it also felt like how she would treat her own child.</p><br/><p>With a complicated expression on her face, Ning Xi sunk into silence for a while before finally recovering her senses. She approached a shop assistant, \u201cMiss, I want this outfit, could you help me pack it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop assistant didn\u2019t reply immediately, but reminded her coldly, \u201cThis costs twelve thousand yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I saw the tag. Help me pack it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop assistant\u2019s expression warmed up a little and she even smiled, saying gently, \u201cDo you need it to be wrapped as a present?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Ning Xi could reply, a hand with a jade bracelet suddenly came from the side and snatched away the outfit, \u201cOh, this outfit looks good! I\u2019m taking this!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

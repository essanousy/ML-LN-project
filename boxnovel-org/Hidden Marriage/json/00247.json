But the next moment, he went straight for the confession and asked her to marry him. It was simply an entrapment\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTeachers show the way, but the execution is left to the student.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao replied in a very rational tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis teacher did not teach you to behave like an ass!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this was the only way to make you know that the person I like is you, teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are offending your teacher as a student!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the teacher is too irresistible\u2026\u2026\u201dLu Ting Xiao leaned his forehead against hers, his large hands picked up hers and placed them over his heart. At that moment, his cold eyes looked as fiery as volcanic lava. In a tone as if he was under a spell, he said, \u201cTeacher, if you agree to be with me, my everything will be yours\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak anymore!!!\u201d Ning Xi interrupted, her brain in chaos. Especially when he called her teacher, she felt a strange kind of shameful embarrassment\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She tried to cover her ears, but, she was one step too late.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao went on to say \u2013 \u201cLittle Treasure will be yours too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s pupils contracted.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao quietly observed her reaction, seeing her eyes widen as she stared at him, his lips curled, and gently kneaded the sensitive areas at the back of her neck like he was playing with a cat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the percentage now?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao asked her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi subconsciously replied, \u201cHalf and half\u2026.\u201d She started and immediately wanted to bite her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you Lu Ting Xiao. You are too shameless! You even use Little Treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure is my natural asset. How can you say I\u2019m using him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about you using this honey trap on me?!\u201d Ning Xi replied indignantly. She was currently completely swept by the flow and she wanted to get away. Even though Lu Ting Xiao is currently not using any force to hurt her, but she was unable to break free.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I use it?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao replied in an innocent tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk fine you didn\u2019t, I used it myself alright! Uh\u2026\u2026Lu\u2026\u2026Ting Xiao\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was currently in an angry state, then speaking halfway she felt something was off.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned pale as she clutched her stomach, \u201cI\u2026\u2026.my stomach hurts\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Where does it hurt?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao asked as his face immediately became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy stomach! I\u2019m dying! The pain is increasing\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s forehead was covered with sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why will you have a stomach ache when everything was alright? Was it the food?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi coughed loudly, \u201cUh, it shouldn\u2019t be\u2026\u2026I think\u2026\u2026it might be because\u2026\u2026I drank a large glass of orange juice just now. At that time, I already felt that my stomach wasn\u2019t feeling quite right\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao looked at the table, only to find out that she had eaten most of the food on table, not to mention she also drank a large glass of juice. He instantly felt angry and said, \u201cNing Xi! Are you an idiot? How can you eat so much food and not stop?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi with even more angry. \u201cWasn\u2019t it because of you! I was so scared that I kept eating to reduce the stress. You also drank all the wine and didn\u2019t leave a drop for me! I could only drink the orange juice! And you actually called me an idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>She then clutched her stomach howling \u201cOwwwww\u201d looking even more miserable.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s anger instantly disappeared and hurried to comfort her, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll take you to the hospital immediately!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

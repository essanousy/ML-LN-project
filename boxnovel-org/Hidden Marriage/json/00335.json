Eh? Guan Xiaoqi\u2019s expression\u2026actually looked good!</p><br/><p>Next, Ning Xi looked at her disdainfully as if she was looking at a corpse, \"Princess Xian, do you know why I hate you so much? Why I must take away your chances of surviving?\"</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi finished her lines, Guo Qisheng's eyebrows knitted and he was already prepared to stop after Guan Xiaoqi\u2019s first line. The cameraman was adjusting his equipment casually as well.</p><br/><p>All the crew members and artiste had had enough of Guan Xiaoqi\u2019s usual arrogant ways, and everyone was waiting to see a good show\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Witch! You\u2019re jealous of me! You\u2019re jealous that the emperor likes me! Jealous that I\u2019m favored!\" Guan Xiaoqi read out her lines angrily, as her eyes became red. Damn it! Fang Ya and all these people, all of them, they were jealous of her!</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked by Guan Xiaoqi\u2019s lines.</p><br/><p>Eh?! She didn\u2019t misread any of her lines, and actually had a really good expression and tone...</p><br/><p>Maybe it was luck!</p><br/><p>Even Guan Xiaoqi was shocked herself, but Ning Xi quickly continued her lines to avoid her losing focus.</p><br/><p>\"Huh, me, jealous? Jealous that you are favored by that dumb old man?\"</p><br/><p>Guan Xiaoqi went along with Ning Xi\u2019s line and acted the next part naturally. She pulled an unbelievable face, \"Princess De! You\u2026Are you mad? I want to talk to the emperor! I will tell the emperor that you insulted\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi made Guan Xiaoqi back off with a harsh stare, and then spoke, \"Princess Liang, do you know who I am? Do you still remember\u2026the name of Meng Changge?\"</p><br/><p>As everyone watched up to this point, they held their breath and stared intensely. The atmosphere was tense, and they were whispering in disbelief: \"Guan Xiaoqi is in luck, she hasn\u2019t gotten cut off up till now!\"</p><br/><p>Fang Ya laughed coldly, \"Hehe, it will be anytime soon, just wait and see!\"</p><br/><p>\"True, Jia Qingqing was cut off at the next line for 33 times!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>With Ning Xi\u2019s gloomy stare, Guan Xiaoqi\u2019s face was full of fear, \"You\u2019re Meng Changge? How is it possible that you\u2019re Meng Changge? Meng Changge is already dead! This is impossible! Impossible!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi closed in slowly, \"Zhao Wanrou, if you\u2019re not dead yet, why would I be? Even if I was dead, I would crawl right back up from hell! Then I'll pull you down to die with me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah! Don\u2019t you come over here\u2026Don\u2019t come over\u2026\" Guan Xiaoqi screamed in fear.</p><br/><p>Zhang Rui reminded the director: \"Director\u2026cut! Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Thanks to the co-director\u2019s reminder, the director returned to his senses and quickly shouted, \"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>This scene\u2026had actually passed\u2026on the first take\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment Guo Qisheng shouted \"Cut!\", no one reacted. It was only after a while that everyone started discussing excitedly:</p><br/><p>\"Oh my god! Did the sun just rise from the west? Guan Xiaoqi actually passed?\"</p><br/><p>\"And it was on first take!\"</p><br/><p>\"This is too shocking!\"</p><br/><p>\"What has gotten into her?!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fang Ya had a livid expression, as she stood up and objected, \"How is this possible! Director, how could you let her pass? She\u2026she didn\u2019t do well at all! Her expressions and actions were too exaggerated!\"</p><br/><p>[1] Cold Palace - it is where disfavored queen or concubines was placed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

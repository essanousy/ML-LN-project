It seemed like Su Yan was there.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo looked at the glass of water on the coffee table, then she plastered a creepy smile across her face.</p><br/><p>Without Ning Xi realizing it, there were three white pills in Ning Xueluo\u2019s palm. She dropped those pills into the water and they quickly dissolved.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo picked the glass of water up. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault that you want to go down the path of death\u2026 then\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t blame me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She then chugged the glass of water.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression changed. The glass broke as it dropped onto the floor and caused a loud crash.</p><br/><p>Blood frothed out from Ning Xueluo\u2019s mouth as she clutched her stomach and started rolling on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cXueluo!!!\u201d Su Yan heard the noises from inside the room and barged in. He was horrified to find Ning Xueluo on the ground with the broken glass beside her, and the growing pool of blood on her lower body.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was sitting at her table. She did not move an inch during the whole fiasco.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo gripped her stomach and stared at the broken glass. \u201cThis water\u2026 Sister\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi grinned. Before Ning Xueluo could say anything, she interrupted her. \u201cI know you want to accuse me of poisoning you. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have security cameras in here. If not, you\u2019d have solid proof. However, the glass isn\u2019t worth a thing, so you can take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo froze when she heard Ning Xi\u2019s sarcastic words, but then she soon switched into a painful expression. \u201cSister\u2026 I came here today to discuss things with you\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter what you want to do to me\u2026 I just hope that\u2026 you don\u2019t hurt other innocent people\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why are you so stubborn? The one in my womb\u2026 is Bro Yan\u2019s child\u2026 The child is innocent\u2026 Mother\u2019s child is already gone\u2026 Is that not enough? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXueluo! Xueluo!\u201d Su Yan quickly held up the unconscious Xueluo, then he looked at Ning Xi with a mixed expression before he dashed out.</p><br/><p>Su Yan held Xueluo and ran through the staff area and the lobby, sparking a lot of discussion.</p><br/><p>In the office, Ning Xi looked at the direction Su Yan left in, contemplating something.</p><br/><p>In Ning Xi\u2019s house in Deer Town.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi made two phone calls immediately after she reached home.</p><br/><p>She soon got replies from both sides.</p><br/><p>The first call was to Shi Xiao, who confirmed that Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s child was gone and that it happened after someone hit her on purpose on a motorbike.</p><br/><p>She would probably be blamed, but they did not have evidence. If not, Zhuang Lingyu would have already sent her to jail and Ning Xueluo would not have come to the company to put on the act, even getting rid of her own child to frame her as well.</p></div>\n</div>"}

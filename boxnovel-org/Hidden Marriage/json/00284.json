How about I get the driver to fetch you? Hello? Hello?\"</p><br/><p>The other end of the phone was silent, only quiet sounds of held back tears were heard. Su Yan immediately asked, \"Xueluo, what\u2019s wrong? Are you crying? What\u2019s happened?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo choked on her tears and said, \"Yan, I\u2019m really sad...everyone in the drama team is ostracizing me. They\u2019re all fawning over Ning Xi and Jiang Muye, no one will speak to me\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Just now, I was just asking Ning Xi out of concern about her and Jiang Muye. I told her that if she needed money she could ask from me, that she shouldn\u2019t do anything stupid. She said many mean things in return instead, and even said that I don\u2019t deserve to care about her\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Su Yan sighed and said, \"Xueluo, rumours about Xiao Xi and Jiang Muye\u2019s scandal have already been making rounds recently. Your question might come across as an interrogation, that\u2019s why she\u2019s unhappy about it. You even asked her if she needed money, clearly implying that she\u2019s getting her money from Jiang Muye.\"</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Su Yan just gave such a casual reply, causing Ning Xueluo to clench her first further. \"Yan, you\u2019ve changed! Just because of that incident, now no matter what happens you\u2019ll only believe Ning Xi, won\u2019t you? She and Jiang Muye\u2019s scandal has already been photographed by fans, plus they are usually already so close within the drama team, who wouldn\u2019t know about their relationship? Need I say more?\"</p><br/><p>\"Xueluo, it isn\u2019t I who has changed, it\u2019s you who has a problem with your mentality. You\u2019re such an understanding person, why can\u2019t you try to be on Xiao Xi\u2019s side and choose to believe her? Even if she really did have anything going on with Jiang Muye, can\u2019t it just be normal dating? If that is so, we should wish her the best!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yan, I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I have to go back to work now. I\u2019ll talk to you again when I\u2019m free.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi returned to the room, everyone had already finished eating and were singing.</p><br/><p>\"I can never look back, I will write my own rules. The fierce flashing eyes of the werewolf\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye made everyone cheer with his song. When Ning Xi returned, he quickly called her over to sing, \"Ning Xiao Xi, sing us a song! Your favourite is still \u2018The Boundless Sea and Sky\u2019, right?\"</p><br/><p>This was a must-sing song for Ning Xi every time she went to the KTV. Every single time she had to sing, \"Forgive me in this lifetime for I won\u2019t let love be free\".</p><br/><p>But today, Ning Xi waved and said, \"I\u2019ll choose by myself!\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you going to choose?\" Jiang Muye looked over, worried that she would choose a song that was too extreme.</p><br/><p>Once Ning Xi chose her song, she leaned on the sofa and picked up the microphone to begin singing\u2014</p><br/><p>\"Look at what is before me with the lights on: the huge room, lonely bed. Without the lights, they were all invisible, the hurt in the heart, with no one to share\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was shocked, \"Jesus! Ning Xi, your style has changed a little too quickly, hasn\u2019t it? Where\u2019s the Ning Xi who enjoys singing about animals, flesh, and toxic?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, \"This is not a private gathering, do you think I would sing that kind of song at this occasion?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi once said that a lot of the songs she knew were not underage-friendly, so she wasn\u2019t kidding. The three songs Jiang Muye just mentioned were the classics.</p><br/><p>There was once she drank till she was high during those years of studying abroad. She sang the song \u2018Flesh\u2019 live and set the bar so high that they had to increase the security measures by three times, and yet they could not control the crowd...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

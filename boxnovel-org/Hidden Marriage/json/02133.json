No one had ever seen any child of the European King before.</p><br/><p>Yet the person before him now had been able to find out his true identity\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you\u2019re really well-informed, Mr. Lu.\u201d The man smiled.</p><br/><p>He was not the European King, but the third son of the European King.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour point?\u201d Lu Tingxiao was straightforward with him.</p><br/><p>The man said politely, \u201cMr. Lu, Mr. Yun, I invited the both of you today for some business matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Yun Shen asked indifferently.</p><br/><p>The man did not seem to mind Yun Shen\u2019s attitude. He wiped his hands with a napkin. \u201cI hope that I can\u2026 acquire the Lu Corporation and the Yi Lan Innovative Investment Group.\u201d</p><br/><p>An European lady then placed two thick documents on the table right before Lu Tingxiao and Yun Shen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the initial contract. Mr. Yun and Mr. Lu, you may take a look at it first. We can modify it if there\u2019s anything you\u2019re doubtful of or not satisfied with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen glanced at the two contracts. He snorted, \u201cHa, acquire our companies? That\u2019s really bold of you! Aren\u2019t you afraid of taking in too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not say anything. He quickly browsed through the contract, then he put it down and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t agree to your proposal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was not surprised by Lu Tingxiao and Yun Shen\u2019s refusal. \u201cMr. Lu, is it because the remuneration isn\u2019t good enough? It\u2019s alright. This is just an initial contract. We can continue discussing it. Mr. Lu, you can feel free to tell me what you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at the man in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli walked up from behind Lu Tingxiao, taking two contracts out as well. He smiled wryly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a look at the contracts we have, Mr. Rothschild?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man glanced at the contract\u2019s contents, his expression darkening.</p><br/><p>Were these two nobodies trying to acquire his company? What an insult!</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Lu, Mr. Yun, I came all the way to Asia only to acquire your companies. Your attitudes are making things more awkward than it needs to be!\u201d Baron Rothschild\u2019s gentleman-like attitude was nowhere to be seen now. His eyes looked cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? What do you want to do now?\u201d Yun Shen smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>The man looked at them ruthlessly. \u201cI just want the two of you to sign the contract. If not, I\u2019m afraid\u2026 you guys will never leave Heavenly Spring Resort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen laughed out loud. \u201cWould you believe if I say that you\u2019ll never be able to leave China?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man grinned questionably. \u201cWhat will happen to me in China?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m a little disappointed that your father isn\u2019t here\u2026\u201d Han Xiao, who had been busy eating in the corner, spoke up. He looked at Baron as he licked his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Xiao?!\u201d Baron was stunned to see who the person at the corner was. He never expected Han Xiao to be present and his surprise was apparent.</p><br/><p>The only people he had focused on there were Yun Shen and Lu Tingxiao. He had ignored all the others, but who knew Lu Tingxiao and Yun Shen would be able to ask him for help!?</p><br/><p>He knew that Han Xiao was helping Lu Tingxiao, but he never expected that Han Xiao would get involved like this.</p></div>\n</div>"}

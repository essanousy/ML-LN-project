The journalist was sweating with frayed nerves. This foreigner was too straightforward\u2026</p><br/><p>Although he meant those words genuinely, it was not very appropriate, especially in front of Su Yimo.</p><br/><p>Su Yimo smiled at him. \"To be able to impress Director Cook...this must be a marvelous artiste.\"</p><br/><p>Director Cook nodded confidently. \"Indeed, she is.\"</p><br/><p>Su Yimo\u2019s generosity placated any awkwardness. The crowd became even more interested in this new ambassador that they were going to announce.</p><br/><p>Was Cook exaggerating it for the brand or was the ambassador was really that amazing? The latter might be true since Noble was such a high-class brand; their ambassador could actually be as extraordinary as Cook claimed.</p><br/><p>The launch continued with the staff distributing their latest perfume sample to the guests.</p><br/><p>\"Noble Perfume originated 200 years ago and was inherited through the generations. With our very own unique formula, we adopted the ancient technique of perfume distillation and have selected the best ingredients under strict quality checks.

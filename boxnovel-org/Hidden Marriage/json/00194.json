In the dream, she threw herself into Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s arms and it quickly spiraled out of control\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah Ah Ah! How could she have such a dream?!</p><br/><p>In the bathroom Ning Xi ruffled her hair and splashed her face with cold water.</p><br/><p>She must pull herself together as today was her first day reporting to the new company!</p><br/><p>Out of time, she headed downstairs and saw the small bun and big bun waiting to cheer her on.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure raised his word pad to show one word: Fighting!</p><br/><p>Next to the small bun, a robot sprayed confetti and mechanically repeated the words: Fighting. Fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you!\u201d Ning Xi kissed the little bun and bowed towards the BIG BOSS while avoiding his eyes.</p><br/><p>After all, last night, she almost had her way with him in the dream\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally at Golden Entertainment.</p><br/><p>Standing in front of the magnificent building, facing a new start, new opportunities, and new challenges, Ning Xi felt hear chest heat up.</p><br/><p>When walking into the tall building, there was only one thought in her mind,</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack. With. No. Mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking around and seeing the resplendent way of decorating, it was clear that Lu Jingli had a good aesthetic sense.</p><br/><p>Following the directions she received from Lu Jingli, Ning Xi went up the elevator and arrived at the office at the end of the 17th floor.</p><br/><p>After knocking, she received the response \u201cCome in\u201d, from a female voice.</p><br/><p>Pushing open the door, Ning Xi felt her eyes were purified.</p><br/><p>Just outside, the brightness of the building was almost blinding, but inside this office, the main colors consisted of black, white and gray. It was decorated very simply.</p><br/><p>Sitting at the desk was a woman wearing black rimmed glasses and a professional champagne colored suit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello Ning Xi, from today on I am your agent, Lin Zhizhi. Have you perhaps heard of me? I usually don\u2019t work with new people, but with Leng Manyun retiring, the company needs someone to fill in her top position.\u201d Lin Zhizhi gave this simple explanation while her eyes looked over Ning Xi with a sense of pressure.</p><br/><p>Her first impression of this girl is that she and Leng Manyun are two completely different types. This girl has a type of striking, arrogant beauty.</p><br/><p>In the entertainment industry, this type of beauty can be considered first in it\u2019s class but also a double edged sword. A guileless beauty so dangerous it can cause a calamity. [ Based on a Chinese idiom/legend of Bao Si: \uff0c meaning a dangerously beautiful woman like an exquisite vase and can cause disasters. Synonymous to the the the Helen of Troy fiasco.]</p><br/><p>After listening to Lin Zhizhi\u2019s words, Ning Xi is very surprised. She is supposed to be the replacement for Leng Manyun? Isn\u2019t this expectation too high?</p><br/><p>However the greater the difficulty, the more excited Ning Xi becomes. Moreover, this has always been her goal!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you are the company\u2019s choice as her successor, but that means nothing to me. I will give you a trial period for six months. If you cannot meet my requisites then I am kicking you out. You can remain at the company, but I will never choose you again. Understood?\u201d Lin Zhizhi stated coldly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly acquiesced, \u201cYes madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time a knock sounded on the door, and a friendly, chubby looking little girl came in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the assistant I arranged for you\u201d, Lin Zhizhi said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood evening Ning Xi, I am Hu Tao but you can call me Taozi!\u201d the girl shyly introduced herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello\u201d Ning Xi greeted, giving the chubby, little assistant a good first impression of her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

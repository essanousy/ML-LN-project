At one glance, it looked especially high-tech and futuristic.</p><br/><p>The Lu residence was too large, Ning Xi had never seen every single part of it despite staying for so long. This was the first time she had visited this building.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some machinery installed in the base of this building so that it turns with the sun. The outer walls are made of solar panels, while the electricity inside comes from solar energy. The butler and maids are all robots.\u201d Lu Tingxiao fulfilled his role as a tour guide as he explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow cool!\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s face was lit up, showing child-like excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you like it, you can come over to play. I\u2019ll set up access rights for you later on. You didn\u2019t seem very interested in this kind of thing previously, so I never brought you over.\u201d Lu Tingxiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all! I love this kind of thing! When I was young, I always dreamed that I would be taken away by a spaceship some day! When I grew up, I even thought about dating a robot! Ah, it feels so romantic just thinking about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Perhaps it would be better not to give her access rights.</p><br/><p>The pair walked to the entrance only to see a robot lying on the ground. Its eyes suddenly lit up red, as if scanning Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>When the scan hit Lu Tingxiao, the robot struggled and made \u2018zzt\u2019 sounds, \u201cMaster\u2026 Master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This poor robot that kept calling for its \u2018master\u2019, looking like it wanted to report something but was unable to speak, was most likely the butler for this building.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao sighed and opened the panel on the back of the robot. It seemed like he pressed something, before the robot\u2019s eyes turned dark and it stopped moving.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi anxiously moved closer and touched it, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it moving anymore? It\u2019s not dead, is it? Oh, wait\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s not going to be scrapped, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019ll be fine after repairs later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi relaxed, \u201cOh, then that\u2019s good. It would be such a waste otherwise, this one\u2019s rather handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Then it should just be scrapped.</p><br/><p>After a scan of his face, he entered the main building. Ning Xi followed behind, looking around anxiously, \u201cWhere\u2019s Little Treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>The main hall was filled with robots who were patrolling about. Once they found Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao, they turned as one and faced them.</p><br/><p>Following that, they completely ignored Lu Tingxiao and started charging towards Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHHHH! What are they doing? Why are they all charging towards me!\u201d Ning Xi was frightened. No matter how good her martial arts were, surely she couldn\u2019t possibly beat a steel wall of robots?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s arms reached under her arms and easily lifted her from one side to another, successfully dodging the robotic claws of one of the robots. With a helpless tone, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s because you don\u2019t have access rights; they\u2019re treating you as an intruder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should we do now?\u201d In the time it took for her to say that, Ning Xi had already been swung about by Lu Tingxiao a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet closer to me.\u201d Lu Tingxiao ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! How much closer?\u201d Ning Xi was at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure is in the control room on the top floor. Right now, we have two choices. One, we beat them and charge in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are we supposed to beat so many robots! What\u2019s the second choice?\u201d Just looking at the material of the robots made her hands hurt. She didn\u2019t want to start beating them up!</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao lowered his gaze and looked at her, \u201cI carry you all the way up, because they won\u2019t attack me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked, then reached her arms towards him without hesitation, \u201cCarry me.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

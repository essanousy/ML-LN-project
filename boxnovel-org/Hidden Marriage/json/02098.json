Then, he walked slowly to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rubbed the little bun\u2019s lowered head. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby? Why did you hit Chi Shuai? Did Chi Shuai do something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Chi Shuai almost started crying from being wronged. \u201cAunty, I didn\u2019t! Aunty, I was even praising you! But Master suddenly hit me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d When Chi Shuai said that, Ning Xi found it even odder. \u201cYou even praised me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026 Fatty Chi! How did you praise her?\u201d From behind them came Lu Jingli\u2019s chuckle.</p><br/><p>Chi Shuai shot Lu Jingli an angry look. \u201cDon\u2019t call me Fatty Chi! I really praised Aunty. I said she was beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli looked at Little Treasure, then turned back at Chi Shuai again. \u201cOh? How did you say it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chi Shuai tried to recall. \u201cI said\u2026 I said to Master\u2026 Your stepmother is so beautiful! Right, I said it like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli sighed and shook his head. \u201cFatty Chi, you deserved to be hit! Who told you to jab the baby\u2019s heart?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chi Shuai was still confused. He only felt better when Yan Ruyi brought some snacks over to console him.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi seemed to have realized something, so she pulled Little Treasure to a corner. \u201cWhy did you hit Chi Shuai? Can you tell Mommy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure jumped into Ning Xi\u2019s embrace all of a sudden. \u201cMommy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026 not stepmother! You\u2019re Mommy!\u201d The little guy\u2019s clear eyes were filled with stubbornness.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s heart felt like it was being chewed on by a green fly as she felt dense pain. She patted the little guy\u2019s back softly and her voice was extraordinarily gentle. \u201cMmm, I\u2019m Mommy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Inside the study room.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli ran to tell Lu Tingxiao what had happened. \u201cAh, Fatty Chi said something wrong. He said \u2018stepmother\u2019 and jabbed his heart, so in the end, he ate Little Treasure\u2019s fist. Now, he\u2019s run to Ning Xi for caress and comfort.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the looks of it, Little Treasure still minds. I think the little guy hasn\u2019t been in too good of a mood recently, but what can we do? When Ning Xi\u2019s identity goes public, there will be even more talk like this. In the eyes of other people, Ning Xi <em>is </em> Little Treasure\u2019s stepmother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lu Tingxiao heard his brother\u2019s opinion, he looked up from the pile of documents and seemed a little dazed.</p><br/><p>Moments later, Lu Tingxiao spoke in a low and raspy voice, \u201cHow\u2019s the investigation of that matter coming along?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli looked solemn. \u201cBro, you predicted it correctly. The security footages from years ago were indeed tampered with, that\u2019s why I was puzzled how could there not be a single trace left behind. I investigated until I was about to go crazy. It turns out that person had sneakily edited a few minutes in the middle. I\u2019ve now found a group of experts to recover it the best they can. It shouldn\u2019t be too huge of a problem. It\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao hesitated for a moment, then he asked, \u201cThen\u2026 Bro, when the thing with Little Treasure is clarified, are you going to tell the truth to Sis-in-law? About Little Treasure\u2019s history, and that it\u2026 was you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A long while after, Lu Tingxiao nodded indistinctly. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Time flew past and very soon it was Lu Tingxiao\u2019s birthday.</p><br/><p>This time, the birthday banquet was organized at Imperial\u2019s top private venue, Heavenly Spring Resort. In fact, preparations had long begun since a few months ago.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Rainbow Feathers isn\u2019t even from David? It\u2019s Gong Shangze\u2019s work instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God! David has actually been lying from the start. He really stole Spirit\u2019s designs. Even all of his famed works were Gong Shangze\u2019s design! How did this happen!? My world is turned upside down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the shocked comments, there were some who still did not give up. \u201cEven if it\u2019s proven that Rainbow Feathers wasn\u2019t made by David himself, that can\u2019t prove that the other designs weren\u2019t completed by him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such opinions immediately received backlash from many.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome people keep calling others a fool. I think they\u2019re the real fools! It\u2019s already gone to this extent and they\u2019re still trying to justify David\u2019s actions. If Ranbow Feathers design wasn\u2019t done by Gong Shangze, then would Gong Shangze be able to create these clothes from thin air?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClearly, the clothes weren\u2019t done by him. He could still pretend to be virtuous and claim fame in the eyes of the world, even boasting about how good his skills were. When he saw that the clothes had Gong Shangze\u2019s name on them, he still didn\u2019t repent. He continued to unchangingly frame someone else by saying they tampered with the clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter being exposed on the spot that the double-sided three-fold embroidery can\u2019t be tampered with, he actually shamelessly came up with the hilarious reason that he embroidered Gong Shangze\u2019s name onto the clothes to motivate himself! Only when he was slapped on the face by Qu Guanyang on the spot, he finally shut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs the chief designer of a brand and the so-called leading figure in the international Oriental style, his words and actions are so inconsistent. From the start till the end, he\u2019s been lying. Can such a person\u2019s words still be trusted? Whether or not his past works were his original creation is really worth being suspicious about! Whatever it is, this time, I stand on Gong Shangze\u2019s side!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, many people asked, \u201cBut why would Gong Shangze\u2019s designs be stolen by David? Not only were the design drafts trademarked by David, even the finished clothes fell into David\u2019s hands. This is weird!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was not just the audience watching the live stream who asked this. Even wondered all the guests and industry figures present had the same question on their minds.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone\u2019s gazes, including Akas\u2019s and Qu Guanyang\u2019s, fell onto Gong Shangze.</p><br/><p>Facing the looks from all over the world, Gong Shangze was emotional. He had waited and endured it for so long. Finally, people were willing to hear him tell this secret. He finally had the chance to speak.</p><br/><p>The young man took a deep breath and then started slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, David and I started up a fashion studio together. We called it Neon. Because I\u2019m not good at socializing and networking, I was in charge of designs while David was in charge of the studio operations.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur studio began from a place where no one was interested until later on when more and more people knew about it. Later on, our studio opened up abroad and we started to look for a wider market. Slowly, many investors started to want to collaborate with us.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always seen David as the most trustworthy partner. I\u2019ve never asked anything about the studio\u2019s matters. I only focused on creating. All of the designs were passed to him for safekeeping.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never would\u2019ve thought that he had been secretly trademarking all of my designs with his name. When I had transferred all of my designs, he stole everything from the studio, signed a contract with an investor alone, and completely erased any trace of me. He erased Neon\u2019s existence and established History!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

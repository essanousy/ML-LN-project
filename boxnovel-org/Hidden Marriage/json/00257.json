Hope to have it fixeed by tonight \ud83d\ude42</p><br/><p>Translator: Akari, Blaze</p><br/><p>Editor: cfadmode</p><br/><p>\u201cCut\u2013\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>One perfect shot!!!</p><br/><p>The audience burst into thunderous applause, especially the journalists and friends, they spared no effort to clap.</p><br/><p>That was a very emotional action scene, and it could also be said to be extremely complex. No one thought that they could do it in one perfect shot, so they were quite surprised and delighted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god! Jiang Muye was drop-dead handsome! I thought that acting as a very weak doctor would definitely destroy his image! But the result was really surprising!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes ah, yes ah! Jiang Muye has definitely subverted his previous image! It feels like his acting has progressed alot! I totally don\u2019t care who the main lead is now, I just want to see my family Doctor Sun\u2019s scenes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEspecially that last sentence \u2018I am your man\u2019, it was really acted well, right? It was full of deep feeling!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too! I always felt that there was something missing when Jiang Muye said these kind of sensational lines to the female lead. I finally know what was missing now. It was feelings ah! This time, Jiang Muye acted with feelings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At the side, Director Guo was so excited that he felt like crying. He and assistant director was hugging each other in excitement.</p><br/><p>The acting really touched their hearts!</p><br/><p>They never thought that it would be so smooth! The reactions of the reporters were really good too!</p><br/><p>It was simply an auspicious start ah!</p><br/><p>At the resting area.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye proudly said, \u201cHow was it? I already said there would be no problem! You people only know how to worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa-\u201d Ning Xi had a disdained look. \u201cThat is because the person that you are acting with is big sister, me. If it was other people, with your dog shit state today, you would have to redo the scene at least twenty times, believe it or not!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop thinking so highly of yourself! If it was other people\u2026\u2026at most it would be nineteen times!\u201d Jiang Muye had a careless and casual tone.</p><br/><p>Of course it was because the person that he was acting with was Ning Xi, thats why he was able to be at ease to act it all out! He\u2019s not stupid ah!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s greatest ability was not just \u2018pressure acting\u2019, but she was also able to make others smoothly act out their roles without being stopped and cut, at the first shot.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, Ning Xiao Xi, this skill of yours is really abnormal\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the abnormal one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The two of them were continued to deride each other, until Lei Ming and Lin Zhizhi walked in.</p><br/><p>Lei Ming was also full of excitement, he happily poured drink for Jiang Muye and gave him food. \u201cNot bad, not bad, Muye. Your performance was very good today! It was completely beyond my expectations! You must continue to maintain it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Jiang Muye getting praised, Ning Xi was not happy. She looked at Lin Zhizhi, like a little kid asking for candy, \u201cSister Zhizhi, what about me, what about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Zhizhi was not as excited as Lei Ming, but she still had a satisfied expression, \u201cIt was great, but you cannot be complacent, your most important scene is the next one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d getting the three words \u2018it was great\u2019, Ning Xi was already very satisfied and delighted.</p><br/><p>At the side, Jiang Muye took a glance at Lin Zhizhi, then turned his head away, and mumbled, \u201cDidn\u2019t expect it ah, mother tiger has become gentler after not seeing for years! You did not even treat me that gentle once before!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Zhizhi finally gave him a glance, then expressionlessly said, \u201cPut yourself in my shoes, if you were me back then, would you be able to be gentle to yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye was choked by her words.</p><br/><p>Shit! Was he a scumbag back then?</p><br/><p>Seems like\u2026\u2026he was indeed quite a scumbag\u2026\u2026and not only then, but he is currently still a scumbagz\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking it over, if he was Lin Zhizhi, he would want to beat himself up too\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same moment, the journalists who were outside were all very anxious to interview Ning Xi and Jiang Muye, but they were all stopped by the director. Only after the direction had expressed that there will be sufficient time after the shoot for an interview, then everyone settled down.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

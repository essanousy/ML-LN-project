She paced about and said, \u201cDid they make a mistake somewhere? Wasn\u2019t Jiang Muye filming overseas? Even if he came back, why would he take such a small role as the second male lead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo muttered lowly, \u201cI heard that Jiang Muye refuses to take any role other than the male lead. Moreover, the main sponsor for this film is Starlight Entertainment, so why would he come here as a Golden Age artiste?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she had been celebrating moments ago that she wouldn\u2019t get taken advantage of, Jia Qingqing was now close to going crazy, \u201cDamn it! How did it turn out like this! How is Ning Xi\u2019s luck so good! Jiang Muye should have been mine, mine! It\u2019s all because she took my role so shamelessly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people watching around her sympathised after seeing her expression, and weren\u2019t at all surprised by her frenzy.</p><br/><p>It was because everyone in the entertainment circle knew that Jia Qingqing loved Jiang Muye, and had even publicly confessed to him through her Weibo previously. Although Jiang Muye had completely ignored her, she would still frequently post about news related to Jiang Muye on her Weibo like an ardent fan.</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng used tremendous strength and finally got that group of crazy ladies settled down. He couldn\u2019t resist teasing, \u201cMuye, look at how you\u2019ve already gotten the ladies of our crew wrapped around your finger! Handsome guys really are treated better!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye played along and joked, \u201cDirector, haven\u2019t you heard? All of them just want to bed me, so you have to protect me, okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026 No worries, your partner is the war goddess Meng Changge, she\u2019ll protect you! Oh yes, where\u2019s Ning Xi? She kept asking who her second male lead would be, how come she\u2019s disappeared now?\u201d Guo Qisheng looked all over for her.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye had a faint trace of a smile on his lips, \u201cMaybe she was scared away by me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might be possible, almost all the girls in this country are your fans. Maybe Ning Xi is one too, and she\u2019s suffered a shock from seeing her idol!\u201d Guo Qisheng smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>As the two were talking, Ning Xi was walking over.</p><br/><p>In a short amount of time, the expression on Ning Xi\u2019s face had already become flawless, she smiled as she reached her hand out to the person she was facing, \u201cSenior Jiang, nice to meet you. I\u2019m Ning Xi. I\u2019m honoured to be working with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Ning Xi was the same age as Jiang Muye, since Jiang Muye had entered the industry earlier, he was her senior and she had to be respectful towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye\u2019s lips curled up. He reached out to shake her hand lightly, but in the next second, he almost threw her hand away without caring about his image.</p><br/><p>This damned girl, she had almost crushed the bones in his hand.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye struggled to hold onto his cool expression, and acted as if a sudden realisation had hit him, \u201cAh, Ning Xi, so it\u2019s you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Do you know each other?\u201d Guo Qisheng was surprised upon hearing so. It wasn\u2019t just the director, but the rest of the cast and crew had focused their gazes on Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye smiled with hidden meaning, \u201cOf course we know each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that ambiguous tone and seeing the strange looks that everyone directed at her, Ning Xi was so angry that her hand started shaking. She was almost unable to hold back the raging urge to pummel him!</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ning Xi\u2019s face was almost turning white from anger, Jiang Muye finally spoke up slowly, \u201cWe worked together on the set of \u300aBlue Bird\u300bpreviously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? How come I\u2019ve never heard Ning Xi mention that before?\u201d Guo Qisheng was taken aback.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt like she had just escaped death, her back was covered in sweat. She replied meekly, \u201cDirector Guo, I was just the stunt double for the female lead then, it\u2019s amazing that Senior Jiang remembers me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng was amused upon hearing so, \u201cOh my, I didn\u2019t think that the two of you would have fate like this. That\u2019s great, since you\u2019ve worked together before and you know each other, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to warm up. Let\u2019s start with a little more exciting and go with a confrontation scene, shall we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cUh\u2026\u201d A confrontation scene? More exciting? Director, please don\u2019t do this! They\u2019re not familiar!</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye smiled happily, \u201cSure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt like reaching out and plucking out those evil little canines.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

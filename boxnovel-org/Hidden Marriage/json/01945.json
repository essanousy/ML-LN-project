It had been repeatedly screened many times and brought nostalgia to all film lovers and was a true classic. Once the news of it being remade was released, it received a huge amount of attention.</p><br/><p>The arrangement of this film\u2019s plot was quite in line with Hollywood\u2019s usual style.</p><br/><p>The female lead, Anna, was raised by an assassin organization since young. At last, she was arranged to go on a mission to assassinate a leader of an influential family with a celebrated reputation. It was a story of conspiracy and love, interweaving with the male lead who was full of clever strategies.</p><br/><p>No matter what role Han Zixuan got, even if it was just unremarkable cannon fodder, as long as she has entered the crew of \u201cAssassin\u201d and got herself some screentime in the movie, her status and position in the future would definitely rise together with the movie.</p><br/><p>The most annoying thing was that in Hollywood, they would very rarely pick two actors from China.</p><br/><p>This meant that if Han Zixuan successfully partook in the filming of \u201cAssassin\u201d, then the probability of Ning Xi joining the \u201cAssassin\u201d crew would be reduced by more than half!</p><br/><p>At Glory World Entertainment.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao looked furiously at all of the headlines. \u201cShow, my ass! My queen has already advanced into Hollywood a year ago!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing shot a glance at him. \u201cSadly, it hasn\u2019t been released up till now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao grumbled unhappily, \u201cWell, we can\u2019t just watch those disgusting people, can we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that the audition for the Chinese role in \u2018Assassin\u2019 will only officially begin in a week. Han Zixuan was decided internally. I heard that they didn\u2019t even mind not getting paid. Now, to suppress Ning Xi, they\u2019ve already released this news before the audition!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cIf Ning Xi goes for the audition, she can definitely defeat her!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liang Feixing heard Xu Tao, he did not look optimistic. \u201cSince it was already internally decided, and in fact, Starlight\u2019s already announced it with such great fanfare, then it definitely must be already in the bag. This role isn\u2019t easy to compete for. The point is\u2026 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need. It\u2019s probably just a few seconds screen time and only one line!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Just to be cool, any professional would know that they\u2019re being devalued in this role. They\u2019re obviously losing money just to show off! I think Ning Xi probably wouldn\u2019t agree either. Ning Xi\u2019s scenes in \u2018Thunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u2019 added up to more than ten minutes!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the office door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi walked in. \u201cThere\u2019s no harm. I can go for the audition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao instantly frowned. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already reached this far. Obviously, I can\u2019t give up halfway. Besides, this movie is \u2018Assassin\u2019. Even if it\u2019s a few seconds\u2019 screen time, it\u2019s worth it too. I myself am actually a loyal fan of this movie. This time, I can consider it as fulfilling a dream of mine!\u201d Ning Xi said.</p><br/><p>As Xu Tao watched his goddess being so understanding, he was so moved that tears streamed down his cheeks.</p><br/><p>( )</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing thought about it. They were so close to defeating Han Zixuan already. Indeed, they could only steal this role now. Otherwise, all that they had done before would go to waste, and the effects would be hugely discounted too.</p><br/><p>Visiting monks gave better sermons. The Chinese people still instinctively thought highly of Hollywood.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the looks of it, that\u2019s the only thing we can do. I\u2019ll go gather more information on the filming crew!\u201d Liang Feixing said.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

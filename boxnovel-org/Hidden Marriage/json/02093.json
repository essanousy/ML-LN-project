Every one of them eventually made excuses and left.</p><br/><p>The elder was physically and emotionally exhausted. He did not want to care about his eldest son\u2019s grievances anymore. With the help of the servant, he left with a faltering figure.</p><br/><p>Back then, he had already done his best to advise them and he had said all he could. They made all the choices themselves. Now, it would be up to them how to resolve this as well. He already did not have the strength to care anymore.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, only Ning Yaohua, Zhuang Lingyu, Zheng Minjun, Su Hongguang, Su Yan, and Ning Xueluo were left.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Zheng Minjun could not stand the fact that the son she was so proud of had been cuckolded, while her dearest grandchild that she had been anticipating was actually illegitimate. After those people left, she did not care about anything anymore. She pointed at Ning Xueluo and started to curse incoherently, \u201cWe Sus were really blind to let Su Yan marry such a fake, rotten good!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows which man she\u2019s messed around with outside? And when she got pregnant, she still dared to say that it\u2019s our Su Yan\u2019s! Divorce her! Get lost from our Su family immediately! Also, don\u2019t think about taking a single thing from us with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo could not hold back her guffaw. \u201cHaha\u2026 Did you really think this Ning Xi was all that pure? She was impregnated at 18, and she even said that it was Su Yan\u2019s. I\u2019m much better than she is!\u201d</p><br/><p>If it were not for the way Zheng Minjun did not give up on urging Su Yan to remarry after finding out about Ning Xi\u2019s relationship with the Zhuang family at Madam Li\u2019s gathering, she would not have slept with that fat and disgusting tycoon to pull in investments and stabilize her position.</p><br/><p>If it were not for Su Yan\u2019s soul being seduced away by that witch and not wanting to have a child with her at all, she would not have risked keeping the illegitimate child in her!</p><br/><p>All of it was Ning Xi, that witch\u2019s fault! It was the Su family\u2019s fault!</p><br/><p>When she heard Ning Xueluo\u2019s words, Zheng Minjun was stunned. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said\u2026 Back then, when Ning Xi that slut was still dating Su Yan, she had already been messing around outside. She even fooled about with two gigolos. When she got pregnant, she said it was Su Yan\u2019s. If it were not for that car accident, she would\u2019ve probably given birth to the bastard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she looked mockingly towards Ning Yaohua and Zhuang Lingyu like she was delighted at her revenge. \u201cHahaha\u2026 Don\u2019t believe me? If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask Director Ning or Madam Ning! Ask them whether their real daughter is even more lowly, more wanton than I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Yaohua and Zhuang Lingyu saw that Ning Xueluo had actually blurted out the Ning family\u2019s most shameful scandal in front of the Su family, their faces instantly turned pale.</p><br/><p>Before this, they had erased all traces of this incident, yet they still could not erase its existence.</p><br/><p>This incident was like a nightmare to them\u2026</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, in the corner of the ward, suddenly came a man\u2019s lowered and trembling voice. \u201cEnough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard this voice, the reckless smile on Ning Xueluo\u2019s face suddenly stiffened in an instance.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot Xiao Xi\u2026 That incident back then wasn\u2019t Xiao Xi\u2019s fault at all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan clenched his fists as he looked embarassed. With clear difficulty, he admitted, \u201cXiao Xi didn\u2019t betray me from the start to the end. She didn\u2019t mess around with other men\u2026 She didn\u2019t\u2026 Someone forced himself on her\u2026 She was set up by someone else\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

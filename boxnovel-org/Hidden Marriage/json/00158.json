On one hand, it was to butter up Lu Tingxiao. On the other hand, she really did need his help.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao remained silent for three seconds before finally speaking the golden word: \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You really have a solution?\u201d Ning Xi was so excited she almost jumped into the air, \u201cThen how long do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao was about to say one hour, but he suddenly changed his mind, \u201cOne night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fast?! That\u2019s great!\u201d Ning Xi was delighted over the great news and hurriedly pulled out a laptop from her bag, \u201cThis is the laptop I took from Zhang Qiang. Do you need anything else? I\u2019ll help you prepare them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Lu Tingxiao stood up and headed upstairs while speaking.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi eagerly followed closely after him.</p><br/><p>Upon reaching the study, the perceptive Ning Xi ran to help Lu Tingxiao pull out his chair, then placed the laptop on top of the desk before Lu Tingxiao. She then jogged off to pour a glass of water for him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao shot a casual glance at her before sitting down in the chair.</p><br/><p>He then took out his own laptop and brought out a cable to connect the two laptops. After skimming over the evidence she had mentioned, he opened a file and entered a string of complicated-looking code into a window on his laptop screen.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi leaned on the desk and moved closer to look out of curiosity, but of course, it looked like gibberish to her. She held a completely dazed expression. Although she couldn\u2019t understand any of it, whatever he was doing still seemed pretty awesome.</p><br/><p>While Lu Tingxiao was typing, he heard light breathing near his ear, so he abruptly stopped moving his fingers and started frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Is anything wrong?\u201d Ning Xi immediately asked tensely.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s tone was slightly cool: \u201cMove further away from me.\u201d She was leaning too close, it was affecting his concentration.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Ning Xi shrivelled up like an eggplant in winter and lowered her head. In a sad and dismal manner, she shifted to the furthest corner of the room and sat on the sofa there.</p><br/><p>Seeing the girl\u2019s pitiful appearance, Lu Tingxiao almost spoke up to comfort her, but he held back in the end.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hugged a cushion in her arms and quietly watched Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face from the side profile as he was working seriously. She inwardly savoured the sight; it was true that men were the most handsome when they were working earnestly!</p><br/><p>Momentarily, only the quiet sound of fingers tapping on the keyboard could be heard in the study.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sat there and struggled with her thoughts for a long while before she finally couldn\u2019t resist and spoke up, \u201cLu Tingxiao\u2026 Can I ask you a question?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you ask me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s fingers clenched into fists, \u201cAsk about that gun! You\u2019re not going to ask why I have a gun? Don\u2019t you think that I\u2019m not like what you expected at all, that I\u2019m\u2026 very scary?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t continue questioning her, but Ning Xi felt extremely sorry in her heart. He had always treated her like a friend and helped her without holding back. However, she kept hiding and concealing every little thing about herself.</p><br/><p>Thus, even though Lu Tingxiao hadn\u2019t continued questioning her, Ning Xi took the initiative to speak up, \u201cYou know how the public order in America isn\u2019t very good, and how having a gun is legal there? I learned how to use a gun when I was there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it\u2019s not legal to have guns back here in China. This gun was smuggled in through illegal channels. I don\u2019t know how it was done exactly, it was given to me by a friend, the one who taught me how to shoot. It\u2019s for the sake of self-defense only when I absolutely need it. Since I\u2019ve come back to China, I\u2019ve only used it just this once!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stopped all movement: \u201cWhat kind of person is that friend of yours?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

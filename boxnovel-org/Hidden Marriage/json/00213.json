I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d This kiss restored Little Treasure and he nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave first!\u201d Ning XI said heading out</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201c\u201dI\u2019m coming along!\u201d</p><br/><p>They both said it at the same time</p><br/><p>Ning Xi \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dangerous person to be with.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao said with a frown</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye grunted confidently, \u201cI was curious to see who is more dangerous in the end\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi just felt her headache growing looking at Lu Ting Xiao and Jiang Muye. Finally her eyes landed upon Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli blinked back innocently, wondering what his sister-in-law wanted.</p><br/><p>Finally, Ning Xi began \u201cI don\u2019t know what the situation in there is. It\u2019s definitely less trouble if the two of you don\u2019t accompany me. Lu Ting Xiao, you\u2026stay with Little Treasure!\u201d Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for you Jiang Muye, youre giving me a headache! Don\u2019t you know your face can stir up a lot of trouble? Showing up to the hospital at night! You want to create a troublesome news story? \u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Makino looked at her angrily. Why was she so hard on him, but so gentle with Lu Ting Xiao!</p><br/><p>\u201cLets go, lets go. Ning Xi, I\u2019ll go with you!\u201d Lu Jingli said excitedly, about to leap into the streets. He was quite happy. This was really when two dogs fight, the third gets the bone kind of situation.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Hospital emergency room.</p><br/><p>The inside of the hospital was a crowded mess. It took a long time before Ning Xi finally found the doctor that called her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Ning Xi. Where did you say my friend is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Ning Xi? He just finished surgeru and is on the 12th floor in ward 307. If you could go recognize his body, as he doesn\u2019t have any proof of identity on him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you!</p><br/><p>So Ning Xi and Lu Jingli rushed upstairs. The elevators were crowded so they had to take the full 12 flights of stairs. The pain!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi is tired, but Lu Jingli is still very excited like a child. She finally understood why Lu Jingli can be so successful in the entertainment business. His lust for gossip is really second to none!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

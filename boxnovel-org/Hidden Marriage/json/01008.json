What else could he do?</p><br/><p>Racing? Yes! He raced pretty well too!</p><br/><p>But this bastard seems like he's pretty versatile. It's too risky\u2026</p><br/><p>Playing cards, horse riding, gambling...Zhuang Rongguang thought of all the things he did, but none of them seemed to be something he could best Ning Xi in!</p><br/><p>In the end, Zhuang Rongguang looked unwell because he realized that he was pretty useless\u2026</p><br/><p>As he was running out of ideas, he suddenly thought of something. \"Right! Shooting! Compete with me at shooting!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's expression was a little awkward when she heard Zhuang Rongguang's challenge. </p><br/><p>\"Shooting...why shooting?\"</p><br/><p>Young man, why do you try so hard to destroy yourself\u2026?</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer stared at Zhuang Rongguang in surprise. \"My brother's shooting skills are pretty good\u2026\"</p><br/><p>But did he not hate guns very much? Today, he\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Pretty good!? I'm freaking talented, alright?\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang had finally found something that he could totally dominate others in, so he was really pumped up. \"You said it yourself, I can pick anything. You lose if you don't agree to this!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled. \"I'll do anything for Keer.\"</p><br/><p>\"I hope you can still be smiling like this later on!\" Zhuang Rongguang clenched his teeth and glared at Ning Xi. \"Just to clarify, we're competing on a professional shooting range with real guns. It's not some child's play! We're going to the Northern shooting range!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied, \"Okay!\"</p><br/><p>Known as the best shooting range in the whole of China, Zhuang Liaoyuan had invited her over before but she had been busy, so it was a good opportunity for her to visit this time.</p><br/><p>\"I'll go too!\" Zhuang Keer was afraid that something bad might happen. Specifically, she was afraid that her brother would do something mean to Ning Xi, so she had to watch closely.</p><br/><p>\"You're still sick and you need to rest more,\" Ning Xi reminded.</p><br/><p>\"It's alright, I feel much better after a night of good sleep, but it'll do me good to walk around too!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay then, put on some more clothes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang was irked by their lovey-dovey act right in front of him. He promised himself that he would humiliate that bastard so badly that he would never show up again!</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, the three of them reached the Northern shooting range. Zhuang Rongguang made a call and a young man in a camouflage uniform came out to bring them in.</p><br/><p>After they settled down, the young man left.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhuang's son had actually come to the shooting range on his own accord?! He had been so against it before even though the Chief had pointed a gun to his head. And it was not just Zhuang Rongguang. Even the Chief's daughter, Zhuang Keer, was here too with a young, handsome man...what a weird combo\u2026</p><br/><p>As a loyal servant, he quickly made a call and reported this strange incident to the Chief.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

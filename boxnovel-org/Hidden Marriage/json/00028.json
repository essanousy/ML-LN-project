Then it\u2019s quite the honour!\u201d Ning Xi was very happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to eat in the afternoon?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>He was seemingly prepared to feed her in addition to staying here\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was about to speak up when her phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>It was from Chang Li.</p><br/><p>Did she arrange another bit role for her?</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Chang-jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi,?Land Under Heaven?is holding an opening ceremony at the Grand Pearl Hotel at 12pm, don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? 12pm? 12pm today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChang-jie, why didn\u2019t you inform me earlier? It\u2019s already almost 11am!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I didn\u2019t inform you earlier, aren\u2019t I telling you an hour in advance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn hour, that isn\u2019t even enough for me to travel there, furthermore I have to dress and do my makeup\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are your problems, don\u2019t annoy me, I\u2019m very busy now, I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having finished her words, she hung up immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cChang! **** you!\u201d Ning Xi threw her phone.</p><br/><p>After saying so, Ning Xi froze.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was stunned.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was also stunned.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wiped her face, hating that she couldn\u2019t dig a hole to bury herself in.</p><br/><p>She had gotten too agitated and had forgotten that she was still in the Lu residence, and that she even had a little kid next to her\u2026</p><br/><p>She had not intended to act like a demure lady in front of Lu Tingxiao anyway, but it would be bad if she was a bad influence on Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>She coughed twice, \u201cEr, Little Treasure, just take it that you never heard that just now! You absolutely cannot learn from auntie\u2019s example and scold people, because what auntie was scolding just now was not a person!\u201d Ning Xi explained solemnly.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure blinked and nodded like he did not fully understand.</p><br/><p>A trace of humour flashed across Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes as he asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gritted her teeth, \u201cThe opening ceremony for?Land Under Heaven?starts today at 12pm. It\u2019s almost 11am but my manager only called to inform me just now. It takes at least 50 minutes to reach Grand Pearl Hotel from here, don\u2019t tell me I need to appear on camera bare-faced?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? Your bare face is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned for a moment, she had not expected that Lu Tingxiao would actually be this smooth. She scratched her head, coughing once in embarrassment, \u201cThanks for the compliment, Mr Lu\u2026 but it\u2019s considered rude if I don\u2019t put on basic makeup at the very least at these kinds of events. Most importantly, I don\u2019t have any appropriate clothes at the moment and there\u2019ll be so many media outlets there. Ahhhhh! This is so frustrating\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for a moment.\u201d Lu Tingxiao raised his hand and indicated for her to stay calm, then took his phone to the courtyard to make a call.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later, someone arrived, panting out of breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO Lu, I\u2019ve brought all the stuff you wanted, are we starting right now?\u201d The newcomer was wearing jeans with holes and a grey cotton jacket, and had a striking dark blue earring on his left ear.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was surprised to find that he was actually a familiar face.</p><br/><p>Of course, familiar face meaning that Ning Xi recognised him, but he did not recognise Ning Xi at all.</p><br/><p>He was a makeup artist known as The Godly Hand under Golden Age Entertainment and the personal makeup artist of the famous actress, Su Yimo, Arthur.</p><br/><p>He was someone famous that a small fry like her could only gaze at from afar!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s face was full of suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t recognise him?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I recognise the famous Arthur! But what did you call him over for\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo style you, naturally.\u201d Lu Tingxiao said as if it was a matter of course.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s head was full of black lines momentarily, she moved closer to Lu Tingxiao\u2019s ear and said softly, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re actually making someone from Golden Age Entertainment style me? Are you sure?! Don\u2019t you know that I\u2019m under Starlight Entertainment? Golden Age and Starlight are dead rivals, okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Lu Tingxiao replied like the domineering CEO he was.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

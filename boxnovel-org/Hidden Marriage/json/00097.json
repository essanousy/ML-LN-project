They ate and chatted idly on and off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, let\u2019s welcome our great star back home! Second Uncle will give you a toast!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I didn\u2019t get the chance to ask you yet. How did you meet Xiao Xixi?\u201d Lu Jingli asked seemingly thoughtlessly, trying to suss out information on behalf of his brother.</p><br/><p>Hearing this question, Jiang Muye\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look too good. It seemed like he didn\u2019t really want to discuss this topic. He replied vaguely: \u201cWe met in university overseas, and we\u2019re in the same batch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli narrowed his eyes and glanced at him sideways, saying with some hidden meaning, \u201cI think it\u2019s not that simple, right? Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s an ex that you chased and tossed aside after you got her? The women by your side, excluding your mum and your fans, are your ex-girlfriends!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi snorted in laughter and gave Lu Jingli a thumbs-up: \u201cSecond Young Master, you\u2019re too smart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it looks like I guessed right!\u201d Lu Jingli\u2019s expression was full of pride. There really was nothing he couldn\u2019t guess in this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only half right!\u201d Jiang Muye retorted, his face turning dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What do you mean by half right?\u201d Lu Jingli didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my ex-girlfriend alright, but she was the one who chased me and dumped me!\u201d Jiang Muye glared at Ning Xi sitting opposite with the expression of an abandoned wife as he spoke.</p><br/><p>An imperceptible glint flashed across Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes while he was helping Ning Xi and Little Treasure cut their steaks.</p><br/><p>Even Lu Jingli was startled, this was the first time he had guessed wrongly. He slammed the table with both hands and spoke while trying to hold back his excitement: \u201cReally? Are you kidding me? This doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how Ning Xi had been like overseas, she couldn\u2019t match up to the absurdity of this kid, so he had always thought that it was Jiang Muye who had initiated the breakup between the two. He hadn\u2019t expected\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye stabbed a rib on his plate angrily, \u201cAsk her if you don\u2019t believe me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did they get onto this topic suddenly? Ning Xi\u2019s face was full of helplessness, \u201cThat was a complete accident!\u201d</p><br/><p>The burning desire for gossip in Lu Jingli had already been lit up, and he was no longer just asking for his brother. He asked curiously, \u201cThen what happened? Tell me quick! Quick quick quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was speechless.</p><br/><p>As someone from the older generation, is it really good for you to be so interested in the younger generation\u2019s gossip?</p><br/><p>Seeing that Jiang Muye\u2019s expression had turned ugly, and not wanting to make him look bad in front of his seniors, Ning Xi answered, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing special. So many girls liked him back then in school. I was just one of them. In the end, we broke up because I found that he wasn\u2019t what I imagined and my fantasy collapsed!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like there was nothing wrong with Ning Xi\u2019s words, but Lu Jingli knew that things weren\u2019t as simple as that. Otherwise, Jiang Muye\u2019s expression wouldn\u2019t look like that.</p><br/><p>Tsk, he was going to see if he could drag something out of the kid after giving him some wine later.</p><br/><p>Since Little Treasure was around, Ning Xi didn\u2019t drink tonight. After she finished eating, she sat by the table and was a little bored. Thus, she asked: \u201cMr Lu, can I go bring Little Treasure over there to play some games?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the tone he used with Ning Xi seemed rather normal, it gave off a warm feeling that wasn\u2019t there with other people.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s face was full of resentment. That was his video game machine, the setup that he had brought back specially. She actually asked permission from another man, and was going to play with another man!</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t accept it even if that man was just five years old!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

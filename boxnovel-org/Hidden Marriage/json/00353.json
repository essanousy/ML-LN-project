Why haven\u2019t we seen anything yet?\"</p><br/><p>Upon this reminder, the crowd got excited and the hall was filled with chatter.</p><br/><p>\"Right, the love letter even mentioned that he would prepare something that was most honorable, most tempting, and make one wouldn\u2019t able to resist it!\"</p><br/><p>\"He's got all of us curious, how exciting!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"What surprise? Is there going to be another surprise?\" some confused media reporters asked.</p><br/><p>\"Well, it\u2019s our other lead actress, Ning Xi. Yesterday, she received a passionate love letter!\" explained Fang Ya, taking out a pink letter.</p><br/><p>When she saw the letter, Xiao Tao turned pale and exclaimed, \"How in the world...? I\u2019ve already thrown the letter away! How did she get it?!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi frowned.</p><br/><p>\"Sis Xi, it was my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have just thrown it away, I should have destroyed it! How...what should I do now\u2026\" Xiao Tao anxiously stammered.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi patted her back and comforted her, \"It\u2019s okay, it was just a love letter. Fang Ya publicly violated my privacy and the media won't take too kindly to that. We can fight back later on!\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Tao was about to cry, \"But you\u2019ve already lost face...there are so many people today...it\u2019s all my fault\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Fang Ya recited the contents of the letter all over again to the public, and even passed the love letter around. Almost everyone read through it, and there was even a reporter taking pictures of it while laughing hard\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Yan raised his brows, \"Does Xiao Xi\u2019s admirer have some sort of mental problem? Will she be okay?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo hid her evil grin, \"From the tone of the letter, it\u2019s a little odd, most probably from a poor pleb that found mental support by worshipping celebrities. There are actually a lot of people like that, it's just Ning Xi's luck that that guy chose her\u2026\"</p><br/><p>When Fang Ya finished reading, she walked up to Ning Xi, \"How was it, Ning Xi? Why don\u2019t you say anything? Where\u2019s your surprise? Everyone\u2019s waiting!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, yeah! Urge him for the surprise! We\u2019re really looking forward to it!\"</p><br/><p>\"Speaking of which, that pleb wouldn\u2019t really send a truck of cornbread, would he?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve never really eaten cornbread before! Looks like I'll get to try something new tonight\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A lot of people were taking pictures, and some even took live videos. Everyone waited to watch what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>In the corner, Xiao Tao was really embarrassed and blamed herself, crying profusely. Ning Xi could not stand girls crying, so she tried really hard to comfort her. Then, there happened to be an annoying reporter who saw Xiao Tao and rudely pointed his camera in front of Xiao Tao\u2019s face\u2026</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi was going to tell the reporter off, \"Bam!\", the door to the banquet hall opened from outside.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over to see the owner of the hotel himself standing at the doorstep, followed by a tall and heavy-built male Caucasian...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was just a regular father.</p><br/><p>No wonder the first time they met, he was already so friendly to her. It turned out that he had seen his daughter in her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though Miss Caroline has passed away, she left the most beautiful scene for everyone. She didn\u2019t only work hard for you. It was also for her dreams. I believe that she has never blamed you!\u201d Ning Xi said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d Jace\u2019s eyes suddenly glistened.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded. \u201cIf it were me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Jace let out a long sigh as if he could finally put his burden down.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at Ning Xi and said, \u201cI\u2019m returning to Europe tomorrow. Xiao Xi, if you ever come to Europe, you have to contact me. Let me do the honor of being your host.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI definitely will!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Jace\u2019s departure, the European King\u2019s people all retreated. Lu Tingxiao\u2019s and Yun Shen\u2019s people all followed suit and went back too.</p><br/><p>The huge Heavenly Spring Resort returned to its usual tranquility. The scenery was beautiful and it was a wonderful spring day. It was as if all the things earlier had not just happened.</p><br/><p>As for the huge battle this time, the only person who had died was unexpectedly\u2026 Qiao Yi\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at Qiao Yi, who lay on the ground and had unfortunately died in Han Xiao\u2019s hands. She felt a mix of emotions.</p><br/><p>Tang Ye walked step by step over to Qiao Yi. He took his jacket off and covered Qiao Yi with it, then he personally carried his corpse and left.</p><br/><p>Once a teacher, always a teacher.</p><br/><p>Even if Qiao Yi had done those sorts of things, he still could not bear to see his body exposed in the wilderness.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang watched Tang Ye\u2019s departing figure and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, boring.\u201d He did not get to fight, so Yun Shen lazily yawned.</p><br/><p>The assistant who had come along quickly rushed up to ask for instructions, \u201cCEO Yun, what do we do on the company\u2019s end? This time, the entire corporation was inflicted with serious damages. The people below are waiting for your response\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen took a look at him and said nonchalantly, \u201cOh, then I don\u2019t want it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t want it anymore?\u201d The assistant was confused.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen smiled and looked at him. \u201cFron now on, you\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m the boss?\u201d The assistant was completely puzzled. \u201cThen, what about you, CEO Yun?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-haired man looked at the faraway horizon and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be a pirate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d The assistant was stumped.</p><br/><p>On the side, when Ning Xi heard Yun Shen, she instantly frowned.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen obviously noticed her expression. He smiled faintly and said, \u201cWhat? Do you think I\u2019m going to resume my old trades and destroy the Lu family again? Hah, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not interested. This guy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen\u2019s gaze fell onto Lu Tingxiao with hints of disdain. \u201cToo boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this girl around, their previous battle was doomed to never start.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked earnestly at the person before her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen\u2019s indifferent expression suddenly looked a little unnatural. \u201cFool! There\u2019s nothing to thank me for!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he turned around to leave.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao quickly followed after him. She scuttled as she waved to Ning Xi and bade her farewell. \u201cLittle Junior Sister, I\u2019m leaving now. When your wedding happens, remember to let me know!\u201d</p><br/><p>When a certain someone who was walking fast ahead heard that, he turned around and gave Feng Xiaoxiao a furious look.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao felt attacked by the look. \u201cEh? Did I say something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Beside her, Tang Lang clicked his tongue and shook his head. <em>You have stabbed his heart, Third Junior Sister!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

He couldn\u2019t remember the last time she looked so agreeable while speaking to him.</p><br/><p>Just as he woke up, he could still catch the hint of worry and concern in her eyes, and had even heard her call him Yan brother\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi now stood by the bed, her demeanor back to being cold. \u201cYou just finished surgery, the doctors said that there is no serious issue, but you have a concussion.

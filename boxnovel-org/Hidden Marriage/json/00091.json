Don\u2019t tell me that you want her to rise from the ashes and continue acting with your Muye-gege?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing hesitated slightly for a moment, but refused to bow down in the end, \u201cI\u2019m not going! I\u2019d rather die than apologise to that bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>What effect could such a small incident have? All she had to do was buy some small gifts to buy off these people later!</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo saw that Jia Qingqing couldn\u2019t be persuaded, so she could only leave things as they were and hope that she wouldn\u2019t cause any more trouble later on.</p><br/><p>It was already a foregone conclusion that Ning Xi\u2019s reputation would be blown to bits. No matter what schemes she tried, she could only play small little tricks like these. How could she possibly turn things around?</p><br/><p>She estimated that the mysterious sponsor behind Ning Xi would dump her not long after. Who would want a lover with a terrible reputation who cheated on him?</p><br/><p>Thinking up to here, Ning Xueluo calmed down somewhat.</p><br/><p>In the end, to prevent any more conflicts arising between them, Guo Qisheng decided against filming the scene again and just used the clip where Ning Xi had spat out blood.</p><br/><p>The second scene slated for filming today was the scene where Meng Changge had just been bestowed the title of Consort, while Consort Xian lost favour and was thrown into the Cold Palace. Meng Changge entered the Cold Palace to visit Consort Xian and told Consort Xian her true identity.</p><br/><p>Luckily, this scene was rather safe. It was all expressions and dialogue, not much action.</p><br/><p>\u201c3, 2 , 1, Action!\u201d</p><br/><p>Filming started.</p><br/><p>In the Cold Palace, Consort De sat on a wide chair, looking disdainfully from the corner of her eyes at the sorry figure fallen at her feet, \u201cConsort Xian, do you know why I hate you so much? Why I had to push you to certain death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBitch! You\u2019re clearly jealous of me! Jealous that the emperor likes me! Jealous that I\u2019m favoured!\u201d</p><br/><p>Consort De laughed as if she had heard the best joke in the world, \u201cYou say that I\u2019m jealous? Of the favour of that rotten old man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort De! You\u2026 have you gone mad? I\u2019m going to tell the emperor! I\u2019m going to tell the emperor that you insulted\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Consort De abruptly shot a sinisterly cold look at her, forcing Consort Xian into silence. Following that, she spoke word by word, \u201cConsort Xian, do you know who I am? I wonder if you remember the name\u2026 Meng Changge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Jia Qingqing couldn\u2019t continue her words no matter what.</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng shouted: \u201cCut! Do it again!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second try started.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort Xian, do you know who I am? I wonder if you remember the name\u2026 Meng Changge?\u201d This time, Ning Xi\u2019s gaze was even more severe than the previous time. It clutched tightly at Jia Qingqing\u2019s throat like a noose.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You are\u2026 are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, do it again!\u201d</p><br/><p>The third try started.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort Xian, do you know who I am? I wonder if you remember the name\u2026 Meng Changge?\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s emotions were even more intense. This time, her tone was like a malicious spirit demanding for Jia Qingqing\u2019s life. Even those watching around them could feel that unceasing torrent of wrath and resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re Meng Changge? How could you be\u2026 be\u2026 be\u2026\u201d Jia Qingqing was like a recorder on loop, she had forgotten her lines again.</p><br/><p>\u201cCut!\u201d This time, Guo Qisheng finally lost all his patience and threw the screenplay. He thundered furiously: \u201cJia Qingqing, what\u2019s going on? You can\u2019t even remember such a simple line! Do you even read the script normally!\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng couldn\u2019t be blamed for getting angry. Ning Xi had pulled off the mood of the scene so well, stirring his emotions. They could have had a perfect scene, but Jia Qingqing\u2019s stupid mistake had ruined it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

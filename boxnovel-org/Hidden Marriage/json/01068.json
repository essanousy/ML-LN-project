He had not noticed her as much the other time.</p><br/><p>But today, Ning Xi wore a pink princessy dress, reminding Zhuang Zongren of the first time he saw his wife\u2026</p><br/><p>He did not expect his other granddaughter to look exactly like Ci because neither Lingyu and Keer did not.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan looked at Ning Xi\u2019s direction and tried to remember his mother\u2019s face, but because she had died when he was really young,, he had almost no recollection of his mother.</p><br/><p>He somewhat remembered a picture of his mother with his father in which she wore a pink dress as well. Most memorably, the aura of his mother from the picture was similar with Ning Xi's now.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At night, at the Zhuang family home, Zhuang Zongren had his servants prepare several delicious dishes.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Zongren\u2019s attitude towards Ning Xi before was welcoming and grateful, but today, he was even warmer and passionate.</p><br/><p>The elder kept on piling food on Ning Xi's plate.\"Xiao Xi, eat more! Eat more!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you!\" Ning Xi was a little surprised at his warm attitude.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang felt that something was not right as he munched on a chicken drumstick. He then stared at Ning Xi and suddenly stood up. \"Damn it! I remember! You\u2019re that woman who tripped me the other day!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Zongren sharply chastised him, \"Stop being noisy and sit down! And what do you mean by 'that woman'? Xiao Xi\u2019s older than you, so call her 'sister'!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang glared furiously at his father. \"I\u2019ll call her sister if I\u2019m crazy. Girl, what did I ever do to trigger you? Why have you been in my way ever since I met you?\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Liaoyuan glared at his son angrily and yelled at him, \"Stop being rude!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang looked at his grandfather, then at his father. He was exhausted. \"Why are all of you on her side!? Did you take the wrong child?! Maybe she\u2019s your real child!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Zongren\u2019s face went frigid at his grandson. \"I really hope we mistook you as our real child! Sadly, no!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang was ignored mercilessly after that.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Xi, how\u2019s your work lately? Are you tired?\" Zhuang Zongren did not bat an eyelid at his grandson and asked Ning Xi with concern.</p><br/><p>Feeling the genuine concern from the elder, Ning Xi quickly replied, \"Things are going well. I\u2019m not really tired. I like what I\u2019m doing now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, alright then. I heard from Keer that you even have a fashion apparel company of your own. Don\u2019t exhaust yourself!\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, I won't!\" Ning Xi replied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

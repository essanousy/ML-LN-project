He also had several moments where he looked like he was about to say something but stopped himself.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could not help but ask him, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Bro Tao? Be straightforward with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>It took Xu Tao some time before he mumbled, \u201cMy queen, you\u2019ll never abandon me, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ning Xi was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all because of that bastard, Wang Haojun! He\u2019s trying to get something he\u2019s unworthy of. He wants you to go over to Starlight!\u201d Xu Tao raged.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed. \u201cWell, you already said that he\u2019s unworthy, so why would I go to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m insecure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Liang Feixing came in and dragged Xu Tao aside. \u201cWhy are you doing acting like a child? I\u2019ve got goosebumps! Didn\u2019t I ask you to not bother Ning Xi? Get to work!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then turned to Ning Xi. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him, Ning Xi. He\u2019s on his period and is having some emotional distress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was helpless. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bro Tao. Su Yan did look for me last night, but I\u2019ve rejected him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! That shameless bastard! He even used Su Yan!\u201d Xu Tao scowled in frustration.</p><br/><p>However, Xu Tao was finally able to be at ease after he heard that his queen had rejected the offer, so he went back to work happily. \u201cThen, my queen, I\u2019ll head over to fetch you to the Imperial TV Station Annual anniversary!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure when the event in the evening will end. My program is near the end anyway. Bro Tao, you should go over with Qin Shuang first. I\u2019ll go over there myself after the event,\u201d said Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Xu Tao answered, totally revived.</p><br/><p>The goddess was just so kind and considerate!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At night, Xu Tao brought Qin Shuang backstage.</p><br/><p>They went into their designated dressing rooms.</p><br/><p>They soon realized that someone was already inside. Xu Tao then noticed that he had gone into the wrong room.</p><br/><p>Inside the room were Yin Youyou and her manager, two assistants, a makeup artist, two bodyguards, and practically a village was helping Yin Youyou with her makeup.</p><br/><p>Ever since she had gone to Starlight, Yin Youyou was really focused on her image as if she was afraid people did not know how well she was doing after she switched companies.</p><br/><p>A sharp-chinned assistant of Yin Youyou\u2019s saw someone come into the room. She yelled angrily at Xu Tao and Qin Shuang, \u201cWho allowed the two of you to come in? This is Youyou\u2019s exclusive dressing room!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was about to leave with Qin Shuang when he noticed he had entered the wrong room. However, having met an old enemy, he snorted at the sharp-chinned assistant. \u201cHuh, exclusive dressing room? Is your name on there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant looked at Xu Tao with a mocking attitude. \u201cXu Tao, you were a top manager back then. Although you almost became homeless, you shouldn\u2019t really act like a hobo, should you?\u201d</p><br/><p>This assistant was the one who had slapped Xu Tao and humiliated him in public. Consequently, Xu Tao became the joke of the industry after this incident was published in the papers.</p><br/><p>A former top manager had been slapped by a minor assistant in public\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

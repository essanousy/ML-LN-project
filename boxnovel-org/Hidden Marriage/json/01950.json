Ning Xi was stunned for a moment before she realized who Jace meant.</p><br/><p>A year ago, she joined Director Martin\u2019s movie \u201cThunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u201d. There were many special effect scenes in this movie, thus it had not been released up till now.</p><br/><p>Because of Jace\u2019s explanation about his daughter, plus his mention of Director Martin, Ning Xi could finally digest this huge pie\u2026</p><br/><p>After that, Ning Xi discussed some small tweaks in \u201cAssassin\u201d and the understanding of the plot in detail with Jace, only leaving in the evening.</p><br/><p>Until she walked out of the room, Ning Xi still felt like it was all very surreal.</p><br/><p>She would never have thought that initially wanting to just try for a cameo would, in the end, not only end up with her meeting the legendary Jace but also land her the leading female role.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my Lord, you\u2019re finally out! How did it actually go? What did Mr. Jace say to you? Why did you leave for so long? He didn\u2019t do anything to you, did he?!\u201d Xu Tao looked like a mother hen who was worried sick.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was a little speechless. \u201cNonsense! Mr. Jace was just discussing letting me take on the role of Anna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 the heck? What?\u201d Xu Tao almost bit his own tongue.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao had watched Hollywood\u2019s classic movie \u201cAssassin\u201d that had been honed to perfection over centuries for more than six or seven times. Naturally, he knew that the female lead\u2019s name was Anna, and she was one of the most outstanding characters in the history of Hollywood\u2019s filmography.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you say that again? What role did Mr. Jace ask you to take on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lead female assassin,\u201d replied Ning Xi expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was stunned for about three seconds before he came back to his senses. He quivered emotionally. \u201cYou got the lead female assassin\u2019s role as Anna?! Oh, my queen, please don\u2019t be joking with me. My heart isn\u2019t that great!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not that no huge stars made it to Hollywood in the entire Chinese entertainment industry, but no one had ever taken on the lead female role.</p><br/><p>Hollywood was most probably only looking for actors in China because of China\u2019s super huge market. Most of the roles offered were not even important.</p><br/><p>For a Chinese female star to land the role of the lead female role in Hollywood was practically unheard of.</p><br/><p>Even if it was the top A-lister superstar, to be able to get an important role in a Hollywood film was next to impossible.</p><br/><p>Up till now, only Song Lin had done that in the whole of the Chinese history, but that film director was an American Chinese, so most of the actors\u2019 line-up was Chinese too.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi obviously expected Xu Tao\u2019s reaction. She shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cPinch yourself for a while. If we\u2019re not dreaming right now, then this is real!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my queen, you\u2019re practically\u2026 practically a miracle! Our entire Chinese entertainment industry\u2019s pride! Damn!\u201d Xu Tao was so emotional that he was incoherent.</p><br/><p>He had never dared to imagine that in his lifetime, an artiste under him would be able to snag a lead female role in Hollywood.</p><br/><p>He could brag about this awesomeness for quite a few lifetimes!</p><br/><p>That dog crap Zheng Anru, promoting all over the place! This time, she would really become the biggest joke!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go inform the media now. I\u2019ll immediately announce it to the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Xu Tao said that he immediately shook his head again. \u201cNo, no, no, don\u2019t tell the media first. Zheng Anru\u2019s side is abuzz with the announcement. Let\u2019s wait for \u2018Assassin\u2019 to begin filming. There\u2019ll definitely be a lot of media for publicity and promotion. Let\u2019s just use Zheng Anru\u2019s publicity! Wait for a few more days till everything on Zheng Anru and Han Zixuan\u2019s end is in order. Hehehe\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

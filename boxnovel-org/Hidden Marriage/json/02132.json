He immediately picked a table, sat down, and started to pig out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, don\u2019t eat it! What if it\u2019s poisoned?\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao quickly said.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was their main force this time. If he were poisoned to death because of his gluttonous ways, it would not be logical for them to attack later.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, since Grandfather dares to eat them, then it\u2019s definitely not poisoned!\u201d Tang Lang had an unnamed confidence in Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao looked sloppy like an idiot who had zero survival skills, yet he was actually meticulous in thought.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao and Tang Ye guzzled away, but Feng Xiaoxiao and Tang Ye insisted on remaining alert. It was best to be cautious.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao, Tang Lang, Tang Ye, and Feng Xiaoxiao sat on one table while Ning Xi, Lu Tingxiao, Yun Shen, and Lu Jingli sat down on the other.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli kept examining his surroundings as he looked around with suspicion. \u201cJust this?\u201d</p><br/><p>There did not seem to be anything out of the ordinary with Heavenly Spring Resort. Even the Rothschild clansmen did not appear.</p><br/><p>What were they trying to do?</p><br/><p>As they were wondering, there were sounds of harried footsteps coming closer from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yun, Mr. Lu, I\u2019m very happy that the two of you could make it. I\u2019m extremely honored.\u201d</p><br/><p>In extremely fluent Mandarin, a man walked out from the resort as he was surrounded by others. He strolled over to the table where Lu Tingxiao and Yun Shen were.</p><br/><p>The man had the standard face of a Westerner and he was dressed luxuriously and had an extraordinary manner. His face showed a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>However, from his light blue eyes, a hint of malice hid.</p><br/><p>Surrounding the man were some respectful-looking men and women in formal clothing. They looked like the higher management and elite team of the company.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please sit!\u201d The man took a seat, then he smiled and looked towards Ning Xi charismatically. He exchanged the conventional greeting. \u201cThis must be Madam Lu. Indeed, it is as the legend says, she\u2019s a beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked. Apart from a standard smile, she did not utter a word and just stood beside Lu Tingxiao, feigning obedience.</p><br/><p>On the neighboring table, Tang Lang, Tang Ye, and Feng Xiaoxiao exchanged a look. They were constantly maintaining their guard.</p><br/><p>As for a certain Master, as usual, he kept eating and did not look up at all\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the European King?\u201d Yun Shen looked at the man and sized him up for a moment, then he smiled profoundly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that the person in charge of the Rothschild clan, whose name shocked the entire Europe, would be this young?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were clearly undermining the identity of this man before them.</p><br/><p>The man did not mind. He smiled and answered politely, \u201cMr. Yun, it\u2019s not like that. The European King was just a title that was passed down. I\u2019m no European King.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Lu Tingxiao said with an indifferent tone, \u201cEveryone\u2019s here, Third Master. You can be frank.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard Lu Tingxiao address him as \u201cThird Master\u201d, the man\u2019s light blue eyes instantly showed a hint of astonishment.</p></div>\n</div>"}

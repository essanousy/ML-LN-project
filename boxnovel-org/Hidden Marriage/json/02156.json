I\u2019m helping her to get a spare one. Why\u2026 are you here alone? Everyone\u2019s at the front,\u201d Ning Tianxin said.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian came back to his senses. \u201cI\u2026 I hung around with them a little too late last night and didn\u2019t really get a good night\u2019s sleep, so I\u2019m looking for a place to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are some guest rooms upstairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had nothing else to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on with my errand.\u201d Ning Tianxin nodded and passed him.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian still remained stationary after the girl left. He tried to recall the girl\u2019s face, her voice, and her expression as she spoke to him just now.</p><br/><p>She had really moved on\u2026</p><br/><p>That was great\u2026</p><br/><p>As the wedding was about to start soon, Ning Xi was making some final preparations in the dressing room when Tang Lang barged right in.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Sister, look who\u2019s here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi doubtfully turned around and her eyes brightened in the next moment. \u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides, there was a girl beside Han Xiao. While there were some pretty drastic changes about her aura and the way she dressed, she easily recognized her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy marriage.\u201d The girl seemed strange, yet a sense of familiarity appeared in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Ning Xi could not find the right words to say at the moment. While the person before her was Annie, at the same time, she was not Annie.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d The girl looked down ashamedly. \u201cI remembered everything a while back. Although I did lose my memories, I did something very hurtful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang tried to soften the mood. \u201cIt\u2019s a happy day today. Don\u2019t mention those unhappy stories!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi also comforted, \u201cLet the past stay in the past! As long as you\u2019re happy with the Master now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was relieved when she knew that Annie now remembered everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Youge, when are we getting married?\u201d Han Xiao asked.</p><br/><p>The girl replied coldly, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say marriage is such a troublesome thing that you\u2019d never do it in your life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang and Ning Xi were speechless.</p><br/><p><em>Master, how could you say that?! How could you?</em></p><br/><p>A certain Master feigned innocence. \u201cReally? Did I say it was troublesome? Aside from you, I\u2019ll never want anyone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were once again speechless.</p><br/><p>As expected of the Master!</p><br/><p><em>We were wrong!</em></p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>With the sound of the waves crashing against the beach, the church bells started ringing and wedding music started playing.</p><br/><p>The wedding had finally begun.</p><br/><p>Everyone was focused on the attractive lovebirds of the day.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s eyes teared up. \u201cI\u2019m so touched! My brother is finally married!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye handed over a packet of tissues with a disgusted expression. \u201cWorry about yourself more! After he\u2019s done, we\u2019ll be next!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was speechless. He swore to himself he would run away from home after this wedding!</p><br/><p>Behind the church, no one noticed a man with white hair.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s usual casual wear was nowhere to be seen. He was wearing a full formal suit and his hair was also combed up. He held a bouquet of flowers in his hand.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he was looking at the girl walking towards the priest with another man\u2026</p><br/><p>He had flowers and dressed up formally\u2026</p><br/><p>Just to miss it\u2026</p><br/><p>The man seemed impatient. He thrust the flowers into the hands of a man beside him. \u201cSo troublesome! Who made the rule that people must give wedding presents? Give them the stuff we just grabbed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d replied Tang Ye.</p><br/><p>Those were not something they \u201cjust\u201d grabbed at all. It was all the best loot they had this year.</p><br/><p>Like a dragon protecting its treasure, he was now willing to give all of them away.</p><br/><p>A man who never knew the meaning of love finally realized it because of one girl.</p><br/><p>The wedding went on as the pair of lovebirds stood before the priest.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Lu Tingxiao, are you willing to take Ms. Ning Xi as your wife? Do you pledge to love her, swear loyalty to her, and even in poverty, illness, and challenges, you\u2019d stay by her side until the end of your life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Ning Xi, are you willing to take Mr. Lu Tingxiao as your husband? Do you pledge to love him, swear loyalty to him, and even in poverty, illness, and challenges, you\u2019d stay by his side until the end of your life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gazed at the man before her quietly. This was the man who insisted on marrying her the first time he saw her, the man who was always by her side no matter what happened, and the man who still married her even when he was alone\u2026</p><br/><p>Luckily\u2026</p><br/><p>Luckily, this time, she did not leave him alone.</p><br/><p>There was a hint of glistening tears in the corner of the girl\u2019s eyes. Her tone was heartfelt like never before as if she was handing her life over to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>-THE END-</p></div>\n</div>"}

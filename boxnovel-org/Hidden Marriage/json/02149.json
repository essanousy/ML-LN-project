Ning Xi has finally made it to this stage, and now are we going to ruin it all for a bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>With Ning Xi\u2019s acknowledgment, the crowd started to riot again and everyone began to push forward like mad.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, behind the crowd, there was suddenly an ear-piercing sound of a car hitting the brakes. Seven to eight black cars had stopped in uniform across the hotel.</p><br/><p>More than 20 well-trained bodyguards in black got down from the car one after another. The door of the leading car was opened by a bodyguard and a tall, lofty man with an icy-cold face got down from the car.</p><br/><p>Someone in the crowd instantly cried out in surprise when they recognized who it was. \u201cOh my God! It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s Lu Tingxiao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh gosh! I\u2019m about to go crazy! It really looks like him!

Iit was as if storm clouds were approaching. He took huge strides and was walking towards the crowd.</p><br/><p>Those bodyguards all had a solemn expression on their faces while the man leading them had an even more terrifying aura around him as if anyone who exchanged a look with him could have their blood frozen.</p><br/><p>The chaotic crowd all subconsciously opened up a path.</p><br/><p>The further inwards the man went, the scarier his face looked. One could almost hear the sound of him stepping on ice slags wherever he walked.</p><br/><p>Finally, under everyone\u2019s watchful eyes, the man unexpectedly walked right up to Ning Xi. His face seemed to have an incredibly turbulent storm and terrifying hostility written on it. He stared straight at this pale-looking girl and his expression darkened as he lifted the girl by her waist\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! This\u2026\u201d The crowd let out a startled cry.</p><br/><p>Even though Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face was extremely scary, but the way he carried the girl was beyond careful. He even seemed a little at a loss, unsure where to touch her. It was as if just touching her would hurt her. From the crowd\u2019s point of view, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s movements even seemed a little clumsy\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! What\u2026 what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God! Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Apart from the media and fans, Xu Tao was probably the most shocked one. At this moment, Xu Tao watched blankly as the Big Boss carried Ning Xi. His expression was the same as a fool.</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026 could it be that the bastard who had impregnated Ning Xi was\u2026</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing let out a long sigh of relief.

This is crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing\u2026 Ning Xi\u2019s child is Lu Tingxiao\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am indeed a married man,\u201d the man continued to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the crowd\u2019s shocked and taunting gazes towards Ning Xi could start, they heard the man continue, \u201cNing Xi and I have already been registered for two years, six months and 17 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless yet again.</p><br/><p>They must be dreaming\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the entertainment industry\u2019s heaviest-duty, most shocking, big news of the year!</p><br/><p>The queen of movies, Ning Xi was pregnant, and the child\u2019s father was unexpectedly the executive director of the Lu Corporation, Lu Tingxiao.

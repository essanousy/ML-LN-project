She was begging for forgiveness on the ground in desperation. \u201cMrs. Yi, it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Please forgive me just this once\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Jiang Manli was not an easygoing person. She had someone get her a chair and she sat on it before she gestured to Yi Xudong to massage her shoulders as she ordered her henchmen to continue.</p><br/><p>The fuss continued until the police got involved.</p><br/><p>passersby took photos and videos of what happened and it was shared with every corner of the Internet.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan had no idea how she escaped the nightmare. Out of fear, she rushed into an underground car park.</p><br/><p>A car came around the corner quickly and braked, causing a loud screech before it stopped right before Han Zixuan.</p><br/><p>The driver quickly came out of the car to see what had happened, then he realized that it was a girl in a mess.</p><br/><p>The man was taken aback when he saw the girl\u2019s face. \u201cHan Zixuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan was stunned when she saw that it was someone she knew. \u201cC-CEO Su\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Su Yan frowned.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan could not say anything. She broke down and started crying.</p><br/><p>Su Yan looked at Han Zixuan who had scratches all over her body and somewhat guessed what had happened, but he did not point it out.</p><br/><p>After all, if Han Zixuan had not decided to release the video of her conversation with Ning Xueluo, things would not have ended up like this. Ning Xi\u2019s misunderstanding of him would not have gone any further.</p><br/><p>He certainly did not have a favorable impression of Han Zixuan.</p><br/><p>Su Yan gave her his coat and then left in his car.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan clutched onto the coat tightly as she stared at the car with hateful eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Spirit Studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Big news! Look at this, Boss. Han Zixuan was stripped naked and beaten up by Yi Xudong\u2019s wife in public! It\u2019s all over the Net now! How satisfying!\u201d Han Momo skipped over to Ning Xi gleefully, her face brimming with a big smile.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi only glanced at her and then looked away. Her eyes focused back on Gong Shangze\u2019s drafts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two bastards, Ning Xueluo and Su Yan, are really frustrating. They still dare to post pictures of them being lovey-dovey!\u201d Han Momo looked unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked helpless. \u201cStop looking at gossip all day. Lorraine International Fashion Week is happening next month. Have you arranged the schedule?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all done. I\u2019ll never be behind on my work!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHistory is so shameless. They copied our style again and again, then even accused us of plagiarizing then. We\u2019ll defeat them for sure this time!\u201d Han Momo said angrily.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put the drafts down and walked over to Gong Shangze as he was quiet the whole time and seemed unfocused. \u201cZe, what are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze seemed like he wanted to say something, but then he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi narrowed her eyes and asked, \u201cDoes David still have your drafts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze bit his lip. \u201cI thought about it. There shouldn\u2019t be any left, but I can\u2019t be sure if I left something out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi understood Gong Shangze\u2019s worries. His biggest challenge was to surpass himself.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze pursed his lips, then he looked at Ning Xi. \u201cBoss, will you be there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded. \u201cOf course, how can I not be present at such a crucial moment? I should be at Lorraine filming at that time. I\u2019ll be sure to head over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze\u2019s uneasy expression faded away after he heard Ning Xi\u2019s reply. His eyes brightened up. \u201cBoss, I won\u2019t let you down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze then asked, \u201cBoss, during this time, is it alright if I stay over at your place in Deer Town for several days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied swiftly, \u201cOf course, you can! Your inspiration really flowed well there, didn\u2019t it? Even I miss that place a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze did not explain. He just nodded. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

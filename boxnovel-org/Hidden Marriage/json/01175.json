This guy was too good at looking for trouble!</p><br/><p>\"Fatso, listen to me, let go.\" Han Xiao smiled at him.</p><br/><p>\"Who did you just call a fatso? I'm going to punch you to death!\" The fat student became even angrier.</p><br/><p>\"Fatso, do you believe that I can kill you with just a finger?\" Han Xiao's smile vanished.</p><br/><p>\"You're dead!\" The fat student yelled at Han Xiao and then launched a punch at him.</p><br/><p>Before his punch even reached Han Xiao, a shadow of a finger sliced through. In the blink of an eye, before Han Xiao's finger even reached him, the force of his finger blew a gust of wind at the fat student's hair. He then pointed his finger at the fatso's torso.</p><br/><p>The onlookers did not know what happened, but they saw the 120-kilogram student fly across the room all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The fat student crashed on the floor hard. He groaned as he covered his torso with both hands.</p><br/><p>\"See! I told you so but you didn't believe me.\" Han Xiao sat back on the floor and giggled.</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked. Had the sissy-looking man really used just a finger to make the fat student fly across the room?</p><br/><p>\"Who's that monster?\"</p><br/><p>\"DId he just make Weiqiang fly that far away with just a finger?\"</p><br/><p>\"Skills?! Inner strength? Don't tell me he came here from the ancient kungfu times!?\"</p><br/><p>\"You watch too much drama series!\"</p><br/><p>\"Such explosive power with that tiny body frame! Could he have used force?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Force? What force?\"</p><br/><p>\"You guys don't know? I read about it in an ancient book. People train strength first, then only revise their form. As the form matures, it becomes a skill. At the end of a skill, it becomes force, hidden force, transformed force, the training of Qi, et cetera!\" A middle-aged man explained.</p><br/><p>\"Bro Liang, are you serious about what you just said? All that is real?\"</p><br/><p>\"You youngsters are too young to understand. Of course, it's real. It's recorded in an ancient book. You think it's fake just because you don't know about it.\" The middle-aged man shook his head.</p><br/><p>\"Ancient book? I bet, Bro Liang, you've read too many martial arts novels!\"</p><br/><p>\"Fine, take it as I'm lying. You guys are the best, go and fight him!\" The middle-aged man shrugged.</p><br/><p>Everyone shook their heads. Even a fat guy was blown away with just his finger, so who would dare to fight him?!</p><br/><p>\"Sorry... I'm really sorry!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was embarrassed as she dragged Han Xiao to flee from the Taekwondo center. She just wanted to find a place for Han Xiao to teach her a few skills, but who knew this would happen?</p><br/><p>\"You're really good at causing trouble.\" Ning Xi glared at Han Xiao after she stopped the car.</p><br/><p>\"Lady, it was those people who wanted to attack me.\" Han Xiao put on an innocent expression.</p><br/><p>\"Would they attack you if you didn't call them trash?\" Ning Xi was helpless.</p><br/><p>\"They really are trash.\" Han Xiao thought about it.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's mouth twitched. She had no comeback to this.</p><br/><p>\"Just some fancy moves, there's nothing interesting.\" Han Xiao said with a bored face</p><br/>\n</div>"}

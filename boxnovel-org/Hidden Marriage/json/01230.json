The people were already extremely angry about the current local movie industry. Zheng Kangde now felt the full counter of rage from everyone.</p><br/><p>On that day, People's Cinema raised the showtime frequency for \"Dream Chaser\" to 50%. Soon after, all the other cinemas also followed suit. Some of them even allocated staggering numbers of up to 70% to recover back their losses\u2026</p><br/><p>Inside Oriental Cinema's meeting room, compared to the stiff and arrogant environment a few days ago, all the stakeholders and management staff pasted big smiles on their faces.</p><br/><p>On the big screen, numbers showed that Oriental Cinema had risen up to the top spot. Everyone praised Fang Jiayue.</p><br/><p>\"As expected of CEO Fang! Amateurs like us just can't make it!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's great. Just because we increased showtimes frequency for 'Dream Chaser' on the second day, everyone is commending us! The loss on the first two days is just a small matter!\"</p><br/><p>\"All thanks to CEO Fang's decisiveness, we were able to reach the top this time!\"</p><br/><p>\"I heard that all the other cinemas are increasing the showtimes frequency as well, haha. It has already been a week! That's kinda late for that\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"CEO Fang looked far into the future. I can't believe that I doubted her decision before. I still have a lot to learn from CEO Fang!\" Vice President Fang Yong, who had thought he might be able to replace Fang Jiayue this time, put on a bitter fake smile.</p><br/><p>He did not expect a small production movie to become such a big hit. He also did not expect that after ten years, Chen Mian would create another legend.</p><br/><p>Over on Ning Xi's side, she received a call from Chen Mian early in the morning. \"Xiao Xi, we've reached $ 500 million at the box office, but don't post your picture first. I'll get Chen Hanchan to post his reward photo for $ 500 million. We'll keep yours for last! Post it when we reach a billion!\"</p><br/><p>\"A billion?\" Ning Xi was taken aback.</p><br/><p>\"Why? Are you not confident?\" Chen Mian teased her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed, \"We're going to make it if you say so!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Lu Corporation, in the staff pantry, a few girls were complaining.</p><br/><p>\"Did you guys get tickets to watch 'Dream Chaser'?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, the cinema near us added a lot of showtimes, but the tickets were all gone in just two hours! Crazy!\"</p><br/><p>\"I got myself a pair. I have two friends who wanted to watch as well, but they couldn't get any!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As they were chatting, two people entered the pantry.</p><br/><p>\"Bro Xiong! Bro Xiao!\" The staff greeted warmly when they saw the CEO's personal bodyguards. Shi Xiao and Xiong Zhi whipped out a stack of movie tickets. They were all tickets to watch \"Dream Chaser\".</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\" The group of employees was confused.</p><br/><p>\"Go and distribute it to everyone! It's free!\" Shi Xiao generously said.</p><br/><p>\"Let us know if it's not enough!\" Zhi Xiong added.</p><br/><p>The girls looked at each other, then grabbed the tickets swiftly. After the duo left, they discussed among themselves.</p><br/><p>\"What's happening?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't know, could they be Bro Xi's fans?\"</p><br/><p>\"Uhh...you think they like Bro Xi in a female outfit or a male outfit...haha\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, in a female outfit! But...it's possible that they might like the other one as well, hehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

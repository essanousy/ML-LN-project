And he\u2019s five now?! The most illogical thing is...can you even bear a child?\" Tang Lang was shocked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had changed into a male outfit after she got back to avoid him overreacting from seeing her in a girl\u2019s outfit. But even if she was wearing a man\u2019s outfit, she was still a woman biologically\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m a woman, alright? Why can\u2019t I bear a child?!\" Ning Xi erupted.</p><br/><p>\"Is he...really your son?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him and huffed, \"Lu Tingxiao\u2019s son is my son, okay?\"</p><br/><p>Tang Lang clacked, \"I thought it was really your kid! Speaking of which, aren\u2019t you treating his son a bit too well?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mind your own business! Are you taking this job or not?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, as long as it pays, I\u2019ll do anything!\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s decided then. You\u2019ll teach on the weekend because he has to go school on weekdays. There will be a three months probation period. I\u2019ll fire you if you\u2019re not doing a good job,\" Ning Xi said seriously.</p><br/><p>\"Tsk tsk\u2026\" Tang Lang shook his head.</p><br/><p>\"What is it?\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019ve changed after you become someone\u2019s woman! My dear Little Junior Sister is never coming back again!\"</p><br/><p>\"If even you can become a security guard, anything is possible!\"</p><br/><p>After chatting for some time, Ning Xi suddenly remembered an important question to ask.</p><br/><p>\"Second Senior Brother, does Lu Tingxiao know about my past? And my relationship to you?\"</p><br/><p>Tang Lang sipped his tea and answered,\"Probably!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed in relief after she heard his reply. Actually, Lu Tingxiao had already seen what happened at the arsenal in Philadelphia, so it did not really matter if he knew or not.</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi was thinking to herself, Tang Lang spoke up, \"Aside from that certain someone, I didn\u2019t expect Lu Tingxiao to have such weird taste in women!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi narrowed her eyes at him. \"Hey! What do you mean? How am I weird?\"</p><br/><p>\"Isn\u2019t liking you weird enough?\"</p><br/><p>Fine, it was weird\u2026</p><br/><p>At Regal Riveria Hotel.</p><br/><p>As she reached home, Ning Xi saw a man with sunglasses and a face mask squatting in front of her apartment.</p><br/><p>\"Blondie? Why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Where have you been? I\u2019m almost frozen to death. Quickly open the door!\" Jiang Muye urged.</p><br/><p>It really was him\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took her keys out and opened the door, then she poured him a glass of hot water. \"Did you just come from the signing ceremony?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm,\" Jiang Muye mumbled.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you suddenly here? I thought you\u2019re never talking to me anymore!\" Ning Xi raised her eyebrows teasingly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye fumed, \"You yourself said that you\u2019ll never settle down for any man!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah, love just came like a hurricane!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye suppressed his urge to punch her as he took a deep breath. \"I\u2019m here to tell you that...if Ling Zhizhi were to tell you anything about me...do not believe her!\"</p><br/><p>\"What is she going to tell me?\"</p><br/><p>\"No matter what she says, just don\u2019t believe her!\" Jiang Muye huffed impatiently, putting his face mask back on. \"I\u2019m leaving!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ugh\u2026\" Ning Xi was speechless.

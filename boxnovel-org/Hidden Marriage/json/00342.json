It was a good thing that the manager had seen this low-profile boss before, so he recognized him instantly after such a memorable first impression.</p><br/><p>The manager knew that the boss did not like people to know who he was, so he just addressed him as Mr. Lu.</p><br/><p>\"Put everyone's tabs on me,\" Lu Tingxiao declared casually.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, no problem!\" the manager quickly replied.</p><br/><p>Everyone cheered hearing Lu Tingxiao\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Just by observing the manager\u2019s nervous behaviour, one could decipher that this man was a big shot and was probably filthy rich. What he just did only further confirmed it.</p><br/><p>The lady looked at Lu Tingxiao greedily since she just saw how generous he was. She could not wait anymore. She walked towards him with a pounding heart, introducing herself, \"So, Mr. Lu, I\u2019m Wang Ruolan from the Wang corporation. I wonder if you're working right now and if I would be fortunate enough to have a private conversation with you over some drinks?\"</p><br/><p>A handsome face combined together with a charm and a strong financial background...what a package. All the customers\u2019 bills tonight would easily reach tens of millions, but this man seemed like he did not care at all. How attractive was that?</p><br/><p>And his surname was Lu, could he possibly be related to the legendary family from the Imperial?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao just glanced at the lady with a cold expression and told her, \"For this question, you\u2019d need to check with someone else. If she\u2019s okay with it, then I have no objections.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is it?\" the lady quickly asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded his head towards Ning Xi. \"Her.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was surprised and speechless.</p><br/><p>\"What, ask this witch?\" The lady was shocked and confused.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao gave her a cold stare, \"Excuse me, miss, please take back what you\u2019ve just said and apologize to her. She\u2019s the apple of my eye.\"</p><br/><p>As if his words were not shocking enough, he added further, \"Too bad, she still isn\u2019t mine.\"</p><br/><p>\"The\u2026the apple of your eye?\" the lady yelled in disbelief. \"How\u2026how is this possible?!</p><br/><p>A man like this should only be worthy of someone of her own status, but he was going for such a dirty woman?</p><br/><p>\"You actually fancy a woman like this? Do you know how dirty she is and how many people she\u2019s slept with before?\" the lady could not accept this truth.</p><br/><p>\"Lu\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi saw that Lu Tingxiao was arguing for her sake and wanted to stop him, but he just calmly gave her a warning glance, and softly said, \"It\u2019s okay, leave it to me.\"</p><br/><p>The lady\u2019s face turned really red seeing how gentle Lu Tingxiao treated Ning Xi. She said, \"Mr. Lu, don\u2019t be deceived by someone like her. She\u2019s just playing hard to get. In the end, she just wants more money!\"</p><br/><p>She threw all her money and cards from her purse at Ning Xi\u2019s feet, \"Get away from this man! How much do you want? Name me a price!\"</p><br/><p>The few women beside the lady went along with her, \"Don\u2019t people like you just want money? Name a price, our Sis Lan will be able to afford it!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao just quietly looked at the lady crazily throwing her money, then calmly said, \"Aside from being the apple of my eye, she\u2019s my superior, as well as my boss. Tonight, the one who\u2019s really treating everyone to drinks is her. So, you\u2019re now not only drinking my boss\u2019 alcohol, but also insulting her. If possible, please throw up all the drinks you\u2019ve drank before.\"</p><br/><p>Regardless of everyone\u2019s expression of disbelief, Lu Tingxiao looked at the speechless Mister Li, \"Of course, you as well.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That night, another pregnant woman was also sent in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked, even though he had roughly guessed what had happened next.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged, \u201cIt caused a drama! That small hospital had very few staff and a disorganised system, so the two female babies were swapped\u2026 and this mistake continued for 18 years! Did you know? Ning Xueluo even has the same blood type as me, so this matter stayed hidden!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how was it discovered later on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned and smiled at Lu Tingxiao, \u201cThis, well, I should thank that unbridled uncle of mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Yaobang? Lu Tingxiao had some impression of him, but didn\u2019t know much. He only knew that he was one of the more well-known people amongst the younger generation back then in the capital.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. My uncle was a playboy. Even after marriage, he continued sowing his wild oats outside and even caused quite a few deaths\u2026 He has one son and three daughters in total!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s something wrong with the fengshui at the Ning family. When it came to their generation, for some reason, both Ning Yaohua and Ning Yaobang weren\u2019t able to birth legitimate sons. My uncle\u2019s bastard son became the only male successor for this generation of the Ning family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy uncle was rather cocky at that time and thought that he could finally become the successor to the family. However, in the end, they discovered that that only male son wasn\u2019t even his, he had been cheated on by that girl he had outside, haha! Can you guess what happened next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was completely in love with that bright sparkle in her eyes. He seemed to ponder the question before answering, \u201cThen your grandfather forced all the Ning family\u2019s grandchildren to go through a DNA test, and found out that Ning Xueluo wasn\u2019t even part of the Ning family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi showed a gloomy expression, \u201cCan\u2019t you play along? There\u2019s no point in trying to keep you in suspense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled gently, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll improve next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi harrumphed once before she continued narrating, \u201cAnyway, once they started investigating, they found out that I had been swapped with Ning Xueluo at the hospital back then, so I was brought back to the Ning family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her speak of this matter so casually, Lu Tingxiao stroked her head lightly, \u201cThey treated you badly?\u201d</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t thought much of it at first, but for some reason, upon receiving that gentle pat from Lu Tingxiao, she suddenly felt like she had suffered a major grievance.</p><br/><p>As expected, it was only when someone cared about you that you would feel aggrieved. If no one cared about you, who would you complain to?</p><br/><p>Seeing the girl\u2019s downcast appearance, Lu Tingxiao magnanimously spread open his arms, \u201cI can lend you my embrace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s expression turned a little startled before she turned away, \u201cI don\u2019t want it! You\u2019re trying to entice me into committing a crime, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t say anything more, but continued looking at her with his full attention, \u201cWhat about your adopted parents? Did they treat you well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking of her adopted parents, Ning Xi recovered a little of her spirit, \u201cMy grandmother favoured sons over daughters and didn\u2019t like me a lot. When I was born, she almost tossed me into the river to drown. She did throw me in the river once, but my dad picked me up and took me home. My mum\u2026 she treated me very well. I also have a very sensible and obedient little brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that she had almost been thrown into the river to drown, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s heart clenched. When she mentioned her mother, her expression didn\u2019t seem right, but he didn\u2019t ask any further.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really liked my original home. When they told me I wasn\u2019t their biological child, it felt like the sky had just fallen on me. However, with the Ning family\u2019s power, I didn\u2019t even have the freedom to choose. If I had resisted with all my might back then, perhaps there would have been a shred of hope that I wouldn\u2019t have had to leave, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

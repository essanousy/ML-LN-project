Yet he hadn\u2019t even mentioned anything to her when something so big had happened?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately called him to ask.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s tone didn\u2019t sound very good, \u201cWhy would I talk to you about it? Weren\u2019t you resenting me for giving you trouble? Didn\u2019t you want me to mind my own business? Didn\u2019t you want me to get as far away from you as possible! Well, your wish has been granted!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ning Xi\u2019s temper rose, \u201cJiang Muye, did you eat gunpowder?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was feeling extremely stifled. He was angry at himself, angry over the fact that he had been so stupid. Finally, he suppressed his emotions and calmed down before speaking, \u201cI\u2019m at my dad\u2019s company now and I\u2019ve been running about like a dog the whole day. I can\u2019t get away from this mess. If you have the time tonight, login to the game. I sent something to you. Happy birthday!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I sent some things to your email. Look at them yourself, it\u2019s up to you whether you want to believe them or not! That\u2019s all, bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow\u2026\u201d Ning Xi looked at her phone grudgingly after the call cut.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Guo Qisheng came over to inform her, \u201cNing Xi, I believe you\u2019ve heard about Muye\u2019s matter! You were supposed to continue filming that kissing scene today, but we\u2019ve switched it to a match between you and Xueluo. I\u2019ll get someone to send you the new schedule later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded, \u201cI got it, Director!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said so, she found a remote corner and nestled under the shade of a tree to read the script.</p><br/><p>While engrossed in reading, the sound of footsteps came to her ears. From the corner of her eyes, she caught sight of a figure that brought up a natural response of disgust; it was Su Yan who was walking over.</p><br/><p>It had been Su Yan who had sent over Ning Xueluo today. Since it was her birthday, Su Yan had applied for a day\u2019s leave and had been accompanying her all day on set. The ladies on set were all going crazy from jealousy.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t have the patience to speak with him, so she only lifted her gaze, asking him whether he had any business with her.</p><br/><p>Su Yan held out an ice-cold beverage to her before carefully asking, \u201cXiao Xi, you\u2019ll come to Xueluo\u2019s birthday, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t take the bottle. She looked at him as if she were looking at an idiot, \u201cAre you sure you want to ask me such an obvious question?</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi, it\u2019s your birthday today as well. If you can come, we can celebrate your birthday too! I\u2019ve already spoken to Uncle and Aunt about it, and they\u2019ve agreed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes, \u201cWow, thanks for celebrating my birthday in passing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s brows drew together in a frown before he gave a long sigh, \u201cNing Xi, I feel like I don\u2019t know you anymore. When can you return to being the kind and considerate Xiao Xi from back then\u2026 Ultimately, everything that had happened back then was my fault. If not for me, Xueluo wouldn\u2019t have done something like that. If you want to blame someone, then blame me. Xueluo is innocent. All these years, she\u2019s been living in guilt. What she really hopes for is to get your blessing. I really hope you can come!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuilt?\u201d Every time she spoke with Su Yan, Ning Xi felt like she was listening to a huge joke, \u201cIs she guilty that she\u2019s occupying my position? Guilty that she stole away my parents? Guilty that she slept with my man? Then she really has enough to be guilty about! Also, don\u2019t mention being kind to me. Back then, I wasn\u2019t being kind, I was being a damn idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s expression turned ugly, but he continued speaking with a staunch look, \u201cXiao Xi, as long as you agree to forgive Xueluo, other than having me testify in court, I\u2019ll do whatever you want!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Ning Xi raised an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Su Yan nodded.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

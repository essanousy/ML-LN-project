The last time Ning Xi had stolen her limelight with a white <em>qipao,</em> she had never been this mad.</p><br/><p>As Zheng Anru watched the way Han Zixuan was about to lose control, then she quickly went over to console her, \u201cZixuan, don\u2019t be angry. Don\u2019t be angry. Don\u2019t bother with that witch who only knows how to pull tricks, even though she humiliated us, but with her terrible looks, she won\u2019t even be able to pull the fans\u2019 votes! Our ultimate goal for tonight is still the poll! Later on, when you snag all of the top spots, we\u2019ll viciously slap her in the face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want all of the rankings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After they settled into their seats, Jiang Muye shot Ning Xi a look with an indescribable expression. \u201cWho gave you this idea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ning Xi raised her brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too savage!\u201d Jiang Muye said it as it was.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a head suddenly popped in from behind. Xu Tao said unhappily, \u201cHey, how can you say that?! Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s super awesome? We made Han Zixuan furious, and we can save money too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cYour main point is that it saves money, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao said earnestly, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that. Everything I do is for the company!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was speechless.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was sharp!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t this a little too lacking in taste?! Whatever it is, you should at least respect the organizer. shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Jiang Muye grumbled.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi leaned her head on her hand as she said nonchalantly, \u201cWhat are you worried for? There\u2019s still the award ceremony, later on. I\u2019ll change then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was speechless.</p><br/><p>With that tone that said, \u201cI still have time to be cool after I win\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>Did she have to be so arrogant?</p><br/><p>At this moment, the camera suddenly focused on them. Ning Xi instantly revealed a smile and greeted the fans behind the camera.</p><br/><p>A smile could overturn a state\u2026 that was how it was done.</p><br/><p>On the huge screen, Ning Xi\u2019s votes were swiftly increasing.</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan\u2019s votes were twice the number of Ning Xi\u2019s, and could not be surpassed by Ning Xi\u2019s bit of increment. However, the votes in Starlight\u2019s hands had already all been thrown out, so they had basically reached their peak.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye subconsciously looked to the side. Ning Xi\u2019s soft and cozy outfit was close to a stay-at-home look, and with her gentle hair that casually draped over her shoulders, plus that spring breeze-like smile on her face, it was actually\u2026 even more breathtaking than her usual stunning and glittery look.</p><br/><p>There was a kind of harmless energy that warmed one\u2019s heart, making one feel that the person before them was light all over, engulfed by love, to the extent that anyone who looked at her would be infected by such a beautiful feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour outfit\u2026 Was it designed by your Imperial designer again?\u201d Jiang Muye could not help but ask.</p><br/><p>That guy was too amazing. How could he always tap into this girl\u2019s extraordinary aura and moving elements?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked proud as she nodded. \u201cYep, it\u2019s a new design.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo quickly? A new one again? Weren\u2019t new designs just recently released?\u201d Jiang Muye was shocked.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The girl already started complaining at the bottom of the mountain, \"My gosh! It's so high! Are we really walking all the way up? I can imagine that I'll die halfway!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's alright, I'll carry you if you're tired!\"</p><br/><p>\"You're the best!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When he heard the newlywed's conversation, Lu Tingxiao looked at the girl beside him. \"Still feeling tired?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pouted, \"It's all your fault!\"</p><br/><p>He had made the little bun unhappy last night, so she had to make up to him and only got a few hours of sleep.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao understood what Ning Xi meant but it was a totally different thing from the perspective of the others and their wild imaginations ran...</p><br/><p>So, they really did make up! Did they do it all night long?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao walked in front of the girl as she yawned and he bent over. \"Get on.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\"Get on me and continue sleeping.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" Ning Xi was really tempted by his broad back and she quickly jumped on him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao adjusted his position and started walking with Ning Xi on his back. Everyone was speechless by what they saw.</p><br/><p>\"Even a married couple lost to them!\"</p><br/><p>\"That guy was ready to carry his wife if she was tired but Lu Tingxiao is already carrying Ning Xi before they even started!\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm impressed by Bro Xiao!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha, I would never believe that Lu Tingxiao has this side of him a few years back but now I'm already used to it!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>They were halfway to the top and Ning Xi had slept through the whole journey. Lu Tingxiao continued without any sign of fatigue even with her on his back.</p><br/><p>A few people were panting behind him, \"CEO Lu has...too much...stamina\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The group was chatting along the way and the camaraderie was great, except for Lu Xinyan and a few girls who were friendly with Guan Ziyao.</p><br/><p>Lu Xinyan chased up with Lu Tingxiao and said, \"Bro, there's still a long way ahead! How long does she plan to sleep? Is she trying to tire you out!?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi frowned a little because of the noise and Lu Tingxiao looked at Lu Xinyan coldly. \"Quiet.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Xinyan was so frustrated!</p><br/><p>At the back of the hiking group, Guan Ziyao's doubts grew stronger when she watched Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, they reached the mountaintop around evening. After a short rest, everyone started setting up camp. Guan Ziyao could not hold it in anymore and went up to Lu Tingxiao. \"Tingxiao, can I speak to you for a moment?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at Ning Xi who was setting up the tent.</p><br/><p>As she was focused on the tent, she signaled to him to go ahead with Guan Ziyao.</p><br/><p>It's probably hard for Guan Ziyao to hold it in this long\u2026</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao felt humiliated by Ning Xi's indifferent attitude. Where did her confidence come from?</p><br/><p>As they walked a distance away from the campsite, Guan Ziyao asked, \"Tingxiao, did you see the message and photos I sent you last night?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\" Lu Tingxiao was still looking at Ning Xi even though Guan Ziyao was talking to him.</p><br/><p>\"Did you see Ning Xi together with that man?\" Guan Ziyao confirmed with him again.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Lu Tingxiao still looked calm.</p><br/><p>Was that all he had to react to this?</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao took a deep breath and asked again, \"Then...what do you think?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao replied, \"Those are some nice pictures, thank you.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m just saying that I\u2019ve seen something similar near Ms. Ning Xi\u2019s place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the few of them could come up with a conclusion, Zhuang Lingyu, who was on the bed, turned blank for a few minutes. Suddenly, she was extremely emotional as she sat up. \u201cNing Xi! It\u2019s her\u2026 It\u2019s that damned brat\u2026 It must be her\u2026 Apart from her, who else would hate me this much? Hate the child in me this much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xueluo saw that Zhuang Lingyu had already set her mind on Ning Xi and did not care what the others said after the maid had just simply said a few words, the corner of her mouth faintly curled up. She quickly pretended to console, \u201cMother, calm down. It\u2019s just the maid\u2019s one-sided story. In fact, she\u2019s said that she\u2019s not sure! I think that even though Sister has some misunderstanding with us, she wouldn\u2019t go to the extent of doing something so terrifying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Zhuang Lingyu heard those words from the maid and heard Ning Xi\u2019s name, she had already tuned everything else out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else could it be if not her!? She wouldn\u2019t go to that extent? Hasn\u2019t she done a lot of those evil and scary things? Xueluo! Did you forget how she treated you! She ruined your career, your reputation, and your company one step at a time! She pushed you to the edge! It\u2019s not enough that she\u2019s ruined one of my children, but now she was here to ruin my second child!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already said that she\u2019s intentionally going against me. She just doesn\u2019t want me to live a good life. She wants to torment us Ning family so that we\u2019ll never have a day of peace before she\u2019s satisfied!\u201d Zhuang Lingyu was getting more and more stirred up. Her mournful shouts echoed in the ward.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua\u2019s face seemed to tremble and at this moment, he looked extremely sorrowful too. \u201cThat brat wouldn\u2019t have such guts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu scoffed. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t? She\u2019s very capable now! And she knows so many ruffians from everywhere. Is there anything she wouldn\u2019t do? If she didn\u2019t have the guts, could Xueluo be treated so unjustly to the point that she\u2019s at today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo pretended that she was not willing to believe it. Her eyes teared up as she shook her head. \u201cNo, she won\u2019t\u2026 Sister wouldn\u2019t do such a thing. I know Sister hates me\u2026 I always knew that\u2026 but if she hates me, she can just come for me! I\u2019ll let her do whatever she wants!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why? Why did she have to put the hate onto Mother!? Mother, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong! In fact, you\u2019re her biological mother, and the one in you was her biological brother! How could she have done such a thing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s words seemed to be defending Ning Xi, yet every word solidified the suspicions in Zhuang Lingyu and Ning Yaohua\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo looked like she was in pain as she blamed herself. She wiped her tears away and stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault\u2026 if it weren\u2019t for me, Sister wouldn\u2019t have taken the wrong path\u2026 It\u2019s all my fault\u2026 I want to go look for her and talk it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>When they saw Ning Xueluo emotionally rushing out of the room, Ning Yaohua and Zhuang Lingyu were worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis child! Why is she so impulsive?! She\u2019s still pregnant too! Su Yan, quickly get Xueluo back!\u201d Ning Yaohua said anxiously.</p><br/><p>Su Yan nodded before he immediately rushed out of the ward to chase her.</p></div>\n</div>"}

I don\u2019t want to see any more problems!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she finished speaking, three knocks sounded from the door.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo immediately shot Chang Li a look filled with nervousness.</p><br/><p>Chang Li hurriedly hid the broken desk lamp and covered up the TV with a dust cover before going to open the door.</p><br/><p>Outside the ward, Su Yan looked at Chang Li with some surprise, finding it curious that she would appear at Ning Xueluo\u2019s ward at this hour, \u201cTalking business?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were some issues at work that I had to discuss with Chang-jie, we just finished talking. Yan-gege, why have you come this late at night?\u201d Ning Xueluo changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys continue talking, I\u2019m leaving first!\u201d Chang Li said her goodbyes and cast a look loaded with meaning at Ning Xueluo before leaving.</p><br/><p>Su Yan didn\u2019t notice their interactions. He pinched the bridge of his nose and looked particularly grave.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo noticed his expression and tried probing, \u201cIs it because of Ning Xi\u2019s matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo bit her lip as her body started trembling, \u201cYan-gege, are you blaming me? Blaming me for forcing Ning Xi to this point?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan sighed, \u201cYou, you like to let your imagination run wild. This was her fault in the first place, why would I blame you? I\u2019m only\u2026 blaming myself\u2026 I didn\u2019t handle all this properly back then, that\u2019s why she\u2019s in this kind of state now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that she would rather sell her body than come and apologise to me\u2026 Why does she hate me so much? What can I do to make her let go of her anger? Don\u2019t tell me that I really have to leave you to make her happy?\u201d Ning Xueluo\u2019s face was filled with agony at the thought.</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s expression immediately changed. With a severe expression, he said: \u201cXueluo, I forbid you from saying things like that. It wasn\u2019t easy for us to get together, are you really willing to give it all up just for a small matter like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo hurriedly nestled into his embrace with a terrified expresison, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019m just scared that you\u2019ll regret it, regret getting together with me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shock flitter across Su Yan\u2019s face before he told her in a firm tone: \u201cI\u2019ve never regretted it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two of them were speaking, a knock sounded on the door again.</p><br/><p>Su Yan went over to open the door and saw that it was Ning Yaohua and Zhuang Lingyu standing there. With some surprise, he greeted them: \u201cUncle, Auntie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, Mum\u2026 Has something happened?\u201d Ning Xueluo displayed astonishment on her face and hurriedly got off the bed to welcome them.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu pressed her back down on the bed gently, \u201cDon\u2019t move, you\u2019re still injured, just lie down properly. There\u2019s nothing wrong, we\u2019re just here to visit you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua\u2019s face was darkened: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Xueluo. I\u2019ve come here to tell you that I\u2019ll definitely seek justice for you. Even if I have to tie her up, I\u2019ll do it and bring her here to apologise to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Ning Xueluo\u2019s eyes were damp, \u201cThanks Dad, thanks Mum. Actually, I don\u2019t mind it at all. I only hope that Jiejie can find her way eventually. With how she\u2019s acting now, she\u2019s going to ruin her entire life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s expression turned extremely ugly, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that she would actually do something this shameless. What kind of bad karma did our Ning family accumulate to create a bastard like this! If I had known this earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have brought her back. It\u2019s fine we just have Xueluo, but the old man wouldn\u2019t listen! See what happened now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua looked impatient, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. Stop nagging! I\u2019ll handle this matter. Also, don\u2019t let the old man know about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was in the middle of a crucial period in the fight for the right of inheritance against his younger brother now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His pupils shrunk a little.</p><br/><p>After a while, the elder said, \u201cMs. Ning Xi, please sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded and sat down. Since she was unclear about his intention of inviting her over, she patiently waited for what he had to say. Besides, she was too nervous to say anything at all.</p><br/><p>He was a legend in Hollywood after all; he was someone who only existed within the realm of her imagination, and now he was right in front of her!</p><br/><p>His eyes looked sharp as if he could see right through a person\u2019s heart. However, the way he looked at Ning Xi at the moment was devoid of pressure. He said gently, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have invited you over in a rush, but I just saw your audition video.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, but the reason you want to see me is\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you can take up the role of Anna in the movie \u2018Assassin\u2019, Ms. Ning Xi,\u201d Jace said straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi imagined countless possible outcomes, but she was stunned when she heard it directly from Jace himself.</p><br/><p>Anna?</p><br/><p>Jace had invited her to take up the role of Anna!</p><br/><p>Anna was the female lead for this movie!</p><br/><p>Jace continued, \u201cBack then, my daughter Caroline was the scriptwriter and female lead for the movie \u2018Assassin\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was once again astonished when she heard this. Ms. Caroline, the legendary female lead of \u201cAssassin\u201d from Hollywood, was actually Jace\u2019s daughter!</p><br/><p>She had countless curious questions but did not dare to ask them.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, my daughter Caroline passed away due to sickness when she was traveling. It has been some time, which is why I wanted to remake the movie so as to commemorate my daughter.\u201d The elder\u2019s expression looked slightly depressed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was really surprised.</p><br/><p>When she saw the movie \u201cAssassin\u201d for the first time, she loved the character portrayed by Anna whom she thought was just the coolest.</p><br/><p>However, Caroline only starred in the movie \u201cAssassin\u201d and then vanished. There was no news about her whatsoever after that. She would never have expected that Caroline had already passed away.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Ning Xi found out about the story behind the movie \u201cAssassin\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy condolences.\u201d Ning Xi had no idea what else to say.</p><br/><p>The elder then asked, \u201cI\u2019m placing a lot of importance on this character, so I hope you can give it your all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Had he already decided on her to take up the role?</p><br/><p>With such a ginormous sweet pie falling from the sky, she was almost crushed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi asked, \u201cAs far as I know, the female lead was confirmed to be Ms. Lilian, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jace then replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not confirmed. It was just an initial shortlist. After our meeting today, I believe your aura and image suit the character very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you know that the settings for parts of the movie will be in China. Caroline\u2019s mother is Chinese, and she\u2019s been living here since she was a child. That was also the reason why parts of the movie were taken here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elder was then reminded of the past and stopped talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

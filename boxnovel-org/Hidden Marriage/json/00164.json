He patted her gently on the head with his large palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Tingxiao\u2026\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s response was a little slow as she looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, how do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was bewildered, \u201cIs this the hospital? What happened to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fainted yesterday with a fever of 39 degrees.\u201d Upon thinking back to how she had suddenly collapsed yesterday, Lu Tingxiao couldn\u2019t control his darkening expression.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head, \u201cI was having a fever? Why can\u2019t I feel any strength in my body now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat must be from hunger. You\u2019ve already slept for almost an entire day and night.\u201d Lu Tingxiao helped her to set up the meal table before bringing a pillow for her back, \u201cI guessed that you were about to wake up, so I bought you dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Ning Xi looked at the man busying himself with setting up things and pursed her lips. She couldn\u2019t resist reaching out to touch his chin.</p><br/><p>The warmth from her fingertips made Lu Tingxiao startle. His gaze was warm as he looked at the girl, \u201cHm? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s brows were furrowed together as she looked at his haggard appearance and the stubble on his chin, \u201cWere you taking care of me the whole night? Even your stubble has grown out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I slept for a bit.\u201d Actually, he hadn\u2019t closed his eyes for even a minute and hadn\u2019t had the mood to clean up. It wasn\u2019t until she had woken up that his heart had finally settled down.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat. It\u2019s not good for you to eat oily food right now, so I only got you some porridge. I\u2019ll buy something tastier when you get well.\u201d Lu Tingxiao passed the bowl of porridge and a spoon to her, \u201cDo you have the strength to eat? Do you need me to help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t make any sound or movement.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised his head to look at her in suspicion, \u201cIs something the matter? Does it hurt anywhere? I\u2019ll go call the doctor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hurriedly pulled him back, \u201cAy, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just not fully awake yet, I zoned out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao relaxed and said, \u201cWhat you need now is plenty of rest, don\u2019t let your thoughts run wild.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ning Xi nodded and focused on eating her porridge. However, she looked like she was miles away, like her mind had gone away on a journey.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was treating her so well that she was terrified.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like she hadn\u2019t noticed the way he treated her from the start. However, she had been ignoring it on purpose, and she even got used to it eventually.</p><br/><p>Everything that the man before her had done\u2026 was it really just for the sake of repaying the debt of gratitude?</p><br/><p>Even if he took her as a friend, who would go this far for their friends?</p><br/><p>There were just way too many things she needed to take care of, so that thought simply flashed through her mind and disappeared\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After her meal, Ning Xi finally regained some of her energy.</p><br/><p>She quickly banished the chaotic thoughts in her head and started to get down to business, \u201cLu Tingxiao, is my phone here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao showed his displeasure on his face, \u201cI just said that you need to get plenty of rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held her hands together in a begging gesture, \u201cI\u2019ve already rested enough by sleeping for so long, and I just ate my fill. If you don\u2019t let me do something now, mold will start growing on me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao saw that she did look much better, and he couldn\u2019t resist her puppy eyes, so he took out her phone and passed it to her.</p><br/><p>Following that, he brought over the thermometer. \u201cMeasure your temperature.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Ning Xi obediently opened up and held the thermometer in her mouth. She then opened a web page and started checking the latest entertainment news.</p><br/><p>However, when she saw the latest headlines\u2026</p><br/><p>Schemes Abound on the Set of\u300aLand Under Heaven\u300b, Femme Fatale Stops at Nothing to Rise in the Ranks</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s Injury, Was It an Accident or Was It a Planned Murder?</p><br/><p>Starlight Entertainment Upholds Their Boycott of Unfair Competition, Protecting the Right to Safety for Their Artistes</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s Office Has Issued a Lawyer\u2019s Letter, Ning Xi Disappeared from the Face of the Earth, No Response Thus Far</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

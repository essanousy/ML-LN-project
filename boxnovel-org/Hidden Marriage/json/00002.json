That night you drank the wine that I added a little something to, and out of good will, I found two brawny men for you so that you could fully satisfy your desire. Who knew that you would be so insensible? You actually entered some wild man\u2019s room, and even unceremoniously\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xueluo\u2019s tone was full of disgust: \u201cYan-gege is too kind-hearted, he was afraid that you wouldn\u2019t be able to accept the truth, so he said that it was him that night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was trembling with anger, listening up to here, she could no longer hold back and grabbed Ning Xueluo\u2019s wrist. \u201cWhy would you do that to me? Why! Haven\u2019t you harmed me enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo had her eyebrows raised in anger at first, and was about to push Ning Xi away, but she caught sight of Su Yan standing behind Ning Xi. She immediately softened her voice, showing off a delicate and pitiful expression: \u201cOlder sister, I know I was wrong. If you want to beat and scold someone, then do it towards me, don\u2019t blame Yan-gege\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi froze, and in the next second, she saw Ning Xueluo suddenly fall to the ground, that pose\u2026 was as if she had pushed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi! What did you do\u2014\u2014\u201d A scolding voice sounded from behind her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned in surprise, and saw Su Yan with a cold expression.</p><br/><p>Su Yan brushed past her, and supported Ning Xueluo up: \u201cXueluo, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was practically hanging her entire body on Su Yan: \u201cYan-gege, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose, I know I\u2019m in the wrong\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m the one who should be sorry to sister for causing all this\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, I\u2019ll settle everything!\u201d Su Yan patted Ning Xueluo\u2019s shoulders, letting her enter the car: \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything to Ning Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mind was completely blank, she watched Su Yan walk towards her, and watched his mouth open and close.</p><br/><p>He talked for a long time.</p><br/><p>He spoke of their time together as childhood sweethearts, of his struggle when he fell in love with Ning Xueluo, of his anger when he found out that Ning Xueluo had plotted against her, of his shock and guilt when he found out that Ning Xi was pregnant\u2026\u2026 He spoke of how he had accepted Ning Xueluo\u2019s apology\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, he said: \u201cNing Xi, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t marry you. It\u2019s not because of the matter of that night or this child, but it\u2019s because I can\u2019t let Xueluo down, and I don\u2019t want to deceive myself and my feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>These few months, he had been taking Ning Xueluo with him overseas, and after getting along together day and night, it was even harder to separate. Even though he had admitted that he was the one who had relations with Ning Xi that night for the sake of covering up her pain, in his heart, he had already chosen Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>So after knowing that Ning Xi was pregnant, he could not bear it any longer and immediately went to the Ning family to explain everything to their parents, and to reveal the truth to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u2026 Su Yan\u2026\u2026 you knew all along that it was Ning Xueluo who drugged me to ruin my innocence? For the sake of protecting her, you told me that it was you that night?\u201d The Ning Xi that had finally recovered her voice, looked at the cool and calm Su Yan as if her soul had escaped from her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, Xueluo did not do it on purpose, she\u2019s still young, and impulsive\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about me?\u201d Ning Xi raised her head to look at Su Yan, face full of despair: \u201cDid you ever think of me, not even for a little bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan did not speak, and after a long while, he reached out to Ning Xi: \u201cThe sun is too bright here, let\u2019s go home first\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me\u2014\u2014\u201d Ning Xi pushed away Su Yan\u2019s hands, and suddenly started laughing loudly.</p><br/><p>Living up to now, Ning Xi felt that her life was like a joke.</p><br/><p>In order to live in the same city as Su Yan, she had put all her strength in her studies so she could get into B University.</p><br/><p>In order to please Su Yan, she had given her dream of acting.</p><br/><p>In order to match his upbringing and family background, she had abandoned her adoptive parents to return to the Ning family, clumsily trying to please those so-called distinguished figures\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, what she received in return was one sentence: \u201cI can\u2019t let Xueluo down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo, had stolen not only her identity, and her biological parents, but now\u2026\u2026 she had even stolen away her sweetheart!</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was still young, so her mistakes could be forgiven?</p><br/><p>Then\u2014\u2014 who would take responsibility for her life?</p><br/><p>She even\u2014\u2014she didn\u2019t even know who the man from that night was!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi covered her face; body shaking fiercely, she was already in the depths of despair.</p><br/><p>Su Yan watched Ning Xi walk towards the road unthinkingly, as if in a trance. He threw away the cigarette he was grasping between his fingers, and was about to chase after her, but was held back by Ning Xueluo, who held onto his sleeve from behind: \u201cYan-gege, where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>And in the instant Su Yan was hesitating, a loud noise rang out. Ning Xi, who had been walking on the zebra crossing, was thrown into the air, landing heavily on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp\u2014\u2014 help\u2014\u2014 A pregnant woman was hit\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>In the glaring light, Ning Xi saw shaking silhouettes and the two faces that made her nauseous. The cramping pain that came from her belly caused her to lose consciousness bit by bit. She only blinked her eyes once, and the fresh blood on her forehead flowed into her eyes\u2026\u2026 The world fell into darkness\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

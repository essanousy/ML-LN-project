What did...Lu Tingxiao mean\u2026?</p><br/><p>\"What did Lu Tingxiao mean just now? Isn\u2019t that woman just the adopted daughter abandoned by the Ning family?\" Guan Rui frowned.</p><br/><p>\"It seems like she\u2019s not adopted, she\u2019s the biological daughter\u2026\" Guan Ziyao mumbled.</p><br/><p>Guan Rui sneered, \"Even if she\u2019s from the Ning family, she\u2019s nothing compared to you!\"</p><br/><p>\"But according to what Lu Tingxiao said, it seems like the woman has some other more prestigious identity...\"</p><br/><p>Guan Rui thought about it and assured, \"I\u2019ll investigate further later on, pay it no mind. That guy is still too young and he probably just wanted to irritate me plus oppose his family\u2019s arrangement! In the whole of Imperial, how many people are there that the Lu family is not worthy of? There\u2019s only a handful of them! And none of them could ever be related to Ning Xi!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The dinner continued harmoniously and most of the crowd focused on the elusive Little Master of the Lu family. Some people even secretly hoped that the child would embarrass himself out of their jealousy. To their chagrin, they were all disappointed as Little Treasure was really obedient after following Ning Xi. To everyone, there was no difference compared to a normal kid. His condition seemed to have stabilized after two years of treatment. If not, the Lu family would not have let him appear in public\u2026</p><br/><p>Aside from the Little Master of the Lu family, the other star of the night could only be the genius from the recently returned Guan family! As expected of a top student, he did not forget about his studies even during the dinner. He heard that some bright people were gathered here today, so he actually brought a few maths question that he was unable to solve. To his delight, some guests were interested and tried to solve the equations with him.</p><br/><p>\"Oh my gosh, is this really a middle school mathematics question? This is crazy! I pity students nowadays!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha, Mo Lingtian, you\u2019re just an underachiever! You don\u2019t even understand the questions. These are university-level questions, and they are at a competitive level!\" someone mocked Mo Lingtian.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian's mouth twitched. \"Ugh, fine...it\u2019s not the questions that are crazy, this top student from the Guan family is crazy!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah! I think I solved it! Is the answer to the first question -9?\" a young teen with glasses asked eagerly.</p><br/><p>Guan Zhichen replied expressionlessly as he shook his head, \"Nope, the answer is 0.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ugh...I\u2019m wrong again!\" The young teen was disappointed.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve worked out the solution already. I can teach you, but I can\u2019t solve the second question yet.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Elder Guan! Your grandson is amazing!\" A few guests were gawking at the group of brainiac kids, their eyes were full of envy.</p><br/><p>Lu Chongshan praised the boy as well, \"Like father, like son!\"</p><br/><p>Guan Rui shrugged helplessly. \"He\u2019s going to become a bookworm, I\u2019m really having a headache about it! I brought him here to help him relax, yet now he even brought his questions up when I was not noticing!\"</p><br/><p>\"Elder Guan, you should be glad! My kid at home would not even try to read even if I beat him up!\"</p><br/><p>\"Can your kid compare to Elder Guan\u2019s grandson? His IQ is 180 and he's already received several International Olympic Mathematics Awards at the age of ten\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

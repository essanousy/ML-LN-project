Unfortunately, she could not get a hold of any news on them.</p><br/><p>As for the world outside, the Lu Corporation did not topple amidst the storm. The foreign investments withdrew from the Chinese market one after another, and the economic crisis gradually dissipated.</p><br/><p>Not long after that, what shocked the entire business world was that the influential Yi Lan Innovative Investment Group had chosen to entirely withdraw from China\u2019s market at their prime.</p><br/><p>Half a year later.</p><br/><p>A large-scale case of drugs being smuggled across international borders was about to begin court session. What everyone paid the most attention to was the fact that one of the suspects was unexpectedly a former popular female star in the entertainment industry and Yifeng Corporation\u2019s young lady of the house, Ning Xueluo. Everyone kept crying out in disbelief.</p><br/><p>In a certain prison in the suburbs of Beijing.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo scoffed when she saw who had come. \u201cHuh, Su Yan! Forget it\u2026 There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll divorce you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan looked expressionlessly at this woman before him who was evil all over without any hint of tenderness from the past. \u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about the divorce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married, after all. I\u2019ve come to see you one last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo suddenly thought of something and her expression changed abruptly. \u201cCould it be that I\u2026 No way! I\u2019ll just be charged with hiding drugs at the most, plus about those illegal activities outside of the country\u2019s borders, I just threatened a few people and attempted murder by hiring a hitman. Even if I get several charges, I\u2019ll just be sentenced to 20 or 30 years. There will come the time when I see the day of light!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s voice did not have a hint of emotion. \u201cNot charging you for hiding the drugs, but illegal possession of drugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>The color drained from Ning Xueluo\u2019s face instantly. She said emotionally, \u201cIllegal posession of drugs? What illegal possession of drugs?! I was just helping someone else hide the drugs! The drugs aren\u2019t even mine! This is slander!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo finally panicked.</p><br/><p>If it was illegal possession of drugs, with the amount of drugs involved, it would be enough for her to be sentenced to death.</p><br/><p>No wonder Su Yan said he was not here to talk about divorcing her. Once she died, he would naturally be relieved of their marriage!</p><br/><p>She could not figure it out!</p><br/><p>No matter what, she could not figure out how the police had gotten hold of the evidence that she had hidden drugs, and how they knew everything she had done like the back of their hands, and with sufficient evidence.</p><br/><p>She knew that those people must have sold her out, yet she could not figure out why!</p><br/><p>Even if it were because those people were from abroad and their whereabouts were uncertain, even if they were exposed, the police in this country could not do anything, but hand the evidence over to the Chinese police, how did it benefit them?</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026 Ning Xi again!? Was it Ning Xi who had bribed them again?</p><br/><p>After Su Yan left, Ning Xueluo had demanded to meet her lawyer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I going to be sentenced to ten or twenty years this time? How confident are you?\u201d Ning Xueluo quickly asked.</p><br/><p>The lawyer\u2019s expression was a little vague. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When she saw her lawyer\u2019s expression, Ning Xueluo\u2019s blood turned cold. \u201cWhat is happening?! Tell me the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had evidence about the Su family\u2019s corruption, so why was Su Yan\u2019s tone earlier so fearless?</p><br/><p>The lawyer hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cMadam Su, forgive me but my hands are tied. The Su family has people up there. For your case, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you. It\u2019s best if you just expect the worst.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople up there? What kind of people would they have?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The lawyer cleared his throat. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard? I thought Mr. Su has already told you\u2026 Mr Su is going to marry the heiress of the Liang family from City S next month.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

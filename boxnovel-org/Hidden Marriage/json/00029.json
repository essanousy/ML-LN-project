They were even able to compete directly with the oldest, leading company in the industry, Starlight Entertainment.</p><br/><p>From this, you could see how fierce the competition was between the two companies, their employees- from artistes to managers to assistants, makeup artists and stylists- could never mix. If there were artistes from both companies present on the same set, there would definitely be some sparks flying.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at his watch, \u201cThe minivan is at the door, you can do your makeup and styling on the way there and you\u2019ll make it in time. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to go or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was so conflicted that her intestines started to hurt, but she still gritted her teeth, \u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Lu Tingxiao wasn\u2019t bothered about it, then she wouldn\u2019t care about it either!</p><br/><p>Seeing that Lu Tingxiao had followed along, she was surprised, \u201cYou\u2019re going too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else is going to drive? Little Treasure wants to stay a little longer with you as well.\u201d He was using that matter-of-fact tone again, as if whatever he said was truth and she was only asking silly questions.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure nodded vigorously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, all four of them got on the minivan, together with the stylist Arthur.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t even change out of his clothes, he continued driving in his casual homewear while Ning Xi and Arthur sat in the back, with Little Treasure watching them curiously as he sprawled over his seat.</p><br/><p>Arthur carefully looked over Ning Xi once, his gaze showing great appreciation, \u201cThis lady has perfect features and amazing skin, I don\u2019t need to do much. I\u2019ll just put on some light makeup. What occasion are you going to today, miss? I need to choose the right clothes for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, it\u2019s just an opening ceremony for a movie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was deathly afraid that she would get beaten up if he found out that she was from Starlight. Luckily, Arthur didn\u2019t ask much, he only nodded to show that he understood and continued to do her makeup.</p><br/><p>When they were close to the location of the opening ceremony, Ning Xi had been fully made up from top to toe, they had grasped the timing very well.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stopped the car, then turned to look at the woman behind, with his arm on the back of his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ning Xi asked, a little nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to get such a compliment from someone as taciturn as Lu Tingxiao. Furthermore, Little Treasure was tilting his head and looking at her with an awestruck expression.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was suddenly brimming with confidence and she hugged Little Treasure apologetically, \u201cDarling, I\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t keep my word, but auntie promises you that I\u2019ll quickly return to accompany you after work!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure hugged her for a moment before reluctantly letting go and waving goodbye, knowing that she was rushing for time.</p><br/><p>Looking at the pair of father and son behind her, Ning Xi\u2019s heart was filled with warmth\u2026</p><br/><p>After battling like a lone soldier for so long, it was the first time she had had such a warm feeling.</p><br/><p>Since Ning Xi had left, the driver\u2019s position was naturally left to Arthur.</p><br/><p>Arthur could no longer hold back his nosiness and carefully asked as he drove, \u201cBoss, who was that lady just now? Is she one of the new recruits of our company? How come I haven\u2019t seen her before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn! Their big boss actually had a woman at his side, this was mind blowing news!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao supported his chin, answering leisurely: \u201cAn artiste from Starlight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Arthur: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Arthur looked as sour as if he had eaten a lemon.</p><br/><p>Big boss! You actually let me style an artiste from Starlight!</p><br/><p>Why is our boss working for the other side!</p><br/><p>Even our second young master doesn\u2019t date anyone from Starlight, okay?</p><br/><p>If the person sitting here had been the second young master, he would have let loose a string of ranting.</p><br/><p>However, this was the great evil king Lu Tingxiao\u2026</p><br/><p>He could only hold it in, not even daring to let out a single peep of complaint even if it killed him.</p><br/><p>Something else that he couldn\u2019t say out was, that unknown Starlight artiste wasn\u2019t going to become their soon-to-be lady boss, right?</p><br/><p>After all, this woman was even able to win over the little prince.</p><br/><p>She definitely wasn\u2019t simple\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The early morning breeze was slightly chilly and blew comfortably across her face. Simultaneously, it dispersed the frustration that had built up over the past several days.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao turned on the radio and, immediately, the tones of light music drifted throughout the car\u2026</p><br/><p>Confession balloons blown to the street</p><br/><p>Flying and smiling in the sky</p><br/><p>You said you\u2019re rather hard to chase</p><br/><p>Wanted me to give up before it was too late</p><br/><p>You wouldn\u2019t let me choose the most expensive gifts</p><br/><p>All you wanted were the fallen leaves from the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es</p><br/><p>Oh~ Planning a romantic date</p><br/><p>Unafraid to ruin everything</p><br/><p>Having you is like having the entire world</p><br/><p>My dear, from that day I started loving you, happiness came so easily</p><br/><p>My dear, don\u2019t be headstrong</p><br/><p>Your eyes are saying \u2018I\u2019m willing\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This song\u2019s melody was very sweet and it carried a bright and lively summertime vibe. However, when Ning Xi heard it, she kept thinking that something was off.</p><br/><p>They had clearly only come out to buy groceries. Why did it seem like a date?</p><br/><p>Also, these lyrics\u2026 For some reason, hearing them made her feel a little self-conscious!</p><br/><p>After half an hour passed in this ambiguous atmosphere, they finally arrived at the wet market.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to buy a mask for you?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked, feeling a little worried. In order to avoid being disturbed, he hadn\u2019t let the bodyguards follow them this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, no need. The workers who come here don\u2019t have enough time to be concerned about gossip. Plus, I look like such a virtuous lady today. I\u2019m sure that no one will be able to recognize me. The way I see it, it\u2019s you and Little Treasure who need the masks!\u201d Ning Xi joked.</p><br/><p>Even though it was still very early, there were already many people inside the wet market. People were hustling and bustling in and out of the market.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was worried that Little Treasure would feel uncomfortable so she bent over and picked him up.</p><br/><p>It was Little Treasure\u2019s first time coming to this sort of place. He looked at everything he could along the way. His little head switched between her shoulders, leaning on her left shoulder then her right as he observed with extreme concentration.</p><br/><p>However, the little bun had recently gained more weight and was actually a little heavy. After carrying him for a while, Ning Xi grew more tired.</p><br/><p>Seeing this from the side, Lu Tingxiao promptly took the little bun from her hands, \u201cLet me hold him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun\u2019s body was already in Lu Tingxiao\u2019s grasp, but his hands were still wrapped firmly around Ning Xi\u2019s neck, refusing to let go.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression turned grave, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that you\u2019re really heavy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing those words, the little bun looked like he had been dealt a blow, as if he was a girl who had just been called fat.</p><br/><p>Even though Ning Xi felt that this was pretty funny, she still hurriedly tried to comfort him, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to your dad\u2019s nonsense. You\u2019re not heavy at all. You could even gain a little more weight. However, you\u2019ll be more stable in your dad\u2019s arms and he\u2019s rather tall so you\u2019ll get a better view if he holds you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was consoled somehow but he wasn\u2019t in the mood to look at the scenery any more. He stared unwaveringly at Ning Xi the entire way, afraid that he would lose her in the crowd. Whenever he saw that the distance between them had increased too much, he would reach out towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, the fish over there looks really fresh!\u201d Ning Xi hustled over to the front of a booth like a mudfish.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao glanced at the girl, then he freed up one of his hands and picked her hand up.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Ning Xi blanked out and subconsciously looked at the hand that had been grasped. Her palm felt extremely warm.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure is really worried that you\u2019ll get lost.\u201d Lu Tingxiao looked as if he had had no other choice than to hold her hand.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at Little Treasure and realised that the little guy\u2019s face was filled with anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey ma\u2019am, do you still want this fish?\u201d At this time, the fishmonger auntie asked from the side.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hastily spoke, \u201cYes, yes, I do. I\u2019ve already walked one circle around this market and the fish you have here are the freshest, Auntie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, you have really good eyes. Just ask around. Everyone knows that I have the best fish in the entire marketplace!\u201d The auntie beamed with pride.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi only realised that something was off after listening for quite a while. This auntie had just called her ma\u2019am?</p><br/><p>She had clearly mistaken them for a family of three\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

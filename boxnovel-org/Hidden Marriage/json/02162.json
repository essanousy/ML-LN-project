Why aren\u2019t you sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed and dangled her arms around the man\u2019s neck. She rubbed her forehead against his. \u201cYou were fighting a bloody war outside. How could I be sleeping!? Of course, I\u2019m going to wait for your triumphant return!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s heart melted and he laughed as well. \u201cThank you for your hard work!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I really did wait long!\u201d Ning Xi accepted the praise shamelessly, then she asked curiously, \u201cBased on my understanding of Third Senior Sister, she surely used Annie for the last level, didn\u2019t she? And Han Xiao would never help you guys! How did you guys pass the last level? I thought I\u2019d have to wait until midnight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have Little Treasure,\u201d replied Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure?\u201d Ning Xi was dumbfounded for a moment, then she grinned. \u201cLittle Treasure sure is amazing! Annie can never resist his cute little face! Good job!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao gently touched the girl\u2019s hair, then he took his coat off. \u201cGo to sleep earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly grabbed the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDarling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao turned over. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at him. \u201cWhat? Tonight is our wedding night! It\u2019s time for a priceless memory!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression darkened when he saw the girl\u2019s flirtatious expression. Glancing at her in her bright red pajamas, he took a deep breath and averted his eyes away. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember we\u2019ve set three rules?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked unhappy. \u201cFirst rule, don\u2019t do anything dangerous. Second rule, don\u2019t eat anything I shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she reached the last one, Ning Xi\u2019s expression was sour. \u201cThird rule, I can\u2019t flirt with you! Hey! Not even on our wedding night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression did not waver. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi crossed her arms across her chest. \u201cGod, how could you place such a vision beside me when I can\u2019t do anything? How cruel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled and he looked very tempting at the moment.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was enraged. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?! Why can\u2019t I flirt with you but you can flirt with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d The man laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did and you\u2019re doing it again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at his wife\u2019s cute little face. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi snuggled into Lu Tingxiao\u2019s arms. \u201cDarling, would you like a boy or girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll like it as long as it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled. \u201cI love to make babies for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pinched between his eyebrows. \u201cRule number three!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do now?!\u201d Ning Xi felt so wronged.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao, of course, knew what was she thinking about. \u201cBe good, at least after these few days. You\u2019re too tired today and need a lot of rest, and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao took a pause, then he looked at the girl passionately. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I might lose control tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s words were the biggest praise to her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was delighted. \u201cAlright, alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>A certain someone was getting better and better at flirting. He even dealt perfectly with a pregnant lady like Ning Xi, so she stopped making a fuss and went to sleep peacefully.</p></div>\n</div>"}

She did not expect that he would be directly calling her back, which startled her.</p><br/><p>So Ning Xi told Xiao Tao to excuse her and quickly found an empty corner and answered the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw your message.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s tone was calm, as if he was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi dug her nails in the wall tiles distractedly and replied, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she had sent that message, she felt nothing, but at the moment why does she feels that something was off?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s low and husky voice came over the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough\u2026\u2026\u201d When Ning Xi heard these three words, a stunned cough burst out of her, and she angrily replied, \u201cWho is jealous! I think it is necessary to find out the company\u2019s relationships so I casually asked! It\u2019s nothing more than that!\u201d</p><br/><p>F***! No wonder she felt something was off! Sure enough, that question make other people feel as if she was jealous ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it was casually asked, then I refuse to answer,\u201d Lu Ting Xiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026\u2026?\u201d Ning Xi was astonished. She never would have thought that Lu Ting Xiao would be so childish. \u201cWhat do I have to do for you to tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cRemember the question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Which question? Am I jealous?</p><br/><p>In fact\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Tao\u2019s ambiguous guesses about Lu Ting Xiao being together with another woman really made her heart a bit uncomfortable\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>But how could she admit it ah?</p><br/><p>Thus Ning Xi indifferently said, \u201cForget it if you don\u2019t want to answer. Since you\u2019ve had a relationship with Su Yi Mo, with just this reason, I\u2019ll minus your points and it will directly drop back to zero points!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao sighed, could not help but compromise, \u201cRest assured that there is no relationship. You do not have to be cautious about her in the company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do some people say that Su Yi Mo\u2019s backer is you? All the resources that was given to her before, wasn\u2019t that your order?\u201d Ning Xi asked puzzledly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am your personal backer.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao answered.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s face turned hot immediately, and she said in a serious tone, \u201cSpeak properly! You\u2019re not allowed to tease me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao chuckled, \u201cHeh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to laugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao finally decided not to tease her, lightly coughed and replied, \u201cIndeed it was my order, but I\u2019m innocent. The reason why i gave that order was because she saved Little Treasure\u2019s life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What happened to Little Treasure?\u201d Ning Xi immediately asked nervously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to allow Little Treasure to have contact with more people, I tried to send him to school. The result was that his emotions went wild and he ran out to the street. He was almost hit by a car but fortunately another car suddenly rushed out and hit that car, saving Little Treasure\u2019s life. It was later revealed that the person in the car was Su Yi Mo. Because she was driving under the influence of alcohol, she lost control, but against all odds it saved Little Treasure\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi heard this, she was stupefied, \u201cWhat! I don\u2019t know what to say! That was it Su Yi Mo who had good luck or Little Treasure who had good luck? So in order to repay her, you gave that order?\u201d</p><br/><p>But she was able to understand Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s method of repayment. Since Su Yi Mo had saved Little Treasure, even if it wasn\u2019t intentional but an accident, in the end, she had still saved Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, but people have really saved Little Treasure\u2019s life! Why didn\u2019t you offer your body for marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao replied in a deadly tone, his words basically killing her: \u201cDo you think I offer my body for marriage to just anyone?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I promise I\u2019ll never lie to you again!\"</p><br/><p>It was only at this moment he started to remind himself of what Ming Fangfang had done for him all along. Aside from not bearing a child for him, she was beautiful and generous, she never complained about being by his side, she took care of his daily lifestyle habits, and most importantly, she was extremely helpful in his business\u2026</p><br/><p>No! He could not afford to divorce Ming Fangfang now!</p><br/><p>\"Dear, this is the last time, I swear!\"</p><br/><p>Ming Fangfang did not trust him blindly this time.

Okay, then tell me, why are you trying to protect that woman?\"</p><br/><p>Ming Fangfang was forcing an answer out of him.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026\" Hu Hongda panicked even more, sweat trickling down his face. \"I was just seduced by that woman and was unable to think rationally in the thick of the moment!\"</p><br/><p>Ming Fangfang lost her final spark of hope she had in this man. \"Lies...all you did was lie to me!

How dare you?!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"If you wanted a child this badly, why didn\u2019t you just divorce me and find someone who could bear your child? If you were to tell me straight away, I would have agreed instantly.

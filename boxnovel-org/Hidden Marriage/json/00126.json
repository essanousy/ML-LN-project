She greeted the little bun as usual, \u201cHey, good morning darling!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the little bun refused to acknowledge her. He even turned his face to one side in an arrogant, yet adorable manner.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao, who was currently sitting at the dining table and reading the newspaper, raised an eyebrow in surprise upon seeing the situation. He tossed a puzzled gaze at Ning Xi, \u201cThe two of you are fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>How rare.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rubbed her nose, \u201cLittle Treasure was trying to persuade me to quit drinking just now. After I told him that there were also many benefits in drinking alcohol, he got angry at me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was what had happened. Lu Tingxiao nodded in understanding.</p><br/><p>The cogs in Ning Xi\u2019s head turned before she immediately requested an alliance, \u201cLu Tingxiao, could you help me talk to Little Treasure? Aren\u2019t there plenty of benefits in drinking alcohol as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Lu Tingxiao also had to drink at social gatherings, she thought that he would stand on her side for sure.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao turned to his right and looked at Ning Xi whose expression was full of expectation. He then turned to his left to look at his son, who was clearly indignant. He held a fist up to his mouth and coughed lightly, \u201cThere are indeed benefits to drinking\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately slapped her thigh in excitement, \u201cLittle Bun, see, I was right!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun immediately tossed a look of contempt at his dear dad. He had clearly been the one to suggest it last night, but now he had changed sides from just a single plea by Auntie Xiao Xi.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t stick to his principles!</p><br/><p>Realising that his son was looking at him like a traitor, Lu Tingxiao lost his smile and continued speaking, \u201cHowever, the harm of drinking alcohol far outweighs the benefits. Furthermore, you have to drink an appropriate amount to reap the benefits mentioned. Thus, unless you really can\u2019t avoid it, it would be best to drink as little as you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said so, he added on, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to quit drinking recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he finished speaking, Ning Xi immediately sprawled on the table listlessly, \u201cBig Boss, what happened to our alliance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, she had finally accepted the fact that the big bun and the little bun were allied against her. She raised her hand to indicate her surrender and said, \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll try to drink less if I can in the future. I won\u2019t boast about my capacity for liquor, I won\u2019t compete in drinking with others, and I\u2019ll make sure I can stop once I start drinking! Can you forgive me now, darling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure examined her expression, and only nodded after determining that she was being sincere. He reached out his chubby little hand and patted her head lightly, the same way she usually did when she was praising him, as if saying that she was a good child.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi really didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Other than that, her heart was filled with the warmth of the care and concern she felt from them. She picked up the little bun and kissed him, \u201cDarling, you\u2019re so cute even when you\u2019re angry. I\u2019m loving you even more every single day, what should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure\u2019s eyes lit up, he was very happy.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao, who had to face loving scenes like this almost everyday: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His son only had to act cute to get what he wanted. However, he had to think through his every move carefully to navigate through many trials\u2026</p><br/><p>At the chairman\u2019s office in Crown Real Estate.</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiangcheng\u2019s fierce-looking face trembled as he stood up, slamming his palm on the table, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! We\u2019ve always done things this way and we\u2019ve never seen any complaints from the Lu Corporation about it. Why do they have issues this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager\u2019s face was filled with anxiety, \u201cThere have been changes within the Lu Corporation\u2019s internal departments recently, so they\u2019ve gotten more strict on quality control. We have to see what the Lu Corporation has to say about this matter. If they close one eye regarding this matter, then we\u2019ll pass. If they\u2019re going to get serious about it, then it\u2019s ultimately a problem with our quality, and we\u2019re the ones who violated the contract\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiangcheng paced back and forth violently, \u201cThen what can we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRumour has it that it was Lu Tingxiao who personally sent the order to reject the agreement, so we can only try solve this by approaching him\u2026\u201d The manager muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Zhu Xiangcheng\u2019s mood became even more irritable, \u201cNothing works on Lu Tingxiao! He won\u2019t be moved by force, persuasion, bribes or women\u2026 It\u2019s just a dead end if we try to solve this by approaching him! No\u2026 wait\u2026 if it\u2019s women\u2026 maybe there\u2019s one person who can do it\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

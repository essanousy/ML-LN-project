I just want to be with you and Little Treasure now.\"</p><br/><p>If it were in the past, she would have regretted it if she were to retire from the peak of her career, but after returning from death's door, she understood what were the most important things in her life.</p><br/><p>The man kissed the girl's forehead tenderly. \"Little Treasure and I will always support you no matter what decision you make.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's body required more rest right now, and returning to her former state was impossible to accomplish in such a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>He was worried that Ning Xi might not be able to accept the fact that everyone had forgotten her after she woke up.</p><br/><p>He did not expect the girl to surprise him once again.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, Little Treasure is coming back soon, isn't he? Let's go pick him up!\" Ning Xi looked at the time and exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, let's go and pick Little Treasure up.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait, let me change my clothes first!

He was holding a square box in his hands.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's tears started falling the moment she saw the little guy. \"Little Treasure has gotten taller\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, 6 cm taller.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

By being decisive and buying them all, then one need not be burdened by having to just choose one.</p><br/><p>There was a retro-themed dress with Chinese elements that Ning Xi loved it the most. She had the salesperson pack up her clothes and she immediately wore that outfit.</p><br/><p>The salesperson was glad that she got herself a big deal, so with a big smile she said, \"Thank you for your patronage, please come again!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held onto all her bags and was stepping out when she saw a big group of celebrities entering the shop with Li Yueling as the lead. The woman in a long mint green dress beside Li Yueling was Ning Xueluo\u2026</p><br/><p>She did not see Ning Xueluo at the Noble audition the other day, so why was she here?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, every salesperson in the shop and the manager went up to them, bowing to Ning Xueluo, \"Welcome back, Mistress!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi frowned a little. Mistress?</p><br/><p>Because Ning Xi was on her way out, all of them saw her at the entrance.</p><br/><p>Li Yueling saw Ning Xi holding all the bags and said, \"I didn\u2019t expect that you'd like History too.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo went up to Ning Xi, \"Ning Xi, I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019ll be here. You could\u2019ve let me know beforehand so that I could have them give you a discount!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s brows frowned even more. Was it Ning Xueluo who bought over Neon?</p><br/><p>As far as she knew, Ning Xueluo usually liked European styles and had always thought that brands with Chinese element like Neon were too tacky, so why would she suddenly invest in Neon?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi just mumbled something and left the shop.</p><br/><p>Li Yueling sneered with despise, \"Even if she wore a dragon robe, it can\u2019t cover up her countryside stink!!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why do you say so?\" one of the artistes asked.</p><br/><p>Li Yueling raised her brows, \"Didn\u2019t you guys know that just like Fang Xiaowen, she came from a fairly remote village where people reared cows, goats, and poultry!\"</p><br/><p>All the artistes were surprised. \"I can\u2019t believe this. Has Director Cook gone crazy? Having someone like her to endorse the renowned Noble famous for its elegance?! If consumers knew that the ambassador was a countryside girl, who\u2019d still buy their products?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, I don\u2019t think Cook is crazy. He was just totally charmed by her!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo tried to settle them down. \"Okay, we\u2019re here to shop, let\u2019s stop talking about business!\"</p><br/><p>\"Right, Xueluo, is it really true that we can get the designer to design a dress for each and every one of us?\" an artiste asked with excitement.</p><br/><p>Li Yueling answered happily, \"Of course, Xueluo owns History, so it\u2019s no big deal!\"</p><br/><p>Most people there were fairly influential and no matter how popular History was, it was nothing more than a wardrobe addition. Ning Xueluo opened up again, \"I\u2019m really glad that all of you pretty ladies here are willing to wear dresses from History. It\u2019s our honor and it\u2019ll surely save me tons of advertising fees!\"</p><br/><p>The artistes were in a much better mood now and one of the popular ones replied, \"You\u2019re too generous, Xueluo, it\u2019s true that you've got a genuinely fantastic brand!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

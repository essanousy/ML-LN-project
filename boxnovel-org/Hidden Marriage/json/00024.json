It took Ning Xi a long time to digest it all.</p><br/><p>She looked at the little bun sticking closely to her side, \u201cLittle Treasure, did you break all those things just because you wanted to see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure nodded.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi frowned, \u201cDid you know it\u2019s wrong to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure shook his head.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally realised why Lu Tingxiao was so strict. This child was most likely overly spoiled at home and thought that it was a matter of course that everything should follow his will.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s gaze turned stern, \u201cThen auntie is going to tell you. What you did was wrong, that\u2019s what bad children do. You can\u2019t do that anymore, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure nodded.</p><br/><p>It was hard to describe the expression on Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Although Little Treasure was unruly, he would keep to his word as long as he had agreed to something.</p><br/><p>The psychiatrist had tried all sorts of methods to cure Little Treasure\u2019s bad habits. Habits such as hunger strikes, locking himself up and even destruction to get his way. However, Little Treasure had never given in.</p><br/><p>The two elders were too soft-hearted to try more forceful methods. They had only persisted halfway before giving up and following his will every time Little Treasure had thrown a tantrum.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s impact on Little Treasure was greater than he had imagined. Of course, he was happy regarding this point.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi then tried to coax him to sleep after she had finished setting down rules for him. In a soft tone, \u201cUh, how about a new song for today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure obediently nodded his head.</p><br/><p>She coughed several times, \u201clet me think of what to sing\u2026Right! Huluwa huluwa, seven flowers grow on a branch, not afraid even in a storm, la la la la la\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had been leaning against the door and almost fell, \u201cHow could Little Treasure like such childish songs with his level of intelligence!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then found out that the little guy was listening blissfully. Even funnier was that his dear brother was also listening blissfully\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stretched after finally coaxing Little Treasure to sleep, \u201cI\u2019m almost done singing all the children\u2019s songs I\u2019ve learned in my lifetime\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was dumbfounded, \u201cWhy do you have to sing children\u2019s songs? It\u2019s fine if you sing something else! All these children\u2019s songs are killing me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi used the rubber band on her wrist to tie up her hair casually. Her bright phoenix eyes raised slightly, \u201cOther songs? Other than children\u2019s songs, all the songs I know aren\u2019t appropriate for children!\u201d</p><br/><p>The memory of her singing under the moonlight appeared in Lu Tingxiao\u2019s mind after she had finished speaking\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was excited upon hearing that, \u201cHahaha, really, really? Which songs? Sing a few for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao casually tossed a glance over.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli immediately stood up straight out of fright. His brother was too petty!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were nearby just now?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>Otherwise how could she have reached this quickly?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was in my apartment. I sped over here on the motorbike! Fast, right?\u201d Ning Xi was proud.</p><br/><p>No wonder she was dressed like this.</p><br/><p>Her outfit was even more stunning than yesterday. She had seemed like a conservative little fairy yesterday, but now she was like a wild and free demoness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face was full of disapproval. He turned his cold gaze towards Lu Jingli, who had been the one to call Ning Xi of his own accord.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m good at riding!\u201d Ning Xi waved her hands nonchalantly. She then yawned, \u201cI\u2019ll make a move first since Little Treasure is fine now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao suddenly spoke up as she was preparing to leave, \u201cMiss Ning, I have a presumptuous request.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she had already expended her rage, Ning Xi immediately returned to her normal self. She respectfully said, \u201cMr Lu, please feel free to make your request. I\u2019ll try to comply as long as it\u2019s within my abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lu family also held an authoritative power in the underground. Demon King Lu was someone who would strike with just one disagreeable word.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at his son lying in his room with a solemn expression, \u201cLittle Treasure has been affected a lot more than I had imagined. He was accidentally locked in the storeroom at the bar last time. I hope that Miss Ning can move in with us to stay for a period of time since it\u2019s only you that can calm him down now. Only until Little Treasure\u2019s emotional state has recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned after hearing Lu Tingxiao\u2019s words, \u201cHah\u2026? Move in here\u2026to stay?\u201d</p><br/><p>TL Note: The chapter title is from the theme song from a Chinese children\u2019s cartoon, Calabash Brothers. Huluwa = calabash baby. XD</p><br/>\n</div>"}

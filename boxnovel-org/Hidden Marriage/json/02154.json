The only one that requires traveling overseas is the new product launch for LG in America\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boss then spoke up, \u201cTell them to come to China.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao gulped, \u201cUhh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheng Feng,\u201d called Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Cheng Feng replied, \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll contact them. After all, LG is a partner of the Lu Corporation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAny more problems?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao shook his head. \u201cNope!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected of the Boss!</p><br/><p>Xu Tao flipped through the schedule. \u201cNext up is the premiere event for \u2018Assassin\u2019. We have to go. Although there might be a lot of people on that day, the security will surely be tight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClear my schedule on that day,\u201d Lu Tingxiao told Cheng Feng.</p><br/><p><em>\u201d </em>Yes!\u201d Cheng Feng quickly noted it down in his notebook.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was speechless.</p><br/><p><em>Boss, if you were to go on that day, the situation would only become worse!</em></p><br/><p>Moving on, Xu Tao reported all of Ning Xi\u2019s upcoming work, and Lu Tingxiao cleared his schedule accordingly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wanted to say something at first, but in the end, she gave up.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt a little sleepy after a long discussion, she yawned.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao halted the discussion. \u201cSleepy? Go and take a nap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rubbed her eyes. \u201cBut I still have a meeting to attend to later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao nodded. \u201cBoss, there is indeed a meeting later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao went up to Ning Xi. \u201cGo to sleep. I\u2019ll attend the meeting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed. \u201cHow are you going to attend the meeting for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there any rule that family can\u2019t represent you in a meeting?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, not really\u2026\u201d Xu Tao replied.</p><br/><p><em>Even if there were such a rule, you are the Boss. Would there be anyone to tell you off?</em></p><br/><p>Xu Tao felt exhausted. Just as he was about to complain about it on the company group chat, he realized that everyone had their fair share.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao really represented Ning Xi at the meeting.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli and Jiang Muye were speechless when they saw the group chat.</p><br/><p>Again!</p><br/><p>In the end, Lu Jingli\u2019s plan to run away from home failed. To add salt to the wound, his mother made him decorate the wedding venue.</p><br/><p>As for a certain blondie, he could avoid the preparation at first, but he could never avoid the real deal after all.</p><br/><p>He still needed to be back and attend the wedding.</p><br/><p>To avoid any external disturbances, Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao organized their wedding on a small island that he owned.</p><br/><p>There was a fantasy-like church on the island which was designed by Lu Tingxiao. Built two years ago, the whole island was shrouded with the aura of love.</p><br/><p>Anyone could see that the island was made just for their wedding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everything ready? Wait! Not this earring. This is for the toast. Where\u2019s the pearl one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here! I\u2019m busy at the moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer and Ning Tianxin had been busy helping Ning Xi since 5 a.m. in the morning. While most matters were prepared beforehand, things still went a little out of hand on the day itself.</p><br/><p>In addition to Ning Xi being pregnant now, they needed to take extra precaution.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao came in through the door in his wedding suit. He wore a classic groom\u2019s breastpin on his chest and he looked very eye-catching.</p></div>\n</div>"}

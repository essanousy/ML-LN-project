He stared at the pair of lovebirds, having lost the ability to think.</p><br/><p>As for Ning Xueluo, who lay on the bed, she remained silent the whole time.</p><br/><p>She looked at Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi holding hands, then she noticed the ring around Ning Xi\u2019s neck which she had not noticed before. She saw how Lu Tingxiao was greeting the elder politely, and how Lu Jingli was striking a conversation with Ning Qiutong. The poison known as jealousy had now spread through her whole body and corroded all her internal organs\u2026</p><br/><p><em>How is that possible?</em></p><br/><p><em>How is that possible!?</em></p><br/><p><em>The person Ning Xi is married </em>to <em>\u2026 is Lu Tingxiao!</em></p><br/><p><em>Lu Tingxiao!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master, I\u2026 I\u2019m Ning Yaohua, Xiao Xi\u2019s father! We\u2019ve met each other before. The last time, you came to pick Xiao Xi up!\u201d Ning Yaohua quickly grabbed this chance as he thought that Lu Jingli was easier to speak to.</p><br/><p>Damn it, no wonder Lu Jingli came to pick Ning Xi up personally during the dinner last time!</p><br/><p>He thought that Ning Xi had something with Lu Jingli, but he never expected it not to be Lu Jingli, but Lu Tingxiao instead!</p><br/><p>He was so penitent that he almost wanted to smash his head into a wall.</p><br/><p>Ning Qiutong looked at Ning Yaohua as she laughed coldly. \u201cYou always think that your treasured fake daughter got married into a good family and have always boasted about i. Are you regretting now that Xiao Xi got married into an even better family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua calmed himself down. \u201cWhat is there to regret about? Xiao Xi got into a good family, so I\u2019m happy for her as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Qiutong chortled out loud. \u201cI wonder who insisted on calling the police just now, and even said that no one would affect his decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu could not hold it in anymore. \u201cShe did something so wicked. Are we really at fault here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She then looked at Lu Tingxiao. \u201cCEO Lu, no matter how powerful your family is, you can\u2019t just ignore the law. It remains a fact that Ning Xi took two lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Ning Xueluo clenched her stomach and groaned.</p><br/><p>Everyone shifted their attention back to Ning Xueluo and surrounded her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Xueluo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy stomach\u2026 It hurts\u2026\u201d Ning Xueluo appeared pale and exhausted just like a wilting flower, gaining sympathy from everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe poison is too strong. The doctor mentioned it\u2019ll be painful. Hold on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow miserable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd\u2019s gaze towards Ning Xi changed slowly when they saw Ning Xueluo\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was having such a good life, yet she had made Ning Xueluo suffer, and now she even started bullying her just because she married Lu Tingxiao. This was too much.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu went beside the bed, full of worry and pain.</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun then said, \u201cCEO Lu, I\u2019m afraid that you don\u2019t know it yet. This woman is really wicked. She harmed the child of her own mother and even poisoned the offspring of our Su family all just because of a tiny conflict! She\u2019s not worthy of marrying into the Lu family! What a humiliation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s face was filled with despair, yet in the dark, she was staring at Ning Xi\u2019s direction with the evil eye.</p><br/><p><em>Great\u2026 Just great, Ning Xi! I will make you lose everything. I will have you taste the feeling of falling into the pits of hell from the peaks of heaven!</em></p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not even look at the people around him. He just focused on his wife. \u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s not worthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun thought Lu Tingxiao was going to consider her words, but in the next moment, Lu Tingxiao continued, \u201cThe Lu family and I aren\u2019t worthy of Xiao Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli knew this would happen.</p></div>\n</div>"}

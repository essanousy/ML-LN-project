Trying to explain things to an idiot was absolutely the stupidest thing he could do.</p><br/><p>The company had invested a lot into Jia Qingqing, but there was no way to recover from the incident this time. No matter how massive the losses were, they could only give up on recovering them.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Feng Haoyang was already decided, Jia Qingqing hurriedly pounced towards Ning Xueluo like she was grasping for life, \u201cXueluo-jie, you have to help me, let Chang-jie manage me! I guarantee that I\u2019ll be obedient! I promise that I\u2019ll post an apology!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing so, Chang Li\u2019s expression immediately turned to horror. Letting her manage Jia Qingqing? Ning Xueluo wouldn\u2019t do that, would she?</p><br/><p>Of course, Ning Xueluo couldn\u2019t possibly be as braindead as Jia Qingqing. With a troubled expression, she lamented, \u201cQingqing, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help you, but you heard what Ning Xi said just now. She\u2019s not willing to help. This is also the company\u2019s decision, so I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once this matter had blown up, she knew that Jia Qingqing was done for. However, she had wanted to use her to drag Ning Xi down to the very end. It was a pity that Feng Haoyang had already seen that apologies wouldn\u2019t do anything at this point and might even drag another actress down, so he had finally decided to give up on Jia Qingqing.</p><br/><p>She had thought that Jia Qingqing was a great weapon to use against Ning Xi. Who knew that she would be so stupid as to fall and even boost Ning Xi up along the way? How could she possibly waste any effort on someone like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi! You bitch! Just you wait, even if I die, I\u2019m dragging you down with me!\u201d Jia Qingqing finally turned to despair. She tried to vent her anger on Ning Xi, but Feng Haoyang called security and she was finally dragged out.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t even want to waste any energy hating this kind of person. She only had some sympathy for her. She didn\u2019t even know she had been used as cannon fodder up till now.</p><br/><p>Feng Haoyang looked towards Ning Xi and his expression warmed up, \u201cNing Xi, just focus on doing well in your current movie. If the results are good, the company will focus more efforts on raising you. However, Xueluo\u2019s words made sense. Keep a low profile and don\u2019t cause any unneeded trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the initial outburst of slander on Ning Xi to the final clearing of her innocence, with the result of forcing Jia Qingqing into retirement, the entie sequence of events seemed like a perfectly executed PR plan.</p><br/><p>Although Feng Haoyang suspected that there was someone behind the scenes, he couldn\u2019t find any cracks, so he could only assume that Ning Xi had great luck.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Director Feng, I will.\u201d Ning Xi had pleasant surprise and fear written all over her face.</p><br/><p>After leaving the meeting room, Ning Xi went to the restroom and Ning Xueluo hurriedly followed after.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo crossed her arms over her chest and looked at her mockingly, \u201cNing Xi, by digging out other people\u2019s skeletons, aren\u2019t you afraid your own skeletons will be dug out of the closet by someone else someday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a cold glint. She immediately turned around and said indifferently, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t have a few skeletons around in this industry? Don\u2019t you have them too? Miss Ning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi purposely emphasised the surname \u2018Ning\u2019, then pretended to have suddenly realised something, \u201cAh! Speaking of which, doesn\u2019t Jia Qingqing\u2019s \u2018mistress masquerading as fake rich heiress\u2019 title suit you a lot? When the time comes for me to expose you, aren\u2019t you saving me the trouble of thinking up a headline?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as if Ning Xueluo\u2019s weak point had been stabbed. She immediately said in rage, \u201cWhat \u2018mistress masquerading as fake rich heiress\u2019! I\u2019ve been in the Ning family since birth and I\u2019m the only daughter that Father acknowledges! As for Su Yan, you failed to prevent his heart from wavering, do you think anyone will believe your nonsense?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi dragged out her words, \u201cThen\u2026 shall we try it out? Why don\u2019t I reveal my skeletons as well! There are so many people out there, the whereabouts of the two men you bribed are still unknown. Maybe I\u2019ll have better luck searching for them publicly?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She seemed to have just come over from an event.</p><br/><p>The arrogant sharp-chinned assistant had fear flitting across her face. \u201cI meant Qin Shuang, not you, Ms. Ning!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ning Xi did not look at the assistant, but glanced at Qin Shuang and asked.</p><br/><p>Qin Shuang explained, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Bro Xi. We just went into the wrong room, so they want us to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant felt righteous and interrupted. \u201cWent into the wrong room? The two of them are here to take the dressing room by force! Why don\u2019t you look in the mirror and see how you look like?! You\u2019ve just been popular for several days and you\u2019ve already forgotten your place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not have any expression when she heard the assistant. Instead, she walked slowly towards Yin Youyou\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou unconsciously stood up as Ning Xi appeared.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stretched her hand, then she dragged the chair behind Yin Youyou out and sat down, her long legs crossed beneath the high-slit skirt. She put her arms on the back of the chair and tilted her head as she scanned everyone in the room. She said slowly, \u201cI want this dressing room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou\u2019s expression darkened and she stared at Ning Xi coldly.</p><br/><p>The assistant was anxious. \u201cBut, Ms. Ning, this is Youyou\u2019s dressing room!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her eyebrow. \u201cOh? Her dressing room? Is her name on it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant did not expect Ning Xi to say the same thing as Xu Tao, and she looked troubled.</p><br/><p>She could scold Xu Tao however much she liked, but she dared not use the same attitude towards Ning Xi. In defense, she took on the victim\u2019s role. \u201cThis is really Youyou\u2019s dressing room. You can ask Director Chen if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d Ning Xi then turned towards Director Chen and asked, \u201cDirector Chen, I\u2019d like to know\u2026 whose dressing room is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen wiped the sweat off his forehead. After a short silence, he replied, \u201cThis\u2026 This, of course, is Ms. Ning Xi\u2019s exclusive dressing room. It\u2019s yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then signaled the female assistant beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant could not believe it. Just as she was about to retort something, she noticed that the female assistant beside Director Chen had gone out.</p><br/><p>She came back soon, and she had a white placard with her.</p><br/><p>Several big words were written on it: Ning Xi\u2019s Exclusive Dressing Room!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s expression did not change at all except for her eyes that were turning colder and colder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you guys\u2026\u201d The assistant looked at this scene in front of her and the director\u2019s attitude. Apparently, she was frustrated.</p><br/><p>Yin Youyou was so angry that her body started trembling. She almost died on the spot out of fury.</p></div>\n</div>"}

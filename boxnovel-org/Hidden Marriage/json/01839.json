With his pair of slippers, he casually sat in a pile of colorful balls.</p><br/><p>After hesitating for some time, he finally switched his phone on.</p><br/><p>As expected, his news feed was all about the press conference today, speaking about how grand it was, and about it being a reunion after two years. There was a slogan of \"No Changge Without Zixuan\", and he even saw an article titled \"Return of The Man: Will Jiang Muye Issue An Apology and Reconcile with Han Zixuan\"?</p><br/><p>Screw that! No apology! What reconciliation!?</p><br/><p>Damn this all!</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was so angry that he almost smashed his phone.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the big screen in the arcade switched channels as the staff had switched it to the web-streaming of the press conference of \"The World\".</p><br/><p>\"Wow! My goddess Xuan Xuan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Right! 'The World' is having an event at the exhibition centre. Too bad I couldn't get a ticket!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why's the screen so dirty today!? My goddess is so beautiful! She just fulfills my desire fully!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The display on the big screen attracted the attention of many people.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was staring at it too.</p><br/><p>Hehe, I am going to see just how stupid these people can be!</p><br/><p>On the screen, Han Zixuan had a striking red outfit on and was performing a simulated fight with a staff. The fans and onlookers around the game centre were impressed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye held his chin as he swung on top of a wooden pony and rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>Half a year of training? Nonsense! With those half-assed movements, it was, at most, a quick three-day training! It looked great because the staff she fought with was skilled. What an act!</p><br/><p>\"Did everyone notice? There's still one other person who's not here today!\"</p><br/><p>\"I heard that this late guest has something to say to our Zixuan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Really? Let's have this guest up onstage quickly then!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When the hosts finished talking, Han Zixuan's fans booed unhappily and the onlookers at the game center were talking about it before the big screen too.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, that shameless bastard! I'd never forgive him!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right! He's just the worst! I liked him quite a bit before but I can't even forgive him when I look at his face now!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye's expression changed when he heard the hosts.</p><br/><p>What is happening!? I am right here! What are they talking about?</p><br/><p>What are these bastards doing?</p><br/><p>Damn you, Lei Ming, if you made decisions for me without asking\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye's murderous intent almost burnt a hole through the big screen.</p><br/><p>After a short while, a person finally went on stage.</p><br/><p>It was not Lei Ming, but Xu Tao.</p><br/><p>Why this guy?</p><br/><p>Did the company send him because they knew Lei Ming was not daring enough?</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye felt rage boil inside him, then he took out his phone and was about to make a call.</p><br/><p>As he was looking for a number, he saw from the corner of his eyes... in the stream, Xu Tao had carefully extended his hand to the back. It seemed like there was still someone there.</p><br/><p>There was a brief white transition, then a silhouette slowly came out of the dark following Xu Tao's lead, coming out on to the stage\u2026</p><br/><p>A plain white qipao , dreamy hair, and a stunning facial appearance\u2026</p><br/><p>She did not need an extravagant outfit or any luxurious accessories. She did not even need any words. Her existence itself was the highlight.</p><br/><p>\"What... the heck!?\"</p><br/><p>When he finally saw who was on screen, Jiang Muye clumsily fell off the wooden pony...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

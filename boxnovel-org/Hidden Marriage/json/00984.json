Not here yet?\"</p><br/><p>\"Will he ditch us?\"</p><br/><p>\"No way! I only came because I heard Bro Xiao is coming!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao looked at her watch and inhaled deeply. \"Just wait a little longer, Tingxiao's in a bad mood. He might've overslept\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Bad mood? What happened?\" Some sharp ones could practically smell the gossip coming.</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao said hesitantly, \"Seems like he argued with his girlfriend\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Massive news!</p><br/><p>\"Really? Did they argue? Didn't they look lovey-dovey together the last time we saw them?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sis Ziyao, are you serious? Did he really argue with that woman?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha, they finally fought! I knew they weren't going to last for long! Could they have already broken up?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's possible! It must be a huge matter to make Bro Xiao argue with her!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao apologized as the group of friends bombarded her with all the questions, \"I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure about the details as well. I just heard Lingtian mention it!\"</p><br/><p>However, she actually knew that after something like that, Lu Tingxiao must have already broken up with Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>The group then shifted their attention to Mo Lingtian.</p><br/><p>\"Master Mo, what happened?\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Mo...Master Mo! Master Mo?\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Mo Lingtian replied annoyingly as he puffed on his cigarette.</p><br/><p>\"Master Mo, why're you daydreaming...? We were just asking what happened to Lu Tingxiao. Did he really break up with Ning Xi?\"</p><br/><p>\"Break up?\" Mo Lingtian was in a bad mood himself, so he did not really pay attention to what they were discussing just now and he was confused how they reached this conclusion.</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, didn't you tell Ziyao that Lu Tingxiao argued with his girlfriend?\" someone asked.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian remembered now that he did say that\u2026but he had just made that excuse up because he did not want Lu Tingxiao to join them.</p><br/><p>Did they really believe me?</p><br/><p>And it seemed like...so did Ziyao.</p><br/><p>Mo Longtian looked at Guan Ziyao. He realized that she looked really cheerful that day and she had changed her usual style of cold colored outfits and wore a smoking red dress that day.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian looked really unwell.</p><br/><p>They stopped asking him as he seemed like he was in a blur daze. They then continued their gossip as they waited.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! It's there! Is that Lu Tingxiao's car?\"</p><br/><p>\"Where?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's his car!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A black four-wheel-drive parked near them. The door opened and Lu Tingxiao walked out.</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao went up to him and beamed, \"You're finally here, Tingxiao. We're all waiting for you, let's go!\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\" Lu Tingxiao nodded.</p><br/><p>When Guan Ziyao started walking, she realized that Lu Tingxiao did not follow her. Instead, he went to the other side of the car and opened the door.</p><br/><p>Had Lu Tingxiao invited someone else?</p><br/><p>A person alighted from the car. It was...Ning Xi?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

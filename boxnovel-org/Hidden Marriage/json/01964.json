From the moment the tiger brought Han Xiao over and the way the tiger acted afterward, they could already tell that it was not vicious.</p><br/><p>However, almost out of instinct, humans would still maintain a certain level of vigilance towards wild beasts who were at the top of the food chain.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at the Bengal tiger and probed by gently calling out, \u201cDarling!\u201d</p><br/><p>When it heard Ning Xi calling out, the white tiger clearly hesitated. It slowly got up and was waving its white tail at Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at the white tiger and he could not help but exclaim in admiration.</p><br/><p>He had many friends abroad who reared wild beasts like brown bears, lions, tigers, and leopards, but ones that seemed to be able to communicate with humans were incredibly rare.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the white tiger walked over to Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi. It was very quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, don\u2019t be afraid. Follow us home.\u201d Ning Xi could not help but touch the white tiger with her hand.</p><br/><p>The white tiger shook its shaggy body. It appeared very tame.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling is superb!\u201d</p><br/><p>She would never have thought that the way she used with Little Treasure would work with the white tiger too. Of course, most importantly, it should be because Han Xiao\u2019s odor had been rubbed on her, so it knew that she had no malicious intent and was Han Xiao\u2019s good friend.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could not help but admire Han Xiao once again. How had he tamed a wild beast at the peak of the food chain like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao dared not relax, he protected Ning Xi on the side and they walked towards their house.</p><br/><p>On the way, Ning Xi could not help but turn around to look at the white tiger from time to time, if it was not for the tiger\u2019s huge size, Ning Xi wished she could pull the tiger into her embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, I want to raise a tiger too!\u201d Ning Xi could not help but exclaim.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly if Han Xiao helps you tame it,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>A normal cat or dog was fine, but it was best not to provoke animals such as lions and tigers who were at the peak of the food chain, even if they had been hand-reared since young. When the tiger grew up, if they were slightly careless, it could lead to tragedy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHire him to help me tame it? I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to afford him.\u201d Ning Xi shook her head. After Han Xiao helps her tame it, would it even still be hers?</p><br/><p>However, it was really so adorable and cute!</p><br/><p>As she watched the Bengal white tiger wag its long, snowy tail at her and its gentle gaze staring at her, Ning Xi felt like her heart was about to melt.</p><br/><p>This was not some ferocious beast. This was a super cute mythical beast!</p><br/><p>Forget rearing a cat or dog\u2026 If she wanted to rear something, it would be a tiger!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When they returned home, half an hour had passed.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the building was designed with a double door, or else, with the Bengal white tiger\u2019s colossal body, it would not even be able to squeeze in.</p><br/><p>Even then, it was not easy for the white tiger to enter the house either.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli stared at the white tiger in the living room and felt his scalp go numb. Goosebumps erupted all over his body.</p><br/><p>Once in a while, when the domineering gaze of the white tiger made eye contact with him, Lu Jingli\u2019s body would shudder.</p><br/><p>If this thing were to suddenly burst in aggression, a hundred of him could be killed by a slap from that huge tiger paw. ( )</p><br/><p>\u201cMy baby, my darling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Ning Xi returned, she had been sticking to the tiger. Her hands kept stroking it. Its soft fur was just so comforting!</p><br/><p>It was the most wonderful feeling in history!</p><br/><p>\u201cShake my hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held up both hands against the tiger\u2019s giant claws and touched its soft pads, relishing the super undefeatable enjoyment\u2026</p><br/><p>What was most astonishing was that this tiger\u2019s sharp claws had unexpectedly retreated back into its pad when playing around with Ning Xi as if it was afraid of accidentally hurting Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy little baby, I really love you to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi very soon familiarized herself with the tiger. She held the tiger\u2019s head dearly and planted a kiss on its forehead.</p></div>\n</div>"}

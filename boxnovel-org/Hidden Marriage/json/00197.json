What did I see? I need to go to the toilet for talking three pounds of s**t!]</p><br/><p>[One may be hacking but now that even Lu Ting Xiao has reposted it, can it be false? Golden Age Entertainment really signed Ning Xi! Even Lu Ting Xiao was stirred up! I can\u2019t understand the world!]</p><br/><p>[Since Lu Ting Xiao reposted this, he must know and even agreed to Golden Entertainment\u2019s decision. Lu Jingli may get carried away by the crowd, but it is absolutely impossible with Lu Ting Xiao! So this situation is very strange!]</p><br/><p>[Yes, there must be something wrong with the situation! Starlight may have the next big move! Just wait for the reversal!]</p><br/><p>[I won\u2019t say anything, I will wait for the reversal! I firmly support my male gods!]</p><br/><p>[Waiting for the truth! I believe in fairness!]</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In short, after Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s reblogged post, the original one-sided public opinion was instantly pulled back. All the users are beginning to remain neutral and some gradually returned to reason.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi just brushed the microblogging incident away, the series of changes were just too amazing.</p><br/><p>Big Boss Lu is too amazing ah!</p><br/><p>The reason was because Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s image was really perfect. After taking over the Lu Group, he had never made the wrong decision. Five years ago, due to the economic crisis, a number of companies went bankrupt.</p><br/><p>The Lu Group were the only ones who not only survived but thrived instead. People say that he is like an oracle, and everyone believes it.</p><br/><p>At the same time in the Lu home\u2019s downstairs living room,</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was holding his mobile phone while lying on the sofa, cursing. \u201cWhat! These bastards are nothing! What do you mean I\u2019m liable to get carried away by the fans, but you can\u2019t! They are simply wrong about me! This is an injustice! It is clear that you are the fans favorite. You! You! You! This is injustice!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he continued howling, Ning Xi arrived at the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was too quiet, I didn\u2019t quite hear what you were complaining about?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Lu Jingli immediately sat up. Some abuse was clearly unspeakable.</p><br/><p>Pacing a few hundred steps at a time around the room he refused to look at Lu Ting Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ignoring him, Lu Ting Xiao looked up from his book at Ning Xi: \u201cWelcome back. Did you meet Lin Zhizhi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded repeatedly, \u201cYes, I saw elder sister Lin. It was quite a good meeting. She is completely my favorite type of person; a cold face that looks strict but makes you feel safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d It seems like there was no problem, but the way she worded it left him feeling a bit insecure.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately turned to stare at Lu Jingli. \u201cYou! Why are you so impatient? Why did you announce my signing onto Golden Age this early, hmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli gave her a brilliant expression and began: \u201cOf course it is to add some flames for you to increase your popularity! You see, the more buzz, the more people will continue talking about you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u201d Ning Xi cried, \u201cIf Lu Ting Xiao didn\u2019t save the day, we were almost accused of being adulterers together you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lu Jingli heard this, he finally had a guilty expression and muttered: \u201dScolded. Always being scolded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways,\u201d he continued \u201cTomorrow is the reveal!\u201d He expected that the fans would curse, but didn\u2019t think that it would become so ugly from people\u2019s jealousy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe sure you send microblog notices to different correspondents to convene at the conference tomorrow.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao reminded Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll send it now.\u201d Not long after, Ning Xi released it. Lu Jingli reblogged it and Lin Zhizhi followed soon after.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ning Xi\u2019s phone screen flashed and a phone call came in. The caller ID \u2013 Jiang Muye</p><br/><p>Chapter 197 \u2013 The Fans Favorite Is Clearly You Teaser</p><br/><p>At the same time in the Lu home\u2019s downstairs living room,</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was holding his mobile phone while lying on the sofa, cursing. \u201cWhat!

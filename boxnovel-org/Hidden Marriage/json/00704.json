Lu Tingxiao, I\u2019m going to make him beg for forgiveness even with just one foot of mine!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao sighed helplessly. He had to be careful with her even if it was just a parent-child activity in school. If he did not hold her back, she would act like a wild horse without restraint...</p><br/><p>The child and his father went away, leaving the teacher weeping.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, are you alright?\" Ning Xi went up to her and gave her a tissue, her eyes flashing with anger.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! You guys...are Lu Qingyu\u2019s parents, aren't you? He\u2019s been waiting! I\u2019m alright. Did you guys see everything just now?\"</p><br/><p>The teacher was afraid that the parents would have a bad impression on the school, so she quickly explained, \"Please don\u2019t mind it, this parent is just a special case. Most of the parents from our school are well mannered!\"</p><br/><p>This teacher had been protecting Little Treasure, so Ning Xi did not blame her. \"It\u2019s alright. We understand that there\u2019s always someone like them around.\"</p><br/><p>But the incident just now worried Ning Xi a little. Was Little Treasure being bullied in school?</p><br/><p>According to his personality, he would not say anything even if he was bullied\u2026</p><br/><p>The teacher could take a stab at Ning Xi\u2019s worries as well. She quickly told her, \"Lu Qingyu is adapting well to the school. Although he doesn\u2019t talk much, many children like him and he\u2019s especially popular with the girls!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes shone. Little Treasure was popular with the girls?</p><br/><p>That was a surprise!</p><br/><p>But, well, it was her handsome son after all! It was normal for him to be popular!</p><br/><p>\"This Sun Zhuangzhuang is a famous troublemaker. His parents don't care either and us teachers are troubled when facing him...but we\u2019ve been observing him closely, please rest assured\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The party was going to start soon, so after a short chat with the both of them, the teacher left to finish the preparations.</p><br/><p>By the first column near the middle and right beside the window, there was a small shadow sitting by himself.</p><br/><p>The snowflakes outside matched his ice-cold face, just like his father\u2019s.</p><br/><p>He was holding a big book and was totally immersed in his own world. What happened outside just now was unable to upset his small, pure world.</p><br/><p>\"Little Treasure\u2026\"</p><br/><p>With a gentle call, his invisible barrier was broken and his eyes slowly came back to reality\u2026</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was surprised. He sat up straight and lifted his head up from the book, looking at the direction of the voice.</p><br/><p>Aunty Xiao Xi!</p><br/><p>Obviously, he totally ignored his father.</p><br/><p>The little guy blinked and did not move for a few seconds. After he was sure that he was not hallucinating, he left his book on the table and ran\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Little Treasure...I\u2019m sorry\u2026\" Ning Xi\u2019s heart was at ease as Little Treasure ran into her arms.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

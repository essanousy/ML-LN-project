How could you have been hurt this severely?\u201d Lu Jingli looked at Han Xiao and asked recklessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, I fell asleep and was ambushed.\u201d Han Xiao rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you\u2019re so amazing. How were you ambushed?\u201d Lu Jingli was incredibly puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m so amazing, do you believe that I can kill you with one hand?\u201d Han Xiao stared intensely at Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, the person that ambushed you is a bastard. As they say, an honest person does nothing underhand, especially for life or death duels between masters. How could he have used such a despicable, shameless, lowly trick?\u201d Lu Jingli seemed like he detested the person. ( )</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, who\u2019s this?\u201d Han Xiao shot Ning Xi a confused look.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother-in-law\u2026 Earlier, he was frightened by your tiger. He\u2019s a little talkative. Don\u2019t mind him.\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, how were you brought here by a tiger?\u201d Ning Xi asked about the elephant in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my friend.\u201d Han Xiao yawned. \u201cA Bengal white tiger\u2026 He\u2019s been following me since he was young. It\u2019s been seven years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless. She had really guessed correctly. It was indeed a beast domesticated by this madman!</p><br/><p>Han Xiao suddenly realized that his tiger was not around. He swiveled and asked, \u201cEh, where\u2019s my white tiger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let my white tiger in?\u201d Han Xiao asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi helplessly put her hand to her forehead. \u201cPlease, Master, not everyone can be as abnormal as you. That\u2019s a beast that you raised. Use your head to think. In a situation in which we know nothing of, who would dare to let a tiger enter their house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid about? My white tiger\u2019s even smarter than people. He wouldn\u2019t do anything to you.\u201d Han Xiao immediately got up and wanted to go out to look for the tiger.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet him rest well,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded and quickly pulled Han Xiao back. \u201cYou lie down properly. Don\u2019t torment yourself anymore, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wound had just been sterilized and stitched up. He could not exercise or move around much. If he walked out and the wound got infected or opened up, it would be very troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go and look for it for you.\u201d Lu Tingxiao put his coat on.</p><br/><p>The person before him had saved Little Treasure and Ning Xi before, so it was reasonable to help to look for his tiger.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Lu Tingxiao said to Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>With such mind-blowing grievous news, Lu Jingli almost cried. \u201cBro\u2026 I can\u2019t leave the Master. Look at how severe his injuries are. What if he\u2019s thirsty or anything? I can still help out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Making him walk out to find a huge white tiger in the middle of the night?! What a brother!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes. \u201cDarling, let me go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she said to Lu Jingli, \u201cStay at home to watch the Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli nodded like a rattle-drum.</p><br/><p>In the living room, only Lu Jingli and Han Xiao, who looked at each other in consternation, were left.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, can\u2026 can you teach me how to tame a tiger?\u201d Lu Jingli seized this great opportunity to ask.</p><br/><p>Han Xiao replied, \u201cDo tigers need to be tamed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the dark of the night, the two of them walked all about to look for traces of the white tiger.</p><br/><p>If they did not find it before dawn, it would frighten the people in town when day broke and probably cause a disturbance.</p><br/><p>They had walked around to look for about a few minutes when on a small hillside, Ning Xi\u2019s figure stopped. She used her flashlight to shine ahead and immediately pulled on Lu Tingxiao\u2019s arm. \u201cLook!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao turned around and looked where the flashlight shone.</p><br/><p>There was a huge white tiger crouching on the ground, his beady eyes staring back at Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao.</p></div>\n</div>"}

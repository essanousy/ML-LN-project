Watch how you speak! What do you mean blind? Even you fancied Su Yan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed, \u201cBlame youth. Neither men nor dogs can see truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2026 \u2026 \u201cJiang Muye was speechless with anger. Finally, he angrily said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know how sinister and cunning Lu Ting Xiao is right? In order to keep me away, even such shameless means aren\u2019t left out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having prepared himself to see Ning Xi\u2019s regretful expression. The result was to see her smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cBOSS is really wise. He can really see thousands of miles away and create a strategy\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye face is as black as the bottom of a pot, \u201cNing Xi, you are really hopeless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly walked towards him, her expression full of ill intentions,\u201dHey, you and Zhizhi sister. Is the matter done? Look at your expression, it seems that she\u2019s not only an ex-girlfriend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye, this guy can\u2019t be so afraid just because of an ex-girlfriend.</p><br/><p>\u201cMind yourself!\u201d He snapped at her, then hesitantly asked, \u201cDid she call to tell you anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged, \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything. Just said that the screenwriters are modifying the script. It should take about two weeks to be finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMing brother also told me that after the change, Meng Changge and Sun Huanqing\u2019s lines will be more prominent. As for Ning Xuelo\u2019s and Zhao Sizhou\u2019s characters, the substitutions are not clear. But Lu Ting Xiao will certainly take care of you so there will definitely be substitutions!\u201d Jiang Muye replied acidly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi only shook her head, \u201cWrong, if Lu Ting Xiao really wanted to help me, then from my point of view he will certainly not make substitutions. Because in the drama, for me to defeat Ning Xuelo with my strength and let her perish is the most succulent form of revenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice fading away, Ning Xi\u2019s phone showed some new entertainment information. She had subscribed to certain sources and each time when there was breaking news, she will receive alerts.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi finished reading, her mouth turned slightly upwards, displaying a frightening, ungirly face.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye glanced at her expression suspiciously, then went to see what the news was about. Shengshi Gang News announcement that since Lu Groups addition to Golden Age, Starlight Entertainment had withdrawn funds from \u201cLand Under Heaven\u201d project. It was now solely owned by Golden Age.</p><br/><p>From a shooting perspective of the drama, the original actors will not change\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at Ning Xi and Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s tacit understanding with each other, Jiang</p><br/><p>Muye\u2019s heart felt waves of panic.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201cI think you are completely trapped and don\u2019t even know it. So, you really like Lu Ting Xiao\u2026\u2026you really can\u2019t hold back from him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laying on the grass, grabbed a blade and stuck it in her mouth.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cWhy does liking someone mean you have to be together? Even if the get together, how many people stay together till the end? The state we\u2019re in currently is very good\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, the best result is that he would be her friend and confidant. Even if the worst result comes to pass, at least there will be the memories of the most beautiful time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

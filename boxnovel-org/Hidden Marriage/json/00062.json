So what if I call you that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m going to have it out with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me! I was still worried you wouldn\u2019t dare to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! This damned woman, you\u2019re really hitting me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The backseat rocked with clatters and commotion, and the manager, Lei Ming, driving in the front was completely speechless, \u201cMuye, I told you you wouldn\u2019t be able to outplay her but you wouldn\u2019t believe me. Are you happy now? Tomorrow\u2019s headline is going to change from \u2018Hot chick picks Jiang Muye up from the airport\u2019 to \u2018Old lady picks Jiang Muye up from the airport\u2019\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye, who was currently being pinned down by Ning Xi, was flustered and exasperated, \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei Ming looked at the battlefield in the backseat from the rearview mirror, and his mouth twitched as his head was filled with sweatdrops, \u201cNing Xi, could you go easier on him? Take it that I\u2019m pleading you! He has to film a movie, a commercial and a special magazine feature this month\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, Ming-ge, I won\u2019t hit his face\u2026 You better stop squirming about!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Jiang Muye had completely lost the handsome and elegant image he had at the airport, he was currently handcuffed by both hands and pressed down on the car seat. He looked like he had been ravaged.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2026 you forced me to do this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was still happily beating him up, but Jiang Muye abruptly used his cuffed hands to wrap around the back of her neck and pulled her down with him\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing that handsome face close up so suddenly, Ning Xi subconsciously backed away and raised her head, a carefree smile on her face, \u201cWhat, you\u2019re going to use your beauty since you can\u2019t beat me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to kiss her lips, Jiang Muye abruptly turned away, \u201cEuurgghh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahahaha\u2026\u201d Ning Xi laughed until she had to hold her stomach and curled up, \u201cCome try it again! Kiss, kiss me here! Isn\u2019t granny\u2019s makeup so pretty today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ning Xi\u2019s wrinkled and pockmarked face, Jiang Muye laid there like a dead fish, as if he had lost all interest in life.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally finished laughing and panted for breath as she sat up, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re really angry? Who made you try to trap me first! You\u2019re not going to let me take revenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, we haven\u2019t met in so long, can\u2019t you miss me just a little bit? You actually beat me up when we finally met again!\u201d Jiang Muye glared at her with anger, and even a trace of grievance in the depths of his pupils.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled, \u201cOf course I did! Didn\u2019t I say it at the airport? Granny misses you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d To prevent himself from dying from excessive anger, Jiang Muye finally gave up communicating with her. He raised his handcuffed hands and said in a rage, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you untied me yet! Where the heck did you get these handcuffs? These are prohibited items in China, aren\u2019t they!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rubbed her chin, \u201cThis, well it seems like I bought it from a sex goods shop on Taobao! It was 20% off, it only cost $9.90!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei Ming: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Worried that the two of them were going to fight again, Lei Ming hurriedly changed the topic, \u201cWe\u2019ve already left the reporters and fans behind, where are we going now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye pulled out a hand mirror to rescue his hair. Upon hearing his manager\u2019s words, he didn\u2019t even raise his head as he said, \u201cGo back to my residence in the city outskirts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately sat up, \u201cThen let me down by the roadside, I\u2019ll take a cab home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, did you think you could run away tonight? I\u2019ll see where you try to run!\u201d Jiang Muye gritted his teeth sinisterly and locked the car doors tight.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Ning Xi sweatdropped. She knew that this would happen.</p><br/><p>On the road, as they continued driving, Ning Xi felt that something wasn\u2019t right. Why was this road so familiar?</p><br/><p>\u201cMr Rich Boy Jiang, you have properties in Beijing? That property wouldn\u2019t happen to be in Platinum Palace, would it?\u201d Ning Xi tried asking.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye harrumphed, \u201cIt is, so what? Suddenly thinking of hugging my big leg? It\u2019s too late, I tell you! Unless you call me grandfather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was a little despondent.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be such a coincidence that Jiang Muye\u2019s residence was also at Platinum Palace?</p><br/><p>For some reason, blaring alarms started sounding off in her mind, giving her an unpleasant premonition\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Let\u2019s return to Imperial tomorrow together. Let me take a look at Spirit\u2019s headquarters and we\u2019ll get the contract signed. How does that sound?\" Deng Kuan beamed.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, we\u2019ll welcome you. It\u2019s set then. If there\u2019re any more questions, you can contact me anytime.\" Ning Xi\u2019s expression softened.</p><br/><p>After a short casual chat with Deng Kuan and agreeing on the time to go back together to sign the contract, Ning Xi left with Han Momo.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Han Momo went straight back to their hotel after they left New Era mall.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Just a moment after Ning Xi left, a man walked into Deng Kuan\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Deng, please allow me to introduce myself. I\u2019m the Marketing Director of History, Qin Zifan.\" The man looked at Deng Kuan smilingly.</p><br/><p>\"History?\"</p><br/><p>Deng Kuan was a little taken aback. Of course, he knew about History. History had been founded earlier than Spirit. Coincidentally, both their brand positionings and styles were similar. Everyone knew that these two luxury brands were currently competing.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Zifan...if I remember correctly, you\u2019re the former Marketing Director of SF?\" Deng Kuan took a glance at Qin Zifan, seeming to remember him.</p><br/><p>Qin Zifan nodded, not denying it.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, Mr. Qin, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re too late, I\u2019ve already made an agreement with Spirit. I\u2019m going to franchise Spirit\u2019s brand. Sorry but you\u2019ve wasted your efforts to come here.\"</p><br/><p>An experienced businessman like Deng Kuan could surely guess Qin Zifan\u2019s intentions for being there.</p><br/><p>\"Oh...hmm, an oral agreement?\" Qin Zifan pondered, \"I believe as a businessman, I\u2019ll be straightforward with you. We\u2019re really interested in working with you. This proposal was written by me personally. You may take a look before making a conclusion.\"</p><br/><p>Deng Kuan took the proposal and read through it patiently.</p><br/><p>\"Two points lower than Spirit?!\"</p><br/><p>Deng Kuan was shocked. This offer was much more attractive than Spirit\u2019s!</p><br/><p>\"If you accept our offer, from the brand management to the supply and training of the salespeople, we\u2019ll make the necessary arrangements directly from our headquarters, and most importantly, any fees needed for promotions will be provided by us as well.\" Qin Zifan offered an extremely attractive deal.</p><br/><p>Deng Kuan took some time to contemplate. \"Well, we\u2019re all friends. Let\u2019s have dinner tonight and go through the details\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Qian Zifan gave Ning Xueluo a call after he came out of the office.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, it\u2019s done! I told you so, the Marketing Director of Spirit is just a nobody!\"</p><br/><p>He ended the call with a wide grin, then left.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day, in the hotel room, Ning Xi received an abrupt message from Deng Kuan. He said that after a long consideration, they decided to give up Spirit and choose History instead. The main reason was that History made a better offer.</p><br/><p>\"How could he be like this? That Mr. Deng broke our promise!\" Han Momo expressed her injustice of the situation.</p><br/><p>\"We were too careless this time. Anyhow, we should go there and confirm with him directly\u2026\" Ning Xi\u2019s expression turned serious. She did not say much and went straight to New Era mall. She then realized that Deng Kuan had made his decision earlier</p><br/><p> He had invited Ning Xi for lunch but had not said anything about Spirit\u2019s franchise.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You've lost everything! Go home and look for your mother, so she can feed you milk!\" The man hissed.</p><br/><p>The moment he said that, the entire casino instantly burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhuang Rongguang had really lost it all. The clothes on him were all branded and had been taken off as loan collateral. Even the genuine leather wallet his sister had given him for birthday was gone too.</p><br/><p>He was initially prepared to earn some money for the road, yet he had lost all of his life savings instead. Most importantly, he had initially won all those money, but it had now all been gambled away. Withthis roller coaster ride, his young chest was furiously heaving and no matter what, he was unwilling to back down. \"Stand right there! Go another round with me! If I lose, then I'll owe you!\"</p><br/><p>The man with laughed aloud, \"Hahahaha...little brother, I don't do that owing thing! I want to see cash!\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! Can't I just owe that little bit of money? Come on! If I lose, I'll immediatey have someone send money over!\" Zhuang Rongguang roared.</p><br/><p>\"Pfft...it looks like you wouldn't let it go if we don't go for another round. Then, I'll just be kind and go one more round with you!\" The man returned to the gambling table.</p><br/><p>Moments later...</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang fell, stupefied on his chair and moaning, \"No way...no way! One more!\"</p><br/><p>The man revealed a vicious expression at the sound of this. \"We can go for one more, but you'll have to return the five million you owe me first!\"</p><br/><p>\"I...I'll just give you all of it altogether later!\" When he heard that he had lost five million without realizing it, Zhuang Rongguang's expression changed.</p><br/><p>\"Pfft! You little punk, you want to trick me!? I've already let you owe me for five rounds now! You want to owe me more? Who do you think I am? Quickly get someone to send the money over! Or else...\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang had wanted to say something, but he was instantly surrounded by a few of burly guys and they all looked malicious. </p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang's back was slick with sweat now. He quickly pulled his two friends beside and asked, \"Do you guys still have money on you?\"</p><br/><p>\"We don't have anymore money. All that we have has been given to you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly, even my watch has been taken out for collateral!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Then what do we do now? This was all becuase of you guys who made me come here to gamble!\" Zhuang Rongguang was frantic now.</p><br/><p>\"How dare you say that? We only brought you here cause we're nice and you said you needed money. There's winning and losing in gambling. We can't control things like your luck either!\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop talking crap. I don't care what ways you think of. Quickly help me get the money!\"</p><br/><p>\"Where are we suppose get five million?!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"You lot, are you done discussing?! If you don't show me the money, I need one of you to leave a hand!\" The man shouted at him sininsterly.</p><br/><p>These kind of things happened too often in the casino, so everyone just watched with the attention of an audience, or just ignored them and focused on their own games.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang's face turned pale. \"What are you rushing for? Aren't I getting the money for you now?\"</p><br/><p>He carefully evaluated those people. Apart from that man with the gold chain, there was another blonde who seemed to be the lead. That blonde's gaze was devillish, his entire body filled with exaggerative tattoos and even scars. His mouth was full of vulgarities and he was obviously a gangster, but he did not look local and even had an accent in between his speech. He looked like someone from out of town.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

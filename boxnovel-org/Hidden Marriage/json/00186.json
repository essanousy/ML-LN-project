Spending hundreds of thousands for a broken car?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi heard this and almost laughed, \u201cFor you, you judge a man\u2019s standard by how much money he spends on a car?\u201d</p><br/><p>According to him, he doesn\u2019t care about her being kept but cares about her backers not being powerful enough.</p><br/><p>If she had a Bentley, is it more noble?</p><br/><p>\u201cDisregarding the car, do you not see the face? I thought that you had found a strong backer behind you! You actually found a small, half-baked(kept man/a bitch) man! You\u2019re really regressing!\u201d Ning Yaohua shouted more abuse.</p><br/><p>Although the man looks good, but to show this car, he is at most just a small company owner.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d He actually said Lu Ting Xiao is a small, half-baked(kept/a bitch) man\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua continues scolding Ning Xi and turns to see Lu Ting Xiao, \u201cWho are you! Do you know who she is? She\u2019s my Ning Yaohuas\u2019 daughter and you dare to play?! Believe it or not, I\u2019ll let you in if I fail to make you meet god/emperor! (not sure about this translation )</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao in front of outsiders cherishes his words like gold, now facing Ning Yaohuas\u2019 condescending arrogance, even he has a glare.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua wants to continue to humiliate him, but he doesn\u2019t know why his hear felt a chill and he suddenly couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Why does such a small boss have such an imposing manner\u2026.</p><br/><p>Well, he\u2019s not this daughter that is allowing herself to be fooled by his looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, what I said last night is still valid, you can choose now to go back with me!\u201d Ning Yaohua said with a charitable tone.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s lips smirk while she hooks intimate arms around the side of the arm of Lu Ting Xiao, \u201cI am sorry, I choose my family\u2019s half-baked man! You go back where you came from!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi! You\u2019ll be sorry!\u201d Looking at the two people hold hands sets Ning Yaohua in a rage, then with a gloomy face he told the bodyguard, \u201cto keep up with them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Today let him experience too many unexpected things, one is Ning Xi\u2019s skill, the impression that his daughter is physically weak is nothing but a lie. (originally said tied to the power of chicken)</p><br/><p>In addition, what is the identity of this man? He always felt that something is wrong</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..back to the car Ning Xi scratched her head while apologizing to Lu Ting Xiao, \u201cI am sorry ah! I involved you inexplicably and got you scolded\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Although scolded, Lu Ting Xiao is not angry at all. The reason why is naturally because of Ning Xi\u2019s last hug, and even the small half-baked man because she added in front the words \u2018my family\u2019, this attribute turning it into a sweet nickname.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

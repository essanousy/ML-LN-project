Also, what\u2019s wrong with Little Treasure? He hasn\u2019t eaten a bite of food all night and he\u2019s holding that phone like it\u2019s a priceless treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was chewing on some sweet-and-sour ribs, so his voice was unclear, \u201cLittle Treasure is waiting for the pretty lady\u2019s call!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Lu was completely confused, \u201cWhat pretty lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli waved his hands, \u201cMum, dad, don\u2019t worry so much. Brother already has someone he likes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Lu was surprised but uncertain, \u201cYou\u2019re telling the truth? Jingli, don\u2019t trick us!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time Master Lu also solemnly put down his chopsticks, eyeing Jingli suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I try to trick you, this is absolutely true. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask him!\u201d Lu Jingli looked towards his brother as he said so.</p><br/><p>\u201cTingxiao, is what Jingli said real?\u201d Master Lu asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cTingxiao, say something!\u201d Madam Lu prompted him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Lu was extremely anxious. After waiting for half the day she had only heard the sound \u201cEn\u201d. Immediately her gut was full of fire, \u201cYou horrible child, can\u2019t you add even a single word? Why is talking to you always so difficult!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Elders: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So he really only said one word.</p><br/><p>Madam Lu still couldn\u2019t keep from worrying. She hesitantly asked, \u201cTingxiao, the person you like\u2026\u2026is it a girl or a boy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression turned slightly dark, almost gritting his teeth as he said three words, \u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli laughed so hard he almost rolled off his chair, \u201cOf course it\u2019s a girl. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s a very pretty young lady. Our Little Treasure also especially likes her, the phone call Little Treasure is waiting for is from her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Lu almost cried from joy after hearing this, \u201cOur ancestors have blessed and protected us, ancestors have blessed and protected us! Tingxiao, which family is she from? How old is she? Where does she come from? What does she do? What kind of people are in her family? Why didn\u2019t you notify us of anything\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli hurriedly stopped her, \u201cMom, calm down! A lot of things haven\u2019t been set in stone yet. We didn\u2019t tell you because we were afraid you would interfere and mess everything up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Things would probably go sour if they knew Ning Xi\u2019s identity. Ning Xi\u2019s reputation was bad, and she was also in the entertainment industry.</p><br/><p>At this time, Master Lu also opened his mouth, \u201cIt\u2019s someone that Tingxiao approves. We won\u2019t have any problems, don\u2019t blindly worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019m worrying? Do you not worry? Who is it that\u2019s so distressed that they can\u2019t fall asleep in the middle of the night? Who ends up going on the porch to smoke?\u201d Madam Lu mercilessly exposed her husband.</p><br/><p>However, she felt much more at ease after hearing her husband\u2019s words, \u201cTingxiao\u2019s opinion of others is very strict, so the girl he picks definitely wouldn\u2019t be subpar. What\u2019s even more rare is that Little Treasure likes her too!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the phone Little Treasure had been carrying for the whole evening suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>This phone was Lu Tingxiao\u2019s personal phone number, very few people knew it.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli went over to see, it really was Ning Xi\u2019s number.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that girl calling?\u201d Madam Lu asked excited, as if she was immediately going to see her daughter-in-law.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli nodded his head repeatedly and helped Little Treasure receive the call. Little Treasure didn\u2019t really know how to use the cell phone. Lu Tingxiao had bought one for him before, but he didn\u2019t like to use it and threw it somewhere.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the whole table focused on the phone in Little Treasure\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had the thickest skin and directly went next to the phone to eavesdrop.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

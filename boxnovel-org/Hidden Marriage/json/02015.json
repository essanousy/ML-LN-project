I didn\u2019t want to do this, but I didn\u2019t expect you not to give everyone an answer. Don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s a mistake for you to become a mistress and destroy someone\u2019s family? I really feel disgusted about being in the same room as someone like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan was assuming the role of a moral officer, being on Ning Xueluo\u2019s side and criticizing Ning Xi. No one would feel her words were too harsh, and many even agreed with her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi still remained seated. She supported her head with an arm as she looked at the Han Zixuan who was fuming in the name of justice. She simply smiled and put on a sympathetic expression. \u201cYou want an answer? Then, I\u2019ll give you one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi then signaled Xu Tao.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was already impatient. The moment he finally got permission from his queen, he happily dashed up on-stage like a bird being let out of its cage.</p><br/><p>Everyone was revealed expressions of doubt and whispered to each other when they saw Xu Tao going up on-stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat trick is Xu Tao trying to pull again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Tao is the best at brainwashing the fans. Could he claim that it\u2019s true love between Ning Xi and Su Yan? That\u2019ll be disgusting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWanting to save your reputation after being a witch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr maybe he\u2019ll announce her retirement right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Off stage, Han Zixuan and Zheng Anru looked at Xu Tao coldly as he went up on stage. All the reporters had their cameras aimed at Xu Tao as well.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xu Tao spoke with the host, then he fiddled with the projector.</p><br/><p>Soon, the big screen lit up again.</p><br/><p>Without any preparation!</p><br/><p>Without any warning!</p><br/><p>An extremely X-rated, indescribable video entered everyone\u2019s line of sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 Ah\u2026 Quicker\u2026 Deeper\u2026 Deeper\u2026 You\u2019re the best, CEO Yi\u2026 I want more\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft!\u201d A certain reporter who was in the midst of drinking water spit it all out on the reporter in front of him.</p><br/><p>A female artiste who was touching up her makeup dropped her compact mirror on the floor. The host who had just wanted to see some gossip almost had his eyes pop out of their sockets.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God! Filthy! What is Xu Tao doing? Is he mad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he get the wrong drive? Xu Tao\u2019s taste is pretty heavy! Does he like such a wild idol?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As everyone was laughing and reprimanding the video, no one noticed that in the corner\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan stood there as if thunder had just struck her.</p><br/><p>Fueled by the moaning from the video, Han Zixuan\u2019s face turned pale very quickly. Even her makeup could not hide her greenish face now.</p><br/><p><em>How did it become like this!?</em></p><br/><p><em>Stop!</em></p><br/><p><em>Stop it!</em></p><br/><p>Han Zixuan was roaring internally, but as the crowd was watching the video, her blood froze. She felt her whole body stiffen and she could not even make a sound.</p><br/><p><em>Shut it down! Quickly!</em></p><br/><p>God did not listen to Han Zixuan\u2019s wish. As the next scene came on, a familiar face appeared in the video.</p><br/><p>Clad in a sexy black lingerie and with long waves of hair tumbling down, the one who was enjoying herself\u2026 was Han Zixuan!</p><br/><p>The man from the video was clearly identified as well. It was the ex-CEO of Glory World Entertainment, Yi Xudong!</p></div>\n</div>"}

In the end, it was exactly as he expected. Lu Tingxiao rejected all his overtures.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao hadn\u2019t even glanced at the priceless antique calligraphy scroll that he had bought through no easy means. He even brought a fresh and bright virgin girl and hinted at giving her to him, but his expression was the same as if he were looking at some vegetables.</p><br/><p>Just as he was getting anxious, the call he had been waiting for finally came.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, why are you only calling me now? Have you done it yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ve done it. We\u2019re on the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up! Bring that person over in 10 minutes! The room is 808, don\u2019t get it wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease rest assured! We\u2019ll definitely send her over on time! This girl\u2019s quite pretty, even me and my brother are a little aroused!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dare to touch her, then don\u2019t even think about getting the rest of the money! I have uses for that woman! Not a single hair on her head must be missing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Not far away, Lu Tingxiao was sitting on a high chair. He looked at the time on his watch and adjusted his sleeves before standing up. From the looks of it, he was preparing to say his goodbyes and leave.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a man suddenly burst out of the pool with a toss of his hair, creating a refreshing splash of water. His tan skin looked healthy and alluring, and he had beautiful six-pack abs and a V-line that countless men would die for\u2026</p><br/><p>The man raised his arrogant and handsome face, his dripping wet hand grabbed onto Lu Tingxiao\u2019s calf just as he was about to walk away. With an unhappy tone, he said, \u201cHey hey hey, Lu Tingxiao, I was the one who called for this gathering today, can you give me some face? You\u2019re leaving after just half an hour ? We\u2019re here for a drinking party and you didn\u2019t even have a sip of alcohol after coming here! We have fine wine and beauties here, can nothing make you stay a while longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d Lu Tingxiao frowned. He looked as if he was about to step on that man\u2019s hands in the next moment.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lu Jingli walked over from behind, carrying a wineglass in his hands. He smiled and said, \u201cTian-ge, haven\u2019t you seen that my bro\u2019s heart completely isn\u2019t even here tonight? Staying for half an hour is already giving you face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian leaned on the pool\u2019s edge with a devil-may-care smile on his face, \u201cIf his heart isn\u2019t here, then where is it? He doesn\u2019t have a woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli looked like he was prepared to shock him as he snorted, \u201cWho said that he doesn\u2019t? He\u2019ll have one soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! That\u2019s too much!\u201d Mo Lingtian was shocked, as expected. With a splash, he jumped out from the pool, his face full of betrayal and anger, \u201cDidn\u2019t we agree that we would be bros for life? The one who first gets a girl is a dog!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao cast a sideways glance at him expressionlessly, \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever agreeing to something so pointless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli couldn\u2019t help but spit out, \u201cTian-ge, you\u2019ve chosen to walk a solitary path so you can choose to flirt however you want, but my bro has a son. He has to find a mother for his child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the woman?\u201d Mo Lingtian frowned as he asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at his watch again. His expression was already extremely impatient. He then strode outside quickly and completely ignored them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! He actually ignored me! What happened to bros before hoes!\u201d Mo Lingtian scolded from behind.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had left, so Lu Jingli followed behind. Compared to a boring drinking party, he wanted to see how his bro tried to pick up girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe, Bro, you\u2019re rushing back to celebrate Sister-in-law\u2019s birthday, right? Do tell what surprises you\u2019ve prepared for her! I\u2019ll help you judge them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli jabbered on as he followed behind Lu Tingxiao, when a fatty came charging out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO Lu! Second Young Master!\u201d The newcomer was sweating like a pig. From the looks of it, he had come running after them.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli raised an eyebrow, \u201cYa, Chairman Zhu! What are you in such a hurry for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m looking for CEO Lu!\u201d Zhu Xiangcheng looked at Lu Tingxiao, face full of flattery. He used both hands to hand over a thin, gold room keycard, \u201cCEO Lu, this is a little gift from me, please accept it!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clear that he had prepared a woman in the room for Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

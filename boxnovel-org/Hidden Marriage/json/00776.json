Don't be angry now, Jiang Muye is voted as the number one guy girls want to have as booty call! Doesn't that console you a little?\"</p><br/><p>\"Console, my ass!\" At least, a booty call gets more than a one-night stand!</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay. Yang Shirou is here, get ready, official business comes first!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The restaurant door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>After Yang Shirou entered, she was at a loss. The entire restaurant was dimly lit, and there was no one inside.</p><br/><p>What was happening?</p><br/><p>Could the restaurant be closed today but no one informed her?</p><br/><p>If it wasn't open...then...she would not be able to see that guy today...</p><br/><p>She had tried very hard to tell herself to calm down, that even if he really took a liking to her, a man like Lu Jingli was probably only just doing this on a whim.</p><br/><p>However, deep in her heart was filled with silly temptation and a wild longing; she had still been touched by his actions...</p><br/><p>Even though she was from a poor family, she was born with a naturally good figure and pretty looks.

What does your remark mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by CEO Ning poaching your guy right in front of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026 You\u2019re Spirit\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As the reporters surrounded Ning Xi frantically, Gong Shangze\u2019s deep voice boomed in the chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Ning Xi is my boss. She\u2019s the founder of Spirit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned by Gong Shangze\u2019s confirmation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! The owner of Spirit is Ning Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow shocking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder Ning Xi never took on any endorsements for clothing brands! She has her own company!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe spokesperson for Spirit has always been Qiao Weilan, and since she works under Qin Shengyue, I\u2019ve always thought that Spirit\u2019s owner was Qin Shengyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only did Ning Xi take away Qin Shengyue\u2019s best subordinate, she even found a genius like Gong Shangze!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Gong, you mean that Ms. Ning is your boss and the founder of Spirit?\u201d A reporter asked him in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze nodded and replied, \u201cBack then, nobody believed what I said. With all hope lost and begging on the streets in Lorraine, Boss found me and believed in me. She brought me back to China and set up Spirit. She\u2019s supported me all the way till today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters continued with the questions. \u201cSo, that\u2019s how it was?! How did you and Ms. Ning Xi meet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze pursed his lips. As though it was a fond memory of his, he said gently, \u201cBack then, she bought a lot of clothes from History. When she passed by me, she gave me a sandwich because I kept staring at her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI noticed the clothes and realized that one of them was an unfinished draft of mine, but there were too many flaws, so I pointed them out. I was filled with anger and rage when I saw my half-finished work stolen. I criticized the clothing with a very bad attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one would listen to a beggar saying such bad things\u2026 but Boss listened to me from the beginning till the end. She even listened to my whole story\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze\u2019s eyes turned red when he thought about his past.</p><br/><p>Everyone was attracted by the young man\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze took a deep breath and continued, \u201cAfter that experience back then, I gave up hope. I couldn\u2019t design anything anymore, but the appearance of Boss gave me hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the way back to the country, as I thought I could never design anymore, I created the first work after going back. It was called \u2018Nirvana Reincarnated\u2019. I received an award for it, giving me a whole new start\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to recognize the name. \u201cAh! So \u2018Nirvana Reincarnated\u2019 had such a story behind it! No wonder it packs so much power and impact!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

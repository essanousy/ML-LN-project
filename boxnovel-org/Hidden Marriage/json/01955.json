I thought I\u2019d never see you again,\u201d Han Xiao said as he wiped the grease off his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to you!\u201d While the guy said that, he did not look genuine at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, I have to return the favor since you bought me a meal\u2026 Several people are following you.\u201d Han Xiao smiled as he stared at Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s following me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was shocked. She would not have realized it if Han Xiao had not told her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey came into the shop with you just now and they seemed to be trained. With your body condition as it is now, they could squeeze you to death like a little chick,\u201d said Han Xiao as a matter-of-fact.</p><br/><p><em>You are the chick! Your whole family are chickens!</em></p><br/><p>Although she really was a chick in the Master\u2019s eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a popular star, yet you only put on some disguise when going out. Don\u2019t have you have any bodyguards?\u201d Han Xiao shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBodyguards? I have you. Why do I need any bodyguards, Big Bro Han Xiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at Han Xiao and gave him her widest smile.</p><br/><p>Of course, she would never bring anyone else when she came to see Han Xiao. What if he had an emergency secret?</p><br/><p>Who knew? She was overthinking!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless even if you call me your father. I\u2019m full now and I want to sleep.\u201d Han Xiao yawned.</p><br/><p><em>Damn it! You just ate everything I paid for and now you want to go!?</em></p><br/><p>Ning Xi really wished for someone skilled enough to beat Han Xiao up until he vomited out all the food he just ate.</p><br/><p>But it was impossible\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked around and tried to figure out who was following her and why.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not notice anything, but since Han Xiao said so, it must be true.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne more bucket of chickens!\u201d Suddenly, Han Xiao yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo get it and pay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi swore. If this man was not a monster, she would surely fight him.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes, then smiled sweetly. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll pay, but you have to take care of the people following me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust for one chicken bucket?\u201d Han Xiao obviously felt like he was being taken advantage of.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two, alright? I paid for the one before too!\u201d Ning Xi argued.</p><br/><p>\u201cF-Fine\u2026\u201d Han Xiao finally made the tough decision after some struggle.</p><br/><p>After another round of guzzling, Han Xiao took the last chicken drumstick in his hand and left KFC with Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Two men in sunglasses left after they saw Ning Xi move.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi drove the car to the outskirts.</p><br/><p>A four-wheel-drive went in their way and blocked Ning Xi\u2019s car, two middle-aged men alighting from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, follow us.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the slightly chubbier men swiftly went up and caught Ning Xi\u2019s wrist firmly.</p><br/><p>In that brief moment, Ning Xi raised her right arm and pushed the man away.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, don\u2019t cause any trouble. I\u2019m giving you another chance. Follow us or you\u2019ll face the consequences\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a sense of coldness in the chubby man\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stood where she was with a grin. It was an evil little grin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

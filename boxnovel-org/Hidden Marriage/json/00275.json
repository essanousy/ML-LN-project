If only Tingxiao was just getting a wife, that\u2019s fine, but because of Little Treasure, we can\u2019t be hasty about this! Will you be at ease leaving Little Treasure in the hands of that girl?\"</p><br/><p>\"But what Jingli said today makes sense too. That girl might not be as bad as we imagined her to be. Besides, she did teach Little Treasure quite well! Didn\u2019t you yourself say she was doing a good job too?\"</p><br/><p>\"That was because I was fooled by those two punks!\" Father Lu started to become incensed again talking about this. He warned his other half with a stare, \"Don\u2019t you be nice about this, no more further discussions about this! The most important thing you have to do now is to hurry up and choose a suitable wife for Tingxiao. Make him give up on the girl.\"</p><br/><p>\"If you want to choose, you go ahead! My dear grandson is already like this, I\u2019m not in the mood to deal with such nonsense now!\"</p><br/><p>\"What would it look like if I did the choosing?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Whatever it is, I\u2019m not going! I want to accompany my grandson!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Late at night at Dragon Bay</p><br/><p>A group of avant garde fashionable youths gathered together.</p><br/><p>One of them was a black short-haired youth that particularly stood out. His entire face was covered with an exaggerated skull, with a tattoo sleeve on his arm. He had a black coloured earring on his left ear and chewing gum in his mouth, he said to the white haired youth beside him, \"Ah Ka, is my car ready?\"</p><br/><p>Ah Ka tapped the car that was shined to sparkle beside him and said, \"It\u2019s ready, here\u2019s the car! Have a look see if you like it!\"</p><br/><p>The skull-faced youth looked critically at the car, and said stiffly, \"It\u2019s not bad I guess, but it doesn\u2019t have my blackie\u2019s cool factor.\"</p><br/><p>Ah Ka rolled his eyes, \"Please, I can make your car look like this is considered not too shabby in just one day, alright? Right, Xi Zi, where\u2019s your car? Where\u2019s your blackie?\"</p><br/><p>\"I sent it for maintenance, it\u2019s still not done yet,\" slurred the youth lazily. Her car was still with Lu Tingxiao. It was not too convenient to get it now in their current situation, so she had to borrow another one.</p><br/><p>Ah Ka nodded and clapped his hands to get everyone\u2019s attention. \"Everyone\u2019s here, right? Let me reiterate the competition rules! We\u2019ll start here from Dragon Bay, and the destination will be Death Valley. First place gets to have our princess Xiang Xiang for one night of fun!</p><br/><p>The crowd started to cheer loudly.</p><br/><p>A sexy lady with a devilish body stepped out of the crowd to slap the back of Ah Ka\u2019s head. \"Pfft, please! You hooligan! One night of fun, in your dreams!\"</p><br/><p>Despite getting hit, Ah Ka grinned as if he had just swallowed honey. He laughed and said, \"Haha, I was just joking! Let\u2019s start again! The grand prize will be a kiss from our princess! Additionally, there\u2019s a prize money of five million dollars!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

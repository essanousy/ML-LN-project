There was an incoming phone call.</p><br/><p>The caller ID displayed the name: Ning Yaohua\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi narrowed her eyes slightly and walked out to the balcony to take the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of greeting is \u2018hello\u2019?! Don\u2019t you know how to address your father with respect? Where are your manners?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to fight with me over this again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I wish that you weren\u2019t part of the Ning family, but our family\u2019s blood runs through your veins. That\u2019s a fact that I can\u2019t erase! Whatever filthy things you\u2019ve done outside will ultimately bring shame to our Ning family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, the filthy things that I\u2019ve done\u2026 Was that something Ning Xueluo said again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXueluo didn\u2019t even need to bring up something like that. Everyone on the internet is saying that! They\u2019re saying that you\u2019re poisonous and unrepentant and that\u2026 that you\u2019re a kept woman who glorifies her shamelessness and flaunts her filthy deeds in front of everyone!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that I\u2019m accusing you wrongly! I sent someone to wait outside your apartment for quite a few days, but you never returned. Why don\u2019t you tell me where you\u2019ve been staying these past few days? And where did you get that money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Ning Xi. I\u2019m giving you one last chance. Come back right now and apologise to Xueluo! Furthermore, I\u2019ve already arranged a decent job for you at a branch company in Singapore. Your plane tickets have already been booked. Pack your things and leave the day after tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, he had exiled her once five years ago. Five years later, he actually wanted to exile her again\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi emphasised each word as she spoke, \u201cChairman Ning, while I do have the Ning family\u2019s blood running through my veins, aside from contributing a single sperm cell, you\u2019ve never raised me for even a single day. Even if my reputation drops to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, you don\u2019t have the right to criticise me and you have even less of a right to get involved in my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi! How impudent! You had better think hard on the consequences of provoking me! You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately hung up, cutting off the roaring coming from the other end of the phone.</p><br/><p>This time, her heart was strangely tranquil. She wasn\u2019t angry. She wasn\u2019t disappointed. She definitely wasn\u2019t sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2026\u201d A gentle voice suddenly called out to her from nearby.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned her head only to see Lu Tingxiao anxiously looking at her from the neighbouring balcony.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spoke with some surprise, \u201cEh, Lu Tingxiao\u2026 You haven\u2019t slept yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao walked up to the edge of his balcony, on the side closest to hers, \u201cI heard some noises coming from the balcony so I came out to take a look. Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi casually shrugged her shoulders, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Ning Yaohua gives me the same lines every time he calls. I can probably recite it from memory by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao wasn\u2019t very good at comforting others. He reached across the gap between the balconies and rubbed her head, \u201cDon\u2019t feel sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed. Beneath the starlight, her expression was calm and serene. \u201cI\u2019m not sad. In this world, the only ones who can hurt us are the ones that we care about. The more we care about them, the more it hurts. But now, I\u2019m not going to get hurt anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because she didn\u2019t care anymore.</p><br/><p>That time in the hospital was going to be the last time she would feel sad about those people. Never again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! I\u2019m going to bed now! I still have to get up early tomorrow! Good night!\u201d Ning Xi waved at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGetting up early? There\u2019s nothing planned for tomorrow. You can sleep in a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting up early to buy groceries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you buying groceries?\u201d Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo prepare a meal of course! I promised that I would cook for you and Little Treasure last time, but I\u2019ve been postponing it for so long that I still haven\u2019t made one yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just recovered. There\u2019s no hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just buying some groceries and cooking a meal. That\u2019s not tiring at all. Also, I just happen to have some free time tomorrow. Alright, that\u2019s settled! Oh yes, remember to eat less for breakfast tomorrow so you can save some stomach space. I\u2019ll definitely have you two wishing that you had an extra stomach!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao chuckled when he saw her confident expression, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

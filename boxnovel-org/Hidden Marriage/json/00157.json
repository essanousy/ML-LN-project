Impressive, impressive! You\u2019re just a little too wasteful! That vase must have been pretty expensive, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes were cold: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to speak of it, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s head drooped downwards in a disheartened manner, \u201cBut you look like you\u2019re going to break off all ties with me if I don\u2019t confess everything, you\u2019re not being honest at all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Other than confessing everything, was there a second option for her?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed and could only choose to explain the sequence of events to him, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you before that something went wrong with the prop and I accidentally hurt Ning Xueluo? Right now, the prop master is insisting on saying that I bribed him to switch the props. Isn\u2019t that forcing me into a dead end? If he sticks to his confession, it won\u2019t just be my career that will be ruined, I\u2019ll even have to go to jail!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at her calmly, \u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi coughed lightly and stalled, \u201cSo I went to force that guy to speak the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her nonchalant attitude, storm clouds were gathering on Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face, \u201cNing Xi, do you know how dangerous it was for you to do that? As a girl\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi covered her head and said, \u201cI know, I know! But wasn\u2019t I forced into it? You don\u2019t know what that Zhang Qiang is like, he\u2019s a scoundrel! I can only use simple violence to deal with that kind of person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said before that you can look for me if you need any help. You chose to use such a dangerous method, before even coming to ask me for help?\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes were filled with grave disappointment.</p><br/><p>That gaze unexpectedly made her heart clench in pain.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Lu Tingxiao had gotten so angry with her. Ning Xi\u2019s face was full of anxiety, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that! I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, feeling like she was going to have a headache, she sighed, \u201cI\u2019m just used to it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Used to solving everything by herself. Used to not relying on others.</p><br/><p>The two of them sunk into silence again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, but, how did you know that I had a gun on me?\u201d Ning Xi abruptly recalled this matter and asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe smell.\u201d Lu Tingxiao answered coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, so that\u2019s how! Was it the smell of gunpowder? I didn\u2019t realise that even your sense of smell is so strong, Big Boss! Hehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression remained as cold as ice, the kind that had been frozen for a thousand years.</p><br/><p>Her flattery had failed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had an expression of complete helplessness, \u201cLu Tingxiao, it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to ask you for help. There\u2019s just no need for you to personally take action for small matters like these. Isn\u2019t it like using a sledgehammer to kill a fly? However, right now, I do have something that I really, really need your help with! You really have to help me this time, please please please! I kept thinking about it, and you\u2019re the only one I can turn to for this! So even if you\u2019re not willing to help me, I\u2019ll definitely keep disturbing you!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, although his expression remained frosty, he finally looked her in the eye, \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly spoke up, \u201cIt\u2019s like this! Although I finally got Zhang Qiang\u2019s confession, and the emails and bank transfer details from the mastermind, all this evidence can only clear my innocence, but I won\u2019t be able to find the mastermind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be very gentlemanly of me if I didn\u2019t take revenge for this grudge. Letting the mastermind off so easily would be such a waste! So I was thinking, is there any way that you could decode the mastermind\u2019s account details and IP address?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig boss, it must have been thanks to your genes that Darling Little Treasure is already so clever at such a young age! So Big Boss must be even more impressive at computers and such. I\u2019m sure you have some way to do that, right?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

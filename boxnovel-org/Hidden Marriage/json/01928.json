Why hadn\u2019t he known to have a backup!? We\u2019re watching Ning Xi\u2019s votes increase drastically and we can\u2019t do a damned thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan\u2019s rationality and poise could not be maintained anymore. She threw the mineral water bottle at her assistant.</p><br/><p>The assistant\u2019s head became red and swollen from the impact of the bottle. On the side, she said carefully, \u201cThey must have bought votes! Otherwise, how could it have increased so quickly?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though they knew that with Glory World\u2019s capabilities, there was no way they could buy these many votes, yet saying this would still make it easier for them to accept the outcome rather than saying that Han Zixuan\u2019s skills could not compare to Ning Xi\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, quickly call the company!\u201d Han Zixuan cursed under her breath.</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru walked around frantically backstage as she quickly called the Public Relations department and started spluttering into the phone, \u201cLiu Wenliang, quickly think of something for me! We don\u2019t care what method you use! Don\u2019t forget that CEO Wang has told you that this time for the female rankings, the number one must be Zixuan. It can only be Zixuan! You\u2019d better think about the consequences if you make a mistake this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other of the phone, Liu Wenliang was already in terrible shape at the moment. He was frantic as well because he had just been scolded by Wang Haojun and Ning Xueluo. Now, with Zheng Anru\u2019s call, he was enraged.</p><br/><p>\u201cZheng Anru, do you think I\u2019m God? Ning Xi\u2019s just sitting in her guest seat and doing nothing, but her votes keep on rising tremendously. What can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Zheng Anru and Liu Wenliang were arguing on the phone, Zheng Anru saw that Ning Xi\u2019s votes in both categories had suddenly decelerated. There were even signs of it slowly stopping.</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru was suddenly overjoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s stopping, it\u2019s stopping. I knew it! It\u2019s finally reached its peak! Liu Wenliang, quickly seize the opportunity and step things up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Wenliang obviously noticed this too, but he instantly grumbled, \u201cStep things up, my ass! Do you think we can surpass her just like that? Look at the margin of the votes right now! Even if it\u2019s stopped, there\u2019s no way we can surpass her either!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to know that those number of votes were pulled in six whole days! Now, in such a short amount of time, there\u2019s no way we could pull so many votes! Instead of nitpicking at me, why don\u2019t you let Zixuan think of a way to make her fans vote for her. That\u2019d be faster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru looked at Han Zixuan and her expression was dark. In such a short amount of time, what could she think of?</p><br/><p>Even that shocking performance earlier was useless!</p><br/><p>Should she ask for the organizers to give her another slot?</p><br/><p>Just as Zheng Anru was haggling and arguing with Liu Wenliang\u2026</p><br/><p>On the side, the assistant stared at the huge screen and suddenly covered her mouth. She cried out in alarm, \u201cAh\u2026 Oh my God! What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you making a big fuss about?\u201d Zheng Anru scowled impatiently.</p><br/><p>The assistant pointed at the numbers and said emotionally, \u201cSis Anru, look at the male artiste list! How did Ning Xi\u2019s name suddenly appear on the male artiste ranks? Could there be a problem with the system?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru suddenly could not care about Liu Wenliang on the phone. She quickly went over to look and indeed, Ning Xi\u2019s name was really on the male list!</p><br/><p>Most Popular Male Artiste No. 10: Ning Xi!</p><br/><p>National Male Idol No. 9: Ning Xi!</p><br/><p>Most Desired Male Artiste To Sleep With No. 7: Ning Xi!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

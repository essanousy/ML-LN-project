More importantly, it was no weaker than their organization...</p><br/><p>\"This cannot continue, I'm going to rescue Bro Xi! Only Bro Xi can stop this now!\" Annie cried out.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao stopped Annie. \"What can you do!? You're not a fighter, you can't even lift the door. Just stay here, I'll go!\"</p><br/><p>\"But, if the Boss blames us...\" Annie was worried.</p><br/><p>\"Both of you are directly under him. Of course, you two can't go. Even though I'm part of the Organization, I'm just sort of a part-timer here. I'd still have 'The Sins' behind me if I were to get in trouble! Don't worry! \"Feng Xiaoxiao then swiftly went into the house.</p><br/><p>The Sins was the largest assassin group internationally. While Feng Xiaoxiao worked with the Organization, she was also a core member of The Sins.</p><br/><p>Tang Ye did not stop Feng Xiaoxiao and just acted as if he did not see what just happened.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>In the creepiest master bedroom upstairs, as Feng Xiaoxiao went into the room using a metal key, Ning Xi was still battling with the glass window.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held a small, sharp bone in her hand and was trying to break the window with it when suddenly someone grabbed her by her shirt and pulled her away from the window.</p><br/><p>A black boot flew across the room...</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>There was a loud sound and the window was broken...</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was dumbfounded. The window she had been trying to break for so long was now shattered into pieces. She cried, \"Oh! Third Senior Sister! You finally came!\"</p><br/><p>\"Useless!\" Feng Xiaoxiao rolled her eyes at her as she took out a dagger and cut open the ropes that bound Ning Xi's hands. \"I've already reminded you the last time! How are you getting weaker and weaker?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pouted and mumbled, \"It just shows how carefree and happy my life is now ...\"</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao was annoyed by her comment. \"Are you flaunting your lovey-dovey experience in front of me? I'm going to kick you!\"</p><br/><p>\"You wouldn't!\" Ning Xi went up to her and gave her a big hug.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao closed her eyes when she saw this underaged-looking girl acting so innocently in this situation. \"No wonder 16 looked defeated just now. Her wonderful image of you must've been shattered!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked her eyes. \"16? Who's number 16?\"</p><br/><p>\"Her code name is 16! The woman who kidnapped you here!\" Feng Xiaoxiao replied.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, that's who she is... She will probably experience some mental breakdown today...\" Ning Xi started perspiring guiltily</p><br/><p>\"She seemed to have a crush on you before. She probably volunteered for Feng Jin's mission because she wanted to get closer to her idol but who knew...\" Feng Xiaoxiao felt bad for 16.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi mumbled, \"So, it's my fault now? She's the one who tied me up and left me all alone here! It's karma!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

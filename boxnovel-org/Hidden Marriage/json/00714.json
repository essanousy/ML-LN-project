Hu Hongda has lost all his pride and dignity by hosting this press conference! No matter how powerful Ning Xi is, she could never have made Hu Hongda do this!\"</p><br/><p>\"Then, why did he?\" Fang Ya was lost like a little lamb.</p><br/><p>\"Could Ming Fangfang have realized the truth and forced him to do so?\" Ning Xueluo thought about the possibility of it. Although the logic of such a situation was weak, Ning Xueluo could not think of anything else.</p><br/><p>\"Then...then, what should I do? Xueluo, you cannot leave me alone! I\u2019m really done for!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo felt disgusted with her and wanted to abandon her right away, but she was afraid that Fang Ya might try to destroy her reputation in the aftermath. \"Since you\u2019re at this stage and you can't contact him, go straight to his house. Even if he doesn\u2019t care about you, his parents would not be so heartless!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re right! How could I not have thought of this?! After all, I\u2019m still bearing his child! His mother is crazy about wanting a grandchild!\" Fang Ya\u2019s eyes were full of hope.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the evening, at the entrance of the Hu residence.</p><br/><p>\"Madam, you can\u2019t leave!\"</p><br/><p>\"Fangfang, what are you doing? Let\u2019s talk this out!\"</p><br/><p>\"My dear, please don\u2019t leave me, please! Forgive me once again, I\u2019ll do whatever you want!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ming Fangfang looked at the man she once loved, and then at her mother-in-law whom she had been treating like her real mother. \"Mother, I\u2019m not looking for trouble, I\u2019m just really tired. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve decided to divorce Hongda!\"</p><br/><p>\"Fangfang, are you only going to change your mind if I kneel down in front of you?\" Madam Elder Hu started to kneel.</p><br/><p>Ming Fangfang quickly stopped her. \"Mother, stop! I can't take this!\"</p><br/><p>Madam Elder Hu slapped Hu Honda. \"Bastard, kneel down to Fangfang now!\"</p><br/><p>Hu Hongda knelt down instantly, his head hanging low. \"My dear, if you don\u2019t forgive me, then I\u2019ll kneel here forever! I\u2019ve realized my mistake now. I can\u2019t live without you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Fangfang! Please give Hongda another chance! If he makes a mistake again, I\u2019ll not let him get away with it!\"</p><br/><p>Although she knew that they were acting desperate for the benefit of the company and that they urgently needed help from the Ming family, they had been married for so many years after all and she could not let him go\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ming Fangfang was struggling to decide. \"Mother, I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Maybe after this incident, he would really change. He was the man she chose after all\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a woman\u2019s voice called out from the back, \"Hongda!\"</p><br/><p>Ming Fangfang turned around, her face draining of all color. Fang Ya\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing how Ming Fangfang was about to change her mind and Fang Ya suddenly appearing, Hu Hongda really wanted to kill his mistress. He went up to her angrily and raised his hand, trembling in anger. \"Who let you come here?!\"</p><br/><p>Fang Ya was not afraid at all as she stepped forward. \"Hit me! Hit me hard! Kill me along with the baby in my womb! I have nowhere to go now, I don\u2019t mind dying! I just feel sorry for my child. Our child, abandoned before it is even born! Abandoned by its own father!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

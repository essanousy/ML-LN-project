There were no traces of the Ning Xi he knew, as if she was just another stranger.</p><br/><p>But he knew\u2026</p><br/><p>That girl was still Ning Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>It was the past version of her\u2026</p><br/><p>But when he saw her going up to him happily and pitifully tell him how scared she was, he knew that she was still the girl whom he knew.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned back and her eyes met with Lu Tingxiao\u2019s. She gulped, \"Uh, Boss...why are you looking at me...are you trying to get back at me now? You said that you wouldn\u2019t be angry with me anymore!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao reined in his thoughts and said kindly, \"I still have something else to handle in Philadelphia. Do you want to go back first or are you leaving with me later on?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied after she had given it some thought, \"I\u2019ll go back with you!\"</p><br/><p>She then explained, \"Well, I don\u2019t really have any work these few days and it\u2019s such a rare occasion that I can get out of the country. I guess I\u2019ll take this chance to have a short vacation!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at her solemnly and said in a slightly colder tone than usual, \"If you\u2019re leaving together with me, you\u2019re going to stay within my sight for the next few days.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" Ning Xi looked troubled, \"Then wouldn\u2019t I be bored to death?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face suddenly darkened.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly rephrased, \"No, no, no! How would I be bored when I\u2019m with you, Boss?! It\u2019s a great honor to be able to stay by your honor\u2019s side\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At the back of the car, Xiong Zhi coughed lightly and with a low voice he said, \"Ms. Ning Xi...is she schizophrenic?\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xiao rolled his eyes at him, \"Screw that schizophrenic crap! Don\u2019t you see now? She was taking Boss on a ride all along!\"</p><br/><p>\"So she was just acting around Boss?\" Xiong Zhi was still confused, \"Then how do you explain Boss\u2019 attitude towards Ms. Ning Xi?\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xiao had no comeback for this one, so he mumbled, \"How would I know? I was terrified!\" After all, he almost thought that his boss who had appeared just now was an imposter.</p><br/><p>Cheng Feng who was listening to their conversation while working on the documents the whole time could not hold it in anymore, \"What would you single dudes know? It\u2019s the power of love!\"</p><br/><p>They finally reached a safe area.</p><br/><p>In the hotel, Lu Tingxiao brought her directly into his room.</p><br/><p>He led her to sit on the sofa then proceeded to the balcony to make a phone call.</p><br/><p>A while later, Cheng Feng brought Ning Xi a PSP game console, a few fashion magazines, and some snacks.</p><br/><p>After he had settled Ning Xi down, Lu Tingxiao gathered his men for a meeting. Through a window from the meeting room, he could see Ning Xi in the living room.</p><br/><p>He literally was not going to leave her out of his sight...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

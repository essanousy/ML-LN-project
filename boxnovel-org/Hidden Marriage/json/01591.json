You're only my sister-in-law! No one else's! Your roasted pork ribs and sweet and sour fish are mine and mine alone! You cannot be anyone else's sister-in-law! Never!\"</p><br/><p>\"Uhh\u2026\" Anyone else's sister-in-law?</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi imagined someone calling her sister-in-law, goosebumps rose all over her!</p><br/><p>\"Lu Jingli! That's enough! Get up and stop yelling! Where's your brother?\" Ning Xi could not stand it anymore and stopped him.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli stood up aggrievedly. \"He's still in a meeting. The senior management meeting just finished. Now, he's holding a meeting with the stakeholders. It'll probably take some time... I'm about to go to the hospital to visit my father. Sister-in-law, did you find out what happened at the dinner?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, Jiang Muye told me about it.\" Ning Xi's expression darkened slightly, then she asked, \"Is it okay if I wait for him upstairs?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli then mumbled, \"It'll be okay even if you waited for him in the meeting room! Let me make a call. I'll get the secretary to lead you into his office!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After she went into the building, a secretary welcomed her and brought her right into Lu Tingxiao's office.</p><br/><p>\"Madam, the CEO is still in a meeting. Please wait for a while.\" The secretary served Ning Xi with a smile and even directly addressed her as \"Madam\".</p><br/><p>The Second Master had mentioned that it was his sister-in-law on the call, so she should be the rumored genuine girlfriend of the CEO!</p><br/><p>Of course, she would need to seize this chance after all those wasted efforts on the fake girlfriends\u2026</p><br/><p>\"It's alright. It's no issue.\"</p><br/><p>\"Madam, what would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, or juice?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll have some juice.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I'll get it for you!\"</p><br/><p>Although the woman on the sofa was wearing sunglasses and a face mask, judging by her appearance and jawline, she must be a real beauty!</p><br/><p>While the secretary was really curious about her real identity, she did not want to make her unhappy, she quickly retreated after a short glance.</p><br/><p>Soon, the secretary returned with a glass of juice.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thanked her and continued waiting, but because she was too tired from the continuous script reading, she could not help it and fell asleep on the sofa...</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lu Tingxiao had finally finished another long meeting. Several stakeholders trailed behind him towards his office. They seemed to have several other matters to talk about.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao opened the door into his office and the others went in as well. Then, everyone saw that lying on the sofa in the CEO's office was a girl! Everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was slightly taken aback in surprise when he saw the girl on the sofa. Seconds later, his expression was like a melting frozen mountain, the aloof vibes of his vanishing.</p><br/><p>\"You guys can go back first. We'll talk later,\" Lu Tingxiao spoke to the stakeholders in a low voice. He then went up to the girl a little unhappily and frowned as he covered the girl with a blanket.</p><br/><p>The stakeholders nodded as they were leaving, but they glanced back after a few steps. Though, they could not see anything because Lu Tingxiao blocked their view\u2026</p><br/><p>Was that the rumored Lady Boss everyone was talking about!?</p><br/><p>What a stingy boss! He could have let them at least take a look\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He asked with a warm tone, \u201cDid I wake you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at the man before her, her eyes as wide as saucers.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was not wearing a shirt. So the moment she had pushed the door open, her view had been filled with bare skin. The impact was too much.</p><br/><p>She rubbed her nose, luckily she had not done anything embarrassing.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao seemed not to have noticed her abnormal expression. Instead he calmly picked up his shirt from the sofa to wear. He said while buttoning up his shirt: \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency at work, I have to leave now. Could I trouble you to wake Little Treasure up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay!\u201d Ning Xi nodded as she hurried to call for Little Treasure.</p><br/><p>In the end, she didn\u2019t have to call for him. She saw a soft, moe, and impossibly cute Pikachu the moment she turned around. It was staring straight at his dear father, Lu Tingxiao, without blinking. His expression was clearly unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Treasure, go and change your clothes.\u201d Lu Tingxiao put on his coat and ordered his son.</p><br/><p>The reaction he got was a \u2018Bang!\u2019 as the bedroom door was shut.</p><br/><p>Completely ruthless.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao tried the door and found that the door was locked from the inside.</p><br/><p>He looked towards Ning Xi, \u201cDo you have the key?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi awkwardly shook her head, \u201cI do, but it\u2019s inside the room!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pinched his brow as he spoke in a cold tone, \u201cLu Qingyu, I\u2019m giving you three minutes. Don\u2019t think of ever coming back here if you don\u2019t come out by then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not a single peep sounded from inside after three minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Qingyu, come out! If you\u2019re going to wait for me to force you out, then I won\u2019t be this easy to speak with!\u201d</p><br/><p>Still no movement.</p><br/><p>A certain little bun was not leaving a shred of dignity for his father.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was watching from the side and holding back the urge to laugh, \u201cI only have to go to work later, why not let Little Treasure stay here for a while longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face was black as he pulled out his cellphone to make a call.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi secretly glanced at him and found that he was calling a psychiatrist. She was speechless for a moment. He was calling a psychiatrist for something as small as this? Wasn\u2019t it making a mountain out of a molehill?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi coughed lightly and suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao hesitated for a moment, then nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi leaned on the door and tried to put on a soft tone, \u201cLittle Treasure, auntie has to go to work later on. I can\u2019t take care of you, could you go home with daddy first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Still no response from inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this, let\u2019s exchange phone numbers so we can contact each other at any time. We can also video call!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of wavering footsteps sounded from inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe director will scold me if auntie is late. Our director is really fierce, auntie is so pitiful wuuuuuu\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had been prepared to wage a long war. Thus a trace of astonishment flashed across his eyes. He looked at the woman next to him with a complicated gaze.</p><br/><p>She could actually persuade Little Treasure to come out obediently with just three sentences.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure had locked himself up in the attic at home the last time this had happened. Their family of four, all the butlers and maids, the psychiatrist and even a negotiation expert had been deployed. They could only tear down the door in the end despite talking till their lips were dry for the entire afternoon. The end result was the little guy ignoring them for an entire month.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not know of that incident. Of course, she only thought that this child was too obedient. She picked up the little bun. He was miserable yet had still come out because he could not bear the thought of her getting scolded. She praised, \u201cLittle Treasure is so obedient, thank you darling!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun who was praised had his mood raised. He silently handed her a piece of paper with a string of numbers on it.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi received the note, \u201cEh? Is this your phone number? Great, I\u2019ll save it. I\u2019ll definitely call you once I\u2019m free!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao thought something was strange. Little Treasure did not have a phone, so where did he get that phone number?</p><br/><p>He glanced over borrowing his height advantage- it was his phone number.</p><br/><p>Not bad, as expected of his son!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What if they were really randomly picked?</p><br/><p>In a certain corner, Jiang Muye's manager, Lei Ming, was anxiously making a call. \"My prince, the CEO is here and CEO Lu is on the way too. Why aren't you here yet?\"</p><br/><p>From the other end came Jiang Muye's annoying voice. \"Who said I was coming?\"</p><br/><p>Lei Ming was so fed up with him. \"Today is such a huge occasion and you're not coming? What are you doing then? Did some emergency happen?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye replied, \"I'm playing video games.\"</p><br/><p>\"...Muye, I'll beg you then! Even if you just show your face and then leave, it's fine! It'll just take up one hour of game time!\"</p><br/><p>\"I already said I'm not going,\" said Jiang Muye, annoyed as he hung up.</p><br/><p>Hmm, no way I'm going. I'll definitely be attacked by PDA...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Offstage, after Lu Jingli finished speaking, Liang Biqin looked starry-eyed as she held Su Yimo's arm excitedly. \"Cousin, I didn't know CEO Lu was this romantic!\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Meixin looked delighted as well, her gaze towards Ling Zhizhi full of mockery.</p><br/><p>As long as Su Yimo was here, she would be Glory World Entertainment's number one manager forever. It was useless even if Ling Zhizhi discovered great new talents!</p><br/><p>Su Yimo looked longingly at the door as she muttered, \"It's just a random pick. Who knows who'll get picked?!\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Meixin smiled, \"Yimo, CEO Lu had prepared everyting tonight especially for you, how could it be anyone else if not you.</p><br/><p>Su Yimo checked her makeup nervously. \"Sis Xin, do I look okay? Do I look fine?\"</p><br/><p>\"All's fine! You're so beautiful! CEO Lu would definitely fall for you! CEO Lu has done so much for you, this friendship is remarkable!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The celebration event continued ardently.</p><br/><p>However, everyone's attention was obviously distracted to focus on the person who was about to arrive.</p><br/><p>Time passed slowly. Lu Tingxiao still had not appeared, causing many people to whisper.</p><br/><p>\"Why hasn't he come!? Could it be that he's not coming anymore?\"</p><br/><p>\"CEO Lu is quite busy after all. I heard that he's just flown in from work overseas. He's rushing over right after landing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Does CEO Lu really value tonight's celebration so much?\"</p><br/><p>\"He probably values a certain person...\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>As they waited worriedly, the Vice President Yi Xudong received a phone call. \"What? He's here? Good, good! Got it!\"</p><br/><p>Yi Xudong hung up with a wide smile on his face, then he ran to the door. Glory World Entertainment's shareholders and management team followed after.</p><br/><p>Outside the entrance, a low-profile black Maybach stopped quietly.</p><br/><p>With Yi Xudong as the lead, the management stood in two organized lines and waited outside the car.</p><br/><p>The driver got out of the car to pull open the door as a pair of long legs stepped out.</p><br/><p>The man wore a neat black formal outfit. Without any expression on him, he exuded the prestige of a leader. He was very handsome as if he was God's most meticulously sculpted work, but his presence overpowered his looks.</p><br/><p>Yi Xudong walked up to greet him humbly, \"CEO...CEO Lu! You're here! Come in!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

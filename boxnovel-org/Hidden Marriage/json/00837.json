Influential enough for Yan Ruyi and Lu Chongshan to acknowledge her even though it was obvious that they did not like her.</p><br/><p>She was just a petty actress, so how could she be capable of being close to Little Treasure?</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao had already investigated. Even one of the most capable psychiatrists in the country could not do anything about Little Treasure\u2026</p><br/><p>---</p><br/><p>At the same time, in Spirit Studio.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi dropped by the studio after attending an event.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze, Han Momo, and Qiao Weilan were working hard. After Ning Xi greeted them, she summoned Gong Shangze alone to her office.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, what\u2019s up?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded and looked at him. \"Tell me what you think about Director Qiao.\"</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze looked hesitant., \"The truth?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed. \"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright\u2026\" Gong Shangze cleared his throat. \"I\u2019ll start with her personality. She\u2019s a pretty cold person, so we dare not to talk to her any more than necessary. But her abilities are top notch. Tasks that might take us a few days to finish can be completed by her in an instant. Our efficiency has increased sharply in the few days that she\u2019s been here. In fact, we\u2019re almost done with the orders we received after Fashion Week!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze hesitated again, \"But\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"But what?\"</p><br/><p>\u2018But...how do I put it? I can feel that her focus isn\u2019t here. She does not proactively do anything else here aside from what she\u2019s been assigned to,\" Gong Shangze replied honestly.</p><br/><p>It was just as Ning Xi expected. \"It\u2019s already a blessing to have her with us here.\"</p><br/><p>She had suddenly been transferred here, and to her, it was just a mission from Qin Shengyue. She probably just hoped that she would commit no mistakes, and that she would not do things that were outside her job scope. Once the time was up, she would leave.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, I got the big picture. Anyhow, Qiao Weilan\u2019s arrival has been a big help to us, so be nice to her. As for the studio, we need to improve on our own, we can\u2019t always rely on her,\" Ning Xi said.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze replied, \"Understood, Boss.\"</p><br/><p>As they were talking, Ning Xi\u2019s phone suddenly rang. It was Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, her powerful aura faded and she turned gentle and sweet.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze instantly knew who was calling. \"Boss, if there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll get back to work!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright then!\"</p><br/><p>After Gong Shangze went out, Ning Xi picked up her phone. \"Hey, Boss, what\u2019s the matter?\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing?\" Lu Tingxiao asked her gently.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m in the studio, just checking on the progress.\"</p><br/><p>\"If you\u2019re not very busy, could you come by the Lu residence?\" Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not that busy...but why so sudden? Isn\u2019t today your father\u2019s birthday?\" Ning Xi frowned and realized that something was not right. \"Did something happen to Little Treasure?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

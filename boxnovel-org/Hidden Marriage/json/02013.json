She scanned through them with her cold eyes, and the voices lowered down a little. Ning Xi then said, \u201cToday is the charity dinner organized by LA. It\u2019s not my personal press conference. If there are any questions, I\u2019ll answer them after the event is over. Now, please don\u2019t disrupt the event. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people around were disappointed when they heard Ning Xi\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s well-rounded answer made the reporters speechless, but they had to back down for now.</p><br/><p>She had promised to give them answers after the event anyway. They would never let this chance go.</p><br/><p>When they saw Ning Xi delay the issue, the ladies around Han Zixuan started mocking her. \u201cShe\u2019s still trying to act tough at this moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d really like to see what she\u2019s going to say after the event ends!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe proof is solid. She can\u2019t twist the truth that she destroyed a loving family and bullied a pregnant woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGood evening, dear guests. The annual LA charity dinner is officially starting now. To kick off, we have our most anticipated auction.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the host\u2019s opening speech, the auction started swiftly.</p><br/><p>Usually, the atmosphere was lively in this section, but today everyone could only focus on one person.</p><br/><p>In the first row, Ning Xi concentrated on listening to the auctioneer\u2019s explanation. She chatted with her manager and raised her tag to bid from time to time.</p><br/><p>Her relaxed aura did not appear like she was just involved in such a big scandal or that she might be cut off from the industry after tonight.</p><br/><p>In the corner, Han Zixian took a glance at Ning Xi\u2019s direction and she frowned a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould she have something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>If not, why was she so calm about this?</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru scoffed, \u201cImpossible! Ning Xueluo said the words herself, and there\u2019s even proof of it. If she really had a solution, she\u2019d have used it by now. Why would she wait?</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom my experience, her appearance today must be Xu Tao\u2019s last trump. He probably hasn\u2019t given up yet. Firstly, he wants to test the reaction of the media. Secondly, he wants to create a better image for her by getting her to attend a charity event! I know all about his cheap tricks!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow naive! He thought he\u2019s a manager that can turn the world around. It might work if it were some other scandal, but cheating, drugs, and politics are the three dead zones. There\u2019s no chance for her to turn around now! Don\u2019t worry about it, Zixuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan acted indifferently after that.</p><br/><p>She had nothing to worry about. If there was anything, she should worry about Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was so cool probably because Su Yan had promised her something in private. Maybe, she could just go to Su Yan after her career was finished.</p><br/><p>Now that the whole matter was released to the public, her reputation was ruined and she could no longer work in the entertainment industry. Even if Su Yan was in love with her, would the Su family take her in?</p><br/><p>Moreover, there was still Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>Without even doing anything, the Su family and Ning Xueluo would never let her go!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yin Youyou was sitting right beside Han Zixuan, and she totally agreed with Zheng Anru\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis Anru\u2019s right, Zixuan. Ning Xi\u2019s over this time!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>And then\u2026 it will be your turn, Han Zixuan!</em></p><br/><p>She was really looking forward to seeing the fierce, bloody dogfight between Ning Xi and Han Zixuan.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Running low on sleep</p><br/><p>Translator: Akari, Blaze</p><br/><p>Editor: cfadmode</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi heard what she said, her eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>This was not her first time hearing from other people that Lin Zhizhi hated this type of artist.</p><br/><p>To say that she did not mind it at all, that was definitely impossible.</p><br/><p>After all, she would be the one to fight alongside with her. But if they have incompatible ideas from the start, then how would they be able to continue working together?</p><br/><p>Lin Zhizhi naturally noticed the flash of worry in Ning Xi\u2019s eyes. She looked at Zhao Meixin and unhurriedly spoke, \u201cSister Meixin seems to be misunderstanding something. We all know that in this line of work, being good looking is a gift from the heavens that few can boast of. So why should I hate them?</p><br/><p>What I hate is when the person only have good looks but no skills and no personality, just like a flower vase. Love for beauty is common for all. I do believe that Sister Meixin should understand it the most?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this last sentence, Zhao Meixin\u2019s expression changed immediately. What she understood the most?</p><br/><p>This was clearly mocking her!</p><br/><p>She was originally an actor, because it was difficult to succeed, she mainly focused on her image, often with cosmetic procedures\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Damn Lin Zhizhi. She usually did not speak, but when she did her words really stung! Honestly, it is true that barking dogs seldom bite!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think she is not just a vase?\u201d Zhao Meixin asked sneering again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes and no. It\u2019s better to speak with work rather than words as Sister Meixin is drawing a conclusion based on appearance.\u201d Lin ZhiZhi finished and walked past her to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Meixin was left stuttering and angry behind them.</p><br/><p>After that brief confrontation, Ning Xi\u2019s depression was swept away, and she cheerfully followed behind Lin Zhizhi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Zhizhi, you were so cool ah! I felt so secure! But you can rest assured, that I am certainly not a vase. Even if I were a vase, I am at least the Qing Emperor Qinglong. Blue and white porcelain sea dragon with clouds! Allowing beauty and strength to coexist!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Zhizhi looked at her, her lips imperceptibly hooked upwards, \u201cActions speak louder than words. Filming will start tomorrow, at that time, I will be accompanying you there.</p><br/><p>Also, tomorrow it won\u2019t be just me. The crew is also opening up to allow the media onto the set. At that time, there will be a lot of journalists coming over to you. You\u2019ve been sent the latest script and the shooting schedule. You know that the highlight of the day will be a test of your acting. This will be your first battle, and we must properly prepare!\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, these few days, she had been studying Ning Xi\u2019s resume and viewing some of her previous work. She found out that the girl\u2019s acting was really good, so now she was just waiting for tomorrow\u2019s scene\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I will definitely give a good performance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi said as she secretly looked at Lin Zhizhi. She grew more and more sympathize with her. How could a woman like Lin Zhizhi fancy Jiang Muye, that unreliable and playboy Golden Hair?</p><br/><p>Because Lin Zhizhi was busy with other things, Ning Xi was accompanied by Xiao Tao.</p><br/><p>Xiao Tao was very lively, talking non-stop along the way. Ning Xi heard a lot of company secrets and gossip from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, since Sister Manyun left, the ones who were most pleased were Zhao Meixin and Su Yi Mo, as they no longer had any rival! Although Su Yi Mo\u2019s popularity was higher than Leng Manyun, it was all because she did a lot of junk commercial films. Man Yun\u2019s films, although they were mostly art films, they had won many international awards. Her influence were way better than her okay? But we couldn\u2019t do anything about it, because she has a very strong backing! Her skills were clearly not enough but yet she shamelessly occupy Golden Age\u2019s Big Sister position!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yi Mo\u2019s has a strong backing?\u201d Ning Xi asked</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Sister Xi, you don\u2019t know?\u201d Xiao Tao asked with a look of surprise. Then she conspiringly leaned towards Ning Xi\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cSu Yi Mo\u2019s backing ah\u2026\u2026it\u2019s President Lu!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

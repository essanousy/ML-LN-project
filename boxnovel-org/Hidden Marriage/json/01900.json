Her fair skin had vapors of sweet warmth above it and was looking flushed like the flower petals as she moved along with the man\u2019s gyrations. Her undulations created a strong contrast with the tough and warm body in front of her\u2026</p><br/><p>There was no repellence, no fear, no chaos\u2026</p><br/><p>There were no traumatic feelings\u2026</p><br/><p>Only the giving of each other\u2026</p><br/><p>She felt fulfillment in her heart\u2026</p><br/><p>Sex could feel this good and this pure\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had been holding it in for far too long. He had always been afraid of hurting the girl, but when he finally got to do it with her, the words \u201creserve\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d were alien to him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lu Tingxiao thought of something and his expression changed. He then stopped his motions.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi fixed her messy hair and looked at the man\u2019s painful expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s gentle voice and her clear eyes made it all the worse. Lu Tingxiao\u2019s body stretched tightly like a bow as sweat beaded all over his forehead. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t have it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? What is it?\u201d Ning Xi then quickly understood. She grinned and put her arms around the man\u2019s neck. \u201cMmm\u2026 Darling\u2026 you mean, condoms?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded with a darkened expression. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nuzzled the man\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s safe today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She then looked into the man\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cActually, Darling, I want to have a child with you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard the girl say that she wanted to have a baby with him, at the nearly exact moment, the man\u2019s pupils shrunk and he felt a warm current flow down his spine. Then, it just came out\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Lu Tingxiao cursed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi trembled at the heat she felt within her. She laughed when she heard the man\u2019s regretful cursing.</p><br/><p><em>Please, it was almost morning now!</em></p><br/><p><em>This body of mine is at its limit! How long did you want it to last?</em></p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not pull out. He hugged the girl\u2019s body tightly. \u201cXiao Xi, are\u2026 are you sure you want to?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was worried that what happened back then had caused trauma to her, so he never thought she would be willing to get pregnant again. He also never mentioned such questions in front of her before\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi seemed at peace as she smiled. \u201cOf course, please. We\u2019re already married, so what\u2019s wrong with me having your baby?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly thought about something and worry filled her face. \u201cHmm\u2026 but\u2026 I\u2019m afraid Little Treasure might not like it. Actually, I\u2019m contented enough with Little Treasure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She said what she had just now because that was how she felt. She thought that the most straightforward way to express her feelings to him was to have a baby with him.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes lit up when he heard the girl\u2019s words. He said with firm determination, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Little Treasure will like it, I guarantee.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

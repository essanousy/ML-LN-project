Do you know how important the polls this time are for your comeback? Do you want to be stomped all over by that cheap counterfeit, Han Zixuan?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you putting in more effort?! Pull up your votes!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, it\u2019s not about quality goods not needing advertising. If you don\u2019t announce or promote yourself, nothing will happen. Who will care about you?! You need to change your bad habit of only knowing how to immerse yourself in acting! Didn\u2019t Xu Tao teach you? Make an unreasonable scene, roll about, and act cute. Do one of each! If you really can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could not help but giggle. \u201cIf I really can\u2019t\u2026 should I post nudes like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye instantly jumped up in horror. \u201cOf course not! I\u2019m a man, so it\u2019s fine. Later on, I\u2019ll just post half a nude and muddle my way through. You can\u2019t! In their dreams! I\u2019m saying that if you really can\u2019t, just pretend to be gentle and act coquettishly. All men are into that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d be into that too, Senior Jiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying most of the men! Most!\u201d Jiang Muye shouted defensively, then he unhappily scoffed, \u201cWhat are you laughing for? This is a very serious, very proper matter. What happened to our agreement of slaying the polls together?! I\u2019ve finally become serious this time. Don\u2019t you let me down at such a crucial moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to reach the top with her\u2026 To slay the polls together\u2026</p><br/><p>If it was just him alone, then that would be meaningless!</p><br/><p>Having seen how Jiang Muye was finally serious and energetic to win, Ning Xi was more or less infected too. Even Jiang Muye was taking things seriously, so how could she slack off?</p><br/><p>She would not back down then. Since she was already back in the game, she obviously would give it her all.</p><br/><p>Moments later, from the other end of the phone came the girl\u2019s voice feigning nonchalance, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Senior Jiang. I\u2019m slaying the polls this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though she sounded at ease, it made Jiang Muye\u2019s heart intensely pulse for a moment. Indescribably and without reason, he believed her. He believed that she could really do it.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Muye still miscalculated\u2026</p><br/><p>He never would have thought that\u2026 Ning Xi\u2019s so-called poll slaying\u2026 would mercilessly include slaying him too\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In Deer Town.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not quite understand matters of the entertainment industry, especially with all the rankings. However, because of Ning Xi, he still systematically understood it and knew that this poll was very important to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Lu Tingxiao walked over to the girl.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi heard him, she turned around and kissed Lu Tingxiao on the chin, then she smiled. \u201cNo need. Don\u2019t use a sledgehammer on a nut!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could she bother her darling to handle people of those level?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao saw the familiar bright radiance with three parts arrogance and seven parts ease in her eyes. His pupils abruptly shrunk and the temperature of his blood instantly started to rise.</p><br/><p>Once some things had its gates opened, it would be incredibly hard to continue controlling it.</p><br/><p>Her one meaningful glance and her subtle expression were enough to break the self-constraint that he took pride in, pulverizing it into nothing\u2026</p><br/><p>When he realized it, he had already leaned over and kissed the girl\u2019s sweet lips that were as soft as a newly bloomed flower petal.</p><br/><p>When he suddenly kissed her mid-speech, Ning Xi blinked, perplexed, but very soon she accepted this kiss that came without a warning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re done being busy, I want to bring you somewhere,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Oh, did her Darling actually want to bring her to play?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately nodded with anticipation. She had even more motivation to work now. \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She offered to be Ning Xi\u2019s exclusive makeup artist when she found out that a Chinese was going to be the lead character.</p><br/><p>She lay out all her makeup on the table, yet she did not do anything for some time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLisa, what\u2019s the issue?\u201d Ning Xi was confused.</p><br/><p>Lisa looked surprised. \u201cMs. Ning Xi, in 17 years of my career, I\u2019ve never seen anyone with skin as good as yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>The light makeup on Ning Xi right now was already perfect. There was nothing more to be done.</p><br/><p>The makeup needed for the main character in the movie was not much. She just needed a style that was clean and simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Ning Xi humbly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Ning Xi, I think\u2026 you don\u2019t need any more makeup.\u201d Lisa seemed disappointed as she was keen to show off her skills. In the end, she just did some minor touch-ups.</p><br/><p>Several other makeup artists looked at Ning Xi\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how good her skin is. Is there a problem with her eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how amazing her skin is, can she be better than Caucasians?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two dark-skinned girls stared at Ning Xi unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore them! They\u2019re being discriminated against themselves, yet they want to mock other people to feel better!\u201d Lisa comforted Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled and did not mind.</p><br/><p>Lisa, on the other hand, had seen too many situations like this.</p><br/><p>It was not just actors from China. Many big shots from other countries would be discriminated the moment they were involved in Hollywood.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ning Xi\u2019s case of snatching the lead role had never happened before, so it was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Lisa had heard some rumors from the crew.</p><br/><p>The initial decision was not to have Ning Xi as the female lead, but for some unknown reason, the production team decided to change at the very last minute.</p><br/><p>\u201cLilian, you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two dark-skinned girls looked cheerfully at the girl coming in.</p><br/><p>A Caucasian came into the dressing room with her assistant.</p><br/><p>Lilian was incensed when she found out her role was replaced, especially when she knew that her replacement was a Chinese actress.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were filled with a hint of darkness when she saw Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here and sit, Lilian.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the dark-skinned girls quickly stood up and left the seat for her.</p><br/><p>Lilian\u2019s assistant glanced at Ning Xi and frowned. \u201cWho is this minor actress? Is just anyone allowed in the dressing room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Ms. Ning Xi, the female lead of this movie,\u201d Lisa said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi? Who\u2019s that? I\u2019ve never heard of her before. Anyone heard of her before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lilian\u2019s assistant gave everyone around her a warning glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, who\u2019s that? Never heard of that name before!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould she the female lead spot by sleeping with some higher-ups? I know there are a lot of dirty deals going around in the Chinese entertainment industry!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two girls laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop saying such ridiculous things! Didn\u2019t your parents teach you any manners?\u201d Lisa stared at the girls and warned them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

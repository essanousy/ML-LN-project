When Ning Xi arrived, she was already late.</p><br/><p>Chang Li and Ning Xueluo were smiling from ear to ear as they stepped out of the audition building. They were surrounded by a crowd that offered congratulations.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ning Xi from afar, sweating as she hurried to the building, Ning Xueluo looked at her with the same gaze from five years ago.</p><br/><p>It was the gaze of a deity looking down on an ant.</p><br/><p>A trail of dust was left behind as Ning Xueluo arrogantly left on her minivan. Ning Xi quickly ran into the building after seeing Ning Xueluo depart.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t too late!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ning Xi ran into a group of people who were chatting cheerfully as they were walking. They were the panel judges for the ?Land Under Heaven?auditions.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m late!\u201d Ning Xi bowed deeply.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ning Xi had blocked their path and interrupted them, a couple of the judges exchanged looks, clearly unhappy.</p><br/><p>No one liked people who were late.</p><br/><p>The assistant director kept a straight face, \u201cThe audition is already over. What\u2019s the point in rushing over here? Youngsters are getting more and more unreliable these days!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to try out for the lead role!\u201d Ning Xi started talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You\u2019re not here to try for the female lead? Then what are auditioning for?\u201d The screenwriter asked with interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to try out for the supporting female lead, Meng Changge! As far as I know, you weren\u2019t able to find a suitable actress for the supporting lead during the last auditions!\u201d Ning Xi lifted her head before the screenwriter could respond to her words.</p><br/><p>The instant Ning Xi lifted her head, the surroundings turned quiet for five seconds. The unfriendly assistant director was awestruck.</p><br/><p>What he saw was a girl with full lips, white teeth, waist-long ebony hair, in a crimson dress. Her brilliance could not be suppressed by such a vibrant colour; instead it helped enhance her beauty.</p><br/><p>She was just standing there calmly, yet it was almost as if she was standing in a forest of floating mist. She seemed like a fox spirit with a thousand years of cultivation; that pair of mesmerising eyes would make a person drop their guard and fall into that endless spring of beauty in just an instant. Although her cultivation was that of a spirit fox, she seemed like fairy who had never stepped on the ground. Her eyes held a lustrous depth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d As if they had been lost in a beautiful dream, many of the judges regained their senses only after director Guo Qischeng spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Guo spoke after exchanging glances with the assistant director, screenwriter and film producer \u201cI have some recollection of you, you\u2019re one of Starlight\u2019s artists right? You can go back to prepare, the supporting female lead is yours! You will be notified when filming starts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you director, I will prepare well!\u201d Ning Xi bowed to express her gratitude.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s target had always been the supporting female lead.</p><br/><p>She had been preparing this role for three months by trying to completely understand Meng Changge\u2019s character. Making all the effort to impress the judges with just a single glance.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she had succeeded despite some setbacks.</p><br/><p>Director Guo exclaimed after Ning Xi had left, \u201cWe looked all over for an actress, and the moment we stopped looking, we found the perfect one! Her qualifications are too poor despite being signed to Starlight Entertainment. With her acting record, I didn\u2019t even consider her for the female lead. Though I had never imagined that she would be far more beautiful than in her pictures!\u201d</p><br/><p>Screenwriter Ye Linglong couldn\u2019t suppress his excitement either, \u201cMost importantly, her aura was on point, that gaze from before was too fitting. Meng Changge was a righteous female general before she became the downfall of the nation. She could be pretty and coquettish, yet she would maintain a pure demeanor and state of mind. She could never be vulgar. All the artists that came to audition before acted out brothel courtesans for me, I was fuming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, don\u2019t get worked up, haven\u2019t we finally found the Changge we\u2019ve been waiting for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, in B City, The First People\u2019s Hospital.</p><br/><p>The VIP hospital room that Little Bun was in was currently in a state of chaos.</p><br/><p>The little guy was huddled on the windowsill with bare feet. He was frustrated and screaming at the top of his lungs. No matter how the doctors and nurses tried to persuade him, he wouldn\u2019t come down.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was cajoling him like the most precious person in his heart, but it couldn\u2019t be helped that his efforts were completely ignored by the other.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had just been called back to his company, but with no other options left, Lu Jingli had to call him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I was on my period and had bad stomach cramps. He was sitting next to where I was standing with dyed hair and odd clothes, yet he stood up and offered me the seat.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng looked at the girl as she was reminiscing about the past. He suddenly thought of a saying, \"Love; not knowing where it comes from, deep into it we fall.\"</p><br/><p>Damn it! Was Mo Lingtian blind?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Qin Mufeng was done chatting with Ning Tianxin, Ning Xi dragged him into the kitchen. \"Qin Mufeng, be honest with me. How's Sis Tianxin's condition?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng looked helplessly at her. \"Boss, I've told you a lot of times. Don't fret thing. Tianxin has a frail outer appearance but she's strong inside. She's really calm! She won't fall into depression or seek death!\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you sure?\"</p><br/><p>\"Trust in my professionalism, alright?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's expression indicated she had serious doubts.</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng glanced at the girl in the garden. She looked so thin and pale, but there were no signs of resentment in her expression. Instead, she was relaxed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi waved her hands in front of Qin Mufeng's eyes. \"What are you staring at?\"</p><br/><p>\"With my past experience, I thought her psychological state would be unstable, but in the past few days, she's really surprised me. In a nutshell, Tianxin is really alright. Maybe she was revived after experiencing death once!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was relieved.</p><br/><p>\"So, my job as a psychiatrist is done here! The therapy is finished!\" Qin Mufeng said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was surprised. \"Huh? This soon? It's only been a few days!\"</p><br/><p>\"Nonsense. If I continue to be her psychiatrist, how do I get closer to her?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's eyes flew wide. \"What did you say?\"</p><br/><p>\"Uhm... Nope! Nothing!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi squinted her eyes and looked at him. \"You said it. You want to get closer to her!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng was dripping with sweat. He could only admit, \"Fine, well... Tianxin... She's totally my type! I want to get closer to her!\"</p><br/><p>In his profession, he could not have any other special relationships with his patients.</p><br/><p>\"You bastard! She just went through such a traumatic experience!\" Ning Xi looked like she was about to kill him.</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng waved his hand and shrugged. \"It's exactly because of this that she needs a new relationship to forget about her past painful experience!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at him. \"And... You don't mind Sis Tianxin's condition?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng replied, \"Of course not. It's not her fault that she fell in love with the wrong person. As for having a child, I don't mind at all! I have seven siblings at home. I'm not tasked to have children! My parents are both overseas and they're pretty open about stuff like these!\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you serious?\" Ning Xi frowned.</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng sighed, \"Bro, Tianxin is your cousin. Would I tell you all this without being serious? If I'm just fooling around, don't you think that I'll be afraid you'll break my third leg?\"</p><br/><p>\"Great that you're aware about that!\"</p><br/><p>\"But well, don't tell her that I like her. It'll scare her off if you tell her now while her current condition is stable. She'll have severe trauma!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She looked completely like she was begging for it.</p><br/><p>What kind of tragic situation was this?</p><br/><p>Maybe she was still dreaming and she still hadn\u2019t woken up?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until Ning Xi slowly ran out of breath and was on her last gasp of air that Lu Tingxiao finally let go of her lips. He moved to the part of her neck he had just bitten, and then that burning hot tongue moved back and forth over the wound, as if soothing it, but only made Ning Xi even more horrified\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Lu Tingxiao\u2026 Lu Tingxiao\u2026\u201d Ning Xi called to him a few times, but the other seemed to have no reaction other than getting busy all over her body.</p><br/><p>There was no trace of the usual restrained gentleman, and the warmth she was familiar with. Those sharp teeth moved with his desire and slid from her neck to her collarbones, and moved even lower\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 no!\u201d</p><br/><p>The memories that had been hibernating in her mind sprung up suddenly, flooding her mind. They swept her along and threatened to bury her like a sticky swamp, causing her entire body to tremble uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Just as Ning Xi was starting to wish she were dead, all movement on her body stopped, leaving just that heavy and hard body pressing down on hers without movement, like a mountain.</p><br/><p>That feeling of suffocation slowly faded away, leaving only blank confusion in her heart\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLu\u2026 Lu Tingxiao?\u201d Ning Xi tried to pat the man\u2019s shoulder, but there was no reaction at all.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a few more seconds and seeing that the other wasn\u2019t moving at all, Ning Xi carefully tried to flip him over to the side with gentle movements.</p><br/><p>Borrowing the moonlight streaming through the window, she saw that the man was calmly lying there with his eyes closed, like a sleeping king, as if that terrifying beast of a man just now hadn\u2019t been him.</p><br/><p>What in the world was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 don\u2019t tell me he was sleepwalking?!\u201d Ning Xi mumbled to herself.</p><br/><p>It seemed like only that explanation fit.</p><br/><p>However, wasn\u2019t the way he sleepwalked completely novel? He came to her room in the middle of the night and started biting on her like a vampire. He even managed to hold a conversation with her just now, as if he wasn\u2019t sleepwalking?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s breathing was even and deep, it looked as if he had fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t dare to wake him, worried that he would go crazy again. However, she didn\u2019t feel safe leaving him here like this either. Who could she call for help this late at night?</p><br/><p>After thinking back and forth, she finally thought of someone.</p><br/><p>Picking up her phone, she called Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Xiao Xixi! Wow! You\u2019re actually calling me this late at night! What happened, what happened?\u201d Lu Jingli was very loud, as if he was shouting into the phone.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had at first been worried that she would be disturbing him by calling this late at night. However, on the other side of the line, Lu Jingli\u2019s voice was so energetic and there was a lot of noise coming from the background. From the sound of it, he was holding a party.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Jingli, I need to ask you something!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk away, ask away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? What\u2019s up with my brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was this guy a repeater? Why did he have to say everything twice!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless for a moment before anxiously asking: \u201cDoes your brother sleepwalk?\u201d</p><br/><p>While on the phone, Ning Xi didn\u2019t notice that the man who was lying down straight by her side stiffened imperceptibly after she asked that question.</p><br/><p>He had just thought of this idea on the spot to get out of the awkward situation. He hadn\u2019t thought that Ning Xi would actually call Lu Jingli. What if that stupid fellow gave his ploy away\u2026</p><br/><p>Then he would only have to break his legs!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

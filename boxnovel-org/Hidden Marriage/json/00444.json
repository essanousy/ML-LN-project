Even though I\u2019ve never been in contact with it before, old designs like this are easy to guess. I\u2019m pretty sure that this is the P229 that was acquired by the Germans in 1991. It should be the SIG Sauer P229 pistol,\" she finished, throwing the gun aside again.</p><br/><p>Shi Xiao\u2019s men did not have any hope left and they were praying that Ning Xi knew something about the gun from her previous acting experiences, just like the luck she had last round.</p><br/><p>But naturally, they were prepared for a fight. If things went south, they would all charge up to the foreigners, taking down as many as they could since they would not have been spared anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"So? Is my answer correct or not?\" Ning Xi looked at the silent bald man, expressionless.</p><br/><p>The bald man only replied sometime later with a cold tone, \"I heard he said that you\u2019re an actress.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re right,\" Ning Xi did not deny it. She was an actress now, working hard on her own, charging towards her own goal with her talents and effort.</p><br/><p>\"No wonder, as an actress you\u2019d have been involved in gunfight scenes. So that\u2019s how you know about these guns, it's nothing too impressive,\" the bald man scoffed and took her knowledge for granted.</p><br/><p>\"Actress?! What a useless piece of trash that only knows how to sell her body and get involved in dirty deals! Killing a disgusting pig like you would be best done with just my hands,\" sneered Alice, glaring at Ning Xi fiercely as she instinctively hated actresses.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, my dear Alice, I\u2019m bored of this game already. Why not we change the rules? What\u2019s more interesting than recognizing guns?\" the bald man asked Alice suggestively.</p><br/><p>\"Didn\u2019t you like seeing them fight among themselves? Just let them kill one another off, and we can just enjoy their performances,\" replied Alice.</p><br/><p>\"Right, that reminds me,\" the bald man said and stood up with a smile as he looked at Shi Xiao's man, \"Stupid pig, didn\u2019t you want to kill that woman just now? Here\u2019s your chance, go on and choke her to death and I\u2019ll consider sparing your life. What do you think? You don\u2019t get rare chances like this very often in your life.\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xiao's man, whose white shirt was soaked in sweat, had a shift in his expression, \"You...are you serious?! If you are\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, the bald man laughed, \"Of course, my buddy, I\u2019m someone who honors the rules. As long as you follow my rules, then you\u2019ll have a chance to live.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, it's a deal!\" Shi Xiao's man said would be no different from stepping on an ant.</p><br/><p>\"I dare you!\" Xiong Zhi roared at him like an enraged beast.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had strictly ordered him to protect the actress.</p><br/><p>\"Stupid pig, don\u2019t do anything reckless and just watch. If not, I\u2019ll shoot your brains out,\" another foreign man said to Xiong Zhi while pointing a gun at him.</p><br/><p>Xiong Zhi knew that if he did anything more, a bullet would be sent right through his skull.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He dies, but I\u2019ll let you go; or two, put the wedding dress on and be my bride in exchange for Raoul\u2019s life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Raoul loved Christine dearly, so when he heard the Phantom, he said without hesitation, \u201cChristine, don\u2019t promise him. Don\u2019t marry this devil!

She used up all of her professionalism to not forget herself then and there.</p><br/><p>The instant Ning Xi was kissed, everyone present was about to go crazy. The atmosphere had reached an unprecedented peak while the viewer ratings and the popularity of the live stream channels broke all of its previous records in history.</p><br/><p>With just a short performance, Ning Xi\u2019s votes on-screen had caught up with Han Zixuan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly kissed by the girl he loved by her own initiative, the Phantom\u2019s wild and unruly expression suddenly turned blank.</p><br/><p>His initially sinister and scary expression was unexpectedly extremely adorable at this point.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

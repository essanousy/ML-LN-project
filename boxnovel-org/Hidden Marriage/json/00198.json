You actually signed with Golden Age!\u201d Why didn\u2019t you talk to me about it?! Don\u2019t tell me you still haven\u2019t checked your email?!\u201d Jiang Muye roared</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Weren\u2019t you supposed to be busy? I didn\u2019t want to bother you. Besides, what does my signing have to do with the email you sent me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Jiang Muye\u2019s voice was too loud, Nin Xi gave Lu Ting Xiao an embarrassed smile, then held her cell phone closely and headed to her room.</p><br/><p>Behind, Lu Jingli touched his chin thoughtfully and glanced at his brother with meaningful eyes, \u201cBrother, it seems someone is trying give you a road block. It sucks that you guys like the same woman! Fortunately, I don\u2019t think Ning Xi likes this type of tch\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Muye! Your rival is too terrible!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>On the other end of Ning Xi\u2019s phone, Muye was flaming mad, \u201cYou still haven\u2019t checked your email till now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I forgot about it! What is so important about that thing? I thought it was just some spam video\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye took a deep breath, stressing each syllable, \u201cYou, open it immediately, this second, right now, open your email to see what I sent you. Don\u2019t hang up on me, just open it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMake sure you stay on the line. You need to see this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi reluctantly opened her computer, and logged into her email, rushing to find Jiang Muye\u2019s email and download the attachments.</p><br/><p>It was a picture and an audio.</p><br/><p>She first opened the picture, it was a screenshot from a WeChat record.</p><br/><p>[Oh my, my grandson is so cute . Oh my, my son is so handsome! Ting Xiao, who selected your and Little Treasure\u2019s clothes? Is it that girl you like?]</p><br/><p>[Yes]</p><br/><p>[I knew it! You can\u2019t possibly choose this style of clothing. Look at how bright the colors are, it\u2019s so nice! It\u2019s not like the boring clothes you wear all day. And you also made Little Treasure wear those clothes too! This is why your home really needs a woman!]</p><br/><p>[Did she take the photos?]</p><br/><p>[Yes]</p><br/><p>[My future sister-in-law is great! She actually has the ability to get you to wear clothes of this color and have you pose obediently for pictures. I remember I gave you a suit that was almost identical to this color and your expression was so disdainful. You even criticized my aesthetic/style!]</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This was a conversation with Lu Ting Xiao, the two elder Lu\u2019s, and Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you look at it?\u201d Jiang Muye urged</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u201d Ning Xi replied, a complicated expression and her face. She then proceeded to open the audio.</p><br/><p>After the sounds of rustling, then came the voice of Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, what do you plan on doing to Ning Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then came the sound of Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cTowards Ning Xi\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Don\u2019t you think your attitude towards Ning Xi is too ambiguous?\u201d Jiang Muye asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao replied in a lazy and dangerous tone: \u201cI think my actions have been quite obvious, if you still don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ning Xi\u2019s heart suddenly jumped to her throat, as if she was at the scene waiting with Jiang Muye to hear the rest of Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>What will he say? Waiting for the three seconds, was like waiting for three centuries, and finally sound came from Lu Ting Xiao.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was ignorant to the situation. Understand? Understand what?</p><br/><p>Just as Ning Xi thought she missed something and was clicking the replay button, she heard Muye\u2019s voice over the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not deaf, he really only said those three words. However, before he said those words, he kissed you in front of my face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chapter 198 \u2013 He Kissed You In Front Of Me Teaser</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Jiang\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xiao Xi!

Your rival is too terrible!</p><br/><p>The Bat translation team watches Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s silent but deadly hit towards his own brother, glad they escaped the last time without getting caught.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao turns to the translation team, \u201cI need you to go get me Jiang Muye\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out of the country sir\u201d We reply as respectfully as possible. Blazaria hiding behind her three editors.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao raises one eyebrow as if to say did I stutter. We quickly depart so we won\u2019t be next</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He knew nearly as much as Gong Shangze. If he were to prove it this way, he might be being too naive.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze looked at the models wearing \u201cRainbow Feathers\u201d, then he looked back at David. \u201cBefore I prove myself, I\u2019d like to ask Director David a question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese six sets of clothing used a lot of traditional Chinese techniques. The embroidery is especially excellent. I heard all the embroidery was done by you personally. Is it true?\u201d Gong Shangze asked coldly.</p><br/><p>David raised his eyebrows.</p><br/><p><em>Haha, this guy was laying a trap right here!</em></p><br/><p>David then said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s extremely difficult, which is why I did it personally. If you don\u2019t believe me, I can prove it to you right now.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Gong Shangze, do you think I can really stay in this industry without knowing some tricks?</em></p><br/><p>Some people within the industry started discussing when they heard Gong Shangze\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Gong Shangze think David didn\u2019t create these clothing himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGong Shangze is going to fail. David is really good at embroidery, especially Su embroidery. Su embroidery technique was applied to these garments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, even if he proved David wasn\u2019t the one who made these clothing, he can\u2019t prove that he didn\u2019t design them, can he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze ignored the whisperings around him. He replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to the discussion, David smiled gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s normal to have some doubts here.\u201d</p><br/><p>David then looked at the clothing and said in reminiscence, \u201cThe Chinese fashion culture is deep and wide. The techniques are a cut above the rest. It\u2019s always been my dream to bring our culture onto an international stage, which is why, aside from design, I\u2019ve involved myself in researching on handcrafts. Creating an item based on a design from paper is a very meaningful process to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile good designers do not necessarily have to be a good tailor, a designer with knowledge of the craft would help to deepen the understanding of fashion design.\u201d</p><br/><p>David\u2019s words were well-received by his colleagues.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze had remained silent from the beginning until now.</p><br/><p>When David finished his words, the young man moved and walked slowly towards the center of the T-shaped stage.</p><br/><p>The sharp gazes of strangers were focusing on his back. The socially-anxious young man took each step as if he was going through a path of icy blades. However, he knew that he could not stop or turn around.</p><br/><p>Someone was looking at him.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at him oddly when he went up on stage.</p><br/><p>People were starting to get impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is he doing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA good international show has now been ruined by this clown!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone should\u2019ve chased him out just now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>More and more voices of dissatisfaction came from the crowd. Gong Shangze went beside a model who was wearing the \u201cRainbow Feathers\u201d.</p><br/><p>His white fingers slowly folded the extra large sleeve up and he turned the sleeve inside out.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the young man looked at David with his sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, here\u2019s my second question. I\u2019d like to know why did you embroider my name on your own work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d David\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>High-definition cameras closed in.</p><br/><p>On the large screen at the back was the inside of the sleeve. There were clearly three Chinese characters embroidered: Gong Shangze!</p></div>\n</div>"}

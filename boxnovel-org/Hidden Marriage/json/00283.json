In fact, it was the total opposite of what she had predicted would happen based on previous circumstances. Instead of ruining Ning Xi\u2019s reputation, she gained lots of new fans and popularity.</p><br/><p>Damn you, witch, you actually managed to handle Jiang Muye. No wonder the signing of the contract with Glory World sailed smoothly.</p><br/><p>Even though she had said \"small time actor\", she knew in her heart that Jiang Muye was not just any celebrity.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s mom, Tan Jingxian was Lu family\u2019s goddaughter. Jiang Muye actually referred to the Lu parents as grandmother and grandfather, while calling Lu Tingxiao his uncle!</p><br/><p>With such connections, even if they were not related by blood, it was already considered a close kinship.</p><br/><p>With the Lu family\u2019s support, the Jiang family\u2019s business had expanded massively. As the Jiang family only had Jiang Muye an only son, the family business would definitely be inherited by him.</p><br/><p>However, with Jiang Muye\u2019s personality, he was probably only messing around with Ning Xi for a while. Ning Xueluo doubted she would reach to the point of marriage. What a proposterous thought!</p><br/><p>\"If you look down upon actors, then what are you?\" Ning Xi asked with eyebrows raised.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m still mom and dad\u2019s daughter, and Ning family\u2019s eldest daughter. Naturally, I\u2019m nobler than you are!\" Ning Xueluo said this arrogantly, obviously purposefully boasting about how Ning Yaohua and Zhuang Lingyu did not hold a grudge against her for that incident.</p><br/><p>She chose this industry not only because she loved being sought after and enjoyed the feeling of getting what Ning Xi could not, but the best part was that she could widen her network.</p><br/><p>This time too, it was thanks to the fact that she pulled some strings to help Ning International close a big deal that she could walk away from the shadow of framing Ning Xi. She really had to be more careful from then on.</p><br/><p>As she thought about this, Ning Xueluo suddenly felt empowered and haughtily said, \"You sold yourself for merely eight million, someone like you don\u2019t deserve to be comparing and negotiating with me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Pfft\u2026\" Ning Xi burst out laughing as she heard this.</p><br/><p>\"What are you laughing at?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at her unbothered and said, \"I\u2019m laughing at the eight million!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo frowned, \"Ning Xi, you can stop being weird with me. What do you mean?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shook her head and sighed, \"\"Miss Ning, I\u2019m really sorry but I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d be this stupid. I can\u2019t believe you still don\u2019t know where I got the eight million from.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo scoffed coldly, \"Isn\u2019t it from you prostituting yourself to Jiang Muye? What is there that I don\u2019t know about?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had a smug expression as she leaned forward to her ear and said in a low voice, \"That eight million dollars worth of breach of contract fee...didn\u2019t you give that to me yourself?\"</p><br/><p>\"What? I gave that to you?! Ning Xi, you\u2019re crazy, aren\u2019t you? Why would I have\u2026\" Ning Xueluo stopped mid-sentence before she widened her eyes and said, \"Ning Xi...it was you..the person who threatened and intimidated me was you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, it was me. What are you going to do about it?\"</p><br/><p>\"You were blackmailing me! I\u2019m going to sue you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ahhh, I\u2019m so afraid!\"</p><br/><p>\"You...you\u2026\" Ning Xueluo was furious.</p><br/><p>She never would have thought her hard earned money would have ended up in Ning Xi\u2019s pocket as her breach of contract fee.</p><br/><p>The incident had finally subsided and she could never mention it again. Besides, she didn\u2019t have any evidence. She had long hired people to decode those anonymous letters and the bank account but to no avail.</p><br/><p>At last, she had no choice but to swallow her defeat.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

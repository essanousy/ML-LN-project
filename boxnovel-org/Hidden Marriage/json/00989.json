My poor children will be abandoned by you!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao turned to her, his eyes shining brighter than the stars in the sky. \"I won't abandon them. Let's make some.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi coughed, \"Keep calm. I was just saying.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi chatted about all sorts of things from having babies to the number of boys and girls they wanted...until there was a weird noise coming from the tent beside them. It sounded like a girl crying.</p><br/><p>\"Is someone crying?\" Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\"Nope,\" Lu Tingxiao replied expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\"No? But I heard it.\"</p><br/><p>The voices became clearer.</p><br/><p>\"Mmm...mmm...ah...no...don't...be gentler\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi kept quiet.</p><br/><p>As the noises got more and more intense, Ning Xi understood what were they doing. It was the pair of newlyweds beside their tent.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi won the battle in the daytime, so they wanted a rematch at night!</p><br/><p>\"Mmm...dear, why do you think there's nothing happening in Lu Tingxiao's tent? Could he be tired from hiking? He has such good stamina though.\"</p><br/><p>\"You naughty little thing! Are you really talking about another's man stamina in front of me?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah...slower...how annoying...mmm\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Their voices got louder and wilder; almost everyone could hear them. It was understandable as they were newlyweds, so some of them just turned a deaf ear. However, of course, there were some that could not stand it.</p><br/><p>\"You bastard, Zhao Haisheng! Keep your voice down!\" Mo Lingtian roared from his tent.</p><br/><p>Everyone else laughed. They all thought that the showdown ended.</p><br/><p>They had anticipated hearing something from Lu Tingxiao and his little bunny's tent, but Zhao Haisheng and his wife got to it first.</p><br/><p>But there was really nothing happening in Lu Tingxiao's tent. Was he really that tired from carrying Ning Xi today?</p><br/><p>Just as everyone was thinking about it, suddenly there was a loud crash. Bam!</p><br/><p>Everyone hurried out of their tents to see Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi's tent collapsed...</p><br/><p>Even the tent collapsed! Just how intense were they?</p><br/><p>As expected of Lu Tingxiao\u2026</p><br/><p>A short while later, Lu Tingxiao helped Ning Xi out of the tent with a dark expression. He stared at the girl. \"So, this is your very solid tent?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

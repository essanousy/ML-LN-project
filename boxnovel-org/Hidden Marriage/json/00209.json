Wasn\u2019t today\u2019s press conference very smooth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Every little detail had been taken care of\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it your fault!\u201d Ning Xi replied irritably, then sat up staring him in the eyes: \u201cI want to ask you\u2026on that day did Lu Ting Xiao\u2026..really\u2026\u2026kiss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye took a drink from his cup of wine: \u201cIf I lie to you, I will burn all my game systems. After this night, I will no longer play video games!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded: \u201cOkay, I believe you.\u201d This was a serious oath.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye couldn\u2019t help but curse: \u201cYou have my number! How many times did I remind you to open your mail! You didn\u2019t listen! He is simply playing you! How long have you known Lu Ting Xiao and how long have you known me? Yet you didn\u2019t believe me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye has the appearance of being injured,</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed, \u201cIn fact, from the first time I met with Lu Ting Xiao, he told me something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Jiang Muye asked, his expression tight</p><br/><p>Ning Xi replied \u201cHe asked to marry me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuff\u2026\u2026\u2026.cough cough cough\u2026\u2026.what did you say?\u201d Jiang Muye almost choked to death on his wine.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi vigorously patted his back, \u201cI was even more shocked than you were!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Jiang Muye hastily asked</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I naturally asked him why he wanted to marry me! It was simply too unscientific!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that since I saved Little Treasure, he would pay me with his body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying! What was your answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said that even though I saved Little Treasure, he also saved me so it\u2019s an even draw. There was no need to report or repay, then I ran away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye stood up, pacing back and forth a dozen times: \u201cI really want to strangle you. You knew of Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s intentions since the beginning and you still haven\u2019t hidden away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi only raised an eyebrow: \u201cCome on, with Little Treasure depending on me as a favor? Besides, I always thought that it was because of Little Treasure that Lu Ting Xiao wanted to marry me. When I refused, he didn\u2019t continue to press the matter so what is the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares about Little Treasure! That\u2019s simply hypocrisy! And you, you\u2019re a pig!\u201d Jiang Muye finally stopped pacing and stared at her. \u201cLet\u2019s just say under special circumstances a hero were to save the girl. If the girl is boring, she would certainly thank the hero for rescuing her and is willing to do favors to repay him but he wouldn\u2019t be interested. If the girl is interesting, what would she say? Seriously Ning Xi what is the answer?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi touched her chin thoughtfully: \u201cWell\u2026..maybe she will say that she\u2019s willing to pay him back with her body?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo now you know what \u2018favors\u2019 mean now no?! To you you\u2019re doing labor, but he finds you fancy and interesting!\u201d Jiang Muye shouted in her ear</p><br/><p>Ning Xi, her ears numbed by the shout replied quietly: \u201dWhen you put it that way, it kind of makes sense\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201cIt\u2019s the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly stood up and grabbed Jiang Muye\u2019s shoulder, forcing him to sit calmly on the sofa. \u201cSince you asked me, I also have a question for you\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye, looked at her vigilantly and said \u201cWhat do you want to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you walked into a room, and you see the girl you like on an aphrodisiac, wearing transparent lingerie, lying on a king size bed covered in red rose petals what would you do?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

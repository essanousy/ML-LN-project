If there\u2019s a need, I\u2019ll surely look for you!\"</p><br/><p>Before Little Treasure\u2019s condition stabilized, she would not let anyone be in contact with Little Treasure easily, even if it was Guan Ziyao.</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao still felt hopeful and she asked, \"Is Little Treasure going to school now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, he is.\"</p><br/><p>\"Which school?\" Guan Ziyao asked again.</p><br/><p>\"Glorious Kindergarten.\"</p><br/><p>\"As far as I know, it\u2019s a good school, but it is just a normal kindergarten...with Little Treasure\u2019s condition, he should go to a special needs school! I know a school specially designed for kids with autism. I\u2019ve personally gone there before for a project. It\u2019s really well planned and most of the children have had positive changes after they went there. I know the principal. Do you want to have Little Treasure transferred there?\" Guan Ziyao probed.</p><br/><p>Although Yan Ruyi did not think Little Treasure was autistic, if there was anything that could help him progress, she would be willing to try.</p><br/><p>She was slightly tempted by Guan Ziyao\u2019s persuasive tone, but she hesitated again, \"Well, I need to talk to Tingxiao about it before making a decision.\"</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao quickly clarified, \"Of course, it\u2019s not an urgent matter, just contact me anytime you need me! I\u2019ll talk to Tingxiao about this later and see what he thinks!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright...thank you, Ziyao!\" Yan Ruyi was relieved.</p><br/><p>Not only did Guan Ziyao not mind about Little Treasure\u2019s existence, she was so concerned about him, pleasing Yan Ruyi immensely.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As they were chatting casually, a maid suddenly rushed towards them. Whispering into Yan Ruyi\u2019s ears, she said, \"Madam, Little Master...Little Master has gone missing!\"</p><br/><p>\"What? What did you say?\" Yan Ruyi\u2019s expression changed drastically.</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao looked over. \"What happened?\"</p><br/><p>A while later, Yan Ruyi, Guan Ziyao, Lu Chongshan, Lu Tingxiao, and Lu Jingli all appeared in the room Little Treasure was in.</p><br/><p>Lu Chongshan looked displeased. \"Why would he suddenly go missing? What were you doing?\"</p><br/><p>The maid looked at Yan Ruyi, then at Guan Ziyao, her expression troubled. In order to avoid Lu Chongshan\u2019s anger, she replied honestly, \"Actually, Little Master came out a little while ago, but when he overheard Madam Lu\u2019s conversation with Ms. Guan, he suddenly ran away. There were too many people at that moment and I was unable to catch up, then I couldn\u2019t find him anywhere\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The maid was sobbing. The Little Master was the core of the family! If anything happened to him, she would be done for!</p><br/><p>\"What were you both talking about?\" Lu Chongshan stared sharply at Yan Ruyi and Guan Ziyao.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruyi\u2019s face went pale. \"Could it be\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao\u2019s expression changed as well.</p><br/><p>\"Say something!\" Lu Chongshan looked at Yan Ruyi anxiously.</p><br/><p>As Lu Chongshan was asking Yan Ruyi, Guan Ziyao\u2019s voice sounded out from Lu Tingxiao\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>\"Aunty, Little Treasure\u2019s condition...I knew a little...special needs child...when Zhichen was five years old...I knew a school designed for children with autism\u2026\"</p><br/><p>As they were talking, Lu Tingxiao had calmly accessed the CCTV system and checked through the footages\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

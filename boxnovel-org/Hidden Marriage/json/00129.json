She stood in front of Su Yan, and a tear fell from the corner of her eye, \u201cYan-gege, do you blame me? Do you blame me for not agreeing to Ning Xi\u2019s request\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling his heart ache, Su Yan reached out to wipe the tear on her cheek, \u201cWhy would I blame you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo threw herself into his arms as if she had just been granted redemption, \u201cYan-gege, thank you. Thank you for believing in me, for understanding me. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t give up the riches and position of the Ning family. I just can\u2019t leave behind my father and mother. Once I think of leaving them behind, of never seeing them again, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t cry anymore. I know, I know all of this\u2026\u201d Su Yan patted her back gently and sighed, \u201cI was too naive, thinking that she was the same Xiao Xi as before. Xueluo, I promise you. From now on, I won\u2019t let her bully you, and I won\u2019t let her hurt you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan-gege\u2026\u201d Ning Xueluo stared at the man before her with infatuated eyes. Her smooth arms wrapped around his neck as she delivered her lips to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still on set, what if someone sees\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if they see? You\u2019re my boyfriend!\u201d Ning Xueluo protested coquettishly and sat in his lap. Her fingers stroked his chest before she undid the buttons on his shirt one by one.</p><br/><p>Heh, Ning Xi. I\u2019m going to sleep with your man, how about it\u2026</p><br/><p>After a short moment, pants and gasps sounded from within the dressing room.</p><br/><p>\u201cNn\u2026 Ah! Yan-gege, you\u2019re awesome! Harder! A little harder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan-gege, who do you think is better? Me or Ning Xi? Hm? Who\u2019s better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>If they were talking about looks, Ning Xi actually won over Ning Xueluo in that department. However, she had been rather introverted and timid in the past. She had no knowledge of the birds and the bees, let alone taking the initiative to do something to make him happy.</p><br/><p>At first, he had liked how pure she was compared to other girls. However, as time passed, it quickly got old.</p><br/><p>However, the current Ning Xi was like a completely different person. It was as if\u2026</p><br/><p>As if she was an alluring fox spirit\u2026</p><br/><p>Her personality had clearly taken a turn for the worse and she couldn\u2019t even be reasoned with now. However, it was hard to turn his gaze away from her\u2026</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s breathing quickened. At the last moment, the image that surfaced in his mind was the faint, careless smile on her face\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXueluo-jie, filming is about to start. Can I call the makeup artist over to put on your makeup?\u201d The little assistant was blushing as she stood outside the door awkwardly.</p><br/><p>She had been by Ning Xueluo\u2019s side for so long that she was already accustomed to things like this happening.</p><br/><p>What pure and innocent virgin\u2026 Ning Xueluo was clearly a temptress. The fans should really hear how wanton their goddess sounded like in bed\u2026</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi had finished her preparations, she had to wait half an hour before Ning Xueluo finally walked over slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for making everyone wait. My skin isn\u2019t very good today, so I spent more time on makeup.\u201d Ning Xueluo explained apologetically, her voice hoarse and languid. The gaze she cast at Ning Xi was filled with pride and provocation. When she walked past Ning Xi, she even purposely adjusted her collar, showing off the red hickies on her neck.</p><br/><p>With her flushed face, misty eyes and the particular, sweet smell on her body, it was as if she was afraid that everyone wouldn\u2019t be able to tell what she had just done.</p><br/><p>A vein throbbed on Ning Xi\u2019s forehead. If not for the sake of filming, she would have refused to breathe the same air as Ning Xueluo out of disgust.</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng clapped his hands, \u201cAlright, since everyone\u2019s here, let\u2019s start. Take your places, everyone! Action!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

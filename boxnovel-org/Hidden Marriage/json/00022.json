Just ask Ning Xi to come over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Lu Tingxiao rejected the idea coldly.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli earnestly tried to sway him, \u201cBrother, Little Treasure is just a child, not one of your subordinates. You\u2019re being too harsh on him, what\u2019s the problem with spoiling him a little? All children have times where they\u2019re stubborn or cause trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your place to interfere with how I educate my child.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face was frosty. It seemed that he was determined not to let Little Treasure get used to the bad habit of throwing a tantrum to get what he wanted.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was feeling awkward being trapped between this pair of father and son. This was such a headache!</p><br/><p>If things worsened to the point that their parents would hear about it, the matter of him taking Little Treasure to a bar would be completely exposed once they started investigating.</p><br/><p>Gods, please send someone to save him!</p><br/><p>When Lu Tingxiao went to capture Little Treasure, Lu Jingli hurriedly found his phone and secretly called Ning Xi\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At night, Ning Xi was at home reading a script while half-heartedly chatting with someone online.</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: Little Ning Xi, can\u2019t you change your outdated QQ name? It hurts the eyes!</p><br/><p>My Lonely Empty Loss: So Corrupted Devil King doesn\u2019t hurt the eyes? You don\u2019t feel embarrassed scolding me?</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: Cough, I\u2019m coming back to China next month, come pick me up at the airport!</p><br/><p>My Lonely Empty Loss: Not going, not free.</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: Pick me up!</p><br/><p>My Lonely Empty Loss: I already said I\u2019m not free!</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: Are you coming or not?</p><br/><p>My Lonely Empty Loss: The person you\u2019re contacting doesn\u2019t want to talk and throws a dog over</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: The person you\u2019re contacting screws your dog</p><br/><p>My Lonely Empty Loss: The dog feels that it\u2019s been violated by a needle</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: ****! How are you even more nasty than I am! Also, who are you saying has a needle!</p><br/><p>My Lonely Empty Loss: You\u2019re the one who started acting dirty, I\u2019m not wasting any more time with you. I still have to read my script.</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: It\u2019s just a small supporting female lead role, what\u2019s there to look at! We used to have feelings for each other, are you really going to be so heartless?</p><br/><p>My Lonely Empty Loss: There are tons of people who used to be together with me, what number are you?</p><br/><p>Corrupted Devil King: Little Ning Xi! You just wait for laozi!!!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi closed her laptop and wholeheartedly started studying her script.</p><br/><p>After reading for a while, her cell phone suddenly sounded. It was a unfamiliar number.</p><br/><p>She was worried that it was the drama crew calling, so she picked up the call immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Ning Xi, save me!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lu Jingli, come quickly to the Platinum Palace, something\u2019s happened to Little Treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What happened to Little Treasure?\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s heart immediately tightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely urgent, come over quickly, hurry\u2026 B-b-brother, calm down\u2026 He\u2019s still young\u2026 Little Treasure, Little Treasure, you can\u2019t smash that\u2026 Ah\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli made it sound so serious, and with the sounds of things falling and smashing coming from the phone, Ning Xi became even more tense. She hurriedly changed as she said, \u201cI\u2019m coming over immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even she didn\u2019t know what had happened to her. As soon as she heard something had happened to Little Treasure, she couldn\u2019t sit still anymore.</p><br/><p>She had only known him for several days, yet he was already in her heart and she couldn\u2019t let him go.</p><br/><p>This place was pretty far from Platinum Palace and taking a taxi would take at least forty minutes. Ning Xi was worried that something would happen if she took too long so she pushed her motorcycle out and blazed off towards Platinum Palace.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi only took ten minutes to make the forty minute trip.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had most likely notified the security guards, as they let her in as soon as she gave her name. There was already a maid waiting to bring her in when she arrived outside Villa No. 8.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

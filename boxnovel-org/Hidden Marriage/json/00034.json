Chairman Ning, your daughter is so talented that she doesn\u2019t need my care at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis child is always so busy! Even as her father, I have to personally make a trip or else I wouldn\u2019t get to see her!\u201d Ning Yaohua said angrily. Although he said it with a straight face, there wasn\u2019t a trace of actual anger in his eyes, only fondness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, you should be happy that Xueluo works so hard. However, Xueluo, you\u2019re also in the wrong. No matter how hard you\u2019re working, you should always return home!\u201d Director Guo got angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, Director. I shouldn\u2019t have done that! Dad, don\u2019t get angry, I\u2019ll be home for dinner tomorrow night!\u201d Ning Xueluo hugged Ning Yaohua\u2019s arm and acted coquettishly, having the appearance of an obedient daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this, I need the director to help me talk to my daughter before she agrees to come home for dinner!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, there are so many people here, leave me some dignity!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes yes, you\u2019re a big star now, I can\u2019t even admonish you anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought that she had already refined her heart into steel. She didn\u2019t think that she would see such a show of fatherly affection and daughterly devotion here. Her chest tightened to the point of suffocating, and she was close to bolting out the door.</p><br/><p>Although she couldn\u2019t control her inner heart, she could cover it up by acting perfectly on the surface. She discussed the script with the screenwriter calmly, as if she didn\u2019t notice what was going on opposite her.</p><br/><p>She could ignore it, but some people were unable to do so. Ning Yaohua\u2019s gaze was like a knife cutting her body, as if seeing her at a public event was something shameful and disgusting.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally borrowed the excuse of needing the washroom to leave the room and get some fresh air next to an open window in the corridor.</p><br/><p>She dug in her bag and brought out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. She held onto the thin cigarette for quite a while before finally putting it back.</p><br/><p>She was in the middle of quitting.</p><br/><p>Today was the first time she had actually lost to the urge.</p><br/><p>The night breeze blowing strongly on her face helped her feel a little better.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the sound of footsteps sounded from behind her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s back stiffened, but she turned anyway. The expression on her face was like a mask that revealed no emotions, \u201cAre you looking for me, Chairman Ning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua stared at her with a heavy gaze, looking at her eye-catching outfit unhappily.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi lowered her eyes and smiled shallowly, \u201cHeh, Chairman Ning, you were also staring at me in this manner in the room just now. Aren\u2019t you afraid that others will mistake your intentions towards me?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the eyes of others, he was a sponsor, while her identity was that of a pretty female starlet. It was the easiest kind of relationship to start rumours about.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, what kind of words are you saying?\u201d Ning Yaohua was abruptly in a rage.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her brows, \u201cOf course I\u2019m speaking in a human language, is Chairman Dong not human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ning Yaohua suddenly raised his hand.</p><br/><p>Before it landed, it was grabbed by a slender wrist.</p><br/><p>How could she allow Ning Yaohua to hit her again?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have the right to do so.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua was enraged. He violently pulled his hand back, \u201cI want you to withdraw from this role right now. Don\u2019t shame me in front of others!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s expression was cold, \u201cI got this role fair and square, so how would it shame you in any way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just following whatever Xueluo wants to do. Take a look at yourself, you can\u2019t measure up to Xueluo. You were so eager to enter the entertainment industry. Are you just waiting for someone to dig out your dirty past and shame the Ning family?\u201d Ning Yaohua watched her with an expression of extreme disgust.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

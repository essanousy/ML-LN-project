She shook her head and said, \"Let them be, he\u2019s just sending her off.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Chongshan\u2019s expression was still unhappy, but he gave in anyway.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Little Treasure walked along a short green pebbled path. It would take them 10 minutes to reach the courtyard gate.</p><br/><p>Along the path, Ning Xi kept thinking about words to comfort the little bun, but she was unable to come up with anything.</p><br/><p>The little bun looked down, refusing to lift his head up.</p><br/><p>After a while, he took out his writing board, and started writing.</p><br/><p>The little bun showed Ning Xi the board after he was done with it, on the board it was written\u2014</p><br/><p>[Tagore once said: If you love her, let your love surround her like sunlight, and set her free.]</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's sadness vanished after she saw what Little Treasure wrote, \"Baby, you even know about Tagore! Where did you learn this from?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi squatted down and hugged the little bun tightly and with a heart full of warmth, she told him, \"Thank you...I\u2019m really thankful for you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She really did not expect Little Treasure to show her something as heart-touching as this. As she was hugging Little Treasure, she saw a familiar shadow closing in.</p><br/><p>She quickly kissed the little bun and told him that she would find a chance to visit him again, then she ran away...</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao felt forlorn when he saw the girl running away swiftly.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli laughed out loud, \"Bro, Xiao Xi runs faster than a mutant rabbit when she sees you!\"</p><br/><p>He then looked at the little bun and said, \"It\u2019s really unfair! I understand now that no matter what I say it can never be on par with a kiss from Little Treasure. If there\u2019s something a kiss cannot solve, then two kisses!</p><br/><p>\"So, bro, why don't you let Little Treasure do his thing and change our parents' mind. Won't it solve the huge issue between you and Xiao Xi?\"</p><br/><p>\"This isn\u2019t the biggest problem between us\", Lu Tingxiao replied coldly.</p><br/><p>He knew clearly that the suggestion to have Ning Xi resign and become Little Treasure\u2019s tutor was the best compromise the old man could make.</p><br/><p>However, his ultimate goal was accomplished, when he saw how much influence Ning Xi had over Little Treasure. He knew that Father Lu would not try to do anything to her.</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi left, Lu Chongshan called both sons into his study room.</p><br/><p>\"Seeing that it\u2019s all for Little Treasure, I will not pursue what happened last night further, but there will be no next time!\"</p><br/><p>\"Father, why are you so troublesome! Just let brother marry her already, then everything will be solved. How awesome would that be?\"</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Lu Chongshan did not get angry at Lu Jingli, instead he sighed, \"Jingli, if it had been you, I would have agreed to the marriage.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli shivered, \"Father, can you stop making such terrifying statements?\"</p><br/><p>This was just causing him more trouble!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Holy shit! If I\u2019m not wrong, that\u2019s actually a Beretta 92F! Where did she get that?\u201d Lu Jingli looked incredulous.</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, a tragic thought flashed through his mind: his second chance today at being a hero and saving the damsel in distress had just died a premature death!</p><br/><p>Inside the room, Zhang Jiang stared rigidly at the gun in Ning Xi\u2019s hand. He was deathly afraid that she would open fire without saying a word again. She hadn\u2019t even given him a chance to react. She was too cruel!</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I-I\u2026 Everything I said was the truth! There wasn\u2019t a single lie! Otherwise, may lightning strike me on the spot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi didn\u2019t speak, and it wasn\u2019t clear if she actually believed him. She spun the gun in her hands until it almost became an indistinct blur.</p><br/><p>My great ancestor! Be careful not to accidentally set it off!</p><br/><p>Zhang Jiang was about to pee his pants from watching her. Trembling with fear, he asked hurriedly, \u201cIf\u2026 If you want me to lie and testify that it was that person\u2026 that it was Ning Xueluo who paid me to do it\u2026 I can do that! Without conditions! I\u2019ll do everything you want unconditionally! The instigator can be whoever you want it to be!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lies?</p><br/><p>What she wanted was conclusive proof!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pointed the gun barrel at his chin and spoke, \u201cGive me the account number that the other party used to wire you the money and all the emails they sent as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. They\u2019re on my computer, I\u2019ll go grab it right now! However, the emails are anonymous and even the bank account is an anonymous overseas account. They\u2019re probably useless even if I give them to you\u2026\u201d As he spoke, Zhang Jiang fished out a laptop from underneath his blanket. Next, he showed her the other party\u2019s emails and wire transfer details.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glanced over everything. After confirming that there were no issues, she said, \u201cThis computer is mine now. Do you have any objections?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jiang shook his head violently, \u201cNo, no. My great ancestor, please go ahead and take it! Take whatever you want to take!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sneered. Hah. He had gone from calling her \u2018big sister\u2019 to \u2018great ancestor\u2019.</p><br/><p>With a scoundrel like this, even if you tried to reason with him, he would never listen. If you tried to negotiate with him, he would be insatiable: give an inch, and he\u2019ll take a mile. If you tried to play tricks, he would become even more cunning. Therefore, the only method left was to counter violence with violence.</p><br/><p>This was actually her first time using this gun after returning to this country. It was impossible not to be nervous, but at least she was skilled at acting. As long as she pretended that she was acting, she could calm down instantly.</p><br/><p>She had casually chosen to play the role of a homicidal maniac. It looked like she had gotten a pretty good result.</p><br/><p>Acting was her beloved profession, as well as her way of protecting herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, great ancestor, is there anything else you need?\u201d Zhang Jiang nervously gulped when he saw that she still didn\u2019t have any intention of leaving.</p><br/><p>With a sharp gaze, Ning Xi sized him up as if thinking about something, \u201cYeah\u2026 Let me think for a bit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink\u2026 think about what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m thinking about\u2026 whether I should kill you to eliminate any witnesses. What if you tell someone else that I forced you to give your confession after this?\u201d Ning Xi used a very natural tone and she looked extremely serious.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jiang nearly knelt in front of her as he lost all strength in his legs, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! I wouldn\u2019t dare to do that even if you gave me nerves of steel!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was speaking the truth. It was in his nature to bully the weak and fear the strong. This time, Ning Xi had scared him out of his wits.</p><br/><p>He really never expected that this seemingly weak and delicate young lady would have such a terrifying side to her. He didn\u2019t even dare to look directly into her dark and sinister eyes, in fear that he would have nightmares at night.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi laughed lightly and used the gun barrel to pat his cheek, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t kill you, I\u2019ll even give you money.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

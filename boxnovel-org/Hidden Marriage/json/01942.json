However, he just did not want to call her out. He pinched the space between his eyebrows. \u201cRelease the news about Zixuan stepping into Hollywood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru finally regained some confidence and she nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right, CEO Wang! No matter how good Ning Xi is, she\u2019s just well known in China! Zixuan has debuted for just a year and she\u2019s already stepping into Hollywood in a big movie of one of the top producers, Jace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Ning Xueluo was not at the meeting because Su Yan had called her in the morning and told her that he had something to talk to her about during dinner that night.</p><br/><p>After knowing him for so many years, she knew what it was from Su Yan\u2019s tone.</p><br/><p>Not only was what she did for the past few days not working, but he was further determined to divorce her!</p><br/><p>He was probably going to tell her about his decision that night.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo had just finished putting on her makeup in front of her dressing table. Thinking about it, her fingernails sank deep into her palms.</p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Xueluo out yet? Didn\u2019t Su Yan say he\u2019d tell her tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun looked upstairs from time to time. Apparently, she knew that her son was going to tell Ning Xueluo everything that night.</p><br/><p>She felt a lot more confident talking to her friends when she thought about how she would become in-laws with the Zhuang family in the future. Deep down, she wished that everything would go smoothly tonight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHongguang, do you think Xueluo will do anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang replied, \u201cWell, she\u2019ll surely try to do something! But we\u2019ve never mistreated her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun was triggered. \u201cMistreated? Not only did we not mistreat her in the past year, we were tricked by the Ning family! Do you know what the others are saying about us?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a few days ago, Shanshan\u2019s parents told me right in my face that Su Yan found a rural village woman as his wife! Do you want Su Yan to stay humiliated his whole life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang looked helpless. \u201cI didn\u2019t even say anything. Why did you bring it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever happens, we need to fully support Su Yan. If Xueluo truly loves Su Yan, she should be considerate about his future!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Zheng Mingjun and Su Hongguang were talking quietly downstairs, a maid\u2019s scream came from upstairs suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Madam! Madam, what happened?! Wake up! Oh no\u2026 Someone! Someone, please! Madam has passed out!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were shocked when they heard the young maid shrieking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Xueluo\u2019s fainted?\u201d Zheng Minjun frowned.</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang\u2019s expression changed as well.</p><br/><p>The two of them rushed over and saw Ning Xueluo passed out beside the dressing table. The maid was on the verge of tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Why would she suddenly pass out?!\u201d Zheng Minjun asked.</p><br/><p>The maid looked terrified. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 I just came in to deliver the clothes\u2026 and then I saw that Madam was already on the ground!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly ask the chauffeur to send her to the hospital!\u201d Su Hongguang ordered.</p><br/><p>He then added, \u201cCall Su Yan to come back too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun\u2019s expression looked terrible. She wanted to say something but stopped when she saw Ning Xueluo on the ground.</p><br/><p>She was thinking to herself, \u201cShe\u2019s fainted? Why now of all times?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

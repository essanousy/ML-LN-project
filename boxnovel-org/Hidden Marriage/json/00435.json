He tried to stop her from saying any further but it was already too late\u2026</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man only glanced at Liang Biqin dismissively, then he shifted his attention to the owner of Jade Treasury. He was different from how he treated Ning Xi earlier. His aura was imposing and any trace of friendliness in his voice had vanished. He questioned, \"Why was I not informed about the taking of these goods off display?\"</p><br/><p>The owner could not take it anymore, and stammered in terror, \"Manager Yu, I...it\u2019s not what you think...I didn\u2019t mean it that way\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Su Yimo and Liang Biqin\u2019s group were shocked to see the owner cowering in fright.</p><br/><p>Liang Biqin, who was still scolding the man a while ago was particularly stunned. \"Manager...Yu\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Su Yimo\u2019s expression changed as well. His surname is Yu...could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>The artistes whispered to each other.</p><br/><p>\"What...this worker...uh, no...this man is the manager?\"</p><br/><p>\"What manager?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t know! Could it be...the CEO of the Jade Treasury franchise, Yu Wannian?\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Hearing the name Yu Wannian, Liang Biqin\u2019s face went pale and she whispered, \"Impossible!\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the owner was trying his best to explain himself, \"Manager Yu, I don\u2019t mean that I\u2019m taking them off display permanently. It\u2019s just that there weren\u2019t enough workers today, so I thought of this!\"</p><br/><p>\"Not enough workers?\" the middle-aged man glanced at the few workers standing around.</p><br/><p>The owner knew that he was not able to get himself out of this one, so he went closer to the man and spoke in a hushed tone, \"Manager Yu, this Ms. Su is a VIP and I had to treat her with extreme care!\"</p><br/><p>He then gave him a meaningful glance, seeking for his understanding.</p><br/><p>Liang Biqin\u2019s groupies broadened in pride after hearing the owner's flattery.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, who cares if you\u2019re the CEO? Even the CEO has to give way to my cousin!\"</p><br/><p>Su Yimo stared at Liang Biqin, \"Don\u2019t be rude.\"</p><br/><p>Although she stopped her, she did not show any signs of displeasure.</p><br/><p>Liang Biqin did not care about anything anymore, and she started yelling, \"Hey, you\u2019re the CEO Yu Wannian, right? I know that you have your responsibilities, but the owner was just trying to serve us. After all, you should know my cousin here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Right, how much of a big deal is this?!\"</p><br/><p>The owner saw that Liang Biqin was helping him, and he peered over at Su Yimo with his hopes high up.</p><br/><p>Seeing the owner\u2019s SOS signal, Su Yimo sipped her tea and said, \"The owner was just trying to be nice, we\u2019ll let this slide off. No more next time.\"</p><br/><p>\"There, my cousin said so, did you hear that?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The middle aged man did not change the way he looked at Su Yimo\u2019s posse. He averted his sight to the jade bracelet that was held by Liang Biqin, \"Miss, I wonder if this bracelet has been paid for already?\"</p><br/><p>Liang Biqin said without hesitation, \"Pay? The owner gave this as a gift to my cousin!\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man looked at the owner broodily and reprimanded him harshly, \"You ignored our system, taking off goods on display on your own! Neglected Jade Treasury\u2019s motto, and even asked the security to chase off a customer! Disregarded your professionalism, by giving away a two million dollar bracelet! How dare you, Fong Maocai?! Who gave you such authority? Jade Treasury's reputation of a hundred years was almost ruined by you!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Otherwise, even if she and Lu Tingxiao could handle the two people, Little Treasure was there too. If there was the slightest mishap, she dared not imagine the consequences.</p><br/><p>With the white tiger there, there should not be any issue for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get Tang Lang to come over. It\u2019s best if you don\u2019t leave the house for the next few days,\u201d said Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded. \u201cMmm, send Little Treasure to the old residence! You too, be very careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party\u2019s target was clearly there. Obviously, Lu Tingxiao could be implicated along too.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 They were undisturbed for two days. The other party did not seem to have plans of ambushing again; they were probably preparing for the next attack.</p><br/><p>Instead, it was Han Xiao who came uninvited.</p><br/><p>When the white tiger saw Han Xiao, it was very excited. It immediately ran towards Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019ve been eating quite well!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw that white tiger had ample energy, Han Xiao laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that depends on who\u2019s taking care of it. Why don\u2019t you just give it to me to raise? That way, it doesn\u2019t need to brave the winds with you!\u201d The longer Ning Xi looked after it, the more she was reluctant to part with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t do.\u201d Han Xiao shook his head.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was just casually mentioning it as she knew that Han Xiao definitely would not agree to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Master!\u201d Suddenly, Ning Xi pulled Han Xiao\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Do you want to treat me to a meal?\u201d Han Xiao shot her a look from the corner of his eye.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi instantly choked.</p><br/><p>Could he stop only thinking about eating? It really affected his glorious image!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this, Master. I\u2019ve been targeted by assassins. The night before, someone even invaded Deer Town to ambush me\u2026 Master, please protect me, please!\u201d Ning Xi said with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I still have things to do,\u201d Han Xiao rejected firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it an emergency?\u201d Ning Xi thought that if it caused trouble for him, she obviously would not push it further.</p><br/><p>\u201cKFC has released a new set meal. I want to go line up for it,\u201d said Han Xiao with a straight face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Master, please don\u2019t mess with me anymore. In fact, how can you not keep your word?!\u201d Ning Xi complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot keep my word?\u201d Han Xiao was confused.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi dug around and immediately took out the whistle that Han Xiao had given her back then. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say then that you would agree with me on one thing? To consider returning me a favor! Then, you gave me this whistle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thankfully, this whistle was still around. After the incident, Lu Tingxiao had helped her retrieve it back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I already return the favor? I saved you the last time!\u201d Han Xiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ning Xi shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t blow the whistle the last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if it wasn\u2019t you that blew it? I still saved you.\u201d Han Xiao\u2019s expression was very matter-of-fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I ask you to save me?\u201d Ning Xi retorted. / update by </p><br/><p>Han Xiao thought about it earnestly, then he said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it wasn\u2019t me who blew the whistle, and it wasn\u2019t me who asked you to save me\u2026 then how can this favor be considered returned? Master, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d Ning Xi grinned, her expression even more justified.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Han Xiao said subconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I knew you were reasonable!\u201d Ning Xi instantly praised Han Xiao endlessly.</p><br/><p>If she could let Han Xiao guard the area, she would not need to be afraid of any assassins!</p><br/><p>So, no matter what, she had to trick the Master to stay!</p><br/><p>Han Xiao had wanted to argue, yet he was tongue-tied.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was not wrong at all. The whistle had not been blown by her, and she had not begged for him to save her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t feel right\u2026\u201d Han Xiao stared blankly at this girl opposite him.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi said, \u201cI\u2019ll get people to line up and buy you the new set meal right away. I\u2019ll send it over within half an hour!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao responded instantly, \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

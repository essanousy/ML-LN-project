We\u2019re currently taking care of this matter. It\u2019ll be settled by tomorrow night at the latest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat matter?\u201d The man\u2019s cold and distant voice sounded from the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? That is\u2026 Su Yimo\u2019s drunk driving incident\u2026 You\u2019re not looking for me because of that?\u201d Liang Feixing was confused. So the boss hadn\u2019t called this late at night to interrogate him about the matter?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing immediately heaved a sigh of relief. His brain was fried from working too hard. CEO Lu had never interfered with Golden Age\u2019s business. Even though this incident involved Golden Age\u2019s top female actress, Su Yimo, and was a huge matter to them, it was most likely nothing in Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>So why was the big boss looking for him at this time?</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing started getting even more uneasy, \u201cThen you\u2019re looking for me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet Jia Qingqing to retire from the entertainment circle in the next 24 hours.\u201d Lu Tingxiao immediately set down an order.</p><br/><p>\u201cJia Qingqing? CEO Lu, which Jia Qingqing do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStarlight Entertainment.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the voice had finished speaking, Liang Feixing\u2019s face was full of surprise. The Jia Qingqing whose looks were only above average, but had been billed as \u2018The Entertainment Circle\u2019s #1 Beauty\u2019 by Starlight?</p><br/><p>He had been wondering which big shot the boss had meant!</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing\u2019s face was full of bewilderment, but he didn\u2019t dare to say another word. He agreed, \u201cGot it, CEO Lu. I understand! As far as I know, Jia Qingqing has been having a catfight with one of the female artistes in the same company. Her opponent isn\u2019t someone easy to deal with and has already collected a lot of blackmail material on Jia Qingqing. She even knows how to get someone else to do her dirty work. She handed over all the material to our company to create a scandal video. Jia Qingqing offended too many people, there are many people waiting to hit her once she\u2019s down, I estimate that she won\u2019t be able to escape so easily. However, we need a bigger fire to chase her out of the entertainment circle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it in secret.\u201d Lu Tingxiao warned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, rest assured, CEO Lu!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up the call, Liang Feixing immediately handed over all his tasks to the vice director and personally handled this matter.</p><br/><p>This matter was no challenge at all. Having him work on it was like using a guillotine to kill a chicken. The artiste fighting with Jia Qingqing had already completed 80% of the work, so he only needed to give it the final push.</p><br/><p>However, Jia Qingqing was just a second-rate artiste. What had she done to have the big boss personally give the order for execution?</p><br/><p>No matter how Liang Feixing guessed, he probably couldn\u2019t guess that Lu Tingxiao\u2019s true aim wasn\u2019t to block Jia Qingqing from the entertainment circle, but to support a little actress whose name he probably didn\u2019t even know, Ning Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>The next morning.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi woke up, she was a little stupefied. Why was she lying in the Lu residence?</p><br/><p>She had clearly played games with Little Treasure for two hours straight, then she had fallen asleep on the sofa in Jiang Muye\u2019s living room out of fatigue afterwards\u2026</p><br/><p>While in a daze, a bang sounded from the window behind the bed.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suffered a fright, and hurriedly climbed up to check what was happening.</p><br/><p>When she opened the window, she saw a golden head of hair below\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s head was full of sweatdrops, \u201cJiang Muye, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye, who had always cared the most about his image, was actually still wearing the same clothes from last night. By this time, his outfit was all wrinkled, and his hair was messy. He said impatiently, \u201cNing Xi, come down right now! I have something to tell you! Quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed, feeling a headache coming on. She knew that nothing good would come of this guy knowing where she lived. As expected, he had come to throw stones at her window at such an early hour in the morning.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

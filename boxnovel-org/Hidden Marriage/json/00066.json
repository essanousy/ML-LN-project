She lowered her voice and said, \u201cI was about to ask you! How do you know Lu Tingxiao?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201cI\u2019ve already said that he\u2019s my uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye: \u201cWell, you never asked!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how do you know my uncle?\u201d Jiang Muye\u2019s gaze alternated between the two of them. The more he looked, the more he felt that something wasn\u2019t right, but he couldn\u2019t pinpoint where exactly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u2026\u201d Ning Xi held her forehead, feeling fatigued in both body and heart. Those four words were directed towards Jiang Muye, and were also a reply to Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye had an expression of being full of questions, but with Lu Tingxiao present, he couldn\u2019t speak up.</p><br/><p>Since she had just finished showering, a nice fragrance was wafting off the girl\u2019s body. Two slender, white legs were stretching out from under that baggy t-shirt. One hand was still attempting to cover the hole in the shirt, but it was only making the hole even more conspicuous. This kind of scene sent the blood boiling. The thought of Ning Xi appearing like this in another man\u2019s house sent Lu Tingxiao into a state where he wanted to obliterate everything.</p><br/><p>Even though he had already gone on a rampage in his heart a few times, it had only happened within the span of a few seconds. However, it only showed as a cold expression on Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face. He looked askance at Ning Xi and said, \u201cAre you preparing to stay here, or go back with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>That calm, indifferent sentence held an unseen pressure.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye looked at Ning Xi with an expression full of shock and disbelief upon hearing that.</p><br/><p>What did he mean by that??? These two weren\u2019t just acquainted, but were even living together?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the frosty cold Lu Tingxiao, then looked at Jiang Muye, whose eyes were spitting fire. She swallowed her saliva with difficulty, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll go back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold aura around Lu Tingxiao\u2019s body lessened by two points.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Muye threw a temper on the spot. He suddenly grabbed Ning Xi\u2019s wrist. That pair of extremely good-looking light blue eyes were full of nervousness and anger from getting deceived, \u201cYou promised to be with me tonight!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he finished speaking, Ning Xi was on the verge of punching him into the sky. Could you not make it sound like there\u2019s something between us, young man?!</p><br/><p>She raised her head to look at Lu Tingxiao. As expected, that scary expression had reached the point where he could no longer hold it back, as if there was just one last metal bar left before the beast would immediately burst out\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took back her hand while she held onto her patience and persuaded, \u201cMuye, I need to go to work tomorrow. Didn\u2019t Ming-ge say that you had something to do tomorrow morning? Let\u2019s wait till we\u2019re both free, then I\u2019ll come back and play games with you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi placed special emphasis on the words \u2018play games\u2019.</p><br/><p>Saying so, she quickly took up her large black duffel bag, covered the hole at her waist, and escaped this forsaken land as if she was fleeing for her life, without even stopping to change out of the shirt.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao sent a meaningful look to Jiang Muye before following Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>After seeing the two leaving one after another, and with Lu Tingxiao\u2019s look before he had left, fire burned deep in Jiang Muye\u2019s eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>Damnit! No wonder that woman had known so quickly that the road was blocked\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi, how much have you been hiding from me!</p><br/><p>Currently, Ning Xi was trembling with fear and trepidation as she walked back. Her hands were suddenly lightened of their load- Lu Tingxiao was helping to carry the bag in her arms.</p><br/><p>Following that, something heavy fell on her shoulders as Lu Tingxiao took off his jacket and placed it on her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Ning Xi thanked him awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had no reaction.</p><br/><p>It would have been better if he had some reaction. As long as he reacted, then she would have some way to deal with it, but it was this kind of non-reaction that would make people feel nervous\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

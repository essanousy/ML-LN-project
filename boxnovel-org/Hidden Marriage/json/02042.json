It had really been him! He was really lucky!</p><br/><p>There was a fierceness in David\u2019s eyes. The initial shock and panic slowly turned into disdain and fearlessness.</p><br/><p><em>Haha, Ah Ze, we haven\u2019t seen each other for two years, yet you are still naive as you have always been!</em></p><br/><p><em>You think that just based on Spirit, you can topple me?</em></p><br/><p><em>You think that just because you said Rainbow Feathers was your design, everyone would believe you?</em></p><br/><p>Everything was just as David had expected.</p><br/><p>Not only did the crowd look at Gong Shangze with odd gazes, even the Chinese fans in the live stream channels started to say blatantly mean things.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Where did this person pop up from!? He\u2019s probably gone insane from wanting to be famous. Forget that they\u2019ve always been copying History\u2019s style! Now, he actually straight up said that these clothes\u2019 designs are his and that he made them himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow shameless! If it were not for History exposing the Chinese style to the world, how would Spirit have a chance to leech on and be invited to an international fashion week?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo humiliating all the way abroad! Quickly get lost from Fashion Week. Don\u2019t humiliate us anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the scoldings, some rational Netizens pointed out suspicions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there some kind of inside story? Even if Spirit\u2019s designer had the slightest common sense, they wouldn\u2019t have said such baseless things at an event like this, would they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, Spirit\u2019s clothes are quite nice too. This time they managed to get an invitation to Lorraine Fashion Week, which means that Spirit has been internationally recognized. There\u2019s really no reason for them to do something like this, is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Discussions similar to those were very quickly been shot down by History\u2019s supporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think a counterfeit copycat designer would have a thing such as common sense? He\u2019s foolish himself, and he really thinks we\u2019re fools too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t design anything for a whole year. Recently, all their works have been following History\u2019s style. Even their design that won the Golden Award back then copied and referenced History!</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the counterfeit has had a taste of success, they won\u2019t be satisfied with small wins now. They straight up said that History stole his works! How can there be such a shameless person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the moment, discussion was abound at the venue too. They looked at Gong Shangze with strange gazes.</p><br/><p>One reporter asked, \u201cMr. Gong, earlier you said that Rainbow Feathers is your design. What do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze replied, \u201cIt means what it says. Rainbow Feathers is mine. David stole my work. Not just Rainbow Feathers, \u2018Spring Garden\u2019 was my design too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d The journalist was utterly confused.</p><br/><p>Did he just say that \u2018Spring Garden\u2019 that David had stunned the international fashion industry with two years ago was his design too?</p><br/><p>\u201cLotus Flower Breaks The Surface, Forest, Late Autumn\u2026\u201d Gong Shangze listed out more than ten of History\u2019s themed series at a go, and every series\u2019 timeline of release. Finally, he said, \u201cAll of these were from the design drafts that David has stolen from me!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the corner, when David heard Gong Shangze\u2019s words, he almost laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>That expression of his spelled pity and regretful as if he was looking at a pitiful creature making the final struggle even though he knew he was about to die.</p><br/><p>Huh, he just knew that this idiot was not one to be afraid of. He did not even need to make a move. He could already play himself to death.</p><br/><p>Today, this designer from Spirit named Gong Shangze had said things that were terribly shocking.</p><br/><p>He was saying that the leading figure of Oriental style, the one that even the fashion guru had praised was a genius designer, David, and all of his classic works were actually stolen?</p></div>\n</div>"}

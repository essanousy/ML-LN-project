Isn\u2019t he a little too good at making girls happy? What will we do when he grows up! I don\u2019t even dare to imagine how much I\u2019ll be wrapped around his little finger if he could talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Especially that last line, it had poked her right in her soft spot.</p><br/><p>He had actually called her a princess\u2026</p><br/><p>She had always wanted to become a queen, because that was the only way she could face all the tough and dangerous times she had gone through without fear.</p><br/><p>When looking at the \u2018princess\u2019 word that Little Treasure had written, the young girl\u2019s heart that had been buried deep within her had been drawn out\u2026</p><br/><p>Would any girl not want to be a carefree princess? She simply had no other choice.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at his son with laments in his heart. This had already gone beyond inheritance: his son had already surpassed him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Little Treasure standing there with a serious expression, looking up at her, Ning Xi could only chuckle helplessly before bending down to hug him, \u201cAlright, alright! I get it! I know that I\u2019m the most beautiful person in your eyes! I won\u2019t undervalue myself from now on, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only then that Little Treasure was satisfied. Copying how she usually rewarded him, he placed a gentle kiss on her cheek.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi couldn\u2019t resist hugging the little bun and snuggling her cheek against his, \u201cAh, what should I do? I really want to steal you away when your dad isn\u2019t looking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure blinked a few times, and looked like he was looking forward to it. He even nodded in approval, as if saying: Hurry up and steal me away!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cPfft\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Why did he have the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of being a third wheel?</p><br/><p>At the same time, in Ning Xueluo\u2019s ward.</p><br/><p>Since the reporters weren\u2019t able to catch Ning Xi, they could only return to interviewing Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>Everyone was going crazy looking for Ning Xi now, but she seemed to have evaporated off the face of this world. There wasn\u2019t even a trace of information about her, the reporters couldn\u2019t find her at her apartment, the set, or even her company.</p><br/><p>If they found out that Ning Xi had been staying on the same level as Ning Xueluo, and had even had a brief encounter with them just now, they would probably go mad.</p><br/><p>Out of concern for Ning Xueluo\u2019s health, Su Yan interrupted them after they had asked a few more questions, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, everyone. Xueluo is still injured and her body\u2019s still a little weak. Let\u2019s stop today\u2019s interview here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes, my body isn\u2019t too well. I\u2019m sorry to disappoint everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the reporters weren\u2019t too happy, they could only express their understanding and pass on their well wishes before leaving.</p><br/><p>Chang Li escorted them out politely, \u201cThank you for your concern towards Xueluo, everyone. I believe that everyone understands what is just and fair, and that everyone has a measure in their heart. It wasn\u2019t easy for all of you to come over on such a hot day, this is a little convenience fee for everyone\u2019s efforts!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, the assistant Cui Caijing started handing out red envelopes filled with money to each of them.</p><br/><p>The reporters were well aware of what was going on. They each expressed that they would definitely demand justice for Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>On the hospital bed, Ning Xueluo seemed to have thought of something as she displayed her suspicions on her face, \u201cYan-gege, what happened to the reporters just now? Why did all of them suddenly run outside? Did Ning Xi really come over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. They got the wrong person.\u201d Su Yan pulled her covers a little higher absent-mindedly.</p><br/><p>Most of those reporters had never seen Ning Xi in person, but he was different. Just now, he had caught a blurry glimpse of that figure and she did look like Ning Xi. He was practically certain that she really was Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>But how could that be possible? Why would Ning Xi be so intimate with a man, with a kid beside them?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

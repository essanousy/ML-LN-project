He said happily, \"Boss, like I said before, brand and popularity is one thing and business management is another. No matter how good their designer is, they aren\u2019t a threat to us!</p><br/><p>\"Now that you've seen it for yourself, you can relax now! The marketing department said that Lu Xinyan was a real amateur. All the business she has handled before failed in the end. That girl from Lu Corporation simply has no idea how a franchise works. She made money-losing promotions one after another, turning Spirit into another cheap brand now. When people stopped coming by after promotion period ended, she\u2019d start another promotion campaign again! Hahaha\u2026\"</p><br/><p>David guffawed heartily.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo wore a long dress. She looked outside the window with a sneer.</p><br/><p>They thought they had gained a solid supporter and tried to get involved with Lu Corporation through Lu Xinyan. Great! Instead of gaining, they have lost a lot more now!</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, she already expected that this would happen with Lu Xinyan. It was nothing to be surprised about.</p><br/><p>\"Oh yes, I\u2019m here today to ask you something. Have you heard of this person?\" Ning Xueluo passed David an Italian fashion magazine.</p><br/><p>David\u2019s eyes glowed when he saw the designs on the cover, but when he saw a vague face of the designer, his expression changed.</p><br/><p>\"Han Xiao\u2026?!\"</p><br/><p>Although the picture was not clear, he could tell that it was him.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know him?\" Ning Xueluo asked when she saw the obvious change in his expression.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, this Han Xiao is a Italian-born Chinese...h-he\u2019s a madman!\" David seemed to be reminded of something scary and his forehead was full of sweat. \"I went to Italy to study for a period of time before. Although Han Xiao was impressive, he has a bad reputation. He betrayed his own teacher, always had extreme mood swings, and he only does whatever he likes!\"</p><br/><p>David had heard a lot about Han Xiao before. Although he was a newbie in the fashion design industry, everyone called him \"The Demon\". However, he disappeared a long time ago as his interest in design did not last long. He quit after his interest fizzled out.</p><br/><p>He could recognize the man because he had met him personally before at a gathering in Italy and his friends had told him about Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s great then. I heard he came to China recently. He's right in our city! Help me look for him.\" Ning Xueluo grinned.</p><br/><p>Find Han Xiao?</p><br/><p>David shivered. Even if he met him, he would want to leave as far away as possible. Who would want to be with a madman?</p><br/><p>\"Boss, what're you saying?\" David felt uneasy. Why did Ning Xueluo want to find Han Xiao? Maybe\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I need him to help History get to the next level,\" Ning Xueluo said straightforwardly. However, there was a twist. \"But you can relax, you\u2019ll still hold your position. Since he\u2019s a madman, I\u2019ll probably just use him once or twice.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\" David smiled as he stood up and finished the wine in his glass.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

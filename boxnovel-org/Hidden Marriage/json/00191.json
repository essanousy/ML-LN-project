How dare you! Give me back all the cauliflower, cabbage, turnip greens in your hands! These plants are all my own species, I personally water and fertilize them. Everyday I play music for them, read them stories, and tell them jokes. They\u2019re my pride and joy! They\u2019re a hundred times more precious than gold! You haven\u2019t seen them grow as big or as juicy in anyone else\u2019s home. Putting it in general cuisine would be such a waste!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought he was growing them because he wanted to eat them. Besides, she never thought that Lu Jingli would have such a fantastic hobby\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPut them down immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked, \u201cIt\u2019s too late! I\u2019ve already picked them! Do you want me to give you money for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually dare to use money to insult my little babies! Ning Xi, I will fight you!\u201d Lu Jingli rolled his sleeves up and started rushing towards her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nervously pulled up Little Treasure, \u201cRun\u201d she shouted and the two ran away panting.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi headed towards the house door and started calling, \u201cLu Ting Xiao! Help-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome back, how did things go?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao asked, coming out of the house.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately grabbed Little Treasure and hid behind him.</p><br/><p>Just then Lu Jingli arrived and started complaining. \u201cBrother, you don\u2019t know but those two naughty children in your family actually went to my vegetable gardens and stole my food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cI sent them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Really now, behind the naughty children is a naughty parent!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are too much!\u201d Jingli shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t care how you do it but give my little babies back to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi poked her head out from behind Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s back, \u201cBut your little babies are already dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to say that?! I\u2019ll bury them and pray for their salvation! Isn\u2019t that enough?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I think eating them is also pretty good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you, you\u2026\u2026this cruel woman! I\u2019m going to beat you and die with you!\u201d the raging Lu Jingli started rushing over when suddenly a handsome robot appeared to block his way.</p><br/><p>Standing behind the robot was Little Treasure looking coldly at Lu Jingli, as if warning him not to bully his Aunt Xiao Xi.</p><br/><p>Looking at the three children plus a robot ready to fight, Lu Ting Xiao pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. \u201cLu Jingli don\u2019t cause trouble. Just come for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not want\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli started but suddenly smelt the aroma of delicious food.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Brother, didn\u2019t you make all the servants leave today? Then who made the food?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did!\u201d Ning Xi immediately raised her hand.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s face was one of total disbelief: \u201cYou can cook? Can we actually eat the food?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leading him to the table, the results were clear. The kitchen table was covered with dishes comparable to a restaurant\u2019s head chef causing Lu Jingli to be dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really made this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly took Lu Jingli\u2019s stolen vegetables and immediately fried them up.</p><br/><p>After witnessing it personally, Lu Jingli had to believe that, she had made the food. But, because he couldn\u2019t forgive the fact that she had stolen his food, he didn\u2019t give her any credit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! What year do you think this is? Thinking that you can get a man\u2019s heart through his stomach. I hope you\u2019re not thinking about those stupid words. Three inches below the belly button (the thing below the belt) is the key, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had no choice but to laugh. The fact that she and Lu Jingli were thinking the same way was really amazing!</p><br/><p>Though, the only one allowed to malign her is herself. How can she let others say that?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Is that so?\u201d Ning Xi tastefully raised one eyebrow, then picked up some rice and meat and stuffed it into Lu Jingli\u2019s mouth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

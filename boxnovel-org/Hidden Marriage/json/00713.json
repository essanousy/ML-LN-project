He had announced organizing a press conference.</p><br/><p>How efficient! He was probably terrified of the devil\u2026</p><br/><p>There were live feeds of the press conference online, it topped the headlines as the hottest topic going around.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi clicked on the video to play it.</p><br/><p>Reporter: \"CEO Hu, is your Weibo posting true?\"</p><br/><p>Hu Hongda: \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Reporter: \"Then, why did you clarify after that?\"</p><br/><p>Hu Hongda: \"Because I don\u2019t want to lie to my wife anymore, and I don\u2019t want to involve any innocent people! I\u2019m really sorry for what I\u2019ve done. I apologize to everyone.\"</p><br/><p>Of course, he dared not tell everyone that Lu Tingxiao had threatened him, so he found himself a more self-glorifying excuse...</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for him, this time, the public was not as forgiving.</p><br/><p>The number of shares of his Weibo post was rapidly rising and the comments section went crazy as well.</p><br/><p>[Wow! What\u2019s going on now? Ning Xi isn\u2019t the mistress? It\u2019s Fang Ya now? So, Hu Hongda framed Ning Xi to protect Fang Ya? How despicable!]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m so confused! The plot twist happened all too quickly!]</p><br/><p>[Ning Xi is innocent! She was blamed for doing nothing! He\u2019s going to just give her an apology? That's it? Ridiculous!]</p><br/><p>[Stop that \"I don\u2019t want to lie anymore\" crap. He was probably forced to clarify after someone found out!]</p><br/><p>[This man is the worst! Goddess Fangfang must never forgive him again! Not that he deserved forgiveness the last time!]</p><br/><p>[I think Fang Ya is the worst culprit here.She\u2019s probably the one who gave him the idea! I heard that she was always against Ning Xi. How evil of her!]</p><br/><p>[I felt sorry for Ning Xi. Just because she's pretty, she\u2019s always bring labeled as people\u2019s mistress!]</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had a bitter smile on her face. Was this incident a blessing in disguise? People would not believe in any rumors about her that easily next time\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, just below Ning Xi, in Ning Xueluo\u2019s apartment.</p><br/><p>\"Xueluo...save me...please save me\u2026\" Fang Ya could only plead repeatedly.</p><br/><p>On Ning Xueluo\u2019s computer was the live feed of Hu Hongda\u2019s press conference playing. Xueluo's face twitches with irate anger, she was close to exploding!</p><br/><p>How was this possible?! How?!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was on the verge of being destroyed! How did this happen?</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ya, what have you done? Why is Hu Hongda suddenly doing this? This doesn\u2019t make any sense!\" Ning Xueluo demanded angrily.</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t know! I really don\u2019t know! I followed what you said. I sent Ming Fangfang a message, then I just waited at home! I thought they would finally get a divorce, but I suddenly saw his post on Weibo. He betrayed me! Then, Ling Zhizhi revealed the affair between us online! I tried to call him but I haven't been getting through!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

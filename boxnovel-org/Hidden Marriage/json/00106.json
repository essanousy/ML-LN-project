Hearing so, she raised her chin unhappily, \u201cThen has she paid for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, she has yet to do so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t belong to anyone before it\u2019s paid for. I want this, ring it up for me right now!\u201d The lady in Chanel ordered as if it was a matter of course.</p><br/><p>Just as she had finished speaking, her hands were suddenly empty as the clothes flew back into Ning Xi\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>The lady in Chanel was immediately in a rage, \u201cWhy are you snatching my clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s tone was even more matter-of-course, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that it doesn\u2019t belong to anyone before it\u2019s paid for? You can snatch it away, but others can\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The lady in Chanel was about to throw a hissy fit, but she suddenly stared at Ning Xi\u2019s face in bewilderment, \u201cNing Xi\u2026 are you Ning Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if she had found something funny, the lady in Chanel pulled her companion over, \u201cXuanxuan, look who it is! It\u2019s that bumpkin from the Ning family, she\u2019s actually snatching clothes from me at a place like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi? How can it be\u2026\u201d Her companion looked at the woman before her with surprise. Her black hair fell in loose waves down her back, her makeup was perfectly done, and although the light purple sleeveless dress wasn\u2019t branded, it fit her personality well. Her whole person carried an elegant and noble air. There wasn\u2019t a single trace left of the weak country bumpkin from back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is her! I would never forget her face. Once a country bumpkin, always a country bumpkin. She only changed her appearance a little, but she still looks shoddy as always!\u201d The lady in Chanel said confidently.</p><br/><p>Her companion sized up the woman and found that it was indeed Ning Xi. Actually, Ning Xi\u2019s looks weren\u2019t too bad, even back then. She just didn\u2019t know how to dress herself and always looked rustic. The clothes she had been wearing at the banquet had been a size bigger, with a colour that was out of style. It was even a counterfeit dress, so it left a deep impression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing buying children\u2019s clothes? I didn\u2019t hear of her marrying anyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho know if it\u2019s some random man\u2019s bastard. Maybe she got pregnant before marriage! Back then, didn\u2019t Su Yan dump her because she cheated on him with some other guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It was only after those two women had been talking back and forth for a long while that Ning Xi finally recalled who they were.</p><br/><p>The lady in Chanel was Ying Fanglin and her companion was Jin Xuanxuan. They were famous socialites in upper society and part of Ning Xueluo\u2019s group of close friends. These two were also the ones who had mocked and teased her the most back then.</p><br/><p>She had later heard that Fanglin had married well and given birth to a son for her husband in the first year. Thus, she had become even more arrogant in her actions. Jin Xuanxuan also had a fiance with a good family background.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t thought that she would meet these bitches in the children\u2019s clothing department.</p><br/><p>It seemed like they still didn\u2019t know that she had entered the entertainment industry. Ning Xi didn\u2019t want to fight with these guys in public, so she just ignored them and spoke to the shop assistant: \u201cMiss, please help me ring these up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the other two ladies seemed like the wrong people to offend, since Ning Xi had picked the outfit first, the shop assistant quickly helped her to ring up the items and swipe her card.</p><br/><p>However, a problem arose when it came to swiping her card.</p><br/><p>The shop assistant\u2019s expression turned a little ugly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss, you don\u2019t have enough balance left on your card.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Ning Xi was struck dumb.</p><br/><p>It was only then that Ning Xi remembered, she had just changed the engine on her beloved bike to an imported one just last month, so there wasn\u2019t much money left on her card\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation, Ying Fanglin immediately jeered without restraint, \u201cHahaha, this is hilarious! You tried to show off when you don\u2019t have any money\u2026 you\u2019re just making a fool of yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Xuanxuan shrugged in disdain, \u201cI thought she might have improved a little after studying overseas for these few years. Well, I guess a crow will always be a crow, she\u2019ll never become a swan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Puffed up with self-importance, Ying Fanglin looked towards the shop assistant, \u201cMiss, you can finally give me the clothes now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, madam!\u201d As the shop assistant said so, she tried to take the clothes in Ning Xi\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held on and refused to let go.</p><br/><p>Ying Fanglin immediately cried out, \u201cWhat are you doing? You don\u2019t have any money and you\u2019re still trying to snatch it from me? Did you think that you\u2019re still in your village?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held onto the clothes with one hand and used her free hand to take out a black card from her bag, handing it over to the shop assistant, \u201cUse this one.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He understood Ning Xi, and he knew that what she hated the most was being tied down.</p><br/><p>A family background like the Lu family was most likely terrifying to her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you\u2019re done asking your questions. It\u2019s my turn to ask the questions now, right?\u201d Ning Xi crossed her arms and looked in askance at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye shrugged, \u201cWhat do you want to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought Lu Tingxiao only has a little brother, and doesn\u2019t have any sisters? Where did a nephew like you come from?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye lit up a cigarette and slowly spoke up, \u201cI\u2019m not related by blood to the Lu family. My grandparents were great friends with the Lu family, and they died in a car accident when my mother was very young, so the Lu family adopted my mother. Following the family hierarchy, I need to call Lu Tingxiao uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like that\u2026\u201d Ning Xi cast him an unhappy sideways glance as she spoke, \u201cI\u2019m trying to quit smoking! Don\u2019t tempt me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to quit smoking when you were fine before?\u201d Jiang Muye frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I need a reason to quit a bad habit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, who was it that told me: If I have alcohol today, I\u2019ll get drunk today. If I have a cigarette today, I\u2019ll smoke it today. Those who quit drinking and smoking are idiots\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye complained as he stubbed the cigarette, \u201cI\u2019ve already told you whatever I could. Did you have anything else you wanted to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf. Course!\u201d Ning Xi gritted her teeth and glared at him, \u201cTell me honestly, why did you take up the role of Sun Huanqing? Not only is it a second male lead, it\u2019s not even the type of role that you love to play usually!\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning in her words was that, this guy had done it on purpose to screw with her!</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye put on an innocent expression, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me taking a second male lead? Who made a rule saying that I can\u2019t? What\u2019s wrong with me taking Sun Huanqing? I wanted to try challenging myself by taking a role I don\u2019t normally do, is that not allowed? Isn\u2019t it meaningless to keep myself in a single type of role? Didn\u2019t I act pretty well today? You had so much fun teasing me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have fun, you idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was definitely going to be in tears by tomorrow\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m not going to play around with you anymore. I\u2019m going back since I promised Little Treasure that I\u2019d eat hotpot with him.\u201d Ning Xi hurriedly looked at the time on her phone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye looked unhappy, \u201cIs my uncle going to be with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course he is, I don\u2019t dare to take Little Treasure out on my own. Who\u2019s going to take responsibility if something happens!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, Jiang Muye was so angry that he wanted to hit something, \u201cSo you do know? Little Treasure is the entire Lu family\u2019s lifeblood, especially for his grandparents. They love him as dearly as their lives. If something happens, they might even bury you alive! Why would you take up such a hot potato?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wasn\u2019t happy upon hearing this, \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? What hot potato? My Little Treasure is so cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye sneered, \u201cI see that you\u2019ve been mesmerised by someone\u2019s looks! The moment he had a request for you, you immediately forgot about everything else!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him impatiently, \u201cFine fine. Stop nagging already, would you? Did you think that I would dare to reject the Great Demon King Lu\u2019s request? If it had been you, would you have dared to? Look at how afraid you are now, are you so worried that I\u2019ll become your aunt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2026Aunt\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye had been rendered completely speechless by the word \u2018aunt\u2019; he was in so much pain that he couldn\u2019t speak anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood boy!\u201d Ning Xi patted a certain doggy\u2019s head, and immediately skipped off after taking advantage.</p><br/><p>Taking up her bag and explaining to the rest of the crew that she wasn\u2019t free for the activities later that night, Ning Xi said her goodbyes and left.</p><br/><p>Watching the girl\u2019s figure hurriedly leaving the scene, a thick layer of frost gathered on Jiang Muye\u2019s face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

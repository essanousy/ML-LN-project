Shortly afterwards, she sneered inwardly. Ah, what was there to feel bad about? They had already reached this point!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly made up her mind, \u201cOkay, send the evidence to me and I\u2019ll go contact Ning Xueluo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to do it yourself. I\u2019ll do it for you so that no one will be able to trace your IP address.\u201d Lu Tingxiao responded.</p><br/><p>At this point, Ning Xi had started looking at Lu Tingxiao like he was a god. She spoke with starry eyes, \u201cGreat God Lu, this skill of yours is really too OP! Are you accepting any students?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s mood improved quite a bit upon seeing the worship in the girl\u2019s expression. He glanced at her, \u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s face was immediately filled with disappointment, \u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course he wasn\u2019t accepting any disciples! Big Boss Lu had so much to do on his plate everyday. How could he possibly accept any students\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stared at her with hidden meaning, \u201cIf you want to acquire this skill, there\u2019s actually a faster way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d Ning Xi asked with renewed energy.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><br/><p>If she married him, then everything that was his would become hers. She wouldn\u2019t need to learn anything then.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi broke out into a coughing fit and almost choked on her own spit.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t actually find any faults with this method of his\u2026</p><br/><p>But\u2026 was she getting flirted with again?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao enjoyed the girl\u2019s embarrassed expression for a moment before he asked, \u201cHave you thought about which company you\u2019ll join after terminating your contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rubbed her chin, \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m still thinking about that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking in an extremely casual tone, Lu Tingxiao said, \u201cAfter you prove your innocence this time around, your popularity will be on par with second and top tier actors. When the time comes, it\u2019ll be easy to find your next company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed, \u201cActually, it\u2019s quite troublesome. There won\u2019t be much competition if I want to enter a small company, but the future prospects are slim. Meanwhile, it\u2019s hard to get into a large company without some sort of background. It seems like I\u2019m getting a lot of exposure right now, but all of it is built on top of scandals. I don\u2019t even have a single completed project so I\u2019m in a pretty awkward position\u2026 Oh, Teacher Lu, do you have any suggestions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had already subconsciously started looking to Lu Tingxiao for his opinion when it came to making important decisions.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao poured her a glass of water and replied, \u201cFrom my perspective as a businessman, you\u2019re an investment with a lot of potential. I\u2019m interested in seeing the value you\u2019ll create in the future. Therefore, I hope that you can join Golden Age.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard his words, Ning Xi\u2019s eyes opened wide and it took her a long while to recover, \u201cEh, Big Boss, are you personally poaching me right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao chuckled, \u201cYou could put it that way. I really do want to poach you. Will you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn! Shouldn\u2019t that tone he was using be considered a foul?!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gulped and calmed herself down. She then spoke with a serious expression, \u201cTo tell you the truth, if all goes well and I can leave Starlight smoothly, Golden Age is the company that I would like to enter the most. Golden Age has already surpassed Starlight to become the industry\u2019s top entertainment company, and its future prospects are undoubtedly the best\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded with satisfaction and extended his hand, \u201cWell then, let\u2019s have a successful partnership.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Ning Xi subconsciously extended her hand, \u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 Let\u2019s have a successful partnership.\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2026 What just happened? They started working together just like that?</p><br/><p>She had already reached an agreement with Golden Age just like that?</p><br/><p>The great demon king was also pretty efficient at poaching people\u2026</p><br/><p>TL Note:</p><br/><p>OP = overpowered (gaming term)</p><br/><p>I used it to show how casual Ning Xi\u2019s tone is~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

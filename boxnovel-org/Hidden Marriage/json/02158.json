Who\u2019s giving the second question?\u201d Tang Lang suddenly got excited.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao looked among the girls and picked Zhuang Keer. \u201cKeer, come!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026 Me?\u201d Zhuang Keer walked out hesitantly. \u201cLet me think for a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Zhuang Keer said, \u201cHmm, my question is what\u2019s the dress that Xiao Xi wore during the Golden Film Awards?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not even need to think about it. \u201cNirvana Reincarnated series in maroon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxao was stunned. \u201cThat\u2019s it? Keer, you\u2019re too soft! That\u2019s too easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang seemed annoyed. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re the weird one? Do you think all girls are like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Keer then said, \u201cThis question isn\u2019t easy at all. Even a hardcore fan of Xiao Xi\u2019s might not be able to remember each and every dress Xiao Xi wore at different events.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao gave up, so they passed.</p><br/><p>There was only one more question left in the first level.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao looked over at Ning Tianxin. \u201cThird question. Take a guess at what Tianxin\u2019s favorite painting is! You have to guess it right on the first try!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang protested, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between this and the first question!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao rolled her eyes at him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t be a bully anymore! I\u2019ll get Tianxin to prepare an answer and I\u2019ll definitely let you guys pass if you get it correct!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli mumbled, \u201cThat\u2019s very difficult too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao raised her eyebrows. \u201cPlease! Think about who\u2019s inside the room! The top beauty of China, the National Goddess! It\u2019s worth that little bit of difficulty, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was speechless. Which side was his brother actually on?!</p><br/><p>He was really worried about his brother losing his own principles!</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli asked Qin Mufeng, \u201cHey Dr. Qin, you\u2019re the closest to the pretty lady here. Do you know the answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng seemed troubled. \u201cI know she likes Monet, but there are so many paintings of his. I don\u2019t know which one she\u2019d like!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli fell into despair. \u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think my brother has a solution for this too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTime\u2019s up! Are you guys done discussing?\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao had a little paper with Ning Tianxin\u2019s answer in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick! Anyone?\u201d Lu Jingli asked around.</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng seemed worried. This was related to a certain devil\u2019s happiness. If he messed it up, would he end up dead?</p><br/><p>\u201cSunrise? Picnic by the Graze? Or Sleeping Lotus? Sleeping Lotus seems to have a big chance\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d Qin Mufeng slowly closed in on Ning Tianxin. \u201cTianxin, can you give us some hint?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin seemed troubled. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao created a gap between them. \u201cWhat are you doing?! No seduction! Be more serious about it! I\u2019ll give you guys a ten-second countdown. You\u2019ll lose if there\u2019s no answer! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Let us think!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we get any hints for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a hoarse voice among the crowd \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cZero\u2019s \u2018Prison Cage\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Mo Lingtian.</p></div>\n</div>"}

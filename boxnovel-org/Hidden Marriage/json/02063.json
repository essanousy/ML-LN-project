The current leader is the weakest one in the history of their chiefs. Back then, his assistant almost seized the throne. Tang Xi, how did you get involved with Solomon\u2019s people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged innocently. \u201cI\u2019m really confused too! I don\u2019t know when could I have provoked them!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Feng Xiaoxiao waved her hands indifferently. \u201cWon\u2019t we know when we catch that idiot gang leader out to grill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>They reached the entrance to the headquarters.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang kicked the man with the skull necklace on the door, making a huge sound.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, there were sounds disarrayed footsteps. The people inside were startled and came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it!?\u201d A hefty Caucasian guy at least two meters tall rushed out. When he saw the man lying on the ground twitch, his expression darkened. \u201cJason! What\u2019s happening?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, his gaze looked at Ning Xi, Tang Ye, and the rest at the entrance with hostility. \u201cWho are you people!? You dare to even touch Solomon\u2019s people! Do you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jason heard his words, he instantly trembled with fright. \u201cJoseph, softer\u2026 Softer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he leaned into the guy\u2019s ear and muttered a few things softly, appearing terrified.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw the two people keep muttering to each other, Tang Lang impatiently yawned. \u201cWho\u2019s your leader? Get him to come out to speak!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard Jason\u2019s words, Joseph\u2019s gaze was much more cautious now. \u201cDo you think you can just meet our leader as you wish? The few of you, who are you? Report your names!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao waved the whip in her hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to know my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Joseph saw the whip in Feng Xiaoxiao\u2019s hand, his expression suddenly changed. In the next second, after he noticed the gold-framed spectacles on Tang Ye, he turned a few degrees paler. After he saw Tang Lang\u2019s almost symbolic curly hair too, his knees started to give way. \u201cYou\u2026 Could you be\u2026 Could you guys be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Crap!</em></p><br/><p><em>Could these people be </em>the legendary <em>\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>From their features, their aura, everything fit!</em></p><br/><p><em>It seemed like they only missed the \u201cThousand-Faced Ghost Hand\u201d Tang Xi\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>Uhh, could that beautiful lady who looked weak be Tang Xi in disguise?</em></p><br/><p><em>Who was that long-haired man beside the beauty then?</em></p><br/><p><em>If they were really the four, then would the man traveling with them not have an even more terrifying identity?</em></p><br/><p>Joseph almost did not dare to continue thinking about it.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, behind them came the pattering of heavy footsteps. A few people walked out with large steps.</p><br/><p>The person who walked right in front was a middle-aged man, and beside him was a bald man.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss!\u201d When they saw the middle-aged man, Joseph, Jason, and all the rogues immediately lowered their heads to call out respectfully.</p><br/><p>When Tang Lang saw their commander walk out, he raised his brows and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re Solomon\u2019s leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man had a stormy expression as he skimmed the five people who were clearly here to cause a scene.</p><br/><p>As he was about to speak, his gaze fell onto the girl who wore a pink dress and looked adorably delicate. In the next second, his expression suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>It was as if the middle-aged man had been split into half by a thunderbolt. His eyes widened and stared straight at Ning Xi, then his initially vicious eyes unexpectedly teared up akin to an abandoned pet that had seen its owner. He was emotional as he stared at Ning Xi and gasped, \u201cBoss! Boss, you\u2019ve finally returned!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Well, it\u2019s time for you to go now, it\u2019s late already. I\u2019ll ask a driver to send you back!\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s okay, Grandfather, a friend is here to send me back.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, be careful on the way back!\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, goodbye, Grandfather!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After bidding farewell to Grandfather and Ning Tianxin, Ning Xi rushed out with a giddy sort of happiness.</p><br/><p>Oh, to see the little bun! Precious little bun!</p><br/><p>As she reached the entrance, she almost bumped into Ning Yaohua, Zhuang Lingyu, and Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo went up to her as soon as she saw her. \"Sister, are you leaving now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\" Ning Xi grunted impatiently, the little bun was just right in front of her and she was being blocked, irking her greatly.</p><br/><p>\"Sister, it\u2019s difficult to get a taxi here this late. Why don\u2019t you wait for a little while? I\u2019ll have Bro Yan send you back after the banquet is finished!\" Ning Xueluo suggested because she knew that someone would definitely be someone against this idea.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu quickly pulled Ning Xueluo aside. \"Xueluo, you silly child, why are you so naive?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mother, it\u2019s really late now, it\u2019d be dangerous for Sister to go back alone!\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu signalled Ning Xueluo not to say another word, then she walked up to Ning Xi with an unkind expression and questioned her in a straightforward manner, \"Ning Xi, what are you trying to do?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi calmly crossed her arms and answered slowly, \"What do you think I\u2019m trying to do, Madam Ning?\"</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu sneered at her disdainfully, \"All you want is just money, isn\u2019t it? And here I was thinking how diligent you could be. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to join the company, but you\u2019re so ambitious that you only want to join the main company!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her eyebrows. \"I want to join the main company?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t you dare tell me that you didn\u2019t think about it! Otherwise, why would you do all the things you did today to please your grandfather? Always using all these tricks! Now that you know how difficult it is to survive in the outside world, you want to come back? It\u2019s too late!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the door of the Maybach opened slowly.</p><br/><p>When Zhuang Lingyu noticed the door opening, she totally ignored Ning Xi and pushed her behind, then nudged Ning Xueluo to the front. \"Seems like Assistant Cheng is coming down, Xueluo, go!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua was astounded to see the one disembarking from the car...was not Cheng Feng...it was...it was the Lu family\u2019s Second Master, Lu Jingli!</p><br/><p>Unlike the elusive Lu Tingxiao, Lu Jingli led a high profile life. His face was so well known that no one could ever mistaken it.</p><br/><p>The Lu family Second Master was here personally. What an honor!</p><br/><p>His heart was racing just thinking about the reactions of the guests, his father\u2019s shock and Ning Yaobang\u2019s jealousy when they all saw Lu Jingli\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They could use their acting to pressure the other person mentally, making the other act abnormally, forgetting their lines. The most intense pressure could even give the other a mental block that they would never be able to get over for the rest of their lives.</p><br/><p>There were extremely few people who could use this technique in the entertainment circle. Most importantly, it was very hard to see through this technique, because it was hard to tell if the other was simply acting well or was purposely using \u2018pressure acting\u2019. This technique could harm others without leaving a trace.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, \u201cI can\u2019t throw out my moves so casually!\u201d</p><br/><p>Firstly, she needed a specific situation to use this kind of move. For example, the scene today was perfect for suppressing Jia Qingqing. Secondly, this move would affect the progress of filming, so she definitely wouldn\u2019t use it unless she really had to.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye unconsciously remembered some unhappy memories and curled his lip as he said, \u201cThen I am very honoured to, be one of the few you unleashed this move on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Back then, he had been suppressed by Ning Xi using this move. However, he wasn\u2019t trash like that Jia Qingqing. He had eventually held on and had overcome the move, and his acting skills had even improved by leaps and bounds after that.</p><br/><p>After saying so, Jiang Muye stared at her with a burning gaze, \u201cAre we eating dinner together tonight? You promised me you\u2019d treat me alone! You also promised that you\u2019d play games with me another day!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Ning Xi who was in the wrong for this, so she sighed helplessly and said, \u201cFine fine fine, I\u2019ll eat with you and play with you, okay? I\u2019m just going to message Lu Tingxiao and let him know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s expression instantly changed upon hearing this, \u201cYou\u2019re only living in temporarily for Little Treasure, why do you have to report when you don\u2019t go back? What\u2019s the relationship between you and Lu Tingxiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I\u2019m sending a message to Lu Tingxiao, the recipient is Little Treasure, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was too lazy to bother with him. She looked down at her phone and typed a message: [My dearest darling, Auntie is busy tonight, so I might come back really late. Remember to eat your dinner and go to sleep. When Auntie is free, I\u2019ll buy cute clothes for you! Love you~ xoxo]</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye looked at that message and got so annoyed that his eyes turned red, \u201cWhy are you so gentle to Little Treasure! You were never this gentle to me when we were together, you kept beating me up whenever we quarrelled!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi cast a sideways glance at him, \u201cYou deserved all those beatings! Little Treasure is so cute, are you sure you can compete with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s beautiful eyes lit up like the blazing sun, \u201cNing Xi! Did you ever even like me back then? You really got close to me just to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at him with surprise, \u201cNonsense, of course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You you\u2026.\u201d Jiang Muye pointed at her and couldn\u2019t speak for a long while.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi propped up her chin and smiled at him: \u201cSo? Are you full from anger now? Are we still going to eat dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye gritted his teeth: \u201cWe\u2019re eating!!!\u201d He absolutely could not fall for her evil schemes!</p><br/><p>At the same time, in the Lu residence.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli sat on the sofa while hugging a pillow. If he had a tail behind him, it would be wagging up a storm, \u201cBro bro bro, tell me tell me, what happened last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of Ning Xi\u2019s words telling him to find a woman this morning, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression was still a little gloomy. He had no mood at all to satisfy Lu Jingli\u2019s curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because you couldn\u2019t control the burning love in your heart and lost control and went to attack her at night? And then you weren\u2019t careful with your actions and woke Xiao Xixi up? Then you were trapped on the spot, so you just pretended you were sleepwalking?\u201d Lu Jingli\u2019s ability to fill in the details wasn\u2019t just for show.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised his gaze and looked at him. This fellow\u2019s smarts were all used on things like this, weren\u2019t they?</p><br/><p>Seeing his dear brother\u2019s expression, Lu Jingli just knew that he had guessed it right. With an expression like he was about to fall in love with himself, \u201cHeavens! I\u2019m too smart! Bro, don\u2019t I know you so well?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

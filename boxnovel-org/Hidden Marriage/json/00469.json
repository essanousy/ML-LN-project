They probably could not find what they were looking for. Then, the leader pointed his index finger upwards at the second floor.</p><br/><p>When they saw that, the other men nodded in understanding and followed after their leader. They walked stealthily towards the second floor.</p><br/><p>Little did they know that from the moment they had walked in, their every move was being watched by a certain girl.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ning Xi thoroughly understood that this group of well-trained men were definitely not common robbers. If she guessed correctly, it was the enemies of that particular person; they had come to seek revenge now, neither for money, nor for a woman, but for life.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, that person was not at home, and instead, she would have to innocently take the shot now.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it, why does it always turn out like this?!\" Ning Xi gritted her teeth. She had faced a similar situation twice before, making today the third time. What a charm. That person's enemies were really all over the world. They probably had to deal with revenge seekers from time to time...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Ning Xi returned to the room and thought quickly. Then, she instantly picked up the cute cartoon figure and flicked the switch on before throwing it down the stairs.</p><br/><p>The leader went trigger-happy.</p><br/><p>It didn't take long for the cartoon figure's bottom half to be shot beyond recognition.</p><br/><p>The other half of the cartoon figure fell carelessly among the men.</p><br/><p>\"Oh...your shot, it really hurt my feelings!\" the cartoon figure started to say.</p><br/><p>The men looked suspiciously at the cartoon figure that had been shot into half.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the cartoon figure continued, \"Bro, did you grow up in the crematorium where they sell barbecue?\"</p><br/><p>\"This...this will be a massacre! Let's get some magic going first, how about that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn it!\" The lead man scowled then viciously crushed the figure that would not stop talking into pieces.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ning Xi's body flashed across the void.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's eyes were sharp as an eagle's and cold as ice. It almost seemed like she had become a whole different person.</p><br/><p>Anyone who did not know her well enough would definitely be shocked to see her now. The Ning Xi right now was like the Ning Xi from a few years ago. Her steely eyes held no fear of complicated emotions, but only precise calculations.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi fired the first shot, a loud sound rang across the entire building, and the lead man's miserable scream was heard.</p><br/><p>His breathing turned rapid as his body retreated backwards to avoid the attack. However, his attempts were as feeble as wet mud collapsing pathetically; Ning Xi's shot had hit him right in the heart.</p><br/><p>The other five men watched on in horror and did not even care about their leader who was shot. Instead, they separated to look for cover.</p><br/><p>At the same time, gunfire blasted another three times.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

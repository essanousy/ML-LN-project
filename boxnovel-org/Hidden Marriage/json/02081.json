When she saw Ning Xi, she eagerly greeted her.</p><br/><p>When she saw Ning Qiutong, Ning Xi\u2019s frown slowly relaxed. First, she called out to her grandfather and greeted him, then she walked towards Ning Qiutong. \u201cAunty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Qiutong carefully looked at her with concern. Moments later, she let out a sigh of relief. \u201cNot bad! You\u2019ve become a little chubby. You finally have some meat on your face!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw that Ning Xi had come and unexpectedly started to reminisce with Ning Qiutong, Ning Yaohua was so angry that his face twisted in fury. \u201cAnimal! Kneel down right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Noticing Ning Yaohua\u2019s resentful gaze as if he was looking at garbage, Ning Xi scoffed indifferently. \u201cI will kneel to heaven, kneel to earth, and kneel to my parents. I wonder on what basis are you asking me to kneel down for, Chairman Ning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua was furious. \u201cYou\u2026 you inhumane animal! Up until now, you\u2019re still trying to be clever!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, some of Ning family\u2019s relatives looked repulsed as they whispered to each other, \u201cLook what this girl is saying! Is this not her father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe dares to say such disgraceful things. Isn\u2019t she afraid of getting struck by lightning!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu had long wanted to run up and kill her the moment she saw Ning Xi. At this moment, her expression was even fiercer as she screeched, \u201cNing Xi! You cruel animal! You won\u2019t even let go of children! Back then, when I gave birth to you, I should\u2019ve just strangled you then and there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo wept until she was slightly breathless. She seemed absent-minded. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault\u2026 All my fault\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have clung onto Father and Mother\u2019s warmth\u2026 I\u2019ll return it to you\u2026 I\u2019ll return it all to you\u2026 Can you give me back my child, please? Return my child to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXueluo, Xueluo, my unfortunate daughter\u2026 It\u2019s not your fault\u2026 It\u2019s Mother who didn\u2019t protect you well. Back then, I should never have brought this animal back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As they watched the mother and daughter\u2019s misery and suffering, everyone around looked at Ning Xi with even more spite.</p><br/><p>\u201cSinful! Killing two children at a go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so pretty, but who would have thought she\u2019d be this malicious?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, silence!\u201d The elder thumped his staff hard.</p><br/><p>The clamor in the ward then gradually hushed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi, tell us what happened.\u201d The elder asked in a quiet tone.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua pressed angrily. \u201cFather, why are you still asking her this right now? First, she hired the murderer that killed Lingyu\u2019s child. Xueluo rushed to expose her, then she flew into a rage and poisoned Xueluo\u2019s water, wanting to kill Xueluo\u2019s child too!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis animal probably intended to harm Xueluo as well! The doctor said that it was an extremely strong medication to induce abortion. She even put three times the dosage, but Xueluo survived because she was lucky! She\u2019s practically inhumane!\u201d</p><br/><p>With every word that Ning Yaohua uttered, all the ruthless pairs of eyes fell on Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ning Xi being condemned and attacked by everyone, Ning Xueluo leaned weakly in Su Yan\u2019s embrace, the corners of her mouth strangely curled up. Her eyes fearlessly challenged Ning Xi to provoke her and inside her heart, she sneered madly.</p><br/><p><em>Ha, Ning Xi, defend yourself! Explain! This will be your final struggle!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

Should we postpone the wedding to another day?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was he saying now? A whole island full of guests were outside and he wanted to delay the wedding?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed, \u201cDarling, can you please calm down?\u2019</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao leaned over to his beautiful wife in her wedding dress. \u201cI can\u2019t. When I think about how you\u2019re having my baby, about how we\u2019re going to be together forever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi giggled. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao would never reject such request. He kissed the girl\u2019s forehead tenderly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled. \u201cI\u2019m all fine now. I\u2019m not tired anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli saw this exact moment when he came in and his manly tears fell. \u201cBro, are you done now? All the guests are waiting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre First Senior Brother and Third Senior Sister here already?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t really see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ning Xi seemed disappointed.</p><br/><p>She had contacted Tang Ye and Feng Xiaoxiao. Tang Ye\u2019s bunch was wandering somewhere as their schedule was always unstable, while Feng Xiaoxiao was probably carrying out a mission at the moment and was most likely not able to come.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll be here.\u201d Lu Tingxiao patted the girl\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>At that very moment, there was the sound of a loud chopper outside the window as a helicopter slowly descended from the sky. A person jumped straight out of it, not waiting for the helicopter to land. The figure came into the room through the window.</p><br/><p>With a sexy body, long, wavy hair, and a cool style, the person greeted, \u201cBaby!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Senior Sister!\u201d Ning Xi was surprised.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao started complaining the moment she saw Ning Xi. \u201cDamn, Little Junior Sister! Your husband is really something. He sent someone to take out my target and abducted me on a helicopter. I was dumbfounded and thought I got betrayed! But they told me that I was invited to your wedding! How exciting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glanced over at Lu Tingxiao. \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d She thought that Lu Tingxiao was just comforting her when he said that they would be there.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao went over and gave Ning Xi a big hug. \u201cHappy marriage! You look really beautiful today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Ning Xi felt a warmth spark in her heart.</p><br/><p>She did not have many friends, but each and every one of them was extremely important.</p><br/><p>After resting for a short while, Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao went outside to greet the guests.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations to the both of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The friends and families of both parties, Xu Tao, Liang Feixing, Qin Shuang, Qin Mufeng, Jiang Muye, and Mo Lingtian arrived one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi, where\u2019s your brooch?\u201d Ning Tianxin looked at Ning Xi\u2019s chest and asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked down. \u201cUhh\u2026 It was still here just now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you dropped it somewhere, but it\u2019s alright. There are some spares in the house. I\u2019ll go and look for one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin quickly went back to get another brooch. In her haste, She accidentally bumped into a person with a strong tobacco smell.</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin quickly apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The person she bumped into did not say a thing.</p><br/><p>Ning Tianxin looked up and was stunned.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian\u2019s cigarette fell to the floor as he looked at the girl in front of him. \u201cTianxin\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

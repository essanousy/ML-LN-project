There\u2019re been too many brands that followed that trend to count on my fingers. All of the elements that could be used have been used up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed so! Innovating and coming up with something new and different is extremely hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now that it\u2019s confirmed that David\u2019s previous designs were all from him, that means all of David\u2019s success will return to the original owner. As long as he exhibits his talent, as usual, it\u2019ll be enough for him to take his place in the international fashion industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, all of the lights around dimmed. The crowd\u2019s discussion instantly stopped too.</p><br/><p>Finally, on the T-shaped stage, the first model slowly floated from the backstage.</p><br/><p>It was a gown in a primary tone of navy blue with a wide cloak fanning out at the back. The warm sunset orange and inky color constructed an extravagant scene that was truly majestic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Dunhuang!\u201d Someone instantly cried out from the crowd.</p><br/><p>The colors and pattern elements on the ready-made outfit were from China\u2019s treasure trove that was the largest scaled and the most abundant in classical cultural art. It was also a world-famous Buddhist art centre \u2014 the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang!</p><br/><p>Very quickly, the second outfit appeared before the crowd.</p><br/><p>This outfit was a rich gold in color. The gown was embroidered with two soaring dragons that leaped high. As was common knowledge, the totem of a dragon symbolized China.</p><br/><p>Between the dragon patterns were embroidery of colorful clouds that had auspicious messages. On the train of the dress, there seemed to be rolling waves as if everyone\u2019s ears were filled with the sound of roaring seas to mean \u201ceternal peace and prosperity\u201d!</p><br/><p>The third outfit made use of China\u2019s even more classic Qinghua porcelain element. The entire gown\u2019s patterns perfectly copied a Qinghua porcelain vase from the Song Dynasty. It was accompanied with entangling branches of Qinghua, a dragon, <em>qilin </em>[1], phoenix, magpie, and more as ornaments.</p><br/><p>The fourth set was a body-hugging gown with a train in red. The gown was embroidered with a red-crowned crane and plum blossoms, instantly transporting everyone into China\u2019s vast wonderland.</p><br/><p>The fifth outfit, the sixth, the seventh\u2026</p><br/><p>One after another, ready-made outfits appeared before the crowd. Every set represented China\u2019s ancient and unique elements, stunning everyone until they gasped in amazement.</p><br/><p>No one would have predicted that this designer that appeared so gentle and harmless had such a shocking force within him. It was not just one outfit, but ten whole outfits that took everyone\u2019s breaths away!</p><br/><p>Off-stage, all the intuitive well-known buyers were already been wildly trying to find a way to contact Spirit. They were prepared to snap up Spirit\u2019s work this season as all the superstars around the world were already anticipating to put on these unique gowns.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is unfathomable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMad beautiful! Every outfit! Every outfit is so unique and unmatched!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this standard of design, even just one outfit would take several months. There are ten whole outfits here. How in the world did he do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Spirit\u2019s show ended with a high note of praise.</p><br/><p>Facing more and more exclaims of admiration, Gong Shangze said, \u201cWhy, almost all designers would meet with the predicament of dried up inspiration! However, I\u2019ve always felt blessed being a Chinese designer because in China\u2019s 5000 years of culture, there are endless inspiration and treasures to be unearthed!\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant Gong Shangze finished, the crowd broke into a thunderous applause.</p><br/><p>Those far away in China were even moved to tears.</p><br/><p>In the live stream channels, Gong Shangze\u2019s and Spirit\u2019s names plastered the screens!</p></div>\n</div>"}

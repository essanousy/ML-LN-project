Apart from filming, she would just be showering her affection all over her man\u2026</p><br/><p>When he arrived at the door to Lu Tingxiao's villa, a person suddenly rushed over and they both clashed.</p><br/><p>\"Oh! Second Uncle... What are you doing? Why are you in such a hurry?!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli picked up the documents from the floor one by one and quickly asked, \"I'm here for my brother. Why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm here for Ning Xiao Xi! Ling Zhizhi called me and said that she couldn't get in touch with her!\" Jiang Muye replied.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli's expression changed and he froze when he heard Ning Xi's name.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye frowned when he saw the change in Lu Jingli's expression. \"What happened?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli pinched the space between his eyebrows. He was not sure where he should begin.</p><br/><p>Too many things had happened lately and the whole Lu family was in a mess right now. Everyone was at a loss about what to do. They were just done with the Zhuang family. A lot of other things still had to be handled.</p><br/><p>Handling Ning Xi's career would be extremely difficult\u2026</p><br/><p>No one knew when Ning Xi would wake up, so what could they do with her career? How should they tell the media and her fans?</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye had never seen such a serious expression on Lu Jingli's face before. He became nervous and he asked, \"Second Uncle, what's wrong? Could it be... that she wants to break up with Uncle?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli took a deep breath and said, \"Xiao Xi Xi... Something happened to her... Little Treasure was kidnapped... She was injured gravely from rescuing Little Treasure... She's still unconscious after the surgery\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye's face went blank. He did not expect that something bad would have really happened to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\"What... What do you mean she's still unconscious?\" Jiang Muye's voice trembled.</p><br/><p>\"She's in a coma, a vegetative state. She needs to rely on a breathing machine to survive at the moment\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"How could it be? How could it be like this?! When did this happen?\" Jiang Muye still could not believe it.</p><br/><p>\"We brought her back the night before yesterday. The surgery was completed yesterday morning, and she's now being sent to the military sanatorium in the suburbs\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was stunned. His jaw went slack, but no words came out.</p><br/><p>The Lu family had locked down the news, so nothing had leaked out despite it being such a severe matter. Therefore, he only found out about it now!</p><br/><p>\"Bro!\" Lu Jingli saw Lu Tingxiao come out of the house.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao took the documents from Lu Jingli. At the same time, a black car stopped by the door. Lu Tingxiao boarded it swiftly and left a message. \"Go and get Ling Zhizhi and Xiao Tao. Send them to the sanatorium. I'll be there soon.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye then offered, \"Uncle, let me get them!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao contemplated his offer.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli gave Jiang Muye a pat on the shoulder. \"Thank you then, Muye. Remember to keep this a secret! We have to discuss how to work this out from now on. We're trying not to affect Xiao Xi Xi's career\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye nodded.</p><br/><p>After the car left, Jiang Muye stood there for some time before he called Ling Zhizhi. \"Hello, Zhizhi... Where are you and Xiao Tao? I'll go and get you guys!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

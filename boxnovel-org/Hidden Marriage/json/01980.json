She just raised her brows ever so slightly and thought to herself, \u201cHe would not be asking her to go settle his bills again, would he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, which KFC are you at? I\u2019ll go settle the bill right way,\u201d said Ning Xi very cleverly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to settle any bills,\u201d said Han Xiao on the other end of the phone.</p><br/><p>Could her luck be so fortunate this time around?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was shocked. \u201cThen, why are you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake my tiger away,\u201d said Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 Huh? What are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy eats up half a year of my food expenses in a day. These few days, when I eat KFC, I can\u2019t even afford the family bucket. I can only get a drumstick. I can\u2019t even have milk tea,\u201d Han Xiao sighed. He was filled with complaints.</p><br/><p>Imperial was not a forest. To raise a tiger was indeed difficult, especially for someone like Han Xiao, who could barely even feed himself. Forget about feeding the tiger well.</p><br/><p>She realized that even though the Master was amazing, his capabilities of maintaining a livelihood and taking care of himself was practically negative. She really did not know how he had stayed alive until now.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi said, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me take care of it for a few days!\u201d Han Xiao said with no trace of courtesy.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless and did not want to say anything at this point.</p><br/><p>The first time, he made her settle his bills. The second time, he just let her be his financial support, and it was to financially support a tiger with a huge appetite!</p><br/><p>Thankfully, this request was exactly what Ning Xi wanted!</p><br/><p>Oh! Her cute tiger!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. Just send it over! I\u2019m in that little town I was in the last time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not too long after she hung up, Han Xiao sent the tiger to Deer Town.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Deer Town was remote and was considered an undeveloped area, plus it was already night time. Otherwise, the appearance of this tiger would surely cause panic.</p><br/><p>When she saw the white tiger beside Han Xiao, Ning Xi\u2019s eyes immediately shone. \u201cMaster, what does it usually eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust feed it whatever!\u201d Han Xiao yawned lazily, then he just waved and left.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched. She sighed and stroked the white tiger\u2019s head. \u201cYour master is too unreliable. Next time, you should just roll with me! I guarantee I\u2019ll feed you well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speaking with the tiger when suddenly, there was a soft bump on her leg. A delicate little rice ball had run up to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Baby Little Treasure! I miss you so much! Quickly let Mommy kiss and hug you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure stuck to Ning Xi\u2019s embrace and was delighted. At this moment, when he saw the white tiger beside Ning Xi from the corner of his eye, his eyes widened. \u201cMommy! Careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the little guy quickly squeezed his way in between Ning Xi and the white tiger, making a blocking gesture. He glared at the tiger opposite him like a little tiger cub himself.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was so moved that she rubbed the little guy\u2019s head. \u201cLittle Treasure, don\u2019t worry. This is Mommy\u2019s friend, he won\u2019t hurt people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard Ning Xi say that, Little Treasure was relieved.</p><br/><p>After he was no longer vigilant, he started to observe the huge white tiger curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside and play. Don\u2019t frighten the neighbors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, Ning Xi led the little bun and the white tiger into the house.</p><br/><p>When Lu Tingxiao heard the sound of the front door, he knew that Ning Xi had returned. He subconsciously looked over at the entrance.</p><br/><p>When he saw the familiar white tiger by Ning Xi\u2019s side, Lu Tingxiao was slightly taken aback. \u201cHan Xiao came by?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged. \u201cNo, that guy said that he can\u2019t afford to raise it. He\u2019s asking me to help him take care of it for a few days! This master is unreliable!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Any male artiste in China would surely experience a spike in both popularity and fame if they landed the role.</p><br/><p>Jace had just given her such an important decision to make.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a cross-dressing assassin, I think the appearance and aura are very important since it involves actual cross-dressing scenes. Moreover, I\u2019d say we need an extremely popular artiste to align with the current movies trend within the country. There is actually one suitable candidate among the artistes I know,\u201d Ning Xi said gingerly after giving it some careful thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Jace took out a contract and handed it over to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the contract. There are some details and the remuneration is inside. Go ahead,\u201d said Jace.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was shocked when she took the contract.</p><br/><p>He\u2026 he had just given it to her like this?</p><br/><p>Just with a few of her words?</p><br/><p>Was he not being too trustful towards her?</p><br/><p>Being cautious, Ning Xi tried to decline, but Jace trusted her and asked her for help. Ning Xi could not say no anymore, so she just took the contract.</p><br/><p>She was pretty confident about the person she was about to recommend anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After she left the club, Ning Xi drove to a certain villa straight away. She knocked on Jiang Muye\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was wearing his pajamas. With his slippers on, he gripped a game controller in his hands. He was taken aback when he saw Ning Xi outside his door. Clearly, he did not expect her.</p><br/><p>When he realized it, he said, \u201cYo, Aunty, what brings you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was still angry at her for putting her romance before him!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi poked her head inside and asked discreetly, \u201cIs there\u2026 anyone inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew you!\u201d Jiang Muye glared at her when he realized the intention behind that question.</p><br/><p>Did he look like such a ridiculous person?</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you have a lot of dates lately? I\u2019m worried that I might bother your path to happiness!\u201d Ning Xi went in after knowing that there were no girls in his house.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye closed the door and sprinted back to the sofa, continuing to play his game.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop playing. I have some important matters to discuss with you,\u201d Ning Xi said as soon as she saw Jiang Muye started playing his game.</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, I\u2019ve been playing for the whole night. It\u2019s getting to the good part!\u201d Jiang Muye was really focused.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou forced me to do this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went up to him and without considering Jiang Muye, she pulled the electrical socket of the game console.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye leaped up in fury. \u201cNing Xiao Xi! Even if you give me a girl right now, I wouldn\u2019t forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi snarled in annoyance. \u201cYou wish! But I do have something good for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething good? It\u2019d be good if you stopped messing with me!\u201d Jiang Muye was irritated too.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really have something important to talk to you about. I want you to take up a role.\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s expression turned serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cRole\u2026 What role?\u201d Jiang Muye became sober as well while he looked at Ning Xi with doubt.</p><br/><p>What kind of role would make Ning Xi come and see him personally?</p><br/><p>Did he look like he was lacking work?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

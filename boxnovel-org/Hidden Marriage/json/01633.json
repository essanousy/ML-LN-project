I'll remind you when the time comes!\" Although Feng Xiaoxiao said that, she just wanted to hide the fact that she wanted to eavesdrop on some juicy stuff.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not overthink. She also wanted to let them know how troublesome this guy was and that she had tried her best.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went back to the seat without hanging up the call.</p><br/><p>\"Before I answer you, can you answer something first? Why're you staying inside?\" Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>The man put on a sarcastic smile. \"To let you see how your white knight is really like when he carries out his duties.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi frowned.</p><br/><p>So, did he mean that this was Lu Tingxiao's doing?</p><br/><p>\"Before we decide on who did this, even if someone from Lu Tingxiao's side is involved, you guys are against each other now, and you've been causing a lot of problems for the Lu Corporation, haven't you?\" Ning Xi interrogated.</p><br/><p>The man's expression did not change at all. He conversed self-righteously, \"So what? I'm not a good person, but I've never hidden that from you before.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was shocked.</p><br/><p>What was with this nonsense?</p><br/><p>She still could not communicate with him after all\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ning Xi thought of Annie's worrying face, and she forced herself to continue, \"All of us are worried about you. If it's about this, there's no need to. Fine, I get it now, I know what he's doing. Is that what you want?\"</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao was really anxious on the line. \"Little Junior Sister, you can't say that! He's just making excuses up now. Follow the answer I told you just now. Nothing else will work\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hesitated again. How could she really say that?</p><br/><p>\"You've used up all your chances.\" The man then turned around and left.</p><br/><p>\"Hey... You\u2026\" In her attempt to stop him, she probably got up too quickly and blacked out for a few seconds. She felt dizzy as she tried to stabilize her body, but soon she lost consciousness\u2026</p><br/><p>Thud\u2014</p><br/><p>There was an odd sound.</p><br/><p>The man stopped and turned around to see the girl fell on the ground unexpectedly.</p><br/><p>\"Ning Xi!\" The man rushed towards her, his lazy tone suddenly turning fearful. \"Damn it! Don't try anything funny!\"</p><br/><p>The girl lay on the floor and did not move, her face oddly pale. She was frowning and her breathing was pretty quick and shallow.</p><br/><p>\"What happened?\" Tang Ye asked.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the man's expression looked terrible. He roared at the small window connecting through the glass.</p><br/><p>\"Tang Ye! Get me out of here right now!\"</p><br/><p>Tang Ye and Feng Xiaoxiao were dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Ye went in with a lawyer.</p><br/><p>In just five minutes, they got him out and he was politely invited to leave.</p><br/><p>\"Where's she?\" The man demanded coldly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had been moved outside by the police staff after she passed out.</p><br/><p>\"In the car,\" Tang Ye replied.</p><br/><p>\"She's in the car already. Don't worry, Annie's here!\" Feng Xiaoxiao told him.</p><br/><p>The man, who seemed like he was about to stay in the police station forever, was now walking swiftly outside\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

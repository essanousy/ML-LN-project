When she reached the last one, she stared blankly at it for a moment.</p><br/><p>[My dear, I\u2019ve really underestimated your guts.]</p><br/><p>Sender: YS</p><br/><p>Why did this guy send her a message like that out of the blue? What had she done?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had deleted the call log, so Ning Xi naturally didn\u2019t know that the two men had talked to each other that night.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked upon realising that her expression didn\u2019t seem right.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d She just took it for a fit of madness from that person and just ignored it. Ning Xi put down her phone and asked, \u201cWhen is Little Treasure coming over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be reaching soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she heard that, Ning Xi subconsciously touched her hair, \u201cWhere\u2019s the hair clip that Little Treasure gave to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here, I helped you put it away previously.\u201d Lu Tingxiao pulled the bedside drawer open and handed the pink hair clip over to her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi happily put it on.</p><br/><p>Looking at the hair clip on Ning Xi\u2019s head, a trace of regret flitted across Lu Tingxiao\u2019s heart. If he had known earlier, he wouldn\u2019t have given her a gun. If he had given her a necklace, bracelet or earrings, she might have been able to wear it on her all the time.</p><br/><p>Actually, he had already prepared a gift early on: a ring. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t the right time to give it to her.</p><br/><p>While the two of them were conversing, a knock sounded at the door.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi slipped out from the bed and went to open the door. As expected, Little Treasure had arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Little Treasure entered the ward, the first thing he did was to pull at her clothes urgently with his little paws, seemingly asking for her to bend lower.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Ning Xi squatted down.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure immediately knocked his forehead against hers with a completely serious expression.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi couldn\u2019t resist laughing out loud, \u201cHeh, Darling, are you checking my temperature? Relax, I just used the thermometer to take my temperature, the fever\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure still had a worried expression on his face. He stared with an expression of heartache at the bruise left on the back of her hand from the IV drip.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wrapped the little guy up in her embrace and comforted him with pats, \u201cDon\u2019t frown anymore, all of Auntie\u2019s pain flew away the moment Auntie saw you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun was practically a miracle cure. She really wanted to steal him away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to go downstairs for a walk?\u201d Lu Tingxiao suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes!\u201d She felt like moving her body a little after sleeping the whole day. It wasn\u2019t good to trap Little Treasure in the ward with her either.</p><br/><p>The three of them passed by another ward on the way to the elevator. There were a bunch of reporters wielding cameras crowding outside the ward, raising a huge clamour and fighting to interview the woman inside the ward:</p><br/><p>\u201cXueluo, have you managed to contact Ning Xi yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet, there\u2019s been no news of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi is trying to abscond from fear of her arrest. Is there anything you\u2019d like to say about this? What do you intend to do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 I still don\u2019t believe that she would do something like that even now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard that Ning Corporation and Starlight Entertainment have both withdrawn their sponsorship to express their objections? Has there been any reply from the production team? Are they going to replace Ning Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that, you can ask the representative of the production team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Ning Xi reappears and apologises to you, will you forgive her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s heartfelt about her regret, I can personally forgive her mistake. However, the negative impact she has made on the entertainment circle isn\u2019t something that can be resolved by a simple apology, and it\u2019s not up to me to forgive that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi unexpectedly bumped into a scene where Ning Xueluo was playing her part as an innocent flower to the fullest. She couldn\u2019t help but frown. It was only now that she realised she was staying in the same hospital as Ning Xueluo, and they were even on the same floor.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that one of the reporters noticed Ning Xi standing near the elevator right in front of the ward. He abruptly shouted in surprise, \u201cNing Xi\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a bit rusty, I\u2019ve practiced for many years!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to start a restaurant?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao asked puzzled.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s smile is slightly bleak, \u201cYou can\u2019t laugh at me. I don\u2019t want to be a cook, I wanted to be that person\u2019s wife\u201d.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly making it difficult to detect the chill.</p><br/><p>\u2018Want to be that person\u2019s wife\u2019,such moving words but that \u2018person\u2019 is not him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a silly and naive thought that if you seize a man through his stomach, you can catch his heart. Little did I know\u2026\u2026\u201d, Ning Xi suddenly stopped. She glanced at Little Treasure, saw that he was focused on staring at the soup pot. She then leaned towards Lu Ting Xiao and continued speaking in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut as everyone knows that three inches below the belly button is where the man\u2019s real heart is (the thing below the belt). I did so much preparing to make his meals (preparing to be a wife) but he\u2019d rather have Ning Xuelo accompany him to bed (to do you know what). Isn\u2019t that very sad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSadly, he will regret it\u201d, Lu Ting Xiao truthfully said in a comforting tone.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi admitted that he had really comforted her and laughed lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I had so much fun today so no need to mention those disappointing things. Here, this soup is finished and we should put some fried vegetables on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao glanced at the basket, \u201cWe didn\u2019t buy any vegetables.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy any?\u201d Ning Xi replied dumbfounded. \u201cNo cauliflower? No radishes? I can\u2019t afford not to have any? Eating like this will make you dead tired. I want some eggplant to fry and, ah\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>They currently have eight meat dishes, and just two vegetable dishes; a mix of sugar lotus root and a sliced tomato salad\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to Jingli\u2019s garden to pick some?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! He has that kind of thing?\u201d, Ning Xi asked surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he has a vegetable greenhouse in his yard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! But I\u2019ll go since you won\u2019t know what to pick!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll look after the soup then. Take Little Treasure with you, otherwise the guard won\u2019t know who you are.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao told her</p><br/><p>\u201cNo worries, we are going through the back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Because there are small bushes, Ning Xi carried the little bun and walked quietly into Lu Jingli\u2019s backyard to the vegetables location.</p><br/><p>Amazingly, the vegetables look good. The eggplant looks really juicy and fresher than those at the supermarket. Of course, it is also because they are freshly picked.</p><br/><p>That guy Lu Jingli, just hiding here eating good things \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Leaving the basket with Little Treasure, they suddenly heard a sharp warning sound</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her head and looked around, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind them came a loud shout \u2013 \u201cThief!!! Which little thief dares to steal my food? Eh? It is Little Treasure\u2026and.. Ning Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli came out wearing pajamas and wrapped in a blanket saw the two: one small and one big looking dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi picked up the vegetable basket, her mouth twitching,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of person has a vegetable garden with burglar alarms installed\u2026how much you value it is interesting. Is there gold buried underneath?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

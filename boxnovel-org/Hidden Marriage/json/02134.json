It\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Tang Lang seemed very cheerful when he saw Baron\u2019s stunned face.</p><br/><p>Baron stared at Han Xiao, his expression souring ,and he did not say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s really rare for you to come out. It saves me time to look for you guys in Europe.\u201d Han Xiao stood up and yawned, not seeming motivated.</p><br/><p>Baron grinned, then he flashed a cold smile with the intention to ridicule. \u201cHaha, I didn\u2019t expect that Grandfather Xiao has fallen to the state whereby you\u2019re being ordered around by two little fish. The Grandfather Xiao back then was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Baron looked at Han Xiao as he continued talking, but he was frustrated by Han Xiao\u2019s behavior. Han Xiao was not listening at all, and was discussing something with the bunch.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think his father will come out if I tie him up?\u201d Han Xiao looked at Tang Lang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, that might not happen!\u201d Tang Lang touched his chin sagely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe European King has so many children. I think it might not work too,\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Tang Ye nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s worthless\u2026 Then, should I kill him or tie him up?\u201d Han Xiao looked troubled.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wanted to join the group as well. She poked her head in and suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we tie him up first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang then said, \u201cGrandfather, I think let\u2019s kill him. Let him know how amazing you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao was on Ning Xi\u2019s side. \u201cI agree with Little Junior Sister. Let\u2019s tie him up and force the European King to show up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with either choice,\u201d said Tang Ye.</p><br/><p>Baron was infuriated.</p><br/><p>These people were discussing if they should kill him or tie him up right in front of him!</p><br/><p>Who was he? He was the future European King!</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Xiao, don\u2019t get too full of yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Baron\u2019s words, several hundred well-trained and fully-equipped forces surrounded the resort. Looking around, there were also a lot of snipers camping out!</p><br/><p>All of them looked cautious when they noticed the presence of the snipers.</p><br/><p>These were not ordinary snipers. They were snipers who had undergone special training from the Rothschild clan. Aside from Han Xiao, everyone else could possibly die here.</p><br/><p>Tang Ye, Tang Lang, and Feng Xiaoxiao were on guard. A familiar voice came from behind and their expressions changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Master, everything is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Yi led a group of trained assassins and was walking towards them. These assassins were all the elites he had. Today was all he had been waiting for.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked behind Qiao Yi and did not see Annie, so she frowned.</p><br/><p>Was Annie not here?</p><br/><p>Or did she not want to face them directly?</p><br/><p>The atmosphere turned extremely heavy all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Baron was determined to acquire both the Lu Corporation and the Yi Lan Innovative Investment Group, so he would do anything to achieve his goal.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong time no see, Master!\u201d Tang Lang\u2019s blood started boiling when he saw Qiao Yi. His features darkened as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou traitor!\u201d Qiao Yi yelled in rage when he saw Tang Lang.</p><br/><p>The usual sloppy attitude was nowhere to be seen in Tang Lang. \u201cWhat a coincidence! We\u2019ll settle all our grudges here today! I told you in the hospital last time that I\u2019d never go easy on you the next time!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Feng Xiaoxiao had a little bit too much to drink and she brought a big bunch of friends to have some fun in the bridal room.</p><br/><p>As the groom Lu Tingxiao arrived at the door, a group of girls led by Feng Xiaoxiao gathered there and blocked the path.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao crossed her arms and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, CEO Lu. On behalf of the Little Junior Sister\u2019s family, if you want to enter this room, you have to pass our trial!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Xinyan went along. \u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s not going to be so easy to take our Bro Xi away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Annie said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Annie, why are you messing around with Feng Xiaoxiao!?\u201d Tang Lang was speechless.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was speechless as well. \u201cXinyan, shouldn\u2019t you be on our side?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Xinyan stuck her tongue out. \u201cI\u2019m always on Ning Xi\u2019s side!\u201d</p><br/><p>On Feng Xiaoxiao\u2019s side, there were eight girls including Zhuang Keer, Ning Tianxin, Annie, and Lu Xinyan. All of them were hardcore fans of Ning Xi, and some even thought of Lu Tingxiao as their rival. On Lu Jingli\u2019s side, there were Lu Jingli, Jiang Muye, Tang Lang, Mo Lingtian, and Qin Mufeng.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the trial?\u201d Lu Tingxiao smiled, probably because it was a happy day, so he did not seem to mind them messing around and just let them be.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao then said, \u201cThere will be three levels in total! You need to pass all three levels to get the girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the first level?\u201d Lu Jingli asked cautiously.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao had an evil grin. \u201cThe first level is called \u2018Take A Guess\u2019. We\u2019ll give you three questions. You\u2019ll pass if you get all correct. The first question is what am I thinking about right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang then complained, \u201cYou\u2019re really too much! Do you know how important it is of a day like this to a man? I can\u2019t continue this anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli frowned. \u201cHow are we suppose to guess? You can just deny anything we say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye and Qin Mufeng nodded in agreement. \u201cThis question is bugged!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as she doesn\u2019t say that our answer is correct, then we\u2019ll never pass!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them looked over at Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao acted cheekily. \u201cWhat now? Are you guys giving up on the first question already? If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll have fun with Little Junior Sister tonight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about men!\u201d Tang Lang tried.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao wagged her finger. \u201cWrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about marrying someone?\u201d Lu Jingli tried as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Give it a try, Qin Mufeng! Aren\u2019t you a psychiatrist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I\u2019m a psychiatrist? Even if I can read her mind, she can just deny whatever I say!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do? The first question is already so tricky\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the quiet Lu Tingxiao spoke up, \u201cYou\u2019re now thinking that you don\u2019t want to let us in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao was smiling. Just as she was about to call his mistake out, she was stunned when she realized what was Lu Tingxiao saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO Lu! You\u2019re trying to trap me!\u201d</p><br/><p>If she said that it was wrong, then it would mean that she wanted to let them go in! They could just skip the rest of the levels and she would then have to let them in.</p><br/><p>If she said that it was right, then they would pass this question\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli laughed. \u201cAs expected of my brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao clenched her teeth. \u201cFine, you\u2019re right!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

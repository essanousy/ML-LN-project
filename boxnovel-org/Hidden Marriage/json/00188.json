I\u2019m aiming for probably 2 chapters a day depending on my schedule. Having someone do the editing for me will help me release a lot faster, so if you\u2019re interested drop me a line \ud83d\ude00</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Glitter like sequins explode and surround Lu Ting Xiao like a mushroom cloud. A moment later, Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s head and clothes are covered with them.</p><br/><p>Staring closely will show that what blasted out and is littered over him are a lot of shiny things. On closer look, they seem to be diamonds\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This familiar way of sending things, there\u2019s no need to even ask who it is.</p><br/><p>This is just too wicked.</p><br/><p>Others spend money to hit people, what\u2019s it for him to use diamonds to hit people. (Must be nice, I want to be on that level XD)</p><br/><p>Although the number of carats aren\u2019t large, but having so many together, someone can be make it into a ring. This would cause hundreds of thousands of men to come and propose.</p><br/><p>Not only is Lu Ting Xiao covered in them, in the back seat Ning Xi and Little Treasure have also been affected and are covered with the sparkling crystal.</p><br/><p>Ning XI: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure:\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi Wiped her face, then helped Little Treasure wipe his face too. She then quickly leaned over to help Lu Ting Xiao pick off the things messily stuck to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026 are you okay? Did they get in your eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Xiao Ting shook his head, shaking off a layer of diamond pieces, and a small piece of paper.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi opened it and read: My dear, Happy Birthday, are you satisfied with what you see? \u2013 YS</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Lu Ting Xiao gave her a slightly complex look. \u201cDo you like it this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>He began to-self reflect. Compared to other people, wouldn\u2019t his expression be considered rude?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked speechless. \u201cDo I look like I like it? I can say that I\u2019m surprised, but how can I be happy at this rain full of horror? Lu Ting Xiao, although you are rich, don\u2019t act like this when chasing a girl! If you need help, I can teach you the type of presents to send!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lu Ting Xiao heard this, his mouth hooked into a smile. Of course, this is what he wished for. \u201cWell\u201d he starts</p><br/><p>At this time, he caught a glimpse of a car that followed them this whole time in the rearview mirror. It seems to be Ning Yaohua\u2019s car.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi seeing that Lu Ting Xiao looked right, followed his line of sight and also found the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! This guy is not finished yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need me to throw them off?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao asks</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thought about it, then shook her head. \u201cForget about it, they can\u2019t get us anyways. Besides Little Treasure is still in the car, driving fast is too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later, at the Platinum Palace</p><br/><p>Extremely incompatible from Lu Ting Xiao and from her motor bike, a luxury black car slowly drove to the front gate.</p><br/><p>They were a few meters away when the guard respectfully saluted, then graciously opened the gate allowing them to drive through. Before long, the car cannot be seen.</p><br/><p>Then, trying to follow into the gate opening, Ning Yaohua was immediately stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, please show me pass\u201d the guard asks with a business-like expression.</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua anxiously looking at the car turning the corner impatiently replies, \u201cWhat pass?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a pass?\u201d The guard asked. \u201cThen which resident should I call to give you entry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua frowned, \u201cWhy can that car just easily go in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is one of the residents\u201d The guard replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Ning Yaohua\u2019s face instantly changed. How is this not wrong? This is the platinum palace! The gathering place of the Empire\u2019s richest! There\u2019s no market! How could that bitch with a broken car live here? Is it\u2026\u2026 Is he a butler or special assistant, or someone\u2019s illegitimate child?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

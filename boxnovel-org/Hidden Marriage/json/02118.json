She quickly went over to Little Treasure and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Little Treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The fever\u2019s gone already,\u201d Lu Tingxiao said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes darkened. While he seemed to be thinking about something, he comforted Ning Xi with a relaxed expression, \u201cYou\u2019re being too anxious about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded. \u201cI guess so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt too pressured with so much to consider about.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure did not seem to be very energetic even after his fever went down. Thankfully, the fever did not come back and things were fine for two days.</p><br/><p>However, Little Treasure\u2019s condition unexpectedly worsened on the third day.</p><br/><p>While he did not have a temperature, he fell unconscious and his body was really weak.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao quickly sent him to the Imperial Military Hospital that night.</p><br/><p>The results of the second full body checkup still showed no sign of illness.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s hand trembled when she took out her phone as she looked at Little Treasure hooked up to a ventilator. \u201cLet me ask Annie to take a look at him!\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought it was just a normal fever and did not expect things to turn out this way.</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi was about to make a call by the door, there was a voice behind her. \u201cThe brat is sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Shen\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was surprised to see who it was.</p><br/><p>The man looked as arrogant as usual. He had a black shirt on; the contrast made his fine skin appear even whiter than usual.</p><br/><p>When he saw Ning Xi\u2019s surprised expression, the man raised up his right middle finger which was bandaged. \u201cI got injured by a needle. Annie wasn\u2019t around and Ye forced me to come to the hospital!\u201d</p><br/><p>He sounded aggrieved.</p><br/><p>Not just Tang Ye and Feng Xiaoxiao, even Tang Lang was there as well. Ever since Yun Shen and Lu Tingxiao ceased their war, Tang Lang had been hanging out with Tang Ye.</p><br/><p>Tang Ye had his usual stoic glasses on.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao and Tang Lang crossed their arms and just stood there, their mouths twitching.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the fact that he was suddenly injured by a mere needle, why did he sounded so aggrieved?He had a medical condition whereby he would profusely bleed if he was injured!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? Little Treasure is sick?\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao took a peek into the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Hasn\u2019t Little Treasure\u2019s fever come down yet?\u201d Tang Lang asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not look well as she shook her head. \u201cAt first, the fever didn\u2019t go down. It finally went away two days ago, but now he\u2019s suddenly fallen unconscious. The body checkups showed nothing odd. I was about to call Annie over to take a look at Little Treasure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen glanced over at the little bun. He narrowed his eyes and mumbled, \u201cThis condition\u2026 seems familiar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ning Xi suddenly became nervous. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it before? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to take a look at the brat to confirm,\u201d Yun Shen said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi frowned, apparently not very trusting of this guy. She never heard of him knowing about illnesses.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like Sister-in-law doesn\u2019t trust me? Fine then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lu Tingxiao said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Let him take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi then nodded with ease. \u201cOh, go ahead then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shen was speechless. He suddenly did not feel like helping anymore!</p></div>\n</div>"}

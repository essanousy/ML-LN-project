Or maybe, there was no need for him to explain.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure understood all of this deep down too. He was just angry, bitter, and felt wronged. Why could he not have been Aunty Xiao Xi\u2019s biological child?</p><br/><p>Inside the study room, the atmosphere between the father and son had suddenly come to a stand still.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s phone rang. It was Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\"Hello?\"</p><br/><p>\"Big Boss, do you miss me?\" The girl\u2019s cheerful voice came from the other end of the phone. Simply from her tone, it must have gone well on her end.</p><br/><p>\"I do.\" He had never missed her more than this very moment.</p><br/><p>My wife, if you do not come home soon, I cannot deal with the son anymore.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, I\u2019m about to get on my flight. I\u2019ll reach Imperial tonight but it'll be quite late when I do, so I won\u2019t disturb your sleep. I\u2019ll go look for you and Little Treasure tomorrow morning.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll pick you up.\"</p><br/><p>\"Uhh, I\u2019ll be with Momo and Director Qiao. Do you really want to frighten them both? I\u2019ll just get a cab back! Good boy! Oh, is Little Treasure asleep? If he isn\u2019t, can I say a few words to him?\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lu Tingxiao passed the phone over to his son who had been waiting impatiently beside him.</p><br/><p>\"Mommy!\" When the little bun heard Ning Xi\u2019s voice, his expression turned much more obedient as if he was a different person from the angry Little Treasure earlier.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, late at night, in a certain underground casino, Zhuang Rongguang\u2019s eyes stared at the cards in his hand and his palms started to sweat while everyone around him watched with fixed gazes.</p><br/><p>Finally, the last card was revealed bit by bit, and the instant it was revealed, Zhuang Rongguang\u2019s nasty friends had already emotionally jumped up from their seats and Zhuang Rongguang swiftly tossed the cards in his hands as he declared, \"Straight flush! Give me my money!\"</p><br/><p>A stack of chips were pushed over and Zhuang Rongguang looked very happy. He had already planned to travel the world after graduating, but his family would definitely not agree and had even execute an economic sanction on him. His sister was also very firm on this; she was definitely on the family\u2019s side and refused to give him a single cent.</p><br/><p>Recently, he had been thinking about ways to crowdfund, so when his friends heard about his situation, they suggested for him to try his luck here. Even though he was playful, he knew that he should not be involved with certain things like gambling, but this time, he was really in dire need for cash and when he saw that quite a few of his buddies had won quite a bit, he decided to give it a go.</p><br/><p>At first, he did not dare to risk too much, but Lady Luck was on his side today and he had gathered quite a few million in chips in no time.</p><br/><p>Up next, Zhuang Rongguang played for another three rounds and had won all of them. Initially, he felt that he had collected enough money and was ready to leave, but since he felt so lucky, he could not bear to go and decided to continue playing, fueled by his friends\u2019 persuasion...</p><br/><p>Not too far away in a corner, a square-faced man with blonde hair and bare arms revealed a vulgar smile. He picked up his phone and made a call, \"The big fish is hooked, reel in the net!\"</p><br/><p>Not too long after the blonde-haired man hung up, a tall man wearing a thick gold chain had squeezed through the crowd without batting an eyelid and walked right up to Zhuang Rongguang. \"Hey! Little brother! I\u2019ve watched you for half a day and they all say you\u2019re in luck today but I don\u2019t quite believe them. Dare to play a round of huge stakes with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Bring it on, I\u2019m not afraid of you!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

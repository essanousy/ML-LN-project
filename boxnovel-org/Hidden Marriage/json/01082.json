Didn\u2019t the main branch assign some professional salespeople to you?\" Ning Xi glanced at the sales guides and the manager.</p><br/><p>\"I hired them! It\u2019s my own shop, so of course, I\u2019m going to recruit the people myself. Only then will it be counted as my own effort!\" Lu Xinyan looked proudly at Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi almost passed out hearing the girl\u2019s logic. She took a deep breath. \"Change them! All of them! I\u2019ll pick out personnel from the main branch for you. Just follow the protocol!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s tone was ferocious and she did not give any chance for Lu Xinyan to say anything.</p><br/><p>\"Fine, fine...you\u2019re the boss. I\u2019ll do whatever you say...but what happened?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Xinyan frowned a little, she could sort of guess what had happened. Ning Xi must have noticed some issues when she arrived in the store. Otherwise, she would not be this angry.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Lu Xinyan felt immensely guilty. Although her financial report seemed to be earning a lot on the surface, she was losing money. A lot of money\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Big boss?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Boss from the main branch?!\"</p><br/><p>The few sales guides could not believe it. This woman was the founder of Spirit?! They freaked out, never imagining that the boss would suddenly appear in the store.</p><br/><p>The store manager had only felt like she had seen Ning Xi before, but she had not known that Ning Xi was the founder of Spirit.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s voice softened as Lu Xinyan\u2019s attitude was gentle and she had toned down. \"Also, cancel all your promotions. Go and look for Director Qiao tomorrow. Learn how to run a franchise from her!\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Cancel? I came up with these campaigns with all my wits!\" Lu Xinyan sounded dejected.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched. \"My dear, you used up all your wits just to lose money like this?!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Xinyan\u2019s expression froze. \"Y-you found out\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Oh, no! Her cover was blown!</p><br/><p>\"In three days, I want to see you strictly following the plan and our protocol! If not, you\u2019ll bear the consequences!\" Ning Xi left the store without even looking back at the workers.</p><br/><p>They were all shocked when they saw Ning Xi\u2019s attitude towards Lu Xinyan.</p><br/><p>Lu Xinyan was Lu Tingxiao\u2019s cousin! Yet, Ning Xi had yelled at her!</p><br/><p>Who exactly was this woman?</p><br/><p>\"What happened?!\" Lu Xinyan asked angrily while glaring at her people after Ning Xi left.</p><br/><p>\"Boss...I-I don\u2019t know anything! Big boss was already angry when I came back. It must be them!\" The store manager pushed the responsibility away completely.</p><br/><p>One of the salesgirls told the truth.</p><br/><p>After she heard everything, Lu Xinyan immediately fired everyone, including the manager.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

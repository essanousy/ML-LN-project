Do you know how much the penalty for breaking a contract is? There are still four years left in the contract you have with the company. The penalty is 2 million yuan for every year, coming to a total of 8 million yuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shot a look at the lawyer waiting to one side.</p><br/><p>The expressionless lawyer pulled out a black briefcase and flipped it open\u2026 whoosh! It was filled with money; cold hard cash!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pushed the briefcase to Chang Li, \u201cHere\u2019s 8 million yuan. Do you want to count it all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chang Li stared, flabbergasted, at the pile of cash before her, \u201cWhere did you get so much money from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spoke with impatience, \u201cThat has nothing to do with you, does it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, didn\u2019t you just get it from sleeping around? What are you acting all arrogant for? Did you think just 8 million was enough?!\u201d Chang Li tossed a thick document at her: an agreement for terminating her contract. It seemed like she had already been prepared.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took the agreement and skimmed through the pages. As she continued reading, she became more and more amused, \u201cChang-jie, why didn\u2019t I ever realise I was worth so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>The penalty they were asking for was 60 million dollars!</p><br/><p>She knew that it wouldn\u2019t be easy to terminate her contract, they would definitely come up with some way to make things difficult for her.</p><br/><p>Chang Li recovered her unperturbed expression, \u201cThis is the estimate that our specialised lawyer came up with. It\u2019s stated clearly in the agreement that you have to pay for damages to the company in addition to the 8 million yuan penalty for terminating the contract!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe damages include the postponement of our activities, the discontinuation of our investment, and the grievous injuries suffered by our most valuable actress\u2026 After calculating everything, this is already the bare minimum you have to cough up! If you can\u2019t pay up, then we\u2019ll meet in the courts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s brows knitted together after hearing this. She didn\u2019t know how good Lawyer Chen was, and whether he would be able to settle everything\u2026</p><br/><p>Lawyer Chen simply glanced at the agreement. After that, his expression remained cold and respectful as before, without any visible changes in emotion.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ning Xi was hesitating, Chang Li immediately softened her tone,\u201d Ning Xi, think carefully. Do you really want to terminate your contract? Actually, it\u2019s not like we can\u2019t discuss about this. If you\u2019re not willing to take on \u300aBlooming Like It\u2019s Spring\u300b, we can make other arrangements. I have a few screenplays on hand and they\u2019re all big projects. I\u2019ll let you pick from them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sneered inwardly. What big projects? They were likely the same kind of setup for her, just under different names!</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was clearly desperate to make her stay at Starlight so that she could keep her under her thumb and keep her in shackles for the rest of her life. However, she was also afraid that Ning Xi would give up and return to the Ning family if she was pressured too much\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, the sound of knocking came from the door. Starlight\u2019s lawyers had arrived, and there were even three of them all at once.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi even recognised one of them: one of the top lawyers at Ning Corporation, Cai Yingyong.</p><br/><p>Damn! Ning Xueluo was really putting her all into making things difficult for her!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the lonely Lawyer Chen on her side and uncertainty rose in her heart.</p><br/><p>Now that Chang Li had gotten her backup, she crossed her arms over her chest and looked haughty, \u201cNing Xi, it\u2019s not too late for you to change your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were specialised ways to counteract these legal measures, but Ning Xi really had no idea about legal matters at all. She could only look towards Lawyer Chen with hope.</p><br/><p>Lawyer Chen\u2026 remained silent.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was about to go crazy from desperation. Weren\u2019t all lawyers supposed to be really eloquent? On top of being so stiff, why did this guy have to act like he was mute? Was it going to be okay or not?!</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>The events that followed made Ning Xi feel like she was watching a drama.</p><br/><p>Lawyer Chen slowly stood up and took out a stack of documents from his briefcase. He finally spoke up: \u201cFirstly, as far as I know, your company discontinued your investment in order to threaten the production team, it has nothing to do with my client.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecondly, Ning Corporation has no relation with my client, so their losses shouldn\u2019t be borne by my client.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirdly, your company\u2019s employee suffered injury on set, so this should be borne by your company, the production team and the insurance company. Since my client hasn\u2019t been deemed guilty by any court, my client has no responsibility to bear those costs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, from the medical report of your company\u2019s actress, Miss Ning Xueluo, she only suffered mild superficial wounds. At most, we will compensate her with 252.40 yuan. As for the other expenses such as the stay in the high-class ward and maintenance fees, those shouldn\u2019t be borne by my client\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While facing three other lawyers by himself, Lawyer Chen fired off his rebuttals in quick-fire succession. He spoke for half an hour without getting short of breath, leaving the three lawyers on the other side speechless as they sweated profusely. He successfully helped her to terminated her contract, and except for that 8 million yuan, they didn\u2019t spend a single cent more\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh, wait, they spent an extra 252.40 yuan\u2026</p><br/><p>TL Note:</p><br/><p>You know how much 8 million yuan is in USD by now!! \ud83d\ude1b</p><br/><p>252.40 yuan is USD 36.56 exactly~ Whew~</p><br/><p>On a side note, please read this announcement about the future of HM: http://volarenovels.com/announcement-eewc-hm/</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She was donning \u2014</p><br/><p>One of the key highlight pieces of Spirit, \u201cLuoshen\u201d!</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was still a straight guy after all. His expression changed when he saw Ning Xi in her usual female outfit. In his flush of hormones, his ears were a little red and his eyes looked at her differently.</p><br/><p>Still, this prideful guy was still trying to hide it, so he mumbled quietly, \u201cThat\u2019s no fun at all! She\u2019s just using a fully upgraded weapon to slay a novice village!\u201d</p><br/><p>Exhibiting true strength was always the best way to shut people up.</p><br/><p>All the dissatisfied voices disappeared after Ning Xi appeared. The majority of the supporters flushed out the tiny amount of criticisms.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! My goddess is so beautiful! What should I do? I\u2019m not sure if I like guys or girls anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know what brand is my goddess wearing? I\u2019ve never seen it before! It looks so much better than Han Zixuan\u2019s outfit! While what she wore looks good, but she gives a vibe of being a newly rich person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know! It\u2019s Spirit! Goddess has always been a loyal fan of Spirit! Don\u2019t you know? She wore Spirit\u2019s key highlight piece, \u2018Beings\u2019 at Glory World Entertainment\u2019s anniversary. At the Golden Film Awards she wore the renowned work of Spirit\u2019s lead designer, \u2018Nirvana Reincarnated\u2019, and now this is the second key highlight piece of Spirit, \u2018Luoshen\u2019. It\u2019s a collaboration between Spirit\u2019s lead designer and Master Song Qin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso! The white <em>qipao </em>Bro Xi wore when she just reappeared is a new series called \u2018Back To The Origins\u2019 from Spirit. I\u2019ve never seen the one she wore in the beginning before. I guess it\u2019s a new series that\u2019s not been announced yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see! It\u2019s Spirit! It was quite popular back then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of their recent releases look really impressive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Several fans brought up the Spirit outfits Ning Xi wore in the past, and suddenly Spirit was back in the public eye again. It was free promotion and a stellar marketing strategy.</p><br/><p>Finally, the Night of Starlight finally ended.</p><br/><p>Starlight lost all their chances to turn the tables.</p><br/><p>At midnight, in a hospital.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo already received the news from the company and she flopped on the sofa, irritated. \u201cWhat a useless bunch!\u201d</p><br/><p>They had invested so many resources and could not even win over an outdated artiste, losing to Glory World that had nearly closed down.</p><br/><p>However, she had no time to solve Starlight\u2019s issue now. She had much more important things to do.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo looked at her phone impatiently while waiting for the doctor\u2019s diagnosis.</p><br/><p>After a while, a female doctor around fifty years old came in.</p><br/><p>The doctor looked at Ning Xueluo with a less-than-positive expression. \u201cMrs. Su, your report is out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression darkened when she saw the doctor\u2019s body language. \u201cI still don\u2019t have a baby?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor nodded. \u201cYes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She then comforted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Su. You\u2019re still young. It\u2019s only been a year since you\u2019ve been married. Be patient and there\u2019ll be many more chances in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo soured and was laughing coldly on the inside.</p><br/><p>Be patient?</p><br/><p>If she kept on being patient, she would surely lose her position as Mrs. Su!</p></div>\n</div>"}

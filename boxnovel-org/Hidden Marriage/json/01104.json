Why didn\u2019t you tell me that that girl is Lu Tingxiao\u2019s woman?\"</p><br/><p>\"Didn\u2019t I tell you earlier?\" Mo Lingtian saw that the man was panting and sweating like he had been chased by a beast.</p><br/><p>\"When?!\" Wang Shengzhe almost broke down.</p><br/><p>\"I told you to not mess with trouble. Think! Just how many people could give you trouble in Imperial? You'd know after some careful deduction,\" said Mo Lingtian as a matter-of-factly.</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe freaked out. \"Oh no! What should I do?! I actually flirted with Lu Tingxiao\u2019s woman! Should I buy something for her as an apology? She seems to like Spirit\u2019s clothes. Should I buy her a few?\"</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian stared at him like he was an idiot. \"That girl is the owner of Spirit!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe was once again speechless.</p><br/><p>From an outsider's point of view, they had seen Wang Shengzhe flirting with the girl and then, Lu Tingxiao walked over. As it was a corner, everyone could only see Lu Tingxiao\u2019s back as he blocked Ning Xi, so everyone thought Lu Tingxiao had said something to Wang Shengzhe. The supposed Casanova ran away like that corner of the room was haunted\u2026</p><br/><p>What exactly did Lu Tingxiao say to him?</p><br/><p>Still, there were also people who understood what had happened.</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha... Wang Shengzhe is really looking for trouble! He even flirted with Lu Tingxiao\u2019s woman!\" Ling Fei roared.</p><br/><p>Most people did not know what had happened because only a few people who were close to Lu Tingxiao knew the girl\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>Zhao Haisheng held his wife close. \"But you can\u2019t blame Wang Shengzhe. Who would\u2019ve thought a girl here would turn out to be Lu Tingxiao\u2019s girlfriend!?\"</p><br/><p>\"Speaking of which, do Lu Tingxiao and Miss Ning plan to keep their relationship hidden?\" Ling Fei asked.</p><br/><p>\"I heard that because of Miss Ning\u2019s career, they can\u2019t publicize their relationship!\" Zhao Haisheng said.</p><br/><p>Ling Fei looked at the girl\u2019s direction. \"I actually think this girl is pretty nice. If any other female celebrity were to hook up with Lu Tingxiao, she would surely announce it to the whole world. Do you know Su Yimo from Glory World Entertainment? She\u2019s totally unrelated to Lu Tingxiao, but she always calls herself Mrs. Lu or Lu Tingxiao\u2019s true love... But in truth? Lu Tingxiao probably doesn't even know who she is!\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s true! Although we\u2019ve just met twice, she\u2019s pretty nice and quite special, always scaring us with her stunts, hahaha\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At a quiet corner in the garden, Guan Rui was holding a wine glass, looking absent-mindedly in the direction of the pond.</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao looked nervous. \"Father...are you sure that this method...is really okay?\"</p><br/><p>Guan Rui sipped some wine. \"There're a lot of government officials among the guests today. There\u2019s even a personnel from the law department and Judge Liang is also here... If she killed someone here, even Lu Tingxiao can't help her! While he might be able to spare her from death, do you think a murderer could ever enter the Lu family?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

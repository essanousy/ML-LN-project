But today she found out that there was at least one person who paid attention to her.</p><br/><p>Bai Lu was a little excited and with a shaky voice, she said, \"Thank you...Ning Xi, I\u2019m really thankful! As for getting an award...I wouldn\u2019t even think about it as long as I can stay in the company and make ends meet\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bai Lu then smiled bitterly, \"Actually, I\u2019ve thought of a career change before, but I\u2019ve realized that 10 years is far too long and acting has already become a part of my life. I don\u2019t know anything else aside from acting\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi understood how Bai Lu felt and she continued to encourage her, \"Sis Bai Lu, I have a hunch! You\u2019ll get popular! My hunches are usually very accurate!\"</p><br/><p>Bai Lu smiled at Ning Xi. Even though she knew that she was comforting her, she still felt touched. \"Hopefully, it\u2019ll come true!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah! It\u2019s time! I\u2019m already late! I\u2019ll talk to you next time! Goodbye, Sis Bai Lu!\" Ning Xi looked at her watch and realizing that she was already half an hour late, she quickly parted with Bai Lu and ran upstairs.</p><br/><p>\"Goodbye\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi reached Ling Zhizhi\u2019s office, panting.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was really annoyed. When she saw her, he tossed aside his game console, \"Ning Xi! You did this on purpose, didn\u2019t you? You make me wait so long every single time! Do you know how much money I earn every minute? Do you know how precious my time is?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi said self-righteously, \"Blondie, are you even a gentleman? I\u2019m a girl, what\u2019s wrong with waiting for me for a while?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye almost fell off the chair, \"Huh, a girl? Now you realize that you\u2019re a girl!\"</p><br/><p>Why did she not remember that she was a girl when she hit him back then?</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll be one whenever I want to be!\" Ning Xi replied him indignantly, then she walked towards Ling Zhizhi apologizing, \"Sis Zhizhi, I\u2019m really, really sorry! Something got in the way and made me late! Sorry for making you wait!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was already used to this biased treatment.</p><br/><p>While Ling Zhizhi was used to their arguments, she looked at her warily and said, \"Got into trouble with Su Yimo?\"</p><br/><p>Crap! Sis Zhizhi found out!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was shocked, then proceeded to pour praises, \"Sis Zhizhi, you even know about that! It just happened practically a few seconds ago! You\u2019re like another Zhuge Kongming! You know everything without even needing to step outside!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was speechless.</p><br/><p>Ling Zhizhi stayed silent for a few seconds, then looked at her, \"The news was spread all over the company network.\"</p><br/><p>\"Uhh\u2026\" Ning Xi was at a loss for words. She had praised her for the wrong thing!</p><br/><p>\"Hmm, so it's all over the network...everyone just loves to gossip, don\u2019t they?\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Trouble with Su Yimo? What happened?\" Jiang Muye felt left out and he walked towards Ling Zhizhi\u2019s table and took over her computer mouse.</p><br/><p>Because Jiang Muye came over, Ling Zhizhi appeared a little uneasy but she returned to her usual calm expression quickly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went over to look at the screen as well and she did not notice Ling Zhizhi\u2019s slight change in expression.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

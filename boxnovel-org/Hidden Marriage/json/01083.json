She felt really helpless.</p><br/><p>Six franchise stores but only Lu Xinyan\u2019s shop was doing so badly. With a manager and salespeople of that standard, plus an amateur owner, the store would definitely close down sooner or later. It was a good thing that Ning Xi found out about it early\u2026</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi was deep in thought, a person suddenly flashed by and collided with her, making her almost fall.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m sorry, lady, are you alright?\" The person stopped and held Ning Xi to avoid her from falling down.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shook her head. \"I\u2019m okay.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah...lady, you seem pretty agile. Have you learnt martial arts before?\" The man looked at her with perked interest.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could not help but roll her eyes. Just where was he from, calling her \"lady\" like an ancient, old man?</p><br/><p>\"Haha, I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re alright. I have to flee.\" The man smiled and looked back, his smile growing wider.</p><br/><p>Flee?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi tilted her head and raised her eyebrows questioningly.</p><br/><p>Before Ning Xi could say anything, numerous running footsteps came from the back. About a dozen people were running towards their direction.</p><br/><p>\"Are...they your enemies?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was taken aback. Who exactly was he to be chased by a dozen of people in the middle of the night?</p><br/><p>\"Haha!\" The man laughed, \"I don\u2019t know them, but I saw that they fought pretty well against each other. They couldn\u2019t decide the winner after quite some time, so I beat them up instead. Who knew they'd have guns? Haha, no matter how good I am, I can\u2019t be faster than bullets!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh...how are you not dead by now then?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was impressed by the man\u2019s shameless attitude. He had offended some people and was chased by a dozen of them, yet he was still acting tough.</p><br/><p>And people were fighting on their own, so why did he involve himself? Was he asking for trouble?</p><br/><p>\"Farewell, milady, I have to go!\"</p><br/><p>As the man was about to flee, Ning Xi held him back.</p><br/><p>\"Follow me.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi dragged the man and forced him under a SUV.</p><br/><p>\"You...what are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>The man was taken aback by her action.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at him smilingly. \"Luck is in your favor. I like your adventurous attitude!\"</p><br/><p>And...everything she was interested in\u2026</p><br/><p>This man had just so happened to possess them all.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stopped talking to him. She stood in front of the car and blocked the man from the sight of his pursuers. A short while, the dozen of people reached her.</p><br/><p>\"First...First Senior Brother?!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's eyes flew wide open when she saw a familiar face framed by a pair of glasses.</p><br/><p>The man at the front was Tang Ye! The more outrageous fact was not only that Tang Ye was there, Tang Lang was also beside him!</p><br/><p>How had they ended up together?</p><br/><p>\"Little Junior Sister, why are you here?\" Tang Lang asked while panting.</p><br/><p>\"Second Senior Brother? I\u2019m about to ask you guys! What are you guys doing? Why are you with First Brother Senior?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Could the man under the car be hunted by Tang Ye and Tang Lang?</p><br/><p>Really? Who exactly was that man who was able to make Tang Ye and Tang Lang cooperate?</p><br/><p>Ugh...wait... Just now, that man mentioned that he saw two people were fighting and that he beat them up because they could not decide the winner after a long time. Could the people he was talking about be First Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

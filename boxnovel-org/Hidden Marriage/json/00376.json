Why is he giving us this?\"</p><br/><p>\"Thanks to you, their hotel was able to be involved in this popular event, saving them a lot of advertisement fees! A platinum card is nothing compared to that!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed as she could not explain what happened tonight to anyone, so she just accepted it, \"Fine, then you should keep it!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah? Me?\" Xiao Tao was surprised.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, my matters in the future will be handled by my loyal assistant: you. It\u2019d be much easier if you kept it!\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Tao\u2019s face reddened, \"Then...then I shall!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Regal Riveria hotel.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi got back to her apartment, she just threw herself onto the bed without doing anything else.</p><br/><p>Tonight was really tiring\u2026</p><br/><p>Her heart was tired\u2026</p><br/><p>She had been worried since yesterday with various conflicts popping up incessantly\u2026</p><br/><p>At this point, she just had no more strength.</p><br/><p>As she lay on the bed and tried to go to sleep, the doorbell suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was exasperated, it was very late already, who could it be? She was starting to develop a phobia for the doorbell!</p><br/><p>It was none of her concern, she thought.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued lying on her bed and did not move an inch, but the doorbell kept on ringing persistently as if it was ringing for its life.</p><br/><p>Finally, Ning Xi got up and opened the door with a gloomy face.</p><br/><p>She heard a really urgent voice from outside, \"Xiao Xi Xi! Open the door! Xiao Xi Xi! Quickly open the door! Xiao Xi Xi! Quickly open the doooooor!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally opened the door, angrily coming face to face with Lu Jingli, \"Second Master! Stop being so loud! It\u2019s very late already, what do you want?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli barged in without hesitation and he excitedly said, \"Xiao Xi Xi! You\u2019re the bomb!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes, \"You\u2019re the one who's the bomb...\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli paced around the living room, mumbling, \"Crap! I really, really, really regret it!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi massaged her temples, \"Stop circling around! What are you trying to say?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli said with a painful expression, \"What I want to say is, why did I go to that boring business cocktail party?! It made me miss such a cool event! And now I can only search for live videos and cry while watching it!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was annoyed, \"Because these boring cocktail parties are bringing you profit! How is gossip more important than profit?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli justified himself, \"How is profit more important than gossip?\"</p><br/><p>\"...right, I forgot that you\u2019re filthy rich! Money is just a number to you. Indeed to you, gossip is more important!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli put a hand to his chest dramatically, \"And...and Danial was there tonight! And Cai Fengxian! Do you know how difficult it is to have a meal prepared by these two? I actually missed it! Missed it! Not just one, but two of them! I really want to die right now!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was annoyed, \"Then you should run over to Royal Jazz hotel now. Maybe you\u2019d get to have some leftovers! What are you doing here at my place?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli did not say anything and he just stared at her with eyes full of hatred and jealousy.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could not stand him anymore, \"Fine, fine. You really are my boss! I knew you couldn't make it and that you really like them, so I brought back something for you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took out an exquisite dessert from the fridge, \"The others were too difficult to bring back, I\u2019ve only got this sweet potato cake here!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Han Zixuan was way too picky!</p><br/><p><em>Just what did she want to wear? The emperor\u2019s robe?</em></p><br/><p>Ning Xi impressed everyone with just a plain white <em>qipao</em> !</p><br/><p>The people make the clothes!</p><br/><p>If the person was simply no good, being picky about the outfit was a futile effort\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, she would never say something so rude, so she just went out quietly and continued looking.</p><br/><p>Shortly after the stylist left, Zheng Anru entered.</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru instantly understood what had happened when she saw the dresses strewn all around the room and Han Zixuan\u2019s expression. She went over and spoke in a lighthearted tone, \u201cYou\u2019re still troubled over the dresses! Just what can they get you? Don\u2019t worry, CEO Ning has already arranged for someone to get you something from overseas. It\u2019ll arrive before tomorrow night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan\u2019s expression softened when she heard her manager. If CEO Ning was helping her, then there would be no issue at all.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Han Zixuan looked up at Zheng Anru and asked, \u201cDid you find out anything about Ning Xi\u2019s show?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru laughed. \u201cI found out that they\u2019ve been practicing. It\u2019s just some old opera show. Just what are they thinking?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOpera?\u201d Han Zixuan let out a snort.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe thought she\u2019s being unique and is just trying to act cool! Doesn\u2019t she know what era we\u2019re in now? Just who\u2019d still be interested in that kind of stuff? It\u2019ll be funny if the audience falls asleep!\u201d Zheng Anru brutally mocked.</p><br/><p>She then said with excitement, \u201cYour dance, on the other hand, will surely surprise everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Soon, the day came.</p><br/><p>In Xu Tao\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>A young female artiste sat on the sofa with her fingers crossed. She seemed in distress. \u201cBro Tao\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 It\u2019s such a heavy responsibility\u2026 If I mess it up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao tried to convince her, \u201cQin Shuang, you\u2019ve been in the industry for so many years. I know you\u2019ve been very hardworking. You just needed a chance, and now the chance is here. Wouldn\u2019t you be a fool for pushing this opportunity away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Shuang still looked worried. \u201cDid Bro Xi suddenly change to another show, so I\u2019m replacing her as the female lead? It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help. I\u2019m really worried that I\u2019m not good enough\u2026 I might cause trouble to the company\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s just a little artiste who did not have the right to attend this important event and play such a key role.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi did not change the show. She\u2019s just playing a different character.\u201d Xu Tao did not explain further and continued to convince her, \u201cWhat are you afraid of? If you can\u2019t believe in yourself, why don\u2019t you believe in me and Ning Xi?</p><br/><p>You\u2019re from a performing arts school and you\u2019ve been performing in opera shows before. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re really familiar with \u2018The Phantom of the Opera\u2019. The role is meant for you! Ning Xi mentioned to me before that she wanted you to be noticed. Your chance is here and now, you silly girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Shuang felt even more pressured after hearing Xu Tao. \u201cI still think that I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao tried everything to convince her, and she still would not agree. He was close to giving up.</p><br/><p>This girl was sweet. She had always been a steadfast person, but her steadfast personality was what hindered her, making her too afraid to experience new things.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

With all of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded and indicated for her to take a look herself.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was worried that she wouldn\u2019t understand at first, but in the end, she found that Lu Tingxiao wasn\u2019t trying to get her to look at those complicated lines of code, but was simply showing her the results on the screen.</p><br/><p>The IP address of the sender was traced back to the apartment building that Ning Xueluo stayed in, Pearl River Grand View. The owner of the anonymous overseas account was Cui Caijing, Ning Xueluo\u2019s assistant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought this kind of hacking only existed on TV! Especially hacking into anonymous accounts since they\u2019re super safe. You have to enter the bank\u2019s system to crack one, it\u2019s practically impossible\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was so excited that she couldn\u2019t speak for a long moment. Finally, she threw her arms around Lu Tingxiao, \u201cBig Boss! You\u2019re amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right then and there, Lu Tingxiao found that he could no longer avoid facing a problem.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi completely trusted in him now, but she had too much faith in him\u2026 to the point that she had forgotten that he was a man!</p><br/><p>To put it simply, she was now treating him like a mentor and a good friend; she even took him for a father at times, but never saw him as a man.</p><br/><p>This was a huge problem\u2026</p><br/><p>However, it was also a good omen. The time that he was waiting for was imminent.</p><br/><p>It was only after he had settled his turbulent emotions that Lu Tingxiao spoke up and asked her a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with all this evidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry to make this evidence public. Let Ning Xueluo continue stirring up trouble. The more trouble she stirs up, the harder she\u2019ll be hit when the time comes! I\u2019m preparing\u2026 preparing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPreparing what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Lu Tingxiao, hold me for a bit, why do I feel like the floor is shaking\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she said \u2018shaking\u2019, Ning Xi\u2019s vision turned black and she collapsed to the floor with a thump.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2014\u2014\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression abruptly changed and he hurriedly caught her.</p><br/><p>The soft body in his arms was on fire. He reached out and touched her forehead, and it was scalding hot.</p><br/><p>He had sensed this heat previously, but he thought that he was simply imagining things. He hadn\u2019t thought that she was really ill.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao picked up the person in his arms and hurriedly ran downstairs: \u201cUncle Yuan! Prepare the car!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old butler was shocked upon seeing the situation, \u201cWhat happened to Miss Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lu Tingxiao was panicking so much that his usual icy mask had cracked.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know! He didn\u2019t know if it was the remainder of the drugs in her system, or if she was simply having a fever. Or perhaps that Zhu Xiangcheng had given her something else?</p><br/><p>Right now, Lu Tingxiao was submerged in self-blame. He should have brought her to the hospital for a checkup at the first possible moment. However, not only had he not done so, he had even delayed sending her to the hospital for so long. He had also tired her out by keeping her so busy.</p><br/><p>So much had happened; she must have been under tremendous pressure. She had probably reached her limit, holding on up till now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Young Master, don\u2019t get too nervous, it looks like Miss Xi is only having a fever. Why don\u2019t we call the family doctor to take a look\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Lu Tingxiao was already deaf to all suggestions. The driver brought the car over and he immediately carried her on board, \u201cTo the hospital!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he then turned to the butler standing outside the car and instructed him, \u201cCall Qin Mufeng over as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d The butler could only helplessly agree.</p><br/><p>If he had still been uncertain before, seeing how Eldest Young Master was acting now, everything would be made clear.</p><br/><p>This girl was most likely going to be their future Eldest Young Mistress.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

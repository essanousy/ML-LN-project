I even gave her a box of lipstick on her first day here, we were on really good terms! She always shares some gossip with me every now and then, but then she was suddenly moved away and the current receptionist is an uncle! Ugh, I\u2019m so angry, give me back my cute girl!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ugh\u2026\" Lu Jingli\u2019s first reaction was to turn over to look at the calm and innocent-looking brother.</p><br/><p>Who else would do something like that?</p><br/><p>His brother\u2019s romantic rivals were everywhere!</p><br/><p>It was busy enough for him to just take care of them everyday\u2026</p><br/><p>After they went up and got out of the lift, Ning Xi walked towards her home and then abruptly stopped at the junction, suddenly stepping backwards.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Xi Xi, what happened? Anything wrong?\" Lu Jingli was confused.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao already saw someone standing in front of her door and he frowned.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed, \"Su Yan.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Su Yan? Your first love? What about him?\"</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s right in front of my door!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli opened his eyes wide, \"What?! What is he trying to do, waiting for you outside your door at midnight? Xiao Xi Xi, I\u2019ll beat him up for you!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at Lu Jingli, then went to Lu Tingxiao. \"Help me hold Little Treasure for now, I\u2019ll go and settle whatever it is with him. I\u2019ll be quick.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded. \"Mmm.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli looked at his brother\u2019s gentle expression, impressed by his brother\u2019s calm act in front of his wife. A thunderstorm was probably brewing in his mind\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Yan had a cigarette between his fingers as he leaned on Ning Xi\u2019s door, looking deep in thought.</p><br/><p>He only noticed Ning Xi when she was right in front of him, acknowledging her as he looked up, \"Xiao Xi, you\u2019re back!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded slightly. \"Has the banquet ended?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, I sent Xueluo back here, so I decided to come here and pay you a visit as well. I thought you\u2019d be home a long time ago. Did something happen?\" Su Yan was concerned, he did not know she was picked up by Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\"Nope, there was a jam. What\u2019s up?\" Ning Xi replied half-heartedly.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had been talking to her all the way home, driving at the speed of a snail\u2026</p><br/><p>\"It was too busy back there just now and I didn\u2019t have time to talk to you properly.\" Su Yan looked at her as if he wanted to say something else.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s quite late already, why don't you just tell me here?\"</p><br/><p>Su Yan hesitated. \"There\u2019s something I wanted to remind you, Xiao Xi. I\u2019m afraid that it would be a little awkward if you decide to go back to the Ning family now\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh? What\u2019s awkward?\" Ning Xi raised her eyebrows and questioned.</p><br/><p>Under the dim light, her bright eyes shone beautifully. Su Yan\u2019s breathing slowed down and her beauty stole his breath away. He nearly forgot what he wanted to say and only broke out of his reverie after a while\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

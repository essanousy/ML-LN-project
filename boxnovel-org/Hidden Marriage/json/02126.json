She walked right up to Annie. \u201cBegin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to die?!\u201d Ning Xi had just steadied herself when Yun Shen pulled her away.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi fought back and pulled away from Yun Shen\u2019s grip. \u201cDon\u2019t get in my way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Yun Shen was so angry that he stared with fire in his eyes towards Lu Tingxiao beside him. \u201cDo you still have a say in this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s thin lips pursed, he looked extremely miserable. \u201cXiao Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was about to speak when Ning Xi interrupted him, \u201cLu Tignxiao, don\u2019t make me hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao instantly turned pale and he could not utter a word.</p><br/><p>Next, Ning Xi\u2019s eyes swept across everyone who was there. \u201cNo one is allowed to do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was running out of time already!</p><br/><p>Then, she immediately looked to Annie and commanded, \u201cAnnie, begin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie walked step by step to the girl. Her figure struck Ning Xi at the speed of lgiht.</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft!!!\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s entire body was like a kite that had its string cut. She flew quite a few meters away and hit the cold wall hard. Then, she spat out a mouthful of blood on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone cried out in alarm.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held out a hand and stopped everyone from going up to her. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was about to go crazy. What!? How could she be fine!? He had felt Annie\u2019s blow and he understood her strength all too well!</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue!\u201d Ning Xi staggered towards Annie.</p><br/><p>Bam! Came another strike.</p><br/><p>This time, Ning Xi was struck to the ground. She did not move at all as the blood from her mouth dripped onto the cold floor.</p><br/><p>She used up all of her might before she could finally brace herself into kneeling halfway, then she wavered as she stood up again.</p><br/><p>However, her figure looked like she would collapse any second now.</p><br/><p>She definitely could not handle a third strike!</p><br/><p>She would really die!</p><br/><p>\u201cDumbass! Are you insane?!\u201d Yun Shen could not hold back anymore and he started to rush up to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shouted, \u201cLu Tingxiao, hold him back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost the instant Ning Xi said that, Lu Tingxiao held out his hand and blocked Yun Shen who was about to rush over.</p><br/><p>Yun Shen looked at this man in disbelief. \u201cF*ck! She\u2019s going mad?! Are you being crazy with her too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stood tall and unmoving in front of Yun Shen like a weathered thousand-year statue. He did not move, apeparing indestructible, yet in reality, he could be crushed into pieces in the next second\u2026</p><br/><p>While Lu Tingxiao held Yun Shen off, Ning Xi dragged her heavy footsteps as if she was lugging a mountain with her and she returned extremely slowly to Annie again. \u201cLast hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie did not say anything. She just stared at Ning Xi unmoving.</p><br/><p>It was not sure how long had passed before Annie finally said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s hearts were in their throats. Tang Lang, Tang Ye, and Feng Xiaoxiao were all ready to charge in to stop her.</p><br/><p>Finally, Annie made her move. That palm strike that seemed as if bore the force of a thunderbolt swiftly made its way towards Ning XI\u2026</p><br/><p>When Tang Lang and the rest noticed how powerful the force was, the speed of the strike was too quick and they were too late to stop it.</p><br/><p>Thus, they could only watch helplessly as Ning Xi endure this blow\u2026</p><br/><p>The entire hospital corridors were dead silent.</p><br/><p>Yet, in the next second\u2026</p><br/><p>The thing that they had expected to happen never happened.</p><br/><p>As the strike landed, Ning Xi did not topple over!</p><br/><p>Annie\u2019s palm was close to Ning Xi\u2019s chest area. With a closer look, one would realize that it looked like she had hit her but there was actually an extremely minute gap. She had not hit her.</p></div>\n</div>"}

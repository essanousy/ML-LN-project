If this was their main headquarters, she would be better off staying put for now.</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi prepared to leave, she saw a man around 50 years of age getting chased out of the villa and being pushed to the ground.</p><br/><p>\"You...you bastards, this is my house! You can\u2019t do this to me! You just can\u2019t!\" the middle-aged man roared in agony, his eyes full of hatred.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, who do you think you are? You might not even see daybreak tomorrow, you idiot!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, my dear Lou, it\u2019s been rainy these days, how would he even see the sun?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Idiots, it\u2019s a joke! You don\u2019t get my sense of humor!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Get out of my house now!\" the middle-aged man shouted as he struggled to get up from the ground while pointing at those people.</p><br/><p>\"You damned old man, get lost!\" A young man slapped the middle-aged man\u2019s right cheek heavily. The middle-aged man fell down again.</p><br/><p>\"Pa!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m going to trample you to death!\"</p><br/><p>A few young men started kicking the middle-aged man on the floor while using all kinds of profanity to curse him.</p><br/><p>As they were attacking the middle-aged man, Ning Xi had already sneaked into the villa. She then realized that it was just an ordinary villa and not where Jeffrey was.</p><br/><p>After searching, she exited the villa from the main door.</p><br/><p>\"You old man, I\u2019m taking your head off today. Do you actually think that you could get through the night?! Hahaha! The boss told us to snuff your life out!\"</p><br/><p>\"Lou, where\u2019s his dog? Let me do it!\"</p><br/><p>\"Bastard, you watch too many movies! You're just looking for trouble now!\" laughed the young man named Lou.</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>They suddenly saw a lady step out of the villa.</p><br/><p>Lou\u2019s men were confused. Who was this woman and why was she in the villa?</p><br/><p>\"You! Lady! Yes, I\u2019m talking to you, don\u2019t look anywhere else. Look at me!\" Lou stopped kicking the middle-aged man and blocked Ning Xi\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stood there expressionless.</p><br/><p>\"Who are you and why would you be in the villa in the first place?\" Lou asked as he assessed Ning Xi and when he saw her adorable face, he smiled maliciously.</p><br/><p>\"Is this your house?\" Ning Xi asked him instead.</p><br/><p>\"What did you say?!\" Lou\u2019s expression changed. No one had ever talked to him in such a tone!</p><br/><p>\"Lady, I\u2019m Solomon's new boss, Jeffrey\u2019s brother, Lou. Don't you know who I am? If you don\u2019t, I can tell you in detail in bed with me tonight!\" Lou said fiercely.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

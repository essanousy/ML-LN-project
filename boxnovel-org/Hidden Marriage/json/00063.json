The best one was undoubtedly number 8, where Evil Demon King Lu stayed. There was a lake and garden at the back, and even a personal golf course, it took up the most land area. The next one was Lu Jingli\u2019s residence, number 7, and on the same tier was number 6.</p><br/><p>No one had known who the owner of number 6 was, who would have thought that it would be this fellow, Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Lei Ming was about to turn right, Ning Xi subconsciously opened her mouth to remind him, \u201cAh, Ming-ge, don\u2019t drive that way, that road\u2019s blocked\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know that road\u2019s blocked?\u201d Jiang Muye immediately asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s heart thumped, but she acted calm on the surface and rolled her eyes at him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see the warning sign there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, that road had been smashed up by a drunk driving rich heir, and she had seen it herself yesterday.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye glanced at the \u2018Road Under Maintenance\u2019 sign by the roadside and made a sound of agreement.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Although she had legitimate reasons for staying at Lu Tingxiao\u2019s, explaining it would be troublesome, plus it would be so hard to maintain her innocence. Why not save on trouble where she could!</p><br/><p>When they reached their destination, Ning Xi\u2019s face was full of hidden bitterness, she really wanted to sneak home and hug Little Treasure!</p><br/><p>Lei Ming got down and asked Muye, \u201cSomeone has been keeping this place clean, so you can just move in directly. See if you want to stay here or move into the apartment the company has arranged? If you want to stay here, it might be a little inconvenient to commute here and back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was thinking in her heart, please don\u2019t stay here! What if we meet each other someday?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it and let you know later!\u201d Jiang Muye waved him away impatiently, casting an urging look at Lei Ming.</p><br/><p>Lei Ming sighed before looking at the two of them. He couldn\u2019t seem to stop worrying as he nagged, \u201cBoth of you, don\u2019t sleep too late. Muye, don\u2019t forget you still have that event tomorrow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know!\u201d Jiang Muye just ignored him, and then pulled Ning Xi along like a bandit as he slipped inside the house.</p><br/><p>Lei Ming: \u201c\u2026\u201d He had already lost all hope that these two would be able to get up in the morning\u2026</p><br/><p>After entering the house, Jiang Muye counted on his fingers as if he was getting ready for war, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to Ming-ge\u2019s nonsense. Ning Xi, tonight you have to accompany me for 300 rounds of war! I want to see if I can\u2019t kill you today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi cast a sidelong glance at him with disdain, \u201cHehe, then come at me! You\u2019ve suffered so many defeats under my hand and you still dare to spout such boasts! I\u2019ll make you call me granny!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn your dreams! You\u2019re gonna be the one calling me grandpa!\u201d Jiang Muye buried his head in his giant luggage and rummaged about, \u201cI brought back the latest setup from overseas, you\u2019re profiting from this!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he turned to her as if she were a spectacle too horrible to endure, \u201cYou. Hurry up and go wash all that off, you\u2019re piercing my eyes here! Are you trying to use this to lower my battle spirit? Shameless! I\u2019m not going to admit my losses, I\u2019m telling you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLower my ass, I should be lowering my own skills. Do you think I enjoy this disguise?\u201d Ning Xi pulled off the heavy wig on her head and unbuttoned her collar. This was practically abusing herself while trying to hurt the enemy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye switched on the widescreen TV in the living room and started to connect the cables, \u201cI have clothes in my room, look for one that fits you yourself! Hurry up, hurry up! My battle spirit is already so hungry it\u2019s difficult to hold it back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Ning Xi stared at his excited appearance speechlessly.</p><br/><p>Other people would find some hot chick to bang once they returned to their home country, but this guy\u2026 he was dragging her to play games with him by hook or by crook, even wanting her to play through the night! He was totally crazy!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Thank you!\"</p><br/><p>Father Xi\u2019s expression softened. \"You don\u2019t have to pressure yourself too much. His decision isn\u2019t related to you anyway but just give it a try!\"</p><br/><p>They tried to conceal their intense worry when comforting Ning Xi since she was now their only hope left.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a deep breath and walked towards the room Xi Shiqing was in.</p><br/><p>Ning Zhiyuan mumbled, \"Let\u2019s hope that Xiao Xi can really persuade Shiqing\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He was actually not confident at all. Shiqing looked really determined and probably nothing could deter him even if his reason for becoming a monk was related to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi finally reached the room.</p><br/><p>Following a path of mossy green pebbles, there was a quiet yard where flowers bloomed amongst lush bamboo plants and zen seemed to be gentle dynamic energy flowing around.</p><br/><p>The door to the room was opened and a curtain billowed in the wind. The air was silent but not stifling still as if it was a different world compared to the outside.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went up to the entrance and hesitated a little, then she lifted the curtain up.</p><br/><p>Through the window, Xi Shiqing sat quietly behind a screen full of Buddhist scriptures with a scripture in his hands. He was obviously very focused on going through it.</p><br/><p>Despite wearing a suit, he already imbued the character of a monk\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi realized that she actually felt frightened of this version of Xi Shiqing.</p><br/><p>It had just been one night. How did he suddenly change into such a different person?</p><br/><p>He was a clean-cut man before but a worldly one. The Xi Shiqing before Ning Xi now seemed as if he had lost all his earthly desires.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had a splitting headache throbbing. Xi Shiqing\u2019s situation was much direr than she had thought!</p><br/><p>She could not back out now. She had to take responsibility for what she had done and the people outside were waiting for her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I won\u2019t repeat it in the future!\u201d Ning Xuelo almost bit off her tongue saying this sentence.</p><br/><p>It seems that this time, the things stirred up and aroused Su Yan\u2019s guilty heart. He no longer easily doubts Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>But so what? Since he doesn\u2019t believe what others say, she just have to look for opportunities to let him see with his own eyes. Then he will believe me!</p><br/><p>Looking for Ning Xi\u2019s flaws is too easy. The relationship between her and Jiang Muye is already unclear. With the addition of a child, things will get really interesting!</p><br/><p>However, for the time being, she needs to be temporarily tolerant, and play down the talk of her guilt to Su Yan.</p><br/><p>Outside of the shopping mall,</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Little Treasure were preparing to go home, when they suddenly saw that the car supposed to be waiting for them is gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, our car?\u201d Ning Xi is very confused.</p><br/><p>Has it been stolen?</p><br/><p>But how could it be stolen, there are drivers\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The bodyguard following them replied: \u201cMiss, our car has been taken away because the boss just called. He\u2019s coming from work to pick you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Ning Xi hastily said, \u201cWhat\u2019s with that? Why do we have to wait, we can go without him. What if he decided to work overtime or dilly dally somewhere\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Ning Xi could finish her statement, a black Maybach came to a smooth stop in front of them. The back seat window slowly dropped down, revealing an expressionless face, \u201cTaking a stroll?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gave a stiff nod.</p><br/><p>Because these days she has been going to bed in the early evening to try and avoid making contact with Lu Ting Xiao. So although they live under one roof, she hasn\u2019t seen him for two whole days.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm!\u201d Ning Xi opened the door and allowed Little Treasure to enter. Then she went towards the passenger seat to sit in front.</p><br/><p>As a result, one of the guards trembling in fear and trepidation said, \u201cMiss, the passenger seat is not safe so I\u2019ll sit there. You sit in the back, it\u2019s very spacious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Ning Xi once again opened the back seat and entered the car. Although the little bun is sitting in the middle, separating them, Ning Xi moved as far as possible to the end of the seat.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao has the same attitude as usual, staring at his laptop and quickly tapping on the keyboard, his expression focused.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Ning Xi is a little relieved.</p><br/><p>As a result, ten minutes later, Lu Ting Xiao seems to have finished handling things. He put the computer down to the side, placed a drowsy Little Treasure on his lap, then naturally shifted his position, turning towards Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>The familiar atmosphere was suddenly violated, turning chilly as the distance reduced. Ning Xi hair quickly rose up as she subconsciously retreated towards the door, her face almost pasted to the window\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2026\u2026\u201d Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s voice sounded in her ear</p><br/><p>\u201cYes? What?\u201d Ning Xi replied turning her head</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao continued to look at her and unhurriedly asked, \u201cAre you hiding from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! How\u2026\u2026how can I? Why do you think I want to hide? It\u2019s just that outside, the sun behind the cloud looks very beautiful! I am enjoying the scenery\u2026\u2026I\u2019m only looking at the scenery\u2026\u2026\u201d Ning Xi finished with a whoosh.</p><br/><p>As a result, at this time, somehow, the driver in front suddenly made a sharp turning, causing Ning Xi\u2019s body to fly towards and land on Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s brow rose, and he stretched his arm protectively around her shoulder and didn\u2019t move it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry boss, it\u2019s just that a car suddenly swerved into our lane!\u201d the driver, Cheng Feng reported.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cOkay, then drive carefully. I\u2019ll increase your wages.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Feng: \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>From the housekeeper to the body guards to the driver. Why is it that everyone seems to be assisting Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s illusion?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We're from the same company after all,\" Ning Xi replied.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's down-to-earth attitude made Li Yiqing feel even more grateful. \"Sis Xi, my grandfather is a traditional Chinese medicine doctor and he's really good at massaging. I've been learning from him since I was a child. Do you want me to give you a massage?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled. \"It's alright, you can work on your stuff. Don't let me affect your work.\"</p><br/><p>Li Yiqing shook her head. \"Not really, I've finished my audition already! Let me help you with a massage as a token of appreciation of what happened just now. If not, I'd feel really bad about it!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi saw the girl's passionate eyes, so she could not reject her. \"Alright then, thank you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" Li Yiqing stood behind Ning Xi gleefully, her pale little hands on Ning Xi's shoulders and she started massaging.</p><br/><p>Although she looked petite, she had quite some strength. The way she massaged was really comfortable.</p><br/><p>Li Yiqing frowned a little as she was massaging. \"Sis Xi, have you been stressed lately? Your shoulder muscles are really strained!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked into the mirror and mumbled, \"Mmm, a little\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Tao was watching Li Yiqing's actions. \"Looks great to know this. I'll learn from you, then I'll be able to help Bro Xi massage the next time!\"</p><br/><p>Li Yiqing replied, \"Sure! I'll teach you!\"</p><br/><p>When Jiang Muye came in, he saw someone enjoying the company of girls left and right, so he looked a little annoyed. \"You really know how to enjoy yourself, huh?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Senior Jiang!\" Li Yiqing greeted when she saw it was Jiang Muye. She explained, \"Sis Xi helped me out just now, so I'm just massaging her as a token of appreciation!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, get out now. I have something to talk about with this girl!\" Jiang Muye shooed her out of the room.</p><br/><p>Both Li Yiqing and Xiao Tao knew that Jiang Muye was on good terms with Ning Xi, so they both left quickly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was unhappy when Jiang Muye chased her girls away. \"What?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye looked at her disdainfully. \"Look at how relaxed you are. Your death is coming upon you and you're still flirting around\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean? Can you not jinx me this early in the morning?\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you know...who the secondary male lead of this movie is?\" Jiang Muye asked.</p><br/><p>\"What does that have to do with me?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye raised his eyebrows. \"Are you sure? The secondary male lead is Mo Yuxiu!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly shot to her feet. \"Are you kidding me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Kidding you? He's already here! Right outside!\" Jiang Muye plopped down on a chair.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! That can't be\u2026\" Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>As the old saying went, there could not be two tigers in the same territory. At </p><br/><p>\"Because of you, that guy was willing to stand below me and become a secondary male lead! Ning Xiao Xi, look at you!\" Jiang Muye taunted her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xu's expression darkened. \"Damn it! I'm already troubled enough\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

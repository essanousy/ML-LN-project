I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re not good but rather Lu Ting Xiao is too dangerous. The Lu family environment is not good for you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMuye, thank you for looking out for me. But my own heart is clear.\u201d Ning Xi interrupted him, her look completely back to normal. \u201cRest assured, I\u2019m not being irrational just because of my heart. I know what I am doing, and what I should be focused on.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jiang Muye heard her say this, he was not the slightest bit happy. Instead, his chest felt like a soaked sponge, holes leaking with no plug in sight. \u201cWhat do you look like? You are earnest in your efforts to progress, you know when to love and when to hate. You are only worthy of the best of the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned for a moment, then gave him a surprised look. \u201cI did not expect such golden, kind words from you. You\u2019re not in love with me right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye stiffened immediately, \u201cYou brat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha ha\u2026\u201d Ning Xi clutched her belly laughing, then turned and looked at him. \u201cJiang Muye, before you say anything. You and I know each other a lot right? I can only show you this side since we are such good friends and have known each other for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi looked at him at that moment, Jiang Muye almost thought that she saw through his heart and specifically said those words to make him remind him to give up on her\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu House.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao is sitting on the living room couch, focused completely on the German book in his hand.</p><br/><p>In contrast, Lu Jingli was wandering around the house, ignoring the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what they talked about? I have a hunch! The content will certainly be the best! The relationship between you and a certain lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao turned the page, note even sparing him a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey brother, I blame you anyway. You\u2019re too old fashioned, that\u2019s why I wanted people to secretly bug them but you won\u2019t let me! Now you can only stay at home and be anxious!\u201d Lu Jingli complained</p><br/><p>Although from the current situation, the only one anxious is him.</p><br/><p>Finally, even Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s patience cannot stand his noisiness: \u201cBe quiet or go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t! I won\u2019t go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>He also wants to wait for the evenings gossip. Otherwise how can he sleep tonight!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost eleven o\u2019clock, how come she\u2019s not back?\u201d Lu Jingli anxiously scratched his cheek. Just then, his cell phone rang displaying a strange number.</p><br/><p>So late, I wonder who\u2019s calling me?\u201d Lu Jingli grabbed his phone and went to the yard to answer it.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later, Lu Jingli came flying into the living room, \u201cYou really just dozed off, should I get you a pillow! Brother, you won\u2019t guess what I just got! Actually, this evening, somebody bugged Ning Xi and Jiang Muye\u2019s booth. Some little puppy tried to send out the recording but fortunately, their boss had a filter that immediately stopped it, but also sent it to me as an offer to make amends.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

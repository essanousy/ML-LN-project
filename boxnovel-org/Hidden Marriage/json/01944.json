They quickly went to see Ning Xueluo. In their own world, they did not notice the odd looks on the faces of the trio from the Su family.</p><br/><p>After the two of them entered the ward, Zheng Minjun immediately cursed under her breath, \u201cDid the hospital get it wrong? How could she have gotten pregnant now of all times!? Su Yan was already prepared to divorce her, yet she\u2019s pregnant now. What do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang frowned and glared at his wife. \u201cSofter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, his expression seemed jumbled too.</p><br/><p>On one hand, he felt regretful. On the other hand, it was still the Su family\u2019s flesh and blood in Xueluo.</p><br/><p>They had been anticipating it for so long, and now the Su family finally had an heir.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you have to tell me what do we do now!\u201d Zheng Minjun urged anxiously.</p><br/><p>When she saw that the golden phoenix in their hand was going to vanish just like that, even a grandchild could not make her any happier.</p><br/><p>After all, they would have a grandchild sooner or later, but from whose womb? That was a huge difference in the story!</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s mind was blank now. He did not say a word at all.</p><br/><p>At last, it was Su Hongguang who said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s best if we reconsider the divorce! Now, none of you are allowed to mention it, especially when the in-laws are still here.\u201d</p><br/><p>To bring up a divorce right now would definitely make the Ning family cause a huge ruckus.</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun understood this too, yet her heart was still unwilling. Nevertheless, silence was all they could resort to.</p><br/><p>In the ward.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, Mother\u2026 Why are you here? What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Ning Xi slowly came to, looking confused.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu held Ning Xueluo\u2019s hand gleefully. \u201cXueluo, you\u2019re pregnant! You\u2019re going to be a mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo went blank for a second, then she gaped in disbelief and was pleasantly surprised. \u201cReally? Mother! I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe doctor already said so. Could he be wrong? You! You\u2019re so thoughtless! You only realize it after three months! You even fainted at home! You made us worry!\u201d Zhuang Lingyu looked distressed as she reproached her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu suddenly thought of something and said coldly, \u201cWhat are you sorry for? Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know. It must be that damned brat who\u2019s causing you trouble the moment she returned! Otherwise, would you have worked this hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she was worried that all this annoyance would disturb her, so she quickly consoled her, \u201cNow, your main duty is to nourish your fetus. Leave all those company matters to the others! Nothing is more important than your health and the child\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, Mother, I got it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Su Hongguang and Zheng Minjun walked in too, symbolically muttering a few caring words.</p><br/><p>After that, everyone else moved out to let Su Yan and Ning Xueluo be alone.</p><br/><p>When only the two of them were left in the ward, Ning Xueluo instantly blushed shyly and was in high spirits. \u201cBro Yan, we finally have a child! I\u2019m so happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan looked at the girl on the sickbed who was ignorant of worldly affairs and was without an inkling of anything. While she was pleased about carrying his child, his heart was filled with strife.</p><br/><p>On both sides of the scale, one was a true love that he had retrieved with much difficulty while the other was a girl who had been by his side for so many years.</p><br/><p>He had already decided on giving Ning Xi a proper title, yet now at this moment, facing the present Ning Xueluo, he really could not bring himself to say the word \u201cdivorce\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 am very happy too, but the way you passed out today was so dangerous! From now on, you rest well. Leave everything else to me. I\u2019ll handle them for you,\u201d assured Su Yan.</p><br/><p>There was a hidden smirk in Ning Xueluo\u2019s eyes. Outwardly, she seemed touched and nestled against the man\u2019s embrace. \u201cBro Yan, thank you!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

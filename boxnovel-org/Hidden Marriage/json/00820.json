What just happened?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao kissed Ning Xi!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi actually succeeded in getting a kiss?</p><br/><p>That was not exactly right. Ning Xi did not even ask. She gave up trying, but Lu Tingxiao still kissed her!</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo almost broke her glass, then she heard the sound of glasses breaking and beside her, Su Yan\u2019s wine glass fell onto the floor.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry...I...I need to go to the washroom\u2026\" Su Yan quickly went out.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo looked unhappy as she noticed Su Yan\u2019s reaction. What did he mean by this? Why was he so worked up to see another man kiss Ning Xi?</p><br/><p>She thought she already had total control over Su Yan, that he only had guilt towards Ning Xi, but at that moment, a sense of urgency floated up in her mind\u2026</p><br/><p>What troubled her the most was that Lu Tingxiao actually kissed Ning Xi! How was this possible!?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao sat down on the sofa casually and ignored everyone\u2019s gaze as if he did not just do something outrageous.</p><br/><p>Realizing Ning Xi was still staring at him in horror, Lu Tingxiao asked, \"Anything else?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi covered her mouth and shook her head. She stood up straight, turned around, and then sat back down on the sofa.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye held his fists in balls and avoided everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The damaged Lu Jingli covered his chest and pushed Lu Tingxiao over. \"Bro, give me some more space!\"</p><br/><p>There was still some space between Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi. After Lu Jingli pushed, Lu Tingxiao now sat right next to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\"Ha...haha...Mr. Lu is pretty considerate!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ning Xi made it!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone started talking again and the atmosphere became more relaxed.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there were people whispering around as well\u2026</p><br/><p>\"What was Lu Tingxiao trying to do?\"</p><br/><p>\"What could he be trying? He's just trying to play nice, he\u2019s a man after all! Isn\u2019t it normal?\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s normal for men, but this is Lu Tingxiao we\u2019re talking about. What happened was too shocking!\"</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s wrong with Lu Tingxiao? He\u2019s a man as well! With a beauty like Ning Xi, there aren't many men that can restrain themselves. Take a guess, if Ning Xueluo was not around just now, would Su Yan have let this chance slip away?\"</p><br/><p>\"Well...it\u2019s pretty hard to say\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone had thoughts of their own, but Ning Xi just sat there obediently. As she was being all quiet and shy, she suddenly felt a warm hand on her thigh! Ning Xi\u2019s back straightened, then she glared at Lu Tingxiao and stopped his hand with hers.</p><br/><p>What are you doing?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao held his chin with one hand and sat there with his usual cool attitude, but under the table, he was holding her hand and not letting go.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi tried to take her hand back but failed, so she just let him do what he wanted, her heart racing quickly.</p><br/><p>What was this? It felt like a secret lover\u2019s meeting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You\u2019re the child of your mother and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the little guy sparkled when he received an affirmative answer from his father. \u201cI knew it! Since the first time I saw Mommy, I knew Mommy was really my mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi teared a little as she looked at the adorable little bun. She gave him a big hug. \u201cBaby, quickly pinch me and tell me that I\u2019m not dreaming! How could I have given birth to such a cute and smart child that\u2019s loved by everyone!? I\u2019m so amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun did not pinch Ning Xi. Instead, he just kissed Ning Xi on her cheek. \u201cI think I might be dreaming too. The mother who\u2019s as sparkling as a princess and as beautiful as roses is actually my mother! I\u2019m really happy! I\u2019m amazing too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao grinned as he looked at the mother-son pair, then he smiled with a gentle expression.</p><br/><p>As for Lu Jingli at the corner\u2026</p><br/><p>He felt horrible. <em>Damn! That was really enough! Did you guys have to say it out loud?</em></p><br/><p>He was so worried that he was fully prepared for an emergency rescue, yet this had happened\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, there were two more fires back at home waiting for his rescue. He had better go and report the good news now!</p><br/><p>Late at night in the bedroom.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sang and put the little bun to sleep. The little guy grabbed onto her shirt and was not letting go.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi kissed his forehead. \u201cGo to sleep. Mommy will stay by your side. Good night.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little guy mumbled, \u201cMmm, goodnight, Mommy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bun rubbed his eyes and turned over to look at Lu Tingxiao. Then, he mumbled again, \u201cGoodnight\u2026 Father\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was stunned when he heard Little Treasure call him \u201cFather\u201d. He did not seem to expect it.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her eyebrows and laughed when she saw Lu Tingxiao\u2019s awkward reaction. \u201cDarling, don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s the first time Little Treasure has called you \u2018Father\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was speechless.</p><br/><p>That was the first time indeed!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could not stop laughing. \u201cReally? The first time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Yes, he was in such a terrible state.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held her laughter in and kissed Lu Tingxiao. \u201cGet over it. I\u2019m sure Little Treasure will start calling you \u2018Father\u2019 from now onwards!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao kissed her back. \u201cMmm, thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked as she looked at the man beside her. She suddenly said, \u201cLu Tingxiao, let\u2019s go public about us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was a little taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I mean exactly that. Let\u2019s tell everyone about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao seemed nervous. \u201cAre things alright on your end?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi analyzed, \u201cMy fans are pretty stable now and I can start changing my style soon. Announcing my marriage now wouldn\u2019t have too much of an effect on me, and it\u2019ll help in my change of style too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi grinned and kissed her darling\u2019s cheek. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll start preparing now. Without any issues, we can plan it after I\u2019ve signed the movie contract with Chen Mian!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the title.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Lu Tingxiao followed up to say, \u201cAs for getting pregnant before marriage, there was indeed such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard this, the crowd was dumbfounded. Even Xu Tao was worried. He subconsciously wanted to rush over to stop him, yet he was pulled back by Liang Feixing, who quickly muttered something into his ear.</p><br/><p>Then, Xu Tao became confused. \u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the fans and media who did not know the truth were still completely puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Ning Xi has really gotten pregnant before marriage before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would Lu Tingxiao even expose such a thing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe clearly knew that Ning Xi had gotten pregnant before marriage and still he\u2019s staying with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes swept the crowd. Instantly, it was as if someone had pressed on the \u201ckeep quiet\u201d switch for everyone amd the crowd returned to its pin-drop silence.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao said, \u201cBut the person at fault in this matter is me, back then, Xiao Xi hadn\u2019t entered the entertainment industry either, so there shouldn\u2019t be anything that she needs to explain to everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn! The person at fault was Lu Tingxiao. What did that mean?</p><br/><p>Could it be what they thought?</p><br/><p>Could it be that the legendary little prince of the Lu family was\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao continued, \u201cNing Xi is my son\u2019s biological mother.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>The child inside Xiao Xi, is mine.</em></p><br/><p><em>Ning Xi and I have registered for two years, six months, and 17 days.</em></p><br/><p><em>Ning Xi is my son\u2019s biological mother.</em></p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had just appeared for a few minutes and yet with just a few short sentences, he had shocked the entire entertainment industry, and all of China\u2019s citizens, then he left the stunned crowd and carried his wife home\u2026</p><br/><p>Inside the car.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was still in Lu Tingxiao\u2019s arms in the backseat.</p><br/><p>Ever since the latter had gotten into the car, he did not say a word and he seemed extremely unhappy.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at her fingers and admitted to her wrongdoings., \u201cMmm, Darling, sorry\u2026 Actually, I wanted to give you a surprise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was speechless.</p><br/><p>Yeah! He was surprised enough! His entire soul almost left him from being frightened by her!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was about to speak again when she felt the urge to puke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrive slower!\u201d Lu Tingxiao frowned.</p><br/><p>Cheng Feng, who was driving up front, was speechless.</p><br/><p><em>I am already driving the Maybach like an electromobile, Boss\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>Forget it, he will take the challenge and go for a bicycle\u2019s speed\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao patted the girl\u2019s back lightly, seeming like he was about to go into battle. \u201cGo to the hospita!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly waved her hand. \u201cAhhh, no need. This is just the normal reaction of vomiting during pregnancy. If I have to go to the hospital for this, then wouldn\u2019t I need to stay in the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao replied, \u201cYou can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, okay? Darling\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao took a deep breath but he still could not calm down.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the man\u2019s tensed up expression from being overly nervous and said helplessly, \u201cWe\u2019ve already had Little Treasure before. This isn\u2019t our first one. Why are you still so tensed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just tensed?</p><br/><p>When he had heard the news of her pregnancy from someone else, he wished he could put on wings and fly to her side.</p><br/><p>The sound of an urgent ringtone rang and Lu Tingxiao picked the phone up. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. She\u2019s beside me and we\u2019re on the way home. Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall from home?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the old residence first. Father and Mother knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Ning Xi did not know why but she had a bad feeling about this\u2026</p><br/><p>When they reached the Lu family\u2019s old residence.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi got down the car and was dumbstruck when she reached the entrance. She almost could not recognize the place.</p><br/><p>From the yard outside all the way to the door, the floor was covered by a thick layer of soft rug. The door\u2019s hard frame and the walls were all wrapped with a layer of pad. Not too far away on the pebble path, Little Treasure was directing for a few robots to take out the pebbles one by one, and then covered it again with soil\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gulped. She turned to Lu Tingxiao and said, \u201cDarling, sorry, I accused you wrongly earlier.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

She could not understand what the producer was thinking!</p><br/><p>For a Hollywood movie, especially a remake of a classic movie like \u201cAssassin\u201d, why would they use a Chinese female star?</p><br/><p>However, even Director Simon was wary as he reminded Lilian with an unusual tone not to cause any trouble.</p><br/><p>While she was displeased, she did not do anything about it.</p><br/><p>Of course, if they did not reach the expected box office numbers when the movie was released, they could just blame everything on the female lead.</p><br/><p>At this moment, all the members of the media were so shocked that they forgot about asking questions.</p><br/><p>A Hollywood movie had decided to use a Chinese actress as the female lead, and it was Ning Xi of all people\u2026</p><br/><p>Every camera was aimed at Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Ms. Ning Xi, are you taking up the role of the female lead, Anna?\u201d A reporter asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ning Xi nodded and replied.</p><br/><p>Some people were still in doubt, but as soon as Ning Xi admitted it, she caused a huge ruckus in the venue.</p><br/><p>Zhen Anru, Han Zixuan, and the few assistants were looking at Ning Xi as their minds went blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi is\u2026 the female lead? Im-impossible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the assistants lost the shine in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru came back to her senses and there was a big shift in her expression.</p><br/><p>It was already a rare chance for a top star in China to play a minor role in the movie \u201cAssassin\u201d. Now, to become the female lead\u2026</p><br/><p>Was this some kind of international joke?</p><br/><p>\u201cZheng Anru, resting down here with your minor character? Don\u2019t you want to have a seat up there?\u201d Xu Tao went up to her and smiled.</p><br/><p>Zheng Anru clenched her fists tightly as her expression darkened. She could never have anticipated this.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi as the female lead of a huge Hollywood movie? What kind of concept was this?!</p><br/><p>Xu Tao grinned cheekily. Ning Xi would become an international star after her appearance in the \u201cAssassin\u201d as the female lead!</p><br/><p>From then on, who else in the Chinese entertainment industry could compare to Ning Xi?</p><br/><p>Han Zixuan? She was no different from trash!</p><br/><p>Except if Han Zixuan could outperform herself in \u201cAssassin\u201d.</p><br/><p>But as a mere minor character, was it possible?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get so cocky, Xu Tao!\u201d Zheng Anru burst with rage as she saw Xu Tao\u2019s cheeky smile.</p><br/><p>She thought that Han Zixuan\u2019s position in the entertainment industry would be enhanced after they announced her involvement in the movie, but God knows what happened to the production team of \u201cAssassin\u201d to make them decide on the female lead to be Ning Xi!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I\u2019m being cocky? Bite me! I\u2019m worried that you teeth might fall off though!\u201d Xu Tao chuckled.</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was really enjoying himself when he saw Zheng Anru\u2019s frustrated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you being so happy about?\u201d Zheng Anru pointed her finger at Xu Tao furiously. \u201cWho knows if your outdated artiste will get changed halfway through. Even if she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll see how you\u2019re going to deal with it if the movie doesn\u2019t reach the expected box office figures!\u201d Zheng Anru\u2019s voice trembled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

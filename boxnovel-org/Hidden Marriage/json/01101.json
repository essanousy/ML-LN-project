But not anymore!</p><br/><p>He really had to speed up his game to get closer to Ziyao\u2026</p><br/><p>As he was about to go and look for Guan Ziyao, a guy suddenly dragged him aside and asked excitedly, \"Master Mok, is that girl in the corner your friend? What\u2019s her name? Where's she from?\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you want?\" Mo Lingtian glanced at him suspiciously.</p><br/><p>This guy was an infamous Casanova in Imperial and changed girlfriends as often as he changed his clothes. Worst of all, he loved to mess with other people\u2019s girlfriends.</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe raised his eyebrows. \"Of course, I\u2019m interested! You know I like that type of chick!\"</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian sipped some wine to contain his annoyance. \"You don\u2019t have to know who she is. All I'll say is don\u2019t mess with trouble.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe exclaimed, \"Hey, don\u2019t jinx me! It\u2019s normal for a guy to be attracted to such a beautiful lady!\"</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian said without any expression, \"She\u2019s taken.\"</p><br/><p>\"So what? There\u2019s no girl in Imperial that I wouldn't dare to flirt with!\" Wang Shengzhe then courageously walked towards Ning Xi\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Somewhere nearby, Guan Ziyao was talking to Lu Tingxiao. She wore a black Chanel gown in her usual simple and elegant style, but her expression looked tired.</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao looked at the man in front of her and spoke slowly, \"Tingxiao, I\u2019m sorry for what happened last time. I lost control of my emotions. I should\u2019ve said something before I left.</p><br/><p>\"I understand what you\u2019re trying to say. You\u2019re the most compatible man I\u2019ve ever met and I once thought that we could spend the rest of our lives together. But there is still a long way to go and too many things are simply unpredictable... It\u2019s regrettable but I respect your decision.\"</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao then smiled with poise. \"So, we\u2019re still friends right?\"</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, this was the best way for her to move forward right now. She had forced herself not to look for him during this period of time. She thought that if she stepped back, Lu Tingxiao would not reject her this time.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao glanced at her, then said with his usual cold expression, \"I\u2019m sorry, to avoid any further misunderstandings with my girlfriend, we really shouldn\u2019t contact each other anymore.\"</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao\u2019s face froze. She did not expect Lu Tingxiao\u2019s reply. His words had completely disregarded her!</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao looked hurt and her voice trembled, \"Tingxiao...we\u2019ve known each other for about 20 years, I understand that you have someone you love, but I already declared that I will leave you. Are you going to give up our friendship for a woman you haven't known for very long?\"</p><br/><p>\"She\u2019s not just a woman I haven't known for long. She\u2019s my future wife.\" Lu Tingxiao then coldly looked at her with a warning glare and Guan Ziyao felt a chill run down her spine\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

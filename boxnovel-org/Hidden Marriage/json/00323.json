I hope that you can reconsider your decision!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye could not stand it anymore, and faked a laugh, \"Haha, Miss Su, you\u2019re a bit too controlling, aren\u2019t you? And next time please call me Jiang Mu Ye, not Xiao Ye!\"</p><br/><p>Su Yimo did not look very happy, \"Xiao Ye, I know you don\u2019t like people controlling you, but it's for your own good.\"</p><br/><p>Seeing how awkward the atmosphere was getting, Zhao Meixin spoke up, \"Yimo is the person to go to regarding endorsements! She has just sealed herself the main endorsement of Chanel in the central region, and the Lu corporation is looking to continue her contract as well\u2026 Ah, she\u2019s been real busy!\"</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ye, I\u2019ve been through this before and I think you really should listen to me. I\u2019ll take my leave first for now, talk to you again sometime.\"</p><br/><p>She continued to ignore Ning Xi as she just nodded coldly at Jiang Muye and left.</p><br/><p>Once they left, Jiang Muye exploded on the spot, \"What the heck! Who\u2019s Xiao Ye?! Xiao Ye is not for her to use! She's even daring enough to meddle with my business! She really thinks that she\u2019s my aunt now! If it weren't for her saving Little Treasure before, I'd have fallen out with her already! Ning Xiao Xi, go and bite her to death!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless, \"Can you please not make it sound like I\u2019m a dog?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye started prattling on, \"Ning Xi, you don't know the least of it. Uncle has never mentioned to Su Yimo that she saved Little Treasure. He just casually ordered people to give her a boost in her career.</p><br/><p>\"She just thought so highly of herself, always assuming that my uncle was head over heels for her and hence backed her up. She almost self-declared herself as Mrs. Lu! The tone that she uses to talk to me every time is disgusting!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the direction Su Yimo walked towards, \"As long as she didn\u2019t do any harm to me, I won\u2019t do anything either. But seeing her attitude, it\u2019s near impossible to keep peace with her, and we are bound to clash heads one day.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye quickly replied, \"Don\u2019t back down! Fight for it! I\u2019m your strongest backup shield! I\u2019d rather you become my aunt than her!\"</p><br/><p>\"...Thanks?\"\"</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Zhao Meixin carefully took out an exquisite gift from the back seat, \"Yimo, this was sent by Ning Xueluo\u2019s manager this morning. Ning Xueluo is against Ning Xi now because of that incident previously. Now that they are suddenly trying to get on our good side, I suppose they probably want to collaborate.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The problem that you are worried about definitely won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she saw Zheng Minjun and Su Hongguang\u2019s attitude, Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s expression softened.</p><br/><p>After all, the main culprit of this incident was still Ning Xi, that damned brat!</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu sighed, \u201cWe can obviously see how you and Su Yan have been treating our Xueluo, but now that the matter has reached this stage, how\u2019s our Xueluo supposed to face everyone from now on? How can she still establish herself in this circle from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang quickly assured, \u201cThat isn\u2019t a problem. Even if Ning Xi and Su Yan had started dating first, it was still something that happened before they got married. Xueluo and Su Yan have already been married for so long, and they even have a child now. As long as Su Yan and Xueluo still love each other, everyone will only talk about this for a few days at the most. Later on, I will chat with Su Yan and tell him to make a statement. I\u2019ll definitely handle this matter well. Please don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu and Ning Yaohua nodded, satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Before Su Yan entered the ward to see Ning Xueluo, Su Hongguang called him aside to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang looked at his son and sighed, \u201cSu Yan, this matter is can be quite grave. You must know that as an heir of a family clan, marriage is extremely important to your image.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Su Yan nodded with fatigue.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, everyone already knows about Xueluo being pregnant. Even if it was exposed that back then it was Ning Xi who dated you first, but to divorce Xueluo right now\u2026 abandoning a pregnant woman, if word gets out, it will definitely affect our Su family\u2019s reputation significantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, on Xueluo\u2019s side, we must calm her down first. As for Ning Xi, to avoid arousing suspicion, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t get too close,\u201d reprimanded Su Hongguang with a stern tone.</p><br/><p>Clearly, now was definitely not the best time for a divorce.</p><br/><p>When Su Yan heard his father, his pupils shrunk slightly. Initially, Xueluo\u2019s pregnancy had already made him ashamed to face her. This time, because of him, Ning Xi was almost pushed off the edge. How could he be not in the least concerned?</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang patted his son\u2019s shoulder and consoled him with a hint, \u201cSu Yan, I understand how you feel. Those who do big things must understand how to exercise patience. Now, everything must wait until Xueluo safely gives birth to the child. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan took a deep breath as he suppressed the emotions in his heart and said, \u201cFather, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the ward.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s eyes were red as she leaned back on the bedhead, looking absent-minded.</p><br/><p>When she heard the familiar sounds of footstep from the entrance, Ning Xueluo slowly turned to look over. The instant she saw the man, the tears that she had kept in for a long time suddenly fell at once. \u201cBro Yan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he looked at this girl who was carrying his baby, Su Yan avoided her gaze like a sorry figure. He was silent for a long time, but he finally mustered the strength to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>She heard Su Yan\u2019s apology and how he did not defend himself at all, just admitting to everything.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo tightened her fists that were under her blanket. She disguised the malevolence in her eyes and her expression became even more miserable. She forced a laugh and said, \u201cActually, I knew\u2026 I should\u2019ve known. Sister is so beautiful, so excellent. No matter what, I chase I can\u2019t catch up to her. There will be a day when you will return to her side\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether it was in the past or right now, I\u2019ve never thought of fighting for anything with Sister. If I could, I would be willing\u2026 willing to matchmake the two of you\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

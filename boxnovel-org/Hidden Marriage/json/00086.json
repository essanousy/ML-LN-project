The title was \u201cThe story of how the scheming bitch Ning Xi got to the top, an unprecedentedly shameless person.\u201d</p><br/><p>The summary of the content was that she had slept with the director to get her role, and had gone around seducing wealthy old men to trick them into giving her gifts. She had even deliberately taken advantage of Jiang Muye while filming\u2026</p><br/><p>The post even said that when she was on set, her room door was always open. Anyone who wanted to sleep with her could walk right in and sleep with her. It made her sound like a total whore who was extremely easy and completely lacked any moral boundaries.</p><br/><p>This made Jiang Muye\u2019s fans explode. They banded up to protest that their idol had been paired up with a woman like that and angrily demanded that the production crew change the second female lead.</p><br/><p>The comments on Ning Xi\u2019s most recent post were simply unbearable to look at. It was completely filled with angry curses. Everyone was yelling, \u201cNing Xi, get out from the entertainment industry!\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen it clearly now? Post a statement of apology to redeem the company\u2019s image right now!\u201d Chang Li angrily spat out an order.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sneered, \u201cA statement of apology?\u201d</p><br/><p>Normally, when actors who were signed to a company encountered a situation like this, the company would organise a special public relations team to emphasise the actors\u2019 innocence and perform damage control. Chang Li on the other hand\u2026</p><br/><p>As if Chang Li really wanted her to redeem the company\u2019s image. Chang Li was only trying to thoroughly discredit her. Apologising would make it seem like she was admitting to everything that was written in that blog.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I had better see it before 8pm tonight. It would be best if it was a video since that looks more sincere! Otherwise, just wait till you\u2019re kicked out of the cast! When the time comes, even the company won\u2019t be able to protect you!\u201d After Chang Li issued this threat, she ruthlessly hung up the phone with a smack.</p><br/><p>After this call, Ning Xi was wide awake.</p><br/><p>She had anticipated a situation like this long ago, but she hadn\u2019t expected that the other party would act this quickly.</p><br/><p>It looked like Jia Qingqing couldn\u2019t even wait another second. With Ning Xueluo adding fuel to the flame, she had been thrown into a raging storm over the course of a single night.</p><br/><p>Very well. Bring it on!</p><br/><p>She had actually been worried that they wouldn\u2019t make a move!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately got out of bed and washed up. Afterwards, she took out her cosmetic products and began to apply her makeup.</p><br/><p>After half an hour, she looked at her face in the mirror. After putting on makeup, she had become haggard and pale, yet sweetly pitiful. She nodded her head in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Right after she cleaned up the table, there was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stood up to open the door. Afterwards, she stared blankly. It was yesterday\u2019s \u2018pervert\u2019, Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>After the events of last night, she actually felt a little weird looking at him now\u2026</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Ning Xi to speak, Lu Tingxiao saw her incomparably pale and haggard complexion and his expression immediately became incomparably ice-cold. Without another word, he picked up his phone and started to search for a contact.</p><br/><p>Out of the corner of her eyes, Ning Xi saw his finger stop at the name Liang Feixing.</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing was the director of public relations at Golden Age Entertainment. He had a pair of magic hands that had beautifully resolved the scandals of many actors and restored their reputations. He could be considered a model example for any public relations manager.</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi saw this, she immediately reacted. Like a tiger, she lunged forward and snatched Lu Tingxiao\u2019s phone. \u201cLu Tingxiao, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSettling the matter.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s complexion was extremely ugly, making it obvious that he had also found about the matter on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Ning Xi helplessly looked at her opponent, Big Boss, who wanted to help her cheat her way out without saying a single word.</p><br/><p>The last time, when Lu Tingxiao had acted without a word and ordered Su Yimo\u2019s personal stylist to help her out, she had already been shocked enough. At least no one had found out. If he did something like that again, she really wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it.</p><br/><p>If Golden Age Entertainment suddenly intervened under these crazy circumstances, she was going to get another label of being a traitor who was two-timing on the two companies.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This old European guy before the had once shocked the underground powers of Europe and America. When he was younger, he had been an extremely prestigious surgeon.</p><br/><p>Later on in his life, he had used his surgical blade to cut off his daughter and wife\u2019s heads. He was a complete madman!</p><br/><p>From then on, he became an assassin, and the outside world had christened him the title of \u201cDoctor Death\u201d.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang trembled on the inside. Since this old guy was \u201cDoctor Death\u201d, then the black man beside him should be his partner, number seven on the Original Sin assassin rankings, \u201cBacteriophobic Ripper\u201d Yorick.</p><br/><p>To be able to send two people from the Origin Sin\u2019s top ten on an assassination in China could only be the work of the forces from European King.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe both of you, do you have any more last words? If you don\u2019t, then we can begin,\u201d Doctor Death smiled and said.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Tang Lang\u2019s eyes widened and he shouted, \u201cGrandfather! Someone\u2019s not giving you face. Bloody hell, they\u2019ve come to challenge you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Very quickly, with one hand holding a drumstick and a greasy mouth while wearing Ning Xi\u2019s slippers on his feet, Han Xiao ran to the door as he ate.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld guy, if you have the guts, don\u2019t run. My grandfather is coming. Just wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Lang saw the man in slippers going over, the solemn expression on his face finally dissipated. He started to chew on the remaining watermelon in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao walked to Ning Xi\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis black guy and this old fart!\u201d Tang Lang chomped on his watermelon as he pointed at \u201cDoctor Death\u201d and \u201cBacteriophobic Ripper\u201d Yorick.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao snatched a piece of watermelon from Tang Lang and asked as he ate.</p><br/><p>When she saw Tang Lang and Han Xiao eating melons like spectators, Ning Xi was completely floored.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell! These were Original Sin\u2019s top ten assassins. Could they give people some dignity?! Just a bit of dignity!</p><br/><p>When he saw Han Xiao appear, the perverted madness in the European elder\u2019s eyes instantly faded away.</p><br/><p>Especially Yorick, who quickly put his submachine gun away. His initially grave and stern face suddenly had a flattering smile, \u201cOh, Master Xiao! How come it\u2019s you, Senior?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yorick\u2019s forehead broke out into a cold sweat.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 Were the higher-ups playing an international joke?!</p><br/><p>No one had told them that the madman Han Xiao was here!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Han Xiao ate his melon and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Xiao, look at your memory\u2026 I\u2019m Yorick\u2026\u201d Yorick quickly smiled obsequiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao thought about it for a while, but his memory failed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time, I didn\u2019t know and offended you, but you were merciful. You broke one of my legs. After that, it was fixed by a friend.\u201d Yorick looked nervously at the European elder beside him.</p><br/><p>About two years ago, he and \u201cDoctor Death\u201d had received an assassination mission. On the way, they had met Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>In the end, they had almost been beaten to death by Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>Yorick had had one of his legs broken, and later on it had been fixed by \u201cDoctor Death\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pointing at me with the surgical blade, so what are you implying?\u201d Han Xiao looked at the European elder.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 I\u2026\u201d The European elder\u2019s body wavered, then he quickly swept the surgical blade across his chin. \u201cMaster Xiao, don\u2019t misunderstand. I\u2019m just shaving\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I think he\u2019s even better than Tingxiao when he was young. The younger generations are getting better and better!\" a close guest of the families commented.</p><br/><p>As the host, Lu Chongshan went along with the crowd and praised Guan Rui since they were going to become a family soon, but he chuckled to himself when he heard that comment.</p><br/><p>Better than Lu Tingxiao when he was little? That was some big talk!</p><br/><p>Lu Chongshan did not show his emotions on the surface nonetheless. \"Of course, he\u2019s better than Tingxiao!\"</p><br/><p>Guan Rui waved his hands in denial. \"You guys have to stop praising him, he\u2019s going to become full of himself. He could never be up to Tingxiao\u2019s standard! I would be really glad if he could be at least half capable as his Uncle Xiao!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re too humble, Elder Lu, he\u2019s going to do something great! For families like ours, the most important thing isn\u2019t the money we earn or the properties we own, it\u2019s the people. As long as our successors are capable, that\u2019s the real treasure of the family. No matter how great your family is, with an incapable successor, it will surely fall in a few generations!\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right! Elder Guan is really blessed! Ziyao, Zihao, and Zhichen are all superb!\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly, unlike us, still having to worry about the useless kids at home\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Many people were able to relate to their words, at the same time, suddenly remembering the worrying situation of the heir to the Lu family.</p><br/><p>So what if they were the richest family in Imperial?</p><br/><p>No matter how great Lu Tingxiao was, he could, at most, hang on for one or maybe two generations. Numerous shareholders and supporters had their eyes on the family. If there was no capable successor after Lu Tingxiao, things might be chaotic and the Lu dynasty might even fall within a night; it was not an uncommon sight in cases like these. No one could predict what would happen in the future\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Somewhere in the banquet hall, Ning Xi noticed a group of people flattering the Guan family, and she knew her chance had arrived\u2026</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian and a few other guys had been defeated by Guan Zhichen\u2019s mathematics question and were even humiliated by their own parents, making them all feel very embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian could not help it anymore, so he spoke up helplessly, \"Zhichen, we\u2019re all underachievers here. Even if we learned about it before, it\u2019s been so long ago that we\u2019ve all forgotten about it. Why not you ask your aunt? Surely she could solve them!\"</p><br/><p>Guan Zhichen looked at Guan Ziyao and mumbled, \"She explained it to me before but I didn\u2019t get it, then she got angry at me and was unwilling to teach me again!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ugh, well\u2026\" Mo Lingtian shrugged cluelessly but he then suddenly thought of something. \"I know! Uncle Xiao will surely know this! Eh...where\u2019s Lu Tingxiao?\"</p><br/><p>Guan Ziyao stared at Mo Lingtian unhappily., \"Tingxiao is busy, don\u2019t pester him, it\u2019s Zhichen\u2019s fault for not being able to solve this, let him think on his own.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ziyao, you\u2019re too strict! Zhichen is only 13!\" Mo Lingtian replied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

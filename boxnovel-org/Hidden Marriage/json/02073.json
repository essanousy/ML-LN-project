The shareholders who questioned Ning Xueluo\u2019s identity would have nothing to say this time, and he even planned to use this child to get closer to the Zhuang family.</p><br/><p>However, now everything was done for!</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua almost went berserk when he heard the news!</p><br/><p>With such a big incident as the Madam\u2019s child gone, the two maids quivered. They were too scared to say anything.</p><br/><p>President Ning and Madam had been very concerned about this child. They were going to be dead!</p><br/><p>The chauffeur\u2019s expression was as pale as a sheet. He still had blood stains on his hands and body. He started mumbling after being kicked by Ning Yaohua. \u201cPresident Ning\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 I really don\u2019t know how it turned out like this\u2026 We were already preparing to go back home, then suddenly a bike rushed towards us and hit Madam!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! There were so many people around! Was the biker blind?\u201d Ning Yaohua was enraged.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo then said angrily, \u201cWith so many of you around, yet you all couldn\u2019t protect Mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo sounded like it was their negligence that had caused this incident as she blamed it all onto them.</p><br/><p>The chauffeur quickly denied, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that! It\u2019s not our problem! It\u2019s that biker. He just rushed towards us! I already dragged Madam aside to avoid it, but that person changed directions on purpose and then went straight towards Madam!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn purpose? What do you mean?\u201d Ning Xueluo frowned.</p><br/><p>The two maids calmed down, they then spoke up too, \u201cI think that guy did it on purpose! All of us stood nearby each other, and of all people, he rushed towards Madam\u2019s direction!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other maid also explained, \u201cThe person moved too fast for us to react. There wasn\u2019t even time for us to shield Madam! That person seemed to aim specifically at Madam\u2019s stomach!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo turned to Ning Yaohua. \u201cThis\u2026 Could it have been planned?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver\u2019s tone was much more confident now. \u201cIt must be. If it had been a robbery then he would\u2019ve taken bags, but he didn\u2019t do anything else! And his initial target was Madam! If not, he wouldn\u2019t have changed directions and gone straight for Madam even after I dragged her away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu was crying hysterically, \u201cMy child\u2026 Why? Who? Why do this to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho dares to make a move on us Nings?!\u201d Ning Yaohua roared.</p><br/><p>Zheng Minjun tried to butt in as she put up an angry front. \u201cIt even happened under broad daylight! How dare they!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan calmly analyzed, \u201cAccording to their description, it doesn\u2019t seem to be just an accident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Hongguang looked at Ning Yaohua and asked, \u201cYaohua, did you make enemies with anyone recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua gave it some thought, but he rejected it quickly, \u201cImpossible! Everything is going smoothly in the company!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if there were some arguments over the business, with Ning International\u2019s current scale and their relationship with the Su family, no one would be bold enough to make a move on people from the Ning family.</p></div>\n</div>"}

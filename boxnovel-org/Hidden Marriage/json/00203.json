Ning Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi got up in front of all the media and cameras, bowed, then sat down.</p><br/><p>Photographers started shooting in a burst of flashes, one after the other.</p><br/><p>Today Ning Xi was wearing a black dress along with a sedate makeup look, suitable for such a formal occasion.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli then added: \u201cNext, for the majority of people more concerned about the problems of Leng Manyun, Miss Lin Zhizhi is here to answer your questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>If placed before them at any other time, the topic of Leng Manyun would definitely become the focus of attention. However now, the reporters wanted it to end quickly so they could move onto the main topic of conversation\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Lin Zhizhi\u2019s style had always been short and sweet. With just a few words, she succinctly announced the news of Leng Manyun\u2019s marriage as well as her future work arrangements; where she would only be focusing on her family.</p><br/><p>Her words assured everyone\u2019s speculation that Ning Xi was indeed joining Golden Age Entertainment and was going to be raised as Leng Manyun\u2019s successor.</p><br/><p>At this time, one of the reporters asked: \u201cWe would like to know why you decided to not only sign in, such a corrupt artist, but plan on letting her take over the position of Leng Manyun! Are you not afraid of self destruction?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other journalists also echoed the statement:</p><br/><p>\u201cSelf destructive signs are good. It shows the whole company is bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI doubt that the high level executives are in support of this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Age Entertainment can\u2019t tell in the end what is good anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli gave Chen Jing a look, \u201cThe next to speak is lawyer Chen, please keep quiet.</p><br/><p>Lawyer Chen?</p><br/><p>Just now, they were also surprised as to why there was a lawyer at a press conference. Everyone turned to look curiously at him.</p><br/><p>They saw Chen Jing click on the computer in front of him, and everyone heard the sound of the scene from a speaker \u2013</p><br/><p>[Not Ning Xi! It\u2019s not Ning Xi who bribed me! The one who gave me money to modify the sword was someone else! But I don\u2019t know who the other person is! I received an anonymous email. The other party in the email told me what to do, then directly deposited a hundred thousand now and another hundred thousand upon completion!]</p><br/><p>The sound stopped, the room was quiet for three seconds, then audience were in an uproar.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli glanced out with a chilling look, \u201cPlease be quiet.\u201d The reporters immediately quieted, staring shocked.</p><br/><p>Then the big screen behind Chen Jing lit up, showing two pictures. One was a picture showing the anonymous e-mail IP address was actually at Ning Xuelo address at Pearl River Apartments. The other showed that the anonymous account was actually from Ning Xuelo\u2019s assistant, Cui Caijing.</p><br/><p>This time, another uproar happened that could no longer be suppressed. However,</p><br/><p>Lawyer Chen wasn\u2019t finished yet. He released the extent of Ning Xuelo\u2019s injury and doctor\u2019s diagnosis report proving that Ning Xi had immediately withdrawn when she hit Ning Xuelo causing her injury to be very light. It was in the category of skin trauma, she could have been released that very day.</p><br/><p>However, Ning Xuelo decided to stay in the hospital for several days. And each time she was in front of the reporters, she would claim it was a serious injury and she was weak due to massive blood loss, deliberately trying to gain sympathy.</p><br/><p>After the release of the evidence, Chen Jing produced a lawyer\u2019s letter expressing that Ning Xi was filing a formal claim against Ning Xuelo for being framed, defamation, and libel.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Let her cause more trouble. That way, it\u2019ll be more fun when the time comes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare a contract for Ning Xi.\u201d Lu Tingxiao instructed.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Lu Jingli\u2019s eyes immediately lit up, \u201cA contract? Bro, you\u2019re finally preparing to bring Sister-in-law into Golden Age?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare a set of the profiles of all the managers in Golden Age for me too.\u201d His words could be counted as an indirect reply to Lu Jingli\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, I got it! You\u2019re going to pick a manager for Xiao Xixi personally? Geez, if you gave me 0.001% of the same treatment you give to Xiao Xixi, I\u2019d be pretty satisfied!\u201d Lu Jingli complained in a sour tone.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Lu Tingxiao cast a sideways glance at him and suddenly reached towards him with one hand.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli thought he was going to beat him and subconsciously retreated backwards to duck his hand, \u201cWhat did I say wrongly this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Lu Tingxiao simply reached out to pat the back of his neck.</p><br/><p>A gesture that was extremely intimate coming from his brother.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was overwhelmed by the unexpected favour and was about to ascend into heaven, even his ears had turned a little red, \u201cBro, what\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao frowned as he looked at him, but his tone was very gentle, \u201cDon\u2019t just think about playing all day, work hard and find someone you like to spend the rest of your days with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had a stunned expression on for a moment before his body shuddered harshly, \u201cOh my god! You\u2019re scaring me! Bro, getting such warm treatment from you suddenly is even scarier than when you beat me up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMarriage is important. I\u2019ll take care of it for you when we get back.\u201d Lu Tingxiao spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cOH! Please don\u2019t ! Bro, just let me continue roaming freely! Please let me go free! I won\u2019t poke at you anymore! Please continue being your usual cold self!\u201d Lu Jingli almost peed his pants in fright.</p><br/><p>What if his brother picked a woman as scary as he was?</p><br/><p>What if he picked a woman like Xiao Xixi? He definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to handle her!</p><br/><p>His tastes aren\u2019t that extreme! He likes gentle women!</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli suddenly grew some wit in the middle of his emergency, \u201cBro, it\u2019s not up to us men to worry about stuff like that! Why don\u2019t you wait until you\u2019ve settled down with Sister-in-law and then let Sister-in-law introduce someone to me? My sister-in-law surely has great insight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pondered it for a moment after hearing the suggestion, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli patted his chest and heaved a sigh of relief, that was a narrow escape.</p><br/><p>He had gone through girlfriends pretty quickly in the past, but now it was already close to half a year that he had remained single.</p><br/><p>For some reason, he had started to feel that there was no meaning to dating. Presently, he really didn\u2019t want to start dating again at all.</p><br/><p>Especially after seeing his brother with Ning Xi, it made him feel like the \u2018love\u2019 he had had in the past was meaningless.</p><br/><p>Alright, he admitted it. He was jealous.</p><br/><p>He was jealous that his brother had finally managed to find his true love despite waiting for 32 years. He didn\u2019t know if he would ever find his in his lifetime\u2026</p><br/><p>The more he thought about it, the sadder he got, so he firmly chose not to stay here and continue getting abused by displays of affection, \u201cBro, if there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll take my leave first! I\u2019ll quickly prepare the things you want and send them over! Bye~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the evening of the next day that Ning Xi finally woke up.</p><br/><p>When she opened her eyes again, she felt like her body was floating. Her mind was fuzzy, and it felt like the previous day had happened a lifetime ago.</p><br/><p>When Lu Tingxiao pushed the ward door open, this was the scene that met his eyes.</p><br/><p>Under the glow of the sunset from outside the window, the girl dressed in a loose hospital gown looked like she had just woken up. She sat in obvious confusion on the pure white hospital bed, a dazed expression on her face, drawing sympathy and affection, as well as the overwhelming urge to pull her into his arms\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

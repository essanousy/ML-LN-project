This time, it was several times worse than the incident with Jia Qingqing. After all, Ning Xueluo was much more popular than Jia Qingqing and her fans were more formidable.</p><br/><p>[That bitch Ning Xi has been hiding from the public eye for so long, she\u2019s definitely feeling guilty! She couldn\u2019t possibly have run away after seeing how her plot was exposed, right? After all, she could be charged with attempted murder this time around! If they file a lawsuit, she\u2019s definitely going to jail!]</p><br/><p>[She might have gotten trashed the first time because of someone else\u2019s jealousy, but with incidents like this happening so often, it\u2019s a sure sign that there\u2019s something wrong with her character! Not to mention, she was caught with evidence this time!]</p><br/><p>[Ning Xueluo is famous for being a good person within the entertainment industry. She even repeatedly stood up for Ning Xi as her senior. I really didn\u2019t expect Ning Xi to bite the hand that feeds her and commit such a low crime! It\u2019s all thanks to people like her that the entertainment industry is becoming more corrupt!]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t you guys feel like everything was planned by Ning Xi? First, she got rid of Jia Qingqing to secure her position as the second female lead, and now she\u2019s plotting to bring down Ning Xueluo so that she can take the role of the first female lead!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s extremely frightening once you think about it. She\u2019s too scary! As expected, all beautiful women are bad news!]</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao frowned when he caught sight of the malicious comments on her phone. His brows drew together as he spoke, \u201cStop reading them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sitting cross-legged with a thermometer in her mouth, Ning Xi gave a muffled response, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Reading these is actually pretty fun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFocus on measuring your temperature. Stop speaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d You were the one who started talking to me\u2026</p><br/><p>When the measurement was done, Lu Tingxiao looked at the thermometer, \u201c37.1 degrees.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pleased, Ning Xi immediately said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say that I was fine? In fact, I\u2019m in great health! Can I leave the hospital now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStay a few more days for observation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? I still have to stay?! But I miss Darling Little Treasure!\u201d Ning Xi brought up Little Treasure in a desperate measure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already on the way over.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s tone didn\u2019t allow for any leeway.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, alright then\u2026\u201d Ning Xi was finally speechless.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao put away the dining tray and then sat down on a chair by the bed, \u201cWhat are you planning to do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly recalled something, \u201cI was just about to ask you that. Could you send a copy of the evidence to my phone? I\u2019m going to forward it to someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao shot her a glance, \u201cZhang Qiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Ning Xi was already used to Lu Tingxiao\u2019s killer IQ, she still couldn\u2019t help but feel impressed, \u201cYou deserve to be called Big Boss! You\u2019re too smart! I\u2019m planning to let these two dogs bite each other by making Zhang Qiang extort money from Ning Xueluo with the evidence we found!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi coughed dryly after she finished speaking in excitement. She looked rather uneasily at Lu Tingxiao, \u201cAm I being too\u2026 malicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t respond to her question. Instead, he replied with his analysis, \u201cThe main issue with this method is that there\u2019s nothing in it for you and it lets Zhang Qiang off the hook too easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head, \u201cYou\u2019re right, but my goal is to mess with Ning Xueluo. I didn\u2019t really give much thought to anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>After contemplating for a moment, Lu Tingxiao spoke, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you extort her yourself instead of letting Zhang Qiang reap the benefits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes almost popped out from astonishment upon hearing that, \u201cIs\u2026 Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lu Tingxiao answered her question with one of his own. He immediately continued his analysis, \u201cGoing by Ning Xueluo\u2019s finances, you can probably ask her for about 8 million. This is the best opportunity for you to cancel your contract with Starlight and you can use that money to pay off the penalty fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d After listening to Lu Tingxiao, Ning Xi couldn\u2019t find any words to speak.</p><br/><p>She had only wanted to incite others at most, but this great demon king was really something else. Not only was he looking down on her actions, he actually started teaching her how to be even more evil\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As the live audience and fans on the streaming sites saw the ranking change, they started voting in the male artiste category when Ning Xi reached the top for female artiste ranking. The votes were coming in faster and faster!</p><br/><p>Qin Zhen was skeptical when he saw the ranking.</p><br/><p>The rules were set and Ning Xi had not violated it at all. If he listened to Wang Haojun and brought Ning Xi down when she had so many supporters at the moment, the public would surely spit on them to the point that they would drown!</p><br/><p>Wang Haojun quickly changed his figure with his fingers and raised the price!</p><br/><p>Qin Zhen was taken aback, his eyes full of greed.</p><br/><p>It was such a large amount of money that it would be enough for him to live for the rest of his life even if he quit working after this!</p><br/><p>As Qin Zhen hesitated, he suddenly received a phone call.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, CEO Wang, I have an important phone call. Please wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Zhen\u2019s expression changed when he saw who was calling him. He quickly hid in a corner after he asked Wang Haojun to wait.</p><br/><p>Wang Haojun had an uneasy feeling when he saw Qin Zhen\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>At this time, who could it be?</p><br/><p>In the corner, Qin Zhen picked up the call as he bent over although the person over the phone could not see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, so\u2026 what\u2019s up with the call today, Second Master? I\u2019m surprised! Really surprised!\u201d</p><br/><p>A lazy drawl came over from the other side of the phone, he went straight to the point. \u201cI don\u2019t care how much Wang Haojun offered you, I\u2019m giving you ten times more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn! Ten times more!</p><br/><p>Qin Zhen was almost crushed by this number.</p><br/><p>However, there was no way he could take it!</p><br/><p>It was Lu Jingli himself who had called!</p><br/><p>Darn it, did Lu Jingli not go back to the main company? He had never done anything in the past year after what happened to Glory World Entertainment, so why now?</p><br/><p>He heard a rumor that Glory World had experienced major changes in their management. Could it be that the Lu Corporation was taking over Glory World now?</p><br/><p>Qin Zhen made his decision almost immediately. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re saying, Second Master. CEO Wang didn\u2019t look for me at all! Even if he did, I\u2019d have followed the rules! Don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Zhen lied without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>What a joke! Did he really need time to choose between Starlight and Lu Corporation?</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart man, Producer Qin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou flatter me, Second Master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After he hung up, Qin Zhen wiped the sweat off his forehead as if he had just avoided a major disaster.</p><br/><p>He then went back and rejected Wang Haojun.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO Wang, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help you this time. You can see that everyone\u2019s supporting Ning Xi. Saying that she violated the rules wouldn\u2019t make it!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I really did so, how am I going to face the harsh criticisms and pressure?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, CEO Wang. I can\u2019t help you this time. We\u2019ll stay fair and stick to the rules! If Zixuan can make it on the male artiste ranking, we will treat them fairly\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

You...you...how dare you!\"</p><br/><p>Even Su Yimo who had not bothered to talk to Ning Xi spoke up, \"Ridiculous!\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Meixin was really angry, \"Ning Xi, are you mad? You intentionally said that to humiliate Yimo in public!\"</p><br/><p>Bai Lu was so terrified that she became mute and everyone looked at Ning Xi as if she was a ghost\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Such daring words from Ning Xi\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"She is behaving really oddly today. Is she cursed? Why does she keep on looking for trouble?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s expression did not change at all, regardless of what everyone said, and she put on an innocent face, \"Hmm, I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019ve said wrong, to make Senior Su so angry now\u2026I\u2019ve done my part of the deal, compensated for the damaged clothing, so shouldn't what Senior Su is wearing right now be mine?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><br/><p>Even Su Yimo\u2019s group did not know what to say to her\u2026</p><br/><p>Liang Biqin broke the silence, \"Ning Xi! Are you that poor? You even want this poorly-made clothing too?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put on a troubled expression, scanning Su Yimo\u2019s clothing, \"Ms. Liang\u2019s words are too harsh! Senior Su\u2019s outfit is so precious! How could you say that it\u2019s poorly-made? This is Chanel\u2019s latest exclusive edition dress, which is not even available to the public yet. Even if it was, there are only 10 of them in this world! One's with Senior Su so that means one less in this world! For a garment of this level of exclusivity, even if it was just the bag that it came in, it would be enough to buy every single thing I\u2019m wearing! How can you say that it\u2019s poorly-made?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s memory was superb and she repeated what everyone's praises about the outfit.</p><br/><p>\"You...you\u2026\" Liang Biqin almost choked on herself, \"Don\u2019t you misinterpret my words! I was saying that the dress is damaged! Not that the dress is bad!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded, \"It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s dirty. Sis Meixin mentioned that it can be washed and that the damage was just a little flaw. But since Senior Su can\u2019t stand it, plus my eyesight is pretty poor, I don\u2019t mind at all!\"</p><br/><p>While she was saying that she was blind, everyone knew who the blind one in the situation really was\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi worded it so flawlessly that Su Yimo and the gang could not come back with any reply although they fully understood what she was trying to imply.</p><br/><p>The onlookers were really surprised by how quickly the matter escalated, like a tornado\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly acted nervously and looked at Liang Biqin, \"Ms. Liang, your hands! Stay further away from Senior Su! Please be careful of your manicure. Don\u2019t hook your talons onto my clothes! This outfit is so expensive that I can\u2019t afford it myself!\"</p><br/><p>Some of them started laughing\u2026</p><br/><p>Liang Biqin was very frustrated as Zhao Meixin stood up and spoke harshly, \"Ning Xi, how shameless can you be? You\u2019re such a jerk!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged helplessly, \"Jerks are usually unreasonable...can you tell me which part of me just now sounded unreasonable?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His cup had already been filled and spilt all over the floor.</p><br/><p>He finally understood. No wonder Big Boss Lu had called him in the middle of the night to handle Ning Xi\u2019s things. What exactly was the relationship between Lu Jingli and Ning Xi?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at Lu Jingli, her face caught between a laugh and embarrasment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is too soon, so probably not tonight. I have a little something to do with friends so let us reschedule for another day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the look on Liang Feixing, Lin Zhizhi, and Chen Jing\u2019s face she rushed to explain. \u201cMr. Liang, Sister Lin, Lawyer Chen, let me explain. I once said my cooking is delicious, and he has been clamoring at me to repay him with food instead of going to lunch. But I\u2019m really grateful to everyone today! Thank you!\u201d then she gave a deep bow.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s simple words just solved the ambiguous situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Zhizhi nodded appreciatively. The girl\u2019s sudden crisis handling capacity was quite good. Today\u2019s press conference performance was also quite good. She was indeed a good seedling.</p><br/><p>As for her relationship with Lu Jingli, it was seemingly easy to misunderstand the relationship, but it was clear that the atmosphere between the two was one of good friends.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Pearl River Apartments, Ning Xuelo\u2019s apartment building.</p><br/><p>Su Yan early in the morning bought some medical supplements and came to see her.</p><br/><p>The two got tired of cuddling after a while. Su Yan looked at his watch, then turned on the TV.</p><br/><p>On the screen, the Golden Age Entertainment press conference had just begun. Lu Jingli was introducing Ning Xi as their newest member.</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo after a night without sleep, had her face painted with a few layers of powder that barely covered the dark circles. She got up early to see it live, but did not think that Su Yan would come.</p><br/><p>She wanted to see what would happen in the end, but she knew that she could not watch it with Su Yan!</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo fell into Su Yan\u2019s arms acting spoiled, \u201cYan brother, what is good in watching TV when I\u2019m here. Wouldn\u2019t you rather do something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan patted her hand, his eyes still focused on watching the TV screen:</p><br/><p>\u201cXuelo, don\u2019t make trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan brother, you are so concerned about Ning Xi\u2019s conference?\u201d Ning Xuelo asked unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you care about it? You don\u2019t want to know what they will say at the end of the conference?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dXuelo started choking. \u201cOf course I also care about the conference. But I do not like you looking at her body so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be childish. Be quiet for a while.\u201d Su Yan replied, his expression extremely determined.</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo gritted her teeth bitterly, only able to continue watching the live conference on pins and needles.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Zhizhi made the announcement of Leng Manyun retiring to get married. Then there were reporters asking why Golden Age signed Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo felt her heart in her throat. I thought it best to make trouble.</p><br/><p>But this was Golden Age Entertainment, even the reporters wouldn\u2019t dare cause too much trouble. Complaints would likely be ignored.</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo carefully looked at Su Yan\u2019s reaction, but found that Su Yan\u2019s eyes from beginning to end had not left Ning Xi. Even if the sentence being spoken had nothing to do with Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of crisis.</p><br/><p>At this time, the lawyer clicked the mouse, then came a familiar voice on the TV</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>This\u2026is Zhang Qiang\u2019s voice!</p><br/><p>Ning Xuelo\u2019s could feel her heart beginning to beat faster. She quickly comforted herself. Even if they got Zhang Qiang to give a statement, no one will know that she was the one behind it.</p><br/><p>However, the next thing to develop \u2026 \u2026 step by step, her luck quickly shattered.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

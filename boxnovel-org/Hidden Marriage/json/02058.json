Many of those goddess-level supermodels in the industry were this tall too. In fact, those supermodels with pixie-like features were all flat-chested.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s female outfit did not deliberately fill in anything in the chest area. It was his natural figure. He only did some slimming down and lost some weight. The effect was unexpectedly impressive, brilliantly embodying a beauty that was hard to distinguish between male or female.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Orlando obstructed the door while Ning Xi looked helpless. Jiang Muye\u2019s brows instantly shot up as his arrogant gaze shot a flash of hostility towards Orlando. However, it was only for a split second before he retrieved his gaze. He looked at Ning Xi and said, \u201cThe Director\u2019s calling for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh, oh! I\u2019ll go right away! Senior Orlando, I\u2019ll go to work first. We\u2019ll talk another day!\u201d As if Ning Xi had received a general pardon, she quickly sped off with Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>When they were slightly further away, Jiang Muye warned Ning Xi unhappily, \u201cStay further away from that guy! That\u2019s guy\u2019s infamous in the circle for being a playboy!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi heard him, her mouth instantly twitched as she mumbled, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day I would hear such things from you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, a certain someone had been one of those infamous playboys!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious right now. Did you hear me? This guy likes to provoke Chinese artistes the most! He\u2019s definitely up to no good!\u201d Jiang Muye shot her a look.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded profusely. \u201cI got it, I got it. I\u2019ll be going back in a few more days anyway. I just have to evade him for these next few days!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi then stared at Jiang Muye as she covered her chest and pretended like her heart was racing. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t stare at me like that! You\u2019re too seductive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xiao Xi, f*ck off! I dare you to say that again!\u201d A certain blondie who was being teased instantly exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, my, the way you look when you\u2019re angry is even cuter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xiao Xi! Don\u2019t you dare run!\u201d Jiang Muye was so mad that he chased after her when he suddenly felt a scorching gaze on him, yet when he turned around, he did not see anyone, so he just suspiciously retrieved his gaze.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When everything with the filming crew was wrapped up, Ning Xi packed her stuff and started to walk out.</p><br/><p>She had just reached the carpark when she saw Orlando whom she thought had left. In fact, it seemed like he had been waiting for her for a long time.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was about to break down inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, Senior Orlando, the day after tomorrow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Xi!\u201d Before Ning Xi could speak, Orlando suddenly pulled Ning Xi\u2019s hands and he seemed so elated as if he had managed to get all the girls in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, what\u2019s up?\u201d Ning Xi was a little frightened by Orlando\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarlier, that black rose! Who was that black rose!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Black rose?\u201d</p><br/><p>What the heck!?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one earlier with long, black hair and a black jacket with leather pants!\u201d Orlando explained with waving hands as he described excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 You mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Could Orlando be talking about Jiang Muye?</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, her! Her nose is gorgeous, and her skin is porcelain smooth. Her eyes are especially pretty like they can speak, and her lips are especially suitable for kissing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi watched the way Orlando spoke as it progressed in a weirder direction. Suddenly, she was confused. Why did she feel like\u2026 something was weird?</p><br/><p>As she muttered to herself, she heard Orlando say very excitedly, \u201cXi Xi! I\u2019ve fallen into the river of love again! I\u2019ve fallen in love with the black rose!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>What did she just hear?</p><br/><p>Her ears were probably blinded\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

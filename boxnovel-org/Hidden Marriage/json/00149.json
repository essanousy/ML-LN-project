They\u2019re coming! Lu Tingxiao, hurry up!\u201d Ning Xi had already somehow thrown herself onto him in a mess of motion.</p><br/><p>As expected, once she was stuck onto Lu Tingxiao, the robots didn\u2019t dare to touch her.</p><br/><p>How magical!</p><br/><p>After that warm, soft and fragrant body had just abruptly clung onto him, Lu Tingxiao had a lapse in concentration before he could react. He leaned over to pick her up by the waist, before walking towards the spiral stairs step by step.</p><br/><p>This was probably the first time she had been so close to him while she was sober and awake.</p><br/><p>He really hoped that this walk would never end\u2026</p><br/><p>If Lu Jingli knew what his brother was thinking right now\u2026 Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>The robots followed behind as Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi headed upstairs, maintaining a certain distance between them.</p><br/><p>To keep her balance, Ning Xi\u2019s arms were wrapped around his neck. Breathing in Lu Tingxiao\u2019s chilly yet aromatic scent, looking at the large group of robots following behind as they ascended a set of spiral stairs, she somehow felt that this scene was super romantic!</p><br/><p>However, this rose-coloured bubble didn\u2019t last for long.</p><br/><p>Just as they had reached the top floor without a hitch and were preparing to open that silvery white door, the robots behind them made clacking noises and stretched their metal arms towards them. While their arms were moving, a launch tunnel that looked like a gun came out from within their arms.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi abruptly turned pale with fright, \u201cCrap! Are those real? I thought they were just toys!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it really good to give a five year old kid such dangerous and lethal things?</p><br/><p>She really didn\u2019t know how to criticise Lu Tingxiao\u2019s child-raising methods anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Ning Xi was on the verge of tears.</p><br/><p>They were only here to find Little Treasure, why did they have to go through so many trials and tribulations? It was like they were going through a dungeon in a game.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao held onto her shoulders and pushed her to the door panel behind them. Following that, he used his whole body to cover her, while he placed one arm on the door behind her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stayed silent for three seconds before swallowing her saliva and saying slowly: \u201cBig Boss\u2026 do you know that you just did an extremely precise kabedon position?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKerby dawn?\u201d This was clearly another term that Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi facepalmed. Flirting without meaning to is the most dangerous thing to do, my dear!</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that Ning Xi spotted something from the corner of her eyes: a robot had actually aimed at Lu Tingxiao\u2019s back and fired a shot, \u201cLu Tingxiao! Watch out!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it was too late. Lu Tingxiao covered her tightly and let out a muffled grunt.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Tingxiao\u2014\u2014\u201d Ning Xi was in a complete panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Lu Tingxiao slowly raised his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you be fine! Lu Tingxiao, are you okay? I\u2019ll send you to\u2026 Urk\u2026\u201d While in the middle of speaking, Ning Xi felt her stomach churning, \u201cLu Tingxiao, you\u2019re really stinky\u2026 What\u2019s so smelly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao took off his jacket with a dark expression. A sticky, disgusting-looking object was stuck on the back of his jacket.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi covered her nose. While relaxing because he was fine, she spoke with a speechless expression, \u201cWhat is this? It can\u2019t be poop, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao tossed his jacket to the floor below and said expressionlessly, \u201cSurstr\u00f6mming. It\u2019s said to be the world\u2019s smelliest canned food, it was Lu Jingli\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cSecond Young Master really has the brightest ideas\u2026 It\u2019s not just smelly, it\u2019s practically a biochemical weapon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she finished speaking, the door behind her suddenly opened towards them by itself\u2026</p><br/><p>TL Note: A summary of this chapter: robots, kabedon and Surstr\u00f6mming\u2026 Only in HM!</p><br/><p>Kabedon\u2026 Kabedon can only be explained through a pic:</p><br/><p>Kabedon is a Japanese word that is pronounced like \u2018car-bay-dawn\u2019. In the original Chinese text, Lu Tingxiao said something with the same pronunciation, but a totally different meaning. To get the same effect, I used \u2018kerby dawn\u2019. I hope that got through to you guys! \ud83d\ude00</p><br/><p>Surstr\u00f6mming is basically Swedish fermented fish in a can, also known as the world\u2019s smelliest food (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surstr%C3%B6mming).</p><br/>\n</div>"}

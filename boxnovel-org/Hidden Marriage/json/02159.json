Are you sure?! Don\u2019t just give a random answer! Who\u2019s Zero? What\u2019s Prison Cage? I\u2019ve never even heard of it before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng looked at Mo Lingtian with a complicated expression. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard Tianxin mention it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky bastard! You\u2019re right!\u201d Feng Xiaoxiao clenched her teeth again as she looked at the answer on the scrap of paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! That\u2019s correct? How did you do that? Do you really know how to read minds?\u201d Tang Lang was impressed.</p><br/><p>Mo Lingtian\u2019s eyes looked at the girl at the opposite and he did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli and Jiang Muye, who knew about their relationship, studied him oddly. Qin Mufeng frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao glanced over at Mo Lingtian too, but he was not surprised. He turned to Feng Xiaoxiao and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the second level?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao suddenly got excited. She touched her chin and scanned all the men with a lascivious smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe, the second level\u2026 Pick anyone from your group and wear a female outfit. You\u2019ll pass if all of us agree that the person is pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone set their eyes onto\u2026 Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye had been dragged over by Lu Jingli. He just wanted to stay in a corner but who knew that he would be involved in such a way!?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Why are you guys looking at me? Don\u2019t even think about it!\u201d Jiang Muye felt so uncomfortable when everyone was staring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of us! Time for you to contribute!\u201d Lu Jingli said.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang went along as well. \u201cIt\u2019s just acting like a girl! How easy! It\u2019s not your first time anyway!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cIf it\u2019s so easy, then you guys do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is that we need to impress the girls. That\u2019s very difficult. Only you can do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlattery doesn\u2019t work on me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao then said, \u201cI\u2019ll owe you one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cReally? Anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>It took three seconds for Jiang Muye to change his stance. \u201cDeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having Lu Tingxiao owe him one would mean he could avoid his mother forcing him to get married!</p><br/><p>After some time, Jiang Muye finally came back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! So beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God, how pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any more regrets now!\u201d</p><br/><p>While it was a big sacrifice, he did get very excellent feedback. All the girls were satisfied.</p><br/><p>Even the picky Feng Xiaoxiao had nothing to complain about. \u201cThat\u2019s unfair! You look even better than me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that enough? Did we pass?\u201d Jiang Muye was annoyed.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao waved her hand. \u201cPass!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only the last level was left.</p><br/><p>The men looked at each other and thought that the last level was going to be extremely difficult.</p></div>\n</div>"}

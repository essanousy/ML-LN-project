The top two are both people from Starlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first is Han Zixuan, while the second is Yin Youyou, who was under Xu Tao before. The third one is someone from Speedy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u201cNational Goddess\u201d ranking isn\u2019t looking good as well. Han Zixuan is leading the top spot with votes thrice as many as the runner-up at the moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s expression darkened as he kept quiet.</p><br/><p>Lei Ming continued, \u201cStarlight probably thought that they can\u2019t stop you anymore, so they didn\u2019t put much effort on your side this time, but they probably didn\u2019t expect you to be so tough to leave them with nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei Ming paused, \u201cHowever, as for Han Zixuan, since so many things have happened just recently, they would surely snap the ranking up because Han Zixuan was humiliated by Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Ning Xi just stole the top spot away the moment she came back, it just means that Han Zixuan\u2019s popularity is way below Ning Xi\u2019s who just came back out of retirement. While this ranking might seem not important and be just for show, the influence that stems from the discussion of this ranking can affect a whole lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye laughed coldly like he expected it. \u201cSo, Starlight would do anything to help Han Zixuan to keep these two rankings!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei Ming nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right, and you know Glory World isn\u2019t in the best of state. If the whole of Starlight decide to help Han Zixuan to get this, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference even if we did anything! The gap is too big!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how powerful Ning Xi\u2019s comeback this time was, or how successful the press conference went, her spot could not overtake Han Zixuan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and tell Xu Tao that I\u2019ll pay for Ning Xiao Xi\u2019s vote!\u201d Jiang Muye growled angrily.</p><br/><p>Lei Ming was trapped between laughter and tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s not about the money. The amount of votes we can get in private is very limited. Moreover, you have to ask Ning Xi\u2019s opinion, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye took up his phone and called Ning Xi right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Ning Xiao Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, my nephew, looking cool today!\u201d Ning Xi teased him over the phone. Obviously, she had seen his fan meeting.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was really angry at first, but the fire within him extinguished when he heard Ning Xi\u2019s teasing. He replied cheekily, \u201cOf course! If I get serious, I\u2019ll be the coolest one around! Wait, no\u2026 What the heck did you call me just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye turned to avoid Lei Ming and lowered his voice to say through clenched teeth, \u201cWhat the heck are you calling me!? I\u2019m talking serious business with you right now!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

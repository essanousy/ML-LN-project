She had simply never mentioned him before?</p><br/><p>When thinking of this possibility, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression turned stormy.</p><br/><p>However, he quickly calmed down, because there was still the likely possibility that that man had purposely said so to strike a blow at his love rival.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Tingxiao, I finished applying the medicine! Are my things there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d Lu Tingxiao regained his senses and passed her belongings over.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao waited until Ning Xi had finished changing before walking in again.</p><br/><p>After changing into her own clothes, Ning Xi felt more at ease, and the atmosphere wasn\u2019t as weird as before. Thus, she took off the blindfold.</p><br/><p>The moment she took off the blindfold, she then saw Lu Tingxiao looking at her with an extremely complicated gaze. She subconsciously touched her face and said in confusion, \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao sat on the side of the bed, \u201cNing Xi, could you tell me about your personal matters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy personal matters? What matters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt that Lu Tingxiao was purposely changing the topic to shift her attention, so she thought for a moment before speaking up, \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you about my hometown!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although that wasn\u2019t the answer that he had expected, they would surely bump into that topic eventually.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this was the only time, and the very first time she had ever talked about her personal matters to him.</p><br/><p>Thus, Lu Tingxiao nodded, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Tingxiao, in the outskirts of C City, there\u2019s a small town called Spring Wind Town? Uh, a small place like that, you surely wouldn\u2019t know of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know of it. The scenery there is good. \u300aHero in a Chaotic World\u300b filmed a few scenes there, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi heard that, she got excited, \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! So you knew about that! The scene in \u300aHero in a Chaotic World\u300b where the main couple rolled in the hay in the wheat fields was filmed in our town!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh, what \u2018rolled in the hay\u2019! Why did she mention rolling in the hay at this kind of time! She had chatted so much just to forget about that kind of topic okay!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi hurriedly stopped the progression of this dangerous topic. She coughed once, \u201cMost importantly, because the town hasn\u2019t been developed much, so the environment there is really good and the air is very fresh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA few years ago, Lu Jingli clamoured to go fishing there a few times, but I was too busy with work then, so we ended up not going.\u201d There was some regret in Lu Tingxiao\u2019s voice. If he had gone then, would he have met her earlier?</p><br/><p>When looking at it from a certain point of view, Lu Jingli could be counted as the matchmaker for him and Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Although he hadn\u2019t gone that time, he had still met her eventually.</p><br/><p>It was also because Lu Jingli had taken Little Treasure to a bar that they had been brought together.</p><br/><p>Hm, I\u2019ll reward him properly when I get back!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have the chance, you should go there at least once, you won\u2019t be disappointed! If you do, I can be your tour guide!\u201d When speaking of her hometown, Ning Xi\u2019s face was filled with excitement, but slowly, her expression dimmed, \u201cMore than twenty years ago, the air was even better. Back then, many rich people would come for a vacation. Quite a few of them would come while pregnant for the sake of their health. Twenty four years ago, one of them was Madam Ning, Zhuang Lingyu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi suddenly went silent.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t push her, but simply waited for her quietly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a deep breath and continued speaking as if she were narrating a story, \u201cMadam Ning had been prepared to stay in Spring Wind Town for the duration of her pregnancy, and was going to give birth back in the city. She didn\u2019t expect that she would accidentally induce labour, causing the child to be born early\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

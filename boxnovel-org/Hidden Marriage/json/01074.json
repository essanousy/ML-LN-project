She said my proposal went through! I can open a shop with Spirit Studio now, hahahaha\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Xinyan\u2019s voice was pretty loud, even Qiao Weilan could hear her.</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations!\" Ning Xi smiled.</p><br/><p>There was a short silence, then came Lu Xinyan\u2019s awkward voice, \"Well...thank you!\"</p><br/><p>\"For?\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for helping me! I\u2019m a fair person! You helped me, so of course, I\u2019m going to thank you!\" Lu Xinyan said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi humbly replied, \"Thank you for your fairness, Ms. Lu, but you don\u2019t have to thank me. I didn\u2019t do anything. When Director Qiao came to me earlier, they had already decided to accept your proposal.\"</p><br/><p>\"Does it mean I passed with my own abilities?\" Lu Xinyan\u2019s tone was full of excitement.</p><br/><p>\"You can say so.\" Ning Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>There was another short scream again. Lu Xinyan then cleared her throat, \"Well, then thank you for being fair and not hindering my proposal submission!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re welcome.\"</p><br/><p>\"Just wait and see, my shop will definitely score the top sales among the six!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I\u2019m looking forward to it!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi finished the call, Qiao Weilan asked, \"Boss, you know Lu Xinyan?\"</p><br/><p>From their conversation, they seemed pretty close.</p><br/><p>\"Sort of! We had some complicated matters between us before and she thought I'd purposely obstruct her proposal...but the misunderstanding is probably cleared by now!\" Ning Xi explained.</p><br/><p>Qiao Weilan nodded, then took another look at the woman in front of her again.</p><br/><p>The more she knew, the more she felt like this woman was like a mystery with many secrets dwelling within her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>After she left the studio, she went to the garage with her car key. As she got into the car, her phone rang again.</p><br/><p>The screen showed it was Tang Lang.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi picked up the call. \"Hello, Second Senior Brother? What\u2019s up?\"</p><br/><p>\"Little Junior Sister, I just received interesting news! Come to the usual place!\" Tang Lang\u2019s oddly excited voice came over from the phone.</p><br/><p>\"Interesting news? What interesting news?\"</p><br/><p>\"Come and you\u2019ll know! Quick! Remember to bring some money with you! I don\u2019t have any! It\u2019ll be on your tab!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was about to go home but after the call from the mysterious Tang Lang, she drove towards bar Number 8.</p><br/><p>\"Did you bring enough money?\" Tang Lang asked her urgently when she reached.</p><br/><p>\"Yes I did, what\u2019s the matter?\" Ning Xi asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>\"Water! Get me another bottle of Remy Martin Club Brandy!\" Tang Lang yelled generously after his human ATM arrived.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi slammed her hand on the table hard. \"Hey! Did you lie just to get me here to pay for your alcohol?\"</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was stuffing popcorn into his mouth greedily and dropped the whole bowl when Ning Xi slammed the table. He then put on a mature expression and haughtily said, \"Rude! How can you talk to your master like this?!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi clenched her teeth, then put on a sickly sweet, honeyed smile. \"If guns weren\u2019t banned in China, do you think I\u2019d need you?!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m telling you even if God were here today, He wouldn\u2019t be able to save you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little <em>tangyuan </em> begged pitifully, \u201cSecond Uncle, I know I\u2019m wrong! Please don\u2019t be angry, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was not moved at all. \u201cDon\u2019t come at me with this. You\u2019ve already said such things over eight hundred times!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little <em>tangyuan </em> then said, \u201cSecond Uncle, you can\u2019t be angry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli then replied, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be angry? I\u2019m about to be angered to death by you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Solemness filled the <em>tangyuan </em>\u2018s delicate little face as she said earnestly, \u201cEven though you look very handsome when you\u2019re angry, Second Uncle, you look even more handsome when you\u2019re not angry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s fury had calmed down a little although he was still angry as he shot her a side look. \u201cAre you telling the truth? How handsome?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little <em>tangyuan </em> immediately said without hesitation, \u201cMore handsome than my father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s fire of fury was instantly extinguished by half. \u201cAt least you\u2019ve got good judgment! But don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll let you go this time just because you said that. Your father and your mother can\u2019t bear to hit you, but this time I will still give you a lesson. You\u2019re too naughty, do you know that? You won\u2019t be able to escape my spanking this time. Give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little <em>tangyuan </em> was so frightened that her neck shrunk. \u201cThen\u2026 then before you spank me, can you help me find something, Second Uncle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli glanced at her with alarm. \u201cWhat do you want to find?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little <em>tangyuan </em> answered weakly, \u201cThere\u2019s something I left at your place, Second Uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you to run around?! It\u2019d be weird if you didn\u2019t misplace anything! What did you leave at my place? Is it something very important?\u201d Lu Jingli asked unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery important!\u201d Little <em>tangyuan </em> blinked her big, teary eyes and nodded vigorously. Then, she used her little hands to make a little heart-shaped sign as she said in her baby voice, \u201cMy little heart\u2026 I left it at your place, Second Uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she kissed Lu Jingli\u2019s cheeks lightly. \u201cTangyuan likes Second Uncle the most\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was speechless.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli sent all those vegetables that the little demon wrecked to Lu Tingxiao\u2019s place. Then, he happily led the little <em>tangyuan </em> to his other vegetable garden.</p><br/><p>Inside the villa, when he saw the duo walk out happily, Little Treasure sighed helplessly.</p><br/><p>Sigh, why was his Second Uncle so forgetful?</p><br/><p>He knew it was useless\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi held her forehead with dread. \u201cWho does little <em>tangyuan </em> actually take after? She\u2019s so good at seduction!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli had already been tortured by her thousands of times, yet he still treated her like a little baby. It was not only Lu Jingli; she subdued almost everyone around.</p><br/><p>Beside her, when Lu Tingxiao heard his wife, he looked at her meaningfully.</p><br/><p>When she received her darling\u2019s meaningful look, Ning Xi cleared her throat awkwardly. \u201cOkay, okay, it\u2019s my fault, my fault\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao walked slowly to his wife. He leaned forward and kissed lightly on her forehead. \u201cMy wife gave birth to such a cute pair of son and daughter. How are you at fault?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless when she was caught off-guard by this flirt.</p><br/><p><em>Hehe, this little </em>tangyuan\u2019s <em>genes were definitely not her fault alone!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

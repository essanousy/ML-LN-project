He swiftly replied when she called out to him.</p><br/><p>\"I'd like to know... what year is it now?\"</p><br/><p>The owner's expression turned from impressed to stunned. He was thinking that maybe this beautiful girl was actually mentally challenged.</p><br/><p>\"Uh, Miss, are you alright? It's 201X year now... By the way, I think I've never seen you in town before.

She could see from afar that Lu Jingli was waiting for her,\nanxiously walking back and forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi Xi, you\u2019re finally here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Little Treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the house! Come with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I really just walk in like this? Will anyone find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my father has gone outstation today and will only be\nreturning tomorrow morning. I\u2019ve already dismissed the maids and\nbutlers. Actually, my mother is no longer against the both of you\nanymore, she just wants Little Treasure to be happy. It\u2019s just my\nfather; he\u2019s still too hard-headed and I can\u2019t seem to get through to\nhim just yet\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli went on and on as he showed her the way into\nthe house.</p><br/><p>In the garden, Ning Xi suddenly stopped midway and looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xi Xi, let\u2019s go! What are you looking at?\u201d asked a confused Lu Jingli.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing\u2026I just keep having the feeling that someone\u2019s watching\nme\u2026maybe I\u2019ve just been a little bit paranoid lately\u2026\u201d said Ning Xi,\nbefore she continued following him.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli, on the other hand, was relieved. He subconsciously looked\nup and thought to himself, Xiao Xi Xi, you aren\u2019t paranoid, you\u2019re just\ntoo alert!</p><br/><p>His brother was up there evading her.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli brought Ning Xi to Little Treasure\u2019s room, \u201cDun dun dun! Little Treasure, look who has come to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure was zoning out on the bed, and despite hearing Lu Jingli\u2019s voice, he did not react at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli awkwardly rubbed his nose and let Ning Xi pass through, \u201cYou go!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was slightly nervous. On the way here, she wanted to travel at\nthe speed of light. Yet, now as she faced Little Treasure, she did not\nknow what to do or say.</p><br/><p>Her mind flashed the little man\u2019s melancholic question repeatedly in\nher head, \u201cAunty Xiao Xi, Little Treasure has been very good, Why don\u2019t\nyou want Little Treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>She underestimated the feelings Little Treasure had for her, and\ncruelly thought that he was only a child, that he would forget her\neventually as the days go by. She didn\u2019t know that she would inflict\nsuch harm onto his emotional well-being.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d Ning Xi lightly held the little bun\u2019s hand. It\nhad only been a few days since she last saw him, and already the little\nbun had lost some weight. It had not been easy for her to plump him up.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure only blinked slightly, but there was no other reaction.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi fell silent. Apart from apologising, she did not know what\nelse she could say. She knew she was unable to keep any of her promises,\nunable to promise him that she would accompany him forever, unable to\nirresponsibly use such words just to coax him.</p><br/><p>But she had to find a way to cheer him up.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli started to be anxious as he looked at Little Treasure who\nremained stiff and not reactive, then looked at Ning Xi who was silent.</p><br/><p>This was not what he had expected at all. Why was Little Treasure\nstill so motionless? I hope it\u2019s not because Little Treasure\u2019s illness\nis so severe that even Ning Xi cannot help him feel better?</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond master, I have an unorthodox request,\u201d Ning Xi suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh? What is it? Just say it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I take Little Treasure away tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You want to take Little Treasure away!?\u201d Lu Jingli was flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. If I stay here long, I would have to be on alert all the time,\nand I can\u2019t communicate properly with Little Treasure. Besides, if I\u2019m\nguessing correctly, Little Treasure has already been in here for quite a\nnumber of days, right? What he really needs now is a change of\natmosphere to lighten up!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

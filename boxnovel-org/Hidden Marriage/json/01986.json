However, he had been held back each time by Ning Xi\u2019s timely temptation of delicious food.</p><br/><p>As for Ning Xi, this Master could be settled with just a few delicious meals. If she found it troublesome, she could order a few sets of luxurious family buckets, and even save the hassle of cooking.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle baby, darling!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second day, Ning Xi waved a piece of raw imported beef to tease the white tiger in the living room.</p><br/><p>The tiger instantly stood up, seeming like it was in great spirits as it wagged its huge, snow-white tail and walked towards Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold claw-claw!\u201d Ning Xi enticed.</p><br/><p>The tiger tilted its head to one side and stared adorably at Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was about to feed the tiger when suddenly, Han Xiao appeared and snatched away the few bags of imported beef beside Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026 This is the tiger\u2019s food\u2026 It\u2019s still raw!\u201d Ning Xi did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao tossed the beef to Tang Lang who was not far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Grandfather, please wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang eagerly ran to the kitchen and swiftly pan fried the beef until it was medium well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck?! You two\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at Han Xiao, then at Tang Lang.</p><br/><p>These two people were colluding!</p><br/><p>Especially Tang Lang!

It looks like the defenses around this place is rather mediocre.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too careless either. Since the higher-ups will get us to make the move, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not that simple,\u201d said the European elder.</p><br/><p>These two were the top assassins in the \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d assassin rankings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people that Qiao Yi sent out were useless.\u201d The black man who was called Yorick used a paper to wipe away the blood stains on his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the European King\u2019s forces didn\u2019t want to dominate Asia, how could they have been interested in Qiao Yi as the controller? He can\u2019t even handle this little thing and need us to take action. What a joke!\u201d Yorick squatted down and wiped away the dust on his leather shoes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best to be more careful. Being a mission from the higher-ups, we cannot fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>The European elder smiled slightly and walked towards the direction of the garden house.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>About half an hour later, Yorick pulled out a submachine gun in front of the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cYorick, don\u2019t be so crude. We\u2019re here to visit,\u201d said the elder.</p><br/><p>Yorick shrugged and put his gunt away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anyone there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The European elder knocked very politely.</p><br/><p>Very soon, Ning Xi opened the door.</p><br/><p>As she stared at this kind elder, Ning Xi was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, please forgive us for boldly disturbing you.\u201d The European elder looked at Ning Xi and smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Ning Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang held half a watermelon and walked up to the door too.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, may we know if this lady is Miss Ning Xi?\u201d The European elder smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Ning Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Miss Ning Xi,\u201d the European elder continued, \u201cDo you have any last words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the European elder took out a surgical blade as the peaceful smile on his face turned wider.</p></div>\n</div>"}

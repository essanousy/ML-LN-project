She was hooked up to an IV, and Lu Tingxiao was sitting by her bed with an imposing, overcast expression.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli and Qin Mufeng exchanged glances, clearly frightened by Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a nurse walked in carrying a tray of medicine. Lu Jingli hurriedly pulled her aside to ask quietly, \u201cHow\u2019s the patient? What\u2019s the problem? Is it serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe patient is running a fever at 39.6 degrees celsius.\u201d The nurse replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, a fever\u2026 What? A fever?\u201d Lu Jingli was stupefied, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a fever? It\u2019s just a fever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re sure. We\u2019ve already done a full body check up, there\u2019s no problem at all, please don\u2019t worry. The mister in the ward has already asked us quite a few times.\u201d The nurse replied without a shred of impatience, because\u2026 the guy in the ward, and these two standing at the entrance\u2026 were too handsome! She was willing to answer them even if they asked her the same question a hundred times over!</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli held onto the door frame weakly and patted his still pounding heart, \u201cBro, are you trying to scare me to death? She\u2019s only having a fever, why do you look like she just got a terminal disease?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng also showed a helpless expression, \u201cYou even called me over. Although I\u2019m a doctor, I heal minds, not the body!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised his gaze and swept a cold glance at Qin Mufeng, \u201cSince Ning Xi has already replaced you, perhaps I should save on this expense.\u201d</p><br/><p>He clearly meant that he was going to fire him.</p><br/><p>The amount that he paid Qin Mufeng every year wasn\u2019t cheap.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, please don\u2019t! Other than curing Little Treasure, I have other uses! I\u2019m acquainted with a famous nutritionist in this hospital, I\u2019ll call him over now to create a nutrition plan for Ning Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng felt a little guilty. Ever since Ning Xi had come, he had been rather idle. Little Treasure and Lu Tingxiao hardly needed him now, even their weekly therapy sessions had been cancelled.</p><br/><p>After Qin Mufeng left, Lu Jingli saw that Lu Tingxiao had his head bent over his phone and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cBro, what are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>When had his brother become a youngster addicted to the Internet?</p><br/><p>In the end, when he walked closer, he was shocked.</p><br/><p>His brother had actually copied the surveillance footage from before into his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck! Bro, what are you doing watching this? Xiao Xixi looks so scary, when I was watching this video, I felt goosebumps all over! I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s acting or if she\u2019s for real\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli shivered as he spoke.</p><br/><p>However, right now, his brother was actually playing it on loop and even had a mystical expression that practically broadcasted his thoughts: my wife is too cute\u2026</p><br/><p>He was really\u2026 beyond hope\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, your two hearts are linked as one, even the way you think is the same! Simple and violent! Tsk tsk, you\u2019re really one family!\u201d Lu Jingli lamented.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stroked the face of the girl lying on the sick bed, his pride in her as clear as day.</p><br/><p>To prevent his single dog eyes from getting blinded, Lu Jingli turned his head away from the overly romantic sight, \u201cYou must have found the culprit\u2019s identity by now, right? Is the next step announcing it on the Internet to help Xiao Xixi clear her name? I\u2019ll go do it right now?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

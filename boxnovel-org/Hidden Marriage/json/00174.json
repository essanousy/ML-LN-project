She was in absolute delight as she scrolled through Weibo, reading online comments flaming Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Cui Caijing massaged her calves while speaking in a flattering tone, \u201cXueluo-jie, your legs are so shapely. They\u2019re so long and so straight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, they were only slightly better looking than the legs of most people. The amount she spent on maintaining her shape every year ran into a few hundred thousand yuan, how could her legs not look good?</p><br/><p>However, Ning Xueluo clearly enjoyed the praise. Pleased with herself, she said, \u201cI was born like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Chang Li felt uneasy and spoke up with concern, \u201cXueluo, Ning Xi hasn\u2019t appeared for so long. She couldn\u2019t possibly be scheming against us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Ning Xueluo replied with undisguised ridicule and disdain in her voice, \u201cYou\u2019re overestimating her. Even if she sells her body to a hundred men, she won\u2019t be able to turn the tables on this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. In the entertainment circle, artistes with a bad track record like this usually end up in a situation worse than Jia Qingqing\u2019s! It\u2019ll be useless even if anyone tries to help her clear the air!\u201d Chang Li\u2019s heart calmed down a little, \u201cRight, I just sent Ning Xi an email. I gave her an ultimatum: she has to come down to the office tomorrow before 6pm or we\u2019ll crush her public image. I believe she\u2019ll come out of hiding tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember to arrange for some reporters to wait for her!\u201d Ning Xueluo was all smiles.</p><br/><p>As she was replying the concerned comments of her fans, a new email notification suddenly popped up on her screen.</p><br/><p>Who would send her an email this late at night? It was her personal email as well\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo didn\u2019t think much of it and casually opened the email. However, with one glance, she immediately froze in shock and spilled red wine all over herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no, Xueluo-jie, what happened to you?\u201d Cui Caijing hurriedly brought over paper towels for her to wipe away the spilled wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cXueluo, what happened?\u201d Chang Li asked with suspicion upon seeing the frightened expression on Ning Xueluo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee for yourself!\u201d Ning Xueluo threw her phone at Cui Caijing\u2019s head with hands trembling in rage. \u201cHow did you handle everything? You left such a huge trace behind! Why did you send that email from my apartment? And didn\u2019t I tell you a million times to use an anonymous account to send the money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dazed, Cui Caijing took a long while to recover from getting hit in the head. She held onto her forehead as she read the email, before freezing in shock. With a panicked expression, she exclaimed, \u201cXueluo-jie, this isn\u2019t my fault! I used an anonymous account! As for the email\u2026 You were there when I sent the email and you didn\u2019t say anything then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo threw the wine glass to the floor. Immediately after that, the sound of shattered glass echoed in the ward, accompanying her shouts, \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t mention it, couldn\u2019t you have thought of it yourself? If you need me to tell you everything, then what\u2019s the use of having you around?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chang Li finished reading the email, her expression turned grave. \u201cMy biggest worries came true! I was afraid that someone would discover some traces of evidence\u2026 Who sent that email? Could it be Zhang Qiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s face seemed dark and sinister as she replied confidently, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Zhang Qiang is just some hoodlum with barely any education. He wouldn\u2019t know anything about IP addresses and anonymous accounts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this is rather strange\u2026 No matter what, Zhang Qiang is the only one who knows about this, excluding us. He must have been the one to leak the news! Could he have conspired with someone else? But Zhang Qiang already ran off ages ago, we can\u2019t contact him to ask!\u201d Chang Li said anxiously.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo violently paced back and forth in the ward, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of saying so much? Most importantly, how should we solve this problem?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

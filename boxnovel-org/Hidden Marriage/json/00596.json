You don\u2019t understand Shiqing. While he may look soft on the outside, he won\u2019t compromise once he has decided on something. He really is that adamant.\"</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s right, Xiao Xi. Don\u2019t push yourself too hard, we\u2019re not blaming you. It really isn't your fault,\" Mother Xi echoed, afraid that Ning Xi was putting all the blame on herself.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, Aunty, I understand but I won\u2019t back off until I\u2019ve tried everything I can. Let me give it one more shot!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s expression changed swiftly after she ended the call.</p><br/><p>Knocking him out and taking him back by force would not be the best solution. If Xi Shiqing was not going to change his mind, he would just leave after he waking up anyway.</p><br/><p>What should she do?</p><br/><p>At the same time, a black car was parked under a big tree near the temple.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao frowned as he checked the time on his phone.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s taking her so long?\" Lu Jingli had already arrived to meet his brother.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao got out of the car to light a cigarette, looking impatient.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli scratched his head and tailed his brother. \"We can\u2019t just sit here and wait. Should we go in and see what\u2019s happening?\"</p><br/><p>\"I can\u2019t.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ugh, okay...you're not the best person to go...you might make him go crazy again\u2026\" Lu Jingli mumbled. He then said, \"I\u2019ll go then! I\u2019ll just go and check on what\u2019s happening! It\u2019d be really terrible if the Xi's pressured Ning Xi and she\u2019s forced to tell them what actually happened last night. They might even force her to try and get together with Xi Shiqing for a little while!\"</p><br/><p>This was what Lu Tingxiao had been worrying about.</p><br/><p>With Ning Xi\u2019s personality, if people from the Ning family went soft on her, she would definitely try everything she could to bring Xi Shiqing back.</p><br/><p>\"Bro, I\u2019ll go now, I\u2019ll let you know immediately if anything happens! I\u2019ll stop Sister-in-law if she\u2019s going to try something risky!\" Lu Jingli went in as Lu Tingxiao kept silent.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure poked his little head out from the car and held up his writing board: [Father, is there anything that I can help with?]</p><br/><p>The little guy was actually going to cooperate after what happened last night.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked at his son with a loving gaze. \"Thank you but you can\u2019t help me this time.\"</p><br/><p>The little bun looked down disappointedly.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi went back into the room once again.</p><br/><p>After asking around, Lu Jingli quickly went to the zen room.</p><br/><p>Xi Shiqing saw Ning Xi return but he remained expressionless as if his world only consisted of him and the scripture book he was holding. There was only the Buddha in his heart and he was completely determined to ascend towards the true meaning of Buddhism.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stepped right in front of him and snatched his book of scripture out of his hands.</p><br/><p>As expected, Xi Shiqing was not angry and stayed calm in his seated position.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi tossed the book away and closed in on Xi Shiqing swiftly, one of her knee positioned beside his torso, an arm crossing over him and her face a millimeter-close to his, nearly at point-blank...</p><br/><p>Xi Shiqing\u2019s eyebrows twitched ever so slightly.</p><br/><p>As he was about to say something, Ning Xi stole his chance as she pressed on his shoulder and held him down, using her body to envelope his at the same time\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

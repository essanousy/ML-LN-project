Apart from the exception of the newcomers\u2019 category, the others are using the same nomination list.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, there\u2019ve been fans who voted that way because they thought it was fun or just wanted to pull a prank, but votes like these were very, very few. It\u2019s never affected the final results before, but this time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut they can\u2019t do this! It\u2019s nonsense! Don\u2019t the organizers care?\u201d Zheng Anru said angrily.</p><br/><p>Liu Wenliang then replied, \u201cIn the rules and regulations, there aren\u2019t any that prohibits this. The organizers probably left it this way to make things more fun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContact CEO Wang. Tell him to pressure the organizers! Accuse her of cheating! Or just say that she\u2019s buying votes! Make her lose her spot in all the rankings! I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s no way to counter her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the issue of Ning Xi dominating the female artistes\u2019 ranking was solved, another problem had cropped up with the male artiste\u2019s ranking. Zheng Anru was thoroughly enraged.</p><br/><p>Liu Wenliang fully understood what the organizers were thinking. Things were not as simple as Zheng Anru thought, but since it had come to this point now, there was no harm in trying.</p><br/><p>The ranking this time was definitely important, even for him personally.</p><br/><p>If things went wrong again, he would be the first one to take the hit.</p><br/><p>Wang Haojun and Ning Xueluo had been invited to the event tonight. Ning Xueluo was busy with Su Yan\u2019s matter and was not present, but Wang Haojun was there in the VIP area.</p><br/><p>He had witnessed what happened.</p><br/><p>He did not need Liu Wenliang\u2019s reminder and had already gone towards the backstage secretly.</p><br/><p>Wang Haojun lit up a cigarette for Qin Zhen as he acted like an old buddy and put his arms over the man\u2019s shoulders. \u201cProducer Qin, having a female artiste on the male artiste list? Isn\u2019t this a little too nonsensical?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the main producer of Entertainment\u2019s Light and the head of Night of Starlight, Qin Zhen\u2019s eyes turned a little wary when a certain someone approached him.</p><br/><p>It was not difficult to guess Wang Haojun\u2019s intentions, so he replied, \u201cCEO Wang, the rules for the rankings have been the same every year. I\u2019m pretty sure you know that while nothing like this happened in the past years, the rules allow it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u201cNight of Starlight\u201d had reached a new height and popularity thanks to Ning Xi. He was wholly enjoying it, so why would he put a stop on this?</p><br/><p>In the end, there were no friends forever in this industry. Long live benefits!</p><br/><p>Wang Haojun was able to guess what the sly fox in front of him was thinking, but as he was pressed for time, he clenched his teeth and flashed him a number with his fingers. \u201cRemove Ning Xi from all the ranking in the name of violating the rules! After it\u2019s done, I\u2019ll give you this figure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Zhen\u2019s eyes brightened a little when he saw Wang Haojun\u2019s hand, and he was obviously shaken.</p><br/><p>However, as he was hesitating, he saw the real-time ranking through a crack in the door that was not completely shut.</p><br/><p>He did not even know about it, so he was shocked when he found out.</p><br/><p>In the brief moment of exchange with Wang Haojun, Ning Xi had rushed her way into the top five in the male artiste list. She had reached top three in the \u201cMost Desired Male Artiste To Sleep With\u201d category, and it was still rapidly on the rise!</p></div>\n</div>"}

He immediately said with incomparable regret, \u201cBro, if you keep on doing this, you\u2019ll be wasting your strength. Why didn\u2019t you just immediately pounce on Xiao Xixi? What a waste!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked coldly at him in askance, \u201cAnd what do you think would result from doing that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Lu Jingli rubbed his chin and said seriously, \u201cYou\u2019ve always used Little Treasure as an excuse to get closer so that she wouldn\u2019t get alarmed and run off. If you exposed your trap at this time\u2026 Xiao Xixi would most likely run thousands and thousands of miles away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although that was the truth, having Lu Jingli say it out just like that made his mood rather bad.</p><br/><p>Actually, he had wanted to find out what she thought about it while acting recklessly last night. However, the extreme fear and rejection that Ning Xi had had instantly forced him awake.</p><br/><p>After that, his way of handling it had been proven right. Otherwise, in that situation, Ning Xi would surely have been scared off by him.</p><br/><p>Why did she have that kind of reaction? What had she experienced before\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, can I ask you a question? Why is your mood so unstable lately? Did something happen?\u201d Lu Jingli asked carefully.</p><br/><p>He had already been rather tactful in putting it this way. Truthfully, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s temper had been so irritable that he seemed like a girl on her period.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao knocked against the armrest of his chair with the joints of his long, slender fingers. He spoke calmly: \u201cThe one who sent flowers that day was Jiang Muye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d Lu Jingli stared in a daze for a long while before finally reacting to Lu Tingxiao\u2019s news. Following that, he jumped up\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Corrupted Devil King is Jiang Muye! Didn\u2019t he just return back the day before yesterday? I even got the news that he was going to be the second male lead for \u300aLand Under Heaven\u300b!\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t thought that he had this kind of relationship with Xiao Xixi. It looked like that kid had suddenly come back for some reason. Furthermore, the first movie he had chosen after coming back was \u300aLand Under Heaven\u300b. This was food for thought! He had many intimate scenes with Xiao Xixi in the movie tsk tsk\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, let me think. Has he met with Xiao Xixi recently? And you saw it? You even saw some ambiguous scene?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s guesses were all on the money.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god, no wonder you haven\u2019t be acting right recently!\u201d Lu Jingli paced wildly on the spot, \u201cWho would have thought that we had a traitor in our ranks! Then what about YS? Did you find that out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes darkened, \u201cThe person who sent the diamond vanished without a trace after leaving the set. Furthermore, the diamond\u2019s origins can\u2019t be traced. It\u2019s most likely smuggled goods brought in from a special channel.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Lu Jingli\u2019s mouth twitched upon hearing so. He said somewhat speechlessly, \u201cThere\u2019s another headache. It can\u2019t have anything to do with the Lu family this time, right? Y\u2026 S\u2026 Is there anyone who has those initials by our side? It seems like there isn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, it was so complicated for his dear brother to get a simple date. Other people had dating lives like some romantic drama, his was practically a mystery detective novel!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s phone rang. It was a message from Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Upon reading the contents, the dangerous creature hibernating in the depths of Lu Tingxiao\u2019s eyes threatened to move.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli moved closer curiously, \u201cXiao Xixi\u2019s message\u2026 what did she say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did his brother look as if he had been cheated on?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stared at that message for a few more seconds before immediately calling her.</p><br/><p>At residence no.6, Ning Xi quickly picked up the call, \u201cHello, Lu Tingxiao, is anything the matter? Did you see the message I just sent? Remember to show it to Little Treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it. Where are you?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glanced at the kitchen, where Jiang Muye was busy trying to show off his culinary skills, \u201cI\u2019m at Jiang Muye\u2019s place. I have something to discuss with him, plus he just got back, so I\u2019m having a welcome dinner with him.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

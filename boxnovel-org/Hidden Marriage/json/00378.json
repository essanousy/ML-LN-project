When he went into gossip mode, his eyes transformed into the all-seeing eagle's eyes. He actually already saw what the contents of the messages and he touched his chin contemplatively.</p><br/><p>YS\u2026</p><br/><p>As expected it was that fellow!</p><br/><p>Tsk! Good, tonight\u2019s mission was accomplished!</p><br/><p>Of course, it could have been done better!</p><br/><p>Li Jingli started his questioning again, \"Xiao Xi Xi, which dishes from the two masters did you think tasted better?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was going to collapse in frustration; it was her third time facing this question in a short span of time!</p><br/><p>Do not ask these trap questions again, please!</p><br/><p>This was not a compulsory question, it was more of a question with a dead end\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stared at him harshly, \"Shut up! No more questions! It\u2019s late now! You\u2019ve eaten your fill, and you've got your gossip! Go back quickly! If not, I\u2019m going to complain to your brother that you\u2019re still troubling me in the middle of the night!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli backed off with fear, \"How could you do this to me, Xiao Xi Xi? You\u2019ve changed!\"</p><br/><p>\"So are you leaving or not? I\u2019m going to call him right now!\" Ning Xi threatened him by holding up her phone.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s eyes went teary but for his own personal safety, he ran away quickly!</p><br/><p>When she saw that Lu Jingli had finally left, Ning Xi was relieved.</p><br/><p>She was still sleepy earlier, but after Lu Jingli\u2019s visit and the few messages she received, it seemed like tonight would be a sleepless night\u2026</p><br/><p>But it would not just be Ning Xi having a sleepless night alone\u2026</p><br/><p>---</p><br/><p>Platinum Palace.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli opened the door to the study room and panted while leaning on the door frame, \"Bro! I\u2019m back! I risked my life to get you some information!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked up from a pile of documents, raising his eyebrow at the sight of the traces of dessert on Lu Jingli\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\"Uhh\u2026\" Lu Jingli quickly cleaned it up with his sleeves, \"Ah, it was sister-in-law, she\u2019s just too nice and brought back a box of desserts for me. I didn\u2019t want to eat it actually, but she insisted!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was speechless.</p><br/><p>\"Hehehe, bro! I\u2019ve got some really important information here! Do you want to hear about it?\" Lu Jingli gave a cheeky expression, \"If you invite Elder Cai to make a meal for me, I\u2019ll tell you immediately!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao ignored him and continued to work.</p><br/><p>\"What! Bro, you really don\u2019t want to know? Really? Then I won't talk!\"</p><br/><p>One second\u2026</p><br/><p>Two seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>Three seconds passed\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Fine! Since we\u2019re brothers, I\u2019ll tell you!\" Actually, he just could not contain himself, not even for three seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli quickly said, \"Bro, I'll tell you, the person who wrote the embarrassing love letter, prepared the surprise for Xiao Xi Xi and invited Danial over was as expected, the coward alphabet man YS! Oh, right, you sent Xiao Xi Xi a message just now, didn't you? That fellow sent her a message at the same time as well, and the content was the same! Both of your hearts sure resonate together\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli sighed and mumbled, \"That guy is already starting to take action, and I am sure he will continue courting her. This time he invited a chef, the next time he might be reviving a person! Bro, your future of getting yourself a wife doesn\u2019t seem too bright!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

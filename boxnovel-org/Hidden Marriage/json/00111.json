Leave it to me!\u201d Ning Xi patted her chest with confidence. The more she looked at the pair, one tall and one short, the more excited she became, \u201cAh, I can\u2019t hold back anymore. I really want to take some pictures of you two! Hurry up and come over here. Stand next to each other. Get a little closer. Hold hands\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her commands directed each movement of the father and son pair, arranging them into very compatible poses.</p><br/><p>The more pictures Ning Xi snapped, the more addicted she became. She had practically turned into a fan girl. Out in the little garden of the study room\u2019s balcony, she continuously shot many photos of both father and son.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stood next to her and leaned closer to take a look. He praised, \u201cVery well taken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi waved her hand modestly, \u201cMy photography skills are so-so. I even used a cell phone. Since you guys are such good models and the background is so awesome, every picture looks like it\u2019s from a blockbuster! Oh right, Lu Tingxiao, do you have a WeChat? I\u2019ll add you and send you the pictures! I actually wanted to say this earlier, but who still sends text messages nowadays? They\u2019re so inconvenient! In the future, teach Little Treasure how to use WeChat too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do, just search for my cell phone number.\u201d Lu Tingxiao began to feel glad that Lu Jingli had forced him to open a WeChat account.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Your username is actually just Lu Tingxiao\u2026 that\u2019s so uncreative!\u201d Ning Xi poked fun at Lu Tingxiao as she added him to her friends list.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised his eyebrows and impulsively looked for Ning Xi\u2019s username. Upon seeing it, he was surprised to discover that he didn\u2019t actually recognize some of the Chinese characters.</p><br/><p>My Lonely Empty Loss?</p><br/><p>Why was this username so odd? What did it mean?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao really wanted to ask those questions, but he was also scared that this was internet slang. He could end up exposing the generation gap between them like last time if he asked. Therefore, he opted to stay silent.</p><br/><p>After they had friended each other, Ning Xi sent him all the pictures.</p><br/><p>When Lu Tingxiao received the pictures, he inadvertently noticed that Ning Xi\u2019s personalised signature was: One day, I\u2019ll take a sword and slaughter every unfaithful dog in the world!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending out all the pictures, Ning Xi realized Lu Tingxiao was giving a complicated stare at her signature. Her jaw dropped in embarrassment and she explained awkwardly, \u201cAbout that, that was my signature when I was going through a stupid phase in junior high, and I kept forgetting to change it! Is it that terrifying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao laughed lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>There would be a day when he would become the person to make her change this signature.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso about my username\u2026cough cough. It\u2019s in Martian language. It was really popular online back in the day. It does look rather terrifying now, but I\u2019ve gotten used to it. I\u2019m also too lazy to change it!\u201d Ning Xi explained while scratching her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad. Can you help me change mine to something similar?\u201d Lu Tingxiao requested.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You\u2026 you really think it\u2019s not bad?\u201d Ning Xi was horrified by Lu Tingxiao\u2019s taste.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression was very serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 then I will help you think of one!\u201d Ning Xi regretted it immediately after she had promised him. She couldn\u2019t imagine how Lu Tingxiao\u2019s WeChat friends would react when they saw him change his username into Martian language. That would be such a great scene\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao hardly ever logged into WeChat. Shortly after logging in this time, he noticed that quite a few messages had appeared in his family group chat.</p><br/><p>It turned out that his mother and father were complaining to their relatives that they hadn\u2019t seen their good grandson in a very long time because their eldest son seemed to have recently found a girl he was interested in and was currently pursuing her with passion. Therefore, they didn\u2019t dare disturb him by making a trip to his place.</p><br/><p>While they were complaining, their tone was more like bragging!</p><br/><p>Hah hah hah, our eldest is finally interested in a girl! A GIRL!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at his parent\u2019s words. Afterwards, he casually uploaded all the pictures that Ning Xi had just sent him to the group.</p><br/><p>After a few seconds passed, the entire family group chat exploded.</p><br/><p>TL Note: Martian language is a different way of typing Chinese where they replace the normal characters with numbers, symbols or foreign characters that look similar (eg: Japanese). Think of how people replace letters with numbers for internet slang like l33t or 4lph4b3t!</p><br/><p>If you\u2019re interested to know more, here\u2019s a link to the Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_language</p><br/>\n</div>"}

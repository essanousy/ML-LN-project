Three people who have varying degrees of sticky layers of glitters, sequins and small diamond pieces.</p><br/><p>Just walking down the road, they would be sinfully dropping tens of thousands of dollars, which led to Ning Xi paying attention to where each foot fell. After showering, Ning Xi deliberately changed into more convenient mobile clothing, her posture was one of going to war.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao and Little Treasure were both downstairs too.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi holding the freshly washed little bun and rubbed him lovingly. \u201cCall the servants over to help me start cooking. You two go and watch TV and wait to eat. You just got cleaned, don\u2019t get dirty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no servants today, they are all on holiday\u201d, Lu Ting Xiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoliday?\u201d Ning Xi thought to let Little Treasure get personally involved then.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you came over, do you have an apron? I forgot to get one when we went out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should be\u201d, Lu Ting Xiao replied. From the recently bought bag of groceries, he pulled out a plastic package. After opening it, there are three aprons of the same style inside. Two large and one small.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? When did you buy this?\u201d Ning Xi asked looking surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little girl selling crabs gave this to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, ok\u2026\u2026\u201d really now, who gives that kind of thing!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took the little apron piece while speaking to little bun \u201cLittle Treasure come over, I\u2019ll help you wear your apron.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure with an expression of great anticipation held his small hands out.</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi helped him put it on, tying a cute bow she leans back and sighs \u201cDarling, even while wearing an apron you still look so cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice fading, she turned to see Lu Ting Xiao; wearing a casual clothes with a bright pink apron over it\u2026\u2026surprisingly he still looks quite handsome. This kind of unexpected contrast of a man and Moe (Japanese for cute) is too great!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no\u2026. I can\u2019t suppress the urge to take pictures! \u201c Ning Xi said but she couldn\u2019t decide the pose to choose.</p><br/><p>From time to time she handed different tomatoes to little bun and ribs to tall bun to use as props.</p><br/><p>Posing the cute little bun next to the cool looking tall bun should be a very illegal picture. (too attractive). They have different frames, but are very loving. [Literal translation]</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to take a photo of you?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? I don\u2019t have\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you with Little Treasure\u201d, Lu Ting Xiao said while walking over and helping her put on her apron.</p><br/><p>Little Treasure has been unable to wait and rushes towards Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>In fact, Ning Xi\u2019s private heart doesn\u2019t want to leave too many traces and memories, but she is helpless and cannot stand the longing in Little Treasure\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s no point in thinking about it so much! At present, they\u2019re wine drunk. So let\u2019s leave tomorrow\u2019s worry for tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and the little bun\u2019s style is more consistent. The small bun does a lot of lovely, funny poses while she does the action ones.</p><br/><p>For example, she let Little Bun hold a lot of lotus roots and make a shock wave position while she, Ning Xi pretends to be hit like a fly\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>They played so much that she forgot she came down to cook!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say, Lu Ting Xiao, you are simply a ten all around! Even the pictures you take are so nice! The light composition is too perfect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned the phone around, in the photo Little Treasure face looks amazing. She really wanted to use it as her phone background ah\u2026\u2026but she can\u2019t.</p><br/><p>After all, he has a special identity and she is usually very careful not to disclose any information about Little Treasure. If she had such a lovely son, she would show him off to everyone everyday.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

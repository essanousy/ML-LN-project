How should I address you? My surname\u2019s Wang, I\u2019m Wang Shengzhe,\" Wang Shengzhe asked as he inched closer to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe thought his flirting skills were top-notch, but Ning Xi rolled her eyes so hard that she could practically see her brain.</p><br/><p>What was this!? He was the best flirt in Imperial?</p><br/><p>With this sort of standard?</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026\" She looked at the devil who was slowly ambling towards her.</p><br/><p>After a long, happy chat with his childhood friend, finally , he was coming over! </p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe was really attracted to how Ning Xi gazed in a different direction when speaking to him. How seductive!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ning Xi smiled and answered Wang Shengzhe, \"I go by the surname Ning now, but it\u2019s going to be Lu in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had an aggressive expression on his face but after he heard her, his eyes turned gentle.</p><br/><p>Lu\u2026</p><br/><p>What a great reply! As expected of his wife!</p><br/><p>\"Oh? Which Lu?\" Wang Shengzhe asked.</p><br/><p>\"Lu Tingxiao,\" Ning Xi replied.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was staring at Lu Tingxiao for quite some time. Wang Shengzhe understood her and grinned coldly. \"Heh, Miss Ning, you\u2019re really greedy, aren\u2019t you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why not? I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019ll not marry anyone apart from Lu Tingxiao!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shengzhe almost laughed out loud. \"Every girl in Imperial wants to become Mrs. Lu. Do you think you can really do it? Why don't you...have a more realistic goal?\"</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he tried to extend his hand towards Ning Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lu Tingxiao came in between the two of them.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! CEO Lu, you\u2026\" Wang Shengzhe was a little surprised as he thought that Lu Tingxiao was here to talk to him.</p><br/><p>However, the man did not even look at him, he focused on the girl opposite him with a gentle gaze and a doting tone, \"We\u2019ll go back together later.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded with a big smile. \"Okay!\"</p><br/><p>This short conversation was impactful enough to give Wang Shengzhe a good fright.</p><br/><p>This...the both of them...what was happening\u2026?</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026?</p><br/><p>\"Well...CEO Lu, you...I\u2026\" As Wang Shengzhe realized what their relationship was, his soul almost left him. He just stared at the man blindly.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao glanced at him murderously, then left without saying a word.</p><br/><p>Although it was just a short glance, Wang Shengzhe felt like he had experienced a brief moment of death\u2026</p><br/><p>After Lu Tingxiao left, Wang Shengzhe looked at Ning Xi. \"Y-you...and Lu Tingxiao\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

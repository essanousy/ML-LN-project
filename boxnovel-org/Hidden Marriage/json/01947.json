Moreover, this was just an audition for a minor role.</p><br/><p>The assistant director seemed polite when he saw Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Ning Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs the rumor says, you really are an Oriental beauty.\u201d His eyes shone. Apparently, he had a positive first impression of Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>If they had not promised to work with Starlight, he might have chosen this one in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director nodded with a complex expression on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s all. You can go back and wait for the confirmation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Short as expected.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, there was still a chance given the assistant director\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi left, a discussion sparked inside the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d The assistant director asked the others.</p><br/><p>One of them said, \u201cThe vibe Ms. Ning Xi gave off was outstanding. Her popularity is on par with Han Zixuan\u2019s in China, but as far as I know, she just came back after a year of retirement. She doesn\u2019t really have many resources on hand, and her future progression is unpredictable. I think using Han Zixuan is the safer choice!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other person disagreed. \u201cOn par? Mike, Ms. Ning Xi is a truly capable person! You should see her in \u2018Mother\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDwight, just to be clear, this role doesn\u2019t need capabilities. It isn\u2019t even related to the actor itself. We just need popularity and strong backup! That\u2019s how we can maximize the profit from the Chinese population!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlory World Entertainment has been taken back by the Lu Corporation, their potential is still unknown! Mike, you\u2019re jumping to conclusions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it yourself that it\u2019s unknown. We don\u2019t need to take risks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone somewhat expected it when they saw that Ning Xi\u2019s audition ended swiftly too. Many of them looked at her with a sense of rejoice in her misfortune.</p><br/><p>They finally saw the results, and people started to leave.</p><br/><p>In the meantime, the assistant director was having a headache as the duo argued in front of him.</p><br/><p>If they could not work this out, they could just send the audition videos back and let the higher-ups decide.</p><br/><p>Their audition processes were all live-streamed to the higher-ups, but those people might not even watch it immediately, or they may not even care.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Chinese staff rushed into the room and asked the assistant director, \u201cDirector, where\u2019s Ms. Ning Xi from earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe just left. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d The assistant director seemed confused.</p><br/><p>The lady staff looked flustered. \u201cJace\u2026 Mr. Jace wants to see her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Mr. Jace wants to see her personally?\u201d The assistant director shot to his feet in shock.</p><br/><p>The pair beside him looked like they had just witnessed a supernatural occurrence.</p></div>\n</div>"}

On such a hot summer day, it made everyone feel even hotter.</p><br/><p>While Ning Xi held onto a card, feeling like she was about to faint.</p><br/><p>A row of words was written on the card: \u2018Remember to come pick me up at the airport~ \u2013Corrupted Devil King\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning, please sign off on the delivery.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll sign off on your sister!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take it all back, it\u2019ll affect everyone\u2019s work piled up here!\u201d Ning Xi tried her best to keep a gentle tone as she rejected the gift.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do that, we promised our customer that we can only go once we\u2019ve watched you sign on the receipt!\u201d The flower boy was troubled.</p><br/><p>At this moment, one of the prop directors hurriedly tried to persuade her, \u201cNing Xi, just accept them, just accept them! Coincidentally, we have a scene that needs roses later on, so we won\u2019t need to spend so much effort to prepare them if you give them to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the prop director had already said so, Ning Xi could not bear to trouble the delivery boy any longer. She pinched the space between her eyebrows, then messily signed her own name.</p><br/><p>By this point, everyone watching from the side started whispering amongst themselves with envy on their faces:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy gosh! There are so many roses! It\u2019s so romantic! Who sent them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even need to ask? It definitely has to be a suitor! Beautiful women are really treated differently, to think that someone sent flowers on the first day of filming! And they sent so many!\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant by Ning Xueluo\u2019s side, Cui Caijing, said carelessly, \u201cAlthough there are so many of them, it doesn\u2019t actually cost much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she said so, someone suddenly came over looking for Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t so eye-catching this time as the new arrival carefully passed her a small box.</p><br/><p>All the busybodies stretched their heads over trying to peek, what was it this time?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s face was full of suspicion as she opened it, only to see a huge, sparkling diamond with a note. The note said: \u2018Long time no see.\u2019, and was signed off as \u2018YS\u2019.</p><br/><p>Staring at those two letters, Ning Xi\u2019s expression turned even uglier.</p><br/><p>****! Were they collaborating together on this? She was trying to keep a low profile, why was it so hard?</p><br/><p>In such a short time, she had first gotten fresh flowers and then diamonds. The whole production team was in an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god! That diamond is freaking huge! My eyes are about to go blind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2019s suitors are so crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Cui Caijing had nothing to say, she could only whisper sourly, \u201cWho knows if it\u2019s real or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Ning Xi collapsed in a chair, looking like she couldn\u2019t live on.</p><br/><p>Whatever was supposed to happen, would come eventually\u2026</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t even hide\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a few deep breaths and tried her best to recover her calm, before walking to the director, \u201cMy apologies, Director Guo. I\u2019ve caused trouble for the crew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Qisheng didn\u2019t seem to mind at all, he chuckled as he waved away her apology, \u201cIt\u2019s natural to have a few suitors when you\u2019re such a beautiful lady! There\u2019s nothing to apologise for! We\u2019ve even gotten your flowers for free!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not far away, Ning Xueluo looked calm on the outside, but she was gritting her teeth in irritation.</p><br/><p>How could she not be jealous? That village girl who had still reeked of dirt back then, could actually drive men mad to the point of sending such extravagant gifts and effortlessly get the things she had to work so hard to get\u2026</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of the little time she had before the next scene started, Ning Xi quickly found a corner and dialed a number.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Have you received my present, darling?\u201d A leisurely tone sounded from the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Muye! **** your grandfather! Are you for real?\u201d In contrast, Ning Xi was on fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk. You\u2019re the very first one who\u2019s ever refused to **** me after receiving my roses, and you even want to **** my grandfather! Aren\u2019t your tastes too weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop changing the topic! What do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, I just wanted to remind you to come pick me up at the airport. You\u2019ve promised me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still dare to let me pick you up? Aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll bring a 40m knife and chop you to death with it, you bastard?\u201d Ning Xi strongly suppressed her killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going back on your word?\u201d The person\u2019s tone turned cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe condition for going to pick you up was that you would lend me 8 million, but now I don\u2019t need it. Didn\u2019t I send you a text explaining that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care anyway, you\u2019ve already promised me. Although I didn\u2019t lend you the money in the end, but I agreed the moment you asked, even though it was such a huge sum. How could that be fake? Don\u2019t you hate owing people the most? Doesn\u2019t this still count as a favour?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

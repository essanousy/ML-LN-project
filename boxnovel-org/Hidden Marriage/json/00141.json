You\u2019re the one who needs to watch out, Lu Tingxiao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I need to watch out for?\u201d Lu Tingxiao was puzzled.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spoke as if it was obvious, \u201cObviously I\u2019m the one you need to look out for! After soaking for a while, I\u2019ve almost recovered all of my strength, but the dormant volcano hidden inside my body still feels as though it may erupt at any time! Therefore, in a situation like this, you should keep your distance from me! There will be serious consequences if I succumb to my beastly instincts! Let me tell you, when I go crazy, even I\u2019m scared of myself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Lu Tingxiao\u2019s mouth lifted slightly. After hearing her exaggerated words, he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>In truth, he was actually hoping for something like that to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe medicine has been brought over. Do you need my help?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. For the sake of your chastity, it\u2019s better that I apply it myself!\u201d Ning Xi spoke with vigour.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy chastity\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao frowned.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi winked, \u201cIn the past, didn\u2019t you say that you would only have sexual relations with someone after marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>An upstanding and self-respecting man like him with a strong sense of values was truly like a needle in a haystack. Breaking his principles would be much too sinful.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pinched the bridge of his nose. Was it still possible to take back those words right now?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued hesitantly, \u201cAbout that, I\u2019m not wearing any clothing underneath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded and handed her the medicine. Then, he took the initiative to leave, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSounds good. Oh, right! Along the way, please help me check to see if my clothing, purse, and so on are out there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao walked into the living room. After looking around for a short while, he discovered a clothing hamper in the corner. All of Ning Xi\u2019s personal belongings were inside.</p><br/><p>A light lit up inside her purse. There was an incoming call on her muted phone.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao casually swept a glance over it. A second later, his pupils suddenly shrank.</p><br/><p>Two distinct letters had popped up on the caller id \u2014\u2014YS</p><br/><p>It was actually that person whose identity he was still unable to uncover.</p><br/><p>The call didn\u2019t cut off and the screen continued to flash.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stared for more than ten seconds. In the end, he used his slender finger to pick up the phone and accept the call.</p><br/><p>On the other end of the phone, there was a sound of trickling liquid, like someone was pouring wine. Immediately, a husky male voice spoke, \u201cHey Sissy, have you received my present yet? Happy Birthday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Tingxiao didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>After about five seconds, right when Lu Tingxiao had assumed that the other person wouldn\u2019t speak again, the voice that carried a tinge of demonic charm spoke again, \u201cHeh, you\u2019re not Ning Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao remained silent.</p><br/><p>Next, the familiar sound of a wine glass lightly tapping against glass rang out. Following that, the man continued to speak with some intrigue, \u201cThen who are you? Let me guess\u2026 You\u2019re definitely a man\u2026 A man who is with her at this hour\u2026 Are you friends with benefits or currently dating?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man paused and then let out a deep chuckle. His tone held dangerous, hidden malice, \u201cAh, if you guys are dating, then has she told you that she\u2019s having an affair? Yeah, that\u2019s right. Furthermore, I\u2019m the other man.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was he trying to say?</p><br/><p>Just as Lu Tingxiao was going to probe for more information, the cell phone suddenly went black. It had actually run out of battery and turned off on its own.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

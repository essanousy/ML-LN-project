Following that, she turned to Lu Tingxiao with uncertainty and asked, \u201cThis gun\u2026 You\u2019re really giving it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cTake it as your birthday present.\u201d</p><br/><p>This gift was rather special\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi gently stroked the gun, \u201cThank you! I love it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The safety on this gun was indeed much better. Furthermore, it had a low-key appearance and no one would be able to tell what model it was unless they dismantled it. It was much more convenient to use.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued looking at the gun and couldn\u2019t help but feel a little teary, \u201cLu Tingxiao, thank you\u2026 No one has ever been so kind to me before\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao felt slightly touched in his heart. As he was about to say something, Ning Xi spoke with emotion, \u201cIt feels a little like having a father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This\u2026 was a rather high evaluation, but he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already this late, you must be hungry. I\u2019ll make some supper for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ning Xi eagerly ran out, Lu Tingxiao dismantled her old gun without batting an eyelid.</p><br/><p>As he expected, the serial number had been erased.</p><br/><p>However, this narrowed down the list of suspects again.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later, Ning Xi walked back in carrying a steaming bowl of food.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Tingxiao, are dumplings okay? I saw that there were still some remaining in the freezer from the last time we made them, so I heated some up for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how busy Lu Tingxiao was, Ning Xi felt a little sorry for troubling him. Thus, she took up the bowl, \u201cI\u2019ll feed you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s brows furrowed together slightly. He wanted to reject her offer at first, but he couldn\u2019t bear to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feed you, I\u2019ll feed you! Just focus on your work!\u201d Ning Xi hastily picked up a dumpling with a pair of chopsticks and carefully blew on it before sending it to his mouth.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao stared at his laptop screen with a serene expression before opening his mouth and eating that dumpling.</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t it taste this good the last time he ate it?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued feeding the dumplings to him one by one until she finished feeding him the entire bowl.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo take a break, I\u2019m almost done here.\u201d Lu Tingxiao returned Zhang Qiang\u2019s laptop to her and started concentrating on his own laptop.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Ning Xi hugged the laptop and sat on the sofa in the corner.</p><br/><p>Because she was bored, she started looking through Zhang Qiang\u2019s laptop to see if she could find any leads.</p><br/><p>In the end, she actually did find something.</p><br/><p>She found a folder named \u2018Important Secrets\u2019 in the D: drive. Upon opening it, she discovered that there were quite a few videos in the folder.</p><br/><p>Perhaps that guy had hidden some evidence and hadn\u2019t told her?</p><br/><p>While eyeing the screen suspiciously, Ning Xi opened one of the videos.</p><br/><p>Right as she opened it, Ning Xi felt that something wasn\u2019t right. However, when she finally reacted, it was already too late. Heart-pounding moans and groans blasted out from the laptop, sounding extremely clear and distinct in the quiet study\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wanted to dig a hole in the ground and bury herself in it. She kept clicking, but she couldn\u2019t close the video because she was panicking.</p><br/><p>In the end, Lu Tingxiao couldn\u2019t bear watching any longer and walked over to help her close the video.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi threw the laptop away and complained, \u201cHe had some files in a folder named \u2018Important Secrets\u2019, so I thought it was evidence\u2026 Damn! I should have known!\u201d</p><br/><p>Any suspicious folders in a man\u2019s computer would surely be that kind of thing!</p><br/><p>Seeing the girl\u2019s indignant appearance, Lu Tingxiao pinched the space between his brows before sighing with absolute helplessness, \u201cIt\u2019s done, come over and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had told her that he would finish it within one night out of selfishness, hoping that he could spend more time with her.</p><br/><p>However, if this torment continued, he didn\u2019t know what he would do\u2026</p><br/><p>TL Note: After a quick poll yesterday, I\u2019ll be holding three different livestreams this month: translating, reading and Q&amp;A~ I\u2019ll be livestreaming as I translate the latest chapters of EEWC &amp; HM this Sunday, 14th May at 9am (GMT+8) which is 9pm (UTC-5)!

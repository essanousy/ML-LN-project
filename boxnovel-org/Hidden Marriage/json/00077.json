You even dare to play around with Lu Tingxiao, aren\u2019t you afraid that you\u2019ll get burnt playing with fire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to play with fire, what\u2019s it to you?\u201d Ning Xi wasn\u2019t happy about Jiang Muye\u2019s tone, so her attitude wasn\u2019t all too good either.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye was about to storm off, but he finally threw a punch on the pillar behind her, \u201cNing Xi, I\u2019m not trying to alarm you, but I\u2019m just trying to give you a friendly reminder. Otherwise, you won\u2019t even know how you died when the time comes! Don\u2019t you know who Lu Tingxiao is? Did you think he\u2019s the same as those rich boys you dated in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m an idiot? Of course I do!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven knowing that, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what? What\u2019s it to you if you see me sleeping with Lu Tingxiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye slowly calmed down. Actually, he knew in his heart that Ning Xi wasn\u2019t so silly as to do something like that, so he suppressed his rage, took a deep breath and said, \u201cThen tell me, what\u2019s going on with all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi also felt that it was too childish to continue bickering with Jiang Muye, but it was because of this guy\u2019s appearance that had agitated her today. She was rather hot-tempered now, any little thing could set her off.</p><br/><p>Thus, she calmed down and explained, \u201cI saved Little Treasure previously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s expression showed a little surprise, \u201cYou saved Little Treasure? What happened to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf a month ago, Lu Jingli brought Little Treasure to a bar. In order to escape the noisy crowd, he accidentally hid inside a storeroom and got locked in unknowingly by one of the employees\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cBringing Little Treasure to a bar? That does sound like something my irresponsible second uncle would do. And then? What does this have to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was preparing to come to audition for ?Land Under Heaven?, but for the sake of preventing me from going to the audition, Chang Li locked me up in that storeroom\u2026\u201d Ning Xi explained what happened simply.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye listened patiently to the end, \u201cAlright, I understand now. You met Lu Tingxiao because you saved Little Treasure. Then the next step should be the Lu family giving you a sum of money as thanks, then GAME OVER, each of you should have gone your separate ways! Why are you still keeping contact with Lu Tingxiao? You\u2019re even staying at his house!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi omitted the part where Lu Tingxiao had proposed marriage as a reward, \u201cBecause Little Treasure suffered a shock, and I saved him, he\u2019s very reliant on me. Thus Lu Tingxiao requested that I stay at the Lu residence until Little Treasure\u2019s frame of mind stabilises. I\u2019m there to act as Little Treasure\u2019s sedative at any time, do you understand now?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that bit, Jiang Muye\u2019s furious expression had slowly dissipated. However, he still had some complaints. He grumbled, \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all? So many women want to marry into the Lu family, and you\u2019re now the closest one to that goal. Don\u2019t you have any thoughts of overstepping your boundaries with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her brows and said calmly, \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about overstepping boundaries, then I do have thoughts like that towards Little Treasure. He\u2019s simply too cute, I really want to kidnap him and take him home to be my little sweetheart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye glanced at her speechlessly, before holding his forehead and saying, \u201cAnyway, you had best not have any improper thoughts, the rich and powerful families aren\u2019t like what you imagine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sneered, \u201cAnd you know what the rich and powerful families in my imagination are like?\u201d</p><br/><p>She hated the upper class the most, they were all pretending to be polite, each wearing a fake mask\u2026</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy to leave the Ning family, so how could she possibly jump back into the fire?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

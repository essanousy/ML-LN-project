Bam!</p><br/><p>What happened?! Who was that?</p><br/><p>Damn it, he sleeps naked! Was someone going to rape him?</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli's first reaction was to cover himself up with a blanket, then he saw something much worse than a nightmare. Both his parents were standing by his bed looking enraged as if they were going to beat him up any second like they did when he had poked a beehive for fun.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was terrified and any sense of sleepiness vanished altogether. \"Uh...Father, Mother...what are you doing here this early?\"</p><br/><p>\"You bastard! I\u2019m going to kill you!\" Yan Ruyi started attacking him without explaining a thing, Lu Chongshan joining in with his walking stick as well.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli rolled across the bed to evade his parents\u2019 attack. \"Wow! What are you guys doing?! Don\u2019t aim for my face! Am I really your son? Ah, don\u2019t grab my blanket, I\u2019m naked...can we talk after I put on some clothes?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll give you two minutes, come out quickly!\" Yan Ruyi went out with her husband and closed the door. The two of them waited in the living room angrily.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli quickly dressed up, then opened the window\u2026</p><br/><p>He would be a fool to go out there obediently!</p><br/><p>It must have been something terrible for them to bother him this early in the morning!</p><br/><p>Too bad for him, Lu Chongshan expected his little trick and caught him red-handed. \"Bastard, I knew you were going to run away! Come here!\"</p><br/><p>In the end, Lu Jingli could not escape his fate.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli sat on the sofa while scratching his head with a scowl. \"So, what happened?\"</p><br/><p>\"How dare you ask us what happened? You tell us what happened last night! Don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t know!\" Lu Chongshan glared stormily at his son.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli shrugged innocently. \"What happened last night? I organized a party.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t play dumb! Someone told me...told me...that your brother kissed a man in front of everyone! This...this is ridiculous! Absolutely ridiculous!\" Lu Chongshan fumed.</p><br/><p>\"What...so...that's it?\"</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s with that attitude?! This is a serious matter!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli pleaded innocently, \"Please, Father and Mother, it was Brother who kissed a man and not me. He stays just right beside me, so why don't you go and bother him instead of beating me up? This is so unfair!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Chongshan\u2019s face darkened. \"You dare say that it wasn\u2019t your idea? Who else can it be other than you? Of course, I\u2019m going to beat you up!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli complained unhappily, \"What the heck?! Why is it my idea now?! It was Brother\u2019s own will and action! I was shocked as well, I\u2019m a victim too!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Chongshan and Yan Ruyi hesitated when they saw Lu Jingli\u2019s genuine expression.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli then continued, \"And why would you think that it\u2019s fake? It might be possible that my brother really likes men.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Chongshan's rage surged again. \"Nonsense! I\u2019m going to kill you if you keep spouting crap! Your brother already has a son, do you think he would he like a man now? And he practically turned into putty being charmed by that woman before. This must be part of his plans!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

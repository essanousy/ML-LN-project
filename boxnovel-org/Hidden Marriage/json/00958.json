Lu Tingxiao, while she looks cute, she's actually very talented in healing!\"</p><br/><p>Annie was embarrassed. \"I'm not as good as Bro Xi says\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao pulled opened a drawer and took out a yellowish book tied in string. \"I received an ancient book about medical knowledge a few days ago. If you don't mind, please take it as a gift to commemorate our meeting for the first time. Thank you for taking care of Xiao Xi when she was overseas.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's alright, I didn't really do anything. I was the one being taken care of instead! And this...this is too valuable!\" Annie instantly knew that the book was extremely precious and being an original, it must be priceless!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put the book into Annie's hands. \"Just take it, we don't have any use for it anyway and it's not true that you didn't do anything. There were a few times that you took care of me thoroughly when I was injured!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright...I'll take it, thank you.\"</p><br/><p>Annie kept quiet. She felt that there was no more reason for her to stay, she took a deep breath and smiled, \"Bro Xi, I'm really happy meeting you today, I'll be leaving now, it's already late.\"</p><br/><p>\"So soon\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll still be around here for some time, there'd still be chances to meet, as long as Bro Xi doesn't find that I'm too annoying\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao walked her to the first floor. Lu Tingxiao waited in the house while Ning Xi accompanied her to the car. \"Be careful on the road.\"</p><br/><p>\"You know that I always drive like a snail, so I don't go that fast anyway!\" Annie smiled.</p><br/><p>The night was quiet and no one was around.</p><br/><p>Annie held her fists tight, loosened them and then tightened them again. She then looked up and said in a trembling voice, \"Bro Xi, are you really not coming back?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sighed and gave her a hug. \"Annie, everyone has their own lives. I have mine and you have yours. You'll be fine on your own, you don't have to miss me. I'll be fine.\"</p><br/><p>Annie sobbed, \"I admit that I was really worried before I came but...Little Treasure's so cute and Lu Tingxiao's really nice as well...Bro Xi, I wish you happiness! I think saying anything else would be futile.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, I will!\"</p><br/><p>After saying goodbye to Ning Xi, Annie waved farewell and started her car engine.</p><br/><p>The car slowly left the apartment. From the rearview mirror, she saw the man put a thick coat on the girl as the girl smiled at him. They chatted and held each other's hand as they went back up\u2026</p><br/><p>Bro Xi was doing well. Really well. She had someone she loved, her dream, her career...She was doing much better than before.</p><br/><p>Why should she make her return?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As they went back upstairs, Ning Xi hugged Lu Tingxiao and thanked him, \"Thank you, Boss!\"</p><br/><p>\"What's that for?\" Lu Tingxiao leaned his back on the door.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked up at him. \"Thank you for treating my friend so well. You know...she's from that side, don't you?\"</p><br/><p>\"All I know is that she's someone you care about,\" Lu Tingxiao simply replied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

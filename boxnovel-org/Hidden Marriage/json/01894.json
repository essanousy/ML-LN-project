I'm here!\" Ning Xi took off her mask the moment the door shut. She happily hopped towards Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\"You're here\u2026\" Lu Tingxiao looked up from the document he was working on when he heard the girl's voice.</p><br/><p>The next moment, he was taken aback when he saw the girl's appearance. His clear eyes suddenly turned dark.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was wearing a school uniform. If he was not mistaken, it was the uniform of Imperial University. Lu Jingli had shown it to him before on a magazine as a reference to their company uniform but he had rejected it, so he had a vague impression of it.</p><br/><p>The girl was wearing the uniform skirt with her hair pulled into a ponytail. She did not put on any makeup, yet she looked very beautiful. Her cherry lips, her smooth skin, and her current appearance did not look like a person who had been in the entertainment industry for a very long time. She looked just like a chaste university student.</p><br/><p>\"Darling, I want a hug!\" Since Ning Xi had been disgusted by a jerk just now, she viewed Lu Tingxiao as a cleansing spring. She went past the table and snuggled over.</p><br/><p>Before Lu Tingxiao could react, the girl was already in his arms.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sat on the man's lap and embraced her fresh sense of security, rubbing her head against the man's chin.</p><br/><p>The man carefully hugged the precious girl in his arms. He gently patted the girl's head and asked, \"Why are you dressed like this?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi then realized she was still wearing the school uniform, then she scratched her head. \"Ah... because I went to Imperial University just now to see Xiao Nuo, I had Xu Tao find me something that wouldn't attract attention. Then, he took a uniform out from nowhere!\"</p><br/><p>No wonder Cheng Feng and several other workers had been staring at her weirdly when she arrived!</p><br/><p>Ugh, did they think she was trying to seduce Lu Tingxiao with some schoolgirl roleplay?</p><br/><p>Sadly, she had not done it on purpose!</p><br/><p>Well, she could do it on purpose as well\u2026</p><br/><p>The girl let her lids fall heavily as she closed in. \"Darling, do I look good like this?\"</p><br/><p>The man's eyes turned darker. \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>The girl was satisfied. \"Hehe! I wasn't kidding when I said you got yourself a treasure after you marry me! I wasn't lying when I said that I'll have you change your wife every day!\"</p><br/><p>The girl continued wiggling around on him and Lu Tingxiao seemed like he was having a tough time. \"Be good. Go over to the sofa and wait for a while. I'll be done soon.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked disappointed. \"Can't I sit here while you do your thing?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked even more unhappy now. \"Then, I won't bother you! I'll stop talking!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao helplessly pinched the space between his eyebrows when he looked at his wife. After a while, he sighed and guided her hand and drew it southwards\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked her eyes, unsure about what was happening. In the next moment, her eyes flew wide as she felt a hard warmth\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao kissed the girl's neck and said in his hoarse voice, \"I'll get distracted.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

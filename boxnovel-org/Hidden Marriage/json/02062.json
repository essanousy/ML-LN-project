Someone kicked the door in.</p><br/><p>A group of big and muscular American men in black sleeveless shirts came into the shop. They surrounded Ning Xi\u2019s table and then yelled fiercely at others, \u201cAll you unrelated people, get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>They held guns and the other customers all left screaming while the staff hid under the tables.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had a chicken wing in her hand. She blinked her eyes and looked at them. \u201cR-Robbery?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Lang was eating an ice cream. \u201cOf course not, they are here for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcept this woman, all of you get lost! Don\u2019t butt into this! If not, don\u2019t blame me if you\u2019re hurt!\u201d The man who looked like the leader had a skull necklace around his neck. He kicked a nearby chair away and threatened them.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang licked his ice cream while Feng Xiaoxiao put on an eerie smile. Tang Ye just sat there emotionlessly, and Han Xiao was still focused on eating, not even looking up.</p><br/><p>Their reactions angered the guy. \u201cMessy hair! Yellow pig! Weakling! And you, sissy! I\u2019m talking to you guys! Did you hear me! Do you want to die?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Messy hair Tang Lang, yellow pig Feng Xiaoxiao, weakling Tang Ye, and sissy Han Xiao were all speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft! Cough\u2026\u201d Ning Xi choked on her cola and started coughing.</p><br/><p><em>Damn\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>You\u2019re really tough, bro. You just offended four gods of death\u2026</em></p><br/><p>The atmosphere around the table changed the moment the man said those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cMessy hair\u2026\u201d Tang Lang touched his curly hair that he was proud of. His eyes were as sharp as knives at the moment.</p><br/><p>A cold light glinted off Tang Ye\u2019s gold-framed glasses.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoxiao slammed the table hard. \u201cWhat the heck did you say just now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xiao was the most relaxed one. He was focused on eating his second family bucket.</p><br/><p>The man looked ferocious as his bloodlust had become stronger. \u201cSince all of you are asking for it, don\u2019t blame me for not warning you guys! Get them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi ducked beside the Master, then she covered her eyes.</p><br/><p>Probably because Tang Lang seemed annoying, the man attacked Tang Lang first.</p><br/><p>Tang Lang did not move an inch until a punch swooshed right before his forehead, then he grabbed it tightly with his palm.</p><br/><p>A terrifying bone-crushing sound came from under his knuckle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d The man roared painfully.</p><br/><p>On Tang Ye\u2019s side, the others attacked him because he wore a pair of glasses and looked weak. The end result was so bloody that Ning Xi did not even want to glance at it.</p><br/><p>Screams came from all over the shop. It was chaotic hell.</p><br/><p>The group of men knelt on the floor and begged for mercy desperately. The man with the skull necklace was kicked far away by Tang Lang, but Feng Xiaoxiao received him and kicked him back. The man was being played like a football.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shook her head.</p><br/><p>These people\u2026 Could they be idiots?</p><br/><p>They were just like a bunch of juicy sheep walking right into the wolves\u2019 den\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Didn\u2019t I say that there\u2019s no need to pick me up?\u201d Ning Xueluo skipped over to the man happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop worrying since it started raining outside.\u201d Su Yan took off his jacket and put it on her. He looked at her unhappily, \u201cWhy are you wearing so little?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo had a sweet expression on her face, \u201cOh you, I\u2019m already a grown woman! Why are you still treating me like a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi leaned against the icy cold wall with uneven steps. She felt that she was really unlucky today.</p><br/><p>For the whole night, she had been treated to Ning Xueluo\u2019s show of parental affection, and now it was a lovey-dovey scene.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo was completely showing off everything she had taken away from her\u2026</p><br/><p>Not satisfied with just making her watch, Ning Xueluo hugged Su Yan\u2019s arm and purposely walked towards her. She said warmly, \u201cLittle junior, you seem to be quite drunk. Why don\u2019t you join us? I\u2019ll let my boyfriend send you home!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo deliberately emphasised the word \u2018boyfriend\u2019.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Su Yan finally noticed Ning Xi. His pupils abruptly tightened upon seeing her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>It had been a long time.</p><br/><p>In the years she had been overseas, he had not seen her even once. Even after she had returned, he had only seen her a few times from afar when he went to pick Xueluo up at the company.</p><br/><p>He was caught off guard by seeing her up close. She was so different that he almost couldn\u2019t recognise her.</p><br/><p>The little girl who had worn braids and a flowery skirt back then, had blossomed into a woman who could move any man\u2019s heart without his knowing\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing that Su Yan was looking at Ning Xi dazedly, a dark emotion flashed across Ning Xueluo\u2019s eyes. She grabbed his arm and shook it, \u201cSu-gege, what do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan suddenly regained his senses and nodded hastily, \u201cYes, let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Ning\u2026 Junior Ning? Are you okay?\u201d Ning Xueluo showed a caring expression.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pressed on her forehead with the back of her hand. Her mind was growing more and more hazy under the influence of alcohol. Her heart was beating faster and her blood was almost rushing backwards. It was as if there was a beast roaring inside her body, struggling to break free so that it could tear up the two pretentious masks in front of her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need\u2026\u201d Ning Xi turned and stumbled towards the restroom before she completely lost control.</p><br/><p>Watching Ning Xi\u2019s sorry figure escape, Ning Xueluo finally let out a refreshed smile. However, her expression immediately changed into an extremely sad one when she turned towards Su Yan, \u201cSu-gege, I think Xiao Xi isn\u2019t willing to forgive me\u2026 I\u2019m already trying my best to make it up to her\u2026 I\u2019ve been doing whatever I can to help her in the company, but she\u2019s still like this. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it! Xiao Xi\u2019s personality is like that, she\u2019ll forgive you when time passes!\u201d Su Yan reassured her softly.</p><br/><p>At the ground floor of the hotel, a group of girls from the crew were excitedly discussing the sports car Su Yan had driven in on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just searched online and I found out that this Maserati is at least 100 million yuan! He\u2019s way too rich!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to find a rich boyfriend too, how many years will it take till I can find one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost importantly, he\u2019s so handsome! There are so many stars who married someone rich, but they\u2019re all pot-bellied middle-aged men\u2026 Just looking at them makes my stomach churn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>As they were gossiping, they spotted Su Yan and Ning Xueluo walking towards them from the hotel.</p><br/><p>The picture of a handsome man and a beautiful woman standing together was simply a feast for the eyes.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked on enviously as Ning Xueluo entered that sports car, still wearing Su Yan\u2019s jacket. They waited until they could no longer see the car before sighing\u2026</p><br/><p>Not long after that car had left, the roar of an engine could be heard heading towards them. Following that, a silvery white sports car zoomed past them and came to a stop in front of the hotel.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, this car\u2026</p><br/><p>This car was too damn outstanding!</p><br/><p>That handsome low chassis, smooth body and cool scissor doors gave off the feeling of a masterpiece\u2026</p><br/><p>Most importantly, the price\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the, that\u2019s the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, the world\u2019s most expensive supercar\u2026 It costs over a billion yuan at the very least\u2026 My god\u2026 which god of wealth has arrived\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>TL Note: The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport apparently costs USD1.4 million o.o</p><br/>\n</div>"}

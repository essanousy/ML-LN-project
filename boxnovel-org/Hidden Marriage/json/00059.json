On the contrary, because she\u2019d done too well, people actually believed even more that she was a bewitching vixen. They didn\u2019t even think this was acting, but just an unveiling of her true personality.</p><br/><p>The director was worried that her emotional state would be unstable and ran over to comfort her before she left. \u201cNing Xi, don\u2019t worry, your male lead will be joining the cast next month. The good scenes are yet to come!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled wryly, \u201cDirector, just who is my male lead? You\u2019ve kept a tight lid on it since the start of filming and won\u2019t drop a hint at all. It\u2019s one thing not to tell the media in order to build up some suspense, but why won\u2019t you tell us either?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say it, what if you guys let it leak? All I can say that the second male lead is a huge star!\u201d Guo Qisheng had a mysterious expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Jia Qingqing was passing by when she caught wind of this and muttered disdainfully, \u201cFor a second male lead, what kind of big star could he be? Could he possibly be as famous as screen king Zhao Sizhou? Wouldn\u2019t you say so Xueluo-jie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo smiled and didn\u2019t say anything, obviously also thinking that the director was exaggerating.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi ignored Jia Qingqing\u2019s sarcasm as she stuck herself firmly behind Guo Qisheng. \u201cThen is he handsome? You can tell me that at least, right? The second male lead in the script is so handsome that all the heiresses in the city are willing to feign sickness for him!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had many intimate scenes with the second male lead. Not only did she have to flirt with and tease him, but there were many bed scenes as well. Hugs and kisses were par for the course, so she couldn\u2019t help but be more concerned about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s good looking! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be satisfied! Just don\u2019t faint with emotion when you see him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously? Don\u2019t lie to me Director Guo! I\u2019d believe it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>The days passed swiftly, and it was August in the blink of an eye. It\u2019d been two weeks since she\u2019d taken up residence in the Lu residence. Her relations with Little Treasure were becoming better and better, and filming progress was satisfactory.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo and Jia Qingqing had formed an alliance. They would get up to some tricks every now and then. Although Ning Xi saw through them all, it was still too tiring to be on her guard all the time. She was preparing to find the right timing to put things right once and for all.</p><br/><p>It was also a bit odd, she felt like someone seemed to be helping her from the shadows. She received very subtle hints the few times she had overlooked one of the alliance\u2019s tricks. Was it likely that there was someone who couldn\u2019t abide Qia Jingjing\u2019s tyrannical attitude? Ning Xi thought nothing more of it.</p><br/><p>Her biggest headache was needing to pick up a certain irritating fellow at the airport tonight.</p><br/><p>That guy had called her around a dozen times in a row while she was on set today.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi returned to the Lu manor after she wrapped up work for the day. She needed to pick up some gear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back. A nice hotpot place just opened up recently. Let\u2019s go there tonight with Little Treasure?\u201d Lu Tingxiao was reading a newspaper on the couch. He called out to her in a completely natural voice when he saw her return, as if he was talking to his wife.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was a bit shocked by her thoughts. It\u2019d only been half a month, but she was already used to interacting like this with Lu Tingxiao!</p><br/><p>The two of them and Little Treasure, they really did seem like a family of three.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shook her head and dispelled her strange thoughts. She said a bit awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t go tonight. I need to pick someone up at the airport and I won\u2019t be back until late. If Little Treasure wants to eat hotpot, then why don\u2019t you take him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t leave the house if you\u2019re not here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 alright, then let\u2019s go together next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao put down the newspaper and looked at her with a fathomless expression, \u201cPicking up a friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, you could say that\u2026\u201d Ning Xi nodded her head with difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a man or a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Wasn\u2019t this question a little out of bounds?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

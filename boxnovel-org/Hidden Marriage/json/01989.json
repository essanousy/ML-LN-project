Don\u2019t you know who\u2019s in Deer Town?! You just simply asked the higher-ups to assign this mission to us?\u201d Yorick was extremely angry. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste my time on you. Get someone to send over US$ 300 and bear the consequences yourself if something goes wrong!\u201d U.p..dated by . com</p><br/><p>Yorick then hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>Qiao Yi was confuse. He had no idea why Yorick was so angry.</p><br/><p>What was with that US$ 300?</p><br/><p>Moreover, the forces of the European King had issued this order. How was that related to him?</p><br/><p>No matter what, Qiao Yi was not an idiot. If \u201cDoctor Death\u201d and Yorick were not able to finish the job, Lu Tingxiao might indeed have someone incredibly strong there.</p><br/><p>\u201cMight we need to use that person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Jin frowned while Qiao Yi remained silent.</p><br/><p>The person Feng Jin mentioned was not well-known. Still, he was the strongest assassin in the European King\u2019s force. It was not an exaggeration to call him the best in the world.</p><br/><p>Qiao Yi contacted the European King\u2019s force once again and requested them to send someone stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cQiao Yi, do you mean you want us to use Xiao Zhan?\u201d Asked a low and deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Xiao Zhan is willing to, then there\u2019ll be no problem.\u201dQiao Yi smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know that Xiao Zhan tried to assassinate Han Xiao the last time and was injured? He\u2019s currently still recovering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Xiao?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Yi was taken aback when he heard the name Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>While he had never seen him before, he was well aware of Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>Several years back, the European King had betrothed his youngest daughter to Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>However, Han Xiao did not want to get married, so his relationship with the European King broke down.</p><br/><p>Over the years, the European King had sent dozens and dozens of assassins to kill Han Xiao, yet none of them were able to come back alive.</p><br/><p>Qiao Yi had heard some news about Han Xiao as well.</p><br/><p>It was said that he was a genius from a renowned family, and that he was so strong that common sense did not apply to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Zhan\u2026 survived?\u201d Qiao Yi asked.</p><br/><p>In Qiao Yi\u2019s mind, Han Xiao was equivalent to the word \u201cinvincible\u201d.</p><br/><p>Probably only the legendary Qin Wentian would be able to have a fair fight with Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>People of their calibre only existed in legends. No matter how strong Xiao Zhan was, he was still not at their level.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a little more and Han Xiao would have been dead! Too bad\u2026\u201d There was the sigh of a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan\u2019s assassination skills were top of the world; even Han Xiao almost got done in.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Zhan is incredible\u2026\u201d Qiao Yi lamented.</p><br/><p>Just a little bit more and he could have killed Han Xiao! What a miracle! Even though he failed, he was still able to injure Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cQiao Yi, let me tell you, Yorick called me just now. Do you know who\u2019s guarding the Lu family right now?\u201d The other side of the phone asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Qiao Yi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Xiao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Qiao Yi gasped.</p><br/><p>The person in Deer Town was Han Xiao?!</p><br/><p>How was that even possible?!</p><br/><p>Just what kind of relationship did Han Xiao have with Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi? Why would he be helping Ning Xi in Deer Town?!</p><br/><p>Qiao Yi had no idea that Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi knew Han Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how powerful your assassins are, it\u2019s all futile. Even the top killer of the Original Sins, Li Suifeng, was killed by Han Xiao effortlessly. It\u2019s no wonder Yorick would complain about it. We\u2019ll let Xiao Zhan go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Qiao Yi had a chance to speak, the call was hung up.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Let me ask you. If you entered a room and you saw the person you like fed with an aphrodisiac and wearing transparent pajamas while lying on a king-sized bed full of red flower petals, what would you make her do?\"</p><br/><p>She asked Jiang Muye the same question as well.</p><br/><p>\"Make love,\" Yun Shen simply replied.</p><br/><p>Make...love...</p><br/><p>Good...this reply was as expected of Satan. How creepy\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi's mouth twitched and she rolled her eyes. \"But Lu Tingxiao did not do anything! That's the difference between the both of you! And this is why I choose him! He'll never take advantage of me when I'm at my worst! Yun Shen, you don't know what love is!\"</p><br/><p>The man looked annoyed. \"Are you sure this is love and not sexual dysfunction?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi yelled at him in anger, \"Shut up! You're the one with sexual dysfunction!\"</p><br/><p>The man grinned. \"Do you really want to try me?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't have time to play games with you! Let me tell you something, it's alright to have low EQ, you can learn! I can teach you something right now! For example, under this situation, you should learn from Lu Tingxiao and let me go like a gentleman!\" Ning Xi tried to convince him.</p><br/><p>The man raised his eyebrows. \"I don't do what others do.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi clenched her teeth so hard that they almost shattered. Her brain cells were dying while her mouth was running dry. This bastard was too annoying!</p><br/><p>\"Is there anything else you'd like to say?\" The man asked cheerfully as he looked at her whilst enjoying her expression.</p><br/><p>\"Bastard!\"</p><br/><p>Saying anything else to him would be useless anyway.</p><br/><p>\"Are you scolding me?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi kept quiet.</p><br/><p>Finally, he understood why she was scolding him! Could he improve in other aspects as well?</p><br/><p>\"My dear, I'm asking for you to come back to me for your own good...if you continue to be with him, you'll be really sad!\" the man said.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him. \"Why would I be sad?\"</p><br/><p>\"Because you'll become a widow!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" Ning Xi was so angry that she started to feel pain in her bones. \"Don't you talk so big. I don't care what business you have with Lu Tingxiao, but my man isn't someone who can go down that easily!\"</p><br/><p>\"Your man\u2026!?\" Yun Shen's carefree expression suddenly darkened. \"My dear, you really know how to make me angry!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi knew that things were bad when she realized his change in expression. She should not have triggered him, but she really could not help it just now\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open from the outside.</p><br/><p>Tang Ye stood there with a worried expression on his face as he looked over to Ning Xi's direction. He shouted loudly, \"Satan! We're surrounded by Lu Tingxiao's men!\"</p><br/><p>The moment Tang Ye said those words, dust started to form a cloud outside the house as the trees and grass swayed. There was a loud whirring sound from a chopper overhead\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Do you want to die?\" Hong Bin's underlings looked at the entrance.</p><br/><p>There was a cute lady there, dressed in really plain clothes and pigtails. She looked weak, but her expression said otherwise.</p><br/><p>\"Sis\u2026\" Tang Nuo then remembered he had brought Ning Xi here. He quickly went over to shield Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>When Tang Shan and Sun Lan heard Tang Nuo call out for his sister, they looked over.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Nuo, what did you say? Xueluo's here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Xueluo?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When they saw who it was by the door, they were shocked.</p><br/><p>It was not Xueluo\u2026</p><br/><p>It was\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>It was Xiao Xi!</p><br/><p>Why was Xiao Xi here?</p><br/><p>Did Xiao Nuo not look for Xueluo?</p><br/><p>Hong Bin wiped the blood off his face and looked extremely hateful. \"You're Tang Shan's daughter? Do you know who I am? How dare you hurt me?!\"</p><br/><p>His underlings went along. \"You witch, do you want to die!?\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn it, Bro Bin, let's just take the both of them away! This girl looks pretty cute as well!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right! Look at her skin and her face. I don't think anyone looks as attractive as her around here. I didn't know Tang Shan has such a pretty daughter\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Nuo was really incensed listening to them. \"I'll kill you if you dare touch my sister!\"</p><br/><p>Sun Lan did not know why Ning Xi was there. She dragged Tang Nuo back. \"Xiao Nuo, don't be reckless!\"</p><br/><p>\"Get them!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at the time on her watch, seeming impatient.</p><br/><p>After five minutes, those hulking, angry men were all on the ground.</p><br/><p>The jaws of Tang Shan, Sun Lan, and Tang Nuo all dropped.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stepped on Hong Bin's wrist, making him yell loudly. Her expression only turned gentle when she looked at Tang Nuo. She explained herself, \"If I don't be harsh with them, they might look for trouble again after I leave.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah... Please forgive me! I won't do it again! I'll never look for trouble with Bro Tang again!\" Cold sweat fell from Hong Bin's forehead.</p><br/><p>Although it seemed normal, her way of fighting was all calculated. There would not be any obvious injuries on the surface, but it could make a person suffer in pain for a long time. Not even doctors could detect what was wrong with them. She usually would not use skills like that but this time was an exception.</p><br/><p>\"Just no trouble?\" Ning Xi said coldly.</p><br/><p>\"I'll return the money! Right now!\"</p><br/><p>\"Just the money?\"</p><br/><p>\"And interest! I'll add the interest too!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, they forked out about $ 700,000 and gave them all to Tang Shan. Only then did Ning Xi let them go.</p><br/><p>After Hong Bin's gang left, the house looked a little empty. A total of $ 700,000 in cash was on the table.</p><br/><p>Sun Lan helped Tang Shan up from the floor and they both stared at Ning Xi.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

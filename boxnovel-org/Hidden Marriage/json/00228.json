No releases tomorrow as it\u2019s my birthday (I\u2019m on the east coast of the USA)</p><br/><p>If you\u2019d like to chat with us, we now have a discord. The link is in the contacts.</p><br/><p>__________________________________________________________</p><br/><p>Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh my goodness!</p><br/><p>What is this situation?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s brain, as if invaded by a virus is completely garbled. When she finally awakens from the confusion, her first reaction is to push him away.</p><br/><p>As a result, Lu Ting Xiao tightened his arms around her, his voice in her ear sounds as if he is pitiful, \u201cDon\u2019t move. Please let me hold you for a little while\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d this request, how was she supposed to answer it?</p><br/><p>Damn. In the end, what does Lu Ting Xiao want?</p><br/><p>Although she deliberately avoided him the past two day, she\u2019s been careful to do it in a way that wouldn\u2019t arouse suspicion. Why was he suddenly\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ten seconds passed\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Thirty seconds passed\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A minute passed\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Three minutes passed\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This is past a little while! This\u2026he is taking advantage of the situation!</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ning Xi can\u2019t stand it anymore, Lu Ting Xiao let her go, \u201cSorry, my mistake\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi swallowed, \u201cOkay, all right all right\u201d F***, he almost scared her heart to death, is he finally done?</p><br/><p>Sadly, she couldn\u2019t even say no!</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao looked at the girls disgruntled expression, smiling internally. There is a happy twinkle in his eye that goes undetected. \u201cGood night. Make sure to go to bed early.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, good night. You have a good night\u2026\u201d What about her? She wouldn\u2019t sleep tonight!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The next morning.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, she really didn\u2019t sleep the whole night. Ning Xi had been hiding in bed, and didn\u2019t dare get up.</p><br/><p>Finally, she secretly gave Wan Wan a phone call.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cWan Wan, did your young master go to work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wan Wan: \u201cNo! But the young master has been very busy! From the moment he woke up, the phone has been ringing. His assistant Cheng also hurried over and asked the young master when he wanted to go to work\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the young master still did not go ah! He has just been sitting downstairs! I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s waiting for\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems I won\u2019t be able to hide!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took several deep breaths, adjusted her mental state, and placed an indestructible mask of calmness before heading downstairs.</p><br/><p>She saw Lu Ting Xiao sitting on one side of the sofa. The other side, assistant Cheng is holding a lot of files towards Lu Ting Xiao, but he didn\u2019t dare appear to be forcing Lu Ting Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stretched lazily while walking down the steps. When she saw that Lu Ting Xiao was downstairs, she deliberately looked surprised. \u201cHey Lu Ting, it\u2019s this late already. How come you are not going to work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao hearing her voice, lifted his eyes and gently looked at her as if wrapping her in a ball of yarn\u2026..\u201dI was waiting for you\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s face fell slack, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How did she suddenly find herself with no way to reply to Lu Ting Xiao.</p><br/><p>Just as Ning Xi is still baffled, Lu Ting Xiao started walking towards her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi wanted to reflexively go back and hide, but the man\u2019s eyes were like an invisible force that held her in place, making her unable to move.</p><br/><p>A moment passed, and Lu Ting Xiao is standing in front of her, his large palm touching her hair.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cIf I left now, I wouldn\u2019t see you all day\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi continued to look blankly, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to work\u201d Lu Ting Xiao said, leaning forward and placing a kiss on her forehead.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d She completely crashed.</p><br/><p>Behind them, Assistant Cheng Feng looks like a dog\u2019s stunned expression, then blushing, he turned his face away from her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

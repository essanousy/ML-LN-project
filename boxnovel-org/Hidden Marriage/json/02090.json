She could not believe it. Ning Yaohua was shocked as well. He could not believe the girl in front of him right now was Ning Xueluo, the sweet and obedient daughter of theirs.</p><br/><p>He could not believe that she had been harboring thoughts like those!</p><br/><p>\u201cG-gosh\u2026\u201d No one expected such a twist and they were all stunned.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s child was not harmed by someone else. It had been killed by her filial daughter, Ning Xueluo.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she had driven the motorbike herself, almost killing the mother who had been treating her like a real daughter for the past twenty-odd years.</p><br/><p>She was just a daughter of a village woman, who got to enjoy all the privileges over the years because of a mistake. These were all not hers to begin with. Without the Ning family, she would just be another ordinary girl from a rural area, yet she took everything from the Ning family for granted. She felt that everything from the Ning family should be hers.</p><br/><p>Just because Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s son might take the inheritance away from her, she had killed the child.</p><br/><p>What was really scary was that she had been taking on the role of the victim, even trying to blame everything on Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Everyone felt chills run down their spine.</p><br/><p>This woman had tricked everyone. Just how cunning could she be?</p><br/><p>How terrifying!</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua was shocked to his core. He was very enraged by Ning Xueluo\u2019s ridiculous reasoning. \u201cYou monster! The Ning family took care of you for twenty over years. We\u2019ve never asked for your gratitude, yet you repay us with such evil behavior!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo cackled as if she had just heard a joke. \u201cHaha, gratitude? What should I be thankful for? I got everything I had today because of myself! And just what did Ning Xi do!? She just has some blood of the Ning family inside her. She didn\u2019t even do anything and this old geezer gave her 10% of shares. I didn\u2019t even get any!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Yaohua yelled at her, \u201cBut I\u2019ve transferred all the shares I have to you! You already have 20% in your hands. Are you not satisfied!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo laughed sarcastically, \u201cPresident Ning, don\u2019t make it sound so kind. The reason you gave me the shares was all for the marriage with the Su family. Could you really say that you\u2019d still give them to me if you had a son?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you killed your mother\u2019s child!?\u201d Ning Yaohua shrieked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo did not have any sense of remorse in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me when you\u2019re forcing me into a corner! This child should have never existed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stood aside watching the three of them attacking each other.</p><br/><p>She then interrupted, \u201cSorry to interrupt, but I\u2019d like to ask Ms. Ning, did you\u2026 really do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo glared at Ning Xi. \u201cStop pretending you don\u2019t know already, Ning Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put up an innocent expression. \u201cBut I really did fake the video. The place where you destroyed the evidence had no security cameras at all, don\u2019t you know? I asked the special effects artist from the \u2018Thunderbolt Secret Service Squad\u2019 to help me remake the scene. It\u2019s pretty rough around the edges, so I didn\u2019t expect you to believe it\u2026 Oh right, the fingerprints and blood samples\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi glanced at Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>He opened the brown folder and there was no evidence inside. It was all\u2026 pictures of a wedding in a cathedral\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

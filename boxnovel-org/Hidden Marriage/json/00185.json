It would be a pain to explain so Ning Xi didn\u2019t waste her breath. \u201cAuntie, give me one fish!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlrighty!\u201d The auntie used the scale in a very honest manner and even gave Ning Xi quite the discount.</p><br/><p>After selling the fish, that auntie looked at the man standing next to Ning Xi, carrying a child, \u201cMissus, you\u2019re so lucky! Your husband and son are both so handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was standing in a wet market, holding a kid in his arms, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s bearing remained as extraordinary as ever. It must be some sort of innate talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, is that really so? But I\u2019m really handsome as well!\u201d Ning Xi joked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes. You\u2019re all handsome! Especially this little darling of yours. He really makes people want to spoil him! He\u2019s completely inherited all of your best traits, and your husband\u2019s as well! Come, I\u2019ll give you a smaller fish as a free gift!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi subconsciously touched her face. He had inherited the best of her and Lu Tingxiao?</p><br/><p>It seemed like this wasn\u2019t the first time she had heard something like this\u2026</p><br/><p>Following that, Ning Xi, Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure practically turned into the focal points of the wet market. No matter where they went shopping, all the shop owners would gift them something. Green onions, garlic, eggs, fish, and shrimp, they got a little bit of everything. Ning Xi\u2019s basket was almost filled to the brim.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt like she had just discovered a new method to get rich. She spoke with excitement, \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that we\u2019d get so many benefits just by bringing Little Treasure along! Let\u2019s bring Little Treasure next time too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure nodded a few times.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao: \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, the three returned home in triumph.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was in a great mood on the way back. When they were halfway there, she suddenly recalled something and shouted, \u201cLu Tingxiao, do you know where my apartment building is? Turn left at the next intersection!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do. Do you want to go back?\u201d Lu Tingxiao drove the car to her apartment building with familiar ease, even though he had only come by once before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, yup. I\u2019m going to grab my super secret spice mix! Wait a moment for me, you two!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi ran into the apartment building, she quickly grabbed the spice mix and came back down. When she passed by the lobby, the young lady at the front desk urgently stopped her, \u201cHey! Wait! Aren\u2019t you Ning Xi? You have two express deliveries, they\u2019ve been left here for quite a few days. Do you still want them?\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, she sized up Ning Xi without restraint as if seeking something to gossip about. She thought that Ning Xi had probably become a kept woman a while ago since she hadn\u2019t returned for so long,\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Ning Xi didn\u2019t notice the young lady\u2019s measuring gaze. She simply grabbed the two boxes and walked out.</p><br/><p>When she walked to the entrance, she could see that Little Treasure was leaning against the window waiting anxiously, even from a distance.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s gaze turned warm. A second later, three men wearing black suddenly barged into her sight. With just a single glance, she could tell that they had come with ill intentions and they were charging straight towards her\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes flashed with trained vigilance. She immediately set down the objects in her hands and ripped apart her skirt with force. Next, she directed a kick at one of the men who had charged over.</p><br/><p>That person had completely let down his guard, so the kick sent his entire body flying into the air. The two men next to him stared blankly for a good moment before recovering their senses. Their expressions turned vicious as they rushed to attack her even more ferociously\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s outfit today was too ladylike so all of her movements were restrained. She couldn\u2019t settle those two immediately.</p><br/><p>While she was fighting with the two men, another man charged over from behind her. He trapped her arm with his hand and tried to use a rope to tie her up.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was about to strike back when that man suddenly released her arm and let out a bloodcurdling scream.</p><br/><p>She could even hear a cracking sound as the man\u2019s arm broke\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s gaze moved along that person\u2019s arm, only to see that Lu Tingxiao had rushed over from the car at some point in time and was currently wearing a frosty expression. He was emitting a murderous aura and his hand was exerting some strength as he gripped that person\u2019s wrist steadily\u2026</p><br/><p>TL Note: This is the last translated chapter of HM.</p><br/><p>Thank you once again for reading Hidden Marriage! &gt;w&lt;</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll be taking a short break and working on summaries before I start posting them. The raws for HM are currently at chapter 1746 as of today, and I\u2019ll be summarising up to the last available chapter on the day I finish the last summary.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s going to take a while to finish these summaries. I have to read 50 chapters in Chinese and pick out the important points to summarise, which takes much longer than translating 1 chapter. There\u2019ll be about 33 summaries posted, and I\u2019ll try to post at least 1 or 2 summaries every week! I\u2019ll also make an announcement post as usual when I post summaries, so you can check the volare home page for updates~</p><br/><p>I hope to have the first summary out by next week! In the meantime, try reading some of the new short stories I just translated!</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll be focusing on writing the summaries while searching for a new novel. When I do find one, it\u2019ll be launched here on volare, hopefully in late June or at the start of July! :3</p><br/>\n</div>"}

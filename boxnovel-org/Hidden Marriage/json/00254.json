I\u2019m not stupid! I\u2019m hanging up! My assistant is still waiting for me!\u201d Ning Xi quickly hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>This was a sad reminder! Sure enough, she should avoid having any contact with Lu Ting Xiao!</p><br/><p>When Ning Xi got off the phone, Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s face still had a smile that had not subsided. Feeling glad, suddenly a big face got in his way, whining with a tone full of resentment, \u201cBrother~ be honest~~~ are you hiding anything from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao did not deny it and simply raised a brow, \u201cIs it very obvious?\u201d</p><br/><p>His reply gave Lu Jingli a severe blow, and he dramatically fell to the ground and rolled, \u201cOw! You really are hiding something from me! I am your brother, your most competent lieutenant, your little jacket (right hand man)! You actually dare hide something from me and not tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t guess it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019ll guess, I\u2019ll guess!\u201d Lu Jingli hopped back up and began pacing back and forth. Three minutes later, he suddenly stopped and turned to look at Lu Ting Xiao. \u201cYou deliberately sent away Little Treasure the day before yesterday. Ning Xi would be starting work in two days and since she would be very busy, you knew time was running out! So within those two days, you would have certainly made a big move! Big move\u2026\u2026was it a confession?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did this mean that he guessed right?</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli\u2019s eyes lit up as he continued to speculate: \u201cThe confession most probably didn\u2019t succeed, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here at the office, but definitely on the bed.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Lu Jingli snapped his fingers, and concluded with certainty, \u201cThere\u2019s only one truth! You confessed to Little Xixi, and she didn\u2019t accept you, but also didn\u2019t refuse. She is probably thinking, and the likelihood of her saying a yes is very big! So that\u2019s why you\u2019re in a good mood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao looked at his brother\u2019s beaming face, and an unnoticeable gentleness appeared on his face\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He had a cold personality since birth, and didn\u2019t get along well with others. Even his relationship with his biological parents was very weak, but only this brother, he would stay around him all day when others hid in fear of him. He knew he always had a cold face, yet his brother did not care and did not get angry. He dislike speaking, thus his brother would guess his thoughts by himself, and they were always accurate.</p><br/><p>He thought he was already lucky enough and would have never expected that fate would allow him to meet Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>From midsummer to early autumn, \u201cLand Under Heaven\u201d would finally resume filming after the many twists and turns regarding the cast.</p><br/><p>Because of the changes in script, the screen time for Ning Xuelo and Zhao Sizhou had been reduced by a fair amount. Initially, Ning Xuelo and Ning Xi had three more scenes together, but they had all been cut. This meant that during her remaining few shoots, she would not be meeting Ning Xuelo in the studio anymore, which saved her a lot of worry. She can finally focus on filming the movie.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s shoot was mainly Ning Xi and Jiang Muye\u2019s two important scenes. Not only did Ning Xi\u2019s agent Lin Zhizhi come, Jiang Muye\u2019s agent Lei Ming also personally came, it is thus clear that the importance of the two scenes today.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi and Jiang Muye arrived almost at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Jiang~\u201d Ning Xi sweetly greeted. She quick-wittedly changed the way she address him, from \u201cSenior Jiang\u201d to \u201cSenior Brother Jiang\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Junior Sister!\u201d Looking at Ning Xi who was pretending to be a well-behaved little girl, Jiang Muye shuddered, getting goosebumps.</p><br/><p>Then, his eyes casually swept over to Lin Zhizhi, who was beside Ning Xi\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(T/N Akari: she changed the way she address him from Senior Jiang [] to Senior Brother Jiang [], because they are now under the same company, so like uhm, they have the same \u2018teacher\u2019, thus their r/s is now senior bro-sis. Whereas before, they were only under the same industry, so it\u2019s the normal elder/senior greeting\u2026ahaha.)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

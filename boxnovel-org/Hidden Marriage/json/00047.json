The seventh prince Chu Beichen and his consort Shanggong Yingrong would use their quick wits to counter the challenges from the emissaries. As the Consort De, Ning Xi did not need to do much. She only needed to act as a bewitching and graceful ornament by the emperor\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>However, even so, wearing so many layers of ancient style clothing on such a hot day was bad enough.</p><br/><p>Especially since Ning Xi\u2019s costumes were the most complicated. Not only were the clothes thick, even the accessories on her head weighed a few kilograms.</p><br/><p>After filming one scene, while no one could tell from the outside, she was sweating completely on the inside.</p><br/><p>As soon as the director shouted \u201cCut!\u201d, Ning Xueluo\u2019s two assistants immediately rushed over, eager to attend to her. One of them fanned her while the other passed water to her, and the chair was already equipped with a cooling mat.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a single assistant by Ning Xi\u2019s side. After filming, she wasn\u2019t able to have even a single sip of water. As she still had scenes to film, she couldn\u2019t even remove the clothes on her, and could only unbutton the collar for some air.</p><br/><p>Everyone was praising Ning Xueluo\u2019s performance, and the director added a few compliments as well. However, when he turned back to the screens, he kept rewatching a few screens where Ning Xi had appeared.</p><br/><p>Although she had no lines and the camera had focused on her only a few times, her expression was simply too perfect. Looking alluring and indolent even while bored stiff, her expression also carried a few traces of contempt for the people beneath her, because she was preparing to destroy this entire kingdom with her own hands.</p><br/><p>Good, he could finally rest easy.</p><br/><p>At this time, the errand boy Xiao Li shouted excitedly, \u201cTeacher Ning, your boyfriend is here to visit you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, he meant Ning Xueluo with \u2018Teacher Ning\u2019.</p><br/><p>Su Yan walked over in refreshing casualwear. Two servants were following behind him and carrying a large box, and they started distributing ice cream to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! It\u2019s Haagen-Daazs! Thanks for treating us, Mr Su!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Ning is too fortunate, it\u2019s only the first time, and her boyfriend is already here to visit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod! What about us single dogs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, even giving you something to eat won\u2019t hold your tongues!\u201d Ning Xueluo protested coquettishly, then brought a box of ice cream to Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Ning, you should eat too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Ning Xi received it politely.</p><br/><p>This woman would always act like an angel in front of others, especially in front of Su Yan. Even if Ning Xueluo wasn\u2019t tired of it, she had already had enough of watching her act. Luckily Ning Xi was an actress by profession, and didn\u2019t mind acting along with her.</p><br/><p>After returning to her seat, Ning Xueluo looked at Su Yan as if she had something to say, but found it difficult to talk. In the end, she still spoke up hesitantly, \u201cYan-gege, I\u2019m a little worried about Xiao Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What happened to Xiao Xi?\u201d Su Yan immediately asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was the opening party last night, right? My dad came, and he met Xiao Xi. I\u2019m not sure what Xiao Xi said to dad, but he flew into a terrible rage and wanted to kick her out from her role\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Su Yan frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either, by the time I got there, dad was already furious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened afterwards? It looks like Xiao Xi hasn\u2019t been switched out?\u201d Su Yan looked towards Ning Xi\u2019s direction, only to see that she was reading the script earnestly despite sweating profusely under the sun. Although she cut a sorry figure, her face was dazzlingly brilliant under the sunlight.</p><br/><p>Speaking in a hesitant manner, Ning Xueluo continued, \u201cMy dad called the production team last night, and they agreed to the switch over the phone. However, the next morning, someone anonymously invested 50 million into this movie, and their only request was that Ning Xi had to be the supporting female lead\u2026 I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yan\u2019s expression turned uglier and uglier as he listened. Finally, he said in a low voice, \u201cI know Xiao Xi. She would never do something like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan-gege, you\u2019re too naive. What kind of place is the entertainment circle? Were there any people who didn\u2019t change upon entering this circle? For me, I\u2019m lucky because I have daddy and you to support me, but Ning Xi has such a bad relationship with our family and she refused to accept our help. Don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t know what can happen to a beautiful girl with no power and backing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, there\u2019s someone looking for you!\u201d At this moment, the errand boy shouted again, but with a weird tone.</p><br/><p>Within an instant, everyone turned their gazes over.</p><br/><p>Because it was too eye-catching.</p><br/><p>Red roses\u2026</p><br/><p>Enough red roses to cover the entire set were slowly being brought in by people\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

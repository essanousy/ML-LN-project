The number of inquiring passersby and fans started to increase until the entire hotel and area nearby were fully surrounded by people\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, they really would not be able to leave!</p><br/><p>The entire hotel entrance was crowded and chaotic. The security guards was busy and sounds of sirens came from all around.</p><br/><p>The crazy media and emotional fans were not willing to leave no matter what\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it unless Bro Xi tells us that this is true!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! I don\u2019t believe it! I don\u2019t! Bro Xi is definitely not that kind of person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo hell with it! Ning Xi\u2019s idiotic fans are still muddleheaded until now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you calling \u2018idiotic fans\u2019?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling whoever that\u2019s answering me right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 I\u2019m going to kill you! No one\u2019s allowed to insult my Bro Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When she saw the fans rioting but she was still puking her guts out, Ning Xi looked outside the car window with a pale face and said, \u201cBro Tao, open the door. I want to go out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao was shocked. \u201cWhat?! Ning Xi, you\u2019re crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Feixing, who had not said anything from the backseat of the car, quickly said, \u201cYou can\u2019t! It\u2019s too dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could she watch as her fans argue and even fight for her while she sat in the car not being in the least concerned?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Xu Tao met with Ning Xi\u2019s stern gaze and was suddenly tongue-tied.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was usually very kind, especially towards staff like them, but when it involved a matter of principle, no one could advise her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t open the door!\u201d This time, Liang Feixing was on Xu Tao\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>There were so many people outside, and the Lady Boss was pregnant. If anything happened, he would not be able to repay with his little life.</p><br/><p>Just as Xu Tao was hesitating, Ning Xi had already surpassed him and clicked the control panel. Then, she pushed the door open and got down from the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi\u2026\u201d Xu Tao cried out. He and Liang Feixing quickly got down from the car and protected Ning Xi by her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to trouble everyone to please keep quiet first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl looked a little weak and exceptionally pale, but those pair of eyes were akin to the sharp edge of a knife. They actually made everyone stunned for some reason, and they quieted down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the response that you guys want now,\u201d Ning Xi continued.</p><br/><p>The media, fans, and everyone in the live stream sites\u2026 all revealed a shocked expression. They waited nervously for Ning Xi\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat medical report is real. I am pregnant.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s clear and melodious voice rang in the silent air. The crowd was dumbstruck for three seconds before they instantly exploded into a commotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God! Ning Xi admits it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really pregnant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 how is this possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>The media that had just been quiet for a moment earlier started to be stimulated again\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, who\u2019s the father!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what we know, you don\u2019t even have a boyfriend. Do you and the child\u2019s father have an improper intimate relationship!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fans went completely crazy too. \u201cHow could this be!? Who does the child belong to!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the haters seized the opportunity and popped up. \u201cTsk tsk, I thought that Ning Xi was a fresh air in the entertainment industry. Who would\u2019ve thought that she would also be exposed foran unmarried pregnancy scandal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no different from Ning Xueluo, Han Zixuan, and people like that! For all we know, she might be even skankier in private! It\u2019s just that she\u2019s better at pretending and hasn\u2019t been found out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor all we know, the child\u2019s father might be some married man. Otherwise, why would she have tried to cover it up?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

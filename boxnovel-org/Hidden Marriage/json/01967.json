He actually fancied roles like assassins that could play it cool.</p><br/><p>\u201cA cross-dressing one,\u201d added Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jiang Muye\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cA cross-dressing assassin!\u201d Ning Xi explained.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye jumped up and started yelling as he pointed his fingers in front of Ning Xi\u2019s nose. \u201cNing Xiao Xi, you maniac, you haven\u2019t given up on it yet! Why must you make me cross-dress? Keep your dirty thoughts. I\u2019ll never wear a female outfit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ning Xi narrowed her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, most real of all! If I wear a female outfit, I\u2019ll be your son!\u201d Jiang Muye chuckled coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Ning Xi shook her head. With a regretful expression, she lamented, \u201cWell, I wanted to share some nice things for you, but you don\u2019t want it. Fine then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can keep your so-called nice things to yourself!\u201d Jiang Muye looked like he was done with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSadly, I\u2019ll just have to find someone else for the role of the assassin, Carl.\u201d Ning Xi turned around and was about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Assassin Carl?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye blocked the exit when he heard what Ning Xi said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026 the Hollywood movie, \u2018Assassin\u2019?\u201d Jiang Muye asked incredulously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, what else?\u201d Ning Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying, Ning Xiao Xi! Why would they look for a Chinese actor for such an important character?\u201d Jiang Muye was really doubtful of her.</p><br/><p>Even if they were really looking for a Chinese actor, how was it related to Ning Xi and why would they let Ning Xi decide on the actor?</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took the contract out and tossed it over to Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>With a skeptical attitude, Jiang Muye opened the contract and read through it carefully.</p><br/><p>After a while, Jiang Muye\u2019s pupils shrunk.</p><br/><p>It really was the contract for the new \u201cAssassin\u201d. More specifically, it was for the role of Carl!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi would never use such things to trick him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck!? Ning Xiao Xi, how did you get this? You\u2019re the best!\u201d Jiang Muye was thrilled over the moon.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was a loyal fan of \u201cAssassin\u201d and had probably watched the film over a hundred times.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, his super idol Jace was the producer for the new \u201cAssassin\u201d!</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it back!\u201d Ning Xi snatched the contract back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunty, don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ll do it\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye beamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Not even calling me your aunt can do it!\u201d Ning Xi was not buying it. \u201cJust now, someone said that I\u2019ll be his father if he\u2019s going to do it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d Jiang Muye yelled immediately as he stared at Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless. She had nothing more to say to Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>He was so reluctant to take up this role and had even said some harsh words before when she asked him to take up the role.</p><br/><p>Yet, now he was calling her father and wanted to sign the contract desperately.</p><br/><p>What happened to his integrity?</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye smiled and tried to make his grin even more genuine. \u201cFather, I\u2019m wrong! Really!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched and she passed the contract back to Jiang Muye. \u201cTake a good look at it. I need to reply to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>After signing his name on it as soon as possible, he asked curiously, \u201cNing Xiao Xi, how did you get me this character?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Jace asked me for a recommendation, so I gave your name since I think you\u2019re suitable,\u201d said Ning Xi simply.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye was surprised when Ning Xi mentioned Jace so casually.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I want to find...or rent a guy to pretend to be my boyfriend and let my grandfather meet him, so he would feel assured.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why don't you bring me?\" Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>\"Uhh...bring...you?\" Ning Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao did not look too happy. Did she not even think of him at all?</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly reacted and said, \"Um, what I mean is that if I brought you...my grandfather probably wouldn't be assured, but shocked instead...\"</p><br/><p>\"At such a moment, he wouldn't believe you even more if you brought someone else over. You can only bring me.\" Lu Tingxiao tone was firm.</p><br/><p>\"Mmm...is that so?\"</p><br/><p>\"If you don't bring me, who else would you bring?\" Lu Tingxiao looked at her to ask.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked at him weakly., \"Should I be honest?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head. \"Actually...I wanted to bring Xi Shiqing over to help cover up since his identity is more suitable, plus Grandfather has always quite liked him, thus...\"</p><br/><p>Before she could finish, Ning Xi could already feel a sense of danger. She quickly held onto Lu Tingxiao's arm and said, \"Hey, I think Grandfather would definitely like you more! Let's go, I'll bring you over tomorrow!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao shot her a look.</p><br/><p>Of course, he knew her concern was logical. With his identity, it would be hard for the elder to believe that he was sincere. There might even be a possibility that he wouldn't accept him.</p><br/><p>\"I will settle whatever you're worried about.\" Lu Tingxiao looked at the girl and gave her his reassurance.</p><br/><p>\"Sadly, a boyfriend can immediately be brought over, but the wish for a great-grandchild cannot be fulfilled...\" Ning Xi looked sad as she mumbled, \"Even if I started making one now, I wouldn't make it in time!\"</p><br/><p>As Ning Xi said this, she suddenly thought of something and excitedly stood up, \"Lu Tingxiao, uhh...can you lend me Little Treasure?\"</p><br/><p>\"No need.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah? What do you mean? You're not lending?\"</p><br/><p>\"No need to lend, he's yours, to begin with.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was so touched that she started to tear up. \"I'm not sure if what I'm doing is right...but I know...that if I don't do anything, I would definitely regret it...\"</p><br/><p>There was no way she would let her grandfather pass away with regrets and without peace of mind...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Thus, the next morning, Ning Xi brought Lu Tingxiao and the little bun to the hospital.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao had probably arranged beforehand. The ward area was extremely quiet without any random people around. A doctor personally led them upstairs.</p><br/><p>\"Doctor, how's my grandfather? Is he better today?\" Ning Xi asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>The doctor shook his head heavily. \"Very terrible, he remains in a daze. If the situation continues to worsen like this, I'm afraid...within the next two days...\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Ning Xi suddenly changed in expression.</p><br/><p>She was initially hesitating about whether to lie to her grandfather about Little Treasure, but now, she could not care so much anymore.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi took a deep breath and pushed the door into the ward.</p><br/><p>\"Grandfather, I've come to see you!\"</p><br/><p>On the sick bed, the elder's spirit looked worse than yesterday. When he heard Ning Xi's voice, he only lifted up his eyes slightly. \"Xiao Xi...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The cutting of the fabric flattered her mesmerising waistline while the collar revealed her beautiful collarbone. This colour was even harder to pull off than pure red and it was even made of lace. Although it had a great design, most people would only look terrible or tacky when wearing it.</p><br/><p>However, it was as if that dress was made for Ning Xi. It enhanced her looks and made her even more charming and lovely, thereby causing her beauty to stand out.</p><br/><p>When the stylist had picked this dress out for her, Ning Xi herself had also thought that she wouldn\u2019t be able to pull it off. However, she had been proven wrong after putting it on.</p><br/><p>As expected of the Godly Hand of Golden Age Entertainment, he had great eyes. He knew her better than she knew herself after just one meeting.</p><br/><p>Although it was Ning Xi\u2019s first time walking the red carpet, she was an actress after all. She had already tried on many various roles with different occupations, which naturally included celebrities, and had even acted as one once or twice. Walking down the red carpet was easy.</p><br/><p>Every step, every smile and every action caught just the right angles for the cameras. She could even show the most perfect expressions.</p><br/><p>The reporters remained dazed for even longer than Director Guo had, and only regained their senses after a long while.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 this was Ning Xi, the actress who was going to play Meng Changge?</p><br/><p>An unknown rookie without any known work?</p><br/><p>This\u2026. wasn\u2019t she too beautiful?</p><br/><p>There were no other words to describe it, she was just\u2026 beautiful!</p><br/><p>Now they realised why Director Guo\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look right when they were so persistent with their questions just now. It was ridiculous to ask whether Jia Qingqing or Ning Xi was more beautiful.</p><br/><p>In front of an absolute beauty like Ning Xi, even a \u2018beautiful\u2019 starlet like Jia Qingqing would become just a simple face in the crowd.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just her looks, but also the way she held herself that made her stand out from the other rookies. Her gestures were both elegant and open, even exuding an innate nobility.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi walked to the center of the red carpet and casually posed a few times to let the media take pictures. Following that, she turned around and picked up the pen from the tray to sign her name on the wall.</p><br/><p>This one turn of her body caused a wave of excitement and shutter clicks.</p><br/><p>The dress had been designed to reveal the back, and that was one of the reasons the stylist had chosen this dress in the end.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s shoulder blades were simply too beautiful. They were the most entrancing part of her whole body, and it would be too much of a shame if they weren\u2019t shown off.</p><br/><p>Most female stars liked to reveal cleavage to draw attention when walking the red carpet, but Ning Xi had taken another route, elevating her above the rest.</p><br/><p>After murdering countless rolls of film, it was finally time to interview her.</p><br/><p>The reporters were actually quite pitiful today.</p><br/><p>They had all prepared questions like \u2018Do you think you\u2019ll be able to play a vixen like Meng Changge well with looks like that?\u2019, \u2018Who do you think is prettier, you or Jia Qingqing?\u2019, \u2018We\u2019ve heard that you were specially picked outside of official channels, was there a reason for that?\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>Now they weren\u2019t able to use any of those questions at all\u2026</p><br/><p>As long as they weren\u2019t blind, they would know that nothing had happened behind the scenes, her face was just too convincing.</p><br/><p>She was just the most suitable person to play Meng Changge.</p><br/><p>Thus the reporters had to spin up questions on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ning, may I ask if the dress you\u2019re wearing is a customised piece from Karl Lagerfeld?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>What the heck, this was a custom gown from Karl Lagerfeld?</p><br/><p>She had casually put on a dress worth thousands of dollars?</p><br/><p>Evil King Lu, what were you thinking!!</p><br/><p>However, an even more terrifying question was lying in wait for her. Following that question, the same reporter named the origins of each item she was wearing and then asked, \u201cMiss Ning, is Arthur your stylist?\u201d</p><br/><p>You could even tell something just like that?</p><br/><p>What kind of eyesight do you have!!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

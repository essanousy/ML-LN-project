His hands had already clenched into fists without him even realizing it.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a sweet fragrance covered him and came into contact with his cold lips. That warm voice echoed through the endless night.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad\u2026 I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s you. There\u2019s nothing better than this in the whole world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The flames were extinguished as ash fell onto the soil and flowers started blooming\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao hugged the girl tightly and gave her a deep kiss. How he wished the two of them could merge together!</p><br/><p>Those were the most touching words he had ever heard in his life.</p><br/><p>His girl, bringing him touching and surprising moments again and again\u2026</p><br/><p>The two of them stayed beside each other under the moonlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I should\u2019ve told you earlier.\u201d Lu Tingxiao kissed the girl on the top of her head.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi nodded in agreement. \u201cRight, if you had told me earlier, then you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it for so long! You didn\u2019t even mind when I told you about myself, so why would I leave you for this? Moreover, it\u2019s not just anyone else. It\u2019s you, my husband. I\u2019m really happy. Anyhow, it\u2019s Lu Jingli\u2019s fault anyway!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli, who was eavesdropping in a corner, burst out, \u201cWhy am I being blamed without even doing anything?!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Fine, it was such a touching moment, so blame him all she wanted!</em></p><br/><p>Luckily, Xiao Xi Xi did not divorce his brother. If not, he would really be dead.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao felt as if his whole body was immersed in warm water. His burning organs were now all healed and he was relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi could fully understand what Lu Tingxiao felt. No matter how smart a person was, one would fall into such a state if they cared about another person too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was also another reason why I didn\u2019t tell you yet.\u201d Lu Tingxiao\u2019s tone sounded duller than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ning Xi could feel that what Lu Tingxiao was about to say was really important.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been investigating this matter\u2026 about who sent Little Treasure to the Lu family and what his purpose was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes sharpened. \u201cHave you found out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s tone sounded dull. \u201cNot yet, but we\u2019re chasing an important clue. I noticed the hospital security camera footage had a section removed. We\u2019ll find out who it is after recovering the lost footage. I planned to tell you after I found out about everything. If there are no issues, the footage should be completed in several days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s expression looked serious. \u201cWho could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao remained silent. He had no idea who it could be too.</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a voice behind them.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi quickly turned around to see Little Treasure standing behind her and staring right at her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s eyes teared up when she saw the little bun. \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure rubbed his eyes with the back of his wrists, then he jumped onto his mother. \u201cMommy\u2026 Are you really Little Treasure\u2019s mother? Did you give birth to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, yes, I\u2019m Little Treasure\u2019s mother. I gave birth to you\u2026\u201d She then felt some wetness on her shoulder and Ning Xi\u2019s heart twitched painfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d Little Treasure looked at his father, his eyes seeming as fragile as glass.</p></div>\n</div>"}

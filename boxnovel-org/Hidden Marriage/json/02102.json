Or was Ning Xi losing on purpose?</p><br/><p>It must be a mistake! Hitting 0.1 points lower every time was much more difficult than hitting 10 points every time!</p><br/><p>The competition went on\u2026</p><br/><p>Eighth shot: Eliza, 9.8 points; Ning Xi, 9.7 points</p><br/><p>Ninth shot: Eliza, 5.5 points; Ning Xi, 5.4 points</p><br/><p>On the tenth shot, Eliza made a mistake and only got 1 point. Ning Xi shot out of range and got 0 points!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the tenth shot, everyone saw Ning Xi just fire into the air.</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><br/><p>They were probably blind if they had not seen that Ning Xi was losing on purpose.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi turned the safety lock on and handed the gun to a waiter beside her before she looked over at Eliza and shrugged. \u201cI lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl in the red dress then left.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! You did that on purpose!\u201d Eliza was frustrated and her face turned red.</p><br/><p>Li Muyan just remained stationary. His worked-up feelings had now fizzled out and the fire inside him was extinguished.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli was impressed as he streamed the whole scene for his brother. \u201cDamn! Sister-in-law was amazing! Even though she lost, it\u2019s a complete victory over that Eliza!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there right away.\u201d Lu Tingxiao left him with these few words and then hung up the call. He did not want to wait any longer; he just wanted to see her.</p><br/><p>The sky turned dark and almost all the guests had arrived. The atmosphere was getting more and more lively with fairy lights starting to light up on the grass, resembling stars in the sky and filling up the venue with a sense of fantasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, so beautiful! Lu Tingxiao\u2019s birthday banquet used to be usually organized in hotels, which were so rigid and boring! It\u2019s suddenly so romantic this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably for Mrs. Lu!\u201d One of the girls said with an envious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard Mrs. Lu is appearing tonight too. Is that true? I don\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe it! Could it be that Lu Tingxiao is really married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe it too, but my sources are reliable and it shouldn\u2019t be mistaken. Actually, there were rumors for a very long time ago before. It\u2019s just that the Lu family has been so low-profile that until now, no one knows who Mrs. Lu is! I tried to find out from Lu Jingli. He told me personally that his sister-in-law will be coming tonight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod! I\u2019m going to be heartbroken!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you. Do you know how many more other women are going through heartbreak? I wonder who\u2019s so lucky, or who\u2019s so powerful to tame a man like Lu Tingxiao. Rumor has it that Lu Tingxiao was really doting to that woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Eliza was still angry about being embarrassed just now, so she ignored Li Muyan\u2019s actions to stop her and she stomped up to Ning Xi angrily. \u201cNing Xi, what were you trying to do just now? Are you insulting me and Bro Muyan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi raised her eyebrows, acting confused. \u201cInsult? You\u2019re the one who won, Ms. Eliza. How is that an insult?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

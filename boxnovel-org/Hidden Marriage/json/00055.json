You should know that many asexuals never meet someone like that in their whole lives!\u201d Qin Mufeng sincerely congratulated his old friend.</p><br/><p>Other than heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality, there was another sexual orientation in this world called asexuality.</p><br/><p>Being asexual didn\u2019t mean that they had some sort of physical condition or that their sexual orientation was undetermined, and it also wasn\u2019t due to fear of intimate relations. Simply put, it was \u2018disinterest towards sexual love\u2019.</p><br/><p>It was due to this \u2018illness\u2019 that his mother had urged Lu Jingli to drug him five years ago\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis could be called \u2018fortune comes in pairs\u2019. So, when do I get to drink wine at your wedding?\u201d Qin Mufeng teased.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d When it came to this topic, a thread of unease appeared on Lu Tingxiao\u2019s face. He was too used to things sailing smoothly.</p><br/><p>Qin Mufeng was surprised, \u201cYou mean you\u2019re still working on it? I thought that with the great CEO Lu at work, it was already a done deal. A girl that can attract you is indeed different from most! So this time you\u2019ve come looking for me to get me to teach you how to chase a girl? Although my practical experience pales in comparison to Jingli, I\u2019m pretty good at theory!\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was it that everyone wanted to teach him how to woo girls?</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression turned black, \u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary. I called you here to confirm the influence her appearance has had on Little Treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he was done with the jokes, Qin Mufeng got down to business, \u201cIt\u2019s like this, there are two sides to every matter. Although this is a good thing, as you\u2019ve said earlier, Little Treasure wrecked the house just for the sake of meeting her. So the most important thing to do is to see how to guide him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you did it for selfish reasons or not, temporarily keeping her here is the right thing to do. For the next step, I suggest that you get that girl to help out. Bring Little Treasure out for walks more often, and when the time is right, you can even send him to school. Let him start living a normal life step by step. I spent two years and never managed to do it, but maybe she\u2019ll be able to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, I\u2019ll try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the movie city.</p><br/><p>The moment Ning Xi entered the set, the whispers in the surroundings immediately stopped, and everyone stared at her with strange expressions.?</p><br/><p>It seemed like the rumours had already spread.</p><br/><p>In the corner, someone whispered in a peculiar tone, \u201cWhat\u2019s this, she\u2019s just a rookie and yet she came in so late. Doesn\u2019t she see that Teacher Ning is already here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, it wasn\u2019t that Ning Xi had come late, but Ning Xueluo had come too early.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Ning, you\u2019re in the same company as Ning Xi, are those rumours spreading online true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone even said that she slept with a lot of people in our crew for the sake of getting this role!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too shameless! Doesn\u2019t Starlight care about this kind of dishonest competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Facing the crowd\u2019s questions, faint helplessness appeared on Ning Xueluo\u2019s face as she sighed, \u201cWe each use our own abilities, so the company won\u2019t care\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, she seemed to have realised that she had said something wrong and quickly added on, \u201cI mean that my junior didn\u2019t really do those things, you can\u2019t trust rumours on the internet!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it became even more conspicuous when she tried to cover it up, which made everyone even more sure that the rumours were true.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the director came over to urge everyone to start work that the idle gossipers dispersed.</p><br/><p>The pure and innocent look on Ning Xueluo\u2019s face also faded instantly, and she called over the assistant at the side, inquiring in a low voice, \u201cHow\u2019s the task I assigned to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXueluo-jie, don\u2019t worry, everything has been prepared! Didn\u2019t you say that she\u2019s allergic to metal? I put metal powder in the makeup artist\u2019s kit when no one was looking, her whole face is going to be ruined\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

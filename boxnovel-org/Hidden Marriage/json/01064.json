I just feel that it might be too troublesome.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's not troublesome at all! We'd all welcome you if you were to come! That's all set, then!\" Zhuang Keer ignored her brother.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, see you tomorrow!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi started humming a song and looked for what to wear after she ended the call.</p><br/><p>\"In a good mood?\" Lu Tingxiao asked as he saw Ning Xi was chirpier after the call with Zhuang Keer.</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha...Lu Tingxiao! Let me tell you something funny!\" Ning Xi told him how she had pranked Zhuang Rongguang from the start to end.</p><br/><p>\"I was in a male outfit then, so he had always thought that I was a man. In the end, I told him that if he could do it, I'll wear a pink princessy dress and walk around the shooting range for three rounds! That brat has trained hard in order to beat me!</p><br/><p>\"Zhuang Keer also mentioned that he was so hardworking that he even forgot to eat sometimes. I'm actually rooting for him. I really want to see his reaction when he realized that I'm a girl, hahaha\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao's dislike towards Zhuang Liaoyuan faded when he saw the girl's wide smile. \"Did Zhuang Liaoyuan mention that matter to you again?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry, he never mentioned it again! Actually, Zhuang Rongguang is really talented. If he can actually change his attitude, Chief Zhuang will never prey after me again!\"</p><br/><p>\"What time are you coming back tomorrow?\"</p><br/><p>\"Probably after dinner. I promised Keer.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi noticed Lu Tingxiao staring at her face when she was talking, so she touched her own face. \"Is there something on my face?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao gazed at the girl's smiling face, then he leaned in and kissed her. \"You look really good.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blushed and covered her face bashfully. \"Really?\"</p><br/><p>Oh no! The devil was getting more and more flirtatious lately! He could always flirt with her anytime anywhere\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Ning Xi, I hope you can be this happy when you're with me every day.\"</p><br/><p>\"Rest assured, I'm always happy when I'm with you!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next afternoon, Ning Xi changed into a male outfit and reached the shooting range ten minutes before the promised time.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang was already there and he looked very well prepared as his face brimmed with determination. He grinned when he saw Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\"Bro Xi, you're here!\" Zhuang Keer had come early as well and she welcomed Ning Xi warmly.</p><br/><p>\"So, you're here.\" Zhuang Rongguang turned around and looked at her coldly.</p><br/><p>After not seeing him for some time, Zhuang Rongguang had become thinner, but not haggard or tired. Hiis eyes were burning with fire and he reminded her of Zhuang Liaoyuan.</p><br/><p>Advanced level of training in shooting could discipline a person. It seemed like it had affected him positively even though it might be temporary at this point.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Rongguang was acting out of rage this time. In regards to his personality, it might take much more time for him to change his attitude.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

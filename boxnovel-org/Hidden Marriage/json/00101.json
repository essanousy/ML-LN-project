She still hadn\u2019t found out how things had gone after releasing that video last night.</p><br/><p>It was all that Jiang Muye\u2019s fault. Ever since he returned to the country, he had been constantly throwing tantrums and causing trouble for her.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi opened her computer and quickly browsed for the information she was looking for.</p><br/><p>The video where Jia Qingqing had failed the scene 33 times was already a hot topic. The comments section was filled with scoldings, while Ning Xi\u2019s surprisingly good acting had gotten favourable comments. Following that, everyone was starting to suspect that the post that claimed that Ning Xi was sleeping around the set was false.</p><br/><p>Closely after, one after another, there were anons revealing that Jia Qingqing had used the excuse of filming to act on her private grudge. She had maliciously slapped Ning Xi while filming a scene, she even slapped her assistant, and she would throw her weight around and trouble the crew members, etc\u2026</p><br/><p>Up until the end, all the artistes and production crew members who didn\u2019t like Jia Qingqing continued piling on the hate, exposing everything she had done behind the scenes, and completely destroyed the false image that Jia Qingqing\u2019s fans had of her.</p><br/><p>Makeup Artist Amy: I hated Ning Xi at first, because Jia Qingqing kept trying to make trouble for Ning Xi and implicated us crew members while doing so. For example, for the sake of making Ning Xi wait, she would do things like finding faults in her makeup and continuously getting me to redo it would happen everyday. Back then, I felt that I had been dragged in by Ning Xi, so I hated her for a long period of time. Actually, it wasn\u2019t her fault at all.</p><br/><p>I know someone\u2019s going to find trouble with me for saying this, but my conscience won\u2019t rest until I say this out. On that day when Jiang Muye\u2019s fans came to the set to make a ruckus, if Ning Xi hadn\u2019t used her arm to block a rock for me, I would have gotten a wound on my face!</p><br/><p>Errand Boy Xiao Li: Frank and outspoken? More like crazy jealous. Jia Qingqing is a malignant tumour on set, she acts arrogantly and throws her weight around. She\u2019s practically late every day and leaves early without saying anything. She even orders people around with her nose pointed in the air, completely not treating us workers as humans. In a single day, I have to run back and forth dozens of times just for her. Does she seriously think I\u2019m one of her family\u2019s servants?</p><br/><p>As for Ning Xi, although she usually keeps to herself and seems a little distant, she always treats us workers politely. Every time we wrap up filming, she thanks everyone. Even when we were biased against her and didn\u2019t reply to her, she still continued to do so every time.</p><br/><p>Director\u2019s Assistant: Words are cheap, but I\u2019d still like to say a fair word. It was only on the first day of filming that people sent things to Ning Xi. Normally, I don\u2019t see Ning Xi flirting around with any men. It\u2019s normal for a beautiful woman to have a few admirers, I didn\u2019t think that the news would get warped to such an extent!</p><br/><p>Cameraman: There\u2019s nothing to criticise about Ning Xi\u2019s professional skills. She has a good feel of the camera and gets into the right position by herself. Usually, she passes in a single take unless someone else makes a mistake. So I\u2019m the most relaxed whenever I film her. As for Jia Qingqing\u2026 she\u2019s probably the worst nightmare of any cameraman! She overdid her plastic surgery and her nose is shaped weirdly. However, she kept blaming it on my poor skills. Am I supposed to film you alone in those shots?</p><br/><p>Director Guo Qisheng: The talk online about Ning Xi getting in through the backdoor is utter nonsense. That is not only an insult towards Ning Xi, but an insult to our entire production crew. I was thinking of waiting until our movie starts screening to show Ning Xi\u2019s performance so that everyone can see the truth. However, since things have gotten to this point and are affecting the progress of our filming, I\u2019m going to show some interesting highlights now. Everyone, see for yourselves! [Video]</p><br/><p>Producer Wang Taihe: Ah, everyone has already spoken. Then let me say something as well! I see that many of you are saying that we suddenly got another 5 billion in funding because of Ning Xi\u2019s sponsor. For the sake of clearing all these up, I requested permission from our investor and am revealing his identity now @LittleKoiPrince</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had expected that many people in the crew were already on the last vestiges of patience towards Jia Qingqing. Once a single person spoke up, the rest would then pile on. She hadn\u2019t expected that they would praise her while criticising Jia Qingqing, that was an unexpected reward. It felt good to have her hard work recognised after all.</p><br/><p>Wang Taihe\u2019s tweet made her rather curious. She quickly opened up the Weibo with the ID @LittleKoiPrince to see who that investor was\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t make sense at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Compared to Gong Shangze who was unknown in the international fashion industry, everyone would subconsciously believe David more.</p><br/><p>Because of David\u2019s hints, everyone naturally wondered if the clothes had been tampered with.</p><br/><p>When Akas heard, he pondered too, \u201cIndeed we can\u2019t rule out the possibility that these characters had been embroidered on afterwards without your knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>When David heard the replies that had been within his expectations, he instantly let out a long sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Still, before the corner of David\u2019s lips could curl up into a smile, he saw that the young man beside Akas had said with a certain voice and without expression, \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone\u2019s gazes fell onto the young man again.</p><br/><p>Akas frowned and asked, \u201cWhy is that impossible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of the huge twist earlier, this time, no one spoke rashly. Everyone held their breaths and waited for the young man\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze folded up one of the sleeves and answered word for word, \u201cBecause, for this part of the embroidery, I used the technique of double-sided three-fold embroidery.\u201d</p><br/><p>Double-sided three-fold embroidery?</p><br/><p>What was that?</p><br/><p>When they heard this incredibly alien term, the crowd started to buzz with discussion again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, what\u2019s double-sided three-fold embroidery?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never even heard of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard of double-sided embroidery. It\u2019s a very hard embroidering technique. Single-sided embroidery only needs the front to look delicate. However, the threads going on the other side could be neglected, while double-sided embroidery requires both sides to be equally neat and well distributed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Even Chinese people did not understand what Gong Shangze had mentioned. For the Chinese in the industry to only know a little, what more the foreigners? At the moment, everyone was baffled.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a middle-aged man in a white flax lounging outfit walked up onto the stage.</p><br/><p>When the crowd saw they instantly cried out excitedly, \u201cIt\u2019s Qu Guanyang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight! Teacher Qu will definitely know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Akas had been troubled earlier, but when he saw Qu Guanyang walk over, he instantly let out a sigh of relief. \u201cQu, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to trouble you about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Akas, you\u2019re too courteous.\u201d Qu Guanyang nodded and shared greetings with Akas before his insightful eyes skimmed the young man beside Akas.</p><br/><p>The first time he saw this young one was at the Golden Awards. His design style had been accused of copying David, yet in the end, he had with true capabilities bagged that year\u2019s Golden Award with a full score.</p><br/><p>He never could have imagined that they would meet again in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>Gong Shangze\u2019s clear and clean gaze calmly returned the middle-aged man\u2019s glance.</p><br/><p>Under everyone\u2019s nervous and curious gazes, Qu Guanyang very quickly retrieved his gaze and started to closely inspect every part of the clothes where the characters \u201cGong Shangze\u201d had been embroidered.</p><br/><p>Time passed by\u2026</p><br/><p>Qu Guanyang finally put the clothes hem in his hand down.</p></div>\n</div>"}

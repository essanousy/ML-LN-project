My dear, why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\"</p><br/><p>She was scared! She had just woken up from her sleep and had not done this on purpose!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s adaptation to the situation was so quick that she was already comfortable addressing Lu Tingxiao as \"my dear\". She did know how much of an impact her casual words brought to Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao straightened his back and turned to everyone. \"I\u2019m sorry, my wife isn\u2019t feeling well. Please excuse us.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone smiled. \"It\u2019s alright, CEO Lu! Don\u2019t mind us!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course! Your wife is certainly more important!\"</p><br/><p>\"I see now it\u2019s true that men who love and care for their wife are the most reliable ones!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone broke into excited chatter after Lu Tingxiao went away with Ning Xi in his arms.</p><br/><p>\"I would never expect Lu Tingxiao to make such a big deal just for a woman, but it seems that he really loves her! Thank God that nothing happened to her. Otherwise\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t Lu Tingxiao single? Where did his wife come from? I\u2019ve been wanting to ask since just now!\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s not unusual for people to get married in secret. It's even more common for people like Lu Tingxiao\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah, my daughter has been missing Mr. Lu since the last time she saw him. I didn\u2019t expect him to be married already!\"</p><br/><p>\"There probably wasn\u2019t any chance for your daughter anyway!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! Madam Lu! Where did you go? I was so scared!\" The nurse had just gone out for a while and Ning Xi was already gone when she returned to the room, so she panicked.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s alright, let me do it,\" assured Lu Tingxiao.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, alright!\" The nurse glanced at Lu Tingxiao shyly and left the room.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao lifted the sheets and lay Ning Xi on the bed gently.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi asked, \"Boss, was I smart enough just now to catch on to you?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao squinted his eyes at her. \"Not smart enough to cover your mistake.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked down at the sheets. \"I really barge in on purpose\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Why did you get up when you\u2019re still feeling unwell?\" Lu Tingxiao vented. How could she still run around with injuries on her legs?</p><br/><p>\"Ugh, I had a nightmare\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao sighed, then he explained, \"To be able to rescue you this time, I had to lie and say that you\u2019re my wife. So, during our stay here, you might have to act as one. But it won\u2019t last long. We\u2019ll go back as soon as you feel better.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem! Acting is my profession after all!\" Ning Xi reassured him, \"I can act as any kind of wife you like!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

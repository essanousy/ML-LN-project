Being an actress is a decent job, there\u2019s nothing shameful about that. Yes, the entertainment circle is a little messy, but you can\u2019t just generalise and discriminate everyone in it. Even I\u2019m the boss of Glory World Entertainment! Since you have investigated, then you should also know that Ning Xi has been nothing but decent since she entered the industry. If not, with a face like hers, she would have been famous beyond comparison by now, and not just a B-list newbie.</p><br/><p>\"Secondly, education. Before Ning Xi went abroad, she managed to get into Imperial University with excellent grades. Later, it was only due to disagreements with her family that she was forced to further her studies abroad. Within those four years, she didn\u2019t receive any financial assistance from her family, and relied on herself to get into the Southern Film Academy. Her grades were stellar and she received scholarships every year \u2014 why did you selectively ignore this point?</p><br/><p>\"Thirdly, private life. Every one of Ning Xi\u2019s ex-boyfriends were relationships of open and decent nature. She was neither a third party in any of them, nor was she being taken care of by a sugar daddy, so which part of this is messy? If you guys can accept the fact that I, your son, have had 800 ex-girlfriends, can\u2019t you accept that Ning Xi had eight ex-boyfriends? Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re imposing a double standard here? Let me remind the both of you that we\u2019re in the 21st century; men and women are equal!</p><br/><p>\"Fourthly, family background. Indeed the Ning family has become increasingly outrageous in recent years. They ignore the real treasure of their family and instead side her unruly sister.\" But don\u2019t forget, Ning Xi\u2019s maternal grandfather is Zhuang Zongren. Years ago, they only disowned Zhuang Lingyu because she insisted on marrying Ning Yaohua. Though Ning Xi is still considered their granddaughter, this is a fact that can\u2019t be denied. Zhuang Zongren\u2019s granddaughter is more than enough to match us Lu family, isn\u2019t she?\"</p><br/><p>Father Lu and Mother Lu were both still angry, and initially they were not prepared to listen to Lu Jingli\u2019s defense. However, now that he said his piece, their expressions started to change\u2026</p><br/><p>At this point, Lu Jingli added, \"Fifthly, I forgot to mention the most important thing.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is it?\" both parents eagerly asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli told them, \"The both of you are worrying too much for no reason! Just yesterday, Ning Xi has already rejected big bro. So, stop worrying because Ning Xi is not becoming your daughter-in-laws, nor your grandchildren\u2019s mother. From hereon, she won\u2019t have anything to do with us Lu family.\"</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a piercing sound came from behind \u2014</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli and his parents both turned towards the direction of the sound, only to find Little Treasure\u2019s small figure standing there with broken glass pieces on the floor\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Little Treasure\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Without waiting for the Lu parents to console him, Little Treasure ran into the house and slammed the door shut.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli sighed, \"Great, another one down! After big bro got rejected, he\u2019s been locking himself inside the house and hasn\u2019t left since last night till now!\"</p><br/><p>Mother Lu who was worried for her son and her grandson was now even more anxious and scolded Lu Jingli, \"Bad son! Can\u2019t you watch what you say? Now that Little Treasure has heard us, what do we do now? Little Treasure likes that woman so much!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli looked innocently and replied, \"The day was going to come anyway! Ning Xi only promised big bro that she would accompany Little Treasure for three months, and three months is about to be up. Even if Ning Xi hadn\u2019t set things straight with him, she would eventually have to leave!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

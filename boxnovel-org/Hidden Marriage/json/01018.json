Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi turned around. They then saw Lu Jingli standing there. It seemed like he had just dropped a big pot from his hands onto the ground, his handsome face looking furious.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao still had Ke Mingyu's mask on, so Lu Jingli must have misunderstood!</p><br/><p>\"Jingli, listen to me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Before Ning Xi could continue, Lu Jingli covered his ears and yelled loudly, \"No, I'm not listening! My brother is such an amazing, smart, cool gentleman, is the best husband ever, and even has Little Treasure...It's not just the women in town, even I'm falling in love with him!

How can I relax right now!?\" Lu Jingli turned to Ke Mingyu and looked at him with his furious eyes. \"Bastard! You're the one who seduced my sister-in-law, huh? Don't you know who I am? You dare to mess with her?! I'm going to make you impotent today!\"</p><br/><p>Ugh\u2026\"impotent\", he said\u2026</p><br/><p>Before Lu Jingli could get hurt, Ning Xi slipped in between them and shielded Lu Jingli's attack. \"Lu Jingli, calm down, he's\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli interrupted her with a loud roar before she could finish her sentence, \"Are you serious?! You're even defending him right now?!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi put her hand to her forehead, figuring that she could not reason with him anymore. \"Alright then...I'll not stop you now...go on! Make him impotent! Go!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stepped away, leaving him open to the path to hell.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli charged straight at Ke Mingyu, aiming for his lower body.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Ah!!!\"</p><br/><p>It was a mournful scream.

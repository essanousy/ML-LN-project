I have quite a lot of things so I\u2019ll contact the moving company to bring a truck to help me move!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo worries, it can fit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi thinks in her heart that although this car is pretty spacious, how could it possibly fit so many things? Will it pretend to be doraemon?</p><br/><p>But looking at Lu Ting Xiao calm and unhurried look, she feels that retorting will be inconsiderate, so she could only let him drive all the way to her apartment.</p><br/><p>Forget it, moving the house together is already considered a safer result. At least it has totally nothing related to a romantic atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Once they reached the apartment, Ning Xi pushed the door open. The house is coated with a layer of dust due to no one staying there for a long time. She didn\u2019t know when the window got blown open by the wind and the floor was filled with leaves.</p><br/><p>A burst of autumn cool breeze blew through the window. The slender figure of Lu Ting Xiao stood at the entrance, his gaze held a tinge of warmth as they slowly swept across every corner of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ning Xi looks at him puzzledly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao replied, withdrawing his gaze.</p><br/><p>Although it was Starlight who arranged for her to have this small, worn-out house, this house however contains all their precious memories.</p><br/><p>En, I\u2019ll get someone to buy the house for me immediately when I head back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d Lu Ting Xiao asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rubbed her head, found a huge empty box for him, then point towards a row of high bookshelves and said, \u201cYou are tall enough, can you help me put all the books from the bookshelves into this box?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao rolled up his sleeves, and begin to work.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi look at him wearing clothes that are more expensive than this apartment. Feeling a headache, she starts to rethink her decision, and hurriedly stated, \u201cWait\u2026\u2026 wait here awhile for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, she rummage and found a white coat worn by doctors from somewhere and stood in front of him, \u201cTake off that outerwear, and change into this, to prevent dust.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao followed what she said and took off his outwear, looking at the white coat in amazement, \u201cWhere is this from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a costume ah, previously there was a film group that was so poor that they could not even afford the background actors clothing, so I had to buy this myself!\u201d Ning Xi help him put on the coat, \u201cLuckily this coat is pretty loose fitting!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, looking at Lu Ting Xiao, her breath got taken away. Unconsciously she swallowed her saliva, her face filled with wonderment.</p><br/><p>Lu Xiao Ting wearing a white coat gives off too much of a good feeling!</p><br/><p>This is totally the temptation of costume play!</p><br/><p>Jesus! Even moving out of a house is not safe!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shook her head vigorously to keep her mind clear, \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong\u2026\u2026 let\u2019s begin! I\u2019ll go tidy up my clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d Lu Ting Xiao nodded and glanced at the girls fleeing figure with a knowing look, and begin to clear the bookshelves.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao looks as if he\u2019s doing things leisurely and slowly, but in fact his speed is very fast, his efficiency is very high, the bookshelves were cleared after a while.</p><br/><p>While continuing to move, a photo dropped out of a Shakespeare collection book.</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao casually pick the photo up.</p><br/><p>With a glimpse there is a group of youngster in the photo, all of them wearing punk and heavy metal clothing. Ning Xi is standing right in the middle, short hair, wearing full black biker clothes, a face full of smiles, looking like a very handsome man.</p><br/><p>Her hands were casually placed over a man\u2019s shoulder and is turning her head to talk to him. Their gestures were very intimate. He should be very familiar with her.</p><br/><p>As for the man, because he is currently turning his head to use the lighter, plus the lighting is dim, his features could not be seen clearly, only a blurred side of his face\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

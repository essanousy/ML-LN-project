He was even better at picking up girls than she was!</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao tidied up her messy strands of hair as if it was natural, \u201cWhat do you intend to do next? Find a much bigger leg to hug?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi blinked, not understanding, \u201cHah? What do you mean, find a bigger leg to hug?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to find a big leg to hug last night, and even said that mine wasn\u2019t big enough.\u201d Lu Tingxiao looked at her meaningfully.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi coughed continuously, and was almost choked to death by her own saliva.</p><br/><p>Damn it, just how many shenanigans had happened last night\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lu, I was too drunk last night, so don\u2019t take my words to heart! Your leg is definitely big enough, the biggest leg to hug in the capital is yours!\u201d Her face was full of flattery, but she felt like there was another meaning to her words after having said so\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao was in a good mood after getting flattered. Humour was rippling in his eyes as she said, \u201cThen why won\u2019t you hug mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Ning Xi stammered for a while but couldn\u2019t finish her sentence.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao rubbed her head and decided to let her off the hook, \u201cAlright, I won\u2019t tease you anymore. Let\u2019s go back to the house to sleep, you\u2019ll need your energy to overcome the challenges ahead. Or would you like to stay a while longer with your little darling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no need for that, let\u2019s go back to the house!\u201d She was naturally eager to get out of the car.</p><br/><p>After getting out of the car, Lu Tingxiao stood next to the car door and suddenly stopped moving.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi scratched her head, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao strode over to a bush.</p><br/><p>She followed curiously, and saw\u2026 Second Master Lu carrying a camera in his arms, sleeping soundly in the underbrush with limbs askew.</p><br/><p>She knew that under the banner of Golden Age, there was not only a management company, but also over 300 media outlets. Second Master Lu was considered the boss of all the paparazzi.</p><br/><p>But wasn\u2019t this guy too ridiculous, he wouldn\u2019t miss out even on his own brother\u2019s gossip\u2026</p><br/><p>The corner of Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cSecond Master\u2026 this\u2026 should we wake him? Won\u2019t he catch a cold like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao nodded and kicked him.</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli woke up with a shout.</p><br/><p>He started crying the moment he woke, \u201cYou\u2019re too much! Why are the windows of this car so impermeable! I couldn\u2019t see inside no matter what I used!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao looked down on his silly brother in a domineering manner, \u201cCome to my study later, there\u2019s something I want you to do for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~\u201d Lu Jingli rubbed his eyes and dusted himself off as he climbed to his feet. His gaze flitted nonstop between the two as he muttered, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the car shake! Don\u2019t tell me that I missed the moment? That can\u2019t be! With my brother\u2019s stamina, the car should shake for a whole night at the very least\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201cWhy do you understand your brother\u2019s stamina so well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s easy for people to misunderstand, you know!</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli scratched his head, \u201cThat\u2019s because when he beats me up, he lasts for the whole night!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fine, you win!</p><br/><p>After returning to the room Lu Tingxiao had prepared for her, Ning Xi was totally speechless.</p><br/><p>In just one night and half a day, the guest room had been completely renovated.</p><br/><p>The room\u2019s style had originally been clean with cool tones, but it had been changed into a cosy room with warm tones. Not only that, the closet was filled with a row of clothes all in her size. From pajamas to home clothes to party dresses, even the accessories and handbags were all super ultra limited editions\u2026</p><br/><p>He was simply\u2026 inhumanly rich\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

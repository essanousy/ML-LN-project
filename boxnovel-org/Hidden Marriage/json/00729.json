Local famous perfumer, Bai Qiangwei as well as hot celebrities from the entertainment industry, Su Yimo and Song Lin were also seen posing for the cameras. Many big shots were out and about that night for Noble.</p><br/><p>Su Yimo matched the theme of the day and wore a dress with a Garden of Eden sort of vibe. It had flowery patterns all over it, making her look mysterious and elegant.</p><br/><p>\"Sis Yimo, you look really beautiful today!\"</p><br/><p>\"Nonsense, Yimo is beautiful everyday!\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s all thanks to Sis Yimo that we get to be here today!\"</p><br/><p>A few artistes were fawning all over Yimo.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re welcome. We\u2019re all colleagues,\" Su Yimo replied graciously.</p><br/><p>As they were chatting, someone asked, \"Oh, do you guys know who\u2019s the ambassador for Noble\u2019s new product? They\u2019ve been really secretive about it. No one in the industry knows who it is. How mysterious!\"</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s so secretive about it? Isn\u2019t it Li Yueling?\" Liang Biqin acted as if she knew all about it already.</p><br/><p>\"Li Yueling? Why is it someone from Starlight? Didn\u2019t anyone from Glory World audition? Sis Yimo is bound by some other contract, so why didn\u2019t you try it out, Biqin?\"</p><br/><p>Liang Biqin only managed an awkward, forced smile. She had gone for the audition but was rejected in the initial round.</p><br/><p>The person realized that she had said something wrong, so she followed up, \"Ah, you must have been busy with your movie at that time. It\u2019s unfortunate that you had no time!\"</p><br/><p>Liang Biqin\u2019s expression softened. \"Mmm, I was too busy at the time, so I didn\u2019t enter the auditions.\" Secretly, she was relieved that Noble\u2019s audition process was classified, so no one knew if she had even entered it or not\u2026</p><br/><p>As they were talking to each other, they saw two familiar people enter.</p><br/><p>\"Isn\u2019t that Ning Xi and Ling Zhizhi? Why are they here?\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s obvious! Ling Zhizhi couldn\u2019t stand Ning Xi having such bad taste, so she brought her here to teach her what\u2019s classy!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah! It\u2019s Director Cook!\" Their attention shifted to Noble\u2019s art director, Cook, who had suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s looking in our direction! He\u2019s coming over!\"</p><br/><p>Liang Biqin was excited as well but she acted calmly. \"Stop making a fuss out of it. My cousin is on good terms with Director Cook!\"</p><br/><p>Su Yimo stood up and greeted him, \"It\u2019s been some time, Mr. Cook.\"</p><br/><p>Cook shook her hands, smiling. \"We meet again, Ms. Su! Thank you for you and your friends\u2019 support!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re welcome!\"</p><br/><p>The artistes around her looked envious seeing how close Su Yimo was with Director Cook. Liang Biqin was feeling proud of her cousin.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m a little busy today, we\u2019ll talk again soon.\"</p><br/><p>Cook looked around anxiously and after a few exchanges of pleasantries, he excused himself from Su Yimo\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hey! My dear Xi! We finally meet again!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

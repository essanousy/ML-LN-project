God is helping you? And you don\u2019t want it? Just listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s expression only got colder, \u201cI need to repeat myself a second time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his brother get really angry, Lu Jingli quickly imitated a chicken pecking rice, nodding again and again. \u201cI\u2019ll destroy it\u2026\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll destroy it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t know what to say to this brother of his. Except for when he was in front of Ning Xi, h\u2019s brother had no idea how to be flexible!</p><br/><p>However, he is not the same. His mouth agreed, but of course he wouldn\u2019t really destroy it</p><br/><p>Hmph, he\u2019d keep it secretly\u2026\u2026one day it would come in handy!</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli sighed, suddenly a small figured dashed like a gust of wind from upstairs towards the front door\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAunty Xiao Xi is back?\u201d Lu Jingli quickly followed Little Treasure out.</p><br/><p>Looking out the door, it seems Ning Xi is really back, sitting in Jiang Muye\u2019s car.</p><br/><p>From the look of the two, nothing seems unusual. Jiang Muye seems to have drunk a lot wine, while Ning Xi seems quite sober.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi stepped out of the car, and picked up Little Treasure who rushed out to greet her looking distressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh darling, it\u2019s already past eleven. How come you\u2019re not asleep this late? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re were waiting for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Treasure wrapped his arms tightly around her neck, glaring at Jiang Muye, his expression alert and wary.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s frowned slightly. It\u2019s clearly unfair, this is Lu Ting Xiao\u2019s plot!</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli seeing Jiang Muye\u2019s thoughts, went and sympathetically patted his shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad. Who told you not to have a son?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye\u2019s heart thumped, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli leaned over and whispered in his ear, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, you like Ning Xi\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of panic flashed across Jiang Muye\u2019s face before he settled down. \u201cUncle, you must be joking. How can I like her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Jingli touched his chin, and looked interested. It was really strange! In the end what happened between these two. Jiang Muye obviously likes Ning Xi, but he really refuses to admit it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was about to carry Little Treasure into the house when suddenly her cell phone rang.</p><br/><p>She quickly answered it, \u201cHello, who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, is this Miss Ning Xi? Your boyfriend was in a car accident and is in our hospital! Please come as soon as possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi just looked confused: \u201cMy boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>As her voice faded, Lu Jingli, Jiang Muye, Lu Ting Xiao, and even Little Treasure\u2019s eyes all focused upon Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi, embarrassed quickly continued \u201cCough, are you sure you\u2019re not mistaken? I don\u2019t have a boyfriend!\u201d</p><br/><p>But the patient put down your number before going into a coma. Please hurry over! Our hospital address is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the end, the people on the other end rushed to hang up the phone. Ning Xi holding the cell phone, just stood there in the midst of the staring faces. \u201cI\u2019ll go! In the end, who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye leaning against his cars body tsked at her: \u201dWhich of your former boyfriends is it? He was infatuated enough to actually save your number huh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi swiftly kicked him, \u201cLess sarcasm!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, don\u2019t you have to go?\u201d Lu Jingli asked, his eyes aglow. Although a valid question, his expression is one of excitement!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

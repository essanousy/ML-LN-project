The media and your fans will be flooding the airport! You want me to pick you up? You want me to be torn up by them? Jiang Muye, I only dumped you once! It\u2019s not worth giving me such a hard time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I giving you a hard time? This is a free opportunity for you to become famous, something so many stars want but can\u2019t even get!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI. Don\u2019t. Need. It!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine! You\u2019re not coming, are you? Then I\u2019ll tell the whole world that you dumped me! Anyway I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m humiliated, I want to let everyone carry out justice for me!\u201d The other person said shamelessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s lungs were about to burst from anger. The stupidest thing she had ever done in her whole life was provoking a troublemaker like Jiang Muye.</p><br/><p>Did you think I wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with your cheap tricks?</p><br/><p>The corner of Ning Xi\u2019s mouth raised slightly as she chuckled, \u201cSure, you want me to fetch you? I\u2019ll go! Just don\u2019t regret it when the time comes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, it was easy enough to settle the matter with Jiang Muye. He was just unhappy about being dumped for the first time, so he wanted to take a little petty revenge. He would stop once he had enough. The thing that made her head hurt was the devil that had sent the diamond.</p><br/><p>Forget it, forget it. She wasn\u2019t going to bother with it until she had to!</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, there\u2019s someone looking\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>She heard the errand boy Xiao Li\u2019s pressurising voice the moment she came out of the corner, and she was so frightened she wanted to drop everything and run.</p><br/><p>Who was it this time?</p><br/><p>Will this ever end!?</p><br/><p>Everyone in the crew was suddenly full of energy, was there going to be something even more explosive this time?</p><br/><p>In the corner, Cui Caijing\u2019s expression was full of disdain, \u201cThese crude men only now how to throw out money! They\u2019re so low class!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Xi, h-hello!\u201d This time, it was a shy girl. Seeing that Ning Xi\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t too good, she even thought that she had done something wrong, and looked apprehensive.</p><br/><p>Facing a girl like that, Ning Xi couldn\u2019t vent her rage no matter how angry she was, \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Are you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to send you something.\u201d The girl opened up something white that looked like a thermos. Cool white mist floated out, revealing three bottles that looked like they contained fruit juice: red, yellow and green.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d The corner of Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched. She had seen too many palace dramas, so her first reaction was that someone was trying to poison her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was personally made by my little young master. There\u2019s watermelon juice, orange juice and green bean soup.\u201d The girl replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your little young master?\u201d Ning Xi was suspicious, and tried to recall if there were any little young masters who liked making fruit juice amongst the people she had offended.</p><br/><p>The girl indicated that she should read the note on the bottles.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi tore it off for a look, only to see an English word written on the note: \u2018fighting\u2019, with a heart shape drawn on the end.</p><br/><p>She could almost imagine the sender\u2019s shy expression, with pursed lips as he drew the heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s Little Treasure\u2026\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s gaze turned gentle in an instant, and her turbulent emotions finally calmed down.</p><br/><p>At first, she had been worried about being too high-profile at the start of her career and drawing unwanted trouble and gossip.</p><br/><p>Now that she thought about it, why should she care so much about the gazes of the people who didn\u2019t care about her? If she had to keep caring about what other people thought of her in this industry, wouldn\u2019t she die from exhaustion?</p><br/><p>Back then, she had cared too much about what the upper class socialites had thought about her, even as their gazes looked down on her. She had cared too much about her supposed biological parents\u2019 attitude towards her, and had regarded Su Yan\u2019s opinion too highly. It had caused her to feel even more inferior as time passed, and she had slowly lost her identity\u2026</p><br/><p>She had already understood this philosophy long ago, yet she had let a small incident shake her heart so much.</p><br/><p>She only had to be herself, keep a clear conscience, and one day, she would be able to prove herself with her own strength.</p><br/><p>She was fighting only for the people who cared about her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

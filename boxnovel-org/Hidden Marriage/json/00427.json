It was only with a closer look that people might be drawn to her cute face.</p><br/><p>While the owner did not know who she was, experience told him that she was some celebrity, and it didn't hurt that she looked quite wealthy. Even if she was not that famous, she would probably buy something pricey, so he served her personally.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi looked through the vast collection of jade ornaments displayed, and said, a little confused, \"My grandfather is celebrating his 70th birthday and I want to buy him a bracelet with jade beads. Do you have any recommendation?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes...of course!\" The owner quickly opened up the shelf and carefully took out a few bracelets, \"What a good timing that you\u2019re here now! We\u2019ve just received a new batch of the latest items,. Have a look at the colors, they're all top notch quality! They\u2019ll surely make you get into anyone's good books if you give it as a gift!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi did not really know much about jade ornaments, but according to the shop owner, they would cost quite a fortune, so she asked hesitantly, \"How much do each of them cost?\"</p><br/><p>\"The price is not exactly fixed but they are around one to two million dollars. Of course, they are better ones, so if you don\u2019t like these, I\u2019ll show you some others!\" The owner\u2019s eyes shone in glee.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the owner persisted on recommending her expensive jade ornaments, Ning Xi smiled awkwardly at him. Did she look like she was rich?</p><br/><p>\"Uhm, it\u2019s okay, do you have something cheaper?\" Ning Xi interrupted the owner\u2019s rattle of recommendations.</p><br/><p>\"Cheaper?\" the owner stopped for a bit and assessed Ning Xi. He then kept all the bracelets, but still replied her with a smile on his face, \"Sure, we have something cheaper! Take a look over here! The colors are a little bit off, but they are pretty good and the prices are reasonable too. Only around 7 to 800 thousand dollars! I\u2019ll even throw in a discount so you can get them at 600 thousand!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi pinched the area between her brows and went straight to the point, \"Something even cheaper. Do you have anything within the range of 150 thousand dollars?\"</p><br/><p>\"1...150 thousand dollars?\" The owner\u2019s smile collapsed after hearing that and even his tone changed, \"Pretty lady, while 150 thousand might seem a lot to you, at most, you can only fool those who aren\u2019t very well versed with jade ornaments. Such a small sum of money can\u2019t get you anything good! Plus, you\u2019re buying a gift for an elder, so you should invest more, especially for things like a jade bracelet. It\u2019s not something you should cut corners with!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Xi smiled, \"You\u2019re right, but the gift is more about the effort and the meaning, instead of the price, I'm giving my best, which means I\u2019ve put all my heart into this gift.\"</p><br/><p>The owner sarcastically laughed, but of course, he hid his scoff behind a hand so as not to make it too obvious. He closed the shelf and told her, \"Then, you can pick from this area. The items on this row here are all below 150 thousand dollars. That row over there is cheaper, if\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

For people who likes to eat radish, no matter how perfect the cabbage is, they will never like to eat cabbage\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Back then, he was quite confident that Ning Xi did have feelings for him, and that she was only finding an excuse, so he never thought deeply into that sentence.

How come you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also staying with the crew now, in the room above yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi was speechless, \u201cI\u2019m only staying with crew because the scenes are really important and tiring, so why the hell are you here to add trouble to the crew!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can save more time to game, okay?\u201d Jiang Muye had a tone as if it was ought to be.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! You win!\u201d Ning Xi held her thumbs up, then asked, \u201cSo, you didn\u2019t play your game, but ran here instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking of that, Jiang Muye had a look of being in bad luck, \u201cPlay what game ah! The internet speed is really slow! It made me lose five rounds and lost my rank! Quickly accompany me to the internet cafe and play throughout the night! Quick quick quick~~~\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi facepalmed, \u201cWhat play throughout the night ah, I\u2019m already getting ready to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is only nine plus, sleep what ah! Are you going or not? Who was the one who accompanied you to play with just one call in the middle of the night at 3am? It\u2019s only 9pm now and you aren\u2019t willing to accompany me? Ha\u2026\u2026\u201d Jiang Muye coldly laughed, and had an expression as if looking at his ex-lover who had betrayed him.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, she would need to repay him for accompanying her that time sooner or later!</p><br/><p>Ning Xi felt helpless, \u201cFine fine, I\u2019ll go alright? Wait a while, I go get changed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later, the two of them changed into inconspicuous clothing. Both of them wore mouth mask, and went into the internet cafe.</p><br/><p>The place they were at was the Film City, thus the internet cafe frequently had celebrities. The boss was not surprised seeing two person wearing mouth masks coming in the middle of nice, he did not ask for their identification in details, and let them inside directly.</p><br/><p>There were no more private rooms, hence the two of them found a cubicle each, sat down, and turned on the computers.</p><br/><p>It has been a long time since Ning Xi logged on, and she forgot her password. \u201cUh, Golden Hair, what\u2019s my password?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye speechlessly rolled his eyes at her, then directly typed on her keyboard and entered her password.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Ning Xi pressed the \u2018Enter\u2019 button on her keyboard and login.</p><br/><p>Once logged in, many system messages popped up. Ning Xi looked at all those windows that popped up and her face brightened, \u201cF***! Rich boy! Why did you send me so many skins? And all of them are legendary tier!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what she said, Jiang Muye exploded, \u201cYou idiot! I sent them to you as birthday present and you haven\u2019t even looked at it?

No wonder you forgot your password!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201d Feeling guilty, Ning Xi scratched her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019ve been busy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye looked at her with a cold expression, \u201cThey are all excuses, you clearly don\u2019t care about it!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

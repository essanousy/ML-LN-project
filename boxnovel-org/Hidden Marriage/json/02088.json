I didn\u2019t expect that pregnant people would have such weird interests. Put aside the fact that someone so gentle and ladylike like Ms. Ning would suddenly be interested in motorbikes\u2026 While being pregnant, you still wandered outside the city alone late at night on the bike.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo\u2019s calm expression finally showed a crack. Her face twitched intensely, but it was just a heartbeat before she returned to her flawlessly sad and grieving expression. \u201cSister, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I was just curious, so I learned more about it from a professional just for the fun of it. How could I have gone to ride it myself and even go out in the middle of the night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xueluo sneered in her heart. <em>Ha, Ning Xi, want to trap me? You think I\u2019m that dumb!?</em></p><br/><p>When Zhuang Lingyu saw that Ning Xi was getting more and more nonsensical, she looked even more upset. \u201cNing Xi, what are you trying to say with all this absurdity?! Even if Xueluo rode a motorbike late at night, what\u2019s that got to do with you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shrugged, then she said carelessly, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s got nothing to do with me. After all\u2026 who she hit\u2026 was not my child.\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant Ning Xi said that, the whispers in the room suddenly fell to a dead silence and Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s expression froze too.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, please turn off the lights for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s long hand stretched out and then the room was instantly pitch black.</p><br/><p>In the next second, Ning Xi lightly tapped on the phone in her hands, and a video was projected on the wide, white wall behind everyone.</p><br/><p>There was no audio from the video. It was probably at night, so the lighting was very fuzzy. The video was static for three seconds, then a black motorbike appeared in the projection.</p><br/><p>The instant she saw that motorbike, Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s pupils abruptly shrunk. \u201cThat bike\u2026 It\u2019s the one that hit me\u2026 It\u2019s the one that hit me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the entire accident had happened in a split second, she would definitely not forget how that bike looked like.</p><br/><p>When they heard Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s words, there was a commotion. Suddenly, everyone fixed their gazes on the wall.</p><br/><p>The scene seemed to show an uninhabited junkyard for cars. The owner of the bike first got down and then took off all the clothes she wore, even her gloves and helmet. Then, she kicked the motorbike down and threw a lighter towards it\u2026</p><br/><p>Bam! Everything vanished into the flames.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the rising flames all at once illuminated the face of the bike\u2019s owner.</p><br/><p>That was not a man, but a delicate-looking woman\u2026</p><br/><p>That was\u2026 Ning\u2026 Ning Xueluo!</p><br/><p>The instant they had a clear look of the face, everyone in the ward was stunned. Everyone stared in disbelief towards Ning Xueluo who was on the sick bed.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Lingyu\u2019s mouth was even wide open as she stared at the screen. She did not return to her senses for a long while.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 What is this? How could this person be Xueluo!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that face is Ning Xueluo! Earlier, when the fire was burning, you could see it clearly! After she took off her clothes outside, you could even tell from her belly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible\u2026 Impossible! This is impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The instant the projection on the wall lit up with this familiar scene, Ning Xueluo\u2019s expression had already changed. Within just a few short seconds of the video, she felt as if she had walked through hell. When her face was illuminated by the flames and appeared before everyone, she felt her soul leave her.</p></div>\n</div>"}

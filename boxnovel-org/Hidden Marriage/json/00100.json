And stop acting like you\u2019re some virtuous lady!\u201d Jiang Muye urged her like his pants were on fire.</p><br/><p>Speechless, the corner of Ning Xi\u2019s mouth twitched before she held onto the windowsill and threw herself out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye immediately pulled her over. After spinning her around a few times and seeing that there weren\u2019t any traces of night activities on her, he stared at her with a burning gaze, \u201cDid anything happen last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi almost fainted from being turned around in circles. She said unhappily, \u201cJiang Muye, it\u2019s so early in the morning, why are you throwing a fit out here instead of staying in bed? I was just sleeping peacefully, what could have happened to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>His veins were popping on his forehead as he said, \u201cNing Xi! Are you a pig? Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know how you got here last night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know!\u201d Ning Xi had an innocent expression.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye took in a deep breath before he could calm himself down. Gritting his teeth, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re so stupid, I wonder how you haven\u2019t been taken away by someone and sold already! It was Lu Tingxiao who carried you back personally last night!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ning Xi seemed to be a little scared, before she objected, \u201cSo what? Then it must have been my darling Little Treasure who couldn\u2019t bear to wake me and asked his dad to carry me back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since that had been the case when they were in the bar, where Little Treasure wouldn\u2019t let anyone else touch her except Lu Tingxiao, she didn\u2019t think much of this.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye almost expired from frustration, \u201cNing Xi, could you be a little more cautious? Lu Tingxiao clearly has some intentions towards you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi heaved a long sigh, before placing her arms on Jiang Muye\u2019s shoulders. She said with utmost sincerity, \u201cBrother, this older sister is aiming for the stars, I won\u2019t stop for any random love interests. Even if you kneel down and beg for me to be your aunt, I won\u2019t give you the chance, okay? Please stop with your delusions, take a shower and go back home to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard this, Jiang Muye\u2019s mood was complicated. While he heaved a sigh of relief, at the same time, he stared at her with a conflicted expression, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you really don\u2019t intend on marrying at all for the rest of your entire life? What if you meet someone you like? Ning Xiao Xi, this way of thinking is dangerous and you shouldn\u2019t be having thoughts like that, you know? Let me tell you, although your career is important, for a woman, marriage should be\u2026 AH\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi had been unable to resist any longer and had thrown a kick over, \u201cJiang Muye, are you done yet? Are you trying to pick a fight with me? I see that it\u2019s been too long since I beat you up and you\u2019re itching for a beating!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just beat me up yesterday!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I clearly didn\u2019t beat you enough the last time. This older sister is going to beat you into submission today, let\u2019s see if you still dare to spout nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye fled in terror, and suddenly looked behind her and shouted, \u201cUncle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi sneered sinisterly, \u201cUncle? Even if you cry uncle, no one\u2019s going to come help you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Ning Xi\u2019s claws were about to strike, Jiang Muye shouted loudly, \u201cNo\u2026 it\u2019s my uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi\u2019s back stiffened and she turned her head over mechanically. Lu Tingxiao was standing there in workout attire, sweat rolling down his skin. From the looks of it, he had just finished a morning jog.</p><br/><p>Since she had been caught red-handed on the scene beating up his nephew, Ning Xi tried to think of something to say. She immediately pointed at Jiang Muye and said, \u201cMr Lu, this guy came over early in the morning to smash the windows of your house. I discovered him and I was preparing to beat him up for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye glared at her, \u201cShameless\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you dare to claim that you didn\u2019t smash them!\u201d Ning Xi said sternly and righteously.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao reached out to remove a strand of grass in the girl\u2019s hair, before stroking her head with his large palm as if it was a natural thing to do, \u201cDon\u2019t fool around. Go and wash up, it\u2019s time for breakfast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYessir, I\u2019m going now!\u201d Pleased with herself, Ning Xi made a face at Jiang Muye before skipping away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Muye hated that he couldn\u2019t grab her and shout wildly at her: It\u2019s not once, nor twice but three freaking times! Lu Tingxiao is already acting so obvious, can\u2019t your freaking dog eyes see it?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

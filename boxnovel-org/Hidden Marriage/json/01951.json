Indeed, this was Xu Tao\u2019s way of doing things.</p><br/><p>This move was indeed incredibly savage.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Xi, how did you actually get chosen? In fact, Jace personally decided on you!\u201d Xu Tao followed after her and asked eagerly.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ning Xi explained the process in detail to Xu Tao who listened without even blinking once throughout.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When they left the private club, Ning Xi returned to Deer Town.</p><br/><p>After chatting with Jace for a long time, Ning Xi finally understood why parts of the casting for \u201cAssassin\u201d took place in China.</p><br/><p>According to Jace, his younger daughter, Caroline really like China, and some settings of the storyline in \u201cAssassin\u201d were actually in China.</p><br/><p>Of course, when \u201cAssassin\u201d officially began shooting and the storylines in China were finished, she would still need to follow the crew to the other countries to continue shooting at various locations.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it? Did it go well?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>The old Hollywood movie \u201cAssassin\u201d had once caused a sensation and Lu Tingxiao had seen it too. He also knew how much Ning Xi liked this movie. She had even studied the script for a long time for a minor role that did not have many scenes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoohoo, Darling\u2026 It didn\u2019t go too well. I didn\u2019t get chosen for the role that I auditioned for!\u201d Ning Xi wept and sighed as she went over, seeking for caresses and comfort.</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao naturally felt his heart ache for her and he quickly consoled her softly.</p><br/><p>Yet, the moment he finished, he saw the girl looking up to him slyly. There were no hints of sadness in her eyes at all. \u201cHehehe, even though I didn\u2019t get chosen for the role I auditioned for, the filming team has let me take on the role of the lead female assassin.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard this, even Lu Tingxiao was a little astonished.</p><br/><p>Initially, he thought that Ning Xi had failed at the audition. He would never have thought that she would get the role of the female lead instead.</p><br/><p>In Hollywood, Chinese artistes had a lower status. As everyone was aware, getting even a supporting role was hard, much less a leading role.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, do you know that today my idol unexpectedly invited me to personally meet him!?\u201d Ning Xi exclaimed excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cJace?\u201d Lu Tingxiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?!\u201d Ning Xi pouted as she wanted to boast to Lu Tingxiao without him guessing first.</p><br/><p>\u201cApart from Jace himself, who else could make you this excited?\u201d teased Lu Tingxiao in a pampering tone.</p><br/><p>He liked seeing the way her eyes lit up when she spoke about her work.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Jace was really such a gentleman and he\u2019s very friendly. He wasn\u2019t like what I imagined at all! He\u2019s just like a normal and very loving grandfather!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd did you know? The female lead, Caroline, was actually Jace\u2019s daughter but sadly, Caroline has already passed away\u2026\u201d Ning Xi\u2019s expression flashed with regret and she felt that it was a great pity. At the same time, she was even more determined to act her part well.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, I must perform this film to perfection.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, my wife can do it,\u201d Lu Tingxiao said, then he suddenly thought of something, and in his eyes was an unnoticeable gloom.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAssassin\u201d was highly efficient. Very soon, they informed Ning Xi to go over for a costume test.</p><br/><p>On that day, Ning Xi arrived early.</p><br/><p>In the makeup room, a Caucasian with the typical Western standards of beauty walked up to Ning Xi, her dark blue eyes examining Ning Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Chinese actress, Ning Xi!\u201d The Caucasian girl smiled at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Ning Xi,\u201d Ning Xi answered politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you seem to have been in Hollywood previously. Did you act in a movie, the one that was just released recently?\u201d The Caucasian girl hurled out her hand to Ning Xi.</p></div>\n</div>"}

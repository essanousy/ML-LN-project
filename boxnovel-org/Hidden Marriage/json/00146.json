Oh geez\u2026</p><br/><p>Her mind was in so much confusion that she didn\u2019t even know what kind of strange thoughts she was having\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you feeling unwell again?\u201d Seeing the situation, Lu Tingxiao immediately showed a tense expression.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi rubbed her temples, which had suddenly begun to throb. It wasn\u2019t as simple as feeling unwell. The surging tide that had risen again was even worse than the first one. Right now, in her vision, Lu Tingxiao had become one of the male leads in a shoujo manga; he even had his own moving background music and romantic pink cherry blossom special effects\u2026</p><br/><p>Her inner rationality fought intensely against his seductive pink glow; she felt as if she was about to get possessed by the devil.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ning Xi\u2019s breathing had suddenly quickened and that she was covered in sweat, Lu Tingxiao\u2019s expression abruptly changed, \u201cWhere exactly do you feel unwell? Weren\u2019t you all better just now? What\u2026 what kind of \u2018unwell\u2019 do you feel? Is it\u2026 that\u2026 or something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao spoke a little awkwardly, because he had just recalled the words she had said, that he was even scarier than aphrodisiacs.</p><br/><p>This was likely the greatest praise he had ever heard.</p><br/><p>With reddened eyes, Ning Xi stared straight at him without blinking.</p><br/><p>While getting stared at by that sort of gaze, Lu Tingxiao felt that a fire was about to light up in his body.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi shook her head forcefully and threw herself onto the bed behind her. She gazed at the ceiling above her helplessly, \u201cAy, I guess I still have more to bear with tonight\u2026 Lu Tingxiao, if I can\u2019t hold myself back any longer later, remember to knock me out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao muttered to himself, \u201cActually, I can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Xi immediately interrupted, \u201cStop stop stop, don\u2019t say anymore! Please, Big Boss Lu, spare me! This little one really can\u2019t bear any more of your flirting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao raised an eyebrow, \u201cWhat are you thinking? I was about to say that I can leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 oh\u2026\u201d Ning Xi rubbed her nose in embarrassment, then mumbled falteringly, \u201cBut\u2026 if I have to wait it out alone\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll be bored!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was too embarrassed to say that she would be scared alone.</p><br/><p>However, Lu Tingxiao understood why she felt uneasy and asked gently, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go home then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Go home\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Xi froze for a moment. In the instant that she had heard those two words, she had immediately thought of the Lu residence as if it was natural.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s forget about that, as I am right now\u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t want to taint that place with her current appearance.</p><br/><p>Ning Xi spotted the documents and laptop that Lu Tingxiao had placed by the bed, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do your work! I\u2019ll be fine after I meditate for a bit and adjust my body~\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao smiled, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>The regular rhythm of fingers tapping on a keyboard sounded in the quiet guest room, like the gentlest lullaby in the world.</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s expression was tranquil as she slowly shut her eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>After detecting that the breathing by his side had turned soft and steady, Lu Tingxiao stopped his actions and carefully covered her with a blanket.</p><br/><p>The girl muttered a little and subconsciously grabbed onto his fingers, \u201cLu Tingxiao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tingxiao\u2019s body stiffened as his expression became indescribable.</p><br/><p>She had called him by name.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m here. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Lu Tingxiao bent over and kissed the girl\u2019s lips with a gentle expression.</p><br/><p>However, there were dark clouds mixed in with that gentle expression of his\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

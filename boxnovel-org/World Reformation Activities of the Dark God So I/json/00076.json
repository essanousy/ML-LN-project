But now, that\u2019s different.</p><br/><p>I decided to name this inexplicable emotions as \u2018love\u2019.</p><br/><p>That definition returns my heart to serenity and it helps me out a bit.</p><br/><p>I love Haine-san, so I am happy when Haine-san protects me. I love Haine-san, so I end up being more worried about Haine-san than any other.</p><br/><p>By admitting my woman part, I was able to make an excuse of these feelings that should be scolded as a hero.</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you okay, Karen-san?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama, who had gotten up first, extended her hand to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I hurriedly take that hand.</p><br/><p>But, how pathetic of me. I should be the one protecting Founder-sama as the hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe ended up falling quite a few ways down. It looks like the materials had become a lot more brittle than I thought.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I feel like we fell from quite the height. I am surprised that we were able to come out safely from th\u2014- Ah.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I soon noticed the reason why.</p><br/><p>My rear was halfway buried -in sand. It is probably something that leaked from the desert. It had piled up and worked as a cushion to soften the impact of our fall.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026This is\u2026underground, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, and we have arrived. The place we were looking for in this journey, the Dark Underworld Country.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I pull up my rear from the sand and run to where Yorishiro-sama is and stand to her side, and then, follow that gaze of hers.</p><br/><p>What appeared in my sight was the remains of a city that reached far into the distance. In this space at the depths of the earth, there\u2019s many stone-made buildings. Most were partially destroyed or buried in sand; there was already no presence of life.</p><br/><p>But even in its current state, I can still understand that there were traces of life in the long past.</p><br/><p>Traces of humans living here.</p><br/><p>It would be more accurate to describe it as ruins. Historic ruins of a grand underground city.</p><br/><p>This is the place we were searching for, the Dark Underworld Country?</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible! Even when it is pitch black underground, I can still slightly tell its contour.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like there\u2019s moss growing on the surface of the buildings. It seems to be the type that gives off slight amounts of light. Karen-san, perk up your ears.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Being told this by Yorishiro-sama, I concentrate on my ears and\u2026hear some sort of damp sound.</p><br/><p>Could this be\u2026the sound of water?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be an underground water source. It seems like the few times that there\u2019s rain in the desert, it soaks into the sand and created a stream. Life appears in places where there\u2019s water. But well, it is mostly vegetation though.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Yorishiro-sama walks around as if confirming the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to the plants cleaning the air, we are able to breathe even when we are so below ground. Even in this dead metropolis, life still goes on -in a different form.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026as expected, just the light of the moss won\u2019t help in seeing well. We can\u2019t confirm our footing well either so\u2026wait please, I will make some light\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Saying this, I was about to pour light divine power to my holy sword but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c!! Stop it!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>I was suddenly yelled at by Yorishiro-sama and got scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you forget what happened just a few moments ago?! That shadow attacked us seeking for light, you know? If you shine your sword again, it will serve as a lighthouse and that child will once again come here-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Sorry!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It is exactly as Yorishiro-sama says.</p><br/><p>I could see that shadow-san jostling with Haine-san when the floor crumbled and we were falling.</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t suffer a single injury, so that shadow-san must be safe as well, and there\u2019s a high chance that it is loitering around this city somewhere.</p><br/><p>It happened just a few moments ago, and yet, why am I messing up now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, what should we do now, Yorishiro-sama? It is good that we arrived at the Underworld Country, but the passage to the entrance has collapsed, and returning is impossible now. On top of that, if such an unknown *monster* like that is loitering around, it is important to protect ourselves, you know?\u201d (Karen) &lt;monster here is written in japanese, instead of the usual \u2018monster\u2019 in engrish&gt;</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. We have Haine-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe ended up separated from him, but that\u2019s probably the best option right now. He has an ethereal flashlight with him. If he keeps it on all the time, the shadow should be lured to it and target Haine-san. If it\u2019s one vs one, he can show his real strength as much as he wants.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>I see\u2026</p><br/><p>Against that shadow that absorbs light, I am only a deadweight.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that time, we should keep hidden. There\u2019s no need to get worried about the matter of getting out of here either. Haine-san will definitely manage something.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are throwing all of it to Haine-san\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>When I let out what I was thinking right out of my mouth, Yorishiro-sama giggles in a joking manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you know, that\u2019s exactly how it is, right? That person can resolve anything. Save the world when it is in peril, and even the worries of women.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>Only a short time has passed since I met Haine-san, but who knows how many times he has already saved me.</p><br/><p>He is a lot more of a hero than me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person\u2026is a lot more of a God\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><ul><li>77: The one that the Gods have approved</li></ul><br/><p>At any rate, Yorishiro-sama and I -Kourin Karen- decided to investigate the historic ruins of the Underworld Country that\u2019s in front of us.</p><br/><p>I am also bothered by that shadow that calls itself the Dark God Entropy, but our original objective was to find this city, and investigate it.</p><br/><p>Why did this city fall to ruins? Why did it get buried deep underground?</p><br/><p>If we are able to unveil the truth by investigating the ruins, we might be able to get closer to the identity of that shadow.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama and I walk at what might have been the path of a street in the city.</p><br/><p>It goes through the middle and the width of the road is big.</p><br/><p>In the days that the city was still alive, I think that many people had moved back and forth on this road.</p><br/><p>But right now, it is a quiet space where there\u2019s only rubble and sand scattered around.</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama, be careful. It is dark and we can\u2019t see what\u2019s at our feet.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, then, want to hold hands as we walk?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Without even knowing, I ended up holding hands with Yorishiro-sama as we walk.</p><br/><p>For some strange reason, this is making my heart race.</p><br/><p>Even if I am holding hands with someone, that other person is a girl like me, moreover, I have my heart set on Haine-san, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>As expected, is it because Yorishiro-sama is way too beautiful?</p><br/><p>Even in the eyes of a person of the same sex, Yorishiro-sama is transcendentally beautiful. I thought that way even when she was normally covering her face with a veil. When she took that veil off, that beauty of hers surpassed my imagination. So unfair.</p><br/><p>If a person hides her face in normal basis, you would imagine that person as being incredibly beautiful, so isn\u2019t the hurdle of beauty supposed to increase when that person reveals her face?</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufufu\u2026walking side by side like this\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe look like friends, don\u2019t we?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Y-Yes?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I have only been saying \u2018yes\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-T-T-That\u2019s too much of an h-h-h-honor! I am a hero and Yorishiro-sama is a Founder! I pledged at the hero investiture that I would devote my sword to Yorishiro-sama\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra Ara, that\u2019s the old stiff Karen-san -desu wa ne. But walking with our hands held like this, seeing each other\u2019s naked bodies, and most importantly, loving the same man; isn\u2019t this already on the level where it is okay to call us the best of friends?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Even if she tells me that, as I thought, someone like me being the friend of Yorishiro-sama is just unthinkable.</p><br/><p>A friend is, putting it in other words, an equal person.</p><br/><p>No matter how I think about it, I can\u2019t consider Yorishiro-sama as an equal to me.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s the Founder and Hero standing, but there\u2019s also what I said before, even if I were to take away the beauty part, I am still far from reaching her level.</p><br/><p>For example, in the time of the idol strife, when we were fighting together with Celestis, I was overwhelmed by that person\u2019s flashiness and refined charm.</p><br/><p>Even with that, I didn\u2019t want to lose as a woman in front of Haine-san, so I ended up saying \u2018I win\u2019. I was just acting tough there.</p><br/><p>And right now, in front of the beauty of Yorishiro-sama, I can\u2019t even act tough.</p><br/><p>A perfect beauty that would make you wonder if she isn\u2019t actually the very representation of a Goddess. Moreover, this person doesn\u2019t only have possess beauty and status.</p><br/><p>She is also perfect in strength.</p><br/><p>Travelling together with her in this occasion, this fact was made even clearer. This person surpasses me -a hero- by lengths and bounds, and her ability to control light divine power is good.</p><br/><p>Even that skill of destroying the floor at the battle of the shadow-san, Yorishiro-sama doesn\u2019t have a divine tool like the holy sword Saint-George, and yet, she was able to create such destruction with her bare hands.</p><br/><p>Normally, no matter how much light element number you have, without a divine tool that amplifies it, a person can\u2019t can\u2019t bring out enough divine power to destroy things.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama overturned such norm.</p><br/><p>She probably possesses light element that surpasses mine by a lot; a person that\u2019s rarely born with high affinity of her light element.</p><br/><p>Even in the \u2018Needle of Guidance\u2019, at first, it was supposed to be me and Yorishiro-sama pouring divine power together, and yet, it ended up with Yorishiro-sama doing it on her own all the way here.</p><br/><p>If Yorishiro-sama was not the Founder, she would have been the light hero, no doubt.</p><br/><p>Thinking that way, my confidence decreases more and more.</p><br/><p>Even Haine-san, he definitely likes her more\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, it looks like I have turned your mood sour.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The hand of Yorishiro-sama slips away from my fingers.</p><br/><p>This is bad. Did my face show how I felt?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t worry. Haine-san will definitely choose you.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA long time ago, I committed a sin. A big sin that I wouldn\u2019t be able to atone for even if I tried to atone for it. He\u2026still doesn\u2019t know about the details of this sin of mine. But he will know of it in time. When he learns of it, he will not forgive me.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The underground city is dark so I was unable to confirm the expression of Yorishiro-sama well.</p><br/><p>But for some reason, I thought that Yorishiro-sama was probably crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t be together with Haine-san. Being pampered by him is fun and it makes me happy, but that\u2019s as far as I\u2019m allowed to step into. I can\u2019t go further than that. When Haine-san learns about everything and begins to hate me, I won\u2019t be able to take it.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t understand the full extent of Yorishiro-sama\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what she means about \u2018a big sin\u2019, and in the first place, I can\u2019t imagine the Light Founder Yorishiro-sama committing a sin, whether it is big or small.</p><br/><p>But she is most likely\u2026unable to forgive herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, Karen-san, I will cheer you on. Even if I am not by his side, I would be glad of his happiness after all. It might be a rude way of saying this to Karen-san though\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>I hold the hand of Yorishiro-sama tightly.</p><br/><p>The force was so strong, I ended up surprising Yorishiro-sama. But, I can\u2019t stop this feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama! Please become my friend!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly speaking, I don\u2019t understand well what Yorishiro-sama was saying. What I do understand is that Yorishiro-sama is a good person!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>If that weren\u2019t the case, she wouldn\u2019t have sent kind words towards me so many times, she wouldn\u2019t have played together with me.</p><br/><p>Being pampered by Haine-san together with Yorishiro was truly fun.</p><br/><p>If it were with someone who is lying to herself, I wouldn\u2019t have had that much fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, Yorishiro-sama, please become my friend. Let\u2019s have Haine-san pamper us and trouble us together!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Yorishiro-sama has committed a mistake, I can\u2019t say something as presumptuous as: \u2018I forgive Yorishiro-sama\u2019. But, I can at least apologize with you as a friend! Please give me the qualification to do that, Yorishiro-sama!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>And Haine-san will definitely accept whatever it is.</p><br/><p>He is the person I have fallen in love with after all.</p><br/><p>It is okay for both Yorishiro-sama and I to be happy!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief, you really are\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>It was so dark, I couldn\u2019t see the expression of Yorishiro-sama well.</p><br/><p>But, from the hand that I was holding, I could tell that the strength she held me with had strengthened.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You are truly my hero-desu wa ne.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-73-75-underworld-down-slope\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 73-75 - Underworld down-slope\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-78-79-i-play-by-myself\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 78-79 - I play by myself\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236275\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

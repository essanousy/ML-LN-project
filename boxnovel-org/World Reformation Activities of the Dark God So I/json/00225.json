The reason, we have stepped into unknown land.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Ah, this is bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have arrived at Haine-san\u2019s room!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go doing whatever you want, okay?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Is what I warn, but I don\u2019t think it will show any result. After all, the women here are: Yorishiro, Karen-san, and Ates.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san\u2019s room!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It looks like she just noticed that reality, Karen-san\u2019s expression implodes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm uhm uhm, is that the place where when you arrive, all your wishes will come true?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The world beyond the horizon that everyone wants to go to, that is Haine\u2019s room!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not true.</p><br/><p>Why are you classifying my room as an Utopia all on your own?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t take notice because I was concentrated on my hate towards Ates-san, but once I am conscious of it, I can tell that I am being touched by the smell of Haine-san from inside my lungs and it is preading through my whole body!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go saying such scary things!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san was slowly entering a dangerous state.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that we are here, there\u2019s only one thing to do-desu wa, Karen-san! This is a journey! Like the adventurers that found the Golden City!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means it is pillaging time, right?! Like the bandits attacking the city!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Stop it!</p><br/><p>A man also has its privacy, so don\u2019t go searching here and there!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Haine-san.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates tries to calm me down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the first one that invaded this room. Everything that would trouble Haine-san if seen, has all been secured by me!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that something you say with a straight face?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>This group of damn trespassers!</p><br/><p>Just as I was thinking about throwing them all out the window, a smooth voice resonated.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A girl nervously appears from the kitchen \u2013it is Doraha.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you also came here\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s obvious. Doraha has been following Yorishiro like a shadow lately after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly sorry. I thought I would pour tea for everyone\u2026\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>This girl is also a special cookie of her own.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, I raised my voice and my throat has dried now.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to have you do that. Allow me to do the tea pouring.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Is what Karen-san says as she approaches, but Doraha as expected had a troubled expression.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026There\u2019s none.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201cNone?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no tea leaves. Instead, there\u2019s something like this\u2026\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>What Doraha places out was a single pot.</p><br/><p>Since it was made of transparent glass, it was easy to see what was inside. The black beans that were completely filling up the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026..!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Coffee beans.</p><br/><p>Why are Yorishiro and Karen-san making such a bitter expression?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Haine-san, you can drink something like coffee?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u2018Something like\u2019?!</p><br/><p>Did she say \u2018something like\u2019?!</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you know, it is bitter. How to say it, it is like it leaves an earth-like feeling in your mouth.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bitterness is the good part of it. It clears your mind, and it is great to wake you up.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Well, it is also to enjoy the deep taste that comes after the bitterness though.</p><br/><p>But even with that, Karen-san was looking at me as if I had come from another world as she said\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026tea is definitely the better tasting one. Coffee is just bitter.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Karen-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro joins in.</p><br/><p>\u201cTonight, let\u2019s try delighting on coffee.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>No, just leave already.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it thoroughly Karen-san. Not sharing the same likes in food as the person you love has a risk of them looking at you with bad eyes. Difference in values. It might become a reason for divorce!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Worrying about those things before marrying.</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Right! There\u2019s nothing bad in challenging it right now while I can! \u2026Haine-san!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOne cup-full of coffee please! And make it a real deep one!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Even if you order it in such a specially energetic manner\u2026hah, can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>I decided on making coffee at once.</p><br/><p>The coffee beans are already roasted, so I crush them with the mill and turn them into powder. After that, I just have to drip it, but in that part, I take out the espresso machine.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c?!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, the gaze of the girls gather all at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?! That kettle-like thing!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Is that a tool of an ancient civilization?! Haine-san, don\u2019t tell me you are bringing out forbidden knowledge?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>What are these people talking about.</p><br/><p>This espresso machine is an actual present from Hydra Ville.</p><br/><p>With this, I can use the deep coffee beans of Ishtar Blaze that I was given a lot of by Sasae-chan\u2019s Oba-san, extract them quickly, and make a deep espresso.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu, today was made nicely as well.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It looks like there\u2019s some nice stickiness to it.</p><br/><p>From the spout of the espresso machine, a dark liquid is poured into the cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, Haine-san, isn\u2019t this cup pretty small?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it is an espresso.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>As if saying \u2018here you go, drink\u2019, I slide the cups to the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, go ahead!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no! Yorishiro-sama, you first!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Since coming here, it has been an outbreak of calamities.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t care, so just drink it or it will get cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, you two are such children.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one coming out at this moment was the wicked woman who had stayed in silence until now.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cAtes-san!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCoffee can\u2019t be enjoyed by the tongue of children; it is the drink of the chosen ones.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>No, it isn\u2019t that big of a deal.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will accept the coffee that Haine-san has put his heart and soul in pouring. The two of you should get start getting used to it by first training with the sourness of the strawberries on cakes.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cGunununu!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain saying whatever you want!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The reason they can\u2019t fight back at the offensive of the enemy must be because of the bitterness of the coffee.</p><br/><p>With the bitter gazes at the sides, Ates takes the cup into her hand and, hesitantly, places her lips on it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Bitter.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Oi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! You now just said it was bitter! It is bitter huh! It is bitter for Ates-sama too huh!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, you can\u2019t handle it either. You false-bravado woman! If you keep being such a vain person, you will get your legs caught up someday! And in reality, you have failed once already, so learn some restrain!!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>As if the cover had been torn up, the women begin to go all \u2018gya gya\u2019. As they say: one is company, two is group, three is a crowd.</p><br/><p>I had no way of stopping that noisy fight, so I just watch over it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Haine-sama, I tried doing it as you taught me.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201cNice, good job.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I drink the coffee that Doraha had newly made.</p><br/><p>Bitter.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s what makes it tasty.</p><br/><p>Why do these girls not understand the greatness of this?</p><ul><li>226: A pleasant talk that happens only once \u2013 Second part</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, can you please leave already?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I say this towards these three holy women that still remain in my room.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine? How about we just stay in Haine-san\u2019s room for today?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026My room only has one bed though.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a problem in that?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only problems here.</p><br/><p>This Light Founder, does she want to tie the deal with me so much?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, right now this room is like the inside of a box. As long as you don\u2019t open it, no one will know what\u2019s inside.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, as long as the doors and windows are not opened and it is not possible to peek inside, the fact that we did perverted things with Haine-san will be mixed with a reality where we haven\u2019t done perverted things. And so, even if we were to actually do perverted things, there\u2019s no problem at all!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>That doesn\u2019t even work as sophistry.</p><br/><p>Regardless of what the people outside the box thing, I would be settling my own reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Haine-san is trying to say this, right?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates joins the fray.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want this woman to say one more word, and yet, for some reason, she joins Yorishiro in attacking me like crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you are saying is that you will be ravishing Yorishiro-sama, Karen-san, and I, so the argument of the box is not necessary!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cHeck no!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>A straight ball!</p><br/><p>After the sophistry of Yorishiro, there comes the straight ball of Ates.</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you two actually pretty in sync?!</p><br/><p>Or more like, just go! I want to enjoy the solace of my room at the very least!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Yorishiro-sama and Ates-sama, staying in Haine-san\u2019s room like this would be improper!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san reproaches the two wicked women that have a messed up conception of chastity.</p><br/><p>As expected, she is the actual holy woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cCause\u2026! I haven\u2019t brought my pajama over! If I knew, I would have brought the cutest one I have! The super cute one I bought at Hydra Ville that has laces!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The gist of it was slightly deviated!</p><br/><p>\u201cAra ara, what a cute hero. Even though a pajama would soon be stripped off.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates once again comes out with her blunt words, but in response, Karen-san\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Karen-san was confused, unable to understand the words of Ates, and that led to Ates being the one bewildered.</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Looks like you are a tougher opponent than I thought, Karen-san! Is this the power of an airhead?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly! Sleeping with my casual clothes would be improper and I won\u2019t condone that! It would make wrinkles in my skirt!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I am saying, you should just go nake\u2014-Gnnhhh!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>It was reaching a territory that couldn\u2019t be ignored, so Yorishiro poked Ates\u2019 side.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026*Cough*. Then, how about we do this? Bring the pajama over.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBring it over? Who will?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, just watch. Doraha, send a command to that person.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The silent as a shadow Doraha gave a short response of \u2018yes\u2019, and takes out the mass produced ethereal communication device and made a call somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Parent bird to chick; \u2018the falcon has descended\u2019. I repeat \u2018the falcon has flown\u2019.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Which one is it. There\u2019s no repeating there.</p><br/><p>After finishing what seemed to be a coded transmission of sorts, the sound of knocking could be heard from the door of my room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>When I open to see who it is, there was a single maid standing at the front of the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy a maid?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>But wait\u2026this girl wearing maid clothes\u2026I feel like I have seen her before? Moreover, recently.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah, Mina!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is Platina Mina. Thanks for last time.\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this the woman that was acting as the referee in the previous new and old heroes match.</p><br/><p>It is the girl that brought out a bomb the moment the victory of the current heroes was set and made things a mess.</p><br/><p>After that, it was confirmed that this was the deed of the contra-reconciliation side, so it became one of the ingredients in increasing their blame.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you in maid clothes?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cFufufu, Haine-san, to think that you would order a prostitute to cosplay as a maid; you have quite the nice hobbies\u2014Guhoo!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates said something lacking manners, so I poked her side.</p><br/><p>And so, about the matter of Mina being a maid\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026I was originally working as a grunt in the Light Church. How to say it, being a maid is more of my main job\u2026\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>Ah, so that\u2019s what it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as Yorishiro-sama ordered, I have brought one sleepwear and a stay-over set.\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work. We might still have need for you, so be on standby.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026! I am already outside my work-time period though!\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>So she was the one that was called just now huh.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, after the bomb incident she made herself, I had some business so I left her with Yorishiro, but I don\u2019t know what happened after.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if Mina-san caused the explosion, she was simply a throw-away pawn used by the contra-reconciliation side. Due to Yorishiro-sama\u2019s bountiful consideration, she was pardoned.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>The shadow Doraha explains it to me.</p><br/><p>She is already beginning to become the lubricant in this group.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer original job was that of a pawn\u2014I mean, maid. So she was assigned as the direct maid of Yorishiro-sama. The reason why she appeared tonight is due to those kind of circumstances.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Direct control of the Founder, she says.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a big promotion for a maid.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it okay? Even if she was used, to give such treatment to a person that actually stood against the current order? Won\u2019t it give a bad example?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is in the direct command of Yorishiro-sama, you know?\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think she will get treated well?\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Right. My thought pattern was incorrect.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like you people are saying something incredibly rude about me, but this is something that I thought deeply about, you know?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>While saying this, Yorishiro hugs Mina who was standing at her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cHywawawa!\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes-san is holding the depths of this girl after all. There\u2019s the need for me to keep supervision on her at my side.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Now that she mentions it! After the incident with the explosion, when we tried to have Mina spit out the details about the person behind it, Ates had suddenly appeared and, with a single glare, she was silenced.</p><br/><p>This without doubt means that Ates has grasped something important of Ates!</p><br/><p>Maybe she has her parents held hostage? Or it might be that Ates holds an important secret of her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fufufu.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And Ates who was here made another suggestive gaze. As if a predator was glaring at its prey. And that prey that is Mina was sweating bullets.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-A-Ates-sama!\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, little kitten?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, as I thought, I can\u2019t!! I am sorry, Yorishiro-sama! I can\u2019t live without Ates-sama!!!\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>Is what she said as the maid Mina rubs her face onto the legs of Ates while crying.</p><br/><p>What is this?</p><br/><p>\u201cMina-san had been under the command of Ates-sama for a brief period of time.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Even if you tell me that\u2026</p><br/><p>I got an explanation from Doraha, and yet, I can\u2019t understand the situation at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Ates-sama brought their relationship to that in order to utilize Mina-san, but now, Mina-san is the slave of Ates-sama. If she doesn\u2019t receive the love of Ates-sama, she will fall into withdrawal symptoms.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Uwa!</p><br/><p>Because of that, she closed her mouth completely for the sake of Ates?!</p><br/><p>Uwa\u2026Ueeeeh\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I will do my best for her sake!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro once again hugs Mina tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMina-san has been enslaved by Ates-san, in that case, by having me enslave her, I will have her break free of her withdrawal symptoms. The reason why I had her be my personal maid is also because of that.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cUse poison to deal with poison?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t find any more befitting words to describe this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you do that, Yorishiro-sama. She is my little kitten after all. I won\u2019t let you unpoison her.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen try stealing her away from me. Let\u2019s see which enslaving power is the strongest; yours or mine. This is a match to determine which one has the strongest poison.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The people themselves called it poison.</p><br/><p>Ates was hugging her from the front, and Yorishiro was hugging her from behind, ending with Mina-san in the middle of that sandwich.</p><br/><p>\u201cGyaaaa!! Yorishiro-sama! Ates-sama! This is bad, this is dangerous! This is heaven!! Yorishiro-sama\u2019s softness and Ates-sama\u2019s softness are attacking me from both sides!! My blood is being nourished by both nutrients!!\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>\u2026When humans get way too happy, they begin to scream huh.</p><br/><p>I do have my share of experiences as well though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Mina-san did can be considered unforgivable, but if we think of that as a punishment, well, I would say it is fitting.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u2026Right, I also concur with Doraha\u2019s opinion.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not watch those three wild cats in their silly ruckus anymore.</p><br/><p>Thanks to these, Karen-san, who had been silent all this time, had finally spoken.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, I don\u2019t understand well, but\u2026what in the world is going on?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine for you to not understand.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to understand the taste of this woman called Mina at all.</p><br/><p>If that concept were to be digested in Karen-san\u2019s head, the Hero Alliance would fall. There\u2019s one member in the group that would wish for this kind of development after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Mina had escaped from the strange situation of being sandwiched by the Light Founder and the previous hero while having faint breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026Hah\u2026! Why am I being put through this?!\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I want to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, your throat must be dry after all that mess. Drink this coffee.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, thank you very much!\u201d (Mina)</p><br/><p>Mina drank the espresso I gave her in one gulp.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, you got a nice way of drinking there.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing nice about it though. Espresso is supposed to be drunk that way, right? It went smoothly down my throat, it was pretty well made. I like more the style of putting sugar before drinking though!

It is a foreign desolated place faraway.</p><br/><p>While advancing through a desolate land where there\u2019s no one, I say this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd with that, I erased Mantle. If I want to erase a God, this is the only method there is.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sole power that can kill Gods huh. To think that you held such a power, as expected of the Dark God that stands at the summit of the six Gods of Creation.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva, who in the past was in awe of my strength and wanted to surpass it, said this.</p><br/><p>We were riding flying machines and driving on the sand parallel to each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cMantle wasn\u2019t evil, but she was even more dangerous than that. More dangerous than even Nova and Coacervate who had clear animosity towards humans. I understand the feeling of Haine-san wanting to erase her.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro was riding at the back of the flying machine I am driving, holding my back tightly.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro, Shiva, and I; with these group, we were pressing forward on an untrodden land.</p><br/><p>Two of the Founders that govern the Grand Churches of the world were out of their posts which is a big problem, but even if we have to be slightly pushy in this, we have to make this mission succeed.</p><br/><p>It is in order to bring back to this world one of the six Gods of Creation that is missing; Mother Earth Mantle.</p><br/><p>We had come to a place that\u2019s far from Apollon City and Rudras Metropolis \u2014the Nameless Desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long has it been since the last time we came here?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Sand as far as you can see. Due to the intense heat and dryness, this is a land of death that doesn\u2019t allow anyone who steps into it to return alive.</p><br/><p>A desertified area that takes up a good percent of the continent. That is the Nameless Desert.</p><br/><p>Normally, no one would step into it. You would treasure your life that you wouldn\u2019t do something like that. In the first place, there\u2019s no kind of task that would require you to enter this sand-filled place.</p><br/><p>And so, in this desert where no one would actually come to, I did actually have a task I had to perform.</p><br/><p>The first time, it was to journey into the Underworld Country; and the second one\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously, why did we come to such a place?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva mutters this as he wipes the sweat off his forehead.</p><br/><p>Because of the heat, he was irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind the reviving of Mantle. She easily gets swayed, so as long as she gets revived, there\u2019s plenty chance to have her cooperate. But why did we come to the Nameless Desert? Is there some sort of relation with her here?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat made this place into a desert was the divine power of Mantle.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro\u2019s statement made the eyes of Shiva go wide with an \u2018eh?\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must remember what happened here as well, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dark Underworld Country!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You four Base Elements destroyed that nation and a lone hero had crossed over a line that shouldn\u2019t have been crossed. Going berserk with the power of shadows that is passed down in the Dark nation, she was about to engulf the whole world in shadows.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>In order to avoid that, Inflation sealed the shadow fiend with the whole Dark Underworld Country.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, the one who helped in that was Mantle.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy having Mantle make all this place into a desert, I had her help out in sinking the Underworld Country deep down. Since then, she has been pouring divine power into this desert for more than a millenia, and this place that was originally fertile, has been able to maintain its desertified state.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>She was doing something like that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then, the reason why Mantle used things like Golems to obtain more prayers than others was because she was being dried up by this?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to maintain this Nameless Desert, she had to utilize quite a good amount of divine power after all.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cSo heartless!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t you the one who ordered her to do that, Yorishiro?!</p><br/><p>With the order of the Light Goddess that is at a higher hierarchy from Mantle, she was made to utilize a large amount of divine power!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it was necessary to go to such lengths to seal the Underworld Country.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>She not only literally sunk the city, but she also made the whole place into a desert so that no one would get close to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now that Mantle has been erased, it looks like this desert is slowly regaining its life.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro has stepped down from the flying machine, and with her feet on the sand, she could feel the life in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a century more, the Nameless Desert will regain its lifeforce completely and will revive into a land filled with green. Just like the time when the Underworld Country was thriving.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, it would be slightly problematic.</p><br/><p>A lot of people would come here and it will end up with them seeing \u2018it\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that, but in the end, what does this have to do with reviving Mantle? With the explanation just now, I couldn\u2019t pick up anything about that.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva was even more irritated as he wiped off his sweat.</p><br/><p>Right, let\u2019s enter the main topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason we came to the Nameless Desert was because of this.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro raised her hand at a place that at a glance had nothing and muttered something.</p><br/><p>When she did that, cracks appeared in the space and broke just like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t something to be surprised about, don\u2019t you think. With my light divine power, I created a barrier that twisted the direction of the light. Thanks to this, humans and animals can\u2019t detect this even when it is right before their eyes.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>With that barrier released, what was inside the barrier was now clear for us to see.</p><br/><p>A dark sphere floating in this desolate desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026! This is\u2026!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t carelessly get close to it, okay? If you get caught in its area of gravity pull, you would be swallowed along with your God soul and be unable to return.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. What was in this Nameless Desert was a black hole.</p><br/><p>What I had created at the Earth capital, Ishtar Blaze. It is the exact same as the one that absorbed and erased Mother Earth Mantle and its subordinate Grandma Wood.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter things had calmed down in Ishtar Blaze, I moved it all the way here.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The black hole that looked as if it had disappeared on its own had actually not disappeared. In reality, I made it look as if it had and moved it all the way here.</p><br/><p>It took me my all to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is in this desert, no one would come here on a whim after all. Just in case, I asked Yorishiro to make an optical camouflage. Made in order to not have anyone get accidentally swallowed by it.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>There was no more convenient place than this Nameless Desert where no one would come to.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Why did you do that?!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva asked me with a pale face.</p><br/><p>That question was natural, and I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t erase it.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>A black hole I have created once.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t erase it on my own will. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to use it as much as possible. Because once it is created, it will be existing almost eternally.\u201d (Haine)</p><ul><li>254: God Scale</li></ul><br/><p>There\u2019s a black hole floating in front of us.</p><br/><p>The sand below it had already all been swallowed within the gravity range of it and formed a big gorge like that of a crater.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt took me quite a lot of effort, you know. I had to bring it all the way from Ishtar Blaze to here.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Even now, this thing would grab anyone that enters its territory and would swallow it whole.</p><br/><p>Whether it is an object or a living being; whether it has form or not.</p><br/><p>A black hole doesn\u2019t have likes or dislikes; it is the worst kind of glutton.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing has continued to exist since the time Mantle was swallowed by it in Ishtar Blaze.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro who was looking at the dark sphere like us said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn attack that once it is done you can\u2019t erase it\u2026 The divine power attacks of us four Base Elements and the Light Goddess would disappear on their own once they fulfill their purpose!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Light can simply melt into the equal elements that are in nature after all. Even dark matter follows that rule. Darkness melts into darkness.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>But the black hole is different.</p><br/><p>That is something that is completely separate from darkness. It swallows everything -even darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe original purpose of the Black Hole is to erase the world. When the creator Entropy judges that \u2018this world was a failure\u2019, this is the reset switch that brings it all back to zero.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBy no means is it a method to destroy something specific.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The Black Hole is way too strong of a measure to use as an attack.</p><br/><p>It would be like using a bomb to kill an insect running around your house. Doing that would create damage to the house itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Black Hole is a serious problem to the world. It will continue to exist, swallowing everything in this world after all.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI-Is there really no way to erase it? Right, if it\u2019s the light element that can negate the darkness element\u2026!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped that Shiva\u2019s face would turn pale blue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is impossible.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The Light Goddess herself frankly states.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to destroy the Black Hole with light element, there\u2019s the need to hit the compressed dark matter that serves as the core with light divine power. But before that happens, the Black Hole will catch the light with its gravity and will imprison the light in its Schwarzschild radius.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Thus, the light will fall into eternal movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut well, this one was simply made to defeat Mantle without destroying the world, so it was created to its minimal capacity. Putting it in words, it would be like the weakest out of the weakest Black Holes. If it is on this level, I thought that maybe light divine power would manage to reach its dark matter core, but\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>And in reality, I had brought Yorishiro here once and asked her to do it, but even with the highest output of Yorishiro, she couldn\u2019t manage to break through the high gravity of the Black Hole and ended up being swallowed.</p><br/><p>Because of that, I had no choice but to ask Yorishiro to create a camouflaging barrier.</p><br/><p>In the end, even when it was the weakest Black Hole, there was no method to eliminate it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026this Black Hole will exist here for eternity?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cAccurately speaking, it won\u2019t be eternal though.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>In order to give Shiva peace of mind, I decided on telling him the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Black Hole will slowly disappear on its own after all. Humans and Gods can\u2019t do anything about it, but there\u2019s the possibility of time resolving it.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack Holes will disappear on their own after some time, you say\u2026 and, how long is that?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Hm, if I calculate it with this size, it would be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, around 100,000 years, maybe.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cA hund\u2014!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>For some reason, the face of Shiva got even paler.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, the only one who would think that that amount of time is nothing is you-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I now understand why he wasn\u2019t so angry for being sealed 1,600 years!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva wiped off the sweat that trickled down his chin, but it looks like that sweat wasn\u2019t simply from the heat of the desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I think that you now understand that a Black Hole is extremely troublesome, but the problem comes from here on.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Our objective for coming here is obviously not to do something about this Black Hole.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Mother Earth Mantle.</p><br/><p>To bring back the Earth Goddess that was swallowed by this Black Hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly speaking, I don\u2019t know what happened to Mantle who disappeared inside this thing.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Even as the very person that created it, I still don\u2019t know what happens to the things that this Black Hole absorbs.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s three possibilities.</p><br/><p>The first one; Mantle who was caught by the gravity pull of the Black Hole has been crushed all the way along with her soul and was erased completely.</p><br/><p>Second one; the heavy gravity inside the Black Hole created a ripple in space-time and Mantle was thrown to a world that is completely different from our own.</p><br/><p>Third one; because the gravity had been reduced to a minimum, she wasn\u2019t erased nor thrown to a different world, but instead, was caught in the Schwarzschild radius like light and is in eternal movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is the first and second one, we won\u2019t be able to do anything, but if it is the third one, there might still be hope.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I say this while glaring straight at the black sphere I had created.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy scooping out Mantle who might be caught in the circle of the Black Hole, we will bring her back to this world. By doing that, she can strengthen Sasae-chan and it should be possible to have an Earth God Hero.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The possibilities to go against the Demon Lords will increase.</p><br/><p>In order to win the battle, this is a challenge that can\u2019t be avoided.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! And, what should we do to release Mantle?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I honestly answer the question of Shiva.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if Mantle is actually safe in the circle of the Black Hole, I can\u2019t think of a way to bring her back to this world.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>In the past, I said that I don\u2019t have a way to seal a God.</p><br/><p>Without a way to release the seal, would you even be able to call it sealing?</p><ul><li>255: Mother Earth God rescue plan</li></ul><br/><p>And so, we all lost strength and were lying around.</p><br/><p>The desert\u2019s sun was hitting us as if it were hell, but Yorishiro took away the heat in the light and Shiva was dealing with the air conditioning, so even when we were in the middle of the desert, it was decently pleasant.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What do we do?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva was finally unable to endure and lets out a complaint.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that we would be bringing Mantle back, so I came all the way to this desert, and yet, don\u2019t go saying you don\u2019t have a way after we arrived! It was a completely useless trek then!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are noisy! That\u2019s why I said that we will be betting on a 1% chance! I didn\u2019t have the confidence that I would be able to explain it properly unless we were in the place! \u2026Ah, don\u2019t go further from there. You might get swallowed.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>In reality, we are pretty close to the zone to the point that it might be dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought you here thinking that with three Gods a good idea might pop out. You know, three heads are better than one.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell I would know. What kind of sage were you expecting by gathering three Gods?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>True.</p><br/><p>But in order to go against the Demon Lords, I would like the strength of Mother Earth Mantle.</p><br/><p>Even if we fail, there\u2019s no lost in challenging the impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have thought this but\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro didn\u2019t get disheartened and gives out a proposition.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about I try shooting light divine power at my max output once again? If it reaches the dark matter that serves as its core, the Black Hole would be destroyed and it might release Mantle.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we tried that once and it didn\u2019t work\u2026 Right, how about making another Black Hole and make it collide with that other Black Hole?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no no no no no no!!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro surprisingly gets agitated and stops me.</p><br/><p>It is rare for her to get this agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows what would happen when two Black Holes try to erase each other! It might even end up with the world being destroyed before even the Demon Lords do anything!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>It would be the easiest way to destroy the world huh\u2026</p><br/><p>Yeah, let\u2019s not do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in that case, we have no routes to go. Is it really impossible to bring back Mantle from the Black Hole?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>No matter how much we wring our brains out, we can\u2019t find a way to breakthrough.</p><br/><p>As expected of my ultimate technique\u2026no, calling it an ultimate technique would be too lukewarm.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If the rescue of Mantle ends up being impossible, what would happen?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva questions and I had no choice but to answer with exactly what I had in my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo choice but to give up. And then, we will head to Muspelheim to convince Nova.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the remaining Gods, the only one that has a chance to agree is Nova. It is safe to think that Coacervate is out of the question. In this current state where we don\u2019t know when the Demon Lords will be making their move, we should think of time as more important than we normally feel it.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Meaning that we can\u2019t waste a single second.</p><br/><p>We have to make a decision right this instant.</p><br/><p>Will we stop here and make an attempt to revive Mantle, or should we immediately give up and head to where Nova is.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no time to think.</p><br/><p>The time from now on has to be used for action.</p><br/><p>Now then, Mantle or Nova?</p><br/><p>\u201cLight will definitely win against darkness. That is the settled law.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiva?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Shiva suddenly did one step towards the Black Hole.</p><br/><p>Of course, he doesn\u2019t advance any further. If he mistakenly gets too close, he will get pulled by the black sphere\u2019s gravity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why the Black Hole surpasses that law and wins against light is because there\u2019s a gravity barrier before the dark matter and it twists the light divine power\u2026right?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>But what do you plan on doing by confirming that, Shiva?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to call the incarnation of the Light Goddess, Yorishiro, as the strongest light user of the world. If even Yorishiro doing her all cannot break through the gravity barrier of the Black Hole\u2026!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva spreads both of his hands and begins to control his wind divine power.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiva, what are you doing?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was flustered.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because Shiva had his body turned into tatters after the fight with the Demon Lord Raphael and he can\u2019t fight anymore.</p><br/><p>If he forces himself to use divine power, his body might get destroyed from the backlash!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me. It is true that I can\u2019t release my full power anymore, but if I save my strength, I can still utilize a decent amount of divine power. Just like this\u2026\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>A thin glass board was created on top of Shiva\u2019s hand. What is that?</p><br/><p>\u201cBy using the distortion of wind, I created a lens. A lens used to intensify light, that is. If it is divine power control of this level, even my battered body can endure.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cAn air lens! I see. By concentrating all my divine power output onto the lens, it can increase the power even more, right?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>If the strength increases, it could be possible to break through the gravity barrier and reach the core!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will do it as well!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I release dark matter and shape the pitch-black lump into a ring shape.</p><br/><p>By doing that, the view from inside the ring began to distort.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a gravity lens created from dark matter. The intensified light of Yorishiro that has passed through the air lens of Shiva will be amplified even more with this gravity lens. If we increase the concentration and the power goes up\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It might be possible to destroy the Black Hole.</p><br/><p>By doing that, we might be able to release Mantle that\u2019s possibly caught in the ring of the Black Hole!</p><br/><p>\u201cFufufu\u2026this is kind of amusing-desu wa ne.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was confused by Yorishiro who had suddenly begun laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you know, joining strengths like this feels\u2026like we are doing what Karen-san and the others do.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that fine.</p><br/><p>Gods learning from humans.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s learn from Karen-san and the others and cooperate between Gods to destroy the Black Hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s try it! Haine, stand in front of me. Let\u2019s line up the gravity lens and the air lens!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger that.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>We line up right in between Yorishiro and the target. We were basically the barrel that guides the shell to its destination and accelerates it.</p><br/><p>And Yorishiro who has the role of shooting the shell was standing at our back.</p><br/><p>\u201cMantle\u2026we are going this far to save you.

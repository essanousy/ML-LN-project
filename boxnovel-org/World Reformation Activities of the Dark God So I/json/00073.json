What\u2019s this?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cA stone\u2026slab? Gate? Lid?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>At any rate, it is incredibly flat and big. It is no doubt made of stone, but the detailed carvings at the surface were eloquently indicating that this is made by humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think something like this was buried under the sand!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>But we still don\u2019t know what in the world it is.</p><br/><p>This beautifully carved stone slab is big enough that all three of us could easily lie down on it with space to spare, moreover, the part that bothers me the most is that there\u2019s a gap right in the middle of it that runs all the way from bottom to top.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt it can open.</p><br/><p>As I thought, this really is a gate.</p><br/><p>A gate that divides the surface and the underground.</p><br/><p>The problem is how to open it\u2026is what I was thinking when\u2026Yorishiro approaches the gate, places her hand on it, and pours light divine power into it.</p><br/><p>The carvings that were engraved on the surface had light divine power pass freely through them.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026</p><br/><p>*Rumble rumble rumble*, the gate opens on its own.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san and I were so awestruck that we couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>What was after the opened stone gate were stairs. Moreover, stairs leading underground.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, let\u2019s go.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro advances.</p><br/><p>We also hurriedly follow behind her.</p><br/><p>I wonder how far below these stairs lead to.</p><br/><p>We were already underground, and adding that it is night, it was so dark that I couldn\u2019t even see my own hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, make a light.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san gets startled, and from her waist, a clattering sound is made. So she unsheathed her holy sword, Saint-George.</p><br/><p>\u201cPour a bit of light divine power and\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>By doing that, the holy sword lightens up dazzlingly, and the stairs are light up as if it were broad daylight.</p><br/><p>The light divine power is convenient.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Hey, Yorishiro!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I also take out my ethereal flashlight and chase after Yorishiro who continued going down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026haven\u2019t you been weird for a while now?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you ask. After all the events that are occurring, you are not getting fazed at all.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>We removed the sand, found the gate, opened the gate, and continued on; every single one of them was brought by Yorishiro, but there wasn\u2019t a single sign of hesitation as she did those.</p><br/><p>That was as if\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is as if I knew everything from the beginning?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I have said before, don\u2019t read my mind.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might be the case-desu wa. The location of the Underworld country, where to enter, how to open the door; if I knew everything from the beginning, it would be a given that I would know about those things, wouldn\u2019t I?\u2026And what will be happening after as well.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>At some point in time, there were no more stairs.</p><br/><p>And then, the place we arrived at was a big space like that of a hall.</p><br/><p>Moreover, at that place\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>A black shadow is standing right at the center of the hall.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t some sort of metaphor, it really was black, and its outline was so blurred that I could only call it a shadow. It was barely maintaining the shape of a human.</p><br/><p>But it was by no means human.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonster?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san also noticed the abnormality and takes a battle stance.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not right. That\u2019s not a monster.</p><br/><p>Monsters are pseudo-living beings that were created by hardening divine power. You can\u2019t sense the oscillation of the soul inside a hollow existence like them.</p><br/><p>But that shadow\u2026I can certainly feel it.</p><br/><p>It is travelling through the space here and reaching clearly to me\u2026the cadence of a soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I am\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The shadow speaks.</p><br/><p>With only that part alone you can tell that it differs from monsters.</p><br/><p>But the thing that truly surprised me was not there, it is what it said next.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Dark God\u2026Entropy\u2026\u201d</p><ul><li>74: Shadow</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cI am the Dark God\u2026Entropy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The shadow repeats the same thing.</p><br/><p>But, what\u2019s the meaning of this?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way that thing is the Dark God Entropy. The real Dark God Entropy is right here after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDark God\u2026 Is it saying that this one is the Dark God Entropy-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san had also fallen into confusion.</p><br/><p>The objective of this journey\u2026moreover, the target that we shouldn\u2019t have been able to find\u2026has appeared right in front of our eyes after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026have never seen a God with my own eyes though. But it is certainly not a human, and now that I look carefully, it is different from a monster as well. Then, is it really a God?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>No, it isn\u2019t. Karen-san\u2019s judgement is wrong.</p><br/><p>It is true that this isn\u2019t a human or a monster. But even so, it is rash to call it a God.</p><br/><p>Specially the Dark God Entropy, there\u2019s no way.</p><br/><p>The reincarnation of the Dark God is right here after all.</p><br/><p>As long as I am the Dark God, there\u2019s no way that this one is the real one.</p><br/><p>Then, what is this thing that\u2019s calling itself with my name?</p><br/><p>At the very least, it knows the name Entropy. With only that, it turns into a hard to ignore mystery.</p><br/><p>I am supposed to be a hidden God that was sealed 1,600 years ago and no one knows of.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karen-san and I were confused, but when I take a sidelong glance at Yorishiro, I could see that only she was calm.</p><br/><p>What should we do in this situation?</p><br/><p>Unable to read the situation, we couldn\u2019t make a careless move.</p><br/><p>The one who moved the situation was that\u2026the dark shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am\u2026the Dark God\u2026Entropy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The figure, that was barely maintaining the human silhouette, crumbled, and moves quickly in a form like that of a thick line.</p><br/><p>And the place that it was moving to was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san! Watch out!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right before it was about to hit her, the holy sword repels the lunging shadow.</p><br/><p>Good, she properly guarded from that. But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, it really is an enemy!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what it must mean if that thing attacked us.</p><br/><p>It still is an existence that\u2019s filled of enigma, but there\u2019s no choice but to fight back.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Dark Matter, Set]!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Several thousands, several millions of jet black particles spring forth from both of my arms, become a mass, and create a black swirl.</p><br/><p>This is a brutal swirl formed of dark matter that erases earth, water, fire, and wind the moment it makes contact with them.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it also possesses a second property that is gravity control. Even against things that are not composed of divine power, it still possesses strong suppression power.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I release the black swirl towards the black shadow.</p><br/><p>Now, what will you do? Even if it\u2019s a lie, you are calling yourself the Dark God. Show me how you are going to deal with the dark matter!</p><br/><p>But the shadow didn\u2019t confront the dark matter directly, it turned long and narrow and jumped away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, escaping?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Moreover, those movements are a lot more agile than I expected.</p><br/><p>If it leaves the range of the light that Karen-san\u2019s holy sword is creating, the human eye is unable to keep up with its speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will assist you, Haine-san! I will add a bit more light divine power, and\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san increases the amount of light divine power she is pouring in the holy sword.</p><br/><p>When she does that, the blade releases even more light, and lights up an even larger sphere.</p><br/><p>Okay, with this, even if the shadow escapes far away, we will still be able to see it without losing sight of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t! Karen-san!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a strained scream resounds. The one who let out that voice was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yorishiro, who has been acting calm all this time as if she knew everything, was suddenly agitated.</p><br/><p>But I didn\u2019t have the time to think about this.</p><br/><p>That shadow had turned into a line as it springs around, and attacks Karen-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cEi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karen-san once again deflects it with her holy sword and avoids a direct hit.</p><br/><p>But, why did the shadow suddenly change its target to Karen-san?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this all of a sudden?! \u2026\u2026\u2026But as a hero, I just have to shake off the sparks that come flying.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, please leave this to me, you protect Yorishiro-sama! In this narrow underground, I can\u2019t utilize the wide-ranged \u2018Holy Light Sword\u2019. In that case, I will concentrate the light divine power into one spot and\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>She adjusts the aim with the tip of her holy sword, and\u2026shoots.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Holy Light Line]!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The blade of the holy sword turns into light and stretches.</p><br/><p>Accurately speaking, it is a line shaped divine power that was shot out from the holy sword, and it looked as if the blade itself had stretched.</p><br/><p>That light thorn pierces through the shadow that was moving around at high speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYay! I hit it!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>To think she would be able to hit it in one go against a target that was making such crazy movements, as expected of a hero.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t! This is not good!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro screams once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not that the attack hit the target, that child went itself to be hit! You can\u2019t give light divine power to that child!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>By the time we noticed something was wrong, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>After receiving a direct hit from the attack of Karen-san, we thought that it would get injured and weaken, but those expectations were betrayed.</p><br/><p>It was the complete contrary.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am\u2026the Dark God\u2026Entropy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shadow\u2026consumed Karen-san\u2019s attack and became bigger!</p><ul><li>75: Underground Battle</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026is this?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san who was the very person that attacked was surprised by the unexpected situation.</p><br/><p>This attack that she released intending to damage or kill it, actually made it even livelier. Of course she would be surprised.</p><br/><p>Is it correct to call it livelier?</p><br/><p>At any rate, that shadow devoured the light divine power of Karen-san and was rapidly growing bigger.</p><br/><p>It is already three times bigger than before.</p><br/><p>It may be my imagination but, it looks like that jet black color covering its body had grown even thicker as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san! Stop your attack! It will become bigger and bigger!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! Okay!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>With all that surprise, Karen-san had forgotten to stop her \u2018Holy Light Line\u2019, but after being shouted by me, she stops pouring divine power.</p><br/><p>But by the time she did that, the shadow had already grown big enough to look down on us.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt ate the light divine power\u2026 is how I should take this sight as, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I infer this from the occurrence in front of me.</p><br/><p>With the light divine power attack that Karen-san released as the trigger, it grew in such a splendid manner, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other reason\u2026</p><br/><p>But, is that even possible?</p><br/><p>\u201cLight\u2026making the darkness bigger? That normally would never happen.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI-Is that so?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Preparing ourselves for the attack of the shadow that would be resuming, we gather at one location.</p><br/><p>Karen-san probably thinks that her mistake worsened the situation, she looks like she is sorry. I answer that question of hers with the intention of lessening that feeling of hers as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dark element\u2026the dark matter is a substance that can erase any element unconditionally. Earth, water, fire, wind; in the face of the Dark element, they are all powerless. But, there\u2019s an exception.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe light divine power.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro takes over and speaks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san looks like he is invincible at a glance, but the only weakness of the dark matter is the light divine power. The only element that the dark matter can\u2019t erase is light, and on the contrary, the darkness is the one that gets erased.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro sends me a gaze, and I understood what she was trying to say. I let out a small amount of dark matter.</p><br/><p>When Yorishiro hits this dark matter with her own light divine power, the dark swirl scatters and disappears like bubbles. There was not a single sign of resistance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Karen-san was honestly surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four base elements have a rotation of weak points within their own group. Darkness is the natural enemy of all of them, and Darkness can\u2019t win against Light. Moreover, Light is slightly stronger than all the four base elements which is an unreliable advantage.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, it creates a bigger cycle of affinities.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Since I have not been fighting against light, I had completely forgotten about it.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s the \u2018Holy Light Bullet\u2019 of Captain Vesage that\u2019s on the level of a small grain, I can still manage, but when it comes to a certain level of skill, darkness absolutely can\u2019t defeat light.</p><br/><p>This is the biggest reason as to why I lost in the battle of Gods 1,600 years ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s exactly the reason why that shadow is abnormal.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The shadow was courteously waiting as we were in the middle of explaining.</p><br/><p>It looks like it is adapting to its sudden gigantification and it is taking its time to do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am\u2026the Dark God\u2026Entropy.\u201d</p><br/><p>While at it, it repeated the same thing.</p><br/><p>Does it like introducing itself that much?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe light divine power is supposed to be a deadly poison, and yet, it instead got bigger. It is the very definition of an existence outside of common sense! Ah, but, if that shadow is truly a God, common sense wouldn\u2019t apply in the first pl\u2014\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I am the actual Dark God, and yet, common sense still applies to me.</p><br/><p>In the first place, that guy is not a God. Probably.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, as long as light doesn\u2019t work on it, Karen-san, please step back.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>And then, I step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the same element, the one with the stronger power wins. This is the natural rule. I wonder if it will see my dark matter as delicious food as well. Let\u2019s have it relish plenty.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Dark Matter, Set.</p><br/><p>With a fist clad with dark matter, I try hitting the giant shadow but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt ran away again!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Does that thing not have any intentions of fighting me?</p><br/><p>Even when it has become bigger, it is still agile. While evading my attacks, it circumvents me and yet, not even giving me an eye, it rushes forward.</p><br/><p>Its destination was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san! Yorishiro!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>That bastard, just how much does it aim for women?!</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not it. Its objective is the light divine power that Karen-san and Yorishiro release.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, that thing has been aiming for Karen-san persistently from the very beginning.

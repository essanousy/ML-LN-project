I made it so it wouldn\u2019t be possible to find it in normal circumstances, but I am an exception. They can\u2019t hide anything from me.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Well, you are the very God that created them after all.</p><br/><p>We continue talking about this situation that would normally be quite troublesome without the God himself guiding.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026But what should we do about the girls there? Bringing them with us is a bit\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can just make a random reason to move on our own. I am the Wind Founder, you know. I am in a position that can order people around.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true, but after rampaging as much as you wanted, it is a bit hard to swallow that you are actually a Founder, you know.</p><br/><p>But even so, we will be going there to cut off the last line that Beelzebub left, the obvious questions that Karen-san and company would ask would be \u2018What is that egg?\u2019 \u2018How did you find it?\u2019 which are the obvious questions that will come, and trying to answer them would be a pain.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Haine-san, Haine-san.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is Haine.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Is what I was thinking when Karen-san spoke to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Uhm, what is that egg?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>From the mouth of Karen-san, the question that would be incredibly troublesome if asked had come out.</p><br/><p>Why now?</p><br/><p>I thought that she would ask of this when we have moved to a different place though?</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I turn at the strangeness of that question, and there really was an egg.</p><br/><p>It was floating in the air.</p><br/><p>I could tell at one glance that it was giving vibes different from that of a chicken egg. It had a more soft membrane-looking shell; an insect egg.</p><br/><p>And as if it had telekinetic powers, it was floating in the air.</p><br/><p>Its surface was completely green, like that of an emerald, and a transparency that felt as if it was breed underwater.</p><br/><p>And so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOi\u2026could it be that\u2019s the Green Emperor Egg?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah! But why is it at a place like this?! In order for the Green Emperor Egg to not be caught in the eye of anyone, I hid it at the shadows of the base of Rudras Metropolis. The size as well! It is an egg to give birth to Beelzebub, you know? It should be as big as the tip of the pinky finger!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>But we were able to notice the egg that is floating right now in front of our very eyes immediately, and I can even feel an ominousness that is overwhelming.</p><br/><p>This size is enough to hold a whole human inside.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Kuromiya Haine! Attack the Green Emperor Egg!! If it\u2019s your dark matter, you should be able to return anything to nothingness!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy me?! You can do it. You know everything about that thing, right?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I have judged that the best way is to use your dark matter! Or more like, I also don\u2019t understand this situation! Like hell I would be able to finish off that disgusting thing with my own hands!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard spilled out his real feelings!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>In the time Shiva and I were making a ruckus, the situation progressed.</p><br/><p>Probably to the worst path.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>That voice send shivers down the spine of Shiva, Karen-san, Hyue, and I.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat voice just now\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the voice of anyone here, right? Then, just now was\u2014!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>From that egg?</p><br/><p>\u201cRight back at you! Just what are you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if by reflex, someone asked back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 who am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>The egg asks once more.</p><br/><p>But that question was not directed at anyone; it was a question directed at itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 so mother died. That\u2019s why I will be born. I will move towards the fate that has been established for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The egg that was covered in a dark green membrane began to flicker.</p><br/><p>Something was about to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been thinking for a long time. Why were we born?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor all living beings, there should be a reason for their birth. There should be meaning in their life. I was thinking of that reason. As I thought of this, several thousands to millions of my brethrens died. There was no point in us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The flickering sensation of the egg steadily became stronger.</p><br/><p>The light itself increased in potency.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were born pointlessly, and died pointlessly. I began to wonder, \u2018aren\u2019t we pointless from the very beginning?\u2019. No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if displaying the emotions of the owner of that voice, the light became stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2026Emotions?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are also alive. We are alive, so we have to do something. I have been thinking. I have been thinking all this time. As I continued my thinking, mother gave birth to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cracking noise resounded.</p><br/><p>The sound of something breaking.</p><br/><p>At the same time as that happened, a single tear ran through the giant green egg.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to find the answer, just thinking about it won\u2019t make the answer appear. I must take action. In order to take action, I need a body. A body that is the strongest and the mightiest. That is me. I who was given birth by my demonic mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the crack that ran at the middle of the egg, something was coming out from it.</p><br/><p>Wings?</p><br/><p>Butterfly wings?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI was born for the sake of leading all of the demonic beings. I was born from a demonic mother in order to give meaning to the demonic beings that had pointless flesh and received pointless deaths. My demonic mother poured all of her life into me, and gave birth to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark green eggshell broke in several small pieces, and what was inside was revealed.</p><br/><p>It was a child.</p><br/><p>A child that was small in height.</p><br/><p>He looked like a child that had nothing strange at all, but there was a single thing that was abnormal. From his back, he had butterfly wings of erratic design.</p><br/><p>And then, the child speaks.</p><br/><p>He continues the words he had been speaking of until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter a hundred years, we demons have obtained the ability to think, and seek for meaning. I am the means for that end, the means for that step. In order to lead my brethrens that still hold no soul to what lies further beyond, I have been born to become their Lord. In other words, I am\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He is\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Wind Demon Lord, Raphael. That is my name, my meaning, and what I have to do.\u201d (Raphael)</p><ul><li>166: Birth of a Demon</li></ul><br/><p>Wind Demon Lord, Raphael.</p><br/><p>This mysterious child that suddenly appeared certainly did introduce himself as so.</p><br/><p>His look is indeed small and frail, a child with a pure face you could find anywhere, but the butterfly wings that spread from his back were abnormal. Moreover, he came out from the egg that was called Green Emperor Egg.</p><br/><p>Originally, that egg should have given birth once again to the Wind Mother Monster, Beelzebub, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you\u2026a monster?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>The one who asked this of the child the fastest was Shiva.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Monster. That is how the humans call us. I -Raphael- if asked if I am a monster or not, I only have one answer\u2026 that\u2019s right.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>At that answer, everyone here had their skin shiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the one who was born to become the leader of the wind element monsters, Demon Lord Raphael.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva shouts as if in madness.</p><br/><p>\u201cA monster has taken the form of a human and can speak?! There\u2019s no way a monster with such intelligence exists! I have not ma\u2014!!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Saying until that part, Shiva\u2019s mouth shuts.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s Karen-san and Hyue close by. He must have felt that he needed to be careful with his words as the Wind God Quasar.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Foolish human. All things face vicissitudes. They don\u2019t stay at one state of being. From that change, they will look at higher heights, and walk the path of evolution. Don\u2019t think that is a privilege of only you humans. That\u2019s nothing but arrogance.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord that calls himself Raphael says this as if spitting those words out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe monsters also evolve and walk forward. And the result is as you see before your eyes. The Demon Lord Raphael. My mother, Beelzebub, lived for close to a hundred years, and after experiencing several thousands to millions to billions of experiences, she obtained the ability to think, she obtained sentience. And so, she began to question what we were, and for what reason we exist.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026did you say?!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>From the looks of Shiva\u2019s shock, I can tell that not even the God himself was expecting this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, the Mother Monster had reached a temporary conclusion: \u2018I can\u2019t reach the answer myself\u2019. That\u2019s why mother gave birth to me. The next generation in order to obtain the answer. The parents ask, and the child answers. That is the basis of evolution for living beings. Therefore, I will be the bearer of a new era for us monsters. I will fulfill that duty.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you planning on doing?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>This time, I ask Raphael.</p><br/><p>It was so sudden, moreover, a situation that was so unexpected, my thoughts had still not caught on yet. Even so, I have no choice but to understand it. I have to know what it is that will be occurring from now on.</p><br/><p>By the way, Karen-san and Hyue were completely unable to follow and were staring blankly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will become the one who guides monsters, you will create a new era for the monsters; I understand that. But what is it you are going to do exactly in order to reach that objective of yours? Do you have a plan?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord Raphael says.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe exterminate you humans.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>A shock ran through my body.</p><br/><p>From the mysterious and unknown existence, hostility was directed at us for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, we monsters have been given that duty by some unknown being. \u2018Oppose humans\u2019, \u2018Attack humans\u2019. I don\u2019t know from who this order is, but since the moment we were born, it has been edged deep down in our self. We act with that as our base of action.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2014!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva wanted to say something, but Raphael ignored it and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this surface world, there\u2019s no need for two supreme rulers. That\u2019s why, we will carry out the duty that is edged deeply inside our self for our own sake. We will eradicate the humans, and when the world has become ours completely, the meaning of our existence should be visible.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>The butterfly wings at the back of Raphael spread.</p><br/><p>And then, they flap.</p><br/><p>With just that simple action, four tornadoes were created from all four sides of Raphael.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvade it, it is dangerous!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaa!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>We were flustered by the rampaging tornadoes, but their target wasn\u2019t us. The tornadoes move as they undulated, and scatter to their respective directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo begin with, let\u2019s destroy the city that is at my feet. Without leaving a single one alive, without leaving a single piece of rubble behind. Turning everything related to humans to ashes, we will use that as the foundation stone for the new era of us monsters!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cRudras Metropolis is\u2014!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>This is bad.</p><br/><p>All the tornadoes that Raphael released are calamity class. What it swallows, whether it is human or a building, it will mow it down.</p><br/><p>Is it exactly because he was born from the Wind Mother Mother, and he himself is calling himself the Wind Demon Lord that he is able to show power in such shape?</p><br/><p>But even so, being able to create four tornadoes of such power is abnormal.</p><br/><p>Managing such feat in one flutter is not possible for humans or monsters.</p><br/><p>His power\u2026is already stepping into the realm of Gods?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva kicks the ground, and faces Raphael who is suspended in mid-air with his big wings.</p><br/><p>Unsheathing his Wind Twin Guns, Fuuma Koutarou, he fired air bullets, but they were stopped by an invisible wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cA wall of air?! Don\u2019t underestimate me!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Being hit multiple times by the wind twin guns, the wall of air was destroyed, and Shiva closed onto Raphael.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it! Stop it right now!! The ones who ordered you monsters to attack humans were the Gods! But the Gods didn\u2019t wish for humans to be eradicated! What you are trying to do is a deviation of duty!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cGods\u2026 The ones you humans call the five Gods of Creation? Idiotic. What about it?\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Raphael\u2019s attitude was cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter who was the one who ordered us, we were the ones who decided on destroying the humans. It was our will. Deciding on your own actions is a natural privilege of living beings. Even if your Gods are our creators as well, they can\u2019t violate our privilege!!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cGuwaaa?!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>The squall that Raphael caused blew away Shiva.</p><br/><p>Right before Shiva hit the floor, I caught him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Now that it has come to this, there\u2019s no choice but for me to defeat that guy.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord, Raphael.</p><br/><p>He is a clear threat to humans. If we don\u2019t defeat him here, the harm he will create will spread far!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Haine!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva must have felt my killing intent, he stopped me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will defeat him. As the one responsible for creating him, I will!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Shiva created the wind element monsters as the Wind God Quasar, and it is true that as a result, the Demon Lord Raphael has been born.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, it is not as if I don\u2019t understand how you feel. But even so, right now you have incarnated as a human, and are in complete tatters because of our fight today.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way you would have the remaining strength to oppose Raphael who is close to being comparable to a God!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe tornadoes are\u2026! Beginning to spread!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Just as Shiva said, the four tornadoes that Raphael released have already destroyed the buildings of the Wind Church, and they are about to step into the urban area of Rudras Metropolis.</p><br/><p>Those things that have been created from the divine power of the Demon Lord will surely destroy Rudras Metropolis without losing any strength as it moves.</p><br/><p>Not only the buildings of the city, there are also many lives there.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only one who can stop those tornadoes is you who controls dark matter. I will take care of things here. That\u2019s why, I leave my people\u2026in your care!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiva!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>I try to keep my expression from crumbling as I jump away.</p><br/><p>First, from the closest tornado.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s a natural disaster that is comparable to that of the wrath of a God, in front of me, they are not a problem at all.</p><br/><p>I will deal with this as soon as possible and return.</p><br/><p>I leave things to you until I return, Guardian of the wind people!!</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-163-164-an-attack-to-end-it-all\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 163-164 - An attack to end it all\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-167-169-unyielding\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 167-169 - Unyielding\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236313\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

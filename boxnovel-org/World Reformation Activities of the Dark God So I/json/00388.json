Haine-san has?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I -Kourin Karen- was doubting the report that was told to me.</p><br/><p>Haine-san was swallowed by the Black Hole he himself created?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that true? Is it true that Haine-san has disappeared, Yorishiro-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSadly, it is the truth.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The one who revealed this to me was our Founder, Yorishiro-sama.</p><br/><p>In the time we were in an hectic state with helping Rudras Metropolis after the damage they received, and with the preparations of the Light capital\u2019s defense, she was apparently using light divine power to confirm the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Light Demon Lord Lucifer that Ates-san\u2014no, the Goddess Inflation created was a worse monster than we ever imagined.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>From what Yorishiro said, Lucifer absorbed the Demon Lords and is now able to use all four base elements.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the power of the Wind Demon Lord that died, Lucifer utilized the advantage of affinities to defeat one Demon Lord after another, and stole away their powers. Right now Lucifer not only has light, but can also freely control all base elements.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cA single monster\u2026controlling all elements?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that invincible? The guy itself doesn\u2019t have a weak point, and yet, it can hit its opponent\u2019s weaknesses as much as it wants, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones who groaned in such way were Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>Not only them.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also Sasae-chan and Hyue-chan here.</p><br/><p>They heard about the emergency Apollon City was in and had all come to help.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this time when we finally managed to have Uriel-dono promise to become the new deity-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cDid things end up like this because I defeated Raphael?!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Right now, Sasae-chan has already separated from Mother Earth and has returned to her little girl form.</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan has also recovered from the wounds she suffered in the battle with Raphael, but her regrets are heavy.</p><br/><p>We five heroes have reunited after a good while, and yet, the atmosphere was heavier than ever before.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026But no matter how strong the enemy was, that Haine was able to defeat them without any problem!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Isn\u2019t Haine-chi the kind of guy that had crazy power making you go \u2018seriously?\u2019 or \u2018no way\u2019?! Even the Demon Lords were scared of his dark power and made them run away and hide. If it were Haine-chi, he would be able to go against all elements!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan\u2019s protests were simply futile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt may be Haine-san, but it is not as if he is completely invincible. The darkness power that\u2019s supposed to erase everything has one opponent it doesn\u2019t work on.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c?!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the light element. Darkness cannot defeat light.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>This was a reality that all heroes aside from me didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Only earth, water, fire, and wind element monsters existed until now, and there was no light element monster.</p><br/><p>On top of that, the first ones that Haine-san affiliated to after coming to society were us, the Light Church.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why there were no moments where Haine-san had to fight light, so the weakness of the darkness didn\u2019t get exposed until now.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it looked like it was invincible.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now, the ultimate light has appeared in the form of Lucifer. For Haine-san, the Light Demon Lord is truly his natural enemy. There\u2019s truly limited methods he can take against that.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Do you mean the Black Hole?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The ultimate darkness attack that erased Grandma Wood in Ishtar Blaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy utilizing the second property of the dark matter to its very limit, the gravity that occurs from it can even bend light. That heavy gravity cannot be broken through by light and would be erased by the compressed dark matter that serves as the core of the Black Hole.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t Haine-chi like seriously invincible?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The retort of Celestis-chan was also ineffective right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in order to erase Lucifer, there would be the need for a Black Hole that\u2019s several times more powerful than the time with Grandma Wood. If he were to release something like that, this world itself wouldn\u2019t get away safely.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t get away safely?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, it would be enough to destroy humanity.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Humanity will perish with the aftereffects?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Black Hole is originally a technique to destroy the world. In order to avoid that, Haine-san released a Black Hole at its minimum force.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>And that is the current situation.</p><br/><p>We are currently in the meeting room of the Light Church\u2019s headquarters. At that table, several photos were thrown on top of it.</p><br/><p>It is from the scouting unit of the Aurora Knights that had taken photos of the battle between Haine-san\u2019s group and Lucifer.</p><br/><p>There was a black sphere floating and it was a sight as if out of this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe ourselves have seen the Black Hole in Ishtar Blaze as well, but\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is strange\u2026!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just a simple Black Hole.</p><br/><p>From the sphere that\u2019s supposed to swallow everything, the tail of a snake was jutting out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the tail of Lucifer.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama began to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cLucifer is basically a giant snake monster. A small Black Hole on a level that can\u2019t injure the world wouldn\u2019t be able to swallow the whole body and its tail has ended up poking out.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>It resembled the situation of when a wild snake has swallowed a mouse from the head and wasn\u2019t able to swallow it whole and its tail is peeping out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a Black Hole only on this level after all. It would be no surprise if Lucifer were to slip out in due time. Even without that, we are talking about the Demon Lord that holds the light that has the absolute advantage against darkness. With enough time, it could even destroy the Black Hole itself.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cTime\u2026 How long would it be?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take a month. At worst, a few days.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Only a few days?!</p><br/><p>The method that Haine-san gave his very body to utilize will return to nothing in just a few days?!</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>As if seeing through my heart, Yorishiro-sama reprimands me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san accepted to be swallowed by the Black Hole himself in order to obtain those few days. Believing that you guys would definitely overcome this crisis.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><ul><li>389: By the hands of humans</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2026?\u201d \u201cOvercome\u2026?\u201d \u201cThis crisis\u2026?\u201d \u201c-Dasu?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other heroes aside from me were also confused at the words of Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan, Celestis-chan, Sasae-chan, Hyue-chan, and I -Karen.</p><br/><p>We obtained the title of hero, and we are people that have obtained the qualifications and awareness that we should protect others, but just in this one, my heart is simply not standing up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you say that\u2026is that an opponent we can do something about?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The first one to voice out her doubts was the most intellectual one in the group, Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn opponent that not even that Haine-chi could go against\u2026 No, not only Haine-chi, even the Demon Lords were unable to do anything against Lucifer and lost, right?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>In the past when we met the Demon Lords, we were wondering how to defeat such a big opponent like them and despair had filled us.</p><br/><p>After that, with the miracle called God Hero, we somehow managed to overcome the battle against the Demon Lords, but\u2026a threat that easily surpasses those Demon Lords arrived, Lucifer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsorbing the Demon Lords means that, at the very least, it has the power of four Demon Lords at once, on top of that, it also has the Light element that stands atop of those. That\u2019s the Great Demon Lord Lucifer, right?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The voice of Mirack-chan was also weaker than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we were to turn into God Heroes and face them, it would deftly hit our weaknesses and make us crumble in an instant. An enemy that holds all elements is just\u2026!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething we haven\u2019t fought before-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Everyone was dejected.</p><br/><p>The reason is obvious.</p><br/><p>Haine-san fought and couldn\u2019t defeat it.</p><br/><p>That reality was shocking us more than expected.</p><br/><p>Haine-san is incredibly strong.</p><br/><p>Using a special power that is darkness, he has managed to defeat all enemies easily.</p><br/><p>Even though he has that much strength, he didn\u2019t step in more than necessary in consideration of us heroes, but we all felt peace of mind somewhere in our heart knowing that he had our backs.</p><br/><p>\u2014No matter how dangerous it gets, Haine-san will do something about it in the end.</p><br/><p>I thought something like that unconsciously.</p><br/><p>And yet, that Haine-san used his all just to seal an opponent together with him for a few days.</p><br/><p>That is the Great Demon Lord Lucifer.</p><br/><p>The reality that we have to fight an opponent like that was agitating us.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all acting like spoiled children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden strict words made me reflexively quiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yorishiro-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>To think she would reprimand us in such a direct way\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, what are you?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Even if you ask me to answer\u2026</p><br/><p>What am I? Even if you suddenly ask me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Uhm\u2026!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026The l-light hero.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>Chosen by the Light Church, shouldering the power of the Light Goddess Inflation, and protecting the people; that light hero!!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you, Mirack-san?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only me.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama made the same question to every one of us here.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to ask. I am the fire hero chosen by the Fire Church!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-san?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, the water hero. Isn\u2019t that obvious!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chan?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIncompetent Sasae! The earth hero-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter fighting with Raphael, I can finally say it with pride. I, Hyue, am the wind hero-de gozaru!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>We all are the heroes chosen by their respective churches.</p><br/><p>Our responsibility is not only to protect the people, but to also stand proud and be an image to others. In order to provide them strength, and at the same time, strengthen humanity itself as a whole.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you of all people afraid of the enemy? Fighting the enemy that threatens the people and defeating them is the duty of heroes, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why Haine-san was sealed together with Lucifer was because he believed that you all could do something as long as there\u2019s time. Until now, many threats have attacked you all!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The Fire Cow Phalaris in the Radona mountain range; the Hydra Serpent in Hydra Ville; Grandma Wood\u2019s rebellion in the earth capital; the sequential battles against Beelzebub and the Wind Demon Lord Raphael; the heroes match; and then the clash against the Demon Lords\u2026</p><br/><p>Just remembering them all makes me feel as if I am losing weight at how many things have happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you have overcome all of them. Was the reason why you overcame them all solely thanks to Haine-san?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are all strong. And you also have a strong sense of duty that turns into your own strength when facing danger. That strength of heart, Haine-san believes in it. This is the time for you all to answer that trust once again!!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>?!</p><br/><p>Right, Haine-san has always trusted us.</p><br/><p>He believed that we would all definitely overcome those difficulties.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering that trust is what a hero does, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>It is not only Haine-san, all the people in this world, no matter the threat, they believe that the heroes will be able to defeat it.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what a hero is.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like we weren\u2019t acting like ourselves.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, this is the chance to make Haine-chi owe us. Let\u2019s save him as a change!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-dono be the saviour of Ishtar Blaze-dasu! Imma also save Uriel-dono and have a festival-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like this is the time to show the true form of the wind hero, Hyue!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Everyone regained their energy.</p><br/><p>Everyone here is used to crisis, so a good push on the back was plenty enough to make us stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Yorishiro-sama! You are telling us to use the best of the time Haine-san bought for us to face Lucifer, right?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will also properly save the Demon Lords! I still have a lot of lectures piled up to teach Gabriel about culture after all!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The mood was completely turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What we have to think about is in what to use that time. Training? Should we research for combinations we can use when we turn into God Heroes?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will also have to investigate the enemy plenty-de gozaru. With the scientific power of our Wind Church, we will research Lucifer thoroughly. We might find a new weakness.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cCut-dasu! We gonna cut it completely-dasu yo!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Vigorous opinions fly around.</p><br/><p>But the one who stopped that flow was Yorishiro-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No, I want you all to use this time to go somewhere.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>She wants us to go somewhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you go there, you will definitely find a plan against Lucifer. I will have you five heroes head there immediately.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cA-And that place is\u2026?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really okay?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Is what I ask nervously, but Yorishiro-sama said the name of the place I didn\u2019t even expect would come out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Underworld Country.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-385-387-proof-of-existence\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 385-387 - Proof of existence\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-390-391-five-colored-gloss-fountain\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 390-391 - Five Colored Gloss Fountain\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236402\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Ah~, that surprised me. Did you check on Hyue already? I want to hear the details about it, but sadly to say, I still can\u2019t get my hands off this, you see.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201c[Dark Matter, Set]\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Uwaaa?!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>I engulf Shiva in dark matter no questions asked and, just like that, leave the room carrying him on my shoulders.</p><br/><p>Kidnapping the Founder?, I don\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>I have the permission of the wind hero, so there\u2019s no problem.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>And in this way, I return shouldering my catch, and there, I could see Hyue returning with the ghost Juo under her arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>We were having an exchange with the minimum amount of words.</p><br/><p>Quick information transmission is an important part in succeeding at a crime.</p><br/><p>And so, like this, we gathered the bride and groom.</p><br/><p>We made them do a seiza side by side.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026Hyue? Just what in the world is going on?!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva was unable to understand what was happening at all and the fact that he was suddenly kidnapped.</p><br/><p>You would obviously want to hear the reason in all the confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way you don\u2019t know, Aniue-sama. I have already heard everything from Fein-san.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven when you are in face of your wedding that only happens once in your whole life, you have been too focused in your job that you haven\u2019t done the preparations. Aniue-sama\u2019s wedding not only involves both of your families, but also the whole Wind nation, and on top of that, it also gathers the attention of the other Churches.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Truly the epitome of workaholic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were to show an unsightly wedding because of a lack of preparations, the embarrassment of the Wind Church could be transmitted to the whole world! I will have Aniue-sama and the others concentrate on the wedding preparations! All other jobs will be temporarily put on hold!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But, if we were to do that, the management of the Wind Church would stagnate\u2014!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust leave it to administration. If they can\u2019t progress with anything without inquiring with the Founder, they are of no need!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but\u2026it was because of my long absence that work that only the Founder can put a final word to has been accumulated heavily\u2026!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have been able to manage until today, you can manage to accumulate it for 10 days more. At any rate, please quickly decide the priest for the ceremony!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Uwa\u2026</p><br/><p>Hyue is going full-throttle, no questions asked.</p><br/><p>I thought she was a straight-laced and moderate girl, but to think she had such a strong pushy side to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue-ojousama has been like that since long ago.\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>Fein-san, who is standing by my side, says this.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is polite and proper when in public, but with her relatives\u2026especially Shiva-obocchama and Juo-sama, she is\u2026how to say it, incredibly strong!\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven towards Juo?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Meaning she sees Juo as a relative?</p><br/><p>Or more like, she sounds like the total opposite of our Doraha.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I am serving the Toreido family from my father\u2019s side, so I know of Obocchama since they were children. Hyue-ojousama, who is normally obedient like a doll, would turn into a beast only at the times when Juo-sama came to play!\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that was because she hated me\u2026!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cHiiih?!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Juo suddenly appeared from nowhere, and Fein and I were about to have our heart stopped.</p><br/><p>Looks like her ghost-looks aren\u2019t something that you get used to no matter how long you know that person for, as proved by Fein-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been bitten by her in the times she was not even a year old. I thought that she simply couldn\u2019t stand me in a physiological level\u2026!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s not the case, Juo-sama! Hyue-ojousama likes Juo-sama quite a lot!\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Maid-san, I understand you wanting to smooth the relationship of your employer\u2019s family, but I think you shouldn\u2019t say those kind of things so lightly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. When Juo-sama was a child, every time you came to play to our residence, Shiva-obocchama would always meet you together with her, didn\u2019t she?!\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than calling it meeting me, it was more like she was waiting to hit me\u2026!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>I can imagine a little Hyue going \u2018grrr\u2019 as she shouts \u2018don\u2019t touch Aniue-sama!!\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven when Juo-sama walked the path of a scientist and entered the academy, Hyue-ojousama had Juo-sama in her mind. She held you in her mind as much as Shiva-obocchama who had entered training for the Kazama Shinobis.\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is more of a \u2018know thy enemy\u2019\u2026!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>The one who controls information controls the war after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I have tried asking about this to Hyue-ojousama once. About what she thinks of Juo-sama.\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou overstepped your boundaries there, Maid-san.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>This has already pushed me to blurt my thoughts out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I brought that topic up in between casual talk though. Until that time, I honestly thought that Hyue-sama didn\u2019t like the lady of the Brastor household.\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>But Hyue apparently answered in this way.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said: \u2018It is the person that Aniue-sama likes a lot, so it can\u2019t be helped\u2019.\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>Fein-san plays out with a change of tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like rather than her own feelings, she had accepted the feelings that Shiva-obocchama had towards Juo-sama and couldn\u2019t do anything about. She treasures her brother more than anything else after all. She understands that the help of Juo-sama is necessary for the sake of Shiva-obocchama\u2019s happiness.\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no bigger happiness as a maid than being able to serve these siblings.\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how Fein-san wrapped this up.</p><br/><p>This might be the silver tongue of a maid that is trying to avoid problems within the family, but it also felt like there was a tint of truth in it.</p><br/><p>That must be how the heart of a human works.</p><br/><p>\u201cFein-san! Fein-san!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>And Hyue was currently unstoppable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe personal selection of the priest, the interior design of the banquet, the seating order of the attendees; all of those have been decided! What\u2019s left is for the staff to do their best!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Already?!</p><br/><p>Hyue-san sure works fast!</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much!! With this, we will make it to the estimated day!!\u201d (Fein)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat hasn\u2019t been decided yet is the bride\u2019s dress!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue\u2019s gaze falls onto Juo.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Juo! This point alone can\u2019t be left to the groom! You have to choose for yourself the dress that you will be displaying!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Hyue.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cNice, sister-in-law.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cStop with the nonsensical talk and hurry. I heard that the bride\u2019s dress is still only sewn in its initial stages!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue pulls the hand of Juo-san.</p><br/><p>This is the first time I see her going in such an energetic manner. I can already see the difference in treatment she has towards family.</p><ul><li>353: Purification equipment</li></ul><br/><p>Hyue pulls Juo-san away.</p><br/><p>We can\u2019t just leave those girls alone, so Karen-san, Doraha, and I go together with them.</p><br/><p>The place we arrived at was a luxurious clothing room.</p><br/><p>There were several tens of clothing that were worn by mannequins or hung and lined up, moreover, they were all female clothes. On top of that, from what I see, each one of them looks so fancy that I think it would cost a whole month of my pay for a single one.</p><br/><p>They truly are <i>the</i> dresses.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are all the candidates for the wedding dress of Juo.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of them?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t there way too many?</p><br/><p>There might actually be close to a hundred dresses here!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying we have to choose only one from all of this?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Haine-san? In the weddings of these days, it is common sense to change dresses.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cChange dresses?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san\u2019s was looking at me with eyes as if saying \u2018does he not know?\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou change several times in the middle of the ceremony. And so, you dress in several different types of wedding dresses.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, and in that way, it entertains the eyes of the guests.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obviously because the bride wants to dress in a variety of dresses?! A wedding ceremony is something you only get once in a lifetime!! That\u2019s why, it is impossible to just go in one dress!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Go in several different dresses for one\u2019s own sake?!</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t understand well the desires of a woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, adding to that, this is the Wind Founder\u2019s wedding, so it has the influence of the whole Wind Church on the table. There\u2019s the need to make the wedding as extravagant as possible, which will also lead to showing the other churches how big the Wind Church is.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue explains as she checks the dresses.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe era of confrontation has passed, and peace is becoming the standard of the whole world, so there\u2019s nothing good in being seen lightly. The other churches will definitely send envoys to celebrate this occasion, so we have to make a grand wedding that will awe them!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Well, Karen-san and I are like the envoys of the Light Church in a sense.</p><br/><p>We only noticed at the moment we arrived though.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we are going to make it extravagant, changing the dresses once or twice won\u2019t be enough. Ten times, twenty times\u2026no, we should change it 100 times, maybe 200 times.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t that make her change all the time in the wedding?!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a problem with that\u2026\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue\u2019s bitter gaze turns towards a certain direction and we follow it.</p><br/><p>At the place we focused our gazes in, there was a ghost that felt as if she had crawled from the depths of the netherworld.</p><br/><p>This ghost is without doubt the bride of the wedding.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No matter how beautiful and luxurious of a dress we have her wear\u2026\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the person herself is like this\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The guests will most likely be in awe for a different reason \u2014mostly fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is practically a mystery why this point hasn\u2019t been addressed until now though!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the way of dealing with it had already been established, so it wasn\u2019t taken as a big problem.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>In the past, there was a time when we tried to beautify this Juo-san that looked like she had came right out of drowning in the sea, and the result was that she ended being an incredible beauty.</p><br/><p>It was as if a vengeful ghost had ascended to heaven.</p><br/><p>I have seen this purified Juo-san once, but she was so dazzling and beautiful that I don\u2019t remember it well now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san? What are you remembering~?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWah?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san whispered at my back and I felt my spine shiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026then, how about calling Celestis or Sarasa-san to beautify her by the time of the wedding?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>With the help of the water divine power that can affect the body, we can purify Juo-san.</p><br/><p>By doing that, a heavenly bride will most definitely descend in the wedding.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu, that\u2019s why this problem was not seen as a big one-de gozaru ga. But with this, it might be impossible to try on the wedding dresses-de gozaru na. For now, how about selecting the ones she should wear just by glance?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Is what the ghost bride added.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any preference. I can\u2019t go troubling my friend Sarasa all the time.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy that, you mean?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have made this.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Saying this, she points at a certain something that\u2019s at the corner of the room.</p><br/><p>Looks like\u2026a metallic capsule that a whole human can enter?</p><br/><p>We again didn\u2019t notice such a strange thing so close by us!</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter receiving the help of Sarasa and the others, I tried making this. This is an ethereal device that replicates their techniques.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! Don\u2019t tell me, you are planning on using this to\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is pretty easy to replicate the effects that the water divine power has on the body by using ethereal. With this, I can transform again!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Juo-san presses the button on the capsule.</p><br/><p>Then, the capsule opens in two as if saying \u2018come in\u2019.</p><br/><p>Juo-san enters the capsule as if this was the obvious way, and then, presses a button inside the capsule, and the capsule closes.</p><br/><p>Right now, Juo-san was completely a Schrodinger Juo-san.</p><br/><p>I can only feel uneasiness in all this, but maybe because of Juo-san operating it from the inside, the machine began to slowly move.</p><br/><p>\u2026*Wuuuun, clank*</p><br/><p>*Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep\u2014!*</p><br/><p>*Zugagagagaga!!*</p><br/><p>*Dotan, batan*</p><br/><p>*Zudodododododo!!*</p><br/><p>*Oraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraora!!!*</p><br/><p>*Dorararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararara!!*</p><br/><p>[Thank you very much!!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAwawawawa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>From inside the capsule, sounds that are definitely not natural were coming out from it?!</p><br/><p>Is the person inside okay?! Or more like, what is happening in there?!</p><br/><p>By the time our uneasiness changed to fear, the capsule that was making noises like crazy let out a groan as it stopped, and turned silent.</p><br/><p>And then, it opened slowly, and what appeared from inside it was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAloha~.\u201d</p><br/><p>A heavenly descended, purified Juo-san.</p><ul><li>354: Dress Selection</li></ul><br/><p>I just can\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>Seeing this heavenly descended being as the same person as that vengeful ghost is just\u2026</p><br/><p>Glossy black hair flowing down, skin that glows like a pearl; the two eyes of hers, that one couldn\u2019t see at all because of her previously weedy hair, were now visible and dazzling. This slightly drowsy expression of hers contrasted with the clear-headed expression of Hyue.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Tch.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-san, I have to question that habit of clicking your tongue everytime you see her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can turn into that in an instant, you should just maintain that look in your everyday life.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that side is my natural form, so don\u2019t you think that\u2019s fine?\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Well, your current form gives more of a reassuring feeling, you know\u2026</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it just fine to make the beautiful form into your actual form?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san? Why are you getting all lovestruck?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch ouch ouch ouch?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It hurts?!</p><br/><p>Karen-san is pinching my butt for some reason!</p><br/><p>I am not lovestruck or anything. I was simply admiring a beautiful woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-dono doesn\u2019t understand the heart of women-de gozaru na\u2026!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Even Hyue pitched in!</p><br/><p>And the Juo-san in question\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fuhi.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Her inside was the same as before.</p><br/><p>Well, obviously. If her personality changed along with her appearance, I wouldn\u2019t be able to trust women anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave that aside. Now that you are in that appearance, we can actually resize the dresses. Let\u2019s begin trying them on.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026For now, let\u2019s reduce the candidates. Which one to wear at the wedding ceremony? It would be better if it were as flashy as possible.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. There will be envoys of the other churches as guests, so this will also serve as a show of our change in policies from the time we were secretive. Let\u2019s make it a really flashy one.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cA plain one would give out the impression of still being secretive\u2026\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Is what Hyue and Juo-san said as they begin choosing the dresses\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cDOOOON\u2019T!!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, the one that they chose was completely dirt bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is no good-de gozaru! Even if my head understands it, my instincts ends up choosing the plain ones-de gozaru!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..We of the Wind nation try our best to not stand out, and our motto is to have an air-like presence\u2026 Even if asked to choose a flashy dress now\u2026\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>What a praiseworthy nature you have been born with, Wind people.</p><br/><p>They have been tasked with the duty of hiding since the time they were born, the very place they live in is always in motion, and it is the church that no one could put a finger on; being unable to suddenly stand-out might not be that much of a surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026If you want\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san raises her hand nervously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about I check the dresses?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-dono will?!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wind people can\u2019t choose flashy designs. In that case, I as someone of the Light nation, might be able to take a different perspective about it. Since I am already here, please let me help out.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-dono!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue firmly took the hand of Karen-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly grateful! If Karen-dono of the Light nation is to oversee this, I am sure we will be able to find a dazzlingly flashy dress in no time-de gozaru!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Hyue-chan?! In what light do you see the Light Church?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>True.</p><br/><p>Do you think the Light Church that worships the Light Goddess Inflation would be a bunch of eccentric people\u2026\u2026wait, that might not be wrong?</p><br/><p>\u201cFine!! See! This is the one I have chosen. My favorite wedding dress!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>What Karen-san pulled out was\u2026a pure white dress that was way too loyal to the basics.</p><br/><p>In a sense, it looked like white like snow, and released a radiance that could dazzle the eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh! The white color easily shines and stands out! So the basics is the way to go, is that right-de gozaru?!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood job, light hero\u2026!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Looks like Hyue and Juo-san were satisfied with Karen-san\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s try it out at once, Juo! If there\u2019s an issue with the size, we have to resize it at once! We have short time to do that!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes, ma\u2019am\u2026!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Hyue and company were going at high pace. At that time\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, please.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san stepped in again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry to stop you when you are in a hurry, but I have another proposal.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cA proposal?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>What in the world would Karen-san propose?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about Hyue-san also tries out the dresses?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Hyue was greatly confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean-de gozaru, Karen-dono?! I am not the one getting married but this woman-de gozaru zo! There\u2019s no point in anyone other than her wearing a dress-de gozaran ka!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is meaning. We will be comparing how it will look in differing heights.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c?!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClothes give off quite the different impression depending on the height of the person wearing it. There\u2019s designs that go better for plump people, as well as ones that look good on slender ones. We will be comparing to see which one it is for each dress.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words\u2026Juo and I?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Now that she mentions it, these two girls have quite the contrasting body build.</p><br/><p>Because of her work as a scientist, Juo-san\u2019s body is decently plump, and her breasts and butt have volume.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Hyue has trained her body, so her body is well-toned, and looks like an herbivorous beast that\u2019s specialized in running. And the breasts to match that body\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d *Bang!*</p><br/><p>\u201cUoo?! That was dangerous!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Hyue had silently shot her gun?!</p><br/><p>I guarded myself with dark matter right before it hit me, but Hyue really is quite radical in her reactions!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fuhi, tiny breasts seal of approval.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Friction was happening between Juo and Hyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine! Hyue-chan\u2019s small breasts are efficient small breasts!! They are made in a way so they don\u2019t obstruct your job as a hero!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if Karen-dono -a hero that has pretty big breasts- tells me, it doesn\u2019t sound convincing!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Calling them efficient small breasts made my heart throb for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs proof of that, Hyue-chan\u2019s whole body is well balanced, and has a smoothness like that of a cat! It is a body build that is practically fated to have small breasts as the most beautiful part of it!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell if you are complimenting me or picking a fight with me!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is exactly because of Hyue-chan that we can compare it with Juo-san on the same dress!! Now then, you two, change clothes!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The ultimate pushiness of Karen-san had now activated.</p><br/><p>When Karen-san is like that, the only one who would be able to stop her is Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand! I will do what Karen-dono says, so just\u2026!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue\u2019s embarrassed expression is directed at me.</p><br/><p>Ah, well, of course.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be waiting outside.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c[Holy Light, *Nekodamashi*]\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It was in an instant.</p><br/><p>Karen-san, who had walked right in front of me, had both of her hands release an incredible amount of light, and dazzled my vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy eyes!! My EYEEEEEESS!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I can\u2019t see anything!!</p><br/><p>It was such a strong light that I felt as if my retinas had been burned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce in the effect of this \u2018Holy Light, Nekodamashi\u2019, your vision won\u2019t return for a while. With this, there won\u2019t be any worries of being peeked at when changing.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWas there a need to do that?! Wouldn\u2019t it have been okay to just leave the place?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOut of room doesn\u2019t mean out of means.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a hell of a paranoia there!</p><br/><p>Damn it. My eyesight will properly return, right? I feel as if this will definitely leave some sort of lasting damage.</p><br/><p>At any rate, it doesn\u2019t feel right to stand still when I am unable to see anything, so I tried to fumble my way to the wall, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026*Squish*</p><br/><p>I touched something soft.</p><br/><p>\u201cKYAAAAAAAAA!!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>And Karen-san lets out a cute scream.</p><br/><p>I would call this divine punishment.</p><br/><p>Now then, which part did I touch?</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-349-351-the-insecure-hero\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 349-351 - The insecure hero\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-355-357-a-love-comedy-of-three\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 355-357 - A love-comedy of three\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236388\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

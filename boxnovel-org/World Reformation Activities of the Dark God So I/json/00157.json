If it were to be on the verge of being wiped out, he might come out. It would be wrapped up faster than straightforwardly searching inside the Wind capital.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>You might say that\u2019s the faster way, but even if we were to search the whole world, I am pretty sure the only one who would be able to do something like this is Haine-san. And before all that, I think that the only one who can defeat that army of small-sized monsters is Haine-san.</p><br/><p>If I am not careful, my mind might go completely blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s one other reason why Haine-san is going wild like that in the sky.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is something simple. If he goes that wild at the main body of the flies and decreases their numbers, the flies that go down will also decrease equally in numbers. As proof, there\u2019s not that many around us, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Now that she mentions it\u2026</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan is still doing her best with her fire, but contrary to that, there\u2019s no presence of the black smoke in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san is trying to reduce the encroachment of the flies towards the humans as much as possible, that\u2019s why he plunged in there\u2026\u2026 Now, let\u2019s not waste the consideration of Haine-san. Let\u2019s escape the city fast, and regroup with the light knights outside.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The knights from the Aurora Knight corps that had accompanied us should be under attack as well. The Ignis Militant corps, the Stream Marine corps, and the Scorched Earth Annihilation corps too.</p><br/><p>We should return to where they are and fulfill our duties as heroes!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry everyone! \u2014Wait.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Just as I was hyped up, I noticed that everyone was acting strange.</p><br/><p>We have to hurry and return, and yet, no one was moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Let\u2019s move everyone! Every grain in the hourglass is precious, you know?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I was suddenly shouted at by Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to raise your voice that much!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I understand. Because you were entranced by your beloved prince, you didn\u2019t notice, right?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Beloved?! Beloved, she said!</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chi, lend me that for a moment.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAhn, mah snacks!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan sticks her hand in Sasae-chan\u2019s pocket without permission and takes it out. And from there, Celestis-chan was holding a snack bag that is widely sold in Apollon City.</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan throws that to the front.</p><br/><p>And when she did\u2026</p><br/><p>*Bang!! Bang Bang!*</p><br/><p>A sound that felt as if it could pierce my eardrums rang as the snack bag was torn asunder in mid-air.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGyaaa~su!! Mah snack~~!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan wails.</p><br/><p>After being torn to that many pieces, there\u2019s no way anyone can eat them anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. We can\u2019t show it with a person, right? Someone is aiming at us from somewhere. And it is trying to prevent us from leaving here.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAiming? Preventing?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you don\u2019t know why Mirack-chi is still spreading her fire, right? You really are just looking at the person you like! Oi, Mirack-chi, as expected, this girl doesn\u2019t even see you~.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it! I will get so sad that my support will weaken, damn it!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan shouted in sadness.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026the reason why Mirack-chan is releasing fire even when there\u2019s no flies is because\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cTo conceal us. Against the sniper that we don\u2019t know where it is aiming at us from.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Sniper.</p><br/><p>The reason why the snacks of Sasae-chan were torn to pieces was because someone shot them from somewhere?</p><br/><p>Like the air bullets the Wind Founder and hero Shiva was using in the fight with Haine-san not that long ago?!</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026Shiva-san himself is attacking us?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows. If Haine-chi\u2019s words are correct, that thin man should have hidden himself to protect his win, so I don\u2019t think he would just so readily come out. And I also feel like this is slightly different from his style.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cStyle?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat good-looking bastard used a projectile weapon, but he clashed from the front, and while mixing martial arts, he fought at close to middle range. But the person that is aiming at us from who-knows-where is probably sniping us at quite the long range.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>It is also possible that Shiva-san has changed his style, but the possibility is low.</p><br/><p>I try looking at the surroundings.</p><br/><p>In this training space, there\u2019s not much obstructions, moreover, there\u2019s a number of spires around.</p><br/><p>If someone were to be hidden in one of them and aiming at us\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-chan is spreading her fire here and there because she is concealing us and using it as a shield. If what\u2019s being shot is air bullets, due to the affinities, the fire has an advantage.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe finally have the chance to utilize the element advantage. But looking at the situation as a whole, things are still going pretty bad though.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Even if Mirack-chan is creating a firewall, if we were to take one step out, we will get sniped.</p><br/><p>If the other party\u2019s objective is to prevent us from regrouping with the people outside\u2026no, to prevent us from escaping from here\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhichever it is, just who in the world has set this up?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s only one thing that comes to mind, don\u2019t you think?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan makes a vulgar smile that she doesn\u2019t do in her times as an idol but frequently appears when she is in hero mode.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Wind capital, Rudras Metropolis. It is the military force of the Wind Church, the Whirlwind Raid corps.\u201d (Celestis)</p><ul><li>158: Children of Shiva</li></ul><br/><p>Whirlwind Raid corps.</p><br/><p>The Wind Church\u2019s military power that is worthy of standing in the same position as the Light Church\u2019s Aurora Knight corps, and the Fire Church\u2019s Ignis Militant corps.</p><br/><p>Only that name has been passed to the other churches, but in terms of the details about it, they are shrouded in mystery, just like their church.</p><br/><p>Since stepping into this Rudras Metropolis as a special case, we haven\u2019t seen almost anyone aside from Shiva.</p><br/><p>A notification was probably send to all the city and they were hidden in a way that we wouldn\u2019t catch sight of them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah, now that I think about it, the people that had guided us\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>There were several other people aside from the Founder that served as the guides or surveillance\u2026but before I noticed, they were already gone.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Celestis-chan was still throwing a number of snack bags, and was having the sniper -who we still don\u2019t know where it is- shoot them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are ya doing-dasu ka, Celestis-neechan! Please don\u2019t sacrifice more of mah snack-dasu~~!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cShat ap! Once we return alive, I will buy you twice as many! But\u2026damn it. I wanted to locate the sniper\u2019s position with this, but I can\u2019t tell at all!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s being shot is an air bullet, so there\u2019s no color and form after all.</p><br/><p>More importantly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s prioritize a way to escape. Mirack-chan\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Karen?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan continues protecting us with a wall of fire.</p><br/><p>It feels like she is incredibly happy that I called her name.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you move while still forming the wall of fire? If possible, I want us to reach a cover where we can block the sniper.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEasy peasy! If it\u2019s for you, I can go all the way to the horizon!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you getting a bit over-exhilarated?</p><br/><p>Well, it is better than not having energy, so let\u2019s move slowly while being protected by Mirack-chan\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It doesn\u2019t look like it will go so smoothly.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe surroundings be turning bad-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>It looks like Celestis-chan and Sasae-chan have noticed something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Being pointed out this, I look at the surroundings.</p><br/><p>We were already surrounded.</p><br/><p>By several tens of people that looked pretty brawny. They all wore the same garments, and that\u2019s exactly why I could tell at a glance that they are a coordinated team.</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t have any metallic-like armor on their bodies, but from their head to the toes, they were covered completely in cloth; clothing that screams stealth.</p><br/><p>This is probably the Whirlwind Raid corp.</p><br/><p>Beasts that had erased their presence, had now appeared with their fangs showing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad. We are completely surrounded. The sniping until now must have been to buy time for this encirclement to be completed.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThese numbers\u2026it doesn\u2019t feel like they are trying to keep us in place, it feels as if they are going to try killing us just like that. I can only think that the Wind Church has finally gone crazy.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>At our side, there\u2019s the Founders and heroes, 4 of each -if we count Doraha, there\u2019s 9 in total.</p><br/><p>On the other side, there\u2019s brawny people that can be called experienced fighters.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mirack-chan, at my signal, undo the wall of fire.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. Leave the vanguard to me. I have good affinity against them after all.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWith us being encircled like this, melee combat is unavoidable, so there\u2019s no shit like vanguard here. Even so, Sasae-chi, take care while fighting, got it? Wind is the natural enemy of earth after all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cGotcha-dasu! After the fight with Great Pillar-sama, I got trained by Sobo-chan. Now be the time to show demn results-dasu! It be my chance to raise a name for mahself in Rudras Metropolis-dasu yo!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Could it be that the reason why the darkness of Sasae-chan has been thicker lately is because of the training with her Obaa-san?</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-chan also said this but, in this situation, melee combat is unavoidable. So there should be no worries about any sniping due to fear of friendly fire. Let\u2019s not get distracted with defeating the enemies, and just as we planned at first, let\u2019s aim to escape the Wind capital. Doraha-san.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>The dark skin girl here, Doraha-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to request of you to be the bodyguard of the Founders. We will be opening the way.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Haine-san is desperately fighting in the sky. We can\u2019t just stay dilly-dallying here.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d \u201cOu!\u201d \u201cYes,ma\u2019am!\u201d \u201cDasu yo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan undid the wall of fire.</p><br/><p>Using that as the signal, we instantly go on the offensive. Even if the Whirlwind Raid corps are the Wind Church\u2019s military power, there\u2019s no way normal soldiers would be able to defeat heroes.</p><br/><p>Sorry but, I will be pushing you away!</p><br/><p>\u201cGuaaaa!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was at that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>That voice just now was Mirack-chan?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay, Mirack-chi?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I blocked it with fire divine power\u2026but there\u2019s still sniping?! Do they not fear hitting their allies?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The sniping doesn\u2019t stop?</p><br/><p>It was incorrect to change our strategy to match the melee combat.</p><br/><p>But the Raid corps that were encircling us had come rushing at us as if it was a matter of course, and the melee combat begins just as we thought.</p><br/><p>This is also just as we thought, but the members of the Raid corps are using wind divine power, even so, they are not that strong. In our eyes, they are not troublesome opponents, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHiaaaaa!! Dangerous-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>An air bullet scraped close to where Sasae-chan was standing. She was moving around, so it must have fortunately missed in the timing.</p><br/><p>The sniping is really not stopping. Even when we are in melee combat, they have the confidence of hitting us without hitting their allies?!</p><br/><p>Moreover, the bullets that are being shot are scarily accurate, and there have been practically no misses until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet there be hot-bloodedness!\u201d (Enou)</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?! Are you okay?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet there be hot-bloodedness.\u201d (Enou)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved! It hit the muscles in your chest so you were okay huh!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The only ones who are okay being hit are the fire hero, Mirack-chan, and the Fire Founder-sama.</p><br/><p>Those two that hold an elemental advantage against wind can simply clad a thin film of fire divine power and mitigate the air bullets.</p><br/><p>But the others don\u2019t stand in the same advantage.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Sasae-chan and the Earth Founder-sama, that are weak against the wind element, can die instantly depending on where they are shot.</p><br/><p>\u2026Is what I thought when the Earth Founder Obaba-sama\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hngh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slapped away the air bullet with the cane in her hand?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt be certainly a precise aim. But that\u2019s exactly why the line of the shot be way too honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The amazingness of this person is at a place that has nothing to do with divine power.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-chan!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I stand back-to-back with her who is fighting around with her Miki-Moses.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe longer we fight, the more of a disadvantage we will be in!! We have to finish it in one go!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. We have grasped the situation plenty enough, right?! From here on, we are going to be steaming through!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan and I spoke in sync.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d[Mirage]!!\u201d\u201d (Karen+Celestis)</p><ul><li>159: Counterattack</li></ul><br/><p>From the spreading mist, several of us appear inside of it.</p><br/><p>Light and water\u2019s combined element \u2018Mirage\u2019.</p><br/><p>Using the light to refract the small beads of water scattered in the air, mirror images are created -the power of illusions.</p><br/><p>The illusions created inside the mist were not only those of Celestis-chan and I, there were also several of Mirack-chan, Sasae-chan, the Founder-samas as well.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d \u201c?!!\u201d \u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people of the Wind Raid corps didn\u2019t raise a single voice at all. It looks like even their silence and coordination between comrades was thorough. Do they have such strict laws?</p><br/><p>Because of their garments that were covering their whole face, I can\u2019t tell their expressions, but I can tell plenty enough that they are agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Raid corps swung its knife at us, but\u2026it was a miss.</p><br/><p>Too bad. That was a mirror image.</p><br/><p>The disturbance created by \u2018Mirage\u2019 is the most effective when in great numbers. Now that the attacks have stopped because of the confusion, this is our chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ready, Sasae?! Thanks to Karen and the extra, we have obtained time to concentrate!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes-dasu!! I be very sorry that I take more time to mix elements compared to the others-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Further at the back, there\u2019s Mirack-chan and Sasae-chan sticking to each other, mixing their fire and earth elements.</p><br/><p>With four heroes, we can support each other by using a combined element to assist a combined element.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d[Magma Ocean]!!-dasu!!\u201d\u201d (Mirack+Sasae)</p><br/><p>The floor that the two were standing on began to shine red. It then melted and turned into a muddy liquid as it undulates.</p><br/><p>The lava attack that comes from the combined elements of fire and earth element \u2018Magma\u2019.</p><br/><p>The material for this training space floor was probably brought from a mountain somewhere. By the time it turns liquid, it has already reached over the thousand degrees in temperature. A natural weapon of dangerous degree.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe earth element loses against the wind element, but I wonder what would happen when it is combined with the fire element that the wind element loses against?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe element affinities be convenient-dasu!! With this, we can negate the wind element, and a barrier with plenty heat and wideness be completed-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>In the first place, the earth element that rules over the solids possesses defensive capabilities that surpasses that of the others.</p><br/><p>In this instance, it was rendered powerless because of the affinity problem, but by mixing with the fire element, it came back in a more fearsome state.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Anyone that wants to be covered in lava from the head down, come get us!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiih! Mirack-neechan! There be any need to turn in circles while holding me-dasu ka?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan had her arms around Sasae-chan\u2019s armpit, and with her left and right hands tightly held, she made big turns.</p><br/><p>Matching those movements, the lava was whirling and waving.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what she says, Mirack-chan really does love Sasae-chan.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying small girls are her favorite treat?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan says that with an amazed face.</p><br/><p>I want to believe that the wide smile of Mirack-chan comes from her desire to protect Sasae-chan. That must be it.</p><br/><p>Anyways, the lava attack of Mirack-chan and Sasae-chan has turned the tides of this situation to our side.</p><br/><p>Because of the high temperature, the Whirlwind Raid corps people can\u2019t even get close. And the Founders are all surrounded at the inner part of the lava.</p><br/><p>With that, there\u2019s no way they will be facing any harm.</p><br/><p>The air bullets that are being shot from who-knows-where for a while now as well. Once it hits the wave of lava, it just turns to nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026the most problematic one is still the sniper. Seriously, where is it shooting from?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It is true that we don\u2019t know from where it is being shot at, and on top of that, it is quite precise. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that we used the advantage of Mirack-chan to the fullest, there would have been the chance that we would have been wiped out with just the sniping alone.</p><br/><p>Even us who are outside of the lava bulwark have not been able to narrow down the location with \u2018Mirage\u2019 after all. We are simply somehow okay.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat problem has also been solved already though. [Holy Light Blade]!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>A line of light is shot from the holy sword, Saint-George. That travelled, further, further, and further away\u2026 and hits a space where there\u2019s nothing, and makes a *Pam* sound of an explosion.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>And then, it appears, a person wearing the stealth costume of the Whirlwind Raid corps. Moreover, at its hand, it is holding a cylindrical instrument that seems to be similar to the one the Founder Shiva-san held.</p><br/><p>\u201cUo?! Eh, what?! A person came out of nowhere!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the same as our \u2018Mirage\u2019, Celestis-chan. They probably poured wind divine power in the air and distorted the light in the place, in order to deceive us that there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, they sniped at us while hidden huh. I\u2019m surprised you noticed, Karen-chi.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I look like this, I am the light hero, you know? I can notice when a place has light that is unnaturally warped.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not say that I just found it by coincidence while we were channeling \u2018Mirage\u2019.</p><br/><p>But even so, the sniper was at quite the faraway place from us. In order to reach all the way there, it would take us as much as us counting to 10 while running at full speed.</p><br/><p>The air camouflage would have probably not worked unless it was from that faraway.</p><br/><p>Even so, their precision from that faraway was a threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. That nasty sniping was done by this person huh\u2026\u2026 What, this person is the guide that was accompanying us from the very beginning.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>When the Founder Shiva-san went mad, the other guides had also disappeared, but to think we would find one hiding here.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cHiaa!! Mirack-chan?! What is it so suddenly?! You scared me!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan was suddenly right at my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, you see, the bunch is suddenly surrendering. We can\u2019t just slaughter them all, so right now, Sasae is tying them up.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Eh? Why so suddenly?</p><br/><p>It is true that the fight would turn one-sided now, but aren\u2019t they surrendering way too fast?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that fine? With this, you could say the situation has changed once more. If things go well, we might be able to bring it all the way to a win!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that, Celestis-chan?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can have these guys tell us where the Founder hero is hidden in! In this fight, as long as we capture the Founder Shiva, it will be our win! In the time Haine-chi is doing his best in the sky, we will bring down the inner citadel!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Celestis-chan grabs the collar of one of the Whirlwind Raid corps and pulls it up.</p><br/><p>It is the person that used the distortion of wind to hide and snipe us.</p><br/><p>Because of the \u2018Holy Light Blade\u2019, its eyes are going in circles. I held back, so there should be no injuries though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow there, I will be confiscating your weapon. Karen-chi, hold it.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?! Yes!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan throws the metallic cylinder at me.</p><br/><p>They shot compressed air balls from here, but the one the Wind Founder Shiva-san used was the same type, yet the shape was quite different.</p><br/><p>This gun is pretty long all around. It is longer than the blade of my holy sword, and it feels like an iron rod.</p><br/><p>This person was using this gun to snipe from quite a distance away.</p><br/><p>By making the cylinder longer, it makes it easier to aim at long range?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I will have you spill it. Where\u2019s your boss?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan was threatening her, but the sniper-san was not speaking a single word.</p><br/><p>These people have been silent from the very beginning after all.</p><br/><p>It feels as if just trying to make them part their lips would be difficult, and in this situation where time is of essence, it might be harsh.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you think you can keep silent in the face of this water hero, Celestis-chan? You\u2019ve got quite the positive outlook there. Well, we don\u2019t have much time but, let\u2019s have a nice talk, okay?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Uhm, Celestis-chan? Don\u2019t be too rough\u2014\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s talk properly while looking at each other\u2019s faces. Let\u2019s take off that mask and\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan places her hand on the mask of the person, and takes it off all at once.</p><br/><p>From inside the mask, long black hair flows down. Her bangs swung, and her thin eyebrows and long eyelashes were out in the open.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sniper was a beauty that left us with our eyes wide open.</p><ul><li>160: Sylph</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d \u201cEh?\u201d \u201cC-Cute!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I, Celestis-chan, and Mirack-chan had our own reactions.</p><br/><p>After defeating the military power of the Wind Church, the Whirlwind Raid corps, we tried taking off the mask of the most troublesome one in the group, the sniper, and what we saw was a girl \u2013a pretty beautiful one.</p><br/><p>The bridge of her nose drew a delicate arc, and her contours were thin and smooth.</p><br/><p>Her black hair overlaps with that of Yorishiro-sama, but the one here has her hair tied up in a bundle and gives out a stoic impression.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Tch.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-chan, why are you clicking your tongue?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a trait of us idols. When we see a girl that is cuter than us, we end up wanting to click our tongues.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, you know?! You and her have their different kind of beauties, but you two are beauties nonetheless!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan is the shining type of beauty, and the person here is the refined type of beauty\u2026maybe?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Umu, okay!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not talk to Mirack-chan.</p><br/><p>I can tell that things would turn complicated.</p><br/><p>More importantly, I want to hear what this person has to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, is it okay? There\u2019s a few things I want to ask about\u2014\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKill me!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>This woman spoke her first words to us.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say. Just kill me already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no no no no, we won\u2019t kill you. We won\u2019t do something that disturbing, and there\u2019s something that we would want you to tell us!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I want to hear about the hiding place of the Wind Founder Shiva.</p><br/><p>We wanted to know no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh~, I finished tying \u2018em all up-dasu yo~. I didn\u2019t think mah skills of tying up straw hemps would be coming in handy here-dasu~.\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Oh, Sasae-chan came back.</p><br/><p>It looks like she finished restraining the Whirlwind Raid corps.</p><br/><p>And then, she saw our dispute with this woman and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOya? What be going on? Torture-dasu ka? Want me to tear off her fingernails-dasu ka?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be tearing anything off!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan return please!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! So you won\u2019t be letting me die that easily huh. Fine. Give me any kind of tortures you wish. But *I* won\u2019t be saying anything unfavorable towards my brother.\u201d &lt;TL: she says \u2018sessha\u2019 which is \u2018I\u2019 in a samurai-like way&gt;</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no! Please don\u2019t accept the situation so easily!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>We won\u2019t be doing any abuse here!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hey, this girl just now\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, she acts tough, but she is a careless one.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>It looks like Celestis-chan and Mirack-chan are muttering something, but you two, please help me calm down this situation!</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t retort to all this on my own!</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, Karen-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?! Yorishiro-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, I totally left them outside my peripheric, but the Founders are all okay.</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Sasae-chan were protecting them with lava after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like the Wind believer here has something to say.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I noticed that there\u2019s one Raid corp member walking to where we are while still tied up.</p><br/><p>In order to make it easier to speak to, that person also has his mask off, but it looks like this one is a normal man.</p><br/><p>\u201cI ask of you people. I will speak about what you want to know. That\u2019s why, please don\u2019t bring harm to this personage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, have you lost it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman bites heavily at the words of her comrade, but she can\u2019t change the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease forgive me. If something were to happen to you, that in itself would be something that wouldn\u2019t allow me to face Shiva-sama!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Raid corp man was obedient.</p><br/><p>In the time I was suffering with these comedy troupe here, how did Yorishiro-sama manage to make this man open up?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, tell me this first.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan asks first.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis girl that you are going so far to protect, just who is she?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The man, that had promised to say anything, left a space of silence before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis personage is Toreido Hyue-sama. She is Founder Shiva-sama\u2019s little sister, and is a gunner that would compete for first and second place in the Kazama Shinobis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. So the \u2018brother\u2019 meant exactly that huh.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like we have reeled a bigger fish than we expected.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>This is bad. Celestis-chan is making a face that\u2019s unfitting of an idol.</p><br/><p>But Celestis-chan is not the only bad person here.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If push comes to shove, let\u2019s use this girl as bait to lure out the Wind Founder-sama.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama nonchalantly says things that everyone would have a hard time saying!</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t feel numb or admire that part of hers, okay?!</p><br/><p>\u201cFor emergency situations, there be the need for emergency measures-dasu na?! Cool-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Sasae-chan, don\u2019t go getting influenced by this person! It definitely won\u2019t be good for your education!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>This is not good. Everyone is going crazy here!</p><br/><p>My retorts won\u2019t be enough. Please return quickly, Haine-san!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u2014PLEASE!!\u201d</p><br/><p>And while we were making a racket, the woman in question -Hyue-san- let out a desperate voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease! Only a small amount of time is fine. Please don\u2019t get in the way of Aniue-sama &lt;brother&gt;! Please let him achieve his objective!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeeeeeh?\u201d</p><br/><p>We felt bewilderment at the supplication of Hyue-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that way of saying it? It is as if we are being made the bad guys here.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe objective of the Wind Founder Shiva is to use the Mother Monster, control the the envoys of the five Churches, and bring calamity to the whole world. Do you think we would keep silent and let him achieve it?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I heard the sound of grinding teeth.</p><br/><p>It was a loud sound that would make me wonder if the teeth would break with that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are wrong. Aniue-sama doesn\u2019t intend to do that! He is actually an incredibly kind person. But that notice suddenly made Aniue-sama strange &lt;the call for the conference&gt;! In order to have Aniue-sama return to his former kind self, we have to defeat that man, and have Aniue-sama achieve his objective!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I wanted to hear in more detail, but when I tried to, someone interjected -it was Yorishiro-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You really do love your brother dearly.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyue-san must have felt a ghastly sensation from the casual tone of Yorishiro-sama. She falls silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, can you please tell us? Who is the one that Shiva-san is trying to defeat? What is it that the Wind Mother Monster mayhem is actually trying to achieve? Just what kind of human he truly is. Can you tell us?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-155-156-the-way-to-carry-out-one%E2%80%99s-duty\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 155-156 - The way to carry out one\u2019s duty\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-161-162-at-the-summit\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 161-162 - At the summit\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236310\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

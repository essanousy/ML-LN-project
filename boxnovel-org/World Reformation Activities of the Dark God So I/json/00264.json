MEDIC\u2014!!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I called out for a medic, but I soon gulped my breath.</p><br/><p>This is still within the pressure field of Michael. Even if regular folks were to run here, they will simply end up bound.</p><br/><p>Treating an injured is more impossible than a dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis! You can\u2019t die! Please keep breathing! You can\u2019t close your eyes!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I desperately tried to keep the consciousness of Sis Kyouka that felt as if it were about to go away.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Mirack\u2026YOU IDIOT!!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka used all her strength to glare back at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you forget where you are right now?! The direction you should be facing is to the front!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>!!</p><br/><p>When I turn my head as Sis Kyouka reprimanded, a giant man big like a mountain was standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael\u2026!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>He was already the very representation of despair.</p><br/><p>He looked down at us without saying anything. The moment I noticed that, I knew I messed up.</p><br/><p>What an idiot I was. It was a given that I would be scolded by Sis Kyouka that\u2019s on the verge of death.</p><br/><p>I had my enemy so close, and yet, I was showing my back full of openings.</p><br/><p>If he had swung his fist down at that time, it would have been the end of everything.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Why aren\u2019t you doing anything?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>While covering for Sis Kyouka who was down, I face Michael.</p><br/><p>Even if it turned into a fight, I don\u2019t have the confidence that I would be able to last a second though.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you already. You have the qualification to be my opponent.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>The giant lets out a voice that felt as if it could create a tremor.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonsters are the race that should be the rulers of all things. The summit has to show pride. Getting a victory by taking advantage of the weakness of your opponent in an underhanded manner would make you lower than an insect. It isn\u2019t an action you can take pride in.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, my opponent, fight me. In order to judge the fate of our existence, the ones that are my opponents shouldn\u2019t die groveling on the ground but standing. Or will you curl up crying and once again lose the qualification to be my opponent?\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If I lose it, what will happen?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I will simply step on you as I would with an insect.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>How egoistic!</p><br/><p>It is humiliating, but I managed to stay alive because of his own sense of self-satisfaction huh.</p><br/><p>I decide to provide quick treatment to Sis Kyouka, at least to reduce the bleeding, and then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnis Militant corps!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Without minding, I call to my allies at the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetreat! Retreat!! Move back to a distance where the pressure of the Demon Lord can\u2019t reach, and confront the other monsters from there! The Demon Lord\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u2026The Demon Lord\u2026</p><br/><p>I lost my words for a moment there.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t cower here! Let it all out!! In one breath!!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will hold back the Demon Lord!! This fire hero Mirack will!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Even if those words were a bluff, they served as encouragement to the hearts of the fire militants.</p><br/><p>They dragged their bodies back, and orderly get out of the pressure area of the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are prioritizing the fight of the army rather than this one huh. Is that the style of you heroes?\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026A hero exists to protect the powerless people from the monsters. If the Demon Lords are the strongest monsters, there\u2019s no other than a hero to defeat them!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I take a battle stance and face this giant.</p><br/><p>His pressure continued to attack me, and if I were to let my guard down for a second, I feel like all my joints might break and I would collapse.</p><br/><p>But even so, I will stand with the intention of scraping away my lifespan.</p><br/><p>If I get out of this alive, after this fight ends, I think I will end up with a head full of gray hair, but that\u2019s still the better case.</p><br/><p>Because in this fight, the possibility of surviving is a lot lower after all.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You managed to resist my pressure and made the frontline pull back; that was good judgement. But it doesn\u2019t provide an actual solution.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>The tone of Michael didn\u2019t show any ridicule or contempt, but there was an overwhelming animosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that if they fall back, they will be able to escape my pressure. Then, if I do one step forward\u2026\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>And in reality, he did take one step forward.</p><br/><p>*Doshin!*</p><br/><p>When his feet touched the ground, a heavy sound was let out and it felt as if the ground trembled.</p><br/><p>I unconsciously take one step back at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You people will have to take a step back. If you continue doing that, what will happen? In this direction, this so called homeland you should protect is supposed to be there.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>It was just as Michael said.</p><br/><p>At our back, there\u2019s thousands of people living in Muspelheim.</p><br/><p>We have to absolutely stop them from reaching there.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, in actuality, we shouldn\u2019t be allowed to even take a step back.</p><br/><p>In the first place, at my back, there\u2019s something that\u2019s closer than Muspelheim; Sis Kyouka lays there.</p><br/><p>It took the fire militants their all to get away from the territory of Michael and they didn\u2019t have the leeway to bring Sis along with them.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t blame them.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how powerful the pressure of this guy is.</p><br/><p>In other words, I have no choice but to defeat Michael without making one more step back.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no choice but that!</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I am the only one here.</p><br/><p>The comrades I am always fighting together with are not here today.</p><br/><p>Their lands are far away from here. There\u2019s no convenient development like them coming to my help.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Karen, Celestis, Sasae, Hyue; even if we are separated, you give me strength.</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire hero, Katack Mirack! Onwards!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only one thing I can do against the Demon Lord that is leaps and bounds superior to me.</p><br/><p>Hit him with my strongest attack \u2014using all of my strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire fist, Barbarossa! Change my divine power into fire!! A flash that burns stronger than fire!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I bend down and pull back my left fist plenty, as if my the fist clad in the fire knuckle was pulling a bow.</p><br/><p>After placing plenty enough divine power, I push out my fist at full speed.</p><br/><p>The technique I gained from training with Karen and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Fire Fist Line]!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The beam that was released from my fist was the Fire Fist Line!</p><br/><p>The fire divine power that originally holds the strongest area of effect power, instead concentrates the power in a set range and a high temperature attack is possible.</p><br/><p>Fire Fist, pierce through the Demon Lord with this!!</p><br/><p>\u201cGugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fire Fist that stretched from my fist had struck the chest of the Demon Lord directly.</p><br/><p>That much was a given.</p><br/><p>Now all that\u2019s left is whether my Fire Fist will pierce or not through his chest that looked as if it were sturdier than a castle wall!!</p><ul><li>265: Heat of burning blood</li></ul><br/><p>The new technique, Fire Fist Line.</p><br/><p>A technique I created using Karen\u2019s \u2018Holy Light Line\u2019 as reference.</p><br/><p>Rather than taking advantage of the fire\u2019s trait of increasing the range as far as the output gives, you concentrate it at one point and increase its piercing power.</p><br/><p>If we can\u2019t burn it all, pierce a vital point.</p><br/><p>Pierce.</p><br/><p>\u201cPIERCEEEE!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord Michael who had received that \u2018Fire Fist Line\u2019 with his chest had lowered his waist and was resisting it; receiving my strongest attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cGunuuu!!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Stop it.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t resist it. Quickly get pierced by it.</p><br/><p>From within the techniques I have, this is the technique that holds the strongest offensive power while sacrificing the area of effect.</p><br/><p>If this Fire Fist Line is defeated, there\u2019s essentially no way for me to defeat Michael.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, don\u2019t be reserved and just get pierced already!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>My desire was mercilessly broken.</p><br/><p>Michael simply pushed his chest out and repelled my divine power, and the fire fist was turned into small sparks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a pretty good attack.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael\u2019s chest only had a slight burn mark on it, moreover, that burn soon regenerated and was gone.</p><br/><p>I lost\u2026!</p><br/><p>My brain was filled with that single word.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s already no method for me to defeat Michael.</p><br/><p>\u201cE\u2026Even if humans are eradicated\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I say this with a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonsters won\u2019t be able to rule the world. The Mother Monsters are gone! In exchange for giving birth to you Demon Lords!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh\u2026\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cA living form that can\u2019t procreate can\u2019t become the ruler of nature! The monsters\u2026and you Demon Lords will be the last of your species!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>It was completely the bark of a losing dog.</p><br/><p>Now that I have lost the way to defeat him, what came out from my mouth were the barks of a sore loser that couldn\u2019t think before speaking. What a pathetic feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that?\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael spreads out the fire wings that were basically his symbol and fanned them once.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hot wind that was created from that single flap made me cover my face to protect it. Moreover, from inside that hot wind there was something inside. Small specs of dust\u2026 ashes?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mother, the Fire Mother Monster, the immortal bird Phoenix used her own body covered in flames to burn herself and was giving birth to monsters from those ashes.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me\u2026!</p><br/><p>The ashes that were send flying from the flap of Michael\u2026every ash became bigger, and in time, take the shape of a living being, and begin to operate.</p><br/><p>From each one of the ashes, one fire element monster was born?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe Demon Lords have inherited the trait of our now deceased Mother Monsters, therefore, we Demon Lords will be the source of monster prosperity.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Then\u2026the reason for the bothering mystery of the monsters appearing from nowhere in this battle was because Michael was making them right as they went?!</p><br/><p>The army of monsters that the Ignis militant corps are desperately trying to stop as well.</p><br/><p>Then, this Demon Lord Michael is truly the source of our crisis.</p><br/><p>No matter how many monsters we defeat, as long as we don\u2019t defeat Michael, this won\u2019t make a turn at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cI see that you are out of hands. I as well have taken too much time, and if that Kuromiya Haine were to appear, it would trouble me. Let\u2019s hurry with my job.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>At that moment, I noticed another despairing thing.</p><br/><p>The fire element monsters that Michael gave birth to show me were mostly fire bird types.</p><br/><p>It is not on the level of the Phoenix that gave birth to Michael himself, but they were falcon and crow types.</p><br/><p>Meaning that they are going to use flying!</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Wait!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>It was just as I imagined.</p><br/><p>They spread their wings and flew high into the sky towards Muspelheim.</p><br/><p>This means\u2026they are going to fly over the defense line that the Ignis militant corps set up!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for the winged ones to play along with the people stuck on the ground. I will give a quick sky burial to this so called Muspelheim.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I immediately released a [Flame Burst] and try to burn down all the birds that were about to fly away.</p><br/><p>But the number of birds that Michael created were many and it wasn\u2019t something that only my flames could burn down.</p><br/><p>Moreover\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaa?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWorrying about something else when you are facing me. Should I call that boldness?\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>That was close!</p><br/><p>I instinctively evaded the fist of Michael.</p><br/><p>If it had hit, it would have ended right that instant.</p><br/><p>While dealing with this Michael that was impossible to defeat, I had to eliminate all the hundreds of small fire birds!</p><br/><p>\u2026No good.</p><br/><p>A decent amount were already outside my range and were heading to Muspelheim.</p><br/><p>I already have no means to stop them.</p><br/><p>At this rate, the people of Muspelheim will be eaten by them.</p><br/><p>Did I fail in my duty as a hero?!</p><br/><p>But at that moment\u2026!</p><br/><p>*Gooooon!!*</p><br/><p>\u201cLet there be hot-bloodedness!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A fire dragon bursted far at the back. The fire birds were burned down without leaving a single one behind.</p><br/><p>That technique! And that phrase!!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>My Master and the Fire Founder; that big frame that doesn\u2019t lose to even the Demon Lord Michael was standing straight with pride.</p><br/><p>\u2026No, it is not only Master. At his surroundings, there\u2019s uncountable amount of people.</p><br/><p>Could that be\u2026! The whole force of the Ignis Militant corps?!</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-oneesama!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have come to save you. Are you okay?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Arrived like a flash, resolve everything in a flash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Braidley, Glassfin, and Firey were there.</p><br/><p>The people that I ordered to standby at the back, the people that were at the surroundings of Muspelheim and couldn\u2019t make it in time for the gathering; are you telling me they have all gathered in this battlefield?!</p><br/><p>A concentration of all the power?!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That high temperature attack just now was the strongest technique passed down in the Ignis Militant corps, \u2018Grand Melt\u2019\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>From my feet, I heard a weak voice.</p><br/><p>The voice of the heavily injured Sis Kyouka?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a joint attack between many fire militants releasing fire divine power together. The more fire militants join, the higher the power.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>That attack just now was a \u2018Grand Melt\u2019 that utilized the whole of Muspelheim\u2019s Ignis militant corps?</p><br/><p>No wonder it had crazy firepower! It can easily wipe out a flock of birds!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is obvious, and yet, when I actually see it with my own eyes, it is aweing. With the joint power of the whole fire militants, they can easily surpass the power of a single hero. Why didn\u2019t we notice such a simple thing?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>On top of that, to think that Master who had left the battlefield to become a Founder had joined the fray as well.</p><br/><p>Leaving the current Militant General at his side, Master says his usual words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet there be hot-bloodedness!!\u201d (Enou)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. What am I as a fire hero doing letting my blood freeze in front of a crisis?</p><br/><p>My body has hot burning blood circulating.</p><br/><p>That burning blood creates fire divine power!!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what our Master had taught us in the end to Sis Kyouka and I.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, that person always says this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet there be hot-bloodedness!!\u201d (Enou)</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnis Militant corps! Begin battle!\u201d \u201cHero-sama! We will also fight!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of an army if they don\u2019t protect their homeland!!\u201d \u201cLet your blood boil! Heat up your heart!!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t get cocky, monsters!!\u201d \u201cWatch the stubbornness of humans!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fire militants were plenty hot-blooded as well.</p><br/><p>That heat began to infect the blood in my body as well.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The monsters that I send ahead have been wiped out huh. What an agile bunch.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>And within all this, Michael was indifferent.</p><br/><p>You won\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>This heat that resides within us humans.</p><br/><p>Let there be hot-bloodedness!</p><br/><p>The fight is still not over!</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-261-263-suffering-of-the-fire-capital\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 261-263 - Suffering of the Fire capital\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-266-267-all-out-battle\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 266-267 - All-out battle\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236353\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

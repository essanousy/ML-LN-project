A month filled with celebration. But that is exactly why it is one of the most busiest month, if not the busiest one.</p><br/><p>Because of this, the chapter releases might get a bit erratic in this month and the beginnings of January. I will still try to keep the release schedule as 3-4 days, but keep in mind that sometimes it might take slightly longer.</p><br/><p>Anyways, enjoy the chapter! :DDDDD!</p><hr/><br/><p>She vaguely resembles Karen-san. Even so, she isn\u2019t like Karen-san at all.</p><br/><p>She is truly a strange woman that applies to both of these statements.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s parts that resemble each other, but there\u2019s even more parts that are completely opposite.</p><br/><p>If I had to put it in words, it would be a \u2018Black Karen-san\u2019.</p><br/><p>However, the clothes she is wearing, the accessories, her hair, and the color of her eyes don\u2019t have a single black component, and yet, I got that impression from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that Black Karen?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cOr more like, Dark Karen-chi?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Mirack and Celestis seem to have gotten the same impression.</p><br/><p>The arrival of this mysterious woman, in what way will it affect this situation?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe previous light hero, Sunnysol Ates-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san mutters this as if faltering.</p><br/><p>Is that the name of that pseudo-Karen that has a black presence coming out of her? Moreover, another previous hero?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with today? Is this a festival of previous heroes?</p><br/><p>\u201cLong time no see, Karen-san. Since the time I retired, right? I was unable to attend your hero ceremony after all.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2026are you here?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The attitude of Karen-san in the face of this Ates that looks to be in her twenties was something I something I haven\u2019t seen before. How to say it, it is as if a small kitten had encountered an adult female cat.</p><br/><p>If Karen-san had a tail in her rear, there\u2019s no doubt that all of its hairs would be standing up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy junior was so disappointing, I had to come here to put an end to it.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeh?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san shouts in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that you too came here to talk about the Hero Alliance?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Then it would be the same as Kyouka and Sarasa over there.</p><br/><p>What in the world is going on?</p><br/><p>Reacting to the current heroes joining hands, all the past heroes have begun to move all at once?</p><br/><p>\u201cLately, there have been many voices speaking out to me, you know?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Is what the previous hero says as she mixes sarcasm in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said that current hero is way too arbitrary in her actions and it is too much to deal with, and that you are trying to destroy the old conventions. There have been so many complains coming to me that I can\u2019t overlook it anymore, so I decided to stand up to it.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>A new voice resounds in the parlor room.</p><br/><p>For a while now, there has been a radical increase in the amount of people here!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Yorishiro-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Light Founder!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is Yorishiro-chi!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Several people call the name of the new person that appeared -the Light Founder, Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>She can be said to be the leader of the Light Church, and even without that, she is a person that possesses prudence, foresight, and beauty; there\u2019s no person that can remain calm when encountering her.</p><br/><p>And yet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, Yorishiro-sama, it has been long.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates-san doesn\u2019t look like she is getting agitated at all.</p><br/><p>She is a former light hero, so she should at least be acquainted with Yorishiro. There\u2019s no way she doesn\u2019t know about how fearsome that woman is.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard that you have been doing a lot lately, so that popularity reaches my ears everyday even when I have already retired.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you want to say is bad reputation, right? Ates-san, when you relinquished your title as the hero, you promised you wouldn\u2019t be stepping into this Light Grand Church ever again. I won\u2019t let you say that you forgot.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Founder. The affection that I received from you, this Sunnysol Ates hasn\u2019t forgotten about it for a single day.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, depart from this place at once. If you continue being so disobedient, I can order to have you thrown out not only from the Light Grand Church but also from Apollon City.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>An incredible amount of sparks suddenly began scattering!</p><br/><p>The sparks were flying so violently that all the other people watching were scared and stepped back. Even I have already retreated to the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, Karen-san!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I silently circumvented towards Karen-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust who in the world is she? That Ates person, why is there such an explosive mood here?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>When I asked this, Karen-san answered with a pained expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunnysol Ates-sama. Just as I said before, she is the one who was in the position of hero before me. She is an incredibly excelling person, and in her active days, she defeated several hundreds of monsters alone. Everyone said that her name would remain in the history of the Light Church.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>But Karen-san continues.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes-sama suddenly stopped being a hero and left the Light Church just as suddenly. The one who was appointed as the light hero after her was me. I have practically not heard anything about her even in my days as an apprentice hero and have had no interactions with her before.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>She is more and more of an ominous hero now.</p><br/><p>Especially while looking at her figure that is straightforwardly facing Yorishiro head on.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Founder Yorishiro-sama, I have not forgotten my gratitude towards you. That\u2019s why, I can\u2019t just silently look at the distress that the Light Church is currently in.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cDistress\u2026you say?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, the Light Church is on the verge of falling \u2013by the hands of a part of people that want to rewrite the past conventions.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>That is of course referring to us.</p><br/><p>She is most likely talking about the Hero Alliance that Karen-san is trying to make reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the Light Church, the Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind Churches are enemies just like the monsters. And yet, joining hands with them and getting along with them? That\u2019s an action that goes against the Church\u2019s ideals. That Karen-san there is taking the initiative of doing that even though she is in the position of being a hero, and not only has Yorishiro-sama not reprimanded her, I heard that you are actually endorsing it.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people inside the church that think of its well-being have all unanimously come to me to express their displeasure. If the current hero and the Founder have both stepped in the wrong path, they had no other person to rely on but me. And so, I had no choice but to appear before you like this.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThose two as well?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The gaze of Yorishiro was directed at the other former heroes, Kyouka and Sarasa. The two are trembling just like the time when the current heroes first met Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are talking about you here, so you must have thought that the more pawns the better and had them involved in this as well.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?! \u2026\u2026In that case, could it be that the notice telling us about the Hero Alliance was your doing, Ates?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Kyouka roars as she asks, but Ates didn\u2019t falter one bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about~.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>She simply smiled. How wicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you were more useless than I expected, and it proved that the heroes of the trash churches are, as I thought, trash as well.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes-sama!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san speaks out boldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said before, by having the heroes cooperate, we can manage to oppose the monsters in a more effective way! That way we can protect even more people\u2014!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, that very thinking of yours is incorrect.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates says cold-heartedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heroes protect is the Church\u2019s authority.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy having the people be saved by the hero, they will respect and light up their religious belief towards the Church that the hero is affiliated to. The hero fights for that sake. What you say is the very definition of mistaking the method and objective.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2014!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cA group is often a brittle thing. There are times when it would easily crumble by losing their old conventions, their authority. Karen-san, what you are trying to do holds the danger of ending the Light Church. Do you properly understand that?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Being gazed straight by Ates, Karen-san was unable to say anything back.</p><br/><p>As I thought, even for Karen-san, the former hero is also a natural enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people that you say must be protected, they are able to live in peace thanks to the church. Is creating chaos in society with your narrow perspective also a duty of a hero? It looks like you have absolutely no self-consciousness that you are hero. Isn\u2019t that right, Yorishiro-sama?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Being directed a disgusting gaze, Yorishiro speaks indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes-san and the others, I understand now that you are displeased with the measures of the current churches. It is obvious that change invites opposition. The previous heroes being the ones taking the forefront in the old conventions\u2019 side might, in a way, be inevitable.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Meaning that the old conventions are chanted by the past people huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this should be the best opportunity. Whether it is a person or an organization, it is impossible to continue concentrating forever in one thing. The time will come when the old ones that don\u2019t fit the requirements of the era must be replaced for the new. This is the moment for that.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you saying this is the best opportunity to prove that?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd how will you be proving that?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>As if they already knew what the both of them would be saying from the very beginning, the conversation continued smoothly, and Yorishiro spoke the conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, by fighting.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><ul><li>179: Beginning of battle</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cDividing the teams into current heroes and previous heroes, we will be having a match. How about \u2018the one who wins will have their opinion pass\u2019?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201dEeeeehhh?!!!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201dEeeeh?!!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>The current hero and previous hero teams were shocked by it. The only one who was calm about it was Ates.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unexpected. Yorishiro-sama, who would always make careful preparations in order to achieve her objective, has decided on such an impulsive match like this.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones who win at the end are not the ones who don\u2019t neglect preparation, but the ones who can adapt to the flow.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever. But why did you make it a team fight? If we are to put an end to all this in a match, shouldn\u2019t it be enough with a one on one fight with Karen-san and me?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Karen-san who was standing at my side had her shoulders quiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. The Hero Alliance has the approval of all the five current Founders of the Churches. If you want to cancel the Hero Alliance, you will have to convince them all.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I am saying that\u2019s being domesticated though. Kyouka-san, Sarasa-san, that\u2019s how things are. What are you going to do?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201dEek?!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Being suddenly called, the previous fire and water heroes get surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t really mind, you know. I can easily wring the neck of these greenhorns by myself after all. If you two are scared of fighting with your already dulled arms, you can go to the spectators seat and tremble there obediently.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get conceited, wicked hero! Leaving aside the other half-assed bunch, my pupil Mirack is not one to so easily fall! If I don\u2019t take the stage, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do jack-shit! If it\u2019s a battle, I will be rampaging!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to accept the challenges that are being sold to me, or I would be a disgrace of a Hydra Ville merchant. This is a good chance to confirm if Celestis-san has dulled with all that playing around as an idol.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Mirack and Celestis stiffened their faces and went \u2018Uwaaa~\u2019 at that.</p><br/><p>But those former fire and water heroes, aren\u2019t they being controlled skilfully by that wicked light hero?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, now that the talk has been wrapped up, I will have you let me stay here for today. Whichever the case, there\u2019s the need for time and preparation in order to make that fight an official one. Isn\u2019t that right, Yorishiro-sama?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. We will be telling you the time and place when it is done.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Once again sparks flew around, and the face off of Yorishiro and Ates finished.</p><br/><p>Before leaving the room, Ates stops her steps in front of Karen.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, that\u2019s how things have ended up as. Let\u2019s fight with all we have in the designated date.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Uhm\u2014!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that you are not worthy of being the light hero. I plan on proving that in this fight.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Ates left the room this time for sure.</p><br/><p>Kyouka and Sarasa followed fit.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe prepared, Mirack. That lukewarm tenacity of yours, I will be beating it down at that day until it turns into shape!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also be taking my leave here, Celestis-san. In order to, at the very least, not make it an embarrassing defeat, cancel all your idol plans and concentrate on training.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Is what they said as they left.</p><br/><p>Seeing them off, the current heroes Mirack and Celestis reacted by saying\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSis was oozing the aura of a small fry!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were poured the pressure of Yorishiro-sama and the former light hero after all. Are you saying that the previous heroes were so whipped when dealing with the Light Church?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Even so, I think that Mirack and Celestis are also being smoothly dealt with by Karen-san, in the good sense of the way, or at least that\u2019s what I want to believe is how it is.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And so?\u201d</p><br/><p>The storm passed and we are now in the parlor room of the Light Grand Church.</p><br/><p>Now that the previous heroes have left, the amount of people has finally lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe weakling smell has gotten thinner and it is finally easier to breath.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sudden jump in the average age of this place has finally stabilized to normal numbers.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack and Celestis go \u2018fuhihi\u2019 as they laugh.</p><br/><p>Was the pressure and stress from their senpai\u2019s really that much? But it looks like even the outsider also felt it. The wind hero Hyue who was trying to join the conversation said\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, that was tensing. I couldn\u2019t keep up with the conversation and, in the middle of it, I turned into air.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a wind hero.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a wind hero.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Truly a wind hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what are we going to do about this? Isn\u2019t a match a bit too much all of a sudden?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>While I was cleaning up the wreckage that was left when the former heroes destroyed the wall, I reprimand Yorishiro regarding the duel.</p><br/><p>That Yorishiro was nonchalantly drinking tea.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This is an event that I predicted.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe five churches have been at their throats for a long time. At the time when the churches were established, they stole many worshippers from each other in order to offer as much prayers as possible to their Gods, and there was even a period when churches were at war. Since the appearance of monsters and ethereal, the fighting had drawn back in the surface, but even with that, there hasn\u2019t been a single moment where the churches have gotten along with each other.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that is about to change, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Thanks to the effort of these young heroes here, the relationship between the churches is rapidly increasing favorably. It is also due to the fact that we have mutual enemies that are the Mother Monsters and the Demon Lords, but all churches uniting as one has not occurred even once in all of history.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s exactly why\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will always be people who will go against something that has no precedent. The heroes are the face of the church. It is hard to ignore that influence even for the people that have already retired. Knowing that the ones that have caused this change were the current heroes, they have no choice but to have the former heroes shoulder the responsibility of stopping it.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>That means there\u2019s someone pulling the strings in the shadows?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, this is not simply a fight to see who is in the right but\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cA pure political conflict.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>And in reality, even if we were to only look at the Light Church, there\u2019s the Cardinal, Archbishop, and the Aurora Knights\u2019 General and also several other high-ranked knights. Due to them being born in a good family, they have obtained high positions.</p><br/><p>If the five churches cooperate and the fight against the monsters seriously begins, just by requiring them to show their abilities in a situation that needs them to, it would trouble them heavily.</p><br/><p>If we change to a new system, the dissatisfactions of the people that have gotten used to the old system would be many.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have begun a fight to eradicate monsters. For the sake of that, we will be joining hands with the heroes that have been enemies until now, and that will better the situation between churches. By doing something we have not been able to accomplish before, we have made a big step.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Okay?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, the future prospects are bleak. The existence that has been born from the Mother Monster, the Demon Lord. To identify the identity of that, we have gathered the strength of all churches, but there have been no tangible results yet. In the middle of that, a problem appeared, not in the monster related side but in the human side.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Thanks for explaining the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to use this opportunity to bring out to light all the ones who are against this change.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah, could it be that that was why Yorishiro-sama challenged the former heroes to a match?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro nods at the question of Celestis.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The puppeteers in this occasion will use many means in order to have the previous heroes win. The ones who move are enemies. They are the insects that are squirming inside us\u2026 Everyone\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cY-Yes?!\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201c-Dasu!\u201d</p><br/><p>The current heroes tremble in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstand that this is a fight we can\u2019t avoid. By winning this, proof that you are in the right. I will find every single enemy that is lurking in the shadows. By overcoming this difficulty, we will do one more step towards peace!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-176-177-returning-leaders\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 176-177 - Returning leaders\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-180-181-enquiry-about-the-previous-generation\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 180-181 - Enquiry about the previous generation\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236320\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Why are you saying that?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The newbie as a God -Karen- also raised her tone with a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery one of you guys have a variety of grudges towards each other. I am also aware of this. But after overcoming the trials and tribulations until now, humans and Gods should have been able to reconcile, right?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>At the far past, at the beginning of the world, Gods could only see humans as slaves that should obey them.</p><br/><p>Aside from me.</p><br/><p>But after a long long passing of time, humans have grown, developed, and that greatness has begun to be acknowledged by even the Gods.</p><br/><p>The Gods that had looked down on the humans all the time are now accepting the humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, humans and Gods can finally advance together in a normal relationship. And yet, Gods are disappearing and leaving humans?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the contrary, new Light Goddess.\u201d (Quasar)</p><br/><p>Shiva\u2026no, the Wind God Quasar spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans have grown in a strong and splendid manner. That\u2019s why humans don\u2019t need Gods anymore.\u201d (Quasar)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn reality, we should have done this sooner. The role of us Gods is to create a world, and the moment we did that, our role was over\u2026\u2026keh.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>(Slovenly living our time in a world where we have nothing to do; we Gods are simply troublemakers for the true protagonists of this world, the humans.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so as well~\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>The four Base Elements were all giving their own opinions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe humans already have enough strength to stand on their own two feet. The Demon Lord battle was the best example of it.\u201d (Quasar)</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans bursted right through it and managed to overcome that battle splendidly. There was no need for us Gods to protect you, or save you\u2026\u2026keh.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>As if Karen-san couldn\u2019t take it anymore, she intervened.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that was because you Gods provided us with the strength of a God Hero\u2014!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>(It doesn\u2019t change the fact that you guys were the ones who personally fought.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. That was clearly the victory of humans.</p><br/><p>For us Gods who created humans and believed in them, there\u2019s no better pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we are going to stop any extra interference, and decided on leaving the world. Before I incarnated to this body of Shiva, I have been living as a human many times, and each time I did, I was able to experience something new that I didn\u2019t experience before.\u201d (Quasar)</p><br/><p>Quasar smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it is time to put an end to it. I will be separating from always being in the care of a linked body and also the people of the Wind nation. They have to continue forward on their own strength. Looking at the child I had with Juo, I think about this more and more.\u201d (Quasar)</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter leaving this world\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro joins.</p><br/><p>As one of the highest within the Gods, she is in a standing that allows her to decide.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you plan on doing?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>(Right, that\u2019s what it is.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>Nova says with rough breathing from his cow body.</p><br/><p>(How about creating a new world?) (Nova)</p><br/><p>A new world?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe role of us Gods is to create worlds to begin with. You could say the people here have developed and this world is a great success. With that success in mind, how about challenging for the next one? Is what we are thinking\u2026keh.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think that~.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>Mantle is adding agreement here and there as it goes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in the end, we four Base Elements can\u2019t create worlds with just us. The foundation of the world -time and space- can only be created by the Light and Darkness Gods.\u201d (Quasar)</p><br/><p>(And so, how about leaving this world together with us and creating a new world?) (Nova)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a lot of past grudges between us, but how about letting it be water under the bridge?\u2026Keh.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too~.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>I was bewildered by this, and so, I looked at Yorishiro and Karen-san.</p><br/><p>Their eyes had no hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Right. We are not the ones who have the answer.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The one who has the answer is this world itself.</p><br/><p>This world has developed and evolved. If this world has arrived to the answer of not needing the protection of us Gods anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014We Gods have to accept that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans believe in Gods; but more than that, Gods believe in humans. That\u2019s what I felt the most in the passing of 1,600 years.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026But, Haine-san\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro pulled my sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are currently not only Gods, but also humans.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Right now, we are Haine-san, Yorishiro-sama, and Karen. We won\u2019t leave this world until we fulfill that role as humans, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The two beauties are looking at me with uneasiness in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026Of course.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will enjoy my life as Kuromiya Haine to the fullest. For us Gods, the whole life of a human is like the blink of an eye. Let\u2019s live it to the utmost!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yeah. I have no intentions of leaving this world until I watch over Hyue marrying, my child splendidly growing up, and growing old together with Juo!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>(I gotta look after the pro-wrestling enterprise of Mirack for a little bit more.) (Phalaris)</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter we leave, I am thinking of leaving the supervision of things to the Demon Lord-sans. I am sure they will become splendid guardians of the world\u2026keh.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too~.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>Mantle, at least try to say something for yourself at the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, it has been decided.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>After living through our life to the fullest, we will aim for the next world.</p><br/><p>Just like in this world.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s make another wonderful world.</p><br/><p>Karen-san, Mirack, Celestis, Sasae-chan, Hyue; and also the many people we have met until now\u2026</p><br/><p>This world is\u2026truly a wonderful world.</p><ul><li>422: An endless story</li></ul><br/><p>After that, even more time passed on.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s not a single one left in that world that knows about that gathering.</p><br/><p>Some had their soul leave their dying bodies, some were given new duties from the Gods as they left the world.</p><br/><p>Even with that, the world continues uninterrupted.</p><br/><p>The miracle that they had made possible in the past has now turned into a legend and has been passed down by many people.</p><br/><p>As Kuromiya Haine, Yorishiro, and Kourin Karen; we who have finished our roles and had come out from our bodies, had now returned to being Gods, and were leaving on a journey to look for a new role.</p><br/><p>Now then, next will be\u2026</p><br/><p>What kind of world shall we make?</p><br/><p>\u2014World Reformation activities of the Dark God, The End</p></div></header><br/>\n</p></div>"}

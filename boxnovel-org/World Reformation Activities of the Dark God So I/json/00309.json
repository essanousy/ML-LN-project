Thanks for the support! </p><br/><p>Sponsored Chapters</p><hr/><br/><p>I -Kuromiya Haine- and the group are still in the middle of saving Mother Earth Mantle.</p><br/><p>Or more like, it was supposed to be a simple mission where once we manage to do it once, it will be over, but because that once doesn\u2019t happen at all, we are facing a long trek.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Yorishiro and Shiva, who are together with me in this mission, were silent.</p><br/><p>This situation where, no matter how many times we try, there\u2019s no progress. Even our hearts were exhausted.</p><br/><p>This place is the danger zone that no one steps into, the Nameless Desert.</p><br/><p>Inside the black hole that has been placed at the depths of this desert, Mantle is sealed, or so we think. In terms of probability, it could be that even her soul has been crushed by the gravity of the black hole, or maybe she was thrown into a different world from the warped space created there. Those possibilities are present as well.</p><br/><p>We are betting on the possibility that Mantle can return to this world.</p><br/><p>And so, by using the only element that can go against the dark element, we are trying to shoot through the core of the Black Hole, but\u2026how many times has it been already?</p><br/><p>A hundred? A thousand?</p><br/><p>Yorishiro was shooting the light divine power and Shiva and I were doing the support to make it so that it hits the target, but it isn\u2019t going well at all.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the more compressed the core is, the higher the gravity, is how the Black Hole works. That\u2019s why the size of the core is one hundredth the size of a grain of sand.</p><br/><p>Just that one point makes it close to impossible to shoot at it, and yet, because the surroundings of the Black Hole don\u2019t even allow the reflection of light, we don\u2019t know exactly where the core is.</p><br/><p>Even with the accuracy of Shiva who has mastered the wind gun technique, we can\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh geez, another failure.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>After thousands of test fires turning out in fruitless effort, Yorishiro lets out a sigh as if she was already tired of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy whole body is sticky with sweat and sand\u2026 Hey, how about we move to the oasis and have a break? I want to dip in water and get refreshed-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain?! Didn\u2019t we have a break just a few moments ago?!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Due to piling failure after failure, everyone\u2019s heart was in shambles and were irritable.</p><br/><p>The normally bad relationship of Shiva and Yorishiro was even worse right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe body of a woman is delicate. We are in such a harsh environment, and that\u2019s exactly why there\u2019s the need to take the proper care! Ah geez! Who was the one that left the Black Hole in such a damn hot desert?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro is snapping in a way different from usual?!</p><br/><p>This is proof that she is being quite mentally cornered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, Shiva! If you weren\u2019t here, Haine-san and I would be all alone and we would be able to bath in the water and go kyakyafufu! But thanks to you, it has been divided into male and female! You are in the way! Why are you here?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people told me to come together! I as well don\u2019t want to see your naked body anyways! If it is mixed bathing, I would prefer doing it with Juo!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>No good! Because of the heat, the two are getting irritated?!</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t want to make our time here pointless, so we have endured until now, but we have to put an end to this soon!</p><br/><p>The rescue of Mantle is impossible, we should give up.</p><br/><p>The problem of the Demon Lords can\u2019t be put aside, so we can\u2019t waste anymore time.</p><br/><p>It would be best to return as soon as possible and prepare to go against the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>Was our choice of saving Mantle mistaken from the very beginning?</p><br/><p>(Hmph, those are bad faces you got there, you people.)</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone is doing their best in trying to save Mantle, so it can\u2019t be helped that they are tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?!</p><br/><p>In this Nameless Desert where there shouldn\u2019t be anyone but us, we heard voices.</p><br/><p>We turned around to see what it was, and there, two monsters were lined up.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhalaris! And also\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I think I have seen him before. That humanoid water living being kind of impression this monster gives off\u2026Water Demon, Mephistopheles.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that the body Coacervate used in the surface world?!</p><br/><p>Then the reason it is here now must mean\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cCoacervate and Nova huh!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Within the six Gods of Creation, they were the central figures against the humans. Why are they here?!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, I will be having you see your last moments here.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>(Gaaah!! Unhand me, unhand meee!!)</p><br/><p>Inside the hand of Mephistopheles, there\u2019s a single lizard struggling.</p><br/><p>The soul voice coming from that lizard is without doubt that of Coacervate.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s two Coacervates?</p><br/><p>What is the meaning of this?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe polluted me, that abyss that is spreading in front of us is the most fitting as your grave.\u201d (Coacervatwo)</p><br/><p>(D-Don\u2019t tell me, you bastard\u2026! Stop it! Why are you doing such a horrible thing?! I am you, you know?!) (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou who refused your bond with humans are already not a God. And so, you don\u2019t share the same title as Water God. Evil spirits are supposed to be exorcised.\u201d (Coacervatwo)</p><br/><p>(STOOOOP!!) (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>Without caring about the lizard\u2019s desperate struggle, Mephistopheles positioned in pitching form and threw the lizard\u2026directly at the Black Hole that absorbs everything.</p><br/><p>(Ugyaaaaa!!!)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, Inflation! Quasar! At the place where my polluted self is being crushed, there\u2019s the core of the Black Hole!!\u201d (Coacervatwo)</p><br/><p>Ah! I see!!</p><br/><p>A Black Hole doesn\u2019t allow light to reflect, but a soul is different. If it is to follow its destination, even we can follow it outside the Black Hole.</p><br/><p>The only way to investigate the inside of the Black Hole!</p><br/><p>\u201cShiva! Take position! There\u2019s only one chance!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cKugh, what\u2019s with this development!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva is confused, but I am as well, you know.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s no way I can let this chance slip by, so we both line up the wind and gravity lenses.</p><br/><p>(The polluted Coacervate has divided recently, so he is weakened! He doesn\u2019t have the strength to cling onto the Schwarzschild radius! In other words, his soul will surely be crushed by the center of the Black Hole!) (Nova)</p><br/><p>Even Nova gave out advise!</p><br/><p>What in the world is happening?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAim for that moment and\u2026 [Holy Light Line]!!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro shoots a light beam.</p><br/><p>This passed through the lens of Shiva and I, and with the angling of Shiva, it flies at the place where lizard Coacervate\u2019s soul was crushed.</p><br/><p>It entered the Black Hole and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>*GWOOOOON!*</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaaa!!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cDid we do it?!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>The Black Hole was destroyed.</p><br/><p>The core has been erased by the light divine power and all the light caught in the Schwarzschild radius was released all at once, dispersing everywhere.</p><br/><p>It was an overwhelming explosion.</p><br/><p>If this wasn\u2019t the Nameless Desert where there\u2019s nothing, this could have destroyed a town.</p><br/><p>By releasing all our God power, we were able to protect our body, but the gathered air from the gravity expanded heavily and created a big blast of wind.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>A big somewhat fluorescent woman came flying together with the blast. Her butt falls grandly onto the sand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that Mantle\u2019s fairy?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The temporary body of Mantle that she created to act in the surface world.</p><br/><p>She has returned!</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch ouch ouch\u2026 Eh? Why is everyone all gathered here?\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Being told this, we noticed once again the six gathered here.</p><br/><p>Dark God Entropy, Light Goddess Inflation, Wind God Quasar, Fire God Nova, Water God Coacervate, and the Mother Earth Mantle that came flying just now.</p><br/><p>This is something that I didn\u2019t expect at all but, could this be\u2026the first time after 1,600 years that all six Gods of Creation have gathered?!</p><ul><li>310: Six Gods reunite</li></ul><br/><p>To think something like this would happen.</p><br/><p>The six Gods that created this world have reunited at one place.</p><br/><p>This is the Nameless Desert. Unless you are feeling suicidal, no one would step into it. That\u2019s why this meeting of Gods had no fear of having interlopers.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.First of all, everyone, it has been a while.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Not knowing what to say, I did my best to give an opening greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that, but I have been meeting Haine-san frequently though.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the sense that these members are reunited. This is the first time since the Genesis Era.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s because a goody-two-shoes God has been sealed for 1,600 years!) (Nova)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now Entropy-san has come back and the friendship of the six Gods has also been revived. Isn\u2019t that a great thing?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, about that\u2026 Why is everyone gathered?\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Every single one of them were speaking their minds out. I honestly don\u2019t think I will be able to put these people in order.</p><br/><p>In the first place, these Gods -including me- were the ones who created this world.</p><br/><p>Creating space and time, in order to fill that space, air, water, and earth were created, and with fire, everything was melded together.</p><br/><p>The ones who did this were us Gods.</p><br/><p>Right after, because of a difference in opinions, we were divided in two sides and fought each other. One side was me Entropy, and all the others were on the other side.</p><br/><p>I was defeated in the battle of Gods and the winners sealed me.</p><br/><p>And so, after 1,600 years passed, the seal was broken and I incarnated as the human Kuromiya Haine.</p><br/><p>Now, we are here.</p><br/><p>The other five Gods were apparently doing whatever they pleased in my absence.</p><br/><p>Once I returned, as chances came by, I got to know of their deeds from hearsay, and there were times when I would be angry or impressed by them.</p><br/><p>But to think that there would be a time when we would all gather.</p><br/><p>Even if we had moments were we would see each other, the Gods don\u2019t get along by nature, so I thought it would be completely impossible for everyone to gather when called\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026by the way, what did you guys come here to do?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what to talk about, so I move the conversation to the cow and fishman that suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>It would be inconvenient not to have a body when acting in the surface world, so we Gods prepared a body when we descended.</p><br/><p>I -Entropy-, Inflation, and Quasar had incarnated as normal humans. We are acting in the world of humans with the standing of humans.</p><br/><p>But these other two Gods are different.</p><br/><p>Nova incarnated into the Fire Cow Phalaris; Water God Coacervate into the Water Demon Mephistopheles; both monster bodies.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why their looks are different from the rest and, even if we were to go back to why they incarnated as monsters, their way of thinking is simply too different from mine.</p><br/><p>We are in such an antagonistic relationship, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>(What we came here to do, you say?! \u2026Hmph, that goes the same for you people. What are you playing around here for?!) (Nova)</p><br/><p>Is what the cow Nova says as he bursts right at the beginning of our discussion.</p><br/><p>(The goody-two-shoes that claimed about protecting the humans were you people in the first place!! And yet, you don\u2019t do as you say, and are spacing out at such a remote place. In the time you weren\u2019t present, do you not know how much distress the cities of the humans faced?!) (Nova)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cNow now, don\u2019t be so angry. Entropy-san and the others were also doing their best.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>And the fishman tries to calm down the cow.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, maybe I should call you Haine-san right now. At any rate, in order to gather the God Heroes to go against the Demon Lords, they were challenging the harsh enterprise of bringing back Mantle-san that had disappeared into the depths of the Black Hole. I, Coacervate, am aware of their hard work.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Or more like\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uhm, Coacervate-san?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, it is I Coacervate. I have not met Haine-san since our quarrel at the Water capital.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>I unintentionally asked in a questioning tone at the end but, is it really Coacervate?</p><br/><p>The Coacervate I know is a vacillating and underhanded guy that loves doing things people hate; that kind of terrible guy though?</p><br/><p>It has been a while since we have met, and even when his incarnated body is that of a monster, it somehow gives out a divine feeling\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026that body, if I remember correctly, that\u2019s the one I destroyed before\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. This body was destroyed by Haine-san and I remade it, Mephistopheles MkII. But there have been a change of ways, and now, rather than Water Demon, it is Water Saint.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Water Saint?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t misunderstand. It is not as if I am calling myself a saint out of conceit.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>The fishman began to justify.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is actually the contrary. In the past, I called myself a God, and yet, because of the underhanded ways I employed that were far from this title, I have caused trouble to the people. Thinking of redeeming myself and to separate from my past self, I had this body shoulder the title of \u2018Saint\u2019. The title of Water Saint has the objective of becoming what\u2019s close to what humans think of as Saint, and to actually become one!!\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>The fishman seems to be getting heated up as he speaks.</p><br/><p>I was actually surprised by the honesty I could feel from that speech.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with this Water God? He has changed way too much from the last time I met him. What happened in the time I haven\u2019t seen him?!</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, could this possible be\u2026!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>And Shiva who was watching this seems to have an idea of this.</p><br/><p>(Yeah, in the past when we beat this guy up, something similar to this happened.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>It looks like Nova also knows something.</p><br/><p>Or more like, this guy appeared together with Coacervate, so there\u2019s no doubt he knows the answer itself.</p><br/><p>And so, from then on, we were told by the Fire and Water Gods about what happened while we were saving Mantle.</p><ul><li>311: God\u2019s Conference \u2013 Complete version</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cDistillation.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Something like that can happen?</p><br/><p>In other words, the Water God, when heated to a certain extent, he evaporates and becomes steam.</p><br/><p>By doing this, the many contaminated parts get separated?</p><br/><p>\u201cCoacervate is the God that is the most easily affected by the dirt of the humans and world.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Inflation speaks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because water washes away all filth that the impurities stay inside of it. Those impurities warp the personality and cause tons of pain to their surroundings. When creating the world, quite the amount of impurities were born, and he swallowed them all after all. He had been quite contaminated from the beginning.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it would have been impossible for me to know of the clean part of him since I was sealed right after the Creation huh.</p><br/><p>No matter what it is, everything creates filth when they are born or die.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Coacervate being in an evaporated state is quite rare. Isn\u2019t this the second time this has happened since the 1,600 years after the Genesis era?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>What? Only two?</p><br/><p>In that case, Coacervate has only been in this state once in the time I was sealed?</p><br/><p>(That was something that happened not long after our Churches were made.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>And the cow speaks.</p><br/><p>In other words, it was at the time when human civilization was beginning.</p><br/><p>(At that time, we were stealing away our believers and fighting each other. At that time, my Fire Church and Quasar\u2019s Wind Church were having an all-out battle.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd in all that, Coacervate had sent an oracle to the Water Church. They made a surprise attack to the Fire and Wind Church while we were in a battle. The surprise attack worked and my Wind army was practically wiped out.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Quasar grinds his teeth in anguish as he remembered those times.</p><br/><p>Truly a Coacervate-like way of doing things.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, I had incarnated as the Wind Founder, but since I was taking command of the army, I died along with many of my troops. Being liberated from my flesh, I returned to being Quasar. Pissed off, I challenged Coacervate to battle.\u201d (Quasar)</p><br/><p>(I was also pissed off, so I cooperated. With the wind increasing the strength of my flames, we boiled him continuously. He was evaporated, and this guy was came out.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly in debt for that time.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>Coacervate lowers his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, this served as a trigger for a big leap in the human civilization.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro points out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe distilled Coacervate did his very best to become a guardian working for the sake of humans and the Water Church developed heavily. The reason why the Water Church has a relatively free way of thinking that is not caught in the doctrine of the Church is most likely because of this.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut well, after a hundred years, I was contaminated again and absorbed into the polluted Coacervate though.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>(True.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>The Gods were talking about the past with nostalgia.</p><br/><p>Hearing this story, I closed my eyes for a moment and decided.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s burn this guy again after a hundred years!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>No, really.</p><br/><p>The Coacervate that plays around with humans is a big problem for the world.</p><br/><p>If we can deal with that at a regular basis, there\u2019s no reason not to.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue. In time, I will once again be contaminated and will cause trouble to my beloved humans and my brethren Gods. If it is in order to avoid this, I am more than willing to burn in the flames of hell. Actually, that\u2019s what I want!!\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>The fresh water God that had been separated from his filth was speaking in an admirable manner and made me surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, about that\u2026!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is easier said than done!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Shiva and Yorishiro warn.</p><br/><p>I thought it was a great proposal though?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Originally, when my body is evaporated, it will normally return to my God core. That\u2019s why, no matter how much I get evaporated, if it returns to a contaminated core, I will simply return to being the polluted Coacervate.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Then why were you able to split into filth and distilled this time and in the past?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>(Because he had a place that could become his new core.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>\u201cA place that could become his new core?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>(The human prayers.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>The cow is dragging the explanation.</p><br/><p>(Humans pray to their God. Within those prayers, in order to direct their prayers to a God they have not seen, they create a figure of their own. The figure that is shaped within the hearts of humans, when the steam converges into it, the distilled Coacervate is born.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means the prayers towards Gods possesses quite the power if they are able to do a feat like that. Several hundreds of years ago, at the time when the Churches were just being made, the prayers were abundant to the point that it could serve as the core to his body.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this time around, my hero Celestis didn\u2019t lose to the doubts and despair, and continued loving me as her God, so that love had gathered my vaporized self. I am truly fortunate to have a hero like that.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>But I see. Simply burning Coacervate and having him evaporate is not enough huh.</p><br/><p>It is not only the Gods that affect humans, humans also affect Gods. I feel like this is a good example of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether it was a coincidence or an inevitability, I was able to separate from my polluted self and become distilled. Now that I am here, I will fulfill my original duty as a God and will cooperate with everyone to protect the humans and the world.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Okay.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>(Ah, yes.) (Nova)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it fine?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is disgusting-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Only Yorishiro didn\u2019t hide her opinion.</p><br/><p>But the most difficult one to convince, Coacervate, has joined forces with us.

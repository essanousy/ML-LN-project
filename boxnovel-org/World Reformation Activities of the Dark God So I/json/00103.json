Well, that makes it feel as if we are pals now, so it makes me happy though.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan at times nonchalantly says embarrassing things.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! Until now, the only one that Karen could speak so casually with was me!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should leave it at that, or people will begin calling you lesbian, you know?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>At any rate, I\u2026I want to help Haine-san who has gone to defeat the Mother Monsters.</p><br/><p>But I don\u2019t know where Haine-san went. That\u2019s the problem.</p><br/><p>I should have tried asking Yorishiro-sama when she was here.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-chi as well, how about not getting so worked up and just give it up this time around? It is not like this is your only chance to do go with him anyways.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, Karen. The duty of us heroes is to protect the people. Shouldn\u2019t you think of it as Haine-san being able to leave without worries thanks to you fortifying the defenses of Apollon City?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThose words you said just now, I wish I could have recorded it to send to the people of the Fire Church.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The two of them are kind.</p><br/><p>Right, Haine-san will be returning after a few days anyways.</p><br/><p>In that case, I should act as a faithful wife that waits for the return of her husband. Let\u2019s proceed with the other things that should be done.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, there\u2019s actually another thing I would like to consult you two about\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The two of them casually get ready to listen. So kind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to form a hero alliance!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The reaction of the two was similar.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero Alliance?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It looks like they haven\u2019t digested the meaning of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, the heroes have been acting separately, right? Shouldering their respective Church on their back, and at times, quarreling with each other. But lately, because of a lot of things occurring, we have been reaching compromises, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mostly the deed of one specific person though.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, little by little, we have begun getting along.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Being able to have tea and speaking with each other like this is, in a sense, a sign of progress in itself. And by pushing it even further\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this occasion, I want to expand the circle of cooperation between heroes. In other words, I want to create a cooperative structure with us light, fire, water heroes, and also the earth and wind heroes!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the Hero Alliance.</p><br/><p>Even if we are to help Haine-san\u2019s plan in defeating the Mother Monsters, it would be better to have more allies.</p><br/><p>Now that there are more than half of the heroes in this side, this is the best opportunity to give shape to a cooperative structure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. If it\u2019s something that Karen-san wants, I have no objections.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that fine. If we manage to defeat those so called Mother Monsters, no doubt we would be heroes that carved their names in history. Increasing our allies as preparation for it, I think it is fine. I want results, but I don\u2019t like risks after all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Ooh, the two are more into it than I thought!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I would like to contact the earth and wind hero! Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan, have you met them?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Uwa\u2026</p><br/><p>We suddenly fell into a pit already.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one here is acquainted with the earth or the wind hero?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat way of putting it must mean that Karen-chi also isn\u2019t acquainted with them huh. But, it can\u2019t be helped, right? To begin with, the place where the Earth Church\u2019s headquarter is located, Ishtar Blaze, is crazy far and a national isolation has formed naturally. It seems the Church itself has not had contact for several years as well.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t even know where the Wind capital Rudra State, where the Wind Church\u2019s headquarters is, is located.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>It is just as Celestis-chan and Mirack-chan explained.</p><br/><p>The Wind Church is specially secretive, and their activities are strictly hidden. It is that type of doctrine. Because of this, the location of Rudra State has not been revealed, and there\u2019s even scary rumors that say people who have tried to reveal it have died unnatural deaths. The wind hero that protects this Wind capital has also been shrouded in mystery for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaving aside wind, as long as we have the resolve to travel a long distance, it is possible to meet the earth hero, but even with a flying machine, it will still be a journey that will take several days, you know.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cTotally a no then. If we were to leave to somewhere so faraway, in the moments where a big monster were to attack our city, we wouldn\u2019t be able to assist. Thanks to the flying machines, we heroes have gained quite the freedom in movement, but there\u2019s limits to that.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Groaning with an \u2018ueee\u2019, the upper-half of my body falls onto the table.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with this. Everything that I have thought of has been falling into pits one after the other.</p><br/><p>We don\u2019t know where Haine-san has gone to, so there\u2019s no way we can chase after him, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any hope in meeting the earth and wind heroes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. There\u2019s no real need for all three of us to go, right? In the time one of us goes to Ishtar Blaze, the other two can assist in protecting that person\u2019s base.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Church wouldn\u2019t allow that. As I have been saying over and over, the hero has to protect their own base.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I once again groan with an \u2018ueeee\u2019.</p><br/><p>So we have reached a dead end.</p><br/><p>Just when I was thinking about ending this meeting as just a tea party where we simply feasted on cake\u2026</p><br/><p>A knocking sound reverberated in the parlor room we were relaxing in.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon the intrusion. Is the hero, Karen-sama, here\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who entered the room was Captain Vesage.</p><br/><p>A knight of our Aurora Knight Corps, and a Captain at that, so he is reasonably important.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Who is this?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cCould this be those so called light knights of the Light Church?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan showed interest in Captain Vesage.</p><br/><p>In this scenario, I should be introducing them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person here is one of the members of the Aurora Knight Corps, Captain Vesage. And Captain Vesage, you know the people here, right? The fire hero, Katack Mirack; and the water hero\u2014\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles-taaaaaaaan?!!!\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>Eh? What?!</p><br/><p>Captain Vesage fell on his knees the moment he saw Celestis-chan?!</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! What\u2019s this?! Is he the type that overreacts as a punchline?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan was also bewildered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, isn\u2019t it that? The one in command when Haine-san was doing that idol hunting thing.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>With the remark of Mirack-chan, I remember that something like that did happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to restrain the idol proselytizing of Celestis, they would go to the houses of the metropolitan area, and confiscated all idol goods found. As they got in touch with those items, they were slowly infected as well, and by the time they noticed, they had become fans of Celestis themselves.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, if you are my fan, just say so. It is rare to meet fans of mine outside the Water capital, so I am super happy about it. How about I splurge a bit here and give you an autograph?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cStop i~t! Don\u2019t tempt me! But, thank you very much! Thank you very much! To think there would be a day where the picture frame I bought would be of use!\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>\u2026I didn\u2019t know Captain Vesage was this kind of person\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s fine. All people have an unexpected side to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, Captain Vesage, did you have business here? Could it be that monsters have appeared?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaa~! I have obtained a heirloom! I am happier than the time I was promoted to captain!! \u2014I mean, excuse me for that, Karen-sama. It is not that big of a matter, but I was searching for assistant Haine, you see. I was wondering if his direct superior, Karen-sama, would know of his whereabouts.\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>\u2026Haine-san has become quite the popular one.</p><br/><p>But too bad. Haine-san is absent. Hmph hmph.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, did you need something from Haine-san? He is unfortunately absent at the moment. If you are okay with me substituting him, can I ask what\u2019s the issue?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cTroubling hero-sama in a small matter like this is unthinkable! It is just that, there\u2019s a report stating that there have been sightings of a suspicious individual walking around the Light metropolitan area, and we wanted the help of assistant Haine to investigate this matter.\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>\u201cA suspicious individual?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. According to the report, \u2018a girl that is shouldering a scythe bigger than her own height is walking around the city\u2019.\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>That is indeed a suspicious individual.</p><ul><li>104: Capture</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cA scythe bigger than her own height?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, she is shouldering it? What\u2019s with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan, who were together with us, naturally ended up hearing the conversation as well, and furrowed their brows at the weirdness of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026hah\u2026 Celes-tan in the flesh. Hah\u2026 hah\u2026\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, Captain-san?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry about that, water hero-dono! Though, I have simply received the report and don\u2019t know the details of it. We were thinking of gathering members to head to the location in question.\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>A giant scythe huh.</p><br/><p>As a weapon, it is on the rare side, but it is true that shouldering something like that and walking in the middle of the city would be dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you were thinking of adding Haine-san to those members?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It might be unpleasant for Karen-sama to lend your direct subordinate, but I think that there\u2019s the need for assistant Haine\u2019s help in this.\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? W-Why?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a loli that is shouldering a giant scythe like the ones used to hunt down lives, you know? No matter how you think about it, this is definitely the job of a straight man to retort to. And when you talk about retorts, it is of course our church assistant, Haine.\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>That statement of yours in itself is worth retorting though.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so that\u2019s how it is.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree. I agree completely.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan and Mirack-chan agree to that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But Haine-san is currently out because of a task and is not in the Light capital at the moment. This is a problem. If we talk about a person that has retort power on the level of Haine-san, it would be\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>In a corner of my heart, I was thinking \u2018What the hell am I even saying?\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one right here.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Is what Mirack-chan says as she places a hand on the shoulder of the water hero, Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Stop that. Are you trying to turn me into a straight man character?! An idol is the opposite of that, a profession that teases! And you are telling me that I am a straight man\u2026the role of being teased? In order to survive the entertainment world, this is a technique that I have to refine for my incoming inauguration day. The most important stance as a professional! \u2026Okay, let\u2019s go.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan seems to be proactive about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles-tan in the flesh will be descending in this day to our Apollon City?! \u2026\u2026..No no, that\u2019s not the issue here. No matter how you put it, isn\u2019t this bad?! Troubling the hand of a foreign hero to assist in the territory of the Light Church is just\u2026!\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>Captain Vesage had a point.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-chan, I will be going. The Light Church should be the one dealing with the incidents that occur in Apollon City. In this time when Haine-san is absent, I as the hero have to work hard for his share as well!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, will you be okay? No matter how I see it, you are more like the type that receives the retorts, right?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, the airheaded type.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>Am I being seen in such a way?</p><br/><p>****</p><br/><p>And so, the tea party between heroes was temporarily suspended.</p><br/><p>We are now in the metropolitan area of Apollon City.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan came along with us\u2026 You could have stayed in the room.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying! Karen, if you are going to be heading out to a fight, then I can\u2019t just relax about! If there\u2019s the chance, I will save you from crisis and gain points!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, that suspicious individual has piqued my curiosity. Why is she shouldering a giant scythe? I feel like I won\u2019t be able to sleep tonight unless I hear of the reason clearly.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The two of them are so carefree.</p><br/><p>But it is true that this is a matter that feels like we can take it more at ease than fighting monsters. Can\u2019t lower my guard though. Let\u2019s catch that suspicious person quickly and return to our tea party.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, now that we are searching\u2026where should we tackle first?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>We have divided in groups with Captain Vesage to cover more ground, but for now, we haven\u2019t even seen a shadow of where she could be.</p><br/><p>According to the information, she should stick out like a sore thumb, so I was expecting we would find her immediately but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Karen.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it that?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>As expected, we easily found her.</p><br/><p>There she is, that\u2019s certainly her. At the place where Mirack-chan is pointing, there\u2019s a scythe.</p><br/><p>When I saw it at first, I thought that it was a scythe walking on its own. But that\u2019s not it. There\u2019s a small girl carrying that giant scythe at its base.</p><br/><p>Her age should be around 12-13 years old. She is a lot younger than us. And her body build is small. That\u2019s why, the giant scythe that would normally be held by a large build man had so much left over when held by such a small body. Her every step while shouldering that thing is dangerous.</p><br/><p>Staggering to the right, staggering to the left; just holding it makes it a dangerous weapon, and the people in the surroundings are scared off their wits.</p><br/><p>Looks like we have to hurry and secure her.</p><br/><p>When I was about to approach her\u2026 the sound of a big bell resounded.</p><br/><p>It was the bell of the clock tower that informed of the time.</p><br/><p>It is a tall building in the main street of Apollon City, and it has a big clock that can be seen even from afar. A bell tower that rings at a specific time.</p><br/><p>The architecture of the building is already a few decades old, and its design has charm, so it has become one of the sightseeing spots of Apollon City.</p><br/><p>The clock tower was emitting a *gon, gon, gon, gon* sound, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHiwawawawawawa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The scythe girl reacted excessively at it.</p><br/><p>She grew flustered, lost her wits, and the scythe that was already dangerous just by holding it, was now shaking heavily to the sides.</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out!!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the heroes reacted to this.</p><br/><p>The fastest one was the water hero, Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Water Bag]!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The water stream that was released from Miki Moses coiled around the scythe girl like a snake and envelops her.</p><br/><p>It was a feat that can only done with high control of water divine power.</p><br/><p>By imprisoning the scythe girl inside a cell of water, we eliminate the damage it might cause.</p><br/><p>Is what I thought but\u2026</p><br/><p>*Pang*!</p><br/><p>With a single swing of the scythe, the water prison was broken and became small droplets.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan was shocked by how her own technique was broken.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy \u2018Water Bag\u2019 was destroyed?! Could it be\u2026earth divine power?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>In that time, Mirack-chan and I didn\u2019t stop our legs.</p><br/><p>The preemptive strike of Celestis-chan was broken, but it served as an effective diversion, and we succeeded in getting a pincer attack on her.</p><br/><p>The holy sword, Saint-George, and the fire knuckles, Barbarossa, pressure the scythe girl from both sides.</p><br/><p>Yeah, it was good timing.</p><br/><p>We may bicker a lot, but the team coordination of us three has gotten better.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. If you get violent here, you will be immediately shot with fire and light divine power.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for being rough with you here. But having you wielding such a dangerous thing in the middle of the city is troubling.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Will the girl be obedient?</p><br/><p>After remonstrating her, we waited for the other side\u2019s reaction, and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the girl apologizes, she began to cry a river.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaa~n! Ah\u2019m sorry! I just got scared with th\u2019 sudden big sound-dasu! In mah village, th\u2019 only time a big sound like that be made is when the fields be catching fire-dasu yo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cE~h?!\u201d \u201cW-What\u2019s going on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and I were both surprised by this disgraceful behaviour.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suddenly got attacked-dasu! Scary! The city be seriously scary-dasu yo! So country bumpkins be getting their heads chopped off-dasu ka yo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said this, we tried to soothe her, and the name we somehow got was\u2026</p><br/><p>Gonbee Sasae.</p><br/><p>The earth hero that was dispatched by the Earth Church in Ishtar Blaze.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-100-102-heroes-assemble\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 100-102 - Heroes assemble\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-105-107-small-hero\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 105-107 - Small hero\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236288\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Don\u2019t lose!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>While we were using our combined strength to release dark matter, we were hoping for the turnaround from Hyue-chan.</p><br/><p>Dark matter would normally require the release of our five elements.</p><br/><p>Without Hyue-chan and just a temporary source that is continuously dissipating on its own, we won\u2019t be able to maintain it for long.</p><br/><p>But if we stand ground here, we can restrain Lucifer, and it can help out Hyue-chan.</p><br/><p>We are still helping each other out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your best, Hyue-chan!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan pulls the bolt of En No Ozuno, and sends a bullet into the chamber.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>And then, the shot is made, sending out sparks around it.</p><br/><p>The bullet that was shot made a direct hit onto Lucifer\u2019s back, more accurately speaking, close to where the wind wings are.</p><br/><p>The bullet digged deeply there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Are you an idiot?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates was simply ridiculing that action of hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe giant body of Lucifer receiving a single pea shot of yours; just what would it bring about even if it were to hit? Humans really like useless things huh. I can\u2019t play along with all your games, so please just stop the useless struggle.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan laughs boldly.</p><br/><p>Ates still hadn\u2019t realized. But we were able to notice the abnormality.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?! Right now, Hyue just\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, she certainly did\u2026!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>She shot a real bullet, didn\u2019t she?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wind Long Gun is a weapon that shoots wind bullets mixed with divine power. Because it is air, it won\u2019t ever run out of bullets. Even though that\u2019s the strong point of the weapon\u2026!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan deliberately shot an actual bullet.</p><br/><p>In other words, that bullet must have something special.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt may be vexing, but my sister-in-law Juo is the best scientist in the Wind Church.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of her work in creating Kukulkan, I am heavily indebted to her, but immediately after, I have already put a debt of equal weight on top of it. When we were retrieving the remains of Kukulkan, Juo retrieved a certain something as well.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Could she be talking about\u2026the armor of the gone Wind Demon Lord Raphael?</p><br/><p>\u201cI will say it once again. My sister-in-law is the best scientist. She detected the feeble remaining divine power inside the armor, and found a swarm of insects that were maintaining their life in a dormant state. She said they were his remains that barely managed to survive.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What is it you are trying to say here?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe remains that should have disappeared if left alone, Aniue-sama shared his own divine power to him and resurrected it. Juo created a cultivation device for his exclusive us and concentrated in maintaining his living functions. And that small handful of cells we somehow managed to resurrect, I have shot them in the bullet just now!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what was the actual bullet just now?!</p><br/><p>It is currently dug inside the body of Lucifer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was apparently a method they thought of after observing the fight of Haine-dono and the Demon Lords against Lucifer. Lucifer\u2019s body has his stolen wings. They are supposed to be the divine power conversion devices, right?! In order to change the bountiful light divine power of Lucifer into wind divine power!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he can\u2019t revive on its own strength, the inside of Lucifer\u2019s body is a treasury of divine power that can be changed into wind divine power!! Juo found him, Aniue gave him power, and I shot him! We desperately worked for this! That\u2019s why, revive!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Demon Lord, Raphael!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The flesh of the snake broke open.</p><br/><p>A part of Lucifer\u2019s body had been blown up from the inside, and a humanoid figure appeared from there.</p><br/><p>I remember that figure.</p><br/><p>That silhouette when he was in his full armor, it is truly that of one of the four Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>Wind Demon Lord, Raphael.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord that was supposed to have burned out his life in the fight with Hyue-chan has once again appeared here?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Success!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan raised a cheer while floating in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was all as Juo planned. As expected of my sister-in-law! How vexing!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if she was proud of her sister-in-law or if she is dissing her. Be clear, Hyue-chan.</p><br/><p>But she herself is probably conflicted about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 No way, that\u2019s impossible!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates was the one who had her face pale the most at the revival of Raphael.</p><br/><p>And, as if natural, the colorful butterfly wings disappear from the back of Lucifer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is mine. It is a matter of course to return them.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>The tone of the revived Raphael was strong.</p><br/><p>After having most of his body erased by Haine-san, he lost so much of his power that he couldn\u2019t maintain his body, but after taking away the divine power of Lucifer, he must have returned to his peak condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are in your armor? If you are completely revived, shouldn\u2019t it be fine to be in your flesh?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan speaks frankly to him in mid-air.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo nosy. I like this figure. My body has grown from its partially destroyed state, and it can\u2019t properly picture a grown state in its perfect condition. It instead reformed the armor as if it were what my body was originally as.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe form of the divine power is heavily influenced by the image of the individual itself. We have experienced that just now with the combined elemental dark matter, and yet, it is still hard to swallow\u2026\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think you people would be the ones who would save me.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>There was no happiness or anger in the voice of Raphael.</p><br/><p>In the past, these two fought fiercely with their hatred in plate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe settled things in that fight. In that case, let\u2019s start from zero.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and that Toreido Shiva guy\u2026 But, it won\u2019t be starting from zero.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Raphael says with strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy life was saved, so I am indebted to you people. For the sake of repaying that debt, I will have to defeat that big guy.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fiend has your friends as well. From now on, we will be helping each other out!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. To think Michael, Gabriel, and Uriel would get upped by an imbecile monster like this that only has size going for it. Looks like I really have to be by their side!!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>While throwing insults that had warmth in it, Raphael soars into the sky.</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan also follows him.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s now one pair less of wings in the six pairs of wings of Lucifer.</p><br/><p>From now on, we are going to crush it further!</p><ul><li>404: Humans and Demons together</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cRelease!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>The body of Raphael divided as if it had exploded?!</p><br/><p>\u2026No, that\u2019s not it. More accurately speaking, the parts of the full armor covering Raphael separated, and they were flying around individually?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the special technique of Raphael that Hyue-chan was talking about?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>While keeping up the release of dark matter, we were looking at the battle from the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you doing that again?! If your strength has been regained completely, you should just have a body inside your armor, you know?!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan throws a retort.</p><br/><p>In the past, Raphael apparently used the armor to compensate for the mostly erased body of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious that it is because it is cool?! Also, I can do this\u2026!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>The armor parts surround Lucifer and were emitting something.</p><br/><p>\u2026I don\u2019t hear anything?</p><br/><p>\u201c?! Ultrasound?!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan immediately strained her ears.</p><br/><p>\u201c! Okay! I have picked up the location where the people caught inside of Lucifer are-de gozaru!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>I see!</p><br/><p>In the time when we were fighting the giant monster named slime, we used ultrasound to check its inside and found the monster\u2019s core.</p><br/><p>They did the same as that time!</p><br/><p>Inside Lucifer, there\u2019s still the Demon Lords that have been engulfed and have had their powers robbed.</p><br/><p>And Haine-san as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-dono is the one that is specially deep inside, and I don\u2019t think we will be able to get him out unless we completely cut off all functions in Lucifer!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes\u2019 attachment to Kuromiya Haine seems to be on an incomprehensible level after all. In that case, let\u2019s take each one out beginning from the closest one!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Raphael released sound and Hyue-chan picked it up. The teamwork of hero and Demon Lord was already working perfectly.</p><br/><p>The two of them were soaring the sky at high speed while facing Lucifer.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh, now that it has come to this, let\u2019s stop the creation of the Black Hole temporarily and\u2026!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates was trying to deal with Hyue-chan and Raphael!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t let you!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>We increase the output of dark matter and push Lucifer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you stop the creation of the Black Hole right now, Lucifer will be swallowed by our dark matter! I wonder how much divine power you would lose before you are able to neutralize it with light divine power!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you, worms!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>We are stopping Ates and Lucifer.</p><br/><p>In that time, Hyue-chan!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people that are caught are inside a cage created by their own divine power!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it! In that case, the one we should release is\u2026!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>The separated armor of Raphael combines once again.</p><br/><p>But that figure was not human. What is it?</p><br/><p>\u201c[Raphael Cannon]\u201d</p><br/><p>Wa?!</p><br/><p>Raphael\u2019s armor turned into the shape of a big gun?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat ghost-like woman seems to have inputted a variety of things when she was extracting me. To think she would add such a function in me!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut right now it is necessary!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan shoulders the Raphael-san turned into a cannon, and just like that, she takes aim?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Raphael Cannon shoots a wind cannonball with Demon Lord level divine power. And on top of that, my God Hero divine power\u2026!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>A precise shot that holds the highest of firepowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Gun Technique [Tipping the Scales]!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>An attack that would pierce the heavens dug right into Lucifer and exploded right on contact!</p><br/><p>This attack easily shredded a chunk of Lucifer\u2019s flesh.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!\u201d (Lucifer)</p><br/><p>Lucifer writhes in pain.</p><br/><p>The wind divine power had hit the area where the earth element was the most concentrated at.</p><br/><p>In other words, the place that Hyue-chan had aimed was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooo!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Breaking out from the part that had been softened by the wind attack, a wood human came flying out from inside of Lucifer.</p><br/><p>The Earth Demon Lord Uriel-san has been released.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh! Another component has been\u2026!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>The earth wings began to disappear from the back of Lucifer.</p><br/><p>With this, there\u2019s four pairs remaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaphaeeeel!!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>And then, the released Uriel-san flew straight onto Raphael-san who had returned to humanoid form.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaphael, you were alive!! Uwaaaaaaah~!! Yahoooooo!!!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaa?! What are you doing?! So disgusting!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Raphael-san was shocked and amazed that he was being hugged.</p><br/><p>Since he doesn\u2019t know how saddened his comrades were after he died, it can\u2019t be helped that he would be confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Raphael!! I won\u2019t look down on you ever again~!! I am truly glad you are alive~~!!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah, so noisy! We are in the middle of battle! Don\u2019t go hindering our guard! Or more like, so you guys really were looking down on me?!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>It is truly great that Raphael-san has returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cUriel-dono\u2019s return-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>And there\u2019s also one here who was happy about the return of someone.</p><br/><p>The adult muchimuchi Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t stay here-dasu!! Karen-neechan! I will be going too-dasu yo!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also be adding mah earth divine power in ya holy sword-dasu! Well then, I be leaving the rest to ya-dasu yo!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Sasae-chan flew off.</p><br/><p>\u201cUriel-dono, long time no see-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiiih! Sasae-sama?!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u2018Sama\u2019?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not what you think\u2026.. The reason why I was late in my return, you see\u2026 Right, Lucifer! That fiend is completely at fault! Because it ate me, you see!!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat be of no importance-dasu yo! Right now, what be important be to fight-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say it doesn\u2019t matter, but\u2026that in itself is saddening!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>This grouping is also the same as always\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to save the caught Demon Lords, there be the need fer the elements of the respective weakness-dasu!

Gabriel is out as well!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Reviving Raphael served like a landslide. After he was brought back, a Demon Lord after another was being freed with the cooperation of the God hero and Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan raised a cheer as she gets closer to me with her hand still linked and releasing dark matter.</p><br/><p>And the Gabriel-san in question\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaa~~~!!

Didn\u2019t the Demon Lords have a much more of a dry relationship with each other?!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>No, it is already more wet than you could ever wish for.</p><br/><p>\u201cA damp relationship is just about right!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan soars.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, it is my turn!

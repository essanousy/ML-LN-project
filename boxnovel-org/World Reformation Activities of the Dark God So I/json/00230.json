Our era is practically a different world for Doraha, and that ability of hers can be said to be special in this world.</p><br/><p>The power of \u2018Shadow\u2019 that isn\u2019t any of the other known elements; different from all the five heroes of this world, in other words, a sixth hero \u2014the shadow hero, Doraha.</p><br/><p>And that Doraha speaks on the sted of her master that is Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of my abilities, \u2018Shadow\u2019 lets me burrow into the shadows and, via that shadow, I can move around. I won\u2019t be noticed by the humans around when I do that.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c!!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Grades and I looked at each other and send orders to the young light knights.</p><br/><p>\u201cInvestigate the surroundings of the library. Investigate at what direction the shadow of the building is pointing at!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Lately, there have been convenient things called ethereal wireless transmission devices, so the orders and reports happen in an instant.</p><br/><p>{Currently at 5 o\u2019clock, the shadows are all pointing west. Weather is good. The surroundings are bright, so the shadows are distinct too.}, the report soon came.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro adds to the explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoraha\u2019s ability is \u2018Shadow\u2019. It isn\u2019t \u2018Darkness\u2019. That\u2019s why shine as much light as possible, and the more clear the distinction between light and shadow is, the more advantageous it is for her.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>In the first place, \u2018Shadow\u2019 is a variety of the Light element.</p><br/><p>Where there\u2019s light, there\u2019s shadow.</p><br/><p>By absorbing light, it changes into \u2018shadow\u2019 that is a quasi-version of darkness.</p><br/><p>That is the shadow technique that was created in the ancient Underground Country. That\u2019s why the biggest weakness of \u2018shadow\u2019 is darkness, and a half-baked black has no choice but to be dyed by the thicker black that is darkness.</p><br/><p>But it is exactly because it is half-baked that there\u2019s also many things it can do.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter succeeding in infiltrating the library, I have to move to a room that is as bright as possible and has windows. In a dim room where the light and shadows are not distinct, a proper shadow won\u2019t be made, and I won\u2019t be able to hide my body.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Hearing this explanation, the other light knights also pitched in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, the inside of the library would be dangerous. In the first place, books are normally not exposed directly to sunlight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut ethereal lights have been installed inside the library recently, so in terms of lighting, there should be no problem. The perpetrators should also be scared of a surprise attack by us or an uprising from the hostages, so there\u2019s no way they would stay in a place that has bad vision.\u201d</p><br/><p>They are freely bringing out their opinions.</p><br/><p>It is still a dangerous situation, but the atmosphere that this young light knights give out makes me feel the fruits of the reformation, and that makes me happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama! Haine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san, who had left temporarily, had returned inside the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI used the flying machine to check out the library from above.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI managed to confirm the captured hostages through the window.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karen-san slides her finger through the map of the library that was spread at the table that\u2019s at the center of the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the large hall that\u2019s called \u2018the Goddess Space\u2019, there\u2019s an area there where outsiders would read the books in. It is plenty spacious. It looks like the hostages have been gathered there.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It is true that this is an adequate room to have a big amount of people to keep in check.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, the Light Grand Library is a big construction of three floors, but due to trying to appeal its artistic design and because of trying to secure a light source to read, the middle of the first floor, the \u2018Goddess\u2019 Space\u2019, has a big skylight made there. I could clearly see the figure of the hostages from there.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Is what Karen-san says as she gives a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>This result is thanks to being able to see from a vantage point that wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the flying machine.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-sama, that means the hostages aren\u2019t divided in different spaces, right?\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>General Grades asks with deep caution.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The hundred people that I managed to confirm beforehand were all there when I checked through the skylight, and just in case, I checked the other rooms, but I didn\u2019t find any traces of people being locked up there.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u2018It is only limited to the rooms that I can peek through the windows, though\u2019, is what Karen-san added.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Looks like the other side are amateurs! In this occasions, it is an established tactic to separate the hostages in order to keep an insurance, and yet, it looks like they didn\u2019t even do that!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Just that single point of everyone being gathered at one place had made the situation a lot better.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s still the delicate part about not damaging the important documents in the library though\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLives are top priority. Doraha will burrow into the shadows and infiltrate the place. After securing the safety of the hostages, the light knights will rush in from all the entrances of the library and suppress them. As speedy as possible. Whether the perpetrators are left dead or alive is not important.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro gives out cold-hearted instructions.</p><br/><p>Now that the path to resolving this issue is visible, it all depends now on whether the perpetrators will come with an unexpected move.</p><br/><p>After the meeting was over, what\u2019s left is to act.</p><br/><p>From the most important to the lowest, everyone knew their own role and mobilized in order to achieve it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>And in all that, I called out to Doraha who is the kernel of this plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Haine-sama?\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask something. Your power of burrowing into the shadows, is that limited to only you?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>That question actually made the people around react heavily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, don\u2019t tell me you are\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It is exactly that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also be going along. And I will be crushing those terrorist bastards myself.\u201d (Haine)</p><ul><li>231: Unbelievable passage</li></ul><br/><p>And so, the result was that, it is possible for Doraha to hide other people aside from herself inside the shadow.</p><br/><p>In reality, if that weren\u2019t the case, the clothes of Doraha wouldn\u2019t be able to enter and Doraha would have to enter the shadow butt-naked after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease think of being inside a shadow as being practically inside water.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, you can\u2019t breathe at all. So, the time that one can stay inside a shadow is incredibly limited.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning that it is only as long as you can hold your breath huh. In that case, it is fine. I am the type that can hold his breath for quite a while.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>To put it more precisely, I can utilize my dark matter to slow down the passage of time to make it so that I can pass a long time without the need of breathing, but explaining that would be a pain, so I just keep it as \u2018I can hold my breath for long\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san hurriedly interposes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is fine to accompany Doraha, then how about increasing the amount of people that infiltrate? The more people send to battle will increase the chances of success!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry to say, Karen-sama\u2026\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Doraha composedly says.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe amount of people that can burrow inside a shadow is proportional to the size of the shadow itself. Considering the nature of this time\u2019s plan, we have to think that the most we can bring is one more person.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, the better the reason Haine-san should be the one going.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro joins in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san is without doubt the strongest fighting force in this present time. On top of that, it is known that the perpetrators are using weapons that utilize ethereal in some way. The one who can adapt to an unexpected situation the best is Haine-san and his dark matter.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Even with that, she looked like she was worried as she showed an expression of disapproval.</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow your place, hero. You have the important duty of sending these two to where the hostages are.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The strictness of Yorishiro forcefully made Karen-san accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates had gone completely silent since the moment Yorishiro entered the place, but she has been in this meeting room this whole time. Or more like, she was not allowed to leave.</p><br/><p>If we were to let her go to a place where we can\u2019t see her, who knows what she would do.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay in the meeting room. I won\u2019t allow you to leave my side until this plan is completed.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the will of our Founder, I will of course obey.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates was obedient, but who knows how much of that obedience is how she actually feels.</p><br/><p>At any rate, I don\u2019t think we will be able to only look forward as we fight.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The particulars of Doraha reaching the hostages has already been planned.</p><br/><p>The flying machine of Karen-san comes to play again.</p><br/><p>This thing really does play a role everytime.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, in other words\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cDoraha-san and Haine-san will be entering the shadow of the flying machine.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Even the birds flying in the sky will make shadows. If we were to enter the shadow of an object in flight, the mobility will increase by a lot.</p><br/><p>The place where the hostages are held in supposedly has a skylight, so if the flying machine comes from the top and projects its shadow from the skylight, that will be enough to make the infiltration a success.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-sama, make sure to have the sun always at your back when flying, and please make sure not to make contact with the shadow of the building. If you mix with other shadows, there\u2019s the chance that we will be left in that other one.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Looks like the shadow ability has its own rules.</p><br/><p>In order to not be noticed by the perpetrators, Karen-san has to fly from a hidden location.</p><br/><p>When the flight gets stabilized, Doraha and I are supposed to burrow inside the shadow, but before we even began, something drew our attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Grades?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>We saw Grades-san heading somewhere.</p><br/><p>Where is he heading to?</p><br/><p>He should be in the meeting room viewing the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was supposed to be a secret since Haine-san would definitely try to stop him, but\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san says this now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to increase the success rate of the mission, General Grades took on the role of drawing attention. If the attention is drawn to General Grades, it would make things easier for Haine-san and Doraha-san.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The place where General Grades is heading to is without doubt the front entrance of the library.</p><br/><p>At that place, there\u2019s still Dobbe who is doing his habitual rambling speech.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad!! Standing in front of Dobbe who is definitely the one that has the most grudge of being fired from his position as a Knight General, if the current General that is Grades were to do that\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I was about to stop General Grades, but Karen-san stopped me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Grades-san is\u2026the person that truly deserve to be the Aurora Knight corps\u2019 General.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the time he was a vice-captain, he has been thinking about the knight corps more than anyone else. He wasn\u2019t born in an influential family, and rose up to vice-captain without a single thing backing him. But\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>That was by no means because he was greedy for promotion.</p><br/><p>That bald man was always treasuring the organization \u2014the people that conform this organization, and aimed for battle formations that would allow people to fight at their best.</p><br/><p>The amount of times that he has argued with his superiors that only saw for themselves were many.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person knows pretty well the meaning of fighting to protect. That\u2019s why Yorishiro-sama selected him as the new General when the reformation came.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>And now General Grades has decided on the most definite method to increase the chances of success. In order to make the mission a success, in order to protect the citizens.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get in the way of the General! We have to do what we must do!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The scold of Karen-san had already stopped my feet, but my gaze couldn\u2019t help but chase the back General Grades.</p><br/><p>And then, that person finally arrived at the front entrance of the library.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What\u2019s the matter with you?!\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>The bald man introduced himself to Dobbe who had already fallen to being a mere terrorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cAurora Knight corps\u2019 General, Dillon Grades-sama for you!\u201d (Grades)</p><ul><li>232: Necessary person</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cAurora Knight corps\u2019 General? Hmm, that\u2019s strange.\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>Dobbe was already a terrorist no matter where you look at him, but his attitude was still as if he were at the summit of everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen talking about the General of the Aurora Knights, there\u2019s only one in the world, and that is Zeberphon Dobbe. Taking my title without my permission is quite the rude thing to do, Vice-captain Grades.\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were not only fired from your position as General but from the Aurora Knights itself. You already don\u2019t have the right to be called a knight. Moreover, taking over a public facility at broad daylight and even bringing harm to the citizens; you can\u2019t even be called a human anymore, you are trash.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Grades takes a single breath before continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will give you a chance. Surrender yourself now and receive your punishment. If it\u2019s now, it should still be possible to give some pity to your verdict.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around!!\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>Dobbe shouts and throws the ethereal speaker to the ground. Its fragments fly around with force.</p><br/><p>\u201cI -the Aurora Knight\u2019s General- has stood up for the sake of justice! In order to bring justice to that damn Yorishiro that monopolizes the Light Church! In order to bring back true justice to the Church!!\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you referring to by true justice? Are you talking about the knight corps that you were in before?\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>The tone of General Grades had become that of a person dealing with an unruly child.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn your time as a General, you were doing whatever you pleased, and I who was being swung around also couldn\u2019t take it. Even when monsters appeared, you didn\u2019t want to leave the headquarters, and when there was no choice but to depart after delegating the leadership, you then began to wail about taking command yourself while you were still in headquarters.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>How unreasonable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much distance do you think the headquarters are from the actual spot? \u2018Don\u2019t take one step unless I order it\u2019, you said. If you had at least used an ethereal car to reduce the time to arrive at the place, it would have been better. What you were saying to the light knights was basically this: \u2018Die\u2019.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>And in reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the hero Karen-sama hadn\u2019t been with us, who knows how many light knights would have died because of you. Even if the ones that dealt the actual fatal damage were the fangs and claws of monsters, the one who did the killing were incompetent superiors like you. It is already a legit sin to have incompetent people -with only their big pride to talk about- standing at the top. And there\u2019s many more where that came from\u2026\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>You could feel the thick resentment of Grades in the times when he was a vice-captain.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because the garden of someone\u2019s house was beautiful, you would drive away the residents and put them in direct control of the knight corps; you would take the horses that the newcomer knights were riding just because they are good. There wasn\u2019t a single order of yours that could be considered that of a General. The moment Karen-sama had become a hero and began to distinguish herself, you demanded everyone from the knight corps to sign a declaration that we won\u2019t acknowledge Karen-sama as the hero. At that time, I felt like killing you. Being unable to actually do it has made me regret it all this time.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! You mere Vice-captain dares to!!\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>The direct provocation of General Grades had immediately made the incompetent Dobbe rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around, fake! A commoner like you with your dirty blood standing as General is an unforgivable sin in itself! A high-class position is fitting only for humans of high-class lineage! And that person is I -the head of the Zeberphon family!\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>\u201cA high-class lineage rises by accomplishing the duties that they have to do. If trash like you were to leave descendants, the Zeberphon ancestors would be crying from six feet under! Listen well!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>General Grades throws away the sword that was wrapped around his waist, the sword that could be said to be the proof of his status as a light knight, and raises his unarmed hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t put a single finger on you. If I were to scratch you, the hostages won\u2019t be safe, right? That\u2019s why I will only look down on you. I will look down on you thoroughly. If you have at least a little bit of conscience as the Aurora Knight\u2019s General, be ashamed to the extreme!!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t get closer! If you get any closer, I will\u2026!\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>Dobbe points the muzzle of the ethereal gun that was hanging at his side towards Grades.</p><br/><p>It is similar to the wind guns that the wind hero Hyue and the others use, but this one most likely shoots bullets purely out of ethereal power.</p><br/><p>It is a dangerous weapon that has plenty enough power to kill people.</p><br/><p>Even so, General Grades didn\u2019t falter.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well! In the first place, your post isn\u2019t something that you grasp just because you wish for it! It is entrusted to you by a person that is far higher than you! Once you are acknowledged, you can\u2019t refuse no matter how much you want to! That\u2019s how duties and titles work!!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Overwhelmed by the aura of General Grades, Dobbe takes one step back with his gun still in position.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven I don\u2019t have the confidence to do it! In this time when it is the most busiest of all, I was made the helmsman of the Aurora Knights. The hundreds of knights, and the several hundred thousands of people that those knights must protect. That\u2019s the amount of people that are on our shoulders! That\u2019s the amount of responsibility! If possible, I would want to run away. But now that I have been chosen to do it, I can\u2019t run away from it!!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Once ordered by someone high, you are also pushed to move higher.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damn brat Dobbe! Did you have that much of a resolve? At the times when you were the Aurora Knight\u2019s General, did you ever feel the responsibility that comes with it?! You haven\u2019t, have you?! I can say this with confidence! You only saw your duty as General as some sort of game! And in that game, we were the ones being played! That\u2019s why you are incompetent!!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now you are the same as a child wailing after having your game taken! But of course, the position of General is not a game! There\u2019s no logic where society should suffer for the tantrums of someone like you!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>The whole body of Dobbe began to tremble.</p><br/><p>General Grades\u2026 from the very beginning, I thought of him as a great person, but to think that he was a person that was able to bring out such pressure. No, that\u2019s not it. It is exactly because he has become the Knight General, it is exactly because he is the Knight General that the he rose along with his position.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up shut up! Don\u2019t get close! Don\u2019t go speaking high-and-mighty to me!\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>The trembling finger of Dobbe squeezed the trigger, and finally, a bullet was shot.</p><br/><p>*Bang!*</p><br/><p>But maybe because Dobbe sucks, or because the ethereal weapon\u2019s calibration was not good, the bullet flies at an unknown direction.</p><br/><p>It won\u2019t hit General Grades. It is not a trajectory that would hit him. But\u2026</p><br/><p>*Splat*</p><br/><p>The bullet pierces the hand of General Grades.</p><br/><p>He purposely moved his left hand to the trajectory of the bullet, and blood gushes out heavily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bullet was completely going at a course that would miss General Grades!</p><br/><p>Grades basically went and got hit himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you aiming?!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cAwawawawa!!\u201d (Dobbe)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go shooting at random places!! What are you gonna do if you hit a citizen?!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Amazing.</p><br/><p>That person is already winning purely by pressure! \u2014Ouch!</p><br/><p>Someone suddenly hit my head!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-sama, it is time.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Doraha was the one who hit me huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Grades is pulling the attention. This is the time to infiltrate the library.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>General Grades was so overwhelming, I got enraptured by it, but this mission, the core of it is for us to infiltrate the inside.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s how effective it was.</p><br/><p>Karen-san had finished all preparations and stabilized the course in the time time Grades was buying. And now, it would be our turn to use that opening.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Haine-sama. Please hold onto me tightly.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Doraha holds my hand and we slowly sink into the shadow of the flying machine.</p><br/><p>First the legs, then waist, and when it finally came to the head, all vision was lost.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to holding hands with Doraha, the shadow had accepted me as a target of the technique.</p><br/><p>Just like how she had explained, it was truly as if we were inside water. At the other side of what felt like a domain of water, I was able to slightly tell what was happening outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere we go!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I could hear the voice of Karen-san outside the shadow.</p><br/><p>The Light Grand Church; the plan to save the hostages had truly begun now.</p><ul><li>233: To the gunpowder warehouse</li></ul><br/><p>Entering a shadow felt mysterious.</p><br/><p>It is as if we were being moved along with the water tank.</p><br/><p>It felt as if it would continue endlessly and we were being pushed to the inside of a wall.</p><br/><p>When I look up, I could see the flying machine as if seeing it through a water surface.</p><br/><p>(Haine-sama, please don\u2019t lower your guard. Karen-sama will most likely only pass the skylight for a second.) (Doraha)</p><br/><p>The voice of Doraha also travelled to me in a totally different way from a normal space.</p><br/><p>(The moment the flying machine\u2019s shadow overlaps with the shadows of the objects inside the library, we will jump to that one. With that, we will be able to infiltrate the library\u2026\u2026but be careful.) (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>(Haine-sama is not a shadow user and simply entered the shadow with me as proxy. If at the moment when we jump to the other shadow you are left alone inside the shadow, who knows what would happen. Even I don\u2019t know.) (Doraha)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that?! What a scary prospect!</p><br/><p>I would be instantly shut inside the shadow then?!</p><br/><p>No, that would still be fine, but if I were to lose the guide that is Doraha and I am unable to leave the shadow for the rest of my life and have to stay there all alone\u2026just imagining it sends shivers to my spine!</p><br/><p>(Haine-sama, Haine-sama, the infiltration has been completed.) (Doraha)</p><br/><p>You serious.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s why I said it would take an instant, didn\u2019t I?) (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Right. When I look up, I could see the skylight that reflects the sky, and the figure of the flying machine is not there anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi!! How long is that \u2018Knight General\u2019 guy supposed to be outside?! He has told them our demands already, I hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I would know! \u2026That idiot, just because this is his homeland, he acts as the leader. He isn\u2019t of use at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone go to the entrance and check out what\u2019s going on! If that self-proclaimed Knight General-sama is still blabbering, shoot him death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go! Who are you ordering, you heathen?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026?</p><br/><p>Things are strange here?</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t feel at all like terrorists that have taken arms in order to fight the nation\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>(Haine-sama, for now, let\u2019s surface. Staying too long inside the shadow is not good.) (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>For now, I leave everything to Doraha and move through the shadow, and surfaced on a place where we can properly hide our bodies from the terrorists.</p><br/><p>The characteristic smell of paper and ink was permeating this library.</p><br/><p>Since this is a library, I thought that we wouldn\u2019t have any problems finding a place to hide due to the many bookshelves lined up, but the enemies are terrorists. The bookshelves are being used as barricades and to block the door of this place.</p><br/><p>As if saying that the books inside of it were in the way, the books were scattered everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow terrible.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>We managed to surface from the back of the desk that the librarian uses and hid our bodies there as we look around the place.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s the hostages.</p><br/><p>They have been gathered at a corner of the room, their numbers are close to a hundred, and surrounding them, there\u2019s clear ruffians with their swords unsheathed</p><br/><p>But those are not the only weapons those guys have on them\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat shape\u2026they look similar to the wind guns that the Wind Church uses.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Doraha whispers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are the same as the one Dobbe was using outside. Damn it. So ethereal weapons were really circulating from behind the scenes huh.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>That truth was, frankly speaking, a headache-inducing problem on the level of the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>But let\u2019s concentrate on what we have in front.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoraha, I have thought of something.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201cYour shadow, can you move it to a faraway place without being noticed?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as the shadow is connected to another shadow, it is possible to move through each shadow. As long as another thing\u2019s shadow overlaps with the shadow.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>I see. An interesting power.</p><br/><p>Depending on the application of the divine power, it can spread endlessly then. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good or a bad thing though.</p><br/><p>I once again look around. I catch sight of one that looks to be part of the terrorists.</p><br/><p>Of course, there\u2019s no way the terrorists here in the \u2018Goddess Space\u2019 are all of them.</p><br/><p>Counting Dobbe who is bawling outside, there should be lookouts in different locations.</p><br/><p>But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that this place is where the kernel of the terrorist group is.</p><br/><p>First, we will take control of this place, and take a foothold towards the resolution\u2014but the situation is always taking one step ahead of us.</p><br/><p>From within the group of hostages, one specially loud voice was raised.</p><br/><p>It is a little girl.</p><br/><p>Her age is around 6-7 years old. This girl that had come to the library to read picture books like any other day, but had been caught in this unreasonable situation.</p><br/><p>That crying voice of hers was probably a cry for help. Maybe to her parents, or to any other adult. But there were many in this room that would get rubbed in the wrong way by the cry of this young girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, shitty brat! Stop the crying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust kill her! There\u2019s plenty hostages anyways! It won\u2019t change with one or two missing!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we show example, the bunch will certainly be silent! These are the trash of the Light Church anyways! The lives of heathens are the same as trash!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s offer the death cries of these heathens to Nova-sama!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine punishment on the holy name of Coacervate-sama!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The terrorists raised gleeful voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose guys\u2026!\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>The expression of Doraha turned visibly ferocious as she heard them.</p><br/><p>That was a sign that she was changing into the \u2018Shadow\u2019 that engulfs the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I grabbed the shoulders of Doraha tightly.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need for you to become that fiend.</p><br/><p>If these people need divine punishment, I -the Dark God Entropy- will provide exactly that to them.</p><br/><p>I have plenty of divine punishment for everyone.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-227-229-incident\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 227-229 - Incident\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-234-236-well-deserved-divine-punishment\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 234-236 - Well-deserved divine punishment\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236340\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

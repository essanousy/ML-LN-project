She is none other than one of the five Gods who defeated him in the battle 1,600 years ago and sealed him. \u201cSo you were the one who released the seal huh. Moreover, you alone. That must mean quite a long time has passed already.\u201d \u201cYeah. The seal we -five Gods- placed on you, in normal circumstances, there would be the need of all five of us in order to undo it, just like in the time of the sealing. But it has already deteriorated. It had loosened enough for me to undo it on my own\u2026\u2026I will say it once again\u2026\u201d The Light Goddess continues, \u201cIt has been 1,600 years long, Dark God Entropy. My loved one.\u201d \u201c\u20261,600 years. One thousand six hundred years?!\u201d (Entropy) Digesting those words, the Dark God trembled. \u201cWith that much time passed, the humans must have changed quite a lot. How are they doing? Have they evolved properly? You Gods have not interfered unnecessarily, right?\u201d (Entropy) \u201cGood grief, you haven\u2019t changed at all even after 1,600 years. Always going about humans, humans. You don\u2019t care about me at all.\u201d The Light Goddess gave out a displeased atmosphere, but the Dark God didn\u2019t loosen his words. \u201cIn the battle at the world\u2019s creation, you guys won. You wouldn\u2019t understand just how anxious I got. Because you only saw humans as trash after all.\u201d (Entropy) \u201cYou were the weird one for being excessively attached to humans. That\u2019s why, in the fight 1,600 years ago, there were no allies on your side.\u201d \u201cAnd because of it, I lost. I have no grudge on that part. However, if in the time I was sealed, you guys have treated them inappropriately, and have hindered their natural evolution\u2026\u201d (Entropy) \u201cYou will begin it again? The battle\u2026of Gods.\u201d Light and Darkness; the gaze of the two Gods clash. \u201c\u2026Also, after a glance at the current world -maybe because of it being 1,600 years already- my heart is dancing to see how it has changed.\u201d (Entropy) \u201cFine. Then let\u2019s look at it from above right now\u2014\u201d \u201cNo\u2026\u201d (Entropy) He stops the Light Goddess that was about to open the window to look below. \u201cEven if I were to look down at it from such a high place, I will only be able to understand the surface of it. In order to understand humans more, it would be nice to do it alongside them, standing on the same viewpoint.\u201d (Entropy) \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d At the question of the Light Goddess, the Dark God answers with a smile on his face. \u201cI am going to reincarnate as a human.\u201d * * * On that day, a new life was born at a certain house. An unusually energetic boy. This married couple that was blessed with a child for the first time, named him \u2018Haine\u2019 and raised him with care. And this child is the very person that had the soul of the God of Darkness who had fought with the five Gods at the world\u2019s creation 1,600 years ago. The story begins by the time Haine has turned 18 years old.</div><br/>\n</div>"}

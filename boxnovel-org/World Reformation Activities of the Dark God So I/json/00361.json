Is the only trait of that big thing its weight?\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep barking! Fine, bear witness to the power of the Wind Mobile Gun, Kukulkan!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The left arm of Kukulkan is directed at Raphael.</p><br/><p>This left arm has a big gunport equipped to it.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Wind Rippling Gun, Nobel]!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>At that instant, the air between Hyue and Raphael exploded.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t shoot a bullet of wind, but made the air itself exploded in the area between them to deal damage to the target. This is a technique that resembled the one Shiva used in his time as a wind hero, the wind dual gun technique.</p><br/><p>It is an attack that explodes the air in the target\u2019s surrounding with no time lag, making it impossible to avoid or defend.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c[Vacuum Blade]\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Raphael had nullified it as if nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a stupid technique. You can easily block this attack by cutting off the air in the surroundings.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>And then, Raphael made a sudden descent from the sky, at close range to where Hyue is \u2014to where Kukulkan is.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, I have already found the weakness of that big thing.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Raphael stands at the feet of the robot.</p><br/><p>Kukulkan\u2019s size is enough to have one human inside, so its body is pretty big, and it had to look down at Raphael, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt covers its whole body with thick metal to protect itself, and has several types of wind guns installed to it. As a result, it has this big of a body\u2026\u2026 But it is exactly because of its big frame that you can\u2019t do anything when approached like this.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>It is as Raphael says.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the arms of Kukulkan are not made as dextrous as a human\u2019s arm, and it takes its all to use it as a battery.</p><br/><p>If he were to enter into the inside range of those arms, Hyue would lose all means of attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue revved the mobility engine of Kukulkan and was thinking of retreating at high speed, in order to create distance.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s no way the Demon Lord would allow this.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo slow!!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>From each of the five fingers of the gauntlet of Raphael, tightly compressed air claws were shot.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Kamaitachi]\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Their sharpness made it hard to believe that it was air, and it easily cut the metallic armor of Kukulkan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuaaaaah!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue took a defensive stance, and thanks to that, both of the arms of Kukulkan had been cleanly cut.</p><br/><p>With that, there\u2019s no way she will be able to use the weapons installed in them, and won\u2019t be able to defend herself with that same move anymore.</p><br/><p>If he were to do the same attack, it would be the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t even think of the possibility of me fighting you in close range? Well, the first time we fought, I did leave all the job to the size of my divine power and was attacking crudely after all.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cGuuuh\u2026\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt just means I have also grown. Even if you guys were to try struggling with your schemes, I will always be walking ahead of you humans. One of the proofs that monsters are superior to humans.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>It is true that Kukulkan wasn\u2019t made with plans of fighting a Demon Lord in close combat.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the Wind techniques themselves are not suited for close combat. That\u2019s the territory of the Earth techniques.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, Kukulkan not being suited for close combat is not the fault of Juo-san and the driver Hyue\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, let\u2019s leave the playing around. How about fighting seriously now? Show your trump card.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cW\u2026What?!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue dragged the feet of Kukulkan and took a fighting stance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you playing dumb? Did you think I didn\u2019t know?\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cGod Hero. God-He-ro.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Those words made not only Hyue gulp her breath but me as well.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it something to be so surprised about? Michael, Gabriel, and Uriel were defeated by the God Heroes, right? There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true, but that\u2019s not the problem here!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means that, in the end, humans have received power from the Gods and have finally managed to be equal to Demon Lords. Now, go ahead and turn into a God Hero as well. No need to hold back. In your case, you would be the Wind God Hero, right?\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyue kept silent inside Kukulkan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys finally managed to fight equally with us after becoming God Heroes. If I don\u2019t crush you in that state, there would be no point in this fight. In order to have you taste true defeat\u2026turn into a God Hero.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>What came out from Hyue was clear refusal.</p><br/><p>Hyue refused turning into the Wind God Hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have decided. This fight is one that I will overcome with my own strength. By defeating you with my own strength, I will be able to become a true hero.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cLine up, Demon Lord Raphael! I will be the one to defeat you! No God Hero, or anyone else; it will be this wind hero, Toreido Hyue!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><ul><li>362: Point of no return</li></ul><br/><p>Why are you so stuck in fighting alone, Hyue?!</p><br/><p>A Demon Lord is originally not an opponent that a single human can do something about.</p><br/><p>In the fight of Michael and Mirack, the confrontation of Celestis and Gabriel, the overwhelming of Uriel by Sasae-chan; it is not as if they overcame those difficulties by themselves.</p><br/><p>Humans and Gods, humans and humans, and even humans and demons; with those many connections, they changed it into strength and managed to overcome those things that strength alone wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s supposed to be a strength of the humans.</p><br/><p>Why are you throwing that strength away and challenging the Demon Lord?!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What. So you won\u2019t be turning into a God Hero huh.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Raphael was showing a truly bored expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I have no further business with you. I will kill you quickly and go after the next prey.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>His gaze is directed at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, it will be you, Kuromiya Haine. Since you are already close by, I will be having my revenge for the first time we fought.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Being directed clear hostility, I got on guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe next would be that man called Shiva. I will never forget the humiliation this Demon Lord Raphael received from you and him. Once I settle that, I will be beginning the humanity eradication plan at full.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cFine then. Before fighting, tell me something.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Dark matter was already being released minutely from both of my arms.</p><br/><p>If Hyue won\u2019t turn into a God Hero, I am the only one here who can defeat him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we really have to fight each other?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh?\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought at first that there was no other way but having only one side survive. That there was no way but to fight and decide by the erasure of the other. That\u2019s how I thought.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>But the ones who taught me that this was a flawed way of thinking were the humans that look weak at a glance.</p><br/><p>They placed their all in their fight and made the impossible possible.</p><br/><p>What brought this about was the strength that\u2019s deep inside the heart of humans, the ability to belief.</p><br/><p>This surpassed races and even reached the lord of monsters; they changed them.</p><br/><p>The coexistence of humans and demons that even Gods didn\u2019t believe in, the humans were trying to make it true.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour comrade, Michael, said that he accepted walking alongside humans. Gabriel and Uriel as well.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Not a future where you step on someone else to gain glory, but a future where everyone shares the glory.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaphael, can\u2019t you also walk alongside us?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>If he does that, there\u2019s no need for us to fight here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, every single one of you people, wasting time with such stupid things.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>But my expectations were betrayed by those simple words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that Michael said something like that too. That instead of eradicating humans, we should walk alongside them\u2026!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>So Michael is really trying to fulfill his promise with us.</p><br/><p>And Raphael is trying to go the completely opposite path.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?! Why can\u2019t you walk the same path?! Even when you are a Demon Lord like Michael and the others!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026 If I had to say a difference, it would be\u2026\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>I could feel a deep deep dark gaze from the opening of the helmet that covers the whole face of Raphael.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat we have already begun our battle.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u2026?</p><br/><p>What does he mean by that?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy fight with you people has already begun. Thus, it won\u2019t be stopped until it reaches a conclusion. And that conclusion will be either me dying or you guys dying; those are the only two possible conclusions.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean. Michael and the others overcame their battles with the humans and reached an understanding with them.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThose can\u2019t be called battles. They didn\u2019t fight humans at all. The only one who has experienced a battle between humans and demons is me, this Raphael.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain yourself clearly!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand? We Demon Lords were born from our mothers the Mother Monsters almost at the same time, but the only one who had to fight immediately after being born was me. Even now, I can still remember it. You guys were there when I broke out from the Demonic Green Imperial Egg my mother Beelzebub gave birth to.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, we fought. At that time, you said this: \u2018if we can\u2019t coexist, we have no choice but to fight until one side is gone\u2019. I clearly remember this. My fight with you humans was exactly that kind of fight.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Even now, I still couldn\u2019t see clearly what Raphael was trying to say.</p><br/><p>Just what is it Raphael is looking for in our fight?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is exactly as you say, Demon Lord Raphael.\u201d</p><br/><p>And there, a voice resonates.</p><br/><p>It was Hyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember it too. The day you first appeared in front of us.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief. You still want to fight? I am not interested in you who can\u2019t turn into a God Hero though.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>It is true that it was impossible to ask for further battle with Kukulkan missing both arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just like that time\u2026! You didn\u2019t see me as a threat at all and completely put me out of your peripheric. While Haine-dono and Aniue were fighting with their all, I couldn\u2019t do anything\u2026!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>In the first battle with Raphael, Shiva and I cooperated to try and erase all the cells of Raphael without leaving a single one behind.</p><br/><p>Hyue was indeed there as well.</p><br/><p>\u2026And she was almost completely on the receiving end.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to taste that feeling of worthlessness anymore. This time, I will surely defeat you with my own hands. \u2026As a hero. In the name of this title of wind hero that I succeeded from Aniue-sama!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cYour spirit is nice, but if it isn\u2019t accompanied with power, it just looks unsightly. If you are not going to turn in a God Hero, elaborate in how you plan on defeating me with that piece of scrap that\u2019s close to breaking.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd as I said, you underestimate us too much. Just like in the past!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen all the wind guns equipped in Kukulkan yet!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>At some point in time, a large amount of spheres were surrounding Raphael.</p><br/><p>Black spheres that had a propeller-looking thing coming out from their top that was rotating.</p><br/><p>They were flying in the air with that.</p><br/><p>With a glance, I could tell that there were tens of them. They were flying around as if surrounding Raphael.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Gun Rebellion, Koumei!! This is the first piece that will be driving you to checkmate!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><ul><li>363: Ultimate blow</li></ul><br/><p>Wind Gun Rebellion, Koumei.</p><br/><p>This is supposed to be the wind divine tool of the proxy wind hero, Juo-san.</p><br/><p>It is a specially unique one even within the many divine tools.</p><br/><p>By having these things that are apparently called bits fly in the air at every direction desired, you attack with the small wind guns equipped in them.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it is not only one, there are several. It is a weapon that can attack from all directions and instills fear in not knowing from which direction it will be coming next.</p><br/><p>But obviously, Juo-san is not here.</p><br/><p>Then, the one controlling those wind guns is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue\u2026is it you?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wind Gun Rebellion, Koumei, is a divine tool that requires a grasp on the space and high processing ability which the genius Juo possessed. Making this divine tool impossible to master by anyone else. It is normally not something I can master-de gozaru\u2026\u2026 But\u2026\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The robot she is riding makes a low growl.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the assistance of Kukulkan, I can somehow utilize it as well. All thirty bits! Right now, they are all my imperial guards-de gozaru!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what of it?\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Even when surrounded, Raphael was calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you seriously think that with ten or twenty of these pebbles, you will be able to defeat me. If that\u2019s really the case, I might have to reevaluate my view of you. To that of an idiot that surpasses my wildest of imaginations.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what you say, this is my trump card. If you couldn\u2019t notice that, then you are the one that\u2019s an idiot!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. Then test it out. Test if these pebbles can really injure me.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be doing that.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Raphael tilts his head in puzzlement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wind Gun Rebellion is only an encirclement to stop your movements!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa\u2026? Kugh, what?!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Raphael\u2019s voice suddenly began to show unrest.</p><br/><p>But it was only his voice, his body didn\u2019t budge a bit. When agitated, your limbs would normally move to show it as well.</p><br/><p>It looked as if Raphael couldn\u2019t move even if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You\u2026what did you do to me?! Why is my body not moving?!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Can you really not move, Raphael?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones flying around are not wind guns used for normal attacks. They are speakers that emit a special sound wave-de gozaru!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA stiffening sound wave that Juo discovered in her researches. By mixing in sound and divine power, it hardens the wind divine power, and makes it possible to stop movement!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! Even if there\u2019s logic to it, there\u2019s no way an idea of humans would be able to stop me, a Demon Lord! Me who has several tens of times more divine power than you people!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why\u2026-de gozaru!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue showed a ferocious smile that felt as if fangs could show.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis stiffening sound wave only works on wind divine power. The bigger the divine power, the stronger the restrain-de gozaru! And more so since monsters are pure masses of divine power. The Demon Lords that stand at the summit are giant masses of divine power themselves. Truly a trump card exclusive for the Wind Demon Lord!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWith your movements sealed, there\u2019s no better moment to hit you with this!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The gun barrel that\u2019s installed at the back of Kukulkan came out and is placed on its shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>What I saw at its test drive.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, the Wind Main Cannon, Beethoven.</p><br/><p>The strongest wind gun that\u2019s installed in Kukulkan!</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, I will blow every single cell of yours! This will seal the battle! Demon Lord Raphael!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastaaaard!!!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>*Doooon!*</p><br/><p>Without a single bit of hesitation, the huge cannon roared.</p><br/><p>The one shooting it is Hyue, so there\u2019s no way it would be missing. The cannon that\u2019s hailed to have the strongest firepower had impacted accurately where Raphael was.</p><br/><p>It created a giant explosion of wind in the area of impact and mowed down everything in the place.</p><br/><p>Even I had a hard time staying on my feet from this distance.</p><br/><p>Just the blast of when the wind shell was shot had created a massive gale that raised stones and dust in the area, making it hard to even see.</p><br/><p>But once the actual explosion came, it created such a strong wind that just keeping my eyes open was painful. I had to cover myself with both arms and a thin veil of dark matter.</p><br/><p>Firepower that could blow off a mountain.</p><br/><p>Raphael had his movements sealed with the special sound waves, so he shouldn\u2019t have been able to evade or defend.</p><br/><p>It is certain that it hit him directly.</p><br/><p>And the result is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026nothing?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>At the place where Raphael was supposed to be restrained, there was not a single fragment left behind.</p><br/><p>It was completely empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas he really blown off? Without leaving a single cell behind?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Raphael can escape by changing his cells into insects, so if it weren\u2019t for that special sound wave, it would have been impossible to catch him.</p><br/><p>To think she would have such an effective trump card!</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026! Hah\u2026!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>And that Hyue was breathing in a fashion that seemed as if every breath she took was painful.</p><br/><p>The spheres flying around have all fallen to the ground as if saying they had run out of energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue, are you okay?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026As I thought, the recoil of using the Wind Cannon is rough-de gozaru na. Juo said that she increased the resistance around the cockpit, but it is far from perfect.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Even with that, it is a lot better than the test drive where she was knocked out by it.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really managed to defeat Raphael!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. With this, we can enjoy Aniue-sama\u2019s wedding without worries\u2026\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The voice of Hyue, even when exhausted, was filled with a sense of accomplishment.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I thought this. What will Michael and the others think when they learn about this?</p><br/><p>To think I would be worrying about something like this. I already can\u2019t tell what\u2019s right or wrong anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Without worries huh? Then, how about I help out in making that wedding even grander?\u201d</p><br/><p>?!</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that voice just now?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will make it so bright red flowers sprout in the whole city.\u201d</p><br/><p>This voice is from Raphael?!</p><br/><p>He is alive?!</p><br/><p>Did he escape from that restrain or somehow managed to endure the attack?!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-dono! Look at that-de gozaru!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue was also at her wit\u2019s end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ground\u2026!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Ground?</p><br/><p>When I look at the surroundings as pointed out, at this wasteland where the grass was growing here and there, there were metal glints.</p><br/><p>\u201cMetal\u2026 Armor!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The full-body armor of Raphael.</p><br/><p>It had been dismantled and dispersed here and there.</p><ul><li>364: Unprepared Demon Lord</li></ul><br/><p>Raphael, in order to compensate for his body that was mostly destroyed in the battle before, had covered his body in full-body armor.</p><br/><p>The kind that covers his whole body without leaving openings.</p><br/><p>That has now disassembled and was scattered far apart on the ground.</p><br/><p>I can tell that the inside is empty when straining my eyes. There\u2019s nothing inside.</p><br/><p>What is the meaning of this?!</p><br/><p>Then where did Raphael go?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is me, I am here.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>And then, an abnormality occurred.</p><br/><p>The armor parts that were scattered on the ground had flown up into the sky all at once.</p><br/><p>They flew in the sky as if they were living beings, as if they had a will of their own.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is happening-de gozaru?!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The flying armor parts were dancing in the sky as they piece each other like parts of a puzzle.</p><br/><p>The forearm and upper arm joined together, and the hard thighs join as well. Furthermore, they assemble together with the trunk area, and in the end, the head settles at the topmost part.</p><br/><p>Then, colorful butterfly wings spread from the back, and the Demon Lord had completely regained his previous form.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa\u2026 Wa\u2026?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t understand what was happening.</p><br/><p>At the time when the armor was in pieces, I couldn\u2019t see anything inside of it, in other words, it was hollow.</p><br/><p>Does that mean that even when it has reconstructed itself to its previous form, the inside is empty?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026! So that\u2019s how it was!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Looks like Hyue had noticed something.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember-de gozaru, Haine-dono! That armor is supposedly to compensate for the lacking state he was in after being almost completely erased by Haine-dono\u2026 But!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t restore enough cells to the point of reconstructing his body.</p><br/><p>The most he would be able to manage is to form those butterfly wings at his back.</p><br/><p>Even so, Raphael wanted to look the part of a Demon Lord, so he desired a humanoid appearance.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he utilized that armor.</p><br/><p>\u2026Is that how it is?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat armor was actually empty, and it was simply being controlled with wind divine power-de gozaru. In other words, it was a papier mache puppet-de gozaru yo!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 I will at least give you that.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Raphael answers calmly.</p><br/><p>But that presence he gave off was exuding silent anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was truly a troublesome thing, you know. Kuromiya Haine, because you erased most of my body, I ran late compared to the other three and felt as if I was being looked down on. In order to escape from that humiliation, I wanted a body no matter what. That\u2019s when I met this guy.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Raphael hits his metallic armor.</p><br/><p>\u2026No, I don\u2019t even know if I can call that the main body of Raphael anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cI found this guy at the ruins of a residence. Maybe because the owner was missing for several decades, the residence had lots of dust accumulated in it and lots of weed growing in it too. What was abandoned in it was this guy here.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Must have been a decoration from a prosperous noble.</p><br/><p>It is human-shaped and has at least enough space for the joints to move.</p><br/><p>And so, the few insect cells remaining took residence inside the armor like a hermit crab.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the attack just now was truly dangerous. We monsters are beings of pure divine power,so I didn\u2019t have any techniques to escape from that sound wave. If I was purely in my monster body, that is.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>But right now, Raphael is in his temporary shelter that is the armor.</p><br/><p>Even if Hyue were to mix divine power in the air to release stiffening sound waves, it wouldn\u2019t have any effect on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hurriedly withdrew my cells inside the armor and tried lowering my divine power to its utmost limit. Thanks to that, I was able to escape the restrain, and the gravity brought the armor down to the ground. The shockwave of the shot helped in dispersing the armor outside the blast range. It was a close one.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>He managed to pull off something like that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I was in my normal state, it would have been impossible to do. If I were to hold back too much of my divine power, I wouldn\u2019t be able to retain my self, and I would vanish. By maintaining my existence in the shell that was this armor, I was able to keep my divine power to almost zero without vanishing, and managed to protect myself\u2026 How ironic, don\u2019t you think? It is exactly because I ended up in this pathetic look that I was able to avoid your attack.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh\u2026!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue grinds her teeth hearing Raphael\u2019s triumphant voice.</p><br/><p>That move was her sure-kill plan to defeat the Demon Lord after all. She definitely took a lot of time making plan after plan and making sure it would take form.</p><br/><p>And to think that all of it would be broken in such a way\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you exhausted a heavy amount of divine power by shooting that wind cannon. A mere human wouldn\u2019t be able to shoot twice of those in a row. In other words, your plan has completely misfired, and it is impossible to do the same thing twice.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, I have thought of a new technique thanks to what happened just now. I will show it to you now, so enjoy it to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>Right after he finished speaking, Raphael\u2019s body scattered as if it had exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, each part of the armor disassembled.</p><br/><p>Each part of the armor was flying sharply like a swallow, they flew around around Hyue and I.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!! See that?! I grasped the ability to completely control each part just now! It means that I have managed to change trouble into a chance for growth!\u201d (Raphael)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo fast!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The speed in which the armor parts were flying around in was more than expected, and I could tell that this was bad.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t just one armor part after all.</p><br/><p>If I were to concentrate on the movements of one part, the others would attack in that opening! Moreover, it is metallic, so it might even lead to fatal injuries if they to hit parts like the cranium!</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue! Sorry, but I will be assisting here!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Hyue has poured all her divine power in her plan, so she can\u2019t resume battle anymore.</p><br/><p>Now that it has come to this, I will be fighting Raphael!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t-de gozaru!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was suddenly blown away by a strong power.</p><br/><p>The broken arm of Kukulkan had pushed me away.</p><br/><p>Because of that, I rolled to quite the distance away from Hyue, and Hyue was left alone in the middle of the flying pieces of Raphael!</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue! Why do you go to such lengths to fight alone?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>What is she getting so hung up over?! Why is she so stubbornly trying to be alone?!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you were to fight alone! Even if you were to win alone! There\u2019s no pride as a hero in that! A hero\u2019s duty is to protect the people! Mixing in pointless stubbornness, that in itself would make you a failure as a hero!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am fully aware of that-de gozaru\u2026! But, I just can\u2019t not be stubborn about it-de gozaru\u2026!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue answers with lack of breath.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt that she is practically out of stamina.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can feel it-de gozaru\u2026\u2026 Raphael, that\u2019s the same for you as well. You are the same kind as me-de gozaru!!\u201d (Hyue)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-358-360-celebrating-with-friends\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 358-360 - Celebrating with friends\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-365-366-lacking-in-ability\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 365-366 - Lacking in ability\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236391\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

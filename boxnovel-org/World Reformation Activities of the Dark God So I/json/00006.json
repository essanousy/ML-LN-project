It overwhelmed a countryside person like me.</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufu, are you surprised?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san who is accompanying me, was looking pleasantly at me who had turned into a country bumpkin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this your first time in Apollon City?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, rather than calling it my first experience in a city, it would be more like, this is my first time going out of the village. Everything I see is surprising.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? In my case, it was surprising to see a completely different side of Haine-san. Since I met you, I always thought you were a cool person after all.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Karen-san, what\u2019s that?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not listening at all\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>What caught my interest were the vehicles that were running around the city.</p><br/><p>No, vehicles are normally things that are pulled by cows or horses, but these vehicles have nothing pulling them. The vehicle is moving by itself.</p><br/><p>Moreover, in this paved road, there\u2019s not only one of those kind of vehicles, there\u2019s several of them, and they were going back and forth.</p><br/><p>In other words, that vehicle that moves on its own isn\u2019t something special, but a common thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an ethereal car.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEthereal car?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cA vehicle that moves with ethereal.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It seems she is trying to explain it, but it didn\u2019t serve as an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph\u2026it is a vehicle that has degraded humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who said this in a bad mood was, as expected, captain Vesage who was together with us. The knight corp that he leads as well, and there\u2019s also the other corps that had spread to other locations in order to recruit new members and had reunited as we were getting closer to the light capital. It had become quite the orderly mass.</p><br/><p>Within that group, there were a number of people that had accepted the recruitment like me.</p><br/><p>And so, the talk of captain Vesage continues.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause something like that exists, people have forgotten the grace of the Light Goddess and have become arrogant. Hey, newcomer, I will be telling you this in advance since you are a country bumpkin. The light church completely forbids the use of such machines. Remember that.\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>It is true that the knights of the light church, even when there\u2019s this many adults, are all walking on foot or riding a horse.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s this many, so it would have been easier to just prepare a big one of those things called ethereal cars and bring them along that way.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Vesage, please don\u2019t vent it on Haine-san. Seriously, you have been grumpy since the time in the village.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Hero-dono, our corp was assigned a quota of 50 people. And yet, we only brought back one. What would the founder-sama and the knight\u2019s commander say?!\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they complain, I don\u2019t mind you telling them it was all my fault. Also, I think this one recruit was our highest result in this time\u2019s recruitment expedition.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d \u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vesage and I react at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one recruit\u2026are you referring to this country bumpkin?\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Haine-san didn\u2019t hesitate against the [Holy Light Bullet] shot by captain Vesage and was able to deal with it perfectly. Even when it was his first time seeing it.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFast and precise decision making. On top of that, those quick-witted movements, there\u2019s no shortcomings in having him as a fighting force as he is now. Isn\u2019t this the kind of talent we were looking for?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cGugugugu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>What Karen-san was saying must have been sound, but captain Vesage, who was defeated by me, was unable to obediently consent to it and was grinding his teeth.</p><br/><p>And so, in order to not worsen the situation, I decide to stay silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But\u2026it all depends on whether this country bumpkin can show results in the entrance exam of the knight corps.\u201d (Vesage)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that point, there\u2019s no problem. I believe in him.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>What are they talking about?</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasiness towards the talk of those two.</p><br/><p>While we were in the middle of that, we arrived at the last point of our journey.</p><br/><p>The Light Grand Church located at the center of Apollon City.</p><br/><p>This is where the main headquarters of the light church that follow the Light Goddess, Inflation, is located.</p><ul><li><strong>07: Entrance Exam</strong></li></ul><br/><p>\u201cThe ones aiming to enroll, gather over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>When we crossed the gates of the Grand Church, the people that were not wearing armor were gathered quickly.</p><br/><p>It is the people that were gathered from the recruitment expedition.</p><br/><p>I am also one of them, but calling me as someone \u2018aiming to enroll\u2019 doesn\u2019t click in me.</p><br/><p>Karen-san and captain Vesage have long gone somewhere else.</p><br/><p>As a hero and a captain, they have their own duties to perform.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well maggots! I commend you for gathering at the side of the light! From today on, you are one of the prided members of the light church!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one talking to the newcomers is a somewhat asphyxiating bald old man.</p><br/><p>It seems something has already started.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, even if I say \u2018light church\u2019 in general, the roles are many. Priests that offer prayers to the Light Goddess, the people that look after those priests; and then, there\u2019s the military power of the church, the Aurora Knight Corps associated with it, the Light knights! That\u2019s the majority of it but\u2026ah right right!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bald old man had a face as if saying \u2018I will be saying something interesting now\u2019 as he puts on airs in his tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithin this group, if there\u2019s someone that\u2019s aiming to become the Light Hero, this is for your own good, just give up in advance. A person that surpasses Karen-sama who is the one currently in active duty, it would take at least 30 years before someone like that appears!!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he finished, incredible cheers came from the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that the preliminary talk has been wrapped up\u2026maggots, I will have you take an exam. Don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t be making you do anything difficult. We are only using this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, the old man lifts something in his hand.</p><br/><p>It was hard to make out because my position was far away, but it seems to be some sort of board.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is called an element board, and it is a tool to identify your element. Everything in this world has received the divine blessing of the five Gods that created this world. Earth, fire, water, wind, and light; these five elements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking carefully at the board that the old man was carrying, I could see that it is shaped in a clean pentagon, and at each side, there\u2019s the symbol of the earth, fire, water, wind, and light Gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen a person holds this element board, this needle at the center will identify your element. We, the Light Church, will of course welcome the light element. The people that have the needle of the element board pointing at the light element will unconditionally enter the Aurora Knight Corps!!\u201d</p><br/><p>After this explanation, the actual exam began.</p><br/><p>The aspirators were lined up and were holding the element board in turns.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind element! Rejected!\u201d Water element! Rejected!\u201d \u201cLight element! Pass!\u201d</p><br/><p>That voice resounded inside the Grand Church.</p><br/><p>While we were at it, my turn came. The face of that bald old man soon got right in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you are Kuromiya Haine, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? That\u2019s right but, why do you know my name?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell fine. At any rate, try holding it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Is what the old man said as he holds out the pentagonal board to me. At that moment, the needle of the element board pointed towards a place that was slightly to the left of the light symbol.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s probably the element of this old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight right, I am the vice captain of the Aurora Knight Corps, Grades. If you are going to join the knight corps, I will become a direct superior of you. I forgot to tell you.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cSay something like that to everyone please. What\u2019s with this open bias.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hero Karen-sama told me to take good care of you. I have also heard about your rebellion towards Vesage. If you can become an instant fighting force, I also welcome you with big open arms, that\u2019s all.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>I see, so that\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>At any rate, I take the element board from the vice captain Grades.</p><br/><p>Now then, I wonder what it will show\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Hm?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Creaking sounds came from the element board.</p><br/><p>The needle of the element board, I don\u2019t know what it is made of, but it is probably metallic.</p><br/><p>The creaking sound continued. And then, right after, the needle bended without anyone touching it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhaaat?!!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Vice Captain Grades who was looking at it right in front of me was also surprised.</p><br/><p>Without pointing at any of the elements, the needle of the element board broke itself and pointed to the sky.</p><br/><p>As the God of Darkness, my element is of course, darkness.</p><br/><p>For this element board that has no entry for darkness, there was no way for it to accurately identify my element.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-03-05-the-light-knights\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 03-05 - The Light Knights\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-08-10-grunt-of-light\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 08-10 - Grunt of Light\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236248\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

It seems all monsters come from them.</p><br/><p>In other words, if all Mother Monsters are defeated, new monsters will not be appearing anymore.</p><br/><p>It means monsters will be eradicated from this world.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s true, there\u2019s nothing as amazing as that. I want to help in that too.</p><br/><p>Dealing with monster problems is exactly the job of us heroes.</p><br/><p>And yet, Haine-san didn\u2019t bring me with him.</p><br/><p>How mortifying. I don\u2019t agree to this.</p><br/><p>We can save the whole world; I can be of help to Haine-san.</p><br/><p>To think I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything when I am aware of those chances\u2026</p><br/><p>*****</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Grand Church\u2019s parlor room of the Light capital, Apollon City, a displeased voice reverberated.</p><br/><p>Even though my bad mood won\u2019t lose to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you telling me we have been gathered here just to hear you complain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo sum it up, yeah.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two hands slammed the table hard. Because of the vibration it created, the tea I took the trouble of making almost spilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are noisy, idol woman.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack says at the opposite seat.</p><br/><p>This girl, she is chewing on the slice of lemon that was accompanying the tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cShow etiquette in a tea party. Wasn\u2019t your outward appearance your only good point?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cShat up, shemale! In a place like this, I would forget my manners and etiquette!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The water hero, Celestis-san, hits the table going *ban ban ban!*.</p><br/><p>How surprising. I thought she was a more rational person.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It was unexpected. I thought the light hero was a girl with a bit more common sense than this.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t it fine? In the times when something crazy happens, anyone would want to call their friends over to talk about it.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are going to call people, call the ones that are <i>close,</i> please! Don\u2019t go gathering people that you need to call with an ethereal wireless phone and takes half a day to arrive with a flying machine!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s tea party members.</p><br/><p>First, there\u2019s me, the light hero, Kourin Karen; next, there\u2019s the fire hero that is based at the neighboring Muspelheim, Katack Mirack-chan; and lastly, the water hero that is based even further than that at Hydra Ville, Celestis-san.</p><br/><p>Those are the three here.</p><br/><p>As heroes, we have similar worries and interests, so I thought that we would have many things in common to talk about, and tried calling them here.</p><br/><p>Since the time we defeated the Great Sea Dragon in Hydra Ville, we have understood each other\u2019s hearts, so I thought it would be nice to open up at least once and have a talk.</p><br/><p>And so, it leads to the present.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uhm, Karen-chi, it is true that I have suspended my idol activities since the trouble with the Great Sea Dragon, so my schedule has opened up slightly, but we are already planning on resuming activities. The first live for my return has already been decided, and with my motivation rising, I was itching to do some rehearsals, you know?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations. I will send you flowers in the day of your live!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if some flowers will be sufficient! Calling me just to have a damn talk when I am super busy with rehearsals and meetings! If you yourself don\u2019t appear as a guest, the cost and return won\u2019t match!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>You are so energetic, Celestis-san.</p><br/><p>If someone were not filled with this much energy, they most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to do something as taxing as being a hero and idol at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you okay with being called here, Mirack-chan?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026what are you saying, Karen? Do you think I wouldn\u2019t move once called by you?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Mirack-chan sips her tea sonorously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, isn\u2019t that something you ask <i>before </i>you call a person over?\u201d, is the retort of Celestis-san that I ignored.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, weren\u2019t you given strict orders by the Fire Church to not move from the base?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Because she has been visiting Apollon City too much lately, the Fire Founder-sama and many others were angered by it.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t able to accompany us in the search of the Underworld Country due to this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it okay already? Was your restriction lifted?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Karen. Who the hell do you think I am? You are talking to the one that\u2019s boasted as the strongest within the heroes, the fire hero, Katack Mirack, you know. I have long been prepared to be scolded!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not okay at all!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-san makes an intense retort in my stead.</p><br/><p>In this time when Haine-san is absent, she is quite the priceless treasure in this group.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Good grief. To think the fire hero and the light hero had such high quantities of crazy inside of them. This is way too surprising.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou as well, it is surprising that you have such a straight man side.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just that you two have way too much to retort about! Ah geez! I have been shouting so much that my throat has dried! Give me another serving of tea! Serve me one that has honey syrup that\u2019s gentle to the throat!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Yes yes, on my way.</p><br/><p>But this very situation of having heroes gathered like this with no pressing business and simply drinking tea, wouldn\u2019t have been possible a few months ago.</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan aimed to be the strongest and viewed the other heroes as her enemies, and Celestis-san was endeavouring in her idol activities so the other heroes were not even in her view.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So, that tough guy-kun, where is he?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden question of Celestis-san made me stop my hands that were pouring tea from the pot.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things that you would call us to complain about are limited, right? Things related to monsters and the church, and things that you wouldn\u2019t want to leak to the general populace. Also, the cool guy that you have been together with all the time lately is nowhere to be seen today of all days. It is way too clear that it has something to do with this, you know.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-san, contrary to your looks, you are actually intelligent.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I leave already?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>No no, I won\u2019t let you go.</p><br/><p>I have been given the chance to talk, so I will have them hear everything I have to say.</p><br/><p>From there on, my words flowed out fluently.</p><br/><p>I will have Mirack-chan and Celestis-san hear about how Haine-san left me behind, without leaving a single detail.</p><ul><li>101: If</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cMother Monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>After spitting out all that was accumulated in me, Mirack-chan and Celestis-san both showed equally bewildered expressions.</p><br/><p>As if saying, \u2018Unbelievable\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious? If that story is actually true, that\u2019s way too incredible!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only if this thing called Mother Monster actually exists, right? Wouldn\u2019t it mean that if we just defeat those guys, monsters won\u2019t be born again?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. It means that we would be able to completely eliminate the monsters that have been a harm to humans for close to a century.</p><br/><p>And our Haine-san went out to defeat them. Leaving me behind, he went all on his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cWah~, I did think he was an incredible dude, but this Haine-chi is more than I imagined. To think he would be able to catch the existence of such a thing.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has a part of him that no one can measure after all. I have never been able to predict what he will do next.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, Haine-san is amazing.</p><br/><p>As expected of the person I love. But that\u2019s the very reason why\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this! Why didn\u2019t he let me help him?! I am a hero, you know. If it\u2019s about doing something about the monsters, I should be the one moving to action!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSimmer down, Karen-chi, simmer down~~!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-san tries to calm me down as if I am a horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren, what did Haine tell you that made you stay here?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2019the duty of a hero is to protect the people from monsters. Properly staying in the capital to enforce this is important\u2019, he said.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a sound argument?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to hear that from Mirack-chan who comes to other cities with the resolve of getting scolded by the Founder-san and the others just to have fun.</p><br/><p>I was the one who called her here though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with this group of people that I can\u2019t find enough words to retort to?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-san, who was filling up the straight man role in Haine-san\u2019s absence plenty well, was shuddering.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou girls, even if you can fly wherever you want with that flying machine of yours, aren\u2019t you moving around way too much? I think heroes should be standing by, prepared to act for the sake of the church and the people. Haine-chi may have been late in noticing this, but he has now.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if we defeat the Mother Monsters, there would be no need to do that anymore, right?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The mission Haine-san left to accomplish had enough power to completely flip around the situation in this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026you two\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>At this moment, I decided on asking the question I have been holding until now.</p><br/><p>Mother Monsters. The moment the existence of something like that was made clear, a question was born inside of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf monsters disappear from this world, what would you do?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d \u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being thrown that question, Mirack-chan and Celestis-san looked as if they were caught off guard.</p><br/><p>We are heroes.</p><br/><p>The duty of heroes is to fight monsters. Fight monsters and protect the people; we continue doing this forever. There\u2019s no end to it.</p><br/><p>If I had to mention an end in it, it would be when we run out of stamina or physical strength; till the moment we are unable to continue fighting.</p><br/><p>In that way, several heroes in the past have taken over the standard, and have inherited the title of hero.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s only because there are monsters in this world.</p><br/><p>Heroes exist in order to oppose the threat called monsters. Putting it in another way, once monsters are gone, the heroes won\u2019t be needed anymore.</p><br/><p>Haine-san is a strong and incredible person. On top of that, he is kind, cool, intelligent, sincere, and once he says something, he will definitely accomplish it.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s him, he might be able to eradicate the monsters from this world.</p><br/><p>But, when that happens, what will we do?</p><br/><p>The great exploit Haine-san is trying to accomplish might take away our whole raison d\u2019etre.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm~, well, when that happens, we heroes will be going to the trash bin.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Looks like Celestis-san reached the same conclusion. Moreover, her expression was dry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really mind.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you know, once I am out of the hero profession, I can just concentrate in being an idol. From the very beginning, I was not thinking about living a life of being only a hero.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The water hero is strong.</p><br/><p>It is true that Celestis-san, who is wearing both pair of shoes for a hero and an idol, has that kind of choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is fine for people like me who can fall onto something, but the people that can\u2019t\u2026might be quite pitiful~.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t mind, you know.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Celestis-san send a malicious gaze towards Mirack-chan, but it seems Mirack-chan also isn\u2019t adhered to being a hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about the original reason I aimed for when becoming a hero, there\u2019s no need to be a hero for eternity, that\u2019s all there\u2019s to it. If monsters disappear from this world completely\u2026it might be nice to aim at being the strongest among all humans. It could be more of a heated competition than fighting against those brainless monsters.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa\u2026battle junkie.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, if I am not tied down by the duty of a hero, I can hang around Karen\u2019s place without restrain!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo in the end it falls to that!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-san and Mirack-chan had a mindset that was so free it was surprising.</p><br/><p>I see, there\u2019s no real need to continue being a hero.</p><br/><p>Before being a hero, I am a human, I am a girl. This goes for Celestis and Mirack as well.</p><br/><p>If I were to stop being a hero, what kind of new life should I walk?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Haine-san\u2019s wife.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d \u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Why didn\u2019t I notice such a splendid life plan until now?</p><br/><p>By the way, the number one reason for heroes retiring is marriage\u2026in other words, a congratulatory retirement.</p><br/><p>For some reason, there\u2019s a weird law in this world stating that heroes have to be single, so once I marry Haine-san, I would have to stop being a hero.</p><br/><p>In that case, in the time I retire as a hero, wouldn\u2019t it be best if the root of all evils was eliminated?</p><br/><p>Without leaving a single trace behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. In the first place, the duty of us heroes is to protect the people from monsters. And the ultimate duty would be to eradicate monsters itself. Why should we hesitate after learning the way to do that?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, before that, wait a bit, Karen. Did you say something about marrying? Eh?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>For some reason, Mirack-chan suddenly got restless.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, this is no time to be drinking tea! Defeating the Mother Monsters is the ultimate duty of us heroes! We can\u2019t leave it all to Haine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, that\u2019s good and all but, about the marrying thing\u2026 about the marrying thing!! Are you going to marry, Karen? With who?! I think you said Haine\u2026 There must be something wrong with my ears. Definitely!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Haine-san, as I thought, I will be going as well.</p><br/><p>I will help Haine-san, defeat the Mother Monsters, and bring about a world where the people all over the world won\u2019t have to fear for their lives!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, listen to me! Listen to me, Karen! What\u2019s this about marrying?! That\u2019s not true, right?! No way that\u2019s true!\u201d (Mirack)</p><ul><li>102: Could it be\u2026</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cSo, where did Haine-chi travel to?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The calm retort of Celestis-san deflates all of my inflated tension.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t know.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore he left, I asked him a lot, but he didn\u2019t tell me. He said that I would definitely follow him if he were to tell me!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd isn\u2019t that completely true? As expected of Haine-chi, his intuition is Godlike.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t say that as if it\u2019s someone else\u2019s business.</p><br/><p>We got all enthusiastic and, in the end, we are unable to make the first step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut thinking about it like this, there\u2019s something that bothers me.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What is it?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the world is Haine-chi?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t understand the question of Celestis-san right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Haine-san is Haine-san though?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is not the kind of \u2018I think therefore I am\u2019\u2026 You know, don\u2019t you feel like that guy is way too excelling in a lot of meanings? I have not seen it myself, but he has a rare power called dark element, right?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, Celestis-san has not had the chance to see it yet, but Haine-san is a person that doesn\u2019t fall into any of the elements known in this world.</p><br/><p>That power of his is overwhelming, and the dark element Haine-san creates managed to block a high-temperature flash, could beat up the giant fire cow, and even turned it calf-sized. It even easily defeated the shadow-san that the light element was unable to scratch at all.</p><br/><p>It was not Haine-san himself, but when the Great Sea Dragon attacked Hydra Ville and had released a tsunami on the level that could destroy the whole city, the mysterious dark giant-san created a weir with dark matter and reduced the damage on the city to zero.</p><br/><p>If we think of Haine-san as the only human recorded in history that can utilize dark matter, calling this power rare wouldn\u2019t be enough to describe how important it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-chi himself acted completely normal, so we also acted normal about it, but you know, in reality, isn\u2019t his very existence something big enough to turn around the very principle of the five churches? What was it again? That uhm\u2026Dark God, Entrocko?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cDark God, Entropy-sama.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that weird sounding name?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. When I heard that from you girls, I was thinking \u2018what kind of ridiculous thing is this woman saying?\u2019, but\u2026that Dark Giant that appeared in the fight with the Great Sea Dragon, isn\u2019t that proof of the existence of that God? Such a truth like there being six Gods of Creation rather than five, that\u2019s on the level of rewriting history, you know.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. If Haine-san feels like it, he would be able to flip the world around to its very foundations.</p><br/><p>No, in reality, he is trying to turn it around at this very moment. If Haine-san defeats the Mother Monsters, the world will change with Haine-san at its centre.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuromiya Haine. Now that I think about it, he is one mysterious man. It feels as if he doesn\u2019t belong to any part of the world, and it feels\u2026as if the world will be revolving around him.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Is what Mirack-chan says.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>The two of them are now friends. Friends that have overcome life or death situations together with me, and heroes that can share doubts and worries with each other.</p><br/><p>It is exactly because they are my friends that I decided on revealing the feeling that has been lurking inside of me for some time now.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, this is just for argument\u2019s sake. Just for argument\u2019s sake\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Celestis-san probably noticed the low tone I had, they both stayed silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if Haine-san himself is the Dark God Entropy?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were suddenly at a loss of words and had a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cK-Karen-chan, want a bite of my chiffon cake?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can also eat some of my super spicy walleye pollack roe cake.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Saying this, they both offer me their plates.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease stop it! Don\u2019t act so blatantly considerate to me! Also, Mirack-chan, I wouldn\u2019t want to eat a cake that would burn my mouth anyways!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I was stupid for trusting these two!</p><br/><p>Treating me like a pitiful girl that has some loose screws!!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, you crazy woman! In that case, let me say this. No matter how impressive his power is, there\u2019s no way a human is a God!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I said \u2018for argument\u2019s sake\u2019, didn\u2019t I! It is not as if I was confident about it when I said it! Celestis-chan, you should at least understand that on your own!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The tension got so high that my tone of voice towards Celestis-chan got rough.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether you are confident about it or not, there\u2019s a limit to what can be brought as a topic of conversation! We are in outline affiliated to the Church! Gods are the most esteemed existences for us, you know! Even if it\u2019s just for a hypothetical situation of yours, there\u2019s no way a God would just be walking around!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra ara, it is noisy here-desu wa ne.\u201d</p><br/><p>Our dispute must have been pretty tough for the ears.</p><br/><p>The door of the parlor room opened, and a peerless beauty entered the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Yorishiro-sama!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFounder?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Light Church Founder, Yorishiro-sama.</p><br/><p>Hearing that name, Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan jumped up from their seats and stood upright.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead and continue as you were. Is it a tea party between heroes? Deepening your friendship is a great thing, isn\u2019t it.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Yorishiro-sama smiles, and at the side of that smiling Yorishiro, there\u2019s a dark skin girl of around 14-15 years old.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so Doraha-san is with you.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood day, light hero-sama.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Doraha-san gave a polite greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, good day.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The identity of the shadow that we met at the Dark Underworld Country, Doraha-san.</p><br/><p>When she was just released from the shadow, she couldn\u2019t speak at all and was practically an infant, but after spending her days in Apollon City, her mental capacity recovered at a visible rate, and now, she is already at a level where even if she is standing at the side of Yorishiro-sama as her bodyguard, no one would find it strange.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the monument that she left behind at the Underworld Country, she must have originally been an intelligent girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if it\u2019s okay with Yorishiro-sama and Doraha-san, how about joining us?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry, I have a meeting I have to attend to. I need to have a talk with the Cardinal and the others about how they are not doing the amount of work that\u2019s fit for their position, and have a discussion about how they are already too old for this\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I see!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Since the time Yorishiro-sama returned from the Underworld Country, it felt like some sort of switch was flipped. She is trying to sweep the decay that has been spreading for a long while in the Light Church.</p><br/><p>Haine-san described it as: \u2018her olden blood stirring\u2019, but I didn\u2019t really understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, the fire hero Mirack-san and the water hero Celestis-san, think of this Light Grand Church as your own headquarters and relax, okay?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m honored!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Kay! I mean, thank you very much!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan were completely stiff in front of Yorishiro-sama.</p><br/><p>Once the door to the parlor room was closed, they both instantly let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I was so scared, seriously scared. So that\u2019s the infamous Light Founder, Yorishiro-sama huh.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not my first time meeting her, but that mysterious aura she has is not something one can get used to. The rumor that a person dies every time she smiles must be true.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The people outside were talking in such a way of Yorishiro-sama?!</p><br/><p>Even though she is actually a really good person\u2026 Next time, let\u2019s have Yorishiro-sama join us in our tea party.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Wait, the conversation derailed just now. As I was saying, there\u2019s no way a God would be walking around just like that, you know! As if it would be so easy to encounter a God!!\u201d (Celestis)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-98-99-divine-virtue-of-mother-earth\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 98-99 - Divine Virtue of Mother Earth\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-103-104-hero-alliance\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 103-104 - Hero Alliance\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236287\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

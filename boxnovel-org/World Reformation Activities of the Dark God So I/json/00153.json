This is my Mother Monster, Beelzebub.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Mother Monster?! That black smoke?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t describe it in any other way.</p><br/><p>From afar, it only looks like a black cloud; from up close, it looks like black smoke.</p><br/><p>It is not impossible, but it is a gaseous-like body that doesn\u2019t look like a living being at all. Even if they are classified as monsters, aren\u2019t they supposed to be connected to living beings somehow or another?</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the same time as they can give birth to wind element monsters, I also had them take on the role of hiding and protecting Rudras Metropolis. In other words, that is the Wind Barrier. Even if there\u2019s travelers encountering the Wind capital by coincidence, these guys won\u2019t allow them to enter unless allowed!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cMaking use of every goddamn thing! The humans, the city, the ethereal, and the monsters as well; you are utilizing them all as much as you want!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder about that. But that ends today. These guys will devour everything after all!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>The black smoke rushes in wave towards me with the order of Shiva.</p><br/><p>My instincts were telling me that being bathed by that would definitely be bad news.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I faced that thing straight on.</p><br/><p>I release dark matter, and with the same level of wave, I clash it with the black smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that black smoke is, but it looks like it doesn\u2019t have the power to fight straight on against the dark matter. I can feel the divine power is being erased!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but what about the others aside from you?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Something came to mind, and I face the side.</p><br/><p>And then, what came to view were the heroes that were being attacked by the black smoke in the same way as me, and the Founders as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I quickly ran towards them.</p><br/><p>I will be distancing myself from Shiva in this way, but now that things have turned like this, I have no choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaa!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat-dasu?! What-dasu?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, it is certain that touching that thing will be dangerous! [Flame Burst]!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The large fire that Mirack released had burned the place where the black smoke is, and it hindered its advance.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, the Founders and heroes are currently okay.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I also ran towards the group and release dark matter at the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack! It looks like my power and yours is effective against this black smoke! The two of us will take one side each and block them out completely!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!! But this smoke, since the fire element is effective against it, could it be that it is something wind element related?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Based on the element affinities, fire is the one that\u2019s strong against wind.</p><br/><p>Fire will breathe in the air, increase in potency, and with that heat, it disturbs the flow of the wind.</p><br/><p>In our first encounter with Mirack, I remember her burning all the wind element monsters -Python Flies- with one attack.</p><br/><p>And so, the same thing happening here serves as a strengthening statement towards this black smoke actually being the Wind Mother Monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what this smoke is! As long as we don\u2019t clarify the identity of it, don\u2019t touch it by no means!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say identity, but how are we even going to identify it?! From what I can see, aside from it moving as if it has a will of its own, it seriously just looks like smoke, you know?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The fastest way would be to ask Shiva himself, but that guy is still at the center of the ring, and was simply looking at us with a grin on his face.</p><br/><p>Mirack is releasing fire and I am releasing dark matter without pause, but the smoke is also coming down nonstop from the main body -the black cloud.</p><br/><p>As long as we don\u2019t burn it or erase it, we will be at a stalemate here.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the Wind Founder doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know who said it, but that is a natural question.</p><br/><p>Only the Wind Founder Shiva was not doing anything and simply standing on the ring, but he is completely fine. It doesn\u2019t look like the black smoke is doing anything to him.</p><br/><p>But that doesn\u2019t mean we would get positive and think that we will be fine as well.</p><br/><p>Unless you are extremely dense, you would definitely notice that this abnormality has something to do with the Wind Founder.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, what is the Wind Founder trying to do?! Just what in the world is this black smoke?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>And that question being directed at me who was fighting with the Wind Founder is also natural.</p><br/><p>We were talking for quite a bit after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, well\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>But as expected, I couldn\u2019t tell them the reality straight. There\u2019s no way I can tell them that the Wind Founder is the Wind God himself, and he suddenly became despaired, and is now trying to suicide together with the world.</p><br/><p>While I was hurting myself on what to say\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, Karen-san\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro speaks in good timing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe light divine power is not simply a power that destroys enemies with light. If that were the case, it would be no different from the fire divine power.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama? What is it, all of a sudden?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cGather your light divine power to your eyelids and try to strain your eyes. The eyes are an instrument to catch the reflected light and grasp the surroundings. By increasing the accuracy of the information received by this reflected light with divine power\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Like this?! Kyaaaa!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Did she see something by doing what Yorishiro suggested?</p><br/><p>Karen-san lets out a scream fitting her age.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Karen, what happened?! \u2026\u2026.Damn it, at times like this, to think I can\u2019t move from my place!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get caught by your wicked desires and continue putting out a fire wall, lesbo hero!! So Karen-chi, what happened?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Karen-san answers Celestis with a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis black smoke\u2026this black smoke is\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cBugs.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like they are some sort of flies-desu wa ne. But they are incredibly small. They are even smaller than grains of sand. And there\u2019s several millions of flies swarming around. That\u2019s the true identity of this black smoke.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaa?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I unintentionally let out my voice at the words of Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>In other words, this black smoke is actually a gathering of incredibly small insects?!</p><br/><p>\u201cNuooooooooooooo!!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the strength of Mirack\u2019s fire increases even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>At some point in time, Shiva had arrived at a place close to us.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wind Mother Monster, Beelzebub. Its identity is that of a swarm of super small fly-shaped monsters. They are a gathering of around a hundred billion, but the monster itself is only one. It is a group, and yet, it is only one kind of monster. By dispersing to the surroundings, they lay eggs all around, and wind monsters are born from it.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>This guy is saying such essential stuff in front of everyone\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cRiding the wind, they appear, swarming on rotten meat, they use that as a sacrifice to lay eggs, and change them to a new life. Life is born from filth. And the one that embodies this the most is the fly army, Beelzebub. By the hands of them, the world will meet its end today!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><ul><li>154: Baal Cloud</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cWhat be the meaning of this-sa ne, Wind Founder?\u201d</p><br/><p>The very first one to voice out was the Earth Founder Obaa-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Founder controlling a monster, I can only think of it as a bad joke. But if ya say it be the Mother Monster we been discussing about, that makes it the more doubting-sa ne.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hmph.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva simply made a villainous smile.</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Is that supposed to be him scorning us?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just stay silent and answer!\u201d (Azul)</p><br/><p>Even the Water Founder. As expected, he forgot his usual gentleness and lifted his voice.</p><br/><p>{\u2026Founder! Founder! I request a response!}</p><br/><p>From the ear of the Water Founder, I heard an unfamiliar voice.</p><br/><p>It came from the ethereal wireless communication device at his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Stream Marine General? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d (Azul)</p><br/><p>So they had communication with the outside through the wireless device?</p><br/><p>The call was probably from the troops that were in standby outside Rudras Metropolis.</p><br/><p>{It is an emergency! The cloud! The black cloud that was covering the sky has come down the ground, and\u2014!!}</p><br/><p>?!!</p><br/><p>I look at the sky. There, I saw that the line that was connecting the black cloud to the ground\u2026 was not a single line anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2014?! The soldiers at standby outside are also being attacked?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The only thing that we have to understand what\u2019s happening outside is the voice that\u2019s telling us about it from the wireless device.</p><br/><p>Moreover, that voice was trembling with fear and confusion.</p><br/><p>{The cloud\u2026 turned into smoke\u2026a black smoke, and is closing onto us. It was eerie, so we fought back, but against smoke, the expected effect is not showing, and a few of the people at the frontline that touched the smoke\u2026have been covered completely by it, and\u2014!!}</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiiih?!\u201d</p><br/><p>We, who knew about the real identity of the smoke, let out screams.</p><br/><p>&lt;More than ten have fallen victim to it. With their whole body covered by the smoke, they fell writhing in pain\u2026.! Eh? Wait a moment please! The smoke is backing off from the fallen people, and\u2026!!&gt;</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>{Great! I don\u2019t know why, but it looks like the smoke has pulled back on its own! Are you okay?! Medic! Just in case, check out the people that have been attacked by the smok\u2014GAhaaagh?!}</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?! What was that?! A scream?! What happened?! Respond!\u201d (Azul)</p><br/><p>For a while, only the sound of chaos reverberated from the wireless device.</p><br/><p>{Founder! This is terrible! The people that were caught in the smoke and were now released from it, have suddenly begun attacking us!! There\u2019s no response even when we call out to them! The black smoke is also slowly approaching again! Orders please!! Orde\u2014-Gugyaa!}</p><br/><p>After that, no matter how many times the Water Founder called, the only thing that was returned from the wireless device were screams and bellows.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Shiva!!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I also let out an angry roar at Shiva.</p><br/><p>With absolute certainty that he is the one who is responsible for this abnormal circumstances.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What Beelzebub is aiming for\u2026is the insides of you humans.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>He replied with a tone as if he were teaching pitiful lost lambs.</p><br/><p>\u201cSticking onto the humans, they enter through places like the mouth, nose, ears; at every possible hole to invade the body. Entering the lungs, passing through the veins, and at the end, they arrive at the brain. A single one of Beelzebub is as big as 1/10 of a grain of sand. There\u2019s no problem in invading the body with that size. Then, once it arrives at the brain, it takes over their thoughts and\u2026\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>As if edging the shock even deeper, he stored it before saying it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It can freely control them.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, the reason why the soldiers suddenly attacked their comrades was\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Because they were already the puppets of the flies.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not all, you know? After all, the most important point of Beelzebub is that they are a Mother Monster. They have the function of laying eggs that give birth to wind element monsters. The brain of a human must be quite the nutritious place as a seedbed, don\u2019t you think so too?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2014!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c Fighting in this place, have all the humans be parasitized by Beelzebub, and just like that, I will have them return to their homelands. By the time they arrive, all their bodies should be filled with eggs. In time, they will hatch, tear away the host, and grow. The very center of the settlements will be covered by several hundreds of wind element monsters. Moreover, by that time, the Founders and heroes will have been turned into seedbeds as well and already be dead.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cDisgusting-dasu~~~!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan couldn\u2019t endure it and lets out a groan. That\u2019s how much the explanation of Shiva must have been displeasing in a physiological way.</p><br/><p>So for those things, we are all only egg-laying containers huh.</p><br/><p>Not only will we be killed\u2026they plan on parasitizing us as living corpses!</p><br/><p>{Founder-sama!! 1/10 of the troops stationed here have fallen to the control of the mysterious smoke! What should we do? Please give us orders!!}</p><br/><p>At times, there would be understandable voices coming from the communication device, voices that were at their wit\u2019s end.</p><br/><p>Even if they are being controlled, they are comrades. They probably can\u2019t attack them without hesitating.</p><br/><p>As they continue in that state, the situation progresses.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it has come to this\u2026!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I resolve myself.</p><br/><p>But Shiva was a breath faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shiva\u2019s body was obstructed by the black smoke, and just like that, he disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe ran away?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The most effective way of dealing with this swarm of flies is to defeat Shiva who is the one controlling them.</p><br/><p>This black smoke that is made up of minuscule flies; each one of them may be small, but if the numbers are in the billions, the whole of them is close to being as big as the giant tree, Grandma Wood.</p><br/><p>After all, the black cloud, that can be said to be the parent body, is covering the sky as far as the eye can see, and even when it has poured quite the amount to the ground, its denseness hasn\u2019t changed at all.</p><br/><p>If we just continue as we are -blocking them with Mirack\u2019s fire and my dark matter- it is clear that it will turn into us exhausting ourselves.</p><br/><p>And worst than that, the casualties the soldiers outside are receiving is serious.</p><br/><p>Toreido Shiva\u2026 Wind God Quasar.</p><br/><p>Are you seriously aiming to destroy the world using the Mother Monster?</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-150-152-a-wrath-of-a-hundred-million-days\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 150-152 - A wrath of a hundred million days\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-155-156-the-way-to-carry-out-one%E2%80%99s-duty\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 155-156 - The way to carry out one\u2019s duty\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236308\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

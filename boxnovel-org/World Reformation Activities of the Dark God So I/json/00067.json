Just a heads up :D!</p><hr/><br/><p>And that\u2019s how the alliance between the Light Church\u2019s Founder and the light hero was formed.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s fine anymore to call these two holy women.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo she says! Haine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Is what the hero that had been convinced by the Founder just a few moments ago said as she suddenly approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, everyone can be happy! Yorishiro-sama and I don\u2019t have to get rejected by Haine-san! There\u2019s nothing as great as this!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Ah, right.</p><br/><p>Karen-san has the trait of not being concerned about the rules of society, and is more about wishing for the happiness of everyone, that\u2019s why she became a hero -to protect the people.</p><br/><p>Her basic stance as a hero is that when she is given a choice like: \u2018sacrifice someone to save the world\u2019, she would go: \u2018I will save both!\u2019.</p><br/><p>This time also falls into that case\u2026probably.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, I am looking forward to working with you-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Let\u2019s pair our strengths to protect the Church and the people!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Founder and Hero; the leader of the Church and the face of it. In other words, it is like the position of a captain and the ace, which means both of them are connected by a strong bond, but\u2026of all things, the catalyst of it had to be\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, Karen-san, do you want to join in on our date?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Is that okay? Even though you finally have the chance to be alone with Haine-san?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs women that love Haine-san, trying to get ahead would be foul play. No matter the time and place, in sickness and in health, let\u2019s have Haine-san love us together.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have my respect, Yorishiro-sama! Ah, but I have some business to do\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is okay, let us accompany you in that. It is okay to do that as a date, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are kindness itself, Yorishiro-sama! It would help me a lot. To tell you the truth, I had something to consult with Yorishiro-sama and Haine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The two women, that are completely in sync, had left me behind and were advancing at their own pace.</p><br/><p>I was left there.</p><br/><p>It felt as if a tornado had just passed. Noisy and boisterous.</p><br/><p>Even though this is a library, even though this is the perfect spot for silence, we ended up making quite the noise.</p><br/><p>When I look at the surroundings, just as I thought, the gazes of the people here and the librarian-san were directed at me.</p><br/><p>Having their attention but still maintaining silence is painful in itself.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uhm, I am truly sorry for the noise.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I apologize and lower my head.</p><br/><p>But even without saying anything, the atmosphere in this place was clearly returning to me in words:</p><br/><p>\u2018Guilty or Not Guilty?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026GUILTY!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly sorry for the disturbance!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s not the thing you should be apologizing for.\u2019</p><br/><p>Is what the atmosphere was telling me.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>And so, I chased after the two as if running away and join up with them.</p><br/><p>It looks like Karen-san really did have something to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind right, Haine-san?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I gave my answer, but in this situation, I had no other choice for an answer anyways.</p><br/><p>Well, even if we continued the date as it is, we have gone through all the date spots that Frost recommended, and even with that, it is still too soon to return, so we were about to run out of things to do anyways.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s think of it as \u2018just in time\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, you came to the library because you had business there?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I have been going there lately, you know. There\u2019s something I wanted to investigate after all. Ah, but uhm\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laying down the conversation, Karen-san begins to fidget.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..Don\u2019t ignore what happened before, okay?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018What happened before\u2019?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe talk about me\u2026loving Haine-san! I don\u2019t mind you giving me an answer later, but leaving the confession itself as if it never happened would be incredibly troubling for me. I thoroughly used the female courage I normally don\u2019t use after all!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>She pinned it down!</p><br/><p>It is true that it was pushed by the alliance between these two and the confession was washed away, but it was incredibly important for her.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s a place for those kind of things, Karen-san.</p><br/><p>In this incredibly public space that is the library, there\u2019s quite the amount of onlookers.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for that, I would have lost to the passion of Karen-san and would have hugged her right then and there, but with Yorishiro there as well, more the reason why I couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Karen-san completely missed the concept of time and place, but she was still able to manage a confession in those circumstances.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if this is the courage she has as a hero, or the thing she called the female courage.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, until I hear an answer from Haine-san, I will be telling you \u2018I love you\u2019 everyday.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. I will do that too.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Even Yorishiro jumped on the wagon.</p><br/><p>Please spare me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, returning to the topic, my objective in coming to the library. I wanted to hear the opinion of Yorishiro-sama and Haine-san, so this is truly good timing.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro and I?</p><br/><p>Just what does Karen-san want to ask?</p><br/><p>\u201cI was currently investigating about the Dark God Entropy.\u201d (Karen)</p><ul><li>68: The God hidden in the books</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cDark God Entropy\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Hearing that name, I was perplexed.</p><br/><p>Because that God is the soul that\u2019s inside of me after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Since the time Yorishiro-sama told me about that God, I tried investigating about a lot of things on my own. This library was the best source of information I had.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other library as big as this no matter what part in this world you look at after all. If it\u2019s to investigate something, this is certainly a great place to do it.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro adds.</p><br/><p>In the Radona mountainous district where we had fought the fire cow Phalaris, I revealed for the first time my battle style with Dark Matter, and the questioning that came after was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro appeared in good timing and revealed the existence of the sixth God of Creation, the Dark God Entropy.</p><br/><p>In this world, aside from the Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, and Light element, there\u2019s also the dark element that composes this world as well, and there are really rare times when the dark element is thick inside humans.</p><br/><p>With that \u2018setting\u2019, we were able to convince Karen-san and Mirack about my Dark Matter.</p><br/><p>The reality is different though. Since the soul inside of me is the Dark God Entropy himself after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been bothered by it all this time. We have been worshipping the Gods of Creation for several centuries, and yet, I was now told that there\u2019s actually not only five but six. Don\u2019t you think this is an incredible revelation, Haine-san?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It is hard for me to understand how she feels since I knew from the very beginning\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if that\u2019s true, why is the Dark God not known like the other Gods? Why is he not being worshipped by anyone? The questions just keep popping up!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you were coming to the library, to investigate?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, and also\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san fidgets for a moment, and then, as if having resolved herself, she says,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the God that\u2019s connected with the person I love, so I got even more interested in it\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Uwa.</p><br/><p>Now that Karen-san has confessed once, she continuously keeps attacking without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that feeling, Karen-san. You want to learn all about the person you love after all.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Yorishiro-sama! And so, the information about this Dark God was brought to light by Yorishiro-sama, so I thought that maybe you knew more.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro says this looking truly sorry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know more than what the Light Goddess-sama had enlightened me with her oracle.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>And so the Light Goddess herself says\u2026</p><br/><p>Yorishiro and I are keeping it a secret that we are the reincarnation of Gods.</p><br/><p>It is obvious that we will be seen as megalomaniacs, and even if by some chance they were to believe us, it would only needlessly create disturbance in the world, and there\u2019s absolutely no good points about it.</p><br/><p>In the first place, I want to enjoy this world not as a God but as a human. Yorishiro probably thinks the same way.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, the God part inside of me is a secret that\u2019s okay not being known.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe oracle of the Light Goddess-sama must have been to let me know about the approach of the special existence that is Haine-san. She didn\u2019t tell me much.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>And I am impressed at how easily Yorishiro can lie. It is probably a necessary skill to hide her true nature as a God though.</p><br/><p>It is not the type that brings down people, so let\u2019s consider it as white lie.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Gods wish for the people to think by themselves. That\u2019s why, no matter what it is, they will only reveal a small part of it. Unveiling everything is the role of the people themselves.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 That\u2019s true. The things you wish for have to be grasped with your own hands!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>And Karen-san is a honest and good girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, I have researched on my own. I dug out as many old books from this library as possible, and read them from beginning to end. And then, when I found information that might be related to Entropy-sama, I would transcribe it, and this is what I got!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>*Don!!* is the sound that the notebook makes when it hits the table.</p><br/><p>It is incredibly worn out.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uhm, Karen-san, you learned about Entropy pretty recently, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Then, her investigation should have begun pretty recently, and yet, did she investigate so much that it ended up with her notebook getting this worn out?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, even if I say that, there hasn\u2019t been a single place that had a clear mention of Entropy-sama though. As expected of a hidden God that its existence has not been known at all until this present day. But\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san turns the front cover of the notebook.</p><br/><p>At the first page, there\u2019s cute writing that\u2019s most likely from Karen-san herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, there was darkness; in there, Inflation creates light; Quasar filled the sky with air; next, Mantle creates earth; Coacervate filled the earth\u2019s space with water; and at last, Nova melded it all into one with fire; and that\u2019s how the world was created.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one passage of the Genesis.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. But this part about \u2018first, there was darkness\u2019, isn\u2019t it strange? There\u2019s light, wind, earth, water, and wind; everything that the Gods made was clearly written there, and yet, darkness was empty right from the beginning. I didn\u2019t find it strange before, but now that I read it, I do feel something\u2019s off.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That\u2019s true\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis passage was probably rewritten, and before it was rewritten, this is what was there: \u2018First, Entropy created darkness\u2019.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s actually how it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were also other descriptions that were of interest. In the especially old books of this library, there\u2019s phrases like these appearing. \u2018Two poles, four base elements\u2019.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cMust be referring to the six Gods.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! As expected of Haine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Oops, should I have waited a bit more to give out that opinion?</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on the context throughout the book, these words should certainly be referring to the Gods of Creation, but there\u2019s five Gods of Creation, and yet, it is written \u2018two poles, four base elements\u2019, in that case, 2 plus 4 makes 6. The numbers don\u2019t match. But, if we count Entropy-sama in the math, it makes sense.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san really investigated well.</p><br/><p>In the six Gods of Creation, there were clear categories: the light and dark poles; and the earth, fire, water, and wind base elements. These two categories had a strong difference in high and low, but I who was one of the poles was defeated and sealed, so it became hazy.</p><br/><p>At any rate, I am impressed that Karen-san was able to investigate this much.</p><br/><p>I was sealed at the Genesis of the world, so it is natural that no one knows about me from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, rather than saying the books have been rewritten, it is more like, it shouldn\u2019t even exist to begin with. There\u2019s no way there would be details of the Dark God written anywhere.</p><br/><p>The most that can be achieved is to catch the scent of my possible existence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, I have one big reveal left for the last part.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s apparently people that worshipped the Dark God Entropy in the past.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeeh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way that\u2019s possible!</p><br/><p>\u201cI found a book that points out the place where they might have been living in. And its name is: The Dark Underworld Country.\u201d (Karen)</p><ul><li>69: Metropolis of Darkness</li></ul><br/><p>What is the meaning of this?!</p><br/><p>There were humans that worshipped me, the Dark God Entropy?!</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know about any of this. The person himself not knowing that he was being worshipped\u2026is that even possible?</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, please speak about this in more detail.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Being urged by Yorishiro, Karen-san continues.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dark Underworld country seems to be the city that the people, who worship the Dark God Entropy, build. It wasn\u2019t mentioned in any of the history or geography textbooks, but there was a poetry anthology of the long past that had mentioned this name.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san turns the pages of the notebook and a page filled with what\u2019s most definitely the writing of her was shown to us.</p><br/><p>Summarizing that poem, the evil people that worshipped the Dark God had been destroyed together with their city.</p><br/><p>The poem described it as \u2018the victory of justice and the defeat of evil\u2019, and sung it highly, but it could be described as being childishly written. It was on the level that I would understand why it would be buried at the very corners of the library.</p><br/><p>\u201cA poem huh. Compared to a book, this has a low level of credibility.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. As long as there\u2019s not something backing it, there\u2019s the possibility that this author wrote it based on its own fantasy. Also, I am a bit scared of this poem.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cScared?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis poem describes the Dark God as some sort of evil being that taints humans. If Entropy-sama really is such a bad God\u2026I really wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san was making a truly sad face.</p><br/><p>It was hard for me to say anything. As the person himself, I can\u2019t say if Entropy is truly good or evil. And I don\u2019t remember I did anything for this Dark land that was mentioned by this author.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way I would have been able to do anything, since I was sealed in that period of time.</p><br/><p>In the text of the poem, the only thing that\u2019s stated clearly is the name of the land, Underworld Country. I can\u2019t see a single part that mentions the name of the Dark God Entropy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ruler of Darkness\u2019, \u2018the Avatar of Wickedness\u2019; those were the only vague mentions there.</p><br/><p>As expected, this is the portrayal of the author\u2019s fantasy that matched with me by coincidence. It would be the most natural to accept this as just that, a coincidence\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go confirm it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Is the conclusion I reached to, but there was one person who said something outrageous.</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro?\u201d \u201cYorishiro-sama?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was wondering why she had been silent, but she actually came and threw in an explosive statement again.</p><br/><p>\u201cConfirm it, where?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, at the Dark Underworld country. The many questions you have will most likely have an answer when you go there.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Yorishiro-sama\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I stand on Karen-san\u2019s side in this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Underworld country is a mysterious city that we don\u2019t even know if it existed or not! Even if it actually does, it would be just like the poem has written it to be, destroyed and in ruins already. In the first place, we don\u2019t know where it is! Even if we tried to look for it, there\u2019s no clues\u2014\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s about that, there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro takes out something from her pocket. A small magnetic needle\u2026something like a compass.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is one of the secret treasures that have been passed down to the Founders of the Light Church, the \u2018Needle of Guidance\u2019.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Needle of Guidance\u2019?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis needle is made from the same material as the holy sword Saint-George that was granted to you, Karen-san. If you pour light divine power into it with the image of what you are looking for in your mind, it will point at a certain direction.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible! Then, if we pour divine power into this needle and imagine the Underworld country\u2026!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It will point at the direction the Underworld country is.</p><br/><p>It sounds like an incredibly convenient item. Way too convenient.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, if what you are looking for is way too far, or your image is way too vague, it won\u2019t point well at your destination. In order to search for it better, you would need to pour even more light divine power. To search for a place that you don\u2019t know where in the whole world it is and have never seen before, Karen-san, even if you place all your divine power into it, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Reality isn\u2019t that kind.</p><br/><p>The path that had opened was immediately closed, and the face of Karen-san clouds.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I will be going as well.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we pair your light divine power with mine, we would have enough to cover the whole world. Karen-san, in exchange of this sacred treasure and my divine power, in your search for the Dark Underworld country, can I also accompany you?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Thank you very much! Yorishiro-sama, how kind you are!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufu, we are already comrades in love, aren\u2019t we. It is a given to help each other.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The self-proclaimed comrades in love are holding hands and swinging them up and down</p><br/><p>No, wait. Doesn\u2019t that mean the hero and the Founder would be absent from the Light Church?</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you are uneasy about something, Haine-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t read my mind.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is okay. For the sake of this kind of times, I work hard everyday in order to maintain the remaining work to zero. So, in my absence, I will just have the Cardinal work as if his life is at stake.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t sacrifice the life force of someone else!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThose people don\u2019t usually work anyways, so this serves just fine.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>A black Yorishiro came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also fine. Just like the time when we went to Hydra Ville, as long as I have the flying machine, I can handle any situation in a timely manner! Okay, with this, things have been decided. Let\u2019s go, Haine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I look at Karen-san with a dumbfounded expression, and Karen-san looks back at me with a puzzled expression.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.Well, yeah\u2026I knew this would happen.</p><br/><p>I have to go together with them.

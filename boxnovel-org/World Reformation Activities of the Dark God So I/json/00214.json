He was still alive!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The disappointment of the heroes was serious.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lords didn\u2019t even consider them as enemies.</p><br/><p>The confidence of Karen-san and the others, after not even being seen as insects on the ground, was in shambles.</p><br/><p>Even though the previous heroes battle had been settled and we would be unified more from now on\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I want to do something to encourage them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought about that as I spoke out, but I was stopped by someone.</p><br/><p>The previous hero, Abi Kyouka.</p><br/><p>The previous heroes who fought similarly in that battlefield were also riding in this car.</p><br/><p>Excluding the light hero Sunnysol Ates, who had at some point in time disappeared, the remaining four heroes faced their respective juniors.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack, you are a splendid fire hero.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cSis\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The unexpected words of her senior made Mirack lift up her covered face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had become far stronger than the time I knew you. You stepped onto a domain that I don\u2019t know of. And after fighting together with you, I have personally felt it.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cReally. We be simply out of the times now~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>The previous earth hero, Yoneko-san, also speaks as she hugs her cousin, Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe era has separated into a completely different path ta one that ain\u2019t having nothing to do with past or current. As expected, being shut in the countryside makes ya unable ta tell what be going on with society. And it made me unable ta tell how desperately Sasae-chan be working.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cYoneko-neechan!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan had watery eyes while she was being crushed by the breasts of Yoneko-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is vexing to say, but I will be matching the opinions of the others here. Because it looks like the current trend is cooperation and harmony.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cQuack-senpai!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The high prided previous water hero still had her stubborn attitude left.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-san, you continue doing your best just like that. Since it looks like if you don\u2019t do your best, my celebrity lifestyle will be in danger as well. So I have no choice but to cheer you on.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks! As expression of gratitude, I will send a signed color paper to your house with the name of your husband!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, I hate this person!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The previous and current water heroes were both as they always are.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister-in-law will be rooting for you.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! I will defeat you before the Demon Lords!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>And the wind previous and current heroes were even more as usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Looking at this spectacle, Karen-san says this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time for us to be losing heart. Heroes are everyone\u2019s expectation, hope. Even if we are defeated, we can\u2019t just stand still!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Little by little, strength was returning to her voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. No matter how strong I am, that is something I can\u2019t do. That is something only Karen-san and the others can do. Become the hope of everyone, lift them up, and turn into their strength to walk.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>That is the strength of the heroes, that is the meaning of heroes. The reason why the heroes are the strongest.</p><br/><p>Everyone here possesses that power. No matter the element, no matter if they are past or present.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe previous heroes will declare this here and now! We agree to your Hero Alliance!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Kyouka represented them and lifts up her voice in this cramped car.</p><br/><p>The other previous heroes also nod in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s something we can do to help, we won\u2019t neglect our assistance in it! We have just been taught the scariness of the Demon Lords. Now that we have understood the urgency of the situation, we can\u2019t just be taking it easy simply because we have already retired! But right now, it is your era! You people are the main cast!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe be supporting ya people from the shadows~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you people are too disappointing, we will be taking the position though.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cHiding in the shadows\u2026\u2026that\u2019s a nice relaxing position for me.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>This is the only positive effect that I felt from the appearance of the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>That is, in the face of an enormous enemy, the sense of unity from everyone has been strengthened even more.</p><br/><p>Adding to that, there was also the previous and current heroes match that also deepened their understandings with each other.</p><br/><p>The world, that had been apart before the match, is now increasing more and more in unity.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The car had arrived at Rudras Metropolis.</p><br/><p>I want to have Karen-san and the others, who have overcome a series of battles, take a rest.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, I had stepped out of the car first and was met with something unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, come out and see.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is amazing.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>There was a mountain of people.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only the people that were spectating the previous and current heroes match at the dome. There were also regular citizens of Rudras Metropolis.</p><br/><p>Everyone was watching the battle from the far-sighted camera.</p><br/><p>The victory that all the heroes of the earth, water, fire, wind, and light had obtained by fighting together has moved everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks! Hero-samas, thank you!\u201d \u201cWe owe all of you our lives!\u201d \u201cWatching you join strengths in battle moved me!\u201d \u201cHurrah on friendship!\u201d \u201cIt is the time for the five churches to join as one!\u201d</p><br/><p>The heroes that came out from the car one after the other were showered by this welcoming.</p><br/><p>I could tell that their hearts, that had been cooled by the terrifying power of the Demon Lords, were being warmed by this encouragement.</p><br/><p>Their cheeks were flushing by that warmth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a triumphant return!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. The return of Karen-san and the others was exactly that. One of triumph.</p><br/><p>They returned after a victory.</p><br/><p>They probably have begun feeling inside of them that they have actually won.</p><br/><p>The long previous and new heroes battle, and then the Slime battle that began not long after; overcoming them all, this was the moment that rewarded Karen-san and the others.</p><ul><li>215: Freebie</li></ul><br/><p>There were the women looking at the shining moment of the heroes from a step back.</p><br/><p>The previous heroes.</p><br/><p>\u201cShowered in praise with all five heroes gathered huh. This is a spectacle that we wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine in our era.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it be a nice sight~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is certain that the era has changed. But I do have the feeling that it has progressed. At the very least it wasn\u2019t a regression.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Too bright. It hurts.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Heroes compete and quarrel with each other; these girls lived in an era where such things were natural.</p><br/><p>They once rebuked their juniors who tried to change that perception, but now it looks like a different view of it has begun to sprout inside of them.</p><br/><p>That sprout can be considered a worthy harvest in today\u2019s battle.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I will be returning now then~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! Already?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The current heroes were busy interacting with the people, so I took the role of stopping her.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI left mah husband and older children at the countryside after all~. I already be in a mood where I be missing \u2018em so much I can\u2019t endure it anymore~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>The heroes that have already retired have their own family to mind now.</p><br/><p>Today they pushed themselves to participate. We have to let them return to where they belong.</p><br/><p>But then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Yoneko, Yoneko!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A throaty voice was calling the name of Yoneko-san somewhere.</p><br/><p>I was wondering that as I look around and\u2026a robust man was approaching here?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAra!! Why are ya at a place like this?!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>Yoneko-san made a happy expression as she jumped onto the man. And then, without minding about being in public, they kiss!</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026could it be that you are the husband of Yoneko-san?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Judging from the situation, that\u2019s the only thing it can be.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Ya were supposed to be staying at the house. What happened?!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>The husband-san that I could even confuse for a bear was making an embarrassed expression and gesture that didn\u2019t match his big frame.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoneko, soon after you left, the children began getting rowdy, you see. I was also getting so lonely I couldn\u2019t endure it, so I ended up chasing after you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d \u201cMommy!\u201d</p><br/><p>From the back of the big man, two children peek their faces out. From what I see, they are completely twins.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven ya two! I be so glad. Mama couldn\u2019t live without seeing ya~! Danna-sama &lt;husband&gt; as well! I will go get the little one from Sobo-chan right now~! With that, all the family will be reunited~!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>Yoneko-san looks incredibly happy.</p><br/><p>I see. I heard that Yoneko-san had given birth to her third child after around 1 year of having married, but the first two were twins huh.</p><br/><p>When I heard about it, I was heavily disconcerted by the math not matching but if it\u2019s twins\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026..It still doesn\u2019t match?!</p><br/><p>\u201cSarasa! The rose that blooms in my heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Danna-sama!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>What is it now?!</p><br/><p>When I turn around to check the vigorous voice that came from another direction, I see a handsome man with a kaiser moustache hugging Sarasa-san!</p><br/><p>\u201cDanna-sama! Why are you here? I left the house without prior notice, and yet, why?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Sarasa!! I didn\u2019t know you were so tormented by this!! I need you! Even if it was a political marriage, right now for me, you are a heavenly flower in full bloom! A pearl shining in the ocean! Even if I were to conquer the seven seas, I wouldn\u2019t be able to find a treasure as valuable as you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026that\u2019s the husband of Sarasa that was obsessed with idols?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have apologized to father in your sted. Everything is my fault. I won\u2019t be divorcing you by no means. Will you please return together with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, then Danna-sama! Will you be holding back your idol hobbies from now on?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! You are my greatest treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will stop buying idol goods as well, right?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will cut it off completely! \u2026No, how about leaving it at half the pace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will also not go to the live performance next week and will pass the time with me, right?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what about the ticket I already bought?!\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, I feel a storm coming.</p><br/><p>And just at that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHeya~! The idol hero Celestis appears like a maelstrom! You are the husband-sama that is always cheering for me, right? Thank you very much!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first time I talk to Celes-tan in the flesh!!!!!!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith what kind of timing did you decide on coming?! Go away this instant!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>It felt like the storm won\u2019t be leaving anytime soon, so I averted my eyes.</p><br/><p>The husbands of the previous heroes huh.</p><br/><p>They were worried about their wife and secretly came here to cheer for them huh.</p><br/><p>Well, they must hold an important place in their heart. I can understand how they feel.</p><br/><p>Is what I thought when\u2026huh? There\u2019s an unknown young man where Kyouka-san is.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Why did you come here too? You have your work at the inn.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I was worried about Kyouka-san. It is natural for a couple, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her junior Mirack was looking at the man and woman pairing with her pointed finger trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Sis Kyouka? W-Who is the man there?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, so you didn\u2019t know? He is my husband. We married last month, you see.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Oi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment please! Sis had been defeated by the Fire Cow Phalaris, so you retired from being a hero and was training all this time in order to vindicate your honor, and had just returned!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. That\u2019s why, in the middle of my training, I by chance stayed in the inn he managed. From there on, a lot of things happened, you see.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>The shy smile of her merciless predecessor made the expression of Mirack freeze.</p><br/><p>And when I look at another place, there was Juo and Shiva\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShiva-sama\u2026I love you\u2026\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Did you say something?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is nothing\u2026\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Right after, Shiva was once again tackled by the angered fire cow Phalaris.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with this lovey-dovey atmosphere spreading from all sides?!</p><br/><p>In this position where you would get crushed by that love atmosphere, there were girls in their teens who were sensitive to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! What\u2019s with this unsatisfying sensation!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say that heroes are justice and that they don\u2019t get angry and don\u2019t hate, but just at this moment, I don\u2019t think I will be able to protect that\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though we fought with our lives at stake, why am I being attacked by this feeling of wasted effort-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, I will kill Juo. I will kill her before I kill the Demon Lords.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The heroes had darkness spreading in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be helped. 90% of the reasons for the heroes retirements is marriage after all.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>At some point in time, Karen-san was standing at my side, moreover, she was holding my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cK-Karen-san? Why are you holding my hand?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped~.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way it can\u2019t be helped!</p><br/><p>If Karen-san were to retire now, it would be trouble in many meanings!</p><br/><p>Please refrain!</p><hr/><br/><p>TLN: And with this, the arc ends and the \u2018Light God Hero Arc\u2019 will begin.

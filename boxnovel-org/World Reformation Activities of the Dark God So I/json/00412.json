It wasn\u2019t as if it was a power that wasn\u2019t seen by anyone before. So when those mysterious waves resonated, some were able to make a connection.</p><br/><p>And so, those people didn\u2019t hesitate to answer that question.</p><br/><p>Right now, all the people in the whole world clearly learned of the existence of the Dark God, Entropy.</p><br/><p>*****</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, so you were here huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Four years have passed since then, but the cityscape of Apollon City hasn\u2019t changed.</p><br/><p>While I -Kuromiya Haine- was looking at that sight, the Light Founder Yorishiro called out to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have been looking at the city lately.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I will be leaving this city soon after all.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>For me, for the human Kuromiya Haine, this city is a city with a lot of memories.</p><br/><p>This city that I had first arrived at after leaving for the first time from my village that\u2019s deep in the mountains.</p><br/><p>After coming to this city, I for the first time was able to touch the whole of this world, and there, I learned about both the world that the humans took a long time to raise, and also the distortion that was formed by the selfishness of the Gods.</p><br/><p>In order to do justice to the hard work of the humans, I fought in order to fix that distortion the Gods created.</p><br/><p>That battle that took a part of Kuromiya Haine\u2019s life is soon going to come to a close.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince coming to this city, I have truly faced quite a lot of things.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Fun things, shocking things, frustrating things.</p><br/><p>I am Kuromiya Haine, but at the same time, I am the Dark God Entropy.</p><br/><p>For me as the Dark God, the life of this body basically only lasts as long as the blink of an eye, but even with that, it had a depth to it that rivals the 1,600 years after creating this world.</p><br/><p>It has been around 20 years since I was born in this body. Right now, there\u2019s still more than half of my life left as Kuromiya Haine.</p><br/><p>And yet, I am plenty satisfied.</p><br/><p>I am truly glad I incarnated as a human.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, if we don\u2019t go soon, we will miss the ceremony.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I really have to go? I don\u2019t think I am related at all though.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? You have to see her shining moment. More so since you have decided on leaving after the ceremony is finished. It is an unavoidable thing if you want to put a proper conclusion.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>So you say but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, hurry. If you are late here, it will become a regret of yours for life.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cSaying it as if it is a marriage\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Well, for her, it is as big of a turning point in her life as a marriage huh.</p><br/><p>Today, an important ceremony will be taking place for the Light Church.</p><br/><p>The ceremony for a new hero.</p><br/><p>****</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will now be beginning the ceremony for the new light hero, Light Ray.\u201d</p><br/><p>A big amount of people were gathered in the Light Grand Church.</p><br/><p>In order to see the new light hero that will be carrying the standard of the Light Church from today on.</p><br/><p>\u201cRay, over here.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Y-Yessu!\u201d (Ray)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro was fulfilling her duty as Founder and called out to her, and the 15 year old girl that still looked young had stood in attention.</p><br/><p>That girl is Light Ray.</p><br/><p>The new light hero that was chosen with the consensus of the Light Church.</p><br/><p>It has been two years since she entered the ranks of the Light Church, and had her skills acknowledged by the Aurora Knight corps. She managed to climb all the way to being a hero in that short amount of time, so it was clear how much talent she has.</p><br/><p>Even with that, Ray is still young and completely nervous here.</p><br/><p>It is a given. She is still a delicate 15 year old girl after all.</p><br/><p>No doubt she is not used to having the attention of so many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cLight Ray, you will be the light hero that will be representing our church from today on. You will have to spread the influence of the Light Goddess Inflation-sama -the protection of the light- to the world. Do you have that resolve?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI shu!! \u2014I do!!\u201d (Ray)</p><br/><p>Stumbled again.</p><br/><p>She is a girl that has low guts to begin with, so the ceremony today might have been too heavy on her.</p><br/><p>It was the right choice for me to participate huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cRay, you can do it.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I send her some encouragement in a low voice so that it doesn\u2019t bother the ceremony.</p><br/><p>Because I, for some reason, am considered an important person of the Light Church, I was standing by the side of the Founder, and I was pretty close to where Ray is, so it properly reached her.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>And with my encouragement as the trigger, Ray\u2019s expression tightens.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Please rest assured, Founder-sama! I, Light Ray, will fulfill my duty with all I have so I don\u2019t bring shame to the great previous hero-sama!!\u201d (Ray)</p><br/><p>\u201cSplendid show of resolve.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro nodded pleasedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I will entrust you your personal holy sword. And at the same time\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The eyes of Yorishiro shift to a certain place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs per tradition, the previous light hero will be returning her holy sword. Now previous light hero, Kourin Karen-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Founder-sama.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san, who was lined up with me a few steps back of Yorishiro, moved forward with her turn coming.</p><br/><p>She is now 20 years old and has grown beautifully as a woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, with a new light hero assuming the post, your duty as hero has finally come to an end. Thank you for all the work you have done until now.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is too great of an honor, Founder-sama.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the last Demon Lord battle against Lucifer, I was truly glad that you managed to return after what seemed to be a despairing situation. Since then, you have continued to work splendidly as the light hero representing the church.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Today, Karen-san is finally not a hero anymore.</p><br/><p>Since the moment I met her, she has been the light hero. So it felt really weird that she won\u2019t be a hero from now on.</p><br/><p>\u201cFounder-sama \u2014Inflation-sama, the holy sword Saint-George that was entrusted to me, I will be returning it to you as of today.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>For the people around, those were words as if she were speaking to Yorishiro as well as the Light Goddess that the church worships.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only a few limited amount of people who know the truth.</p><br/><p>Both of them are the same person.</p><br/><p>Karen-san said it in such way with that intention.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san\u2026 This is the holy sword Arthur that will be entrusted to the new hero. Please pass it on with your own hands.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Karen-san received the new holy sword from Yorishiro, and then, turns around to the girl that will be succeeding her.</p><br/><p>\u201cRay, since the moment I saw you when you joined the Aurora Knight corps, my instincts told me that this day would come. From now on, you are the light hero.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Karen-san hands over the new holy sword to the new hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will definitely be a hard journey, but I am sure you will be able to do it. Do your best.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me! I will become a light hero that won\u2019t lose to your shine, Karen-neesama!\u201d (Ray)</p><br/><p>And just like this, a hero had departed from the Light Church.</p><br/><p>Now, Karen-san is simply Kourin Karen.</p><ul><li>413: Psyche</li></ul><br/><p>At the last fight of the Great Demon Lord battle.</p><br/><p>Karen-san had taken my place in receiving the attack that had everything of Ates, and she ended up with her heart pierced, bringing instant death.</p><br/><p>She was already in a state where no one could do anything.</p><br/><p>No matter the God, it is not possible to bring back a life that\u2019s reaching its end -it shouldn\u2019t be done.</p><br/><p>In that time when we could only despair our own powerlessness, the one who gave us a saving hand was an unexpected person.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, Ates was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ates was the separated part of the Light Goddess, the evil part of her heart.</p><br/><p>Ates had changed her pure light divine power into shadow and entered the shadow spear Abel \u2014in order to combine with me, the Dark God.</p><br/><p>Karen-san took my place.</p><br/><p>The converted divine power of the Light Goddess that should have been injected into me had been injected into Karen-san instead and had combined with the human soul of Karen-san.</p><br/><p>The soul of a human and a God were becoming one.</p><br/><p>Because of this, Karen-san had turned into something that is human and at the same time isn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Karen-san herself had become the other Light Goddess Inflation.</p><br/><p>*****</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that, it was easy to heal my own body with the divine power I gained.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san says, looking back to that time.</p><br/><p>The ceremony safely finished and Karen-san is not the light hero anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was truly scared at first.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was also remembering that time and shivers ran down my spine.</p><br/><p>No matter how many times I remember it, it still has the same effect on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because I felt that the divine power of Ates was resonating with Karen-san\u2019s divine power through the pierced spear that I was questioning myself what in the world would happen.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was relieved when I saw that her body was regenerating with the fused divine power of Ates, but I soon began to imagine another scary possibility.</p><br/><p>Because Karen-san had fused with that Ates.</p><br/><p>An existence that basically consisted on only the wicked parts of the Light Goddess.</p><br/><p>If she were to fuse with something like that\u2026 It made me tremble in fear just thinking that maybe her whole personality would be overwritten and Ates would return.</p><br/><p>In the end, the one who came back was Karen-san who didn\u2019t show much difference from before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe personality of Ates herself had vanished before it fused with me.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The eyes of Karen-san lower and she shows a sorrowful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter being rejected by Entropy who she had felt strongly for all that time, in the weakened mental state she was in, she was unable to maintain herself. She was the kind of person that even went as far as to think that there\u2019s no need for the world as long as Haine-san existed after all.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>So my rejection was plenty shocking enough to push those last remaining fingers holding on right down into the precipice huh.</p><br/><p>She really had nothing revolving around herself but her own agenda.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter losing her essence, the divine power that had turned into pure energy only had found a shelter that is my soul and fused with it.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am surprised it went so smoothly. Ates and Karen-san may have similar elements to begin with, but at that time, Ates had changed to shadow, you know. Moreover, she was a Goddess.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause shadow is basically an intermediate of light and darkness, the compatibility with both was high. Also, my connection as a God Hero most likely served as an intermediate, making the fusing smoother. With the essence of Ates gone, that power of hers had no choice but to recreate its existence with me as the core.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>As the new light.</p><br/><p>And so, she was reborn. A human, but at the same time, a God. A God that has a human soul \u2014That\u2019s Kourin Karen.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san\u2026\u2026 I am truly sorry.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain with the apologizing, Haine-san? In these four years, every time this conversation is brought out, you apologize.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Yeah, but the soul of Karen-san that was supposed to live and die as a proper human had been tied in the curse that is being a God.</p><br/><p>Even if her body were to perish, her soul would exist forever. That\u2019s the kind of curse it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine. If it were an eternity with only myself, I would be so lonely I wouldn\u2019t be able to take it, but I have people that can live together with me forever.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Karen-san held my hand in a very natural manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, I will stay as Karen, and Haine-san will stay as Haine-san. I look forward to what the future will bring us.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san obviously already knows my identity.</p><br/><p>My identity as the Dark God Entropy.</p><br/><p>In the end, we revealed it all, and even with that, we still decided on staying together.</p><br/><p>It means there\u2019s already no escaping it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is nice that you are getting along, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone intruded in our alone time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be troubling if you were to forget about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Yorishiro-sama! We three, no matter how many times we reincarnate, will be together!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san and Yorishiro who are already Light Goddesses were hugging.</p><br/><p>An eternity with me, the Dark God.</p><br/><p>That was the very wish of Ates that was born from a series of events, but in the end, Karen-san was the one who managed to accomplish that wish of hers.</p><br/><p>But even with that, Karen-san is critically different from Ates.</p><br/><p>My basis for that is that Ates saw her ideal world as a place where only her and I were in and anyone else wasn\u2019t allowed\u2026but Karen-san acknowledged everyone that was around her.</p><br/><p>Her love wasn\u2019t only targeted at me, but the whole world.</p><br/><p>Getting involved with this whole world and creating connections, she spread varieties of love, and received the love of others in return.</p><br/><p>Even if they were aiming for the same result, Karen-san and Ates were separated by a deep line that could be considered a boundary.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, you are not a hero anymore starting today, so our relationship will become even simpler now.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight! Our relationship as hero and Founder-sama is gone! We are purely friends now! Love-Love comrades of Haine-san!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Yeah\u2026</p><br/><p>Gotta cast my doubts in the way you put it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI as well. Having a friend like you to share our eternities together, I feel like it will be quite the fun eternity. But right now, let\u2019s enjoy our lives as Yorishiro and Karen. Haine-san will definitely make it fun!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Yorishiro-sama!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Wait, it is troubling to put so much expectations on me!</p><br/><p>\u2026And so, in this way, Karen-san was completely prepared to enjoy her eternal life as a God.</p><br/><p>As I thought, humans are strong in a lot of meanings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, right now, we should enjoy the fact that your title as hero is gone. The preparations for departure are already done, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah! Right!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san is no longer a hero now.</p><br/><p>Kourin Karen will now walk a new and different path from the one when she was the light hero, but before that, it wouldn\u2019t be bad to have a slight intermission.</p><br/><p>\u201cUsing this chance, you will be visiting your friends, right? That\u2019s quite good.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! We have been pretty busy lately, so I haven\u2019t seen them for quite a while. I was thinking about checking how they have been recently!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The heroes that had overcome that final battle together with her.</p><br/><p>They have finished their duties as heroes just like Karen-san and are walking through a new path now.</p><br/><p>Karen-san wanted to use this chance that she had graduated from being a hero to check how they are doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Haine-san, I will be leaving the escorting of Karen-san to you-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYa got it.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It was decided that I would be accompanying Karen-san in that trip of hers.</p><br/><p>The reason I will be leaving Apollon City was because of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go together with you because of my work as Founder, but we are going to be living together for what will be close to an eternity, so not being together for a bit shouldn\u2019t be much.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I ended up leaking out a dry \u2018hahaha\u2026\u2019 along.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s meet at that place.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, at that place then.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Receiving the farewell from Yorishiro, we finally depart.</p><br/><p>The trip for Karen-san\u2019s hero graduation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, let\u2019s go.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san takes a seat on the ethereal flying machine she had prepared.</p><br/><p>If we are going to go around the other nations, there\u2019s no doubt we would need these guys.</p><br/><p>The flight of these guys has truly helped us out in a lot of situations.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, will you be sitting at the back? Or at the front?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have our personal flying machines, you know.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san and I riding one flying machine was a thing that happened way back when we first met.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, it was also my first time riding a flying machine.</p><br/><p>A lot of things happened since then huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really okay? Don\u2019t you want to ride behind me again and cop a feel of my boobs?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said, please forget about that already!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>A lot of things indeed happened, and yet, girls really don\u2019t forget the dark past of men.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-410-411-dark-demon-lord\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 410-411 - Dark Demon Lord\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-414-415-the-fire-since-then\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 414-415 - The Fire since then\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236413\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

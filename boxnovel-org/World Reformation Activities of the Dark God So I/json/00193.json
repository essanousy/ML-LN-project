Super scary!!</p><br/><p>I encountered a female ghost that has ruffled hair!</p><br/><p>Was this a spirit spot?!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Was the girl from before\u2026okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ghost was worried about Karen-san.</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not it.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, she is the proxy wind hero, Brastor Juo. The first time I saw her figure was at the battle stage, but her impression was so big, there\u2019s no way I would forget about it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Right now\u2026I am preparing the ultrasound inspection device. By using both ethereal and wind divine power\u2026it sends ultrasound waves inside the patient\u2019s body\u2026and with the echoes of it\u2026it is possible to investigate the insides. If we use this\u2026we can tell if the bones and organs are okay\u2026\u2026 I developed it.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201c???????\u201d</p><br/><p>I once again can\u2019t understand what she is saying.</p><br/><p>But is this person actually worried about Karen-san?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The one who\u2026created that bomb was me.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I stagger at the sudden confession of hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was my mistake. That woman\u2026asked me if I could make an explosive using ethereal. My blood as a scientist was stirred up. I reduced the power enough so that it wouldn\u2019t kill a human though. I should have asked about what she would be using it for.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>No no no, you should have asked!</p><br/><p>Is this ghost woman an airhead?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you speak about \u2018that woman\u2019, you are talking about Sunnysol Ates, right?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am just going to warn you but\u2026you won\u2019t find any evidence. I made it so it wouldn\u2019t leave a single piece after it exploded. The truth about me creating it and giving it to that woman\u2026my testimony will not serve as proof enough. If she were to play the fool\u2026that would be the end of it.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It is true that looking at how Ates has moved until now, there\u2019s no way she would make a mistake like leaving evidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso\u2026I won\u2019t apologize either.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ghost proxy wind hero, Brastor Juo, said this resolutely with a little bit of guiltiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also\u2026have something I can\u2019t forgive in today\u2019s match. That\u2019s why\u2026I have come outside after a long time. I will definitely have Shiva-sama\u2026resign as a Founder.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>The proxy wind hero and the Wind Founder Toreido Shiva. No, not only that, Shiva is also the previous wind hero.</p><br/><p>Maybe they have some sort of relationship, or might be a connection?</p><br/><p>She probably said everything she wanted to say, the ghost made a turn and left \u2013while scaring all the people she passed by.</p><br/><p>But, yeah. The fight will still continue.</p><br/><p>The hero team fight was going to be declared the victory of the current heroes, but that was all blown away by the bomb of Mina and ended up as indefinite.</p><br/><p>The previous heroes that were knocked out in the fight must have already regained consciousness like Juo who I met just now.</p><br/><p>Even if it was an underhanded method, it could still be said that they overcame a difficulty and connected the fight to the next.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When I returned to the nursing room, the room was shrouded in an even heavier atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, everyone?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It was so heavy, I had to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That light knight General left just now, but before that, he told us something unbelievable.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It is about Dobbe huh.</p><br/><p>Him saying nothing good is an usual occurrence but, just what happened?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the matches resume, the format will apparently be changed. He said that the team battle had luck involved way too much that the fairness of it would be harmed or something like that.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Hah?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that explanation that had zero convincing power?</p><br/><p>In that case, don\u2019t go establishing a system like randomly choosing your opponents right from the start.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the new format that will be used when the match resumes be apparently 1 vs 1 matches-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cA total of five 1vs1 matches. The first one to get 3 wins is the victor, apparently. It seems like it will be matched with current and previous heroes of the same element.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Meaning that it will be Mirack vs Kyouka; Celestis vs Sarasa; Sasae-chan vs Yoneko-san; Hyue vs Juo; and Karen-san vs Ates.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>They once again came with a method that doesn\u2019t care about appearance.</p><br/><p>At first, they tried to get a perfect victory by matching them with the perfect elemental affinities. But that was overturned by the teamwork of the current heroes team and instead ended up with them being attacked in their weak points.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, those people that have learned from it have chosen the more certain way of winning without caring about winning in the best-looking way.</p><br/><p>By shifting the team match to individual matches, they have sealed the strongest point of the current heroes which is their teamwork. On top of that, it is a 1vs1 against the previous and current heroes of the same element.</p><br/><p>If we go by the individual ability without relying on the elemental affinities, the previous heroes who are the oldest ones have the advantage. That has also been proved in the team match before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose guys probably wanted to make the 1vs1 matches against elements we were weak against as well, but that would be way too obvious no matter how you put it.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo they plan on defeating us with raw ability huh. Even so\u2014!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s way too dirty!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the team match just now, it was about to end with our win, and yet, having to redo it from square one is way too dirty! Let\u2019s go complain! Along with the Founders! And then\u2014!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>However, what she was saying was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have the audience ally with us as well! The people that were watching should have noticed the strangeness as well! An explosion suddenly happened, and then redoing the match that was practically set is just impossible! They should be thinking that way as well! If we were to hit them with that will of us\u2014!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice lacking in strength came from the bed.</p><br/><p>It is Karen-san.</p><br/><p>Has she regained consciousness?!</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san!!\u201d \u201cKaren!\u201d \u201cKaren-chi!\u201d \u201cKaren-neechan!\u201d \u201cKaren-dono!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone surrounded the bed. Karen-san narrowed her eyes in happiness when she saw this.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the water heal of Celestis, Karen-san\u2019s burned areas had disappeared without leaving trace behind, and in terms of appearance, she seems to be in perfect condition already. However, because of the blast of the explosion, the inside of the body received damage, and without proper inspection, we can\u2019t be optimistic.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go just like this. Let\u2019s take on this individual matches.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut! With you in that state, it is impossible! They definitely will judge you as a loss by default! When that happens, in essence, we would only be allowed to lose once!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry that I will be troubling everyone! But you see, in this fight, we have to let the other side do whatever dirty moves they want and still manage to win.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Even with the weakened voice due to her injuries, Karen-san said this with a strong will.</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama said it, didn\u2019t she. The real objective of this fight is to smoke out all the ones from the contra-reconciliation side without leaving a single one behind. The more underhanded methods they take, the more room Yorishiro-sama and the others have to bring them out to light.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might be true but\u2026!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama also understands that, so she has been letting the other side do whatever they want while staying silent. The Knight General Dobbe being a staff member must have been a trap set up by the Founders!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It is true that Yorishiro should be able to do that much.</p><br/><p>The fight between the new and old heroes is not one that will end with just today. This is simply a part of what must be done in a fight that will take a long time.</p><br/><p>The ones on the right are the current heroes and the Founders that support them, and the ones who have taken in the previous heroes to their side are the evil ones; by having the audience today view it in this way, it will serve as quite the tactical advantage.</p><br/><p>The anger that the audience feels will not be used in today\u2019s battle, it will be used in order to burn the ones pulling the strings in the shadows without leaving a single one behind.</p><br/><p>But\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no need for Karen-san and the others to tag along with that!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there is. This is all in order to create a system that will allow us humans to go against the Mother Monsters and the Demon Lords. This is an urgent matter. We are\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The light hero Karen had a pained expression, but continued speaking</p><br/><p>\u201cStrong! I want to have everyone know this. To the audience that has come here today, and to all the people in the world as well, and also to the previous generation heroes as well; I want them to know that no matter what monster appears, we are so strong we won\u2019t lose. That\u2019s why, I want to let the contra-reconciliation side do all the underhanded moves they want, and show everyone that, even with that, we can still win!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Strong light was reflected in the eyes of the injured Karen-san.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, no one was able to say anything back.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. I am always on the side of Karen.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s ride on their play then.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cSobo-chan told me that dirty conspiracies be things that only weak insects do-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have to settle things with Juo too after all.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The will of Karen-san was transmitted to the other heroes as well. That\u2019s why these girls are strong.</p><br/><p>And just like this, the second act of this battle began.</p><br/><p>The current heroes vs the previous heroes; 1vs1 matches.</p><br/><p>The first match is with the fire heroes; the current hero Katack Mirack vs the previous hero Abi Kyouka.</p><ul><li>194: Duo</li></ul><br/><p>Before the individual matches between the heroes began, I was told this.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease be the referee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>At the time when we were sending off Mina, Yorishiro told me this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the 1vs1 of the heroes, it will basically be a deathmatch with no rules, but even if that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s the need of a person that can judge the ending of the fight and decide the victor. I want to ask Haine-san of this.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>She told me something like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I am a person from the current heroes side through and through. Am I appropriate to stand as a referee that requires fairness?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we think of this as creating a balance with the contra-reconciliation side and the previous heroes side, there should be no problem. Also, I might have been underestimating Ates-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Yorishiro bit her lips.</p><br/><p>As if she was holding in her regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think they would use such a direct method in the middle of the match. I was planning on letting her swim as much as she wanted, and then grasp a lot of evidence regarding their dishonesty, but it would be pointless if it ends up hurting the heroes in the process. In order to protect the girls, Haine-san, it is the safest if you were right by their side.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>It is true that if I had been standing at their side in the last moments of the team match, I could have stopped the bomb of Mina.</p><br/><p>If I stand at the battle stage as a referee, I can stop most things with dark matter before it happens.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about just suspending the matches?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought of that as well, but when I went to visit Karen-san, she stopped me. \u2018If we stop here, it would be giving the victory to the other side\u2019, she said.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t Karen-san a bit too hungry on winning this time around?</p><br/><p>Rather than her injury, that issue is beginning to worry me more.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is okay. Karen-san and the others will win.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>And Yorishiro will win as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what kind of dirty cards they bring out, they will crush them all and win. That\u2019s the etiquette of the truly strong ones. This fight is a fight that will transmit this truth to the whole world.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>And after the fight, this will corner the contra-reconciliation side that have been pulling those underhanded tactics.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the reason we are allowing the underhanded tricks this time. In order to have the opponent get ahead of themselves, I understand that there\u2019s the need to act as if we are being defeated, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDepending on the result of the Wind Church\u2019s diagnosis, it is possible that Karen-san\u2019s participation might be banned. The person herself is adamant in participating though.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is better to think about winning three with the remaining four, right? Understood. I accept the job as referee. I will hunt all troubles in the location with my dark matter.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am counting on you. In that time, I will be opening the mouth of this girl.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro hugs the bomber Mina tightly.</p><br/><p>Someone that was a mere maid of the Light Church has received a hug from the Founder, and her blue face from a while now has turned into a pale white one.</p><br/><p>But I won\u2019t pity her.</p><br/><p>Receive the love of the Light Founder that even the heroes fear.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>And just like this, I stood on the battle stage.</p><br/><p>The people in the audience filling up the whole place were also blowing up with the strangeness of this situation and were surprised by it, but the speech of the current heroes that was done just a while ago saying \u2018we will definitely win!\u2019 had made them concentrate on the outcome of the battle.</p><br/><p>There shouldn\u2019t be a small amount of citizens that are also in the contra-reconciliation side. This is also a fight in order to bring those people to our side.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s begin by calling the participants of the first match.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026a-at the red corner, the current fire hero, Katack Mirack! At the blue corner, the previous fire hero, Abi Kyouka!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>From the entrance gates, the two past and present heroes appear.</p><br/><p>The first fight will be a clash between the fire heroes.</p><br/><p>The two are women that have way too fit bodies, and are both tall and muscular. Those two stood in the middle of the stage and were glaring directly at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This is how it should have been done from the very beginning.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>As if doing their introductory remarks, the first one to speak out was Kyouka.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy objective is to beat you into shape from square one. I don\u2019t care about the others. The interlopers have finally disappeared. You are prepared, Mirack?\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cSis Kyouka, I have misjudged you.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The short but sharp words of Mirack made Kyouka falter for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking of me as cowardly is just an arbitrary view of Sis. There\u2019s definitely places where I am lacking, but to think that you would even join hands in the conspiracy that\u2019s trying to bring down our master for that sake.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The current Fire Founder, Enou, was the master of those two.</p><br/><p>In this time\u2019s match, there\u2019s also the condition that if the current heroes were to lose, the current Founders have to resign as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you are doing is returning favor with evil. I can\u2019t overlook this as a pupil of the same master. More so with the unsightliness you showed at the team match before. Just where did the prided fire hero Abi Kyouka of the past go to?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Kyouka pushes out her fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack, if you are a hero, speak with your fists! There\u2019s no worth of existence in a weak hero. I will be teaching you this right now!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>The two of them heat up.</p><br/><p>It should be fine now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, begin match!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The two fires that were released in concert to my voice were burning at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c[[Flame Burst]]!!\u201d\u201d (Mirack+Kyouka)</p><br/><p>The fire whirls that occurred at the exact moment from two different places were like spinning tops clashing with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Mirack?! Do you plan on defeating me with a fire dragon of that level?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cGugh!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>But no matter who saw it, they would be able to tell that there was a difference in the strength of the two fire dragons.</p><br/><p>The weak one was being steadily crushed by the stronger one.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Fist Barbarossa! Change my divine power into raging fire!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cToo soft! Fire Fist Fernando! Fire Fist Pelarius! Dual Fists, Dual Fire Dragons!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Kyouka has fire divine tools in both hands, and the fire that was released from them was obviously twice as much as it attacks Mirack.</p><br/><p>Compared to that, the fire divine tool Mirack uses is only the Fire Fist Barbarossa.</p><br/><p>In a sense, it could be considered a 2 vs 1, and it was clear who was at an advantage here.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack was slowly but surely being pushed back.</p><br/><p>With the strength of her fire dragon, the most she could do was endure to her best the same attack Kyouka was bringing out.</p><br/><p>But that wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>Is there really that much difference in power? Is it not possible too oppose the previous heroes that have trained for a longer time?</p><br/><p>\u201cLearn with that body of yours, Mirack! This is how a hero actually looks like! Stronger than everyone, not losing to anyone! And because of it, there\u2019s no need for the help of anyone either! That\u2019s what a hero is!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><ul><li>195: A flash of gratitude</li></ul><br/><p>The fight was extremely painful to watch.</p><br/><p>In terms of basic divine power difference, Mirack was already at a state where she could only stay in the defensive.</p><br/><p>At times, her own fire dragon would be destroyed and burns would be left in her body, and every time that happened, she would barely avoid fatal wounds as she withstood at the edge.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Kyouka didn\u2019t have a single wound and wasn\u2019t even out of breath.</p><br/><p>Right now the attacks have temporarily loosened. She was looking down at her junior who was letting out steam from her whole body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you admit your defeat already? Your current self can\u2019t beat me. The current you has forgotten the origin of your strength.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe origin\u2026of my strength?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Even so, Mirack didn\u2019t forget her will to resist as she stands up unsteadily.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven to this day, I still remember the day I first met you. Just how many years has it been already. At the day the Ignis Militant corps were doing the entrance exams, I was in the venue as a test overseer. And that\u2019s when I met you who came to take the test.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour fire element numbers didn\u2019t even reach the two hundreds. Normally, it should have already been a fail from that. But even with that, you still clung onto me.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p><i>\u2018I definitely want to become the fire hero\u2019, </i>you said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was outpushed by the zeal of a brat! In the end, I asked master, and you were somehow allowed to enter the Ignis Militant corps. But after that, it should have been a living hell for you. Days of training while being several steps behind the others. Shouted by the instructor, being looked down upon by your colleagues, but even with that, you continued working hard.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>I have heard of that before.</p><br/><p>Just how much effort Mirack has put on to become the fire hero.</p><br/><p>But for that sake, she\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd just as you declared, you had become the fire hero. There were many others with more talent than you, and yet, you pushed them all aside and grabbed ahold of the spot of hero. It was a feat that came most of all from effort. But the current you is trying to rot your strongest point by your own hands \u2013by getting familiar with others.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Kyouka once again gathers divine power to her dual fire fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs your senior, I have to correct that mistake of yours. For that sake, I have gone as far as participating in this fight that goes against master!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cSis Kyouka\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cSmear in the shame of defeat once and learn about what position you are in! If it is you, you should be able to reach it. Aim for even greater heights!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Mirack staggered as she took a battle stance. The line of her stance was firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hated you.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were truly my complete opposite. You had high fire element compatibility from the moment you were born and climbed up to being a fire hero without any difficulties. I thought that the reason why you were always leaving the talentless me by your side was because you wanted to look down on me and bully me to obtain a feeling of superiority.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I could tell even in the middle of battle; after hearing the declaration of Mirack, the heartbeat of Kyouka was speeding up irregularly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you were defeated by the Fire Cow and retired from your position as a hero, I was silently cheering. I was thinking \u2018that woman had finally fallen from her high horse\u2019, \u2018well deserved\u2019. But that way of thinking was a mistake.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a person who taught me that my menial prejudice was all a mistake.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack\u2019s gaze was directed at me for a moment. And then, it moved to the audience seats.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-chan!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san was at the audience seats.</p><br/><p>Did the examination of the Wind Church already finish?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you best, Mirack-chan!! Don\u2019t lose!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat right-dasu, Mirack-neechan! Push through with guts-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forgive you if you lose right at the beginning of our performance!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-dono! It is all in the concentration!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only Karen-san, the other heroes who were on wait for their own matches were not lacking in the support for their comrade.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcessive effort will warp your heart and you will end up forgetting something important from it. Why was I trying to become strong, why I wanted to become a hero; I had recently forgotten about such important things\u2026\u2026Along with my gratitude towards you.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>The first time I met Mirack, it was a completely different Mirack from the current Mirack here.</p><br/><p>Seeing every person as an enemy, even rejecting her old friend Karen-san as she held a composed face when pouring her with insults.</p><br/><p>This hellish training time that Kyouka speaks of, that overwhelmingly harsh time, had slowly warped the heart of Mirack in exchange of growth.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if that was the correct thing to do or not, but the current Mirack is not the same from the one at that time.</p><br/><p>A Mirack that has the power she gained from her blood-vomiting experience and has remembered the important memories of her young days.</p><br/><p>The never ending affection towards Karen-san is what has completed the current Mirack.</p><br/><p>The new Mirack knows that there\u2019s other important people aside from herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can now clearly tell. It is because you were there that I was able to become a hero. It is because you picked me up that I was able to enter the Ignis Militant corps. Even after that, you always left me at your side and taught me important things and provided me irreplaceable experiences. When you retired, I later learned that you were the one who nominated me as your successor.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack\u2026!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because you raised me with care that I was able to reach to where I am now. Forgetting something as important as that, I got so prideful thinking I had come all this way on my own, but my comrades reprimanded me. They made me remember a lot of important things\u2026\u2026and that gratitude, I will release it all in this fist. Sis Kyouka, I will also be answering you with my all!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I could tell that the inside of Mirack was beginning to increase in temperature with fire divine power. It was silent, yet hot.</p><br/><p>High temperature was pulsating inside of Mirack.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Kyouka was furious.</p><br/><p>The fire dragon that was released from the dual fists was the biggest until now.</p><br/><p>Was this the display of her own mental state? It was so big and violent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack! Take this, my \u2018Flame Burst\u2019 with the highest output!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>It was as if a great fire dragon was attacking Mirack like a fire tsunami.</p><br/><p>Won\u2019t a human be turned into cinders if they were to be attacked by something like that?</p><br/><p>However, Mirack didn\u2019t show a single sign of running away, and pushed out her right fist that was drawn back to its limits.</p><br/><p>\u201cBear witness to it! My new technique, [Fire Blade]!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>A thin thin fire sword was released from the fire fist Barbarossa.</p><br/><p>The fire sword stretches towards Kyouka.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that just like the \u2018Holy Light Sword\u2019 of Karen-san?!</p><br/><p>The fire sword of Mirack pierced through the fire tsunami of Kyouka and reaches her who is at the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuaagh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>It reached her chest splendidly and the previous hero was blown away just like that.</p><br/><p>But even if the caster was defeated, it doesn\u2019t mean that the fire tsunami will disappear.</p><br/><p>The big tsunami, that had simply been punctured slightly, attacked Mirack with its original momentum and swallowed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I hurriedly release dark matter against the fire wave, that was about to reach even the audience seats, and extinguish it.</p><br/><p>That was close.</p><br/><p>Does that mean they were so hot-headed that they didn\u2019t have the composure to think about how it would affect the audience?</p><br/><p>At the battle stage, Mirack, who had been poured from her head down by the fire wave, had all her body thoroughly burned, but even with that, she was still standing \u2013she was firmly standing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack\u2026are you okay?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I ask worried, and Mirack answers cheerfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I were to fall to something like this, I wouldn\u2019t be an opponent for the Mother Monsters.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>The attacks of the Fire Cow and the Great Sea Dragon were a lot more overwhelming after all.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Kyouka who had taken a direct hit from Mirack\u2019s new technique was lying on the ground.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t showing any signs of standing up.</p><br/><p>There was a clear difference between her and Mirack who had received big damage.</p><br/><p>I announced.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst match, in the fire hero match; the winner is the current fire hero, Katack Mirack!!\u201d (Haine)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-191-192-vile-continuation\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 191-192 - Vile Continuation\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-196-198-second-match\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 196-198 - Second Match\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236326\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

With all the piled up grudge I had towards him, I ended up kicking his ass.</p><br/><p>Even so, that guy took the form of a human, blended into human society, and had a decent amount of status and position, so killing him doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed to be done.</p><br/><p>While I was checking on what that guy had been doing as the manager of the idol Celestis, I also learned about several of his other crimes.</p><br/><p>Coacervate had a hold of the Water Church from the shadows, and it was completely under his control.</p><br/><p>He grasped the weaknesses of the current Founder of the Water Church and the management, and even has taken some of their families as hostages in order to have them obey.</p><br/><p>On top of that, he also tailored the hero into an idol, has made fixed fights with monsters, and has used the Church\u2019s believers to play around like crazy.</p><br/><p>But now that I have erased the body of Coacervate in the surface world, those people will be released from him.</p><br/><p>The higher-ups from the Water Church were truly relieved that the demon that had been controlling them from the shadows had vanished, and were happy to lend a hand in concealing his death.</p><br/><p>After that, I used the connections that Coacervate left behind to make negotiations with the Water Church\u2019s higher-ups and resolved the friction that the idol activities of the idol Celestis was causing to the other churches.</p><br/><p>To be more specific, remove all the many benefits that the Celestis fan club obtains from entering the Water Church officially, and don\u2019t do any open proselytizing towards the fans.</p><br/><p>With this, the Water Church believers and the Celestis fans were divided in a sense, and became separate existences.</p><br/><p>Of course, I don\u2019t think this will solve the root of the problem, but the rest can be decided by the higher-ups of the churches.</p><br/><p>The Water Church was surprisingly positive about this kind of reformation, and now that the influence of Coacervate is gone, they took the initiative to accept my proposal.</p><br/><p>They must have considered it a risk to use the singing and dancing of the hero to increase their believers since it might make the image of the Church be perceived as superficial.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I prolonged the negotiation for a bit more because I had to bring it to a point where they assured me that Celestis will still be able to continue her idol activities.</p><br/><p>The time required for this was several days of discussion.</p><br/><p>In that time, Karen-san, Mirack, and Celestis participated in the extra live performances as scheduled, and it seems they passed a meaningful time.</p><br/><p>And so\u2026</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah, that was tough. The fight with the Great Sea Dragon was really tough you know~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Ouch ouch ouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>My spine was creaking from the pain of the camel clutch.</p><br/><p>To explain what\u2019s happening, Mirack was straddling on my back while I was lying down, and just like that, she is pulling my jaw and forcefully turning it.</p><br/><p>The so called Camel Clutch.</p><br/><p>It seems this is also a killer technique passed down by the Ignis Militant corps.</p><br/><p>It is an incredibly dangerous technique that inflicts damage to the spine, that\u2019s why I was going \u2018ouch ouch\u2019 when suffering from it.</p><br/><p>And more than that, the sensation of Mirack\u2019s crotch at my back.</p><br/><p>This sensation of pain and happiness; is she doing it while being aware of this?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know this, Haine? A big sea monster on the level of Phalaris was defeated by Karen, Celestis, and I, you know? It was a fierce fight.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I heard about it. Ouch ouch ouch!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that time, where were you playing around at?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. I am really sorry!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Because I was absent in the Hydra Serpent incident, it ended up being seen as very disgraceful.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way I could say that Coacervate and I were keeping each other in check.</p><br/><p>Mirack also saw my ability agaisnt the fire cow Phalaris, so fooling her won\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>And so, I am in the middle of receiving a normal punishment for a truant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you spare him with that, Mirack-chi?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>And the water hero, Celestis, was in the middle of spectating this punishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that Haine-chi is incredibly reliable, but\u2026involving himself in a battle between monsters and heroes would be a bit too much. Moreover, it was a sea battle, and when you miss the chance of receiving the \u2018Water Blessing\u2019 once, there\u2019s nothing you can do, right? Are you telling him to swim all the way there?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, Celestis. This guy is a lot more reliable than you think.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have expectations of him or not\u2026 Whichever it is, why don\u2019t you stop that super glued submission technique?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how much of your female side you have thrown away, gluing yourself this much to a man is just\u2026erotic.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cUhya!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Looks like she finally noticed her own lack of self-awareness. Mirack jumps away from me.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m saved~~. A bit more and I might have split in two.</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh! Mirack-chi\u2019s girly scream, how rare! Thanks, Haine-chi. Thanks to you, I was able to hear something rare.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you are happy.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Though, if the price of that is one spine, the rate is a bit too high there.</p><br/><p>By the way, the water hero Celestis announced in the ending of the live performance that she will be taking a temporary rest in her idol activities.</p><br/><p>With the disappearance of Coacervate, the Water Church did a coup. There\u2019s no way this wouldn\u2019t affect her as well.</p><br/><p>She was directly involved with Coacervate who was posing as her manager, so there was the need to give proper explanations.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because of the confusion in the Water Church, the manager had hurriedly changed posts\u2019, is the excuse that was made, and for now, it seems she consented to it.</p><br/><p>In the first place, he was suspicious and wasn\u2019t a manager that was liked, so Celestis probably didn\u2019t have much interest in it.</p><br/><p>Until the next manager is assigned, it seems like Celestis will be taking a small vacation.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Haine-chi, I will be repeating myself here but, how about becoming my new manager? Or more like, become my manager!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I have been saying, I can\u2019t. I am the assistant of the light hero after all.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Also, why did you correct yourself and made it into an order?</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, what a loyal one. With Haine-chi\u2019s negotiation abilities, I thought he would be able to face those hard-headed people you know~. The Church suddenly told me to restrain in the idol activities, and I just don\u2019t understand at all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt probably just means that\u2019s how shocking the Great Sea Dragon turmoil was. They will most likely have you concentrate on your hero activities and prepare yourself in case of need. Isn\u2019t that normal? Obey.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because of those dangerous times that idol\u2019s exist. With the singing and dancing of Celes-tan, I will provide hope.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Looks like she won\u2019t change no matter what happens.</p><br/><p>Celestis is a hero that not only fights with divine power, she also fights by giving hope to the people. That\u2019s also a splendid form of hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, just leave the scolding to that much. Haine-chi, how about you go to the next one?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cNext one?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems your direct superior has some words of praise for you. She is waiting for you at her room.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>Praise?</p><br/><p>Did I do something worthy of praise?</p><br/><p>Well, at any rate, I can\u2019t just stand here when I have been urged to go. Let\u2019s leave the room for now.</p><br/><p>If I stay here doing nothing, I feel like the punishment of Mirack might resume.</p><br/><p>I head to the door, and when I passed the side of Mirack, I heard a low voice that barely reached my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Thanks.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard Mirack whispering to me and it made me even more confused. Even so, I had no choice so I left the room just like that.</p><br/><p>When talking about my direct superior, there\u2019s only that person, right?</p><ul><li>61: The hero that became the reward</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cKaren-saaan, did you call?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The place I arrived at is one of the guest rooms of the Water Church.</p><br/><p>It is the room that was provided to the light hero, Karen-san. Karen-san has been sleeping here in these several days, so if she is somewhere, it should be here, so I tried entering the room, but\u2026</p><br/><p>This is weird. I don\u2019t see her anywhere.</p><br/><p>But I do feel the presence of someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san! So you have come!\u201d</p><br/><p>So you really were here, Karen-san.</p><br/><p>But where is she? I don\u2019t see her at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack and Celestis told me to come here but, am I intruding you in the middle of something? If that\u2019s the case, I will come back here another time.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I guess that\u2019s the reason why she isn\u2019t showing herself, but it looks like that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was waiting for Haine-san. Please sit wherever you want.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026if you say so\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, in front of the closet\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Closet?</p><br/><p>\u201cF-First of all, Haine-san, thank you for that time. You have saved us a lot again.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t participate this time around though. I was receiving a punishment for that very same reason not that long ago.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Mirack-chan also understands. That was most definitely her way of hiding her embarrassment.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Her hiding almost cost me a spine though.</p><br/><p>From there, the conversation was temporarily cut off, and silence took place. And then, the one who once again resumed the conversation was Karen-san.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.It was Haine-san there, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What do you mean by that?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean that Black Giant.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Aah.</p><br/><p>She is talking about the Dark element monster I created in order to help Karen-san and the others fight the Hydra Serpent.</p><br/><p>Because I had to keep Coacervate in check, this was a desperate measure I thought with incredible pain.</p><br/><p>Karen-san knows that I am a dark element user, but creating monsters is the deed of Gods.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t just obediently say yes to this.</p><br/><p>In the end, that Black Giant was not only seen by the heroes, but also by many other people, but it only became the seed of much confusion, and with the hard struggle of the heroes, this other point didn\u2019t become the topic of talk.</p><br/><p>A monster that protects humans; such an existence that overturns the common sense of humans, even when seeing it with their own eyes, it was still something hard to believe.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, the mass media also didn\u2019t know how to handle this information and just ignored it, and didn\u2019t even become an article.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is okay, you don\u2019t have to answer me. But, when I was fighting together at the sea with the Black Giant, I felt as if I was fighting together with Haine-san. Even though it was such a dangerous situation, I was really at peace.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Mirack-chan was the same. That\u2019s why I wanted to express my gratitude. Thanks.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san still didn\u2019t show herself, but her feelings reached me plenty well.</p><br/><p>Gratitude, deep affection, goodwill; those kind of feelings.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-And so\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, the tone of Karen-san suddenly became unrestful.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t feel right to always just say thank you, so this time, I want to express my gratitude in a more substantial way!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSubstantial?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>No, there\u2019s no need to mind it that much though.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Haine-san, you are properly in front of the closet, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>For a while now, I have been bothered by this but, the voice of Karen-san\u2026I feel like it is coming from this closet\u2026</p><br/><p>The closet, in other words, the place where the clothes are kept. Even if it is the guest room, this is the guest room that the Water Church lodges their guests of honor, so it has quite the splendid closet, and big enough to have at least one person inside.</p><br/><p>Then, is she actually inside this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, please watch closely, okay? 3\u20262\u20261!!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Why are you doing a countdown?!</p><br/><p>It was clear for anyone that I had to nail my eyes to the closet when the number reached 0.</p><br/><p>And then, the closet opened with a \u2018bam\u2019 from the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san?!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san was naked.</p><br/><p>No, she was in her underwear, so, accurately speaking, she wasn\u2019t completely naked, but even so, she was showing most of her skin which was practically being naked.</p><br/><p>She is normally wearing armor and completely equipped on all her body, so this made this lightly dressed figure of hers even more dazzling. At any rate, her skin is white. I heard before that she had a \u2018weak constitution in the past\u2019, and with this, I can believe it.</p><br/><p>The color of her underwear is also white. Pure white is the symbol color of the Light Goddess, Inflation.</p><figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_6558\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Not the correct image, but hey, that\u2019s practically negligee in my book</figcaption></figure><br/><p>\u201cOkay, over!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san quickly closed the closet and locked herself again.</p><br/><p>In the end, the dazzling pure white underwear figure of Karen-san only lasted for an instant in my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it, Haine-san?! Are you happy?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san asks me from the wooden closet.</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, leaving aside my happiness, is this your way of thanking me?! Is that okay?! This has so many problematic points as a hero!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine! Because Haine-san\u2026\u2026 you also saw the underwear of Celestis-san!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Ah.</p><br/><p>Right before the attack of the Hydra Serpent at the live performance, I do feel like such an accident did occur when Celestis was changing her stage outfit\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean\u2026you were getting competitive with Celestis?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Even so, her shyness made her only endure it for an instant of showing me huh.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t get you, Karen-san. I really don\u2019t get you.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And? How was it? Did I win?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san is unexpectedly concerned with winning and losing.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>And like this, I once again took a peek of a mysterious side of Karen-san.</p><br/><p>My last night at Hydra Ville passed by in this way, but as expected, I have to say this before it is over.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was happy.\u201d (Haine)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-57-59-trinity\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 57-59 - Trinity\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-62-64-he-dark-god-that-became-the-reward\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 62-64 - he Dark God that became the reward\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236269\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

The city is seriously scaryyy!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I roll down from the flying machine that had already landed and enjoy the nostalgic feeling of the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, please get a grip of yourself. We are already at the location, or more like, at enemy territory. It wouldn\u2019t be strange for anything to happen.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Even though Karen-san was on the same ride, she didn\u2019t show a single sign of being exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fastest the light knight corps\u2019 main force can arrive is at best after 5 hours. In that time, we will scout out the place and investigate the monsters\u2019 movements.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uhm, Karen-san, wait for a bit!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to avoid battle, but please be prepared for when it turns out as unavoidable. But at that moment, I will be taking the front, so I won\u2019t let Haine-san face any life endangering situation.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san!! Karen-san!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! Yes?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Because I suddenly raised my voice, Karen-san seems to have gotten surprised.</p><br/><p>But if I didn\u2019t do that, she wouldn\u2019t listen to what I have to say, so it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I still don\u2019t know anything though.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThings like: why I was brought here, where is this place, what is happening here, what should I be doing; Karen-san, you still haven\u2019t explained a single thing.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! \u2026Ah, right!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>So she finally noticed, Karen-san went: \u2018Sorry, sorry!\u2019 while prostrating, and then, she explained the details of what has transcurred till now.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, this place is one of the sections of the Trixia forest located at the southeast of Apollon City.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>From what Karen-san says, it seems a report about the sighting of monsters was received from the Trixia forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonster\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, monsters. Subjugating monsters is the main mission of the Light Knight Corps. And so, we came here in a big hurry.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well, I understand that much but, why was I brought here as well?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of knights at the knight corps, right? You could have brought someone there, and yet, why did you decide on a fresh recruit, moreover, one that failed the exam instantly?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It is not like I don\u2019t like helping out here, but there\u2019s way too many points that don\u2019t make sense in the actions of Karen-san.</p><br/><p>Karen-san made a bitter expression, and answers as if groaning.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The knight corps won\u2019t come.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like I said before, they will arrive here in 5 hours at best. Gathering will take 1 hour, preparing will take 1 hour, and to move all the way here, around 3 hours.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Uwaaa\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBut! If we were to wait that much, it will be way too late! It is true that monsters have appeared in this forest, and if we don\u2019t take them out promptly, there\u2019s no point in me being the light hero.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Once again, Karen-san lowers her head at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am plenty aware that it is strange for me to have Haine-san, who just joined the church, do something like this. But right now, please don\u2019t ask anymore and just lend me your assistance!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this forest, there might still be people that came without knowing that monsters have appeared. Finding those people and having them take refuge, it would be impossible by myself!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The forest around us is still peaceful and there\u2019s only the sound of wind making the leaves dance. However, there\u2019s already danger inside this place.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I turn my heels.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s separate and begin moving. If we are going to search for people that didn\u2019t manage to escape in time, that way is more efficient.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But! If Haine-san were to encounter a monster while you are acting on your own!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I look like this, I am the son of a hunter. This may be my first time in this place, but if it\u2019s a forest, it is practically like a garden. Even against a monster, I will show you I can run away from it.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I end the conversation and run off.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, monsters huh.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s been a time in the past that I have fought against monsters.</p><br/><p>Not as a Dark God, but in the time I was living as Kuromiya Haine.</p><br/><p>In the village I was born and raised in, there\u2019s been times when some would appear mixed with the beasts around, and in those cases, the ones to deal with it are the hunters of the village, father and I, but different from beasts, monsters vanish like mist the moment they are defeated, so there\u2019s not a single profit from it.</p><br/><p>\u2018It is an enemy that only brings losses\u2019, is how father categorized them in terms of problematic ones. That\u2019s what monsters are.</p><br/><p>They were clearly different from people, beasts, and plants, that had been born by receiving the grace of the Gods.</p><br/><p>Or more like, I don\u2019t remember making monsters in the time I was the Dark God.</p><br/><p>Things I didn\u2019t create exist now. One more mystery has been added in this space of 1,600 years.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, leaving that aside\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I stop my feet, and after confirming that there\u2019s plenty enough distance from Karen-san, I stabilize my breathing and concentrate.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s really people that were late in running away inside this forest, there\u2019s no way we would find them by searching blindly.</p><br/><p>I am a reincarnation of the Dark God.</p><br/><p>Even if I am in the body of a human, I can still utilize the divine power of darkness, and am able to feel the \u2018dark waves\u2019 a person releases.</p><br/><p>I touched the topic a bit with the talk about elements not that long ago but, humans were created by all six Gods at the genesis of the world.</p><br/><p>Earth, wind, water, fire, light, and darkness; it is because all those elements are mixed in that they have all elements, and depending on the person, there\u2019s also elements they are good at and elements they are not good at.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, the shadow element will always be present inside the humans. It is just that the people themselves don\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>As the reincarnation of the Dark God, I can feel that part of them.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.I found a reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So there really was someone who didn\u2019t manage to escape in time?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I run full speed to the location where the reaction came from.</p><br/><p>And after not a long period of time, I find an old woman and a small girl leaning on the trunk of a tree. It is probably a grandmother and her daughter.</p><br/><p>At any rate, I ran to the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The old woman was rubbing her swollen leg in pain.I can tell at a glance that she sprained it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you, who are you? This place is dangerous. Monsters have appeared and\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I am a person from the Light Church that has come here for that exact reason.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It is fine for me to say that, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s great! I came to this forest with my grandchild to gather edible wild plants, but\u2026to think we would be encountering something as terrifying as that! When we tried to hurriedly run away, I fell, and\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>She is probably agitated.</p><br/><p>After finishing emergency treatment, I shoulder her on my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, grandma!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou come as well. We will be leaving the forest. If possible, it would be great if you were to guide the way.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It was at this moment\u2026 this forest, that only had the gentle rustling of leaves, had a thunderous sound reverberate in it, and while a lot of leaves were being scattered around, the figure of those guys appeared.</p><br/><p>So it has finally come.</p><br/><p>A monster.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><b>12: Fierce battle against monsters</b></li></ul><br/><p>It has appeared; a monster.</p><br/><p>A bug-shaped monster that is around the size of a human, putting it more concretely, it is a dragonfly.</p><br/><p>A big dragonfly the size of a human was flying in the air while staring right at the old woman, her grandchild, and I.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is totally aiming at us.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Monsters only attack humans.</p><br/><p>For example, even if a rabbit or a deer were to pass here, they wouldn\u2019t even stutter one bit and attack only the humans. They are accursed beings that work in that way.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, I am scared!\u201d</p><br/><p>A young girl, that probably doesn\u2019t even reach 5 years old, was clinging to the old woman while trembling all over, accurately speaking, she was clinging at the old woman that I was carrying on my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerson from the church, please just leave me behind and run away with my grandchild. This is my last will!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that. After being told that, I end up wanting to save you two even more.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>For now, I lower the old woman from my back, and face the giant dragonfly that\u2019s alone.</p><br/><p>The giant dragonfly continues flying in place as it keeps an eye on us. As if measuring the timing to jump at us.</p><br/><p>Noticing that, I purposely turn my eyes away from the giant dragonfly for an instant.</p><br/><p>It was baited splendidly, and the dragonfly charges towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>While avoiding it with a hair\u2019s breadth, I place a hand on the head of the dragonfly that had come right where I am.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c[Dark Matter Set]\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Dark particles surge out from my palm.</p><br/><p>The giant dragonfly that came in contact with it had its head crushed, and it collapses.</p><br/><p>This is the power I possess as the reincarnation of the Dark God.</p><br/><p>What I did just now was Dark Matter, or so to speak, I have released darkness and created particles that normally don\u2019t exist in the natural environment with the dark divine power.</p><br/><p>Its special characteristic is that it is able to absorb all elements excluding darkness and make them disappear.</p><br/><p>On top of that, it can do things like freely controlling the direction of the gravity and the strength of it.</p><br/><p>What I released just now was in a small dose, so to the old woman and the little girl, it must have looked like I crushed the head of the dragonfly with crazy strength.</p><br/><p>Since its head was crushed, the dragonfly died, and the remaining parts turned into small grains of dust and disappeared.</p><br/><p>This is what monsters are; living beings that are outside the principles of nature.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is safe now. Let\u2019s resume our return to the village.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The moment I was about to turn to the old woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cChurch person, at your back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shout of the old woman made me return my gaze, and at that place, there was another giant dragonfly.</p><br/><p>\u201cA second one?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Even though I defeated one just now, a new monster appeared.</p><br/><p>Moreover\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not only 2\u2026 there\u2019s 3\u20264\u202610\u202620!!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s already too many dragonflies to even count, and they were covering the sky.</p><br/><p>To think there were this many\u2026</p><br/><p>It is not an amount I can\u2019t wipe out by increasing the density of Dark Matter, but the old woman and the little girl will definitely be witnessing it.</p><br/><p>The other choice would be to carry both the old woman and the little girl and run away swiftly, but against these giant dragonflies that have wings, moreover, with these numbers, I don\u2019t think I would be able to outrun them.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the natural state of this world, my dark divine power is something I would like keeping secret, but\u2026it seems it can\u2019t be helped. I will just have to hope that the old woman can keep it secret and that the little girl will be taken as fantasizing.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Dark Matter S\u2014\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait there!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden call made me hurriedly stop the dark matter that was about to come out from my palm.</p><br/><p>An armoured girl is running here with ragged breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. You are okay, right?! Pythonflies were gathering at an alarming rate, so I thought there was definitely something going on!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cPythonflies?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am talking about those giant dragonflies there. A wind element monster, Pythonfly. As normal from a wind element, their body is fragile, but to compensate for that, they have wings and fast speed, and the most problematic part is that they act in swarms. The moment they find a human, they quickly gather like this.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san turns her gaze towards the old woman and the little girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand the situation. Just leave the rest to me, Haine-san. Please protect the civilians.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut fighting those numbers with just you alone would be\u2014\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is okay.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san unsheathes the sword that was hanging at her waist.</p><br/><p>A beautiful white and shiny blade that doesn\u2019t lose to her hair and armor. A very straightforward sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the light divine power that the Light Goddess has honoured me with. I became a hero in order to stand at the front and protect the powerless.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The white blade shines. As if power was being gathered in it.</p><br/><p>I remember seeing that before. At the time when I fought the knights at my homeland, captain Vesage had gathered light divine power inside a dagger when he shot the light arrow at me.</p><br/><p>But the one that captain Vesage was using was only as big as a fruit knife, compared to the sword of Karen-san that is clearly a sharp sword that would be able to split a monster in two just as it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly sword Saint-George that was given to me together with my title as the Light Hero, please release here the holy power that is gathered inside your body!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The light divine power that was released from the sword flew straight to the sky and bisects the Pythonflies that were at the edge of the swarm.</p><br/><p>Something that I would call a light sword wave had been released from the sword of Karen-san. The light sword wave stretched widely from its sides, and perfectly sliced in two the swarm of Pythonflies that were a mass in the sky.</p><br/><p>Several tens of giant dragonflies were falling, and before they reached the ground, they turned into dust.</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>With only one swing, she was able to defeat several monsters.</p><br/><p>It is on a whole different level from the \u2018Holy Light Bullet\u2019 that captain Vesage used. So this is the power of the hero.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026But\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The swarm of Pythonflies were still occupying the sky.</p><br/><p>It is true that the \u2018Holy Light Blade\u2019 is big and unparalleled, and can cut down everything it touches, but it can be called a line attack. It wasn\u2019t enough to wipe the swarm that spreads around a whole side of the sky.</p><br/><p>In other words, she did defeat a lot, but there\u2019s still a lot more left.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is okay. Until the last one falls, I will use the \u2018Holy Light Blade\u2019 as many times as it takes\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Or so Karen-san says passionately, but I wonder if she can really release a big move like that continuously.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it, Karen-san. The best move would be to use that technique to provide cover while we run with the civilians.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if we don\u2019t wipe them out here and now, they might attack other people. As a hero, there\u2019s no way I can forgive tha\u2014\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>At that moment, the voice of someone, that was not her or me, reverberated in the forest.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Flame Burst]\u201d</p><br/><p>At the next instant, the sky, that was covered by grotesque Pythonflies, was now covered by something entirely different.</p><br/><p>Deep crimson red flames.</p><br/><p>Those Pythonflies were burnt by those flames and became ashes, and not a single one remained as they disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karen-san and I were taken by surprise, and could only look at the crimson abnormality in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, as I thought, the Light Hero is useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then, the shadow of a person appears. It was the same voice that resounded in the sky a few moments ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, you are not worthy of being called a hero. I am the only true hero. It is none other than the one that has received the divine power of the God, Nova-sama, the fire hero, Katack Mirack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><b>13: Second Hero</b></li></ul><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fire hero, Katack Mirack?\u201d</p><br/><p>I look at the girl that suddenly appeared with surprise.</p><br/><p>Even if I say girl, she is tall and has a suntanned skin, and at a glance, you would even mistake her for a man. But being able to identify her as a woman even with that is because of her breast area that was widely open.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-chan?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cServes you right, Kourin Karen.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The girl called Mirack approaches Karen-san with rude steps.</p><br/><p>She was practically picking a fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing cornered by something as weak as a Pythonfly, you weakling. If I hadn\u2019t come in, who knows what would have happened?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah, thanks, Mirack-chan.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The attitude of Karen-san towards her was cowering, and the behaviour she has shown until now was completely in hiding.</p><br/><p>By the way, in that time, I judged that the monsters were now gone and the danger had disappeared, so I returned to helping the old woman and her grandchild.</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Right, Haine-san! I will introduce you!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>And Karen-san called me back.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is Katack Mirack-san. The fire hero.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, isn\u2019t the hero Karen-san? Are there several heroes?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I am the light hero. Haine-san also knows about the five Gods of creation, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Remembering the times before I reincarnated, I end up feeling the urge to stab a fork inside the nose of each one of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, there\u2019s churches that follow their respective God among the five. One of them is the Light Church that follows the Light Goddess, Inflation-sama. It refers to us.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also the churches that follow the Fire God, Nova; Water God, Coacervate; Wind God, Quasar; Mother Earth, Mantle. And each church has their own hero that represents them. Mirack-chan is the fire hero that was chosen for the Fire Church.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, there\u2019s five heroes in total?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s r\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t joke around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karen-san was going to answer, but Mirack interjects.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one hero, the others are all fakes. And the real hero is me. Because I am the strongest hero within all the others after all. At the very least, I am better than a hero that may have thinned the monster swarm but had gotten the better of her.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of Karen-san shrivels.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously, what a saddening way of fighting that was, light hero. Compared to that, I used \u2018Flame Burst\u2019 and wiped them all out. That proves the power that the Fire God, Nova-sama, has granted me is superior to that of the Light Goddess by leaps and bounds.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack turns to my direction, completely glaring at me. It was an anger that felt as if she would spit fire from her eyes, but I continued without caring.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san\u2019s \u2018Holy Light Blade\u2019 is a technique that sends a light sword wave of light divine power. Its power is high, but it can\u2019t be considered a large area of effectivity. On the other hand, your \u2018Flame Burst\u2019, was it? That one is an attack that has large area of effectivity and is the type that spreads. Nova\u2019s powers are mostly those types after all. The situation just now was <i>coincidentally </i>favorable for the fire element. Isn\u2019t that all there\u2019s to it?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with this weakling?! So conceited!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, no matter how high-and-mighty you act, there\u2019s a truth that\u2019s unmoveable.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fact that Karen-san was the first one to arrive at the scene.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Being pointed out that, the loose tongue of Mirack-san had stopped.</p><br/><p>She most likely didn\u2019t have any words to refute it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are here, that means you came here promptly when you received the report of the monster sightings, but even so, Karen-san was faster. That\u2019s why it was possible to save this old lady and her grandchild. That\u2019s without doubt the achievement of Karen-san, not yours.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The old woman and her grandchild that had gotten back their composure gave their gratitude to Karen-san.</p><br/><p>She was worried about the situation on this side, but right now she was responding to the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, you were able to burn down the monsters in one swipe because Karen-san\u2019s attack had gathered them into one location. If they were scattered here and there, even your fire wouldn\u2019t have been able to wipe them out in one attack. It might even become a difficult fight with caution of not making a mountain fire.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid, something like that is just\u2014!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reality. In this time\u2019s fight, the light hero that came here first was rescuing the people while luring the monsters, and then, the fire hero wiped them out. A victory through team play.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam\u2026play?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I grab the wrist of Mirack-san with my right hand, and with my left hand, I grab the wrist of Karen-san. And then, I bring both close to each other, and had the hand of Mirack-san and Karen-san hold each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d \u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the form of a handshake.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs humans, as heroes; is there really any need to fight each other? Today\u2019s victory was the victory of you both. Let\u2019s all be happy together!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around!!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>With more strength than I expected, the hands that were linked had been shaken off.</p><br/><p>And with glaring eyes that were strong enough to ignite someone, she says.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! I don\u2019t know from what countryside you popped out from, but let me tell you this! For me, heroes are as much of an enemy as monsters! Only I am the true hero! I will also settle things up with the other ones in time! To prove who the true hero is!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Saying what she wanted to say, she turned around and left.</p><br/><p>We stood there.</p><br/><p>In this forest where the monsters had been defeated and peace had returned, only the sad face of Karen-san remained.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-08-10-grunt-of-light\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 08-10 - Grunt of Light\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-14-15-a-conceited-reflection-time\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 14-15 - A conceited reflection time\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236250\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

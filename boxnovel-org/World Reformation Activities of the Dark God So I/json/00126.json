If it were to use all of them as weapons and takes them out from underground, the tree wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain balance and fall.</p><br/><p>Those five are probably the bare limit to how many Grandma Wood can take out while still maintaining balance.</p><br/><p>At least that\u2019s what I would like to think. If it were to increase even more, no matter how reliable of a reinforcement were to come, we wouldn\u2019t be able to control the situation.</p><br/><p>I heard a shout from my ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, what are we going to do?! Just trying to stop those giant roots of the tree is already a crazy tough mission, you know! It might even be an impossible task!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might already know, but I will say it just in case! Don\u2019t touch that root directly! We will end up assimilated as well after all!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeh?! But I can\u2019t do proper damage unless I cut it directly-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, Sasae-chan! If you do a hit-and-run, you won\u2019t get caught!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Their voices were coming at me from the wireless device.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the work of the heroes, there\u2019s already no people around the perimeter of battle. Looks like they have been safely evacuated.</p><br/><p>But now that there\u2019s no people around, the Golems that now have nothing to do were gathering around where Karen-san and her group are in, and the more time passes, the higher the chances they will be crushed by the numbers.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I see from above, the Golems have changed their objective and are heading your direction! Their moves are dull, but they are trying to crowd onto you! The more time it passes, the difficult it will be to move!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAbove?! Where are you at?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to be entering preparations, so I can\u2019t help. I repeat! I can\u2019t help! Please stop the movements of the roots by yourselves! I am counting on you!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was already in the process of compressing my dark matter.</p><br/><p>I would say it will take me until around the time I count to 1,000. Will the heroes be able to stop the movements of the roots by then?</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, hear me out!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The voice of Karen-san reverberates from the wireless device.</p><br/><p>\u201cEach of us fighting one separately won\u2019t let us stop the roots from moving! Let\u2019s gather up, cooperate, and find a method that we can do!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cCooperate\u2026in other words\u2014?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen in trouble, combined elements, right?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. In the long history of the five churches, not only the five have been fighting each other, this in turn made the heroes antagonistic with each other too.</p><br/><p>When those heroes have overcome their conflicts with each other and put their hearts together, put their elements together, a new element is created.</p><br/><p>That miracle has saved those girls from danger several times already.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What you girls talking about-dasu?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The new member Sasae-chan was the only one who couldn\u2019t keep up with the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is that! The thing that destroyed your Golems in Apollon City!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what will we be combining with what?! Mine and Karen-chi\u2019s \u2018Mirage\u2019 may serve to confuse, but it won\u2019t be fulfilling the request of stopping its movements, you know!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Lightning\u2019 and \u2018Explosion\u2019 have way too high of a possibility to drag the people that are captured in the roots along with it, so we can\u2019t use those either. In other words, the things we have used until now are all out of the question. That\u2019s why, the one that we can put our hopes into is\u2026at a new possibility!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>A new possibility?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026I see. Sasae! Where are you right now?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat-dasu?! I be sending a sign-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Soon after, a big cloud of dust rose up in the battlefield at a certain place.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not long after\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Alright! I am the first one! Sasae, let\u2019s do it!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiiaa?! What-dasu?! Suddenly hugging me?! Why ye suddenly pouring divine power inside mah body-dasu?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine, just match my breathing! Mix the divine power! Chant the words that appear inside your heart just as it is! Get it?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cFueeeee?!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c[Magma Ocean]-dasu!!\u201d\u201d (Mirack+Sasae)</p><br/><p>The ground was dyed completely red.</p><br/><p>I was in standby high up in the sky, so I could tell. It was letting out a fluid-type of shine that was different from fire, and the ground was shining in red.</p><br/><p>Could that be\u2026lava?!</p><br/><p>The combination of fire and earth has created this lava?!</p><br/><p>Because the ground has been covered in a liquid that is several thousand degrees in temperature, it made the roots of Grandma Wood falter and loosen their attacks but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would burn the captured people into a crisp-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. If they were to make a wave from the lava that appeared, they would be able to deal heavy damage to Grandma Wood, but the people that are captured in the roots will certainly die.</p><br/><p>Just like how \u2018Lightning\u2019 and \u2018Explosion\u2019 are no good, the new \u2018Magma\u2019 is obviously also an overkill.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, as expected of the fire element! No matter what you mix into it, it all turns into something atrocious!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The voice I heard from the wireless device was Celestis. The next one to run to Sasae-chan was her huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust watch! This idol hero, Celestis-sama, will produce magnificent and beautiful water divine power, and do a complete make-up of this country bumpkin girl!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiih?! I be in great demand for a while now-dasu?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>It is hard to tell from just their voices alone, but Sasae-chan is probably in a state where she is being treated like a pet by a group of girls.</p><br/><p>It is the pattern where she gets pampered so much that the next day she will end up all exhausted.</p><br/><p>And then, what appeared from mixing \u2018water\u2019 and \u2018earth\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d[Tree Plant]!!\u201d (Celestis+Sasae)</p><br/><p>With the two as the center, a green color mist was released, which is something I could see from my point of view.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that mist?</p><br/><p>And then, it fell due to gravity and falls to the ground, and when that happened, a surprising change occurred.</p><br/><p>Grass began visibly growing on the surface of the ground, moreover, it was stretching without limits.</p><br/><p>It was terrifyingly thick ivies. That\u2019s the kind of plant it gave me the impression of.</p><br/><p>Those wrapped around the roots of Grandma Wood and drag them to the ground.</p><br/><p>Because they were plants, I thought for a second that they might be enemies, so I was cautious, but as I thought, it seems to be the combined element of Sasae-chan and Celestis.</p><br/><p>Mixing earth and water, \u2018Green\u2019 appears. Moisturizing the earth, it invigorates the plants.</p><br/><p>\u201cBingo!! Look at that! Being wrapped in ivy, the roots of that bastard tree can\u2019t do anything! It is fulfilling the request of Haine-chi a 100%! Truly fighting fire with fire, plants with plants! As expected, of an idol. This is Celes-tan!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough with the boasting! If the combination of you and Sasae is a jackpot, grab the other roots as well.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes, I get it. I will move now\u2014wait, eeeeh?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>But she couldn\u2019t. The Golems that had gathered at the surroundings were still continuing to surround them after all.</p><br/><p>The giant roots that Grandma Wood is swinging around are 5 in total. Right now, only one of them has been wrapped and immobilized.</p><br/><p>To restrain the remaining 4, she has to get close to where each of them is and activate the green element. But to do that, she has to get through the encirclement of Golems, and even if she manages to, it would take too much time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Sasae! You were controlling Golems in Apollon City, right?! Can\u2019t you have them retreat with that ability of yours?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt be impossible-dasu! They are not taking orders-dasu! The order authority was most likely taken away by Great Pillar-sama-dasu yo!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The one who was giving birth to the Golems is the Mother Monster, Grandma Wood.</p><br/><p>The residents called it Great Pillar-sama and it should be easy even for Sasae-chan to imagine that it possesses high influence with the Golems.</p><br/><p>But this doesn\u2019t link to a solution.</p><br/><p>They have to do something fast, or my preparations will be ending before they manage to stop them!</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-chi, you don\u2019t have a role anymore, so how about going kamikaze on those Golems and self-destruct?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen that happens, I will make sure to bring you along with me! But, it looks like this time there\u2019s no need for that.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Weaving through the encirclement of Golems and passing by the giants one after the other, a silver flash approaches the three.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren!\u201d \u201cKaren-chi!\u201d \u201cKaren-neechan!\u201d</p><br/><p>The light hero arrives at this moment.</p><ul><li>127: Outside reality</li></ul><br/><p>Karen-san arrives to where the team is.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are late, Karen! I was tired of waiting!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have found a solution, but there\u2019s a lot of problems!! For the combined element of Sasae-chi and I to bind the roots, there\u2019s the need to approach the objective to a certain degree! But for the sake of that, the Golems are a complete hindrance!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?! Have Karen and I take the front and advance as we open the path?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The four congregated and their morale increased by quite a lot.</p><br/><p>They are brimming with the will of overcoming this crisis by joining forces.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hmm, it probably won\u2019t make it in time. Haine-san will soon finish his preparations.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I felt the gaze of Karen-san from below.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san is compressing the dark matter he releases at an incredible rate. It will probably be finished soon. We most likely don\u2019t have the time to go around binding each root one by one. That\u2019s why\u2026let\u2019s bet on the last possibility.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last possibility?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s still one combination that we haven\u2019t tried out yet, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood! Then Celestis and I will hold back the Golems!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chi! Do your best, got it?! This is the Earth capital, Ishtar Blaze! This is the main stage of the earth hero! Make sure you rock it!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I hear the sound of fierce fighting from the wireless device.</p><br/><p>But I could tell that there was a side that was incredibly silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Sasae-chan. Light and earth combined element. With that, we will create a breakthrough.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood-dasu. I been smushed for a while now, so I already got the gist of it-dasu yo!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>And then, the different types of divine power were mixed, and after mixing, one new type of divine power appears.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!! What?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Golems are\u2014?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The first ones to notice the abnormality was Mirack and Celestis who were fighting at the frontline.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe movements of the Golems have stopped! What happened?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lower your guard, Mirack-chi! This might be the prelude to a new setup that large tree bastard is preparing!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>In the moment the stopped Golems began moving again\u2026their objective was already not the heroes \u2013it was the roots of Grandma Wood.</p><br/><p>Even with their big frames, the Golems jumped, used each other as footholds, and clung onto the giant roots, trying to bring them down to the ground.</p><br/><p>The Golems were indeed encircling the heroes, but most of the Golems were scattered at the surroundings of the giant tree, so the attack occurred on all the roots at the same time.</p><br/><p>In order to not hurt the people assimilated at the surface, they did it gently, but also firmly held down the roots to the ground.</p><br/><p>That means the Golems are completely following our will.</p><br/><p>Why did the Golems suddenly becomes our allies?</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026was this done by Karen and Sasae?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack reached straight to that conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cLight doesn\u2019t only provide energy, it can also be used as a way to relay information. The things we see are because we can visualize the reflected light with our eyes, and light tells us a variety of information.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, when Sasae-chi gives orders to the Golems, she pours earth divine power, right? When the light divine power and earth divine power combined, the earth divine power rode the light that is in the air, and was able to reach several Golems in far distances at the same time? Is that the combined element of light and earth?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis also joins in the deduction.</p><br/><p>Even if that\u2019s correct, the current Golems are being controlled by the highest authority holder; they should be moving on the direct orders of Mother Earth Mantle.</p><br/><p>Are you telling me they have rewritten that control? Humans have?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026really can\u2019t believe it-dasu yo.\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>From the wireless device, a small and fragile voice is transmitted.</p><br/><p>It is Sasae-chan\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolems been together with me since I be born-dasu. They been together with me since forever. They helped me, protected me. They be the friends of all the people in Ishtar Blaze-dasu yo. That\u2019s why, I really can\u2019t believe that they are enemies-dasu yo!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The hero, that lived in this land and knew of this land more than anyone else, raised her voice along with those violent emotions rising in her.</p><br/><p>That voice rode the light and reaches the far ends of the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice, Sasae-chan. Shout more. More!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Golems!! Please help us-dasu yo!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The Golems overlapped and fuse into a giant Golem.</p><br/><p>It was bigger than any Golem I have seen. To make a comparison, it is big enough to fight against the Fire Cow Phalaris and the Hydra Serpent. Moreover, fight several of them.</p><br/><p>With that sufficient frame, it holds down the roots of Grandma Wood. The people at its surface are also okay.</p><br/><p>Placing all of its weight, it felt as if it were trying to fix the rampaging roots in place.</p><br/><p>The Golems are helping the humans again.</p><br/><p>They have been relied upon so heavily, and in the end, betrayed them. In a situation where no one believed in them anymore, Sasae-chan was the only one who blindly believed in them, and that believing heart turned it into reality.</p><br/><p>A young hero; a country bumpkin hero; a hero that doesn\u2019t know things and stupidly causes problems to others. But that foolishness of hers is a foolishness that allows her to stupidly believe until the very end.</p><br/><p>A believe towards the Golems that has been with her since birth.</p><br/><p>It is because she believes in the Golems that she believed in Grandma Wood who gave birth to them; It is because she believes in the Golems that she believed in the Mother Earth God Mantle that they served.</p><br/><p>Even if she ends up not believing in those two, she still didn\u2019t stop believing in the Golems.</p><br/><p>A foolishness that will be forgotten in time as you grow up; a foolishness that comes from youth.</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan\u2019s voice reached the places that it should have reached.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously, to think that a hero would ask for help from someone else to change the situation\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that fine? Sasae-chi gives out an aura that makes you want to dote on her, right? Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a quality of a hero as well?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Even Mirack and Celestis laugh at the silly miracle that Sasae-chan created.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>I love that foolishness that allowed for this miracle.</p><br/><p>As someone who loves humans, loving only a part of the humans that I like would make that love of mine a lie after all.</p><br/><p>And so, I finished what was in my hand right in time.</p><br/><p>A compressed to the very limits dark matter; a \u2018Micro Black Hole\u2019.</p><br/><p>I actually didn\u2019t want to use it.</p><br/><p>The strongest destruction method I possess as the Dark God. This is something that is originally used in order to reset a world that isn\u2019t favorable.</p><br/><p>By reducing its power to a trillion times, I get the thing that is in my hands.</p><br/><p>But even with that, it is still hard to use this technique with my human body.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Even so, this is still plenty enough to erase half of your body!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Giant tree!</p><br/><p>Thanks to the heroes, the fear of dragging humans into it has completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s already no need to worry.</p><br/><p>I stabilize my aim and release it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!!\u201d</p><br/><p>But, at the place where I aimed at, at the light brown trunk of Grandma Wood that covers my whole view, there was one part that was shining fluorescently.</p><br/><p>That shine had the figure of a human.</p><br/><p>It was the Fairy of Mother Earth Mantle.</p><ul><li>128: Black Demise</li></ul><br/><p>Mother Earth God, Mantle.</p><br/><p>The very culprit of this disaster has showed up again.</p><br/><p>I can understand the reason of it.</p><br/><p>She knows that she has been checkmated.</p><br/><p>I take away the wireless device from my ear, and throw it away.</p><br/><p>\u201cMantle, move away.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Even if we are far away, if we overlap the wavelength of Gods, we can have a conversation plenty well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you think there won\u2019t be any problems in being crushed because you are in the temporal form of a Fairy, you are heavily mistaken, you know?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, Entropy-san?! Didn\u2019t you praise me?! Didn\u2019t you acknowledge that what I was doing was splendid?! And yet, are you going to reject everything now?!\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>Mantle\u2019s objection was painful.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone will be happy! Humans don\u2019t have to fight, don\u2019t have to work. They can push away all the troublesome things aside, and live forever! In return, I receive soul energy that is similar to that of prayer energy. Everyone gets something out of it, and no one suffers! Why are you getting in the way of such a splendid thing?!\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u201cMantle\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t notice how scary you could be.</p><br/><p>Without understanding the other side of that frailty of yours, I thoughtlessly praised you, and as a result, promoted your rampage.</p><br/><p>Inflation most likely noticed that madness that was hiding inside of you, and in order for it to not surface, she was always careful about it and pushing it down.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s probably the reason for Mantle\u2019s usual weak demeanor she normally shows.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry. I was unable to truly understand you. Without understanding everything, I looked at only a part of you. I could only appreciate a part of you that was convenient for me. I am sorry. I am truly sorry!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEntropy-san, what are you saying?\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Mantle, happiness is probably not that simple of a subject. Just what is true happiness? An answer to that won\u2019t easily come out. Everyone gets troubled by that question, and each individual has a completely different answer to it. That\u2019s why there is no true answer, not now, and not ever.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Making someone else happy.</p><br/><p>That might be meddlesome, but as a wish, I have to admit that a wish like that is not wrong in the least.</p><br/><p>But to ignore the will of the other party and push your own answer at someone else, I think it is an irreparable sin.</p><br/><p>Rather than obtaining happiness, thinking about what is happiness; for humans, the search for that in itself is important.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, Mantle, I can\u2019t forgive you, the you that is trying to steal the right of humans to think. I will be erasing that very action of yours. Just like how humans certainly die, just like how demise will always occur in the millenias of this world, right now, I will\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u2026Provide that demise to you and your subordinate</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavily decreased [Black Hole Cannon]\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>From my hand, something that was as small as a grain was shot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will say it again, Mantle. Move away.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Right now, it was docilely flying in one direction, and in the moment it arrived at the trunk of the giant tree, it does as it was set up to do beforehand\u2026</p><br/><p>It swallowed everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaa!! Whaaat?!!\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>The dark matter, that was compressed to the very limits, increased the gravity due to its mass, and when it reached a certain critical point, it turns into a black hole that releases unlimited gravity.</p><br/><p>When that happens, nothing can escape. Whether it is something with substance or not, everything will get caught in its gravity, and be thrown into the depths of darkness.</p><br/><p>Even the earth Mother Monster that possesses the most mass in this whole world had its wooden body creak conspicuously, and even the very creaking sound got swallowed along with the air, got crushed, broken, and disappears inside the darkness.</p><br/><p>And then, the other things as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIyaaaa!! Why?! Why is my body as well?! Even my body is being dragged by the gravity~~~!\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>Mantle\u2019s desperate scream.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I warned you to move away from there.</p><br/><p>This last resort of I -the Dark God Entropy- is not something sweet that would ignore things just because they don\u2019t have an actual body.</p><br/><p>A body that has nothing to do with mass\u2026 It can even swallow the soul of a God.</p><br/><p>In my conversation with the Fire God Nova, I told him that \u2018I can\u2019t seal Gods\u2019.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t seal, but I can erase them.</p><br/><p>To the depths of the darkness inside the Black Hole, that is.</p><br/><p>This power that I didn\u2019t use on even Nova and Coacervate; to think I would be forced to use it in you.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.You are the epitome of pity, Mother Earth God, Mantle.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>If I had been more careful in my choice of words, we might have entered an understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaaaaaa!!! Noooooo!!\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>Swallowing even the cries of the Mother Earth God, the Black Hole in time swallows even itself, and disappears without leaving a trace.</p><br/><p>Just like how I set it up to do \u2013it doesn\u2019t leave anything behind.</p><br/><p>Most of the giant tree was swallowed, and excluding the lower part that was gouged out and was left as just a stump\u2026it didn\u2019t have a single leaf remaining.</p><br/><p>If I had set up the range, I could have made it so that the outside didn\u2019t have a single wound, but the inside would not even have dust left.</p><br/><p>My ultimate destructive technique.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to use it ever if possible.</p><br/><p>But because of it, we were able to win this time.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t only the power of the Black Hole.</p><br/><p>The four heroes that came at the perfect time and did a splendid job at supporting me.</p><br/><p>The victory was theirs.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>And like this, the curtains to the battle in Ishtar Blaze closed.</p><br/><p>The people that were assimilated into the roots of Grandma Wood were cut out one by one in time, and we managed to save them all without sacrificing anyone.</p><br/><p>Separated from the tree bark, they regained their consciousness right after, and were able to operate just like before without change.</p><br/><p>In terms of humans, there were no lives that were lost. In that sense, it can be said to be a blessing. But in exchange, the damage to the land was terrible.</p><br/><p>Because of the rampaging of Grandma Wood, most of the buildings collapsed, the ground was broken, as if this were what was left after a natural disaster.</p><br/><p>The sight was so terrible that it made me think it would be next to impossible to return it to being one of the five major cities.</p><br/><p>But that almost impossible task is something that humans have to overcome.</p><br/><p>No matter what difficulties are in front of them, to think about it and overcome it is what makes a human.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-124-125-old-strong-one\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 124-125 - Old Strong One\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-129-130-rebirth-of-the-earth-capital\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 129-130 - Rebirth of the Earth capital\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236297\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

The city where the Water Church\u2019s headquarters are located.\u201d</p><br/><p>What a beautiful scenery this city has.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s canals and waterways here and there in the city, and on top of that, there\u2019s several tourist-looking people that have been passing by us on board of gondolas.</p><br/><p>\u201cHydra Ville is a port city build on the sea. Because of it, within the five Churches, this is the wealthiest one.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the time the ethereal technology developed, their amount of goods transportation and the scope of it has increased drastically, and its worth as a trade port has increased drastically as well. In those points, the Water Church dealt with it in a flexible manner. The tolerance of ethereal machines is number one in this place.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cCargo ships that run with ethereal energy have been created, so there\u2019s no need for the assistance of the waves and wind anymore after all. But I like this city as a sightseeing city, you know. Those gondolas are incredibly cute.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard that the maintenance and the sightseeing places are mainly managed by the Water Church.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Even if I compare it to the few places I have seen until now, I can tell that the Water capital, Hydra Ville, was build with a clear policy in mind.</p><br/><p>But this sagaciousness\u2026it smells a lot like that person\u2026</p><br/><p>Water God, Coacervate.</p><br/><p>He was a cunning and clever God. In the Genesis era, the one who formed the network of five Gods and defeated me was him.</p><br/><p>And this place is the Water Church\u2019s headquarters, and the church that follows Coacervate.</p><br/><p>Are the believers of the churches influenced by the God that they worship?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And so, we are going to go meet the water hero Celestis now but\u2026how do you plan on meeting her?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the headquarters of the Water Church, the water grand church. It is normal for the hero to be there, and even if she is not, we should be able to obtain some sort of clue.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like in my case, you guys really like to charge in without making any appointments\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Ignoring what Mirack said, I confirm the map in order to head to the Water Church\u2019s headquarters.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, the shortest route would be to go straight here and\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Haine-san, they say this viaduct is a famous place! Let\u2019s go check it out!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t here to sightsee, you know?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Is what I say when\u2026</p><br/><p>*Dondoko dondondokodon dondokodondondon*</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>*Dondoko dondondokodon dondokodondondon*</p><br/><p>A strange noise was approaching from somewhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with this noise? A musical instrument\u2026 A drum?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, at the canal!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Looking at the place Karen-san is pointing at, I could see a drum floating on the water\u2026no, that\u2019s not it. There were a lot of drums on top of a big ship, and these drums were being beaten by many men.</p><br/><p>The ship was wide, enough to occupy half of the canal. The gondolas that were passing by its side were in a tight state. They might crash with a single mistake.</p><br/><p>The ship\u2019s height was also proportional to its width, and it was so high that even us who were looking at a slightly elevated area had to look up. And on top of it, there\u2019s men beating drums.</p><br/><p>*Dondoko dondondokodon dondokodondondon*</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell we would understand this!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Not a single one of us understood what was going on.</p><br/><p>And, without a single care about our confusion, the situation headed onto an even more confusing one.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone~! I will be intruding-nyaa~~!\u201d</p><br/><p>A loud voice, that felt as if it was pressing onto the inside of my head, pierced my eardrums.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the men that were beating the drums, a part that we were unable to see from our position had lifted high up -probably by the use of some sort of mechanism- and became a stage, moreover, there was one girl standing on top of that stage\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water hero, Celestis?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>There was no difference from the poster. That\u2019s why I could tell. Things like the sleeve and the skirt\u2019s hem were fluttering about, and the places that must be concealed are dangerously open; a sly outfit.</p><br/><p>With only slight movements, the outfit moves a lot which attracts the eyes. And as a finishing blow, that sparkling smile of hers, it was as if she was utilizing 100% of her face\u2019s muscles.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn announcement! I have come to announce the live that will be held tomorrow~~!\u201d (Celestis)</p><figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_6471\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aqua?!</figcaption></figure><br/><p>*Dondoko dondondokodon dondokodondondon*</p><br/><p>The drums were interluding in good tempo.</p><br/><p>\u201cCleaning everyone\u2019s gloom, the pure stream water songstress, hero Celestis and her many drummers-de~~su!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>*Dokodokodokodokodokodoko!!!*</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand anything anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn additional public performance has been decided earlier, and from tomorrow on to three days, there will be live concerts!! This time\u2019s venue is incredible, you know! The stage is floating on the sea! No doubt it will be become a specialty of Hydra Ville! If you don\u2019t come see the sea stage, you will regret it for the rest of your life! If you don\u2019t come\u2026Celes-tan will smush you into soup!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Yup, not one word at all.</p><ul><li>40: Emergency Announcement</li></ul><br/><p>\u201c[Flame Burst]!\u201d</p><br/><p>A hellfire attacked the advertising ship mercilessly.</p><br/><p>The culprit is, of course, this person that controls fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-san?! What are you doing?! Are you an idiot?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me! You are also unable to take anymore of this odd atmosphere, right?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s true but\u2026even if that\u2019s the case, turning into an arsonist because of that is questionable as a hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. For her, this doesn\u2019t even amount to a fart.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>When I look, the fire, that was supposed to be chaotically spreading in the place, was devoured by what seemed like an even bigger monster and was extinguished.</p><br/><p>That giant monster that devoured this fire was\u2026water.</p><br/><p>The water below the canal rose up like a snake, lunged onto the fire, and devoured it completely.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What\u2019s this, seriously\u2026 Even if you get incredibly excited, please don\u2019t throw things to the stage, customer-sama\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>On top of the stage, the beautiful girl fluttered her blue garment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat garment, that looks like a dancing outfit at a glance, is actually the strongest divine relic of the Water Church, rivaling Karen\u2019s holy sword Saint-George and my Fire Fist Barbarossa.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>You serious?</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, looking at the affinities between our elements, that person is my worst opponent. Water extinguishes fire. For her who is the water hero, extinguishing that level of flames is nothing.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack looked as if she had snapped, but it seems she actually thought it out before attacking.</p><br/><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t have attacked if she didn\u2019t snap in the first place. Well, it can\u2019t be helped. Faced against such a mental corroding attack\u2026</p><br/><p>And so, this flashy fire and water clash gathered even more of the attention from the people, and it also drew attention to us.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, isn\u2019t that\u2026 the \u2018fire hero, Katack Mirack-sama\u2019? And there\u2019s even the \u2018light hero-sama\u2019 too. I am from Apollon City, so I know!\u201d</p><br/><p>The attention is increasing.</p><br/><p>Now then, how do we calm this down. It is not on the level of Celestis, but Mirack and Karen-san can also be considered the face of their respective church.</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t want to have us retreat in a way that would worsen the view the populace has on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone~~ the special guests have appeared~~!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Once again, the loud voice from the stage resounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this time\u2019s live stage performance, we will have the other churches\u2019 heroes appearing as a special event! I wanted to keep it a secret until the appointed day, but I can\u2019t hold it any longer, so I will be spilling the beans~~~!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhaaaaat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t the only one surprised.</p><br/><p>The surrounding local people, the tourists, and the general populace had their excitement rise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou kidding?!\u201d \u201cSeriously?!\u201d \u201cA collaboration work with 3 heroes?!\u201d \u201cI will definitely go see it! Can I get tickets now?!\u201d \u201cI was planning on returning today, but I will cancel my train and prolong it!\u201d \u201cEven if I have to work as a beverage seller there, I will definitely go there and see it!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The street corners of Hydra Ville had become the very definition of excitement.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karen-san, Mirack, and I accompanied Celestis and arrived at the Water Church\u2019s headquarters. If we stayed there, the ruckus would prolong who knows for how long.</p><br/><p>This is supposed to be the office of the water hero, but just now, when we passed through the door, the room plate said \u2018dressing room\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are two heroes doing here in my island? If you came here to pick a fight, I call pass. I will soon be having a live performance after all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your way of speaking is normal.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? If I don\u2019t divide work and private life, my shoulders would grow stiff. If my body gets stiffer, it would affect my performance as well.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if she is serious about her job or she isn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>And Mirack, who was brought here without a single care of her opinion, was showing clear dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hmph, I have heard about your indecent side job for some time now, but I didn\u2019t think it would be this indecent. Seeing it with my own eyes almost dislocated my jaw.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen dislocate your jaw already. If you are able to do that, I can hire you as a comedian.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes, fire hero-san that gets heated immediately. By the way, why are you together with the light hero? Didn\u2019t you girls not get along?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words of Celestis made Mirack shut up in an instant.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Right now, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to imagine it, but the relationship of Karen-san and Mirack was as bad as that of a cat and dog.</p><br/><p>But well, it was all Mirack being the wild dog here though. Those words that made her remember this, made even Mirack falter.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026W-We formed an alliance not that long ago.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah? Alliance? Seriously?! That\u2019s incredible. So that means the light and fire churches have joined arms?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the churches are not involved. It was an arbitrary decision by Karen and I, but even so, we thought it would be effective in dealing with the monsters you see.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 But it is still incredible. In the current heroes, you guys were the ones who didn\u2019t get along the most, and yet, from all the people, you girls formed an alliance.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The continuous mention of \u2018not getting along\u2019 by Celestis, was making Mirack\u2019s face sour.</p><br/><p>The person herself doesn\u2019t have any ill-intentions, but those words were like body blows that were stacking the damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, the reason you came here was to give me this report?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san took over for Mirack who was quite weakened already.</p><br/><p>Karen-san has been maintaining silence since the moment she entered the room. That, on the contrary, made me have a vague fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Karen as well, it has been a while~. But well, even if I say so, this is our first time having a proper chat? The rumours of the good-girl hero at the light church have reached my ears as well though.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The reason I intruded on you today was because, Celestis-san, I have an important favor to ask of you.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease stop being an idol.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cDirect approach?!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirack and I both exclaimed in unison.</p><ul><li>41: An Idol\u2019s pride</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cHah? What are you saying?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The request of Karen-san was so straightforward that Celestis visibly frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour activities are having a bad influence on our cities. I want you to stop them.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san didn\u2019t change her expression and didn\u2019t display her emotions.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Celestis\u2019 reaction was clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I have been asking, what is it you are saying! My songs are providing a bad influence?! That\u2019s not possible! Even if I look like this, I am still a hero, you know! I won\u2019t sing unless my fans are happy!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, you see\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>To think Celestis would be enraged in such a way. It looks like she has her own concerns regarding her activities as an idol, but at this rate, their thoughts will not connect at all.</p><br/><p>I have no choice but to step in here. And then, I supplemented the parts that were lacking in the explanation of Karen-san.</p><br/><p>About how the popularity of the idol Celestis was having a drastical rise, and with that, the proliferation of her fans in Apollon City and Muspelheim has exploded. This turned directly into most of them joining the Water Church.</p><br/><p>This conflicts with the agreement of proselytizing prohibition that was formed between the churches.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see. So that\u2019s how it is.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>After saying this much, Celestis finally reached an understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, my popularity is on the verge of stealing your fans, so you came here to ask me to stop it. Plain girls have it tough huh.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san firmly answers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind your idol activities in itself. The problem is that it is connecting with proselytizing. That part is making this problem complicated. So, I think there\u2019s the need to revise this situation. For the sake of that, the methods that can be taken are two.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cStop being an idol, or stop being a hero. I see, so that\u2019s what you mean by the \u2018stop being an idol\u2019 huh.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis says this as if lightly warding off the pressing of Karen-san.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Mirack stands shoulder to shoulder with Karen-san and emphasizes the criticism.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also of the same opinion. That\u2019s why I am here. In the first place, Celestis, even when you are standing as a hero, you are doing a hobby like being an idol. Aren\u2019t you ashamed? If you are a hero, you should devote yourself to your main job as a hero. If you want to devote yourself into being an idol, you should pass over the seat of hero to someone else. The current you can\u2019t seat in both and are half-assed.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The fire hero and the light hero; these two heroes were protesting together, so the water hero couldn\u2019t ignore it.</p><br/><p>That was the objective when both of them came here but, will that show any effectiveness?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you stupid? That\u2019s quite the shallow thinking you have there.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It had no effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I will ask you this as well. What is the job of a hero?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026protecting the people from the threat of monsters\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct, but that\u2019s not all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis smiles suggestively.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroes\u2026fight monsters as the representatives of the church. And then, with that, they show the power of the church to them. Heroes are the face of the church, the standard bearers. Seeing that all of the five current heroes are teenage girls around their 15 makes it clear, don\u2019t you think?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Eh, is that true?</p><br/><p>The light, fire, and water heroes here are all girls, but well, now that she mentions it, if they are going to use someone as their face, rather than a man, it would be more appealing with a cute girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, in order to serve my job as the church\u2019s face, I am doing my very best. That\u2019s what an idol is. Fortunately, my fans have accepted this, and my popularity has risen. My popularity reaching outside the Water capital just means that my efforts came at play there.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then, the other churches\u2014!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that troubles the fire and light, that just means you are lacking in effort. Conforming with just defeating monsters. You are lacking awareness as a representative of the church. You don\u2019t have a clear policy and are simply working without a single thought as the face of the church. All of this just means that it is now biting you in the back, that\u2019s all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Karen-san and Mirack were unable to say anything back.</p><br/><p>That was akin to admitting that what Celestis said was correct.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-san\u2026you looked like a regular idiot, but you were actually thinking about things properly huh.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with this man, so rude on our first meeting! Or more like, seriously, who are you?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I have been following along until now like normal, but it seems Celestis had not even acknowledged my presence.</p><br/><p>With a small self-introduction, I advance the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Celestis-san won\u2019t show self-restraint in your idol activities and won\u2019t show consideration to the other churches, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Why does a person who puts in the effort have to show consideration to people who don\u2019t put the effort?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I see. Understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it can\u2019t be helped. We are leaving!\u201d (Haine)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-36-38-idol-hero\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 36-38 - Idol Hero\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-42-43-if-pushing-doesn%E2%80%99t-work-pull\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 42-43 - If pushing doesn\u2019t work, pull\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236261\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

But no matter how much light she releases from her holy sword, it doesn\u2019t shake the perfect defense of Ates.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unsightly, Karen-san. Making your holy sword sparkle so much is boundlessly vulgar. Do you want to save that much the heroes of the other churches that are your enemies?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are not enemies! They are comrades that have overcome dangers together!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>She once again makes the holy sword Saint-George shine intensely. However, that sword slash was easily deflected by the tip of Ates\u2019 spear.</p><br/><p>She makes the holy sword shine again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow stubborn!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the other four were more and more cornered at a critical point.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgah!!\u201d \u201cHiiiaaaa!!\u201d \u201cKugh!!\u201d \u201cDasu~~!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>At some point in time, Mirack, Celestis, Hyue, and Sasae-chan had been cornered at the center of the stage and had become one cluster of people.</p><br/><p>And the previous heroes are encircling them.</p><br/><p>It was as if the four inside and the four outside were drawing a circle.</p><br/><p>In other words, the current heroes have been surrounded by the previous heroes and had nowhere to run.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is as far as you go. It was so one-sided that it was boring.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly. I didn\u2019t know our juniors were such let-downs.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it be going ta be like this, I didn\u2019t even need ta participate.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hihihi.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>What are they saying. They utilized the elemental affinities to one-sidedly attack them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you understand now, Mirack?! This is how your naive thinking of cooperation will end up like! Relying on others all the time, you are now paying for not training yourself!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cSis!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The big sister is one-sidedly blaming the little sister disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s required from heroes is strength. The strength to wipe out hundreds of monsters on your own. It looks like you, who were playing around as an idol, didn\u2019t even reach that point though.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cSarasa!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The gazes between the new and old water heroes were also dangerous.</p><br/><p>The encirclement was also slowly closing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell ya little chicks~. The meaning of the strength that heroes should possess. There be strength that ya absolutely can\u2019t obtain by depending on others.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cHihihihi~~.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Mirack and the others of the current heroes team had their back against each other and were facing the previous heroes that were approaching them from all sides.</p><br/><p>That formation when seen from above was like the inside circle is made up of the current heroes and the outside circle was made up of the previous heroes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Thanks for the sermon.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing as saddening as listening to the sermon of idiots.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Being told such a bold thing, the closing feet of Sarasa stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cTotally agree, Celestis. People that don\u2019t even know where they are standing at and still speak their opinion to others can\u2019t be described as anything but idiots.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack, you bastard!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Kyouka also stops her feet at the sharp abusive words of her junior.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis must be what they mean by you can\u2019t dress up your teeth huh. I am not that good with words, so I will stay silent.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cI pass too-dasu~.\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The four haven\u2019t given up.</p><br/><p>Even when they are cornered in a totally disadvantageous situation\u2026no wait, is this situation really as bad as it seems?</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well, grannies. The reason why you were able to do as you wished until now was because your elemental affinities were fitting more than perfectly. For your side, that is.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as we fought individually, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to overturn that disadvantage. However, now it is different.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause we four have gathered now after all.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cDasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, it is exactly because the four were dispersed that they were being suppressed by the bad compatibility of their opponent.</p><br/><p>But now that they have been driven to the center and the four are in a cluster, there\u2019s no need to force themselves to fight against the disadvantageous opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t noticed yet? Normally, the moment we ended up in a cluster, you should notice that your turn has already finished. Being drunk in your advantage, you couldn\u2019t even see the battle formation. You are more muscle-heads than I thought!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cEnduring has ended. From here on, it is time for\u2026the counterattack!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The circle of the current heroes made a 180 degrees turn.</p><br/><p>At that moment, my brain created an image of a safe dial that has been turned in the memory area, and the safe opening.</p><br/><p>What was drawn in the two sides of the previous heroes and the current heroes was\u2026that by doing that rotation to the dial, the opponents of each one had changed.</p><br/><p>Mirack\u2019s opponent was the proxy wind hero, Brastor Juo; Celestis\u2019 opponent was the previous fire hero, Kyouka; Sasae-chan\u2019s opponent was the previous water hero, Sarasa; Hyue\u2019s opponent was the previous earth hero, Yoneko-san.</p><br/><p>By simply doing a half-rotation, the elemental advantages had cleanly turned!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad! Quickly\u2014!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo slow!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The current heroes attack their new opponents at once.</p><br/><p>It was a complete turnaround.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! Dual fire fist, [Flame Burst]!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cNot enough, not enough! If you want to break my \u2018Water Blade\u2019, you will need to grow at least 10 more arms!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis vs the previous fire hero Kyouka.</p><br/><p>The surge that the Miki-Moses created had swallowed the fire whirl along with Kyouka.</p><br/><p>At the same time, in a different battle\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow impudent! With the \u2018Water Blade\u2019 of my water folding fan, Dahyu, I will\u2014!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cSobo-chan and Yorishiro-sama said the exact same thing-dasu\u2026 \u2018When doing something, do it thoroughly\u2019.\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan vs the previous water hero, Sarasa.</p><br/><p>The swung earth scythe easily sliced apart the high water pressure blade and approached Sarasa.</p><br/><p>\u201cEeek!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other sides were similar to this, and that clear turnaround had been witnessed by the other pair that was watching from afar; Karen-san and Ates.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose idiots!! I told them that much that they should finish the battle while they were still isolated, and yet\u2026!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, it really was you people who did something.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san calmly approaches Ates.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows. Don\u2019t know what you are talking about. I am just saying that they are an incompetent bunch of trash that can\u2019t utilize a chance to its best.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder about that. Do you really think that Mirack-chan and the others coincidentally gathered in the middle? What if they feigned as if they were cornered and skillfully led them?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s just gathering them in the middle, it wouldn\u2019t be complicated at all. However, Mirack and the others moved in such a smooth and coordinated manner to their advantageous elemental affinity sides.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way they could have led and gathered them without having planned it.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible. In order to do that, they all have to be same in mind, moreover, there\u2019s the need for someone to be giving the orders from outside\u2026ah!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates makes an expression as if she noticed something.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san! Could it be that the reason why you were making your holy sword Saint-George sparkle for a while now was\u2026!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was something we all agreed on beforehand. So that we can quickly coordinate even if we were to be divided.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>In other words, with the instructions send out the light from the holy sword of Karen-san, they made an act of being cornered, and were able to deftly gather.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is teamwork. You will be falling by the very thing that you people looked down upon so much!\u201d (Karen)</p><ul><li>189: No breaks</li></ul><br/><p>A shrill voice filled with agitation reverberated.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it has come to this, it is time for melee! Get so close and personal that elemental affinities won\u2019t matter!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Hearing what Kyouka said, I was clear of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have won.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>It looks like Yorishiro at my side had the same belief.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Bring it to a melee and push without caring about the elemental affinities.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the other previous heroes also gathered and took a close formation.</p><br/><p>Our current heroes team didn\u2019t stop them and they themselves take a close formation as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cFools! With this, your chance of winning have disappeared!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think that, Sis?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack calmly asks the reason behind the boastful tone of Kyouka.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to even think about it! As expected, in here, we who hold the seniority are stronger. We should have clashed straight on from the very beginning without thinking about boring stuff like elemental affinities!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So she says. What should we do, everyone?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis glances at Mirack, Sasae-chan, and Celestis; and they all nod.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cWe accept the challenge!\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201c-Dasu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The current heroes and the previous heroes; this time, they really are going to be clashing as a team.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, the inexperienced Gonbee Sasae, will be the first one stepping ta the front-dasu!! Rest in peace!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The first one to spearhead was Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>Brandishing a giant scythe that\u2019s bigger than her body, she charges towards the enemy lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo naive~, Sasae-chan.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>The one who obstructed her way from the very front was an earth hero just like her, Yoneko-san.</p><br/><p>With a scythe that is smaller than that of the Earth Scythe, she properly stops Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith such shabby bloodlust like that, even when ya are an adult, ya won\u2019t be overcoming me, ya know~? It will disappoint Sobo-san.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now I be fine with that-dasu! A different person will be overcoming Yoneko-neechan-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The next instant, a transparent something clashed onto Yoneko-san and sends her flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch!! What was that?!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>It was the air bullet that the wind hero, Hyue, had shot at long-range.</p><br/><p>Since this is a match, she must have restraint the power. Because if she hadn\u2019t, Yoneko-san would have gone right to the afterworld with that one shot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI be leaving mah back to Hyue-neechan-dasu!! CHARGE!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The extreme frontliner Sasae-chan, and the backliner assist of Hyue.</p><br/><p>A really ideal role allotment.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026With the support of a wind element, things get difficult~. Someone, please help out?\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>There was someone in the previous heroes team that answered this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue\u2026\u2026I will crush you\u2026..\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>The proxy wind hero, the apparition-like woman called Brastor Juo. She hunts with her wind gun rebellion, Koumei.</p><br/><p>Compared to the wind long gun of Hyue, the wind gun rebellion of Juo has several tens.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it normally, she wouldn\u2019t have a chance of winning, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c[Flame Burst]!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The fire dragon that Mirack gave rise to had easily driven away the balls of the wind gun rebellion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWide area of effect attacks are a trait of the fire element! Added to that, there\u2019s the affinities between fire and wind! You chose the wrong opponents!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat goes for you too, Mirack!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>The previous fire hero Kyouka also gave rise to a \u2018Flame Burst\u2019. Moreover, due to it being released from the two fire knuckles in both of her hands, the heat and power were practically double.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow disappointing, Mirack! You can only control one fire fist, so you are easily pushed back by me! What\u2019s with that shabby \u2018Flame Burst\u2019? That fire dragon has so many openings and it is more of a worm!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>It is true that the fire dragon of Mirack had openings here and there, and compared to that, the one Kyouka released came from both of her arms, so the two of them could cover the openings of each other.</p><br/><p>Kyouka\u2019s fire dragon certainly looked more impregnable than that of Mirack\u2019s fire dragon, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for the rudeness, Sis Kyouka, but the reason why my \u2018Flame Burst\u2019 has openings is because they are necessary. In order to let the attacks of my comrades pass.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Several water bullets pass through the openings of the fire dragon \u2018Flame Burst\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>And they erase the \u2018Flame Burst\u2019 of Kyouka in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>The one who released those was of course the water hero Celestis.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice! Don\u2019t you think we are gradually becoming a good combination?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say such provoking things!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack unrestrainedly released vicious fire attacks and secured a safe zone; Sasae-chan jumped into the enemy lines and dealt fatal damage; Hyue is assisting them from the backlines and covering their blind spots; and Celestis is in the middle lines freely changing to maintain coordination.</p><br/><p>But those are not the only components that form their teamwork.</p><br/><p>Even when outside their formation, Karen-san was holding down her opponent Ates while using light signals to provide instructions.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why the other four know about the movements of the others and can fight only looking at the front.</p><br/><p>The control tower, Karen-san; the space securer, Mirack; the frontliner, Sasae-chan; the backline supporter, Hyue; the one serving as the middle and holding them together, Celestis.</p><br/><p>I would even dare say that their teamwork is already reaching the point of perfection.</p><br/><p>And compared to that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSarasa! Sarasa! What are you doing?! You are supposed to be dealing with the water one, right?! Don\u2019t dilly-dally and crush her already!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you ordering me around? The reason why you are in trouble is because you are weak, right? Wait, hyaaaa!! What are you doing?! Are you thinking of shooting the back of your allies?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026..You are\u2026at fault for spacing out in place\u2026\u2026More importantly, quickly extinguish that fire. With that in the way, I can\u2019t control the wind gun rebellion properly.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares~. The shooting of the Wind-san on the other side is so persistent that I can\u2019t move the way I want~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u2026The previous heroes were in an atrocious state.</p><br/><p>They only move with their own self in mind, so it creates friction. And the current heroes are taking advantage of that like crazy.</p><br/><p>They are not trying to cover for each other\u2019s weaknesses, shave off the strong points of each other like crazy, and are unable to show even half of their actual strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cEi, move back, useless bunch! Now that it has come to this, I will wipe them out by myself!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the one who should be moving back, you useless trash of a truant! I can easily take care of those teenagers myself!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Shut up\u2026useless people.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery single one of \u2018em be useless~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>The front of the previous heroes had completely fallen.</p><br/><p>They had turned into plain piled up trash.</p><br/><p>Mirack and Celestis, Sasae-chan and Hyue; they respectively held hands and were pointing their hands like guns.</p><br/><p>Combined elements\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c[Steam Explosion]!!\u201d\u201d (Mirack+Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cSand Worm!!\u201d\u201d (Sasae+Hyue) \u201c-Dasu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Double attack of combined elements.</p><br/><p>An explosion that occurs by evaporating a large amount of water in an instant and a sand storm had blown away the previous heroes that were unsightly bickering with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cGyaaaaaaaa~~~~~~~~!!!!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><ul><li>190: Explosion</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cWhen they began to crumble, it turned around instantly-desu wa ne.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>At the battle stage, I see four previous heroes lying down uncouthly.</p><br/><p>The victor is practically decided already.</p><br/><p>Four of the previous heroes are out of commision already. The one remaining is Ates who is in a one on one versus Karen-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut to think it would be decided so easily. It looks like the difference in experience has shown.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cExperience?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro makes a wondering face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the contrary? If we talk about the accumulated experience, Ates-san and the others should have an overwhelming amount because of their seniority, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen talking about experience, the quality is more important than the quantity, Yorishiro.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san and the others have fought several times against opponents that would make them say \u2018this is impossible\u2019.</p><br/><p>The Fire Cow Phalaris; the Great Sea Dragon, Hydra Serpent; Grandma Wood; Beelzebub; and the Demon Lord, Raphael. They are all dreadnought level and normal humans wouldn\u2019t even be able to oppose them.</p><br/><p>Karen-san and the others have defeated those kind of opponents while all tattered.</p><br/><p>The mercilessness of the dangers they have tasted are different.</p><br/><p>It is exactly because those girls have overcome those dangers that they won\u2019t crumble over just any danger that rolls on them. They have obtained that tenacity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Even if their weaknesses were completely attacked right at the beginning of the match, but the girls did a good job in enduring.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were at a cliff standing on their tiptoes though.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Compared to that, the previous heroes have worked as heroes for a long time, but the only things they have fought are the mass-produced monsters of the Mother Monsters.</p><br/><p>Maybe they didn\u2019t experience any true danger as they finished their duty as heroes?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why those girls were weak once they were cornered. Without knowing about a way to endure in extreme situations, they crumbled instantly. It truly is a show of their difference in experience.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOne first-rate experience surpasses a hundred common experiences. It is the same as male experience-desu wa ne. I also don\u2019t need experience with any man aside from Haine-san-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>I am not talking about that.</p><br/><p>At any rate, the match is settled with this.</p><br/><p>This is the victory of the current heroes team.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, what\u2019s the matter, Ates-san?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I ask this of the previous hero, Ates, that is standing alone in the battle stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only remaining previous hero is you. Just like how you said just a few moments ago, want to be ganged up?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Mirack and the others were already running towards them and they had surrounded Ates with all five of them.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Ates\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fuh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Went out of battle stance and lowered her spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around. I don\u2019t want to do something as tiring as fighting a one versus five. I hate fights I can\u2019t win.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>All five current heroes made an expression as if they had been hit by that statement.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is the victory, I will give it to you girls. In this occasion, that is.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Leaving these words behind, Ates enters the entrance gate she came out from before and left the battle stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What be the meaning of this-dasu\u2026\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, but the previous light hero has fled from battle. The remaining previous heroes are all down. In other words, this is\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cOur win!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>At the same time, ear-shattering cheers were made by the audience.</p><br/><p>This was exactly what announced the result of the battle.</p><br/><p>For a moment I was wondering what would happen, but as expected of those girls, they were able to obtain victory with their own power.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow referee, the match is over! Announce our victory already!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Referee?</p><br/><p>Now that she mentions it, there was one more person aside from the 9 heroes there; a tenth person was there.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that the announcer girl that appeared at the very beginning?</p><br/><p>Or more like, there was a referee in this kind of match? What was she even refereeing?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as you explained in the beginning, you are the one that judges when they can\u2019t fight anymore, right?

The Founder ordered that we should consider this as our last defense line and to desperately protect it.\u201d</p><br/><p>That means if the monsters pass this line, they will invade the Fire capital huh.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust seven kilometers?! Are you telling me the lookouts didn\u2019t notice them until they were so close?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka, who had accompanied me, asked a question that was basically a reprimand.</p><br/><p>Sis had returned to her post as a previous hero, so she has a status on the same level as me in terms of battle strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that\u2026according to the report of the lookouts, they said that monsters suddenly began appearing from the plain out of nowhere!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe total of monsters is at a glance around 500. Moreover, they are apparently increasing in numbers as they advance. At this rate, by the time they reach the city, there\u2019s the chance that the numbers will have increased to the thousands!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka and I were doubting our ears at the report of the fire militant.</p><br/><p>Impossible!</p><br/><p>Monsters popping out from nowhere? I have never heard of that before!</p><br/><p>But until Haine told us about the Mother Monsters being the source of the monsters, it had been a mystery as to where the monsters came from after all.</p><br/><p>Trying to measure the Demons with the common sense of humans is a plain waste of time.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood. What\u2019s the current damage?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately\u2026the place where the monsters popped out(?) from was faraway from the rural area of Muspelheim and there were no travellers, so there hasn\u2019t been any casualties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, we have made a number of fire militants fly around in their flying machines to notify of the danger to the settlements. With this, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone mistakenly wandering there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay, that\u2019s fine then.</p><br/><p>Now then, what\u2019s left is to do something about that army of monsters!</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, it is for certain that the monsters are heading to Muspelheim.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Monsters attacking humans is an instinctive nature of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we allow them to invade Muspelheim, there will definitely be casualties, moreover, there will be many. We will make sure not a single monster reaches Muspelheim. Even at the cost of our life, don\u2019t let a single monster in!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201dYeaaahh!!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>My speech made every single one of the fire militants in the area heated up.</p><br/><p>Looks like there\u2019s plenty enough spirit here.</p><br/><p>As expected of the best elites in the church -the Ignis Militant corps!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, we will begin acting! Relay this to all members! We will go forward and confront the monsters!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Onee-sama, if the other side is heading towards us, wouldn\u2019t it be better to confront them from this defense line?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Braidley and Glassfin, from the group of three girls that accompanied us, asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that in terms of tactics, that\u2019s exactly the case -but the enemy is heading here as they increase their numbers. In that case, the longer the time we take till the confrontation, the more enemies will appear, and it will become more difficult to defeat them.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see. That\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Firey seemed to have been convinced by this and the talk advances.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, we will go at our fastest speed towards them, begin the battle with the monsters as fast as possible, and wipe them out\u2026\u2026. Sis Kyouka.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease join me in subjugating them. Let\u2019s not be stingy and settle this battle as soon as possible.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood! Decisive swift attacks are the specialty of the Ignis Militant corps! Let\u2019s remind the whole world the strength of our roaring flames!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a while since I have seen this part of her.</p><br/><p>The battlefield is where a hero truly burns. That\u2019s how I should be as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-oneesama!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are obviously going to accompany you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026All for one, one for all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Braidley, Glassfin, and Firey were breathing roughly, but I changed my view here and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will be staying here.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cEeeeeeh?!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>I mercilessly said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, Mirack-oneesama?! We are Onee-sama\u2019s personal guards!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we not strong enough to strengthen the sides of Onee-sama?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Lacking in strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>They clung onto me as if they were puppies about to be abandoned by their mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, don\u2019t get flustered. Properly use your brains.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time\u2019s monsters are a mystery and it kind of lets out an unpleasant atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, monsters popping out from nowhere is unheard of. Until that mystery has been solved, I can\u2019t say anything conclusive about how this battle will unfold.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why we should prepare for whatever happens and leave a part of our fighting force in our last line of defense. You people should also join that. And then, prepare for any sudden events and get an understanding of the mystery from a point where you can view the whole battlefield.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Understood!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the very least, they are an understanding bunch.</p><br/><p>Right now time is of essence, so it helps that they are obedient.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please report our plans to Founder-sama through the wireless transmission, and after that, give an urgent message to the other Churches as well, tell them our situation, and if possible, request for reinforcements. But I will leave the decision to Founder-sama.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>The three girls give out an energetic response.</p><br/><p>With this, everything that had to be spoken has been done.</p><br/><p>Now all that\u2019s left is to assault the enemy lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what are you taking your time for. Let\u2019s go, Mirack!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Looks like Sis Kyouka is plenty spirited.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for reinforcements. By the time the light and water people get here, let\u2019s welcome them with a plain filled with the corpses of monsters! With that, we will show them the strength of the Fire Church!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>When monsters die, they don\u2019t leave corpses though.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it looks like Sis Kyouka still has her fangs, and as her junior, that\u2019s reassuring.</p><br/><p>Now then, with the joint assault of the current and previous heroes, let\u2019s wipe out the monsters as always!!</p><ul><li>262: It means death</li></ul><br/><p>And so, leaving a number of fire militants and choosing only the quick-footed ones, we lead the charge\u2026by running.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrompt decision and quick to carry out. What are you aiming for with this speed-centered formation, Mirack?\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka was running parallel to me without losing breath.</p><br/><p>She will definitely be the most reliable fighting force in this battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe monsters are increasing their numbers on their own\u2026that\u2019s the part of the report that I am bothered by. There hasn\u2019t been an abnormality like that before.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Until Haine revealed the existence of the Mother Monsters, it had been a world mystery where the monsters came from. And yet, that mystery was occurring as they approach us.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut according to the information that the Churches share, those so called Mother Monsters don\u2019t exist anymore, right?\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe conclusion reached is that we should think of it in that way.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Raphael was the first Demon Lord humanity encountered, and it was born in exchange of the life of the Wind Mother Monster. And that was properly witnessed by Haine, Karen, and the others.</p><br/><p>If the Demon Lords can\u2019t be born without the sacrifice of their Mother Monsters, in this current state where the Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind Demon Lords are all lined up, it would be weird for the Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind Mother Monsters to not be wiped out because of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026it means that if we push through here, there won\u2019t be anymore monsters!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>If that were really the case, the human side would be cheering.</p><br/><p>Even if the Demon Lords are powerful, they can\u2019t maintain the life of a race by themselves. Monsters will end up being a race that will go extinct.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think that things will be going so smoothly.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue. The monsters have surely found a new way to reproduce!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>If that wasn\u2019t the case, there\u2019s no way they would challenge humanity for the superiority of race.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that means the answer might be in our destination huh!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cMight be, but right now\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>It is now in view!</p><br/><p>Fire element monsters that were covering the wide plains.</p><br/><p>Horse type, goat type, bird type, wolf type, monkey type monsters, and there are also types that had combinations of those.</p><br/><p>The trait of Fire element monsters is that they have the shape of birds or mammals, and their hair flickers like fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are getting the first strike! Let\u2019s go, Mirack!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka and I sprint without losing speed and charge towards the horde of monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire fist, Barbarossa!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight fire fist, Fernando! Left fire fist, Pelarius!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>The current and previous heroes prepare with their fire divine weapons. And from there, it was released at the same time\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c[Flame Burst]!!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Giant fire dragons quickly engulfed the fire monsters.</p><br/><p>The monsters were unable to endure the fire we released and turned into ashes inside of it.</p><br/><p>We are fire element and our opponents are fire element too; against the same element, the one with the strongest energy wins.</p><br/><p>Even so, the numbers are at the very least 500.</p><br/><p>Obviously a single round of Flame Bursts wasn\u2019t enough. There were many remaining.</p><br/><p>We simply sparked the flames of battle.</p><br/><p>Only a small part of the enemy lines was burned down, and the fire militants rush to the opened line of the enemy that was created.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Heat Knuckle]!\u201d \u201c[Heat Knuckle]!\u201d \u201c[Heat Knuckle]!\u201d \u201c[Heat Knuckle]!\u201d \u201c[Heat Knuckle]!\u201d \u201c[Heat Knuckle]!\u201d \u201c[Heat Knuckle]!\u201d \u201c[Heat Knuckle]!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shouts of techniques reverberate in the area.</p><br/><p>The battle has begun.</p><br/><p>A jumbled scuffle between humans and monsters was taking place.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack! This is\u2026!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka and I spearhead deep into the enemy lines while protecting each other\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>We heroes are basically the core of the army. We have to lead as much as possible and create chaos in the horde of enemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, every single one of them is a fire element monster! To think that there would be an organized horde of the same element! What\u2019s with this family tour?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember opening a sale with preferential treatment for monsters of my same element!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>We were burning down all the goats and wolves that came attacking us.</p><br/><p>In the end, they are small fry monsters.</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka has fought thousands of them and has never lost to the likes of them, and I have experience fighting giant monsters and Mother Monsters, so I don\u2019t feel like I could lose to enemies like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, right now we have to concentrate on wiping out the enemy! Let\u2019s spearhead as we are now and separate the enemy, and then make an U turn just like that and continue to separate the horde even more!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy doing that, the separated monsters can be easily defeated by the fire militants, right?! Understood!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>As expected of a veteran like Sis Kyouka. She is accustomed to armies of monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones that want to be burned, come at us! The fire heroes are here!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Sis!</p><br/><p>Right now, I should be the one saying that though!</p><br/><p>The moment I thought about quickly wrapping this up and was advancing more and more\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUoo?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was suddenly hit by something and was sent flying together with Sis Kyouka.</p><br/><p>It felt as if I had hit a hot wall.</p><br/><p>What was that? What did we impact on?!</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch\u2026 What in the world? Uwa?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mirack? Did you see anything weird\u2026wa?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka and I looked in front and stiffened.</p><br/><p>Spacing out in the battlefield is something that you shouldn\u2019t do for any reason, but even the battle-hardened Sis Kyouka had made that beginner mistake.</p><br/><p>Looking at the one in front of us, no matter what strong expert it is, they would tremble.</p><br/><p>A man big like a mountain. We had collided with him and Sis Kyouka and I were send flying.</p><br/><p>It is true that we both are women and we are physically lighter, but even if that\u2019s the case, we are heroes that have been trained, and our rushing strength is not on the level of a normal person, and yet, he repelled both of us at the same time.</p><br/><p>A big body that no matter if you describe it as a mountain or a wall, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to describe it.</p><br/><p>From his back there were two burning fire wings spread out.</p><br/><p>I know this man. I have seen him once, so I know.</p><br/><p>Just remembering it makes fear well up inside of me; the strongest and worst enemy \u2014a Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you two are the strongest within this bunch of humans. Well then, let\u2019s decide the fate of this battle as the strongest ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>From within the group of Demon Lords, he is the fire Demon Lord that\u2019s considered to be the leader, Michael.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put at stake the fate of our race that we both shoulder.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Meeting him meant death.</p><ul><li>263: Red hot death</li></ul><br/><p>Fire Demon Lord, Michael.</p><br/><p>One of the evils that threaten this world and their leader.</p><br/><p>That guy is standing right in front of us!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026Aaah\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Again\u2026it is that pressure.</p><br/><p>That coercive power that all Demon Lords possess. Just by being there, he kills the air around. A heavy and burning feeling.</p><br/><p>When we encountered them last time, that pressure had pressed onto my back, and everyone counting me couldn\u2019t move or even breathe.</p><br/><p>It was the same now; I couldn\u2019t endure a few seconds of it and had my knees fall to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgh\u2026Kugh\u2026! Aaah\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Even my lips had grown numb and my voice couldn\u2019t come out.</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka was in the same state and, as if concentrating on not being crushed, she placed both of her hands on the ground and it took her all to just place strength into them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026Damn it!!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>The opponent has not done anything, he is simply glaring at us, and yet, we were already pushed to the brink of defeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at your state, it seems you are not even in the shape to fight. So you people don\u2019t even have the right to fight me huh.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael looked at us as if we were trash and it was as if he had lost interest.</p><br/><p>And then, the tragedy begins.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuaaagh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGyaaaa!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka and I weren\u2019t the only ones who had been hit by the pressure of the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>That coerciveness, as long as you are in a certain range of it, no matter how many people it is, it can crush you.</p><br/><p>Ironically, the fire militants that had begun to catch up to us entered the effective range of the Demon Lord\u2019s pressure and were instantly crushed.</p><br/><p>Without his permission, no matter who it is, the moment you enter his domain, you can\u2019t even move. But the despairing part came after.</p><br/><p>In his domain, only the ones that have permission can move. In other words, his subordinates that are the fire element monsters can still move.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, I now understand why this horde is filled with fire element monsters. The Fire Demon Lord is the one leading them after all.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t the time to think about that\u2026</p><br/><p>We can\u2019t move and the enemy can do so freely.</p><br/><p>The meaning of that is\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cGuaaaagh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh?! Aaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one-sided slaughter of the fire militants had begun.</p><br/><p>The fire goats and fire wolves jumped onto the fire militants as if they were hungering hyenas and dug their burning fangs into their flesh.</p><br/><p>Screams began to reverberate in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>It was as if those screams were telling the only one currently standing on two feet here, the Demon Lord Michael, about its effectiveness.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo good\u2026! This is not good!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>If this continues, after a few minutes we will be wiped out.</p><br/><p>We have to do something!</p><br/><p>I am the hero! The fire hero that protects Muspelheim!</p><br/><p>That pride is the last bit of energy that fuels my strength.</p><br/><p>Hitting my bend knees continuously, I bring back my strength. I somehow managed to stand while trembling, and turn my head to the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire fist Barbarossa! Change my will into hell fire!! [Flame Burst]!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Flames spread through the ground as if swimming through it, and the monsters that were trotting on the ground with the intent to jump onto the fire militants and cleanly burns them down with pinpoint accuracy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe monsters have been burned down! I am alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-As expected of Mirack-sama! Our hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fire militants are okay!</p><br/><p>Of course, there\u2019s no way all the monsters have been burned down by it, but it looks like we have secured temporary safety.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people!! Use this chance to get out of the Demon Lord\u2019s range of pressure! Crawl if you have to! At any rate, just get away from the Demon Lord!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>We had approached the Demon Lord until we ended up right in front of him without noticing.</p><br/><p>It means that the pressure domain of the Demon Lord is not that far. If we get away from his territory, we can regain the freedom of our body!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you pushed back the pressure huh. Looks like you have the right to be my opponent.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>I turned at that voice.</p><br/><p>I ended up turning.</p><br/><p>That huge body was already standing at a place that covered my whole vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>In order to save the fire militants, I couldn\u2019t pay attention to the most dangerous opponent.</p><br/><p>Crap.</p><br/><p>By looking right at his eyes, an even stronger pressure began to attack me, and my limbs had completely stiffened.</p><br/><p>But the enemy didn\u2019t care about that.</p><br/><p>After clearly confirming that I was facing him, he swings down his fist.</p><br/><p>A big fist like a hammer was approaching me at close range, and because it was taking up my vision, it felt bigger than an actual hammer.</p><br/><p>I am going to be crushed by this fist.</p><br/><p>I will definitely die if I get hit.</p><br/><p>In an instant, many things ran through my mind, but my body didn\u2019t react at all. I couldn\u2019t move a single finger to defend.</p><br/><p>The fire hero died with a single attack of the Fire Demon Lord; that future was about to come when\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was pushed to the side and was send flying.</p><br/><p>When I turned my eyes to see what it was, it was Sis Kyouka.</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka had pushed me from the side.</p><br/><p>In exchange, Sis Kyouka was in the place where I was and\u2026the fist of the Demon Lord that was coming down was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSis Kyoukaaaaaaa!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Sis Kyouka was crushed by the fist of the Demon Lord in my place.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a metaphor, but a reality.</p><br/><p>Along with the sound of flesh being smashed and bones breaking, a spray of blood similar to fire colored my vision.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord pulled back his fist and looked at the result of his own action.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there was another one who could have been my opponent huh. That\u2019s a thing of the past now though.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cSis Kyouka! SIS KYOUKA!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I was unable to even pay attention to the Demon Lord in front of me and ran to the fallen Sis Kyouka.</p><br/><p>She was covered in blood and all her limbs were facing irregular directions.

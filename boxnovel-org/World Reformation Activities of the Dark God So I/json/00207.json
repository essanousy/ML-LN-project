Even when I am only looking at the photo, I could feel that mushy body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the monster that\u2019s currently heading here.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva says.</p><br/><p>He is the person that holds the highest of responsibilities in the safety of the city we are currently in.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get deceived by the peaceful-like appearance of it. It is hard to tell from the photo, but this thing is crazy big. It may not be as big as a Mother Monster, but it is comparable to the data of the Fire Cow and Great Sea Dragon we have.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning that it is super-sized class?!\u201d</p><br/><p>This round steam bun?</p><br/><p>It has a completely soothing appearance that just doesn\u2019t give me a sense of danger at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it is an opponent that\u2019s a lot more dangerous than its appearance lets out to be. Look here.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva points at another photo. In there, there\u2019s the same water steam bun monster, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLook closely below its feet!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>You say below its feet, but there\u2019s no feet\u2026</p><br/><p>Hm? What\u2019s that?!</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if this thing actually has a liquid body, but at any rate, its semi-transparent body had trees assimilated inside it, and they were dissolving!</p><br/><p>The camera had clearly caught the objects that had been engulfed and were being melted into nothingness.</p><br/><p>\u201c?! Scary-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf such a thing were to enter the city, it would turn terrible. Moreover, the worst thing is that this monster is heading straight here. There\u2019s no doubt that its objective is here!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Monsters heading to human settlements to attack them is a thing that happens often, but it is coming from quite the faraway place.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we are at the giant moving city, right? Can\u2019t we run away from it?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are already doing that, but this water steam bun is chasing after us even with that. Right now, we are in a state where we are moving, but we can\u2019t separate from it. To tell you the truth\u2026 this place doesn\u2019t have that much mobility. Places like mountains and palacides, there\u2019s a lot of locations that it can\u2019t move to due to the terrain, and the time it can move continuously isn\u2019t that long either. Once it moves for a certain amount, there\u2019s the need to recharge and give it maintenance.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning that we won\u2019t be able to escape for long.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are planning on doing many improvements to it, but at present, there\u2019s no other way for this city to survive but to defeat that thing!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva hits the photo of the monster with his fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs of now, this monster will be named Slime, and the Wind Church will do its all to subjugate it!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Aniue-sama.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>His sister Hyue who was at his side answers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be giving you full command of the Slime subjugation, wind hero! Lead the Kazama Shinobis and intercept it at once!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cOi~~~~!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva immediately acts like a fool.</p><br/><p>Well, he was suddenly answered by the hero in a way that\u2019s not fitting of a hero after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo Hyue, what are you saying?! You are already the wind hero!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cAniue-sama, I understand that this is an emergency, but we were also right in the middle of a fight with our existence and pride in line.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Is she talking about the past and new heroes match?</p><br/><p>But that had reached a conclusion with the victory of Sasae-chan, right?</p><br/><p>Due to the appearance of the monster, the victory has been postponed though.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you see, Hyue, with this problem that entails the whole city, it would be better to concentrate on this matter!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Also, I already announced \u2018it is the victory of the current heroes!\u2019 before the monster came, so it has already been settled. I won\u2019t let them make it unsettled like the time with the team match!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Shiva and I were admonishing her, but for some reason, Hyue was stubborn.</p><br/><p>\u201cAniue-sama, Haine-dono; it is true that we have won the match. I do think that that fact cannot be warped and negated by anyone, however\u2026!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cMy personal battle is different! I still haven\u2019t fought that one!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>There was a ghost at the place where Hyue points at.</p><br/><p>Woah.</p><br/><p>No matter how many times I see her, she still makes my spine shiver.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a ghost, but the proxy wind hero, Brastor Juo.</p><br/><p>She was here too?!</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-dono, Celestis-dono, and Sasae-dono got three straight wins, so my turn didn\u2019t come, but I had the resolution of finishing things with her today! Aniue-sama, please give the permission to square against her!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva denies her fervent request.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long! 5 seconds! 5 seconds is fine! In 5 seconds, I will shoot her right between her eyebrows, and after that, I will show you that I can slaughter a hundred \u2013no, two hundred monsters!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Why is Hyue-san getting so bloodthirsty?</p><br/><p>Even though she is normally one of the most composed ones within the heroes.</p><br/><p>Moreover, for a while now, Juo has been watching that state of hers and laughing \u2018kusukusu\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Interesting. In that case, I will make you into a beehive in one second.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you are on!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Picking fights back and forth!</p><br/><p>They are both at the neck of each other!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Good grief. These two are like this since long ago.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that sage look you have?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>While looking at the two that are scattering sparks as they glare at each other, Shiva lets out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Toreido household and Juo\u2019s Brastor household are prominent families of the Wind Church. Due to that connection, we have been acquainted since we were children.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the two didn\u2019t get along since long ago. Every time they saw each other, they would end up fighting. Do you know how much pain I have passed being a mediator? When they grew up, Juo became a scientist and Hyue joined the Kazama Shinobis. However, this created a sense of territory in their jobs, so their relationship got progressively worse.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cAniue-sama, that\u2019s because\u2026!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>While in the quarrel that had already escalated into a fist fight, Hyue raises her voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is this woman\u2019s fault. Even though she is a scientist, she postulated for hero, and actually became one! Who knows how much it hurt the pride of the Kazama Shinobis who are the military force of this nation! And yet, this woman, the moment she became a hero, she shut herself in her laboratory! She didn\u2019t do her job as a hero at all!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hah\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe higher-ups of the Church all settled in the decision of \u2018discharging her\u2019, and yet, only Aniue-sama protected her! Isn\u2019t it the fault of this woman that Aniue-sama had to temporarily take the post of Founder and hero?! Saying that once she returns to society, you would be able to give that title back to her anytime!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026but\u2026but\u2026!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Juo raised her voice as if cursing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shiva-sama abandoned me and made a person like this the hero\u2026!!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! You should have been abandoned a lot sooner!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The fight implodes.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Shiva once again lets out a big sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cJuo.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes?!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Shiva places a hand on her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, there were times when I didn\u2019t understand what you were thinking. You surprised me when you said \u2018I will become the hero\u2019 when I was appointed as the Founder, and when you became one, you shut yourself in and abandoned your professional duties.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s because\u2026\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I was against it. It is true that you are a genius and are good at both researching and fighting. You most definitely had the fighting ability to be a hero. But your personality wasn\u2019t fit for being a hero. You are scared of being in public, right?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cUuh\u2026\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Juo looked up depressed.</p><br/><p>She still had that ghost look of hers, but it was kind of cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven with that, I took on the role of hero so that you could return to that position whenever you wanted. But because of the previous incident, I couldn\u2019t afford to do that anymore. So I decided on passing on the title of hero to Hyue. But it was by no means something I did because I had no choice.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cAniue-sama!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Being spoken about, I felt like I heard Hyue\u2019s heart skip a beat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue had grown plenty enough as a wind gun user to leave the job of hero to her. In regards to the coordination with the other heroes as well, she possesses the most valuable trait that the heroes require from now on. Juo, this is something that you are the most bad at dealing with.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cUuhh\u2026!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t remember ever abandoning you. It is true that it was my bad for passing on the hero position without talking to you about it, but I do think that I need your help in the future, and the people of Rudras Metropolis as well.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiva-sama!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it you who created practically all the foundations regarding the moving city! Your will for research and those novel ideas of yours, they will be necessary for us now and in the future. That\u2019s why, please stay by my side and help us out. The title of hero doesn\u2019t matter!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiva-sama\u2026! I love you\u2026!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Did you say something?\u201d (Shiva) &lt;Hahahahahahaha!&gt;</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is nothing.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>My god.</p><br/><p>Could this be\u2026&lt;the legendary \u2018Eh? Nandatte?\u2019&gt;</p><br/><p>Juo had told me something in person between the match. \u2018There\u2019s something I can\u2019t give up on\u2019, \u2018I will have Shiva resign from his Founder position\u2019. She said that because she had feelings for him as a childhood friend and wanted to be together with him forever?</p><br/><p>She thought that she had been abandoned after Hyue had become a hero, and using this, Ates or someone in that faction fanned her on to participate in this.</p><br/><p>And there\u2019s no way Hyue, who shows signs of being a bro-con, would see this in a good wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter has been wrapped up then. Hyue, I will be counting on you on the hero job.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cAniue-sama, move away. I can\u2019t shoot her to death with you in the way.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>I feel like I understand now. The reason for the confrontation between the new and old wind heroes.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, I told Shiva this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should just explode.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was suddenly insulted?!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>The Wind Founder is someone you just want to insult.</p><br/><p>And Yorishiro who was actually here from the very beginning and was watching over this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a development that makes me want to puke-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>She was angered by Shiva\u2019s dense headed attitude.</p><br/><p>Shiva was bewildered by the atmosphere of irritation coming from his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with everyone?! Did I do something wrong?! \u2014Wait, ouch! Something hit me on my back! What\u2019s with this cow?! Why did it suddenly tackle me?! What\u2019s with that threatening pose?! Don\u2019t go doing preparations to tackle me again!!\u201d (Shiva)</p><ul><li>208: The stage of heroes</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cPlease let us fight as well.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The heroes of other churches were all inside the same meeting room as well, and Karen-san was representing them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dangers of this world already have no distinction between churches. If they are in that place and have the strength to fight, we have to face the enemy together.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The head Shiva looks at the surroundings after that proposal. Earth, Water, Fire, and Light; all the other Founders nodded together.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I will be counting on you. As the Wind Founder, we are deeply grateful for the gracious deeds of you heroes.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>But\u2026I was so worried. I couldn\u2019t just not ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay, Karen-san? What about your injuries in that explosion\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is okay! The burns have all been healed by Celestis-chan, and after the examination of the Wind Church, they told me that my insides are fine!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san pumps her fists to appeal her energy, but even with that, I was worried.</p><br/><p>Karen-san is the type that would a hundred percent act strong in the cases when she is not okay.</p><br/><p>Not only Karen-san; Mirack, Celestis, and Sasae-chan should still be fatigued by their matches.</p><br/><p>The only one in the current heroes alliance that I can say is in perfect condition is Hyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, I will be the one to!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>In this occasion, I didn\u2019t do much and still have plenty surplus of energy anyways.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need for Karen-san and the others that are injured to face danger. I can erase that thing in an instant with my dark matter and\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWait there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Light and Earth Founders grabbed my shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, I understand your feelings of caring for the well-being of the girls, but please spectate for a bit more.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis be the chance to push-sa ne. The biggest objective of the Hero Alliance be to have the heroes cooperate and face the monsters. We will be having \u2018em witness this in the flesh.\u201d (Oba-san)</p><br/><p>Right now in this Rudras Metropolis, there\u2019s many people from the five nations who came here to spectate the new and old heroes match.</p><br/><p>If five heroes were to cooperate and defeat the monsters and this were to be witnessed by those people, this will increase the authenticity of the Hero Alliance and the Contra-Reconciliation side won\u2019t even be able to breathe.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust give it a break already.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I had to speak out strictly.</p><br/><p>Just how much have Karen-san and the others pushed themselves today. They have endured underhanded tricks and strong enemies, and they are already injured all over.</p><br/><p>It was all in order to push the political fight to the best of conditions for Yorishiro and the others.</p><br/><p>But to make those girls fight even more for those same reasons, that would be pushing all of the burden onto them.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san and the others have fought plenty enough! I will deal with the rest!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It was in the moment when I was about to leave the meeting room in anger, the girls stopped me who was plenty ready to head to battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary consideration, Haine. We are still in perfect form.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor this full day, this place is our stage. Refusing an encore would be a disgrace as an idol.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving something to cut be happiness-dasu! As an earth hero, anything that can be cut will be cut-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Mirack, Celestis, Sasae-chan\u2026</p><br/><p>The three of them have by no means easily won the fights against the previous heroes that were their seniors.</p><br/><p>Rather, they won with their bodies filled with injuries, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-dono, we want to test ourselves. Just how far we can go with our combined strengths.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue joins the row with her wind gun in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe all know that Haine-san is the strongest. But please, watch over us just for a bit more. I want everyone to see that the five of us together are also the strongest.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I am by no means the strongest.</p><br/><p>I am this weak against the straightforward light in the eyes of these girls after all.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u2026And then, just a bit after, we five were standing at the wasteland.</p><br/><p>I -Kourin Karen- and my companions, totalling a number of five.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, I will ask just in case but, are your bodies okay? There\u2019s no need to push yourselves, you know?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I would like to ask you, Karen. Is there really no problem with the damage you received from the explosion?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you, Mirack-chi? You were cooked by your Senpai, weren\u2019t you. Even now, I can still smell a slightly tasty scent, you know?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-neechan, it looked like ya won easily, but the exhaustion of divine power wasn\u2019t anything ta sneeze at-dasu. The previous water hero be also a strong opponent-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-dono as well. The bandages around your body make you look like a mummy. As I thought, the unwounded me should hit that monster with the resentment I couldn\u2019t hit Juo with!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>In the end, it means that we all are wounded.</p><br/><p>But it is mysterious. Our condition is at the worst, and yet, I don\u2019t feel like we will lose with all five of us here.</p><br/><p>A half-transparent round mountain was approaching us from the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cO~h O~h, it is getting closer, it is getting closer, the Slime-chan. Just like the information stated, the trees and stones that it swallowed have been melted in an instant. Looks like the moment you get caught, there\u2019s only death awaiting.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it is the basic to take distance and attack from afar. But before that\u2026\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201c[Holy Light Sword]!\u201d \u201cFly, [Flame Knuckle]!\u201d \u201c[Water Rage]!\u201d \u201c[Transmute] a rock around here and\u2026[All In, One Shot]-dasu!\u201d \u201cWind long gun technique, [Bell Bang]!\u201d</p><br/><p>From each divine tool, different elements were shot at long-distance.</p><br/><p>Those hit directly at the surface of the slime\u2026but the problem comes from now on.</p><br/><p>My \u2018Holy Light Blade\u2019 cut through the surface of the slime and did some damage to it as it dissipated, but it soon regenerated and there was no wound remaining.</p><br/><p>Leaving that aside for now, the fire of Mirack-chan and the earth attack of Sasae-chan opened a hole in the semi-liquid body and soon regenerated, but\u2026Celestis-chan\u2019s water bullet hit the surface and didn\u2019t leave a single wound behind. On the other hand, the wind bullet of Hyue-chan was the one that worked the most. It opened the deepest hole within the attacks of us five.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt resisted the water attack and is weak against the wind element?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, it is earth element?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The slime is an earth element monster?</p><br/><p>But wait. From what I heard, the earth element monsters should have only been the Golems that were born from Grandma Wood. Moreover, Grandma Wood -the Mother Monster that is their very source- is gone and shouldn\u2019t be born anymore!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mystery solving sounds fun, but we should leave that for later.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. At our back, there\u2019s the Wind capital Rudras Metropolis and the millions of people living there.</p><br/><p>As a moving city, they can run away from the slime, but they have stopped that now and are a few ways back from us in standby.</p><br/><p>In order to watch over our battle.</p><br/><p>Everyone is believing that us heroes will definitely win.</p><br/><p>That expectation, that trust; in order to not betray it, we will defeat that giant jelly!</p><br/><p>\u201cI had the Kazama Shinobis do the protection of the city. It is a true to the word fight between us five and that water steamed bun.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what I wanted. That is exactly the stage where the heroes shine!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The fight begins.</p><br/><p>A flashy fight that will serve as the decoration to end this battle.</p><ul><li>209: Persecution</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cSo, how are we going to defeat that giant steam bun? I think you already know, but we cannot make it into tea and drink it, you know!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is that big after all. In the test shots before, there was a difference in effectivity, but in the end, the opened holes have all closed.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>That transparent liquid body, even if we were to injure it, the body begins to regenerate soon after and return to its previous state.</p><br/><p>Even so, if we were to do a big attack that blows away a huge part of its body, it might be possible to inflict fatal damage, but every time we fight, they are always in that level of size. In terms of raw strength, we wouldn\u2019t be able to win at all.</p><br/><p>Even if it is with the wind element that is advantageous against it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, even when it is that water-looking, it is earth element. How to I say it, it is like unexpected\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is no time to be leisurely observing. That Slime might be slow, but it is steadily heading towards Rudras Metropolis. We have to defeat it somehow before it arrives here!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>It is just as Mirack-chan says.</p><br/><p>And in order to defeat the Slime, we can\u2019t just push with brute strength. We have to use wits as well.</p><br/><p>What do we do\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey everyone. Doesn\u2019t that Slime resemble a Golem?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d \u201cEh?\u201d \u201cDasu?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The approaching speed of the Slime is slow.</p><br/><p>We still had the leeway to continue our planning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Karen-chi? That rough Golem and this round water Slime, there\u2019s no similarities at all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat be right, Karen-neechan! Just because they be the same earth element, ya grouping \u2018em up be way too far fetched-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>It was a storm of complains from everyone but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, as I thought, they really do resemble each other. The part about them regenerating as soon as their body is damaged!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The Slime we are fighting now would pour its liquid body to the damaged area and it would soon fix itself; the Golems would use the stones and earth of its surroundings to make their body again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of them use two different things to fix up their body. That regenerating trait they have, I don\u2019t know if it is because they are both earth element monsters, but it is incredibly similar!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat may be true, but what are you trying to get at with this?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan has asked a good question, so I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, don\u2019t you think there\u2019s other things that are similar? Golems will regenerate as many times as they want as long as the Life Block that serves as its core is okay. In that case, maybe the Slime as well\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cAh.\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Looks like everyone has understood now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Slime might have a core as well, is what you are trying to say huh! I see. If that were to be destroyed, it would be leaps and bounds more efficient than just blowing it up without leaving any trace of it!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how are we going to find the core inside such a big thing like that? Do we jump inside it and swim until we find it? We would be melted to the bones before we find it, you know?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>What Celestis-chan says is correct.</p><br/><p>But I also had an idea regarding that.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, hear me out.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The plan meeting has finished.</p><br/><p>Now all that\u2019s left is to move to action.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this, everyone!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cHindrance team, move out!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Dividing the team in two, Mirack-chan, Sasae-chan, and Celestis-chan run towards the Slime.</p><br/><p>Paying plenty enough attention to their surroundings as they approach, they stop at a place where they can still maintain their safety.</p><br/><p>\u201cAround here should be fine. Let\u2019s do this, Sasae!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it-dasu! [Magma Ocean]-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The fire of Mirack-chan and the earth of Sasae-chan cooperate to create the combined element \u2018Magma\u2019.</p><br/><p>The ground in front of them became redder, and becomes accumulated lava.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a lava moat! It is crazy hot. If you can move through it, try it!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, the Slime should stop moving its feet-dasu! That water steam bun ain\u2019t got any feet though, it just be a metaphor-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>What I asked of Mirack-chan and the others was to hold the Slime back.</p><br/><p>While its movements have stopped by the lava moat, we continue our sure-kill plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did it! It is going smoothly! Everyone, do your best!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>And Celestis-chan who is at the back of Mirack-chan and Sasae-chan providing support.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-nechan, ya be an extra-dasu! Putting it bluntly, there be no point in ya being here-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt truly is painful to get an enemy that your element can\u2019t handle, right? I am truly glad I am not a water element that would make me spectate because it doesn\u2019t work on the Slime~~!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Leaving the defense to those three, Hyue-chan and I aim for the offensive.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue-chan, I am counting on you.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Wind Gun Technique, [Echo]!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan snipes the Slime at a slightly faraway location. However, what\u2019s being shot is not the usual wind bullet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the Wind Gun, En no Ozuno, is shooting is an ultrasound bullet that surpasses the hearing capabilities of a human. This resonates inside the Slime\u2019s insides, and the echo that returns from it is caught by my ears.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>When I was hurt in the new and past heroes match, the proxy wind hero Juo-san utilized the ultrasound diagnosis device.</p><br/><p>By pouring a special sound into the body of a human, you pick up the echoes of it to make it possible to confirm the state of the insides without cutting open the body. A mysterious machine.</p><br/><p>I thought that maybe we could find the core of the slime with that same principle.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Karen-dono really does impress me. To think that you would immediately put to practical use something that happened just today.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also didn\u2019t think I would be utilizing it.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It really is useful to experience all you can.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a problem.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe structure of the Slime is a lot more simple than that of a human, so it is possible to locate the core without the use of a machine. But it is still that size. It is impossible to cover its whole body with ultrasound with just one shot.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what should we do?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no choice but to shoot several shots at different locations to cover the whole body as we search. It would take time though.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>It is okay.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the reason why I have brought my usual flying machine and have Hyue-chan riding behind me.</p><br/><p>In the time Mirack-chan and the others are holding it back, we will fly all around the Slime and shoot it all up!</p><br/><p>But just as I was thinking that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren! Karen, this is terrible!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan calls out to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat water steam bun ain\u2019t fazed at all from the lava-dasu! It be crossing it normally-dasu yo!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>No way!</p><br/><p>The lava moat that Mirack-chan and Sasae-chan made was crossed by the Slime as if it were a wasteland with nothing in it.</p><br/><p>It is not that it isn\u2019t working. The liquid that touches the lava is making *fsst* sounds as it boils, but it didn\u2019t look like the Slime was suffering at all.</p><br/><p>It is going straight at it without losing any speed at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, what are you doing?! You people are really useless.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be told that by you!\u201d \u201c-Dasu!\u201d</p><br/><p>This is not the time to get soothed by the retort of Celestis-chan!</p><br/><p>Can we even manage to locate the core by the time the Slime reaches Rudras Metropolis?!</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-205-206-vain-struggle\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 205-206 - Vain Struggle\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-210-211-reinforcements-arrive\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 210-211 - Reinforcements Arrive\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236331\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

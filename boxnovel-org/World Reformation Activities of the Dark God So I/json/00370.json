To think that the parts have moved on their own whim and you haven\u2019t been able to reach completion yet\u2026!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>I look up at the shining towering figure.</p><br/><p>Those useless Demon Lords were showing signs of returning, so I hurriedly changed locations.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, I have no choice but to forcefully activate Lucifer that I was thinking of having it sleep until it was perfected.</p><br/><p>How pitiful my child is.</p><br/><p>To think I would have to awaken you in such a crooked figure before reaching beautiful perfection.</p><br/><p>I am the half of the Light Goddess Inflation, as well as the human Sunnysol Ates.</p><br/><p>The Light Demon Lord Lucifer that I have created will be the first and only light element monster in the world.</p><br/><p>But I was planning on making it not only that, but a completely invincible and unique monster.</p><br/><p>Because of that, I sought everything.</p><br/><p>Lucifer had to have not only light but all of them.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I deceived the Demon Lords of each element and set them to fight the humans.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lords were supposed to have a fierce battle with the humans.</p><br/><p>With the sacrifice of several millions of humans, the Demon Lords would fall, and the residual four base element divine powers will lose their owner and float in the sky.</p><br/><p>I was planning on having Lucifer use that.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lords born from lower Gods like Nova, Coacervate, Mantle, and Quasar would at most serve as puzzle pieces to perfect my Lucifer.</p><br/><p>But the results of inferior Gods would obviously be inferior.</p><br/><p>They were all idiots that couldn\u2019t even properly move in the rails I had prepared.</p><br/><p>Raphael was the only one who died according to my plans, and yet, he couldn\u2019t even bring down a single human along with him. A pathetic death.</p><br/><p>Well, fine. It is a whole lot better than the other three idiots that couldn\u2019t even die.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord class wind divine power that separated from Raphael had safely arrived to Lucifer as planned and became part of it.</p><br/><p>Currently, there\u2019s now colorful butterfly wings at the back of Lucifer along with its light wings.</p><br/><p>A total of four wings.</p><br/><p>With this, there\u2019s four.</p><br/><p>Only four.</p><br/><p>Lucifer should have had twelve wings when it was completed.</p><br/><p>This is all the fault of Michael and those idiots for not dying.</p><br/><p>It would be one thing if they were way too weak to kill the humans, but to think they would reconcile and stop the fighting. On top of that, they didn\u2019t kill humans.</p><br/><p>Why is it that every single pawn of mine doesn\u2019t move as I want them to and are all braindead?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Now that it has come to this, there\u2019s no other choice.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>If they won\u2019t move as I want, I just have to move directly.</p><br/><p>Lucifer is currently incomplete, but it has plenty enough power after obtaining wind. It should still be able to easily crush those three even if they were to fight Lucifer together.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to hide its presence in case something happens.</p><br/><p>Idiots that don\u2019t have the will to fight are basically trash. I will have the Light Demon Lord dispose of that trash, and change them into wings that will decorate its back!</p><br/><p>\u201cLight Demon Lord, Lucifer; you are currently not the Great Demon Lord yet. When you obtain all the elements, all the powers, you will truly be the Great Demon Lord!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Sorry for waking you up before that.</p><br/><p>But it looks like, in order to reach the perfect strength, you will have to obtain it with your own hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow go, Lucifer. In order to become perfect, and with that perfected strength, destroy this unsightly world!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>The mountain moved.</p><br/><p>That itself is the figure of my creation, Lucifer.</p><br/><p>A big build that doesn\u2019t fall short to the Mother Monsters that the four Base Elements created.</p><br/><p>I provided a human-like upper half to this child, and a snake-like lower half.</p><br/><p>What will be destroying the humans, is the foolishness of the humans themselves.</p><br/><p>This design is a metaphor of this.</p><br/><p>The unsightly and disgusting snake lower half is the selfishness that lies deep inside all humans, and their cruelty given shape.</p><br/><p>At its back, there\u2019s only the shining light wings and the still new butterfly wings.</p><br/><p>Adding to that, there will be the fire wings, transparent wings, and the tree wings.</p><br/><p>And then, the last ones will be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Lucifer!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>This is the time to sound the trumpet of the end!!</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-367-369-once-something-has-already-been-broken%E2%80%A6\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 367-369 - Once something has already been broken\u2026\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-371-373-looking-back\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 371-373 - Looking back\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236394\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

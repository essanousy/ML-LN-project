It was on a level that I felt I was being completely crushed flat.</p><br/><p>Even in the middle of our duties at the Light Church, they would stick their bodies to me and whisper their love. For the body of a growing man, this was incredibly bad for my health.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can finally go, to our searching tour of the Dark Underworld Country!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think I would be able to have a journey with this lineup, it is like a honeymoon-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Is a honeymoon something that\u2019s supposed to be done with three people?</p><br/><p>When I am involved, these two become a pair that are just wishing to be retorted.</p><br/><p>Weird rumors have already been spreading inside the church, and sadly, most of them are true\u2026 And in order to have those rumors cool down, this journey might be useful to make them \u2018disappear\u2019 from there.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I tried thinking about it for a bit but, as I thought, it won\u2019t work. I can easily imagine that our absence will only invite speculation and the stories will get even more inflated.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, Karen-san, are the preparations on your side done?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Founder! Please look!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Saying this, what Karen-san pointed at with a *bang!* was the flying machine that I am already familiar with.</p><br/><p>It is a one-man ride that flies at high speeds powered with Ethereal energy, and thanks to this little one, the range of things the hero Karen-san can do have increased drastically.</p><br/><p>It is a great machine that\u2019s already on the level that it should be indispensable for a hero, but the one I am seeing today is a bit different from the one I am used to.</p><br/><p>\u201cI requested this from the manufacturers in the Flaptor company and had them remodel it in several areas. It has been painted with a special heat-resistant paint and closed up as many of the opened areas in the machine as possible to increase the airtight properties of it. It is in order to avoid sand from entering.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSand?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The destination this time seems like it will be a lot crueler than the places we have been until now, so we can\u2019t lack in preparations.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Yeah, our journey this time is to search for the Underworld country, but the place we are heading to search in has already been established.</p><br/><p>We have already poured light divine power to the \u2018Needle of Guidance\u2019 in order to have it point at our wished destination.</p><br/><p>And then, after matching the direction with the map, we inferred the location we would arrive at.</p><br/><p>A desert.</p><br/><p>Speaking of it in more detail, it is a big desert that is at the territory of the Earth capital, Ishtar Blaze. The people call it the \u2018Nameless Desert\u2019.</p><br/><p>It is all sand without a single blade of grass growing, and it is said that everyone that has gone in there has died. And in reality, there have been reports of several people always ending up stranded there. It is a pretty dangerous place.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, there\u2019s the need to be completely prepared.</p><br/><p>\u2026Well, in normal circumstances, it would be best to just not go there though.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it is exactly because it is such a dangerous place that people don\u2019t get close to it, and it wouldn\u2019t be strange if there were a city that people have not been able to discover there for several centuries. It might become the discovery of the century!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufu, it tingles your sense of adventure-desu wa ne.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Why are these two holy women so hyped up?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I am still worried. Having you girls go to such a dangerous place is just\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t look down on me, Haine-san. I am a hero. I have already learned the survival skills in order to fight against monsters in any kind of extreme situations.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>After Karen-san, Yorishiro also speaks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s needed when stepping into an unknown land is careful preparation. As long as there\u2019s that, there\u2019s no need to fear more than necessary. Believe that the wisdom of humans can conquer nature.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>And so says the God\u2026</p><br/><p>In your case, it only means that you can just release your power as a Goddess and things will resolve somehow.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s the same for me though.</p><br/><p>In that sense, there\u2019s most likely no need to worry?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s go, Yorishiro-sama!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Karen-san. Finally, what we have been waiting for!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOur journey of love with Haine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAn incognito trip where love and desire swirls!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>As I thought, maybe we should not go.</p><br/><p>I am beginning to wonder what\u2019s their actual objective.</p><ul><li>71: At the Oasis</li></ul><br/><p>From the places we have gone to, this \u2018Nameless Desert\u2019 is the one who is the most harshest of them all.</p><br/><p>It truly was sand from as far as you can see. There\u2019s nothing that serves as a landmark, so the sense of direction gets disarrayed, and the sand is reflecting the sunlight making it quite hot.</p><br/><p>It is exactly because of the flying machine that we were able to reach all the way here and allowed us to move fast even in a place like this, but if that wasn\u2019t the case, we would have it quite rough.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, Haine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san calls to me as she drives through the desert with her flying machine.</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama is in a dire state!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>There was one girl that was having it hard.</p><br/><p>When I look , the person that is clinging onto the back of Karen-san at the rear seat of the flying machine, Yorishiro, was having her life force shaved off by the heat and the sunlight\u2019s radiance.</p><br/><p>She had her tongue out and going *huff huff* like a summertime dog.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh good grief. It is because you are normally at the Grand Church and rarely go out, and now you have suddenly gone to a rough place like this\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>At this rate, the life force of Yorishiro will run out\u2026</p><br/><p>This is problematic. Even if we want to let her rest, there\u2019s only sand all around us with no place to take it easy.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yorishiro stayed silent with only her compass in hand. The needle was going in circles like crazy, and then, points at a set direction.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..Oasis.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looks like she doesn\u2019t have anymore strength to say anything more.</p><br/><p>What she has in her hands is the \u2018Needle of Guidance\u2019 that can point at the things you search for if you pour light divine power in it.</p><br/><p>This thing that we have been using in order to search for the Underworld country has now changed its target to an oasis. In other words, a water source inside the desert.</p><br/><p>What a crafty woman. And also, what a convenient item.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, let\u2019s head to the oasis. At this rate, Yorishiro-sama will dry up.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Having the Light Founder dying from heatstroke would not be funny.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>And so, Karen-san and I turn our flying machines to the oasis and drive our way there.</p><br/><p>By the way, there\u2019s currently two flying machines here; the one that Karen-san and Yorishiro are riding, and the one I am riding.</p><br/><p>In this journey, I managed to ride on my own personal flying machine!</p><br/><p>When we were about to depart for this journey, Yorishiro prepared this with her own pocket money.</p><br/><p>She nonchalantly said: \u2018I am giving this to you\u2019, but I refused.</p><br/><p>After all, when I was going to buy this flying machine myself, I learned that it was being sold at a terrifying price.</p><br/><p>Since I become the hero\u2019s assistant, I now have quite a decent wage, but I would have to throw a whole half a year worth of my pay in order to afford one.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the cheapest one.</p><br/><p>With less than half of that price, I would be able to buy a pretty decent house at Apollon City.</p><br/><p>I was thinking of sending part of my pay to my parents at the village, so it made the price even more shocking.</p><br/><p>Even if I am told nonchalantly by her that she would be \u2018giving\u2019 me the luxury I was unable to buy, I would be way too scared of what would happen after receiving it.</p><br/><p>And so, right now, I am riding this only as a borrowed article from the Light Church, and only using it on official business.</p><br/><p>I am suddenly already using it for private business, but if I think of it as using it to act as the bodyguard of the hero and the Founder, it can\u2019t be considered 100% private business! \u2026Probably.</p><br/><p>If the Underworld country really does exist, it would be a world shaking discovery, so thinking of it in that way, it can\u2019t be called private business! \u2026Probably.</p><br/><p>And in that way, as I was making excuses for myself, we found an area of green right in the middle of the desert.</p><br/><p>There really was an oasis here.</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p>Water welled up in the desert, and with that as a source, green grew thickly; an oasis, what a mysterious place.</p><br/><p>With the vaporization of the water and the shadows that the vegetation creates, this place is a lot more fresh.</p><br/><p>We took a break of around 1 hour there and Yorishiro finally regained her vitality.</p><br/><p>\u201cAah, I am back~~! The blessing of nature is the best~~!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>In the end, humans can\u2019t control nature.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the one that was saved was not only Yorishiro-sama. I was having it rough as well after all.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san says this as she wipes her face covered in sweat.</p><br/><p>True, that applies to me as well.</p><br/><p>We are tougher as fighters compared to Yorishiro, but that doesn\u2019t mean we are completely fine in a harsh environment.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s plenty chance that we would get heat stroke as well if we were to wander too long in the sunlight of the desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, it is way too reckless to move around the desert in the morning. Let\u2019s rest in this oasis and wait for night to come.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Is what I say and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the sun goes down and the temperature lowers, we will resume the search for the Underworld country, right? Then, there\u2019s something I would like to do now that we are here.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>What? Karen-san suddenly began fidgeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cBath.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that feeling.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro who was groggy jumped at that proposal.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is so hot and my whole body is covered in sweat, and even my underwear is soaking wet. On top of that, there\u2019s sand inside my clothes, and if I don\u2019t wash it, I will feel completely uncomfortable.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, there\u2019s an oasis here in good timing, and a spring\u2026But you see, if we are going to take a bath, we would need to take off our clothes, and get naked, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Hearing until that point, I understood what they wanted to say. It is true that they would be worried about the gaze of a man.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease peek, okay?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstoo\u2014eh?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I almost agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Karen-san. Isn\u2019t that the part where you say \u2018please don\u2019t peek\u2019?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn normal cases, yeah. But I love Haine-san. That\u2019s why, it would trouble me if you don\u2019t peek.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Since the time she confessed, her aggressiveness has been escalating!</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that feeling, Karen-san. They would think: \u2018is that gentleman seeing me as a woman?\u2019, this is a life-or-death problem for a lady. And that\u2019s how it is Haine-san, I will be taking a bath as well, so don\u2019t hesitate to peek.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will hesitate!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I am the human, Kuromiya Haine. And the boundary that separates humans from animals is reasoning. That\u2019s why, I value reason. No matter the time and place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you not going to peek no matter what?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I won\u2019t! There\u2019s a code of conduct even in intimate relationships after all!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I assert this.</p><br/><p>I hope that these two will give up with this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be helped-desu wa, Karen-san. Haine-san is not the cowardly type that would hide and peek on someone after all.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Yorishiro-sama. Haine-san is not the kind of coward who would hide and do things sneakily. In other words, we bath together unreservedly!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOooi!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Why is it getting deeper?!</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, Haine-san! I will wring out all of my courage to accompany you, so please!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that courage! Please use that courage to fight against monsters!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>When I tried to convince Karen-san, Yorishiro joins in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, the courage of a hero and the courage of a woman are two different things. And to prove that, see? My legs are shaking. But, in order to become the woman of Haine-san officially, I will win against my fear!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWin against your fear for the sake of guiding your believers!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Convincing these two utilized more energy than when we were wandering in the desert.</p><ul><li>72: Beautiful spring</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cAra, Karen-san, your skin is truly white. Moreover, it is so clear, it looks like polished white porcelain.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh come on, Yorishiro-sama, please don\u2019t look so intently at my naked body. Yorishiro-sama, you yourself have a pretty well-developed body and\u2026uhm\u2026it is incredibly big.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>They really went to take a bath.</p><br/><p>The sounds of water splashing and the laughs that were like the chirping of birds.</p><br/><p>All of those were entering my ears and stimulating the male part of Kuromiya Haine. And at the same time, the human part of Kuromiya Haine was cautioning: \u2018this is not the time yet, don\u2019t hurry things\u2019.</p><br/><p>A fierce struggle between reason and desire.</p><br/><p>Of course, this is what those girls were aiming for.</p><br/><p>\u201cEek! Yorishiro-sama, please don\u2019t poke at weird places!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine? My body and your body are the personal feast of Haine-san. Sampling each other\u2019s body will help in understanding what needs to be corrected-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Then, is it okay for me to poke Yorishiro-sama as well?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Go ahead and do it anywhere you want.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Aaaaaaahhh!!!</p><br/><p>That was the scream of my instincts.</p><br/><p>They are saying those things while knowing. Purposely having me hear it, they are aiming to destroy my sense of reason with their \u2018kya kya fufu\u2019.</p><br/><p>It is true that I said I won\u2019t peek, and I also said I won\u2019t bathe with them.</p><br/><p>If I disappear from their view, the doubts that I might be peeking wouldn\u2019t go away, so I went out of my way and turned my back at an area close to the spring and am currently sitting firmly there.</p><br/><p>Because I have my back turned I can\u2019t see, but I can clearly hear the sounds of the water and their lovely voices.</p><br/><p>They know. If they continuously make me hear those voices, they can crack my reason and I would turn into an animal.</p><br/><p>The tag team of these two is way too scary.</p><br/><p>Both of them are extreme in their behavior, but whether it is Karen-san or Yorishiro, when they are on their own, they are girls that have a bit more reservation than this.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also the eyes of the surroundings and they are intelligent girls to begin with, so they know that if they lose their sense of shame, it would be terrible.</p><br/><p>But the brake that they place when they are on their own suddenly gets destroyed when there\u2019s the two of them.</p><br/><p>When one takes one step, the other will go: \u2018ah, so it\u2019s okay to go that far\u2019, and does one step further than that. And then, the other side, seeing this, will go: \u2018ah, so it\u2019s okay to go that far\u2019, and it will be a repeat of that as they dig themselves into a deeper hole.</p><br/><p>By the time they notice, they are already at a far line that they shouldn\u2019t have crossed.</p><br/><p>Those are the kind of mistakes you end up regretting later.</p><br/><p>Karen-san and Yorishiro; the two are actually quite similar, and that\u2019s exactly why they are a dangerous type to mix together.</p><br/><p>Being in between these two, the three of us are alone at an oasis in the middle of the desert that\u2019s basically a deserted island.</p><br/><p>Encountering someone here is close to zero. Because of various reasons, I have been unable to move for almost half of the day.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with this impasse that had no opening? There\u2019s no escape!</p><br/><p>If this seduction continues until sunset, even I wouldn\u2019t be able to protect my steel resolve!</p><br/><p>What am I to do, Haine?!</p><br/><p>What should I do about the beast inside of me?!</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p>I managed to endure it.</p><br/><p>Because the two holy women had tired themselves out after finishing their bath.</p><br/><p>\u201cKu\u2026ku\u2026ku\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufu, she is sleeping soundly.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Karen-san is making sleeping sounds, and Yorishiro, who had placed Karen-san\u2019s head on her lap, was looking at her happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe must have gotten tired after frolicking too much. This morning, she had a face that said she hadn\u2019t slept at all because of her excitement. The pleasantness of the bath must have sooth her into sleep.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m saved~. That was close.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Thanks to Karen-san being asleep, the offensive has stopped.</p><br/><p>If it continued just like that, my reason would have definitely crumbled, and a situation that can\u2019t be shown to children would have happened.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Karen-san has truly become a lively girl. Since meeting with Haine-san, she has changed to a point that you wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize her.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Really?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Her core as a zealous person has not changed, but in her inauguration as a hero, that zealousness was showing openly. By meeting Haine-san, she has become able to play around quite a lot.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, sorry for being an evil man that corrupts the hero.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the contrary. The Karen-san before meeting you was, how to say it, overeager, or more like, stiffened up; at any rate, she didn\u2019t have any flexibility. Her intentions were good, but she was sacrificing herself for that sake. Haine-san, you were the one who allowed her to loosen that unnecessary strength.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that a good thing?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is. As an assistant of the hero, you are properly caring for the mental health of the hero. As a Founder, I praise you.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro dresses it up as a joke.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, the Karen-san I met at my village gave me an impression that her shoulders and elbows were more stuck to the front.</p><br/><p>I thought that was gone because she simply got more familiar with me, but I see, she was the one who changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a long time, I have thought I could be friends with her.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro continues looking at the sleeping face of Karen-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a long time, I have thought that she is similar to me. She fell in love with the same person as me, so my intuition was spot on. Thanks to that, we have completely become good friends. But\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san will\u2026definitely choose Karen-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro said something unexpected.</p><br/><p>In other words, that means Yorishiro is saying I will choose Karen-san as my girlfriend?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong so suddenly? Saying something that\u2019s not like you.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well\u2026you and I have a past after all. Even if we are inside human vessels now, you wouldn\u2019t marry a woman that sealed you before, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>In the battle of Gods 1,600 years ago, in the battle where I was the Dark God Entropy and Yorishiro was the Light Goddess Inflation, I was defeated by her, and was sealed for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you think I am holding a grudge on you?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how long do you think that has been? 1,600 years. That\u2019s way too far in the past. It is even hard to not forget the grudges I had just a day before. It would be way too tiring to hold a grudge that\u2019s more than 1 year old.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 the other ones\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why I beat up Nova and Coacervate was because those guys pissed me off in the present. If they are pieces of shit like in the past, even the grudges of the past would resurface, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>But Yorishiro is different.</p><br/><p>The Light Goddess Inflation in front of me is different.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, I am fond of the Light Goddess Inflation as an equal God. We are comrades that cooperated to create the world. There\u2019s no way I would hate you.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine\u2026 Haine-san!!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s only as the Dark God Entropy towards the Light Goddess Inflation. The human Haine towards Yorishiro\u2026that would have to start from zero first\u2014Uoo?!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I looked at my side and get surprised.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro is crying. Silently. But there\u2019s an amount of tears that was enough to create strings flowing from both of her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?! There\u2019s no need to cry, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san is at fault for saying something that would make me cry. I felt like the burden I had been shouldering for 1,600 years had fallen off.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>And so that\u2019s why she is crying tears of happiness.</p><br/><p>She has a lot more sweet parts than I thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s exactly why it is saddening. To the point that I would want to cry.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you learn about the evils I have done in the time you weren\u2019t there, you would definitely end up hating me.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-67-69-the-reason-of-their-encounter\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 67-69 - The reason of their encounter\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-73-75-underworld-down-slope\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 73-75 - Underworld down-slope\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236273\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

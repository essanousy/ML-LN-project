But don\u2019t let her escape at any cost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ates-sama is the previous hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already know! But right now she is a traitor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s capture her inside the Grand Church! Don\u2019t let this leak out to the outside!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The whole of the light knights were mobilizing in order to capture Ates-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201cHarden the security in all the exits! Don\u2019t let a single thing about this be leaked outside!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle with Ates-sama had begun at the Founder\u2019s office room.</p><br/><p>On top of that, since Ates-sama had escaped while she was in the middle of heading to the underground prison inside the Light Grand Church, the chase was still inside.</p><br/><p>We can\u2019t let the ruckus reach the outside, so the place was filled with the spirit of finishing all this inside the church.</p><br/><p>And now, Ates-sama stood before me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, is this the point of reunion? That was a delightful escort.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Even though she is already just a pitiful escapee, Ates-sama wasn\u2019t showing a single sign of being flustered.</p><br/><p>The cold gaze of Yorishiro-sama was directed at that Ates-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you really had noticed huh. Purposely creating a strange route for the chase of the light knights, we led you all the way here.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was sure a splendid treasure would be awaiting me here after all. And so, you will be making me fight, right? Against that goody two-shoes over there.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates-sama\u2019s gaze was directed at me who was standing at the side of Yorishiro-sama.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, this is the training field that the light knights use. The perfect place to rampage.</p><br/><p>Ates-sama must have already known that a fight would be waiting for her here.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the heroes match, I couldn\u2019t play with you after all. This is a good chance, so let\u2019s teach it to you; the strength of the true light hero.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for that.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Just like we previously agreed to, Yorishiro-sama steps forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is my duty as your sister to bring you down. Sunnysol Ates, the second generation of vice in the Sunnysol family, I will be cutting this with my own hands.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason you threw away the name of Sunnysol the moment you rose to the position of Founder was because of that, right\u2026\u2026 But, fufu, are you serious?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates-sama faced Yorishiro-sama and laughed as if making fun of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro, to think that you would actually challenge me in power. You who only has ability as a schemer, do you really think you can defeat me a person that has climbed up to being a hero?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is exactly because I think that way that I am standing here.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama does one more step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, Karen-san, please don\u2019t assist by any means.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Yorishiro-sama\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the insurance in case something happens. If I were to be defeated, please smite that smear. But well, that will not be happening though.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The gaze of Yorishiro-sama changed from me to Ates-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201cI placed a lot of burden on Karen-san at the heroes match after all. I have to break some bones here. Of course, I am talking about the bones in your whole body, Ates.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. Let\u2019s see if the little sister can beat her big sister.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>And then, Ates-sama takes a stance with her spear.</p><br/><p>That is the personal divine tool of Ates-sama, the light spear, Cain?!</p><br/><p>Why does she now have the weapon she didn\u2019t have when she was apprehended?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you go through the trouble of slipping past the guards in order to get that back? I didn\u2019t know a person could have such attachments to that.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I have lost my standing in the political world, the only thing that I can rely on now is my own strength.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates-sama spins her spear and sounds of stirred up wind were let out.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Yorishiro-sama doesn\u2019t even have a dagger. She was completely barehanded.</p><br/><p>No matter how good a person is at controlling divine power, it is impossible for normal humans to give shape to divine power.</p><br/><p>Without divine tools to resonate with divine power and amplify it, everyone is simply a human.</p><br/><p>That can be said to be an absolute rule in the five Grand Churches\u2026or at least, that\u2019s how it is supposed to be.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you, Yorishiro? Even if it is hastily prepared, you have to bring out a divine tool, or this won\u2019t even be a challenge.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is\u2026plenty enough.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama holds up her palm at Ates-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Light Suppression Palm]\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cNgh!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>It was at that instant, a gigantic and incredibly dense light divine power had blown away Ates-sama\u2019s whole body from the ground.</p><br/><p>What is with that dense lump of light divine power that is like air?!</p><br/><p>It was acting densely as if it were vapour.</p><br/><p>The light element, that is supposed to be the thinnest in terms of density, can do something like this?</p><br/><p>Ates-sama got hit by Yorishiro-sama\u2019s attack head on and tried to stand up with her eyes going in circles.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Holy Light Destruction]\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>From the foot of Yorishiro-sama, cracks similar to the web of a spider were being made, and when it arrived to the feet of Ates-sama, the light divine power that gushed from the pattern in the ground had blown Ates-sama flashily.</p><br/><p>\u201cGahagh!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama is strong!</p><br/><p>I knew already, but she is strong beyond common sense!</p><br/><p>She can ignore the common sense that there\u2019s the need to utilize divine tools to amplify divine power in order to actually use them in battle.</p><br/><p>And with that divine power that Yorishiro-sama is releasing from her hands, she is overwhelming Ates-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>But Ates-sama was a light hero in the past; there\u2019s no way she would allow herself to get defeated like this.</p><br/><p>She rushed straight towards Yorishiro-sama, and with that long spear, she thrusts it onto her!</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama didn\u2019t show any signs of taking an evasive stance.</p><br/><p>Different from the heroes match, that thrust of Ates-sama was filled completely with the intent to kill.</p><br/><p>It was at a point that was unavoidable already, when\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c[Holy Claw Form]\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama made the shape of a knife with her hand and light divine power came out from it, shaping into a sword and stopping the spear of Ates-sama.</p><br/><p>Of course, Yorishiro-sama didn\u2019t get wounded at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cOnee-sama, this is your fate. Caught in the poison of political power, you only thought about climbing up, and as a result, the place you arrived at was a precipice with nothing in it.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>After clashing blades, the two take distance.</p><br/><p>The light sword that was coming out from Yorishiro-sama\u2019s hand, by separating those fingers, the light sword separated into something that resembled fiendish spider legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour path is filled with too many corpses to be able to go back. Now that it has come to this, let me be the one pushing your back. Fall right down to the very depths where you won\u2019t be able to crawl back up anymore!!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><ul><li>241: Siblings battle</li></ul><br/><p>\u201c[Light Calamity Palm]\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Light divine power is shot from the wide open palm of Yorishiro-sama, and the palm of light grows bigger as it goes. This palm that felt as if it were the very hands of God also looked like it were a giant spider attacking with those 5 claw-like fingers.</p><br/><p>However, no matter which it is, there\u2019s no doubt that this is the light that will bring the destruction to Ates-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes-san\u2026no, Onee-sama.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama speaks in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my last advice. Listen to it properly.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThrow away your weapon at once. Show complete obedience to us. If you do, this will end without having the need to take your life.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I do that, what will happen to me?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have an idea already, right? You will be moved to some remote island that is impossible to escape from and you will live your whole life there. If we win the upcoming battle against the Demon Lords, you should be able to live your life peacefully there. Live your whole life without the need of worrying about political strifes.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>This must be Yorishiro-sama\u2019s last show of compassion.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way this person would truly wish to kill her blood-related sister.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fufufu, seriously, what a wretched little sister.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates answers back with scorn.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou knew from the very beginning that I would refuse that, right? But if you were to display compassion at the end, the people in the surroundings will see it as \u2018a Founder that had to drink down her tears and serve punishment to her relative\u2019. Thus, your position as Founder will get even more stable. \u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you already knew. It is good that Haine-san is still sleeping.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The giant light spider that was released by Yorishiro-sama swings its claws as if jumping onto its prey.</p><br/><p>\u201cFarewell, Onee-sama. I hope this is the last we see of this kind of foolishness between humans.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The light hand is swung down.</p><br/><p>This attack felt as if it were covering the whole training field. Me and the light knights, that were guarding the doors of this place in order to not let the now criminal Ates-sama escape, were overwhelmed by that tremendous power.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the end\u2026!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>The giant hand crashed onto the ground and waves of wild gales attested to the terrifying power this attack held.</p><br/><p>Ates-sama\u2019s body was most likely crushed by the giant hand.</p><br/><p>This is the last moment of the enchantress that had suddenly appeared in the Light Church and had stirred up the place with all her schemes and tricks.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is what you thought, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c?!!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>From below the light hand, the voice of a person unbelievably resonated.</p><br/><p>That voice is without doubt\u2026Ates-sama?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way. You are okay after receiving the \u2018Light Calamity Palm\u2019? With the light divine power that comes out from the light spear Cain, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama was also unable to hide her agitation in this unexpected situation.</p><br/><p>As if laughing at that agitation, Ates-sama speaks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It is true that with the light spear Cain I wouldn\u2019t be able to block an attack of this level\u2026\u2026 But Yorishiro, in the time that I was made to retire, did you think I did nothing?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn reality, the reason why I went so far as to use a farce like the hero match was to, of course, return to the Church, but what I sought for after that step wasn\u2019t to obtain political power as the previous hero.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Military power.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was purely for military power. In order to take away what you want from others, the most effective way is direct violence. The light spear Cain is my strength itself, however, that\u2019s not all there is.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it you are trying to get at!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile I was in retirement, I utilized the superfluous time I had to train, and managed to obtain a certain new power. In order to properly utilize this power, there was the need for a new divine tool. A different one from the light spear Cain. That\u2019s why I returned to the Church. The ore that serves as the material for the divine tools can only be found inside the Church after all!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>The next moment, the giant light hand of Yorishiro-sama disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama\u2019s expression of surprise was a clear indication that she herself wasn\u2019t the one that made it disappear.</p><br/><p>In that case, there\u2019s obviously only one person who could have possibly done it \u2014Ates-sama.</p><br/><p>The light hand had disappeared, and once again, that woman appeared in our field of vision with a spear over her shoulder.</p><br/><p>A second spear.</p><br/><p>In her right hand, there\u2019s the light spear Cain; and in her left hand, there\u2019s a second spear. This second unfamiliar spear was the total opposite of the light spear Cain; it was a dark spear dyed completely in black.</p><br/><p>\u2026Dark? No, I feel like that\u2019s not it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat negated my \u2018Light Calamity Palm\u2019 was that spear?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. This spear itself is my new power. What comes out by altering light divine power; the \u2018shadow\u2019 power.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u2018Shadow\u2019?!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>That word instantly made me think of Doraha-san; the shadow hero that holds the power of shadows.</p><br/><p>\u201cI secretly stole this second spear from the storage of the church, the \u2018shadow\u2019 divine tool. The trump card that allows me to show the power of \u2018shadow\u2019. I call it\u2026\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates-sama speaks in her characteristic manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cShadow spear, Abel.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>She then shrugs her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, that was close one. This was just finished the other day, you see. If things had played out at a sooner date, that attack just now would have been impossible for me to block, and I would have been crushed just like that.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the power of \u2018shadow\u2019, you absorbed my light divine power then.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama already knew the special trait of the \u2018shadow\u2019, so she says this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. Using the shadow spear Abel to absorb it, I release it with the light spear Cain. This cycle that was created from my long training is impossible to be broken by anyone!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates-sama swings her light spear Cain. From the tip of it, a threatening flash was shot.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro-sama dodged this deliberately slow attack of Ates-sama.</p><br/><p>That light easily destroyed a rampart in the training field.</p><br/><p>The rampart made big crumbling sounds as the splinters fly around. The light knights around were running to get away from it.</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this calamity, Yorishiro-sama\u2019s expression froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you understand now? That just now was the light divine power absorbed from you that had been shot just as it is. You are intelligent, Yorishiro, so you should already understand. All your attacks have already been rendered useless by this power.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>The light divine power that attacks Ates-sama will all be absorbed by the shadow spear Abel and the light spear Cain will return it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll preparations have been complete. Now then, Yorishiro, I will be taking the Founder position that should have originally been mine. While at it, I will be taking that life of yours as well. As you already know, I am a greedy one you see. Everything that belongs to you, I will be taking it all.\u201d (Ates)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-237-239-broken-thread\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 237-239 - Broken Thread\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-242-245-shadow-calamity-all-over-again\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 242-245 - Shadow Calamity all over again\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236344\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

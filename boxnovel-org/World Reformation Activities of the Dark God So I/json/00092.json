Because of that, it is a city that\u2019s isolated from cultural exchange.</p><br/><p>Moreover, at the west of it there\u2019s the \u2018Nameless Desert\u2019, and if they want to go to other settlements, there\u2019s the danger that they would enter this area, so it made the people not want to move about which strengthened the isolation even more.</p><br/><p>It is an isolated nation by nature, and from an outside perspective, it is practically an unexplored region riddled with mysteries.</p><br/><p>That is the Earth capital, Ishtar Blaze.</p><br/><p>The city where the people that worship one of the five Gods of Creation, Mother Earth Mantle.</p><br/><p>I am flying there alone with my flying machine.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, to think a Mother Monster would be right in the middle of a city where people live\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Ishtar Blaze is an enigmatic city, but it seems like the big tree at the center of the city is somewhat famous even in the outside settlements.</p><br/><p>Even if they indeed don\u2019t have much cultural exchange, there\u2019s still travelers that come to the Earth capital at times when travelling around the world.</p><br/><p>In the stories that they brag about, the first thing that comes out is the big tree that serves as the symbol of the city.</p><br/><p>The people of the Light, Fire, and Water Churches as well, when I asked them about the Earth capital, Ishtar Blaze, most of it was: \u2018ah, that city with the big tree huh. I don\u2019t know anything aside from that\u2019.</p><br/><p>And in truth, when I brought the information I got from Nova about Grandma Wood to Yorishiro, even she said: \u2018Eh, that was actually one?!\u2019 and was surprised.</p><br/><p>It is famous, but no one knows that this is one of the roots of those things called monsters. It seems like that\u2019s the state it is in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I am just a few ways away from the city where Grandma Wood is. Let\u2019s push it till the destination.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I turn to the back and say this cheerfully.</p><br/><p>\u2014No one is there.</p><br/><p>Right, this time, I am the only one in this journey.</p><br/><p>Even in this distance where I can already see the trunk of Grandma Wood, there\u2019s no one at my right or my left.</p><br/><p>This is one of the big links that has to be severed in order to eradicate the monsters from this world, but in this journey, I wanted to wrap this out on my own, and because of it, I decided on going alone.</p><br/><p>The light hero Karen-san, who I have always been with until now, for this time, I chose not to bring her with me. If I move with a hero, there\u2019s a lot of things that have to be accommodated first so it saves me in that part, and it could become a big matter later.</p><br/><p>And so, this time, I am alone.</p><br/><p>No well, isn\u2019t that good? My first journey alone. Let\u2019s go freely and carefreely without any constraints.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, everyone, let\u2019s go to the Earth capital, Ishtar Blaze~~!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Raising my hands high-up, I shout to the back\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah right, there\u2019s no one.</p><br/><p>\u2026I am not feeling lonely, okay?!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At the mountains that are quite a bit far before arriving at Ishtar Blaze, I got down the flying machine and hid it in the thicket.</p><br/><p>The reason why I am doing this is because Yorishiro gave me an advice in the time I was departing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Try your utmost to not bring any ethereal machines to Ishtar Blaze\u2019, she said.</p><br/><p>There was no detailed explanation.</p><br/><p>Giving me small amounts of various pieces of information and saying hinting at things is truly just like her.</p><br/><p>But Yorishiro is not the type to give advice thoughtlessly, so I should obediently follow what she said and leave the flying machine here.</p><br/><p>It is in outline something that\u2019s borrowed from the church, or more like, Yorishiro. If I break it, it is something that I definitely won\u2019t be able to repay.</p><br/><p>I camouflage it by placing grass on top of it and make a specific mark that only I would be able to tell it is one, and so, hiding complete.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s head to Ishtar Blaze by feet.</p><br/><p>From what I saw when I was riding the flying machine, it would take around 1 day to reach there by feet.</p><br/><p>Even so, if I was to go by feet from the very beginning, reaching her from Apollon City would have taken at the very least 1 month. I was able to arrive in only a few days, so the flying machine is still doing its job splendidly.</p><br/><p>I could proceed in the \u2018Nameless Desert\u2019 without fearing it. Development really does make humans powerful.</p><br/><p>Understanding how amazing the Ethereal era is once again, I continue onward, and at one point, the mountain road suddenly ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~~\u201d</p><br/><p>And then, there was an open field that extends as far as I could see\u2026but it was a bit different.</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>This is not something that was made naturally. A green ground that was prepared with human hands; a plantation.</p><br/><p>The sections are properly separated, and this agricultural land that had set crops growing from it were extending to the far horizon and from left and right to a point where I can\u2019t even see the end from here.</p><br/><p>What a big farming zone.</p><br/><p>Until now, I have seen many cities like Apollon City, Muspelheim, and Hydra Ville.</p><br/><p>As long as there\u2019s many humans living there, there\u2019s the need to supply their food in some way, and all settlements had their agricultural land in their surroundings.</p><br/><p>But I have not seen an agricultural land as big as this one.</p><br/><p>If this is all managed by Ishtar Blaze, this is not ordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe city that\u2019s under the divine protection of Mother Earth huh\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>These words leaked out from my mouth naturally.</p><br/><p>Mother Earth Mantle, who governs the earth, is the one who created the ground itself where the humans stand on.</p><br/><p>In that sense, it can be said that, for humans, she is the God that is the most familiar with them.</p><br/><p>The water blessing, the fire blessing, and even the wind blessing has to pass through the earth at least once before reaching the humans.</p><br/><p>The earth is the mother of all living beings. That\u2019s why only Mantle is not simply called Earth God, but called with affection as Mother Earth.</p><br/><p>The Earth Church that worships Mantle possessing such big farming land can be understandable.</p><br/><p>On the plantations, I could see people that looked like peasants here and there, and I could feel liveliness that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see in just any agricultural land.</p><br/><p>Peaceful and melodious; while thinking something like that, I walked on the road and then\u2026for some reason, I felt a gaze.</p><br/><p>Someone is watching me.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, I looked around, and there, my eyes found another strange thing.</p><br/><p>The shadow of someone. A silhouette in the shape of a human.</p><br/><p>At first, I was so surprised by the ever-extending agricultural land that I didn\u2019t notice it, but it is quite big. A height that would require two adult men in order to match its size.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s obviously not a human.</p><br/><p>A doll?</p><br/><p>A doll made of earth.</p><br/><p>A giant earth doll was moving alone in the plantation.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026a monster?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The special trait of this pseudo-lifeforms called monsters is that they release divine power aura, but you can\u2019t feel the beat of a soul.</p><br/><p>Sensing that irregularity, I noticed immediately that it was a monster, and after noticing one other thing, my alertness raised to its upper limit.</p><br/><p>Close to the feet of that earth-humanoid monster was\u2026a human!</p><br/><p>An elderly *oba-san*. &lt;granny&gt;</p><br/><p>Her legs have already gotten weak and she can\u2019t run at her full-speed. There\u2019s no way she can escape from that earth-humanoid.</p><br/><p>And then, the earth-humanoid took a step.</p><br/><p>At the direction of the Oba-san, as if saying \u2018I will crush you\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I immediately ran there.</p><ul><li>93: Golem</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cWatch out!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I run towards the place.</p><br/><p>Towards the place where the old woman was about to be crushed under the step of the giant earth-humanoid.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know the details, but there\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s a monster.</p><br/><p>I somehow made it in time and stand in between the Oba-san and the earth-humanoid.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard the voice of the Oba-san from behind.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no time to hesitate. If I take my time, not only the Oba-san, the surroundings will also suffer. I release dark matter and destroy the earth-humanoid without leaving any remains\u2014-is what I thought, but I felt a *gong* shock from my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuogh?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was hit by something from my back. Moreover, because it accurately hit my spine, it made a dangerously creaking sound and I fall in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDunno who ya are, but don\u2019t go jumpin\u2019 out suddenly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one hitting me was the Oba-san.</p><br/><p>She gave me one hit with the cane she is holding, moreover, it seems that cane was stronger than I expected, the pain coursing through me was not letting me move at all.</p><br/><p>As this happened, the earth-humanoid was approaching.</p><br/><p>The steps that were going *doshin* *doshin* were sinking around half of its feet into the earth every time.</p><br/><p>This is bad. \u2018At this rate, the Oba-san and I will be crushed beneath this guy\u2019s feet!\u2019, just when I thought of this\u2026the earth-humanoid passes by the Oba-san and I, and heads towards an unknown destination.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh? Wut?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>When the earth-humanoid moves forward for a while, it turns around, and returns here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHua?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought we would be crushed this time for sure, but as expected, the earth-humanoid passes by us, and after moving for a while, it turns back\u2026and continues that process.</p><br/><p>\u201cYa see, this plantation here\u2026I had it take a rest last year. And so, I thought about planting somethin\u2019 again this year, so before that, I be thinking ther\u2019 be the need to mix the earth fer a bit ya see.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Oba-san says this with a mixed accent. &lt;TL: Please treat me gently on the accent &gt;-&lt;. If there\u2019s any sort of tips you can give me on that, I would appreciate it a lot.&gt;</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaving it to that child is really comfortin\u2019. My legs already roughed up ya see, just walkin\u2019 with these legs won\u2019t be mixing no earth. Ya can\u2019t just suddenly stand on its way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? For some reason, it has turned into me being scolded?</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But that\u2019s a monster\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Because the pain in my back is still not going away, my speech is still not going back to normal.</p><br/><p>She looks like that, but her strength is impressive. Is this the hidden power of a farmer?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Could it be yer\u2026an outsider?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOutsider?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cTalking about people that came from the outside. The first thin\u2019 people who don\u2019t know this place get surprised by is that after all. That child ya see, it\u2019s called a Golem. The blessin\u2019 of Mother Earth-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, the Oba-san points at the giant earth-humanoid that is still continuing the plowing.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Golem?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. See fer yerself. There\u2019s some over there and there too.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the places where the Oba-san points at, there\u2019s certainly big human-shaped shadows plowing the land, digging canals, helping out in the harvesting; they were working in the fields restlessly.</p><br/><p>These so called Golems have a silhouette that\u2019s practically identical to that of humans aside from the size, so in this flat agricultural land with such perspective in it, I ended up not noticing it.</p><br/><p>But\u2026eh? Golem? But, they are monsters, right?</p><br/><p>The monsters are helping out in the farm?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, yer quite the brave lad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some time has passed since then, the pain in my back finally receded, and the Oba-san was treating me with tea.</p><br/><p>While I was gazing at the Golem at the plantation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo ya misunderstood thinkin\u2019 that I was being attacked by a Golem and went to save me eh. Looks like I did somethin\u2019 bad to ya then. Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, in the end, it was my misunderstanding, so I should be the one apologizing. Not only did I cause you trouble, I was even about to get in the way of your work.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine~. Even a granny like me gets happy when a youn\u2019 un tries to save her-sa ne. Here, eat some pickles too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Thanks for the meal.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was eating and drinking what was being brought to me.</p><br/><p>A blue sky and a green plain that extends further than the eye can see. The sounds that enter my ears are the steps of the Golem that\u2019s working on its own.</p><br/><p>What a peaceful space.</p><br/><p>I felt a gaze and look around. In the skies, there\u2019s the shadow of a bird of prey that might be an eagle or a hawk. It is probably aiming at the mice that might be running around the plantation.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut well, most outsiders get surprised by it-sa ne. Humans and monsters bein\u2019 friendly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose Golems, do they really not attack people?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That child is just as good natured as ya-sa ne.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe it has finished the plowing; the Golem that was moving back and forth only, for the first time stops its trajectory and heads to where we are.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks fer ya hard work.\u201d</p><br/><p>When it arrives right in front of us, the Golem stops on its own, and the Oba-san seems to have begun touching the body of the Golem.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surface of the Golem suddenly had cracks appearing from it, moreover, this covered its whole body and, finally, it crumbles and becomes rubble.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What was that?! What happened?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, youn\u2019 un. The work is over, so I had it take a rest-sa ne.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, there was one piece of brick in the hand of the Oba-san.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have something like that before though.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis be the identity of the Golem-sa ne.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? This brick is?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I later learned that this brick is called a Life Block, also called as Golem Core.</p><ul><li>94: Utopia</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cYa see, ya have to write what ya want it to do in this Life Block.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Oba-san was writing something on the brick with a bamboo shoot or something like that. Maybe the surface is pretty soft.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, ya throw it ta the earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>After doing that, earth begins to gather on the brick, swells big, and then, it steadily shapes up and becomes the silhouette of a human.</p><br/><p>The Golem appears once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it taken form, it be movin\u2019 as ordered. Now, get on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? We are riding it?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The Oba-san has already climbed on top of the arm of the Golem and has reached to its shoulder.</p><br/><p>For an elder person, she is quite the dextrous one.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wrote a request ta give us a ride till my house. Ya\u2019ll be headin\u2019 to the city as well, right? If ya walk normally, ya\u2019ll be taking all day.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is true. I was planning on reaching Istar Blaze by today, but because I was talking with the Oba-san, quite a lot of time ended up passing.</p><br/><p>At this rate, the sun would sink quite a few ways before I reach the city and will be completely dark.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I decided on taking up the offer.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>For an outsider, the movements of the Golem look sluggish, but because of its big frame, its steps are also wide, and allowed it to reach the objective at a far higher speed than that of the feet of a human.</p><br/><p>Earth capital, Ishtar Blaze.</p><br/><p>The big tree that was overwhelming even when seeing it from a real long distance, was even more overwhelming when seeing it up close.</p><br/><p>So this is Grandma Wood.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven when I look up, I can\u2019t see its top.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Moreover, the thickness of the trunk would probably be spacious enough to place the Light Grand Church of Apollon City on it.</p><br/><p>And if we were to take into account the roots that spread from it, it would probably take up about 1/10 of the whole Ishtar Blaze.</p><br/><p>But aside from that, there\u2019s nothing strange about the tree itself. At least at a glance, that is.</p><br/><p>This is one of the sources for the calamity called monsters; one of the four Mother Monsters. This is hard to believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it? Tree-sama is incredible, don\u2019t ya think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Oba-san once again returns the Golem into rubble, and places the block that remains into her bosom.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis be the pride of us, ya know. No matter where ya search in the whole world, there be no tree as big as \u2018Great Pillar-sama\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Pillar-sama?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone in the city calls it that way. A great tree-sama that brings forth blessings ta humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>I once again felt a gaze, so I look around. There\u2019s a lot more Golems walking around the city of Ishtar Blaze compared to the time in the agricultural land. They are carrying luggage, carrying people, repairing houses; they are doing all this gallantly.</p><br/><p>In other words, this place really is a place where\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Humans and monsters are coexisting?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of this be thanks ta Great Pillar-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oba-san says this with slight pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cTraveller, can ya see it from here? There be people clinging onto Great Pillar-sama, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I strain my eyes to see where Oba-san is pointing at, I certainly did see it. At the surface of the thick and big tree, there\u2019s some sort of human-looking things clinging onto it.</p><br/><p>Rock climbing? No, it is a tree so\u2026wood climbing?</p><br/><p>At any rate, there\u2019s people that are at an altitude that makes you question just how did they climb so far up\u2026and just what in the hell are they doing?</p><br/><p>\u201cThey be gettin\u2019 this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Oba-san says as she points at the brick.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Then\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Life Block comes from Great Pillar-sama. It protrudes from the surface of the tree ya see, and, at the end, it falls. But it be dangerous if it were left there till it falls and hits the head of someone, right? That\u2019s why people of the church retrieve ones that are about ta fall.\u201d</p><br/><p>And with the testimony of the Oba-san, I was convinced of one thing; the Golems are without doubt earth monsters. The Life Blocks that serve as the core of this Golems, and the big tree that creates these Life Blocks.</p><br/><p>That big tree is a \u2018monster that gives birth to monsters\u2019; it means that there\u2019s no doubt it is a Mother Monster.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hm? Please wait.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>A part of it bothered me and I ask.</p><br/><p>I point at the people that are still doing work at the surface of the tree.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that the people picking the Life Blocks there are members of the Earth Church, right? Then does that mean that tree is under the management of the Earth Church?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that be right.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, I once again felt a gaze.</p><br/><p>Since the time I got closer to Ishtar Blaze, I have been feeling the gaze of an unknown someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf ya want ta, I can bring ya ta the Grand Crimson Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grand Crimson Palace? Is she referring to the Earth Church\u2019s headquarters?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is rare for a traveller ta come all the way here after all. The people of the Church also want ta hear the stories of the outside, so they be telling us that whenever we meet with an outsider, we bring them ta their place. It seems like they be providing lodgin\u2019 and food, so it is not a bad deal for ya either, ya know.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>In order to learn what\u2019s happening in this city, it is crucial that I get in contact with the Earth Church.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I will take you up on that offer. Sorry to have you take so much care of me.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have a grandchild, ya see. Right now they be living far away, but when I treat a stranger with kindness, I feel like that person will also treat my grandchild with kindness as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah, please stop that.</p><br/><p>It reminds me of my mother and father in my village, and it brings me to tears.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-89-91-visiting-the-mother\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 89-91 - Visiting the mother\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-95-97-sage\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 95-97 - Sage\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236283\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

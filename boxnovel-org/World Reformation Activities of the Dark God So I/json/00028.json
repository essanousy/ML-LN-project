Looks like they got quite close in the time I wasn\u2019t looking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san! Are you okay?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the fire cow?! I can\u2019t see that guy. Just what happened?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The heroes ask questions in rapid succession.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s the fire cow Phalaris, it is here.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I point at the ground, and with that, the gaze of the two heroes were led by it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt shrunk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that place, there\u2019s a fainted fire cow Phalaris that has all extremities twitching.</p><br/><p>But, it is small.</p><br/><p>It is incomparably smaller than the time we encountered it. It is one whole size smaller than a normal calf.</p><br/><p>If asked how it ended up in this way, it is because of the dark matter that I continuously hit him with.</p><br/><p>As the dark matter that destroys the divine power entered its body, the fire divine power that composed the body of this guy was erased thoroughly, and as a result, its volume decreased and can\u2019t even spit out fire anymore.</p><br/><p>It is a mystery how it got several times as small as this, but it is the type of mystery that doesn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>I have already completely erased the fire God hearth that was inside of it, and it can\u2019t release heat anymore.</p><br/><p>We splendidly achieved the subjugation of the fire cow Phalaris.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy\u2026because of this guy, our city was almost about to be destroyed!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack runs towards it with anger seething.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be finishing it! Bringing an end to the monster that has been destroying this land for so many years, that\u2019s my duty as the fire hero!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The arm that was equipped with the knuckle was the very definition of a blunt weapon.</p><br/><p>Even if she didn\u2019t concentrate divine power in it, if she were to punch with something like that, it would easily destroy the cranium of Phalaris who has became as small as a calf.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, I grab her arm and\u2026stop her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Killing it would be a waste.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?! Why did you stop me?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fire cow Phalaris has already lost all of its destructive power. The massive fire divine power inside of it has disappeared, and with this small body, it won\u2019t even be able to step on a dog. In other words, it is in a state that\u2019s completely harmless.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what of it?! Even if it\u2019s harmless, a monster is still a monster\u2014\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why. How about exhibiting it and show it around the normal populace?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d \u201c?!!\u201d (?!!)</p><br/><p>Not only Mirack and Karen-san, even the related party was showing surprise as they open their eyes wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonsters will disappear once they are killed anyways. Then, before that, showing a weakened monster like this to the people would make it easier for them to get a feel of it. That \u2018the monster has been defeated\u2019.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might be true, but\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can turn into a good event for the church and it can serve as publicity as well. It might increase the number of recruits.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>(Wait wait wait! Dark God Entropy! Is your aim possibly\u2026?!) (Nova)</p><br/><p>At that moment, a voice I could only hear came from the inside of the fire cow Phalaris.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s inside this fire cow is the Fire God Nova. Being seen as one of the five Gods of Creation, it arbitrarily got angered at the humans who had thinned their faith towards him and tried to bring divine punishment by reincarnating in a monster; in other words, an idiot.</p><br/><p>For that sake, he reincarnated in the fire cow Phalaris that he created himself and tuned to its very limits, but now that the transcendent power has been erased by my dark matter without leaving a single trace behind, the current him is lower than a cow.</p><br/><p>The soul of the Fire God Nova probably already wants to be liberated from this useless body and return to the God realm.</p><br/><p>(As I thought, you are really\u2014!) (Nova)</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s right. I won\u2019t be letting you go so easily, damn God.</p><br/><p>Your soul that has been reincarnated will not be liberated unless its vessel has died. In other words, until you die, you will have to continue living as a cow!) (Haine)</p><br/><p>(As I thought! You\u2026you intend to seal me in this cow body!! This Fire God Nova!!) (Nova)</p><br/><p>(Having you easily return to the God realm and have you scheme a new mischief would be unpleasant. So, calling it sealing is not that wrong. Fire God Nova who has his soul sealed inside a powerless imitation of a cow.</p><br/><p>I will count this as revenge for sealing me in the past.) (Haine)</p><br/><p>(You damn ogre! Demon! God of darkness!! Just kill me already! Kill me and return me to the God Realm right this instant! This Fire God Nova, one of the rulers of this world, living as a pitiful and powerless cow is just\u2026!) (Nova)</p><br/><p>(Well, if you don\u2019t like it, find an opportunity to kill yourself. I will be doing my best in stopping you every time you try it though. I will tie a rope around your neck and pull you as you go \u2018moo moo\u2019 in pointless struggle.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s drag you back to the Fire Church just like this. It will be mostly by foot. Don\u2019t think you will be getting a favorable treatment like having you ride a horse carriage.) (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026U-Understood. This is unheard of but, what you say does have a point. I will try talking with the people of the Fire Church. But, can I ask you one question?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, just what in the world are you?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The one who asked me the question was Karen-san who interrupted the words of Mirack.</p><br/><p>With an even more worried face than that of her recovered friendship with Mirack.</p><br/><p>\u201cI scouted you thinking that you could become a reliable comrade. But you have surpassed my expectations way too many times. Leaving aside your decisiveness in fixing my friendship with Mirack-chan\u2026you blocked the heat flash of that gigantic monster and beat it up until it became this small. That\u2019s not normal.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also wanted to ask that. I only thought of you as a follower of Karen but, just what are you? At the very least, you are a hero or something that surpasses that. Moreover, that power I saw from afar\u2026that thing that I can only describe as a pitch black-something, it was not fire divine power or light divine power, it wasn\u2019t wind, water, and earth either.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Well, as expected, they could see how I was using my dark matter.</p><br/><p>How should I explain it?</p><br/><p>I reincarnated in this world and wanted to interact with it as a human, so I can\u2019t just announce that \u2018I am the reincarnation of the Dark God!\u2019.</p><br/><p>In the first place, is the existence of the Dark God even known?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I will explain it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of a third party resonates.</p><ul><li>29: Light Princess, Dark Hero</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>In this place that was recently the territory of an atrocious monster, the presence of a person was felt.</p><br/><p>When we look at that place, there\u2019s the figure of a familiar woman with pure snow white priest robe covering her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are\u2026Yorishiro-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro?! The current founder of the Light Church, that Yorishiro?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Hearing that name, Mirack showed visible agitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You know about that person?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOr more like, you don\u2019t know about her? You are a member of the Light Church, aren\u2019t you?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I am a beansprout that recently joined it though.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well, I do know. That person is famous after all.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, just by being a founder, you are famous, but that Yorishiro alone is special. She is a woman after all, moreover, an exceptional case where she obtained the position of a founder in the young age of 18. The rumors say that she kicked her father who was the previous founder into the extremities of a political strife. She is famously known as a \u2018scary woman\u2019.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Is she someone like that?</p><br/><p>She is covered by a robe and a veil, so I can\u2019t see most of her skin at all, but I can tell from her atmosphere alone that she is a beauty.</p><br/><p>That Yorishiro send a gaze to us through her veil.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, our hero Karen-san. Good work in the subjugation of the fire cow Phalaris. And the fire hero Mirack-san who cooperated as well, I give you my thanks as the light church\u2019s founder.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026well\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The characteristic solemnity that Yorishiro exudes is overwhelming Mirack as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, Yorishiro-sama, what did you mean with those words just now?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san who is the one in this group that is the most acquainted with her asks her boldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also baffled by Yorishiro-sama being in this kind of place, but what you said about \u2018explaining\u2019, can I take it as you saying you will be explaining what Haine-san is?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, hero. For the sake of that, let me ask one question first. Hero Karen, do you know about the Gods that created this world?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being asked so suddenly, Karen-san also gets confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it is the five Gods of Creation. The Light Goddess Inflation we follow, the Fire God Nova, Water God Coacervate, Wind God Quasar, and the Mother Earth Mantle, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. But what if there\u2019s not only five Gods of Creation?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that question, not only Karen-san, Mirack also raised a shocked voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one other God of Creation. That God\u2019s name is Entropy, the God that governs darkness.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Finally, Mirack couldn\u2019t take it anymore and interjected.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell I could believe that?! There being another God of Creation is just\u2026moreover, a God of Darkness that sounds evil no matter how you hear it\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cFire hero, Mirack-san. Darkness in itself is by no means evil. In this world, half of it is covered by it in the night along with the day. The sleep that people take. That is the domain of the darkness, but it is also a necessary time for humans to rest.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Yorishiro-sama, if this Dark God Entropy really exists, why didn\u2019t we know of it until now? Like a Dark Church equal to that of the other Gods. Wouldn\u2019t it be fine to have one?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat just means Entropy is that much of a special God. But, no matter how much of a hidden God it is, the darkness part that composes this world exists. In humans as well.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a darkness part in humans as well?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHero Karen, just like how your light element is prominent, and the fire hero there excels in fire element, there\u2019s also humans who possess great dark element in their body. A person that has been born with big darkness power is\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cCould that be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it possible that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The gaze of Karen-san and Mirack turn towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Haine-san was born with strong inherent dark element and is a person that can control that power; in other words, the hero of darkness.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2019How is that?\u2019</p><br/><p>The gaze of Yorishiro was telling me this as she looked straight at me.</p><br/><p>At that moment, I was sure, about the identity of this founder of the Light Church, Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>This one is the same, the same as me. And while on it, she is also the same as that cow that lays fallen on the ground.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro is a human, and at the same time, not a human. Her soul is not that of a human.</p><br/><p>Something that\u2019s not human, in other words, a God that has reincarnated in the body of a human.</p><br/><p>Light Goddess, Inflation.</p><br/><p>So you reincarnated into a human as well.</p><ul><li>30: The reunion of Gods comes to an end for now</li></ul><br/><p>\u2026After that, we separated in order to perform our own duties.</p><br/><p>Mirack pulled the fire cow Phalaris that has turned small and returned to Muspelheim where the Fire Church is.</p><br/><p>That useless cow will be under the care of the Fire Church, and just as I proposed, they will have him displayed to the public in a few days.</p><br/><p>Mirack herself also formally accepted to cooperate with Karen-san.</p><br/><p>Rather than this being because we were able to fulfill the condition of defeating the fire cow, it was more because she herself had a change in mindset.</p><br/><p>Being able to fix her broken friendship with Mirack, Karen-san was happy from the bottom of her heart.</p><br/><p>But well, this talk about heroes cooperating with each other has not gone through the acceptance of the Light Church itself, so it will probably be getting troublesome from here on.</p><br/><p>Even so, this is a talk for the future.</p><br/><p>Karen-san, who was all tired from the monster subjugation, returned to her room as soon as she got back to the Light Church and apparently went right to sleep without even taking a bath.</p><br/><p>And then, I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven you reincarnated. I didn\u2019t know about that.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The room of the Light Church\u2019s founder.</p><br/><p>In reality, it is a room where only a few chosen ones can enter; in other words, I am in sacred precincts.</p><br/><p>I was in the room of the Light Church\u2019s founder with only the two of us.</p><br/><p>The founder herself is a young woman. In normal circumstances, a situation like this would be impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you would be reincarnating as a human, so I hurriedly followed you-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Is what the young founder said.</p><br/><p>Maybe because she is in her own room, she has taken off the veil she always has on. It is a face that definitely enters in the category of beauty, but unfortunately, thinking about her inside, I can\u2019t be charmed by it.</p><figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_6431\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Damn bazookas in my Isekai</figcaption></figure><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the identity of the founder Yorishiro is the reincarnation of the Light Goddess, Inflation.</p><br/><p>One of the five Gods of Creation that sealed me 1,600 years ago, and also the very same person that undid the seal 18 years ago.</p><br/><p>After that, I decided on reincarnating as a human and became Kuromiya Haine but, she also reincarnated as a human?</p><br/><p>Moreover, she became the founder of the Light Church that follows her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, why?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by why?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout the reason why you reincarnated as a human.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, because I wanted to enjoy being a human together with you-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Saying this, the Light Goddess Inflation\u2026I mean, Yorishiro came at me with her ripen body.</p><br/><p>\u201cOooi?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis inconvenient flesh restricts us, but with it, there\u2019s also pleasures we can enjoy that we couldn\u2019t as Gods-desu wa. For example, giving birth to the child of your loved one.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOryaaa!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I hurriedly jump aside and take my distance from Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaving aside the joking, I want to enter the real matter.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, I was serious-desu wa yo. Just how long have I waited for the day I would meet your human self. We will have to make the preparations for the wedding announcement\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>This woman, did her animal instincts get even denser when she became a human?</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, I am surprised you were able to line up such a lie. That thing about being the hero of darkness.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a setting I thought up since long before-desu wa. I thought that there would definitely be a time when you would gather the attention of the world. That\u2019s also the reason why I obtained the position of founder. Authority is the best catalyst to reinforce persuasion after all.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>It might be just as Yorishiro says.</p><br/><p>The existence of the Dark God Entropy, since the time I was sealed at the creation era, no one ever knew of me.</p><br/><p>And then, if after 1,600 years there\u2019s a shocking revelation like there being \u2018one other God of Creation\u2019, it would be hard to believe. Karen-san and Mirack who heard about it were in part able to believe it mostly because those were the words of the founder of the Light Church.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I were to say \u2018this is an oracle from the Light Goddess\u2019, they would have obediently believed it. What innocent children-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than an oracle, they are the words of the person herself though\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>At any rate, thanks to Yorishiro calming down the situation, I was able to evade the questioning of Karen-san and Mirack. But it is not like I have avoided all the questioning.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been revealed that there\u2019s the power of dark matter after all.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that fine-desu ka? A special power that can only be used by one person in the world. Something as renowned as that will resound in the whole world-desu wa. You will be doing a lot of things in the future anyways, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\u2026is what I want to say, but\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Since leaving the countryside a few days ago, I have learned about a lot of things in this world.</p><br/><p>The civilization that grew with the discovery of a material called ethereal. And because of it, the Gods are being left behind, and they are trying a variety of ways to change that flow.</p><br/><p>Even if you cut off a few humans, the problems that will be born in this organization called a church will continue appearing.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t just stay unrelated to that. I am not the Dark God Entropy, but Kuromiya Haine who came from the countryside.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that if becoming somewhat famous in the human world will bring benefits to it, there\u2019s no reason to be against it. Let\u2019s do our best from now on as well. Just like how the humans in this world do their best to live in it.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will be involving yourself in this world, not as a God, but a human huh. That\u2019s just like you, Haine-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, that\u2019s how it is. I am counting on you from here on out as well, Founder-sama. I am supposed to be your subordinate after all.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you so wish, I can provide you a position that\u2019s a lot higher than that-desu wa. You will be staying the night here, right?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I escape from the room of the founder, and retire.</p><br/><p>And so, like this, my life as the human -Kuromiya Haine- genuinely begins.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-25-27-dark-god-vs-fire-god\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 25-27 - Dark God vs Fire God\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-31-32-the-curtains-rise-to-the-interaction-of-humans\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 31-32 - The curtains rise to the interaction of humans\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236257\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

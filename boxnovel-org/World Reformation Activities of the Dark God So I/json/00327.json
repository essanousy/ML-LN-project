God of the earth!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A different voice enters the discussion of the God and heroes.</p><br/><p>The serious voice of the Demon Lord Michael that sounded as if he was shouldering the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying the Gods don\u2019t forgive the existence of Demon Lords? Are you saying monsters are living beings that shouldn\u2019t hold hearts?\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Monsters are not even living beings. They are tools.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>The so clear response of Mantle made Michael gulp his breath audibly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTools created by the Gods for the sake of the Gods. The Gods that were flustered by how the humans stopped praying after civilization developed created monsters so that they would pray again. If monsters threaten the humans, they would look for help by praying.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, wasn\u2019t an unbelievable reality revealed just now?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning that they were pumps the Gods set up? The Gods are unexpectedly sly.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The humans were showing agitation at one of the world\u2019s secrets that was revealed by Mantle as if it were a passing thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the tools used in order for humans to pray, so there\u2019s no need for tools to have hearts. That\u2019s why we created monsters out of pure divine power and didn\u2019t place a soul in them. It isn\u2019t possible for things like that to have a heart.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Kugh!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael silently tightened his fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou monsters have deviated from the duty that us Gods have set for you. That\u2019s why you must be destroyed. Monsters were created for the sake of humans, and yet, if those monsters were to destroy those humans, it would go against their purpose.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>Everything about Mantle is simple and straight, and that made it hard to refute.</p><br/><p>And yet, this feeling of wanting to refute it with all they had\u2026everyone in this place felt that way.</p><br/><p>An argument that has no place where to hit -this might be what you would call the weight of a God\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also ask! Earth God!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>Uriel speaks now.</p><br/><p>He was utterly in fear due to the blade hell of Sasae-chan but, right now, his body was overflowing with strength.</p><br/><p>His cut off leg had already been regenerated, even if it was a hasty job.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026was born from the earth mother that you had created.\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>Earth Mother Monster, Grandma Wood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose memories may be hazy, but I have inherited them. You say that monsters were originally made to do evil to the humans that had forgotten their prayers, but I think that only us earth monsters are different.\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>It is exactly right.</p><br/><p>The only type of monster that Grandma Wood gave birth to were Golems. Different from the other monsters, they obeyed the orders of humans and lived together with humans.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why the people of Ishtar Blaze that worship Mantle had grown fond of the Golems and respected Grandma Wood as they called it \u2018Great Pillar-sama\u2019.</p><br/><p>Until the great fall that Mantle created, that is.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was against the other Gods. Even if humans didn\u2019t pray to me, I wanted to be of use to them. That\u2019s why I created monsters that would help humans rather than ones that attacked them.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe birth of Golems had that kind of reason behind it\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Earth Demon Lord-san, I didn\u2019t think that an existence like you would be born under this feeling of \u2018wanting to help humans\u2019 that I placed when creating Golems. Same as the other Demon Lord-sans, to try and destroy the human-sans\u2026 It is completely contrary to the wishes of your creator. Truly bad kids.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>Mantle announces.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be destroying you for the sake of the human-sans.\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>Uriel\u2019s voice was filled with anger.</p><br/><p>What was overflowing from his body was resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were born for the sake of humans\u2026for the sake of Gods? Where is our own reason for living?! Are you saying that it is wrong to live for our own sake?!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is exactly as Uriel-san says!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san agrees to the words of the demon.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter the living being, even if it doesn\u2019t have a soul, it should still have the right to live for their own sake! No one can deny that!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter if you are a God, there\u2019s no way it is okay for you to arbitrarily decide the fate of the ones living on the surface world! Humans might end up getting that treatment as well, so I can\u2019t say that this is someone else\u2019s problem!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, we will be completely in opposition to this! Also, return Sasae\u2019s body! Her body is not something that a God can do whatever they want with it!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The human team was obviously against the words of Mantle.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt goes without saying that we will also be fighting.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Water God has already given us his blessing, so I will be going against it with confidence.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Michael and Gabriel were obviously in fighting stance.</p><br/><p>There was not a single one in favor of Mantle.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Eh? Uhm\u2026uhm\u2026!\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>Seeing this situation, the usual habit of hers appears.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026I am doing this for the sake of the human-sans. I was thinking of being useful to the human-sans!\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd we are saying that\u2019s unneeded consideration! We humans don\u2019t need your help!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis gave the final blow with her sharp tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cMantle.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t just stay silent either.</p><br/><p>Bringing her back might have really been a mistake.</p><br/><p>Her way too simplistic way of acting, no matter how much you think for the sake of humans, it doesn\u2019t end up being good for the humans.</p><br/><p>Before an irreversible catastrophe occurs, I might have to erase her once again into the deep depths of the Black Hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, it looks like no matter what we say, we won\u2019t reach an understanding.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Even the Dark God Entropy, that is considered as the ultimate God, can\u2019t change her.</p><br/><p>To try and connect this Mother Earth God to the other existences.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true-dasu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201d?!!!!!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh?!</p><br/><p>That voice just now\u2026?!</p><br/><p>The voice that only had the words of Mantle coming out\u2026this time around, the words of someone else came out.</p><br/><p>The real owner of that voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Earth Hero, Gonbee Sasae! If it be the words of the Mother Earth, Mantle-sama, I be following \u2018em no matter what they be-dasu! That be the way of the Earth nation-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><ul><li>328: Foolish God</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chan?!\u201d \u201cSasae?!\u201d \u201cSasae-chi?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones who were agitated by the sudden mention of this name were her very friends, Karen-san, Mirack, and Celestis.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, is that really Sasae-chan?! It is hard to believe but, is it really Sasae-chan?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am-dasu! The incompetent, Gonbee Sasae! Even if mah boobs got bigger, I still be everyone\u2019s friend-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan says with strength.</p><br/><p>It looks like her body wasn\u2019t taken over even when Mantle was residing in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, what be this-dasu ka?! Everyone ganging up on us. Don\u2019t go bullying our God Mantle-sama-dasu! I be stepping in and say no-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Is what Sasae-chan says with a bad temper.</p><br/><p>What is the meaning of this?!</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026but you see, Sasae-chan, we can\u2019t agree to what Mantle-sama said. Monsters are already not the same as before\u2014!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cEeeeh?!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Her statements were completely absurd and, everytime she enforces her words, her boobs shake, which overwhelmed the three young ladies.</p><br/><p>It also overwhelmed me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe important thing be whether I believe in mah God or not-dasu! In the face of the words of mah God, everything else be a trifling matter-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeh?! I don\u2019t think it is such a trifling matter though!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-neechan, Mirack-neechan, and Celestis-neechan; each one of ya have yer own God ye believe in-dasu. And fer me, that be Mantle-sama-dasu. It be because we believe in our God that those words be priceless, ain\u2019t it-dasu ka?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat be why, if it be the words of Mantle-sama, I will follow \u2018em-dasu! No need for context-dasu! I will cut the Demon Lord-sans, stick \u2018em up, and cut \u2018em up again-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cTorture?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>To think Sasae-chan would agree with Mantle!</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t this feel like deja vu?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think so too, Celestis? Actually, I also do!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Is what Mirack and Celestis say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first time we met Sasae-chan, she had received an oracle from the Mother Earth God, and when we showed opposition to those words, Sasae-chan got angry and it even ended up in a fight!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd now, Mantle is speaking personally and, when we went against it, Sasae-chi got angry!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will definitely fall into the same pattern!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>For the five Grand Churches, the Gods they worship are absolute existences.</p><br/><p>Denying them can even end up in killing.</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan is faithfully applying this, and she is about to apply it now.</p><br/><p>\u201cMantle-sama created the earth we stand, sit, and sleep in, and she also nurtures the food that we eat everyday-dasu! She even sent Golems that were the friends of humans. Not believing in the Mother Earth God-sama after all this would be ungrateful-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chan!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people of the Earth nation believe in Mother Earth-sama in anything and everything-dasu! Someone that doesn\u2019t believe ain\u2019t religious-dasu! Oi, the Demon Lord there!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>Being pointed the scythe at him, Uriel was greatly scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat ya gonna do-dasu? By the will of Mantle-sama, I will be destroying ya-dasu. If ye don\u2019t want that, ya better fight back-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn mah Ishtar Blaze, when we don\u2019t know whose side be the correct one, there be only one thing the Earth people do-dasu! Kill each other-dasu! The one that dies be the one in the wrong-dasu! Got that-dasu ka?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeeeeeh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was quite the messed up statement.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my! Oh my! My hero-san will believe in me?!\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously course-dasu! Someone that doesn\u2019t believe saying they be followers would be the lie-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026the first time I have been told that\u2026 I am so happy!\u201d (Mantle)</p><br/><p>Before coming here, the grandma of Sasae-chan told me this: \u2018Sasae-chan resembles herself\u2019.</p><br/><p>When she was young, she looked absent-minded and as if she lacked the ability to think, but that\u2019s exactly why she was able to push through with a clear mind and head straight towards what she believed in.</p><br/><p>What was born from this was the legend that would make even crying children silent, the \u2018Taker by the roots\u2019.</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan had inherited that trait almost completely and possesses the ability to believe in something blindly like her grandma.</p><br/><p>A domain that half-baked sagaciousness wouldn\u2019t be able to reach; a foolishness that knows no bounds.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s try leaving it in Sasae-chan\u2019s hands.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>My decision created confusion in my surroundings, but I felt like betting on it.</p><br/><p>At times, the foolishness of Sasae-chan would be the source of trouble and would irritate the short-fused ones. But that foolishness also, at times, can change the impossible to possible.</p><br/><p>It is not some plain foolishness, it is an extra-large foolishness inherited from the blood of a legend.</p><br/><p>It might be able to achieve big things that the regular intelligent ones wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve!</p><br/><p>Achieve things that even I, the Dark God Entropy, gave up on\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way too simplistic heart of Mantle; trying to connect it to others is impossible, but she might be able to make that impossible into reality.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>In this battle with the Demon Lords, the humans have even managed to change the hearts of the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>In that case, she should be able to change the heart of a God too \u2014with that trusting heart of hers that\u2019s on the level of being foolish.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand up and accept the challenge, Uriel.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will fight alone.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael spoke to him from the back and the tree human Demon Lord trembled heavily at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like each of us Demon Lords have to be tested -in what we are and what we should do. We have to fight our own battles and reach those answers.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, what are you saying, Michael?\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this stage where the earth hero and Earth God are standing, Uriel, this is no doubt your stage as well. Gabriel and I have done our fight too and we got a vague view of the path we should advance on. Uriel, you must take that step as well!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>The Fire Demon Lord says this with burning passion.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you currently don\u2019t have a decision, one should appear after battle! Clash to your heart\u2019s content! Clash, break, mix those broken pieces, to the point that you can\u2019t even tell what was its previous form, and find an answer that you haven\u2019t found until now!! \u2026In other words, let there be hot-bloodedness!!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>Now that those words have come out, he has no choice but to accept.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh geez! I get it!!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>Uriel shouts annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was my intention in the first place anyways!! Earth hero, if I fight you and win, that means I should be the one to keep on living! I will bring judgement. Monsters are the ones who should keep on living in this surface world!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit-dasu! Makes it worth cutting-dasu yo!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan was her charming self as always as she takes a stance with her all-cutting scythe.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s begin-dasu! A battle where I will believe thoroughly in Mantle-sama and will decide the way of living of the Demon Lord-sans-dasu!! No grudges no matter who dies-dasu yo!!\u201d (Sasae)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-325-326-progress\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 325-326 - Progress\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-329-331-like-a-maelstrom\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 329-331 - Like a maelstrom\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236379\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

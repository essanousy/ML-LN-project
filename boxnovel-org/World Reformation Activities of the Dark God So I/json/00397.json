The secret of the Gods, the secret of the world.</p><br/><p>The scale is way too big to entrust to us humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, the turmoil happening in this world was brought by the blind love of the Light Goddess-sama huh.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026choose your words a bit more!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>But there was conflict in the heart of the Light Goddess.</p><br/><p>Love and hatred to the point of separating herself in two.</p><br/><p>This event raised the world in a crooked way.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the plan of the evil Light Goddess is closing to its completion.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan said with a stern face.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe turned her back on this world that had things she didn\u2019t want and is trying to create a new world. The personification of those feelings is Lucifer itself.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning that that giant snake will become a world in itself? I think I have heard a story about the world being inside a giant coiled snake.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to create a world, there\u2019s the need to gather all six elements. It has already assimilated the Demon Lords and obtained four elements. If we think about the light elements that was already present, then there\u2019s only one left\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dark element-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>If it can assimilate that one, Lucifer will be completed as a new world.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas there worth in us coming here?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy coming here, we were able to see the memories of the Light Goddess and we were able to learn about the enemy\u2019s objective and identity. Well, it wasn\u2019t pointless.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that be all it was-dasu?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be helped that we would question it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe enemy is massive-de gozaru. A weakness to defeat the opponent, a useful new power; wasn\u2019t there something else-de gozaru ka?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Let\u2019s explore the Underworld Country a bit more and search for something that can serve as a hint\u2014\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I said.</p><br/><p>The gazes of the four gather on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else we can gain here. This is plenty enough. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe learned about the meaning behind this battle. What we have to win with this battle. What else would be needed aside from that?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>A reason we must not lose.</p><br/><p>As long as we know that, we definitely won\u2019t lose!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026True.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If we take too much time, Haine-chi won\u2019t last after all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe be returning with a sharpened knife-dasu! Our batteries be charged to the max-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will fulfill our duties as heroes now!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>The reason why the Goddess showed us her memories here was because she entrusted us with the battle.</p><br/><p>Because she believed that we would be able to protect this world ourselves.</p><br/><p>We will answer that trust and fight to protect this world.</p><br/><p>That is our duty as the ones living in this world!</p><br/><p>******</p><br/><p>\u201cThose girls are coming back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With resolve in hand, I -Yorishiro, the Light Goddess- could be said to be the very culprit behind this time\u2019s calamity.</p><br/><p>Being divided in two because of a variety of conflicts, I became the good Inflation.</p><br/><p>And the evil Inflation incarnated as Sunnysol Ates.</p><br/><p>And now, Ates herself is the worst calamity attacking this world.</p><br/><p>Since the genesis of the world, I have been protecting the humans in place of the Dark God, and watched over the progress of the humans. That\u2019s what I intended.</p><br/><p>But even I might have been a harmful existence for the humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are pretty discouraged there, Yorishiro-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Light Founder\u2019s room where I should be the only one in, a new stream-like voice reverberated.</p><br/><p>After that, mist gathered, and a fishman dressed like a pierrot appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoacervate. Even when distilled, you still have the hobby of trespassing?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>In the past, this Water God that couldn\u2019t be described as anything but trash, had completely sanctified after his battle with the humans.</p><br/><p>Right now, he is using the water demon\u2014no, the water saint Mephistopheles to move around in the surface world.</p><br/><p>He is apparently moving around here and there doing good deeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have done quite the big move there. Showing the humans a memory of the genesis era.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is something necessary for those girls.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Why this calamity has occurred, why they have to fight against it; by knowing that, the resolve they will hold will be different.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if it is those girls that have learned the meaning of the fight, they will definitely be able to defeat the other me.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the sake of that, you even showed them a recreation of the information you managed to obtain from your other self.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>So he noticed huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not as if you were crossing your arms doing nothing. Since the moment you learned of Ates\u2019 identity, you spend a lot of time sending your consciousness to the spirit world and investigating your past half, right?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The latter part that I told Karen-san and the others was information that I managed to draw out from the memories of Ates-san.</p><br/><p>But it is not as if it all went smoothly.</p><br/><p>Especially her final objective. I only learned of it when she had already been caught whole into the Black Hole together with Haine-san.</p><br/><p>If I had learned of it sooner, I would have stopped the Demon Lords that were heading to battle\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes is already an enemy of this whole world. The job of stopping that is fitting for the heroes.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, it might have been a bit roundabout, but I had them go through the trouble of going all the way to the Underworld Country in order to, not only hear, but see and feel it themselves the path the world had taken.</p><br/><p>They are shouldering the world as they fight, so they have the right to know everything about the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, are you saying you will be putting this battle in the hands of the humans?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>The tone of Coacervate sounded cautious.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I came here as the representative of the four Base Elements. Nova-san can\u2019t move freely in Muspelheim, Mantle-san is scared of speaking face to face with you, and Quasar-san has his duties as the Wind Founder.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, since you are a free spirit, you are representing them?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe Gods also bear responsibility in this fight.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>The already clean Water God speaks clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we not limit ourselves to support and actually move to fight personally? If protecting the humans is the duty of us Gods\u2026\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect a day would come where I would hear those words coming out from you four Base Elements.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Those words that I wouldn\u2019t ever hear 1,600 years ago.</p><br/><p>Who was it that changed you people?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to even think of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we will provide our full support by having Karen-san and the others transform in their God Hero form to fight against Lucifer. We will pour all our strength, and we will take over all the burden. But\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The ones who will be acting will be them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis world is already the world of humans. Protecting this world is the duty of the ones that live in it.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Just like how he believed in the humans, I will also believe in them.</p><br/><p>The strong and kind humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey will definitely manage to do it. And when they actually manage to do it\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The humans will finally not need Gods anymore.</p><ul><li>398: Armageddon</li></ul><br/><p>We have returned.</p><br/><p>To this place that will become a battlefield.</p><br/><p>At this place that\u2019s dozens of kilometers away from Apollon City, this level ground that hasn\u2019t been developed and has no villages, there\u2019s the Great Demon Lord Lucifer restraint inside the Black Hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Lucifer?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The five heroes returned from the Underworld Country.</p><br/><p>They have finished their preparations for battle, and were lined up in front of the half-snake giant that will be their opponent.</p><br/><p>Just that\u2026that half-snake giant is\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt be so strange that it enters the level of disgusting-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Not even the Black Hole was able to swallow it whole, and the long snake body was sticking out from the black hole.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, it is disgusting.</p><br/><p>\u201cUeh\u2026 My stomach is turning just from looking at it.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 Maybe it can make a good meal-de gozaru.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cStop\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>That will be our opponent this time huh\u2026</p><br/><p>*Crack*</p><br/><p>The sound of something breaking reverberated.</p><br/><p>It was like the sound of a chick trying to break out from its shell.</p><br/><p>And then, soon after, a bigger shockwave was created as the Black Hole broke.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaaaa!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremendous gale raged, and it took our all just to stand ground.</p><br/><p>And then, the true repulsiveness appeared in front of us.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026Lucifer?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>A giant half-snake monster with five pair of wings.</p><br/><p>The upper half is that of a robust man, its lower half is that of a snake. Its face is also snake-like, and has reptilian eyes as well as a mouth split all the way to its ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t feel a single shred of intelligence from it-de gozaru na!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be an insult to put that thing in the same category as Gabriel and the other Demon Lords!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Before coming here, we heard about it from the explanation of someone.</p><br/><p>Lucifer is the perfected tool of a monster created by the wicked Light Goddess.</p><br/><p>It is different in a fundamental level from the four Demon Lords that obtained a heart after the culmination of several generations.</p><br/><p>On top of that, the ten wings at its back.</p><br/><p>They come in a set of two, and they have a different design respectively.</p><br/><p>Light, wind, earth, water, and fire wings.</p><br/><p>Aside from the light wings, all the others were stolen from the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? And here I was wondering who it was.\u201d</p><br/><p>From high up, there was a condescending voice sounding out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first ones to welcome me after coming out of the Black Hole are you people huh. Powerless humans on the same level as worms.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bewitching woman was standing at the top of Lucifer.</p><br/><p>Sunnysol Ates; the incarnation of the wicked Light Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the Demon Lords defeated, the ones used as their remaining hope was you people huh. How pitiful. Being forced to face an opponent that you know you can\u2019t hope to win against. There\u2019s no torture as big as this.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates says whatever she wants.</p><br/><p>She is not even seeing us as enemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy time is way too important to waste on you worms. If you throw away your pride and prostrate, I will allow you to run away from here. If you do that, you will be able to prolong for a bit your life till the moment I destroy the world, you know?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The first one to roar was Mirack-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur jobs as heroes is to protect the world! We will never show our backs to someone like you who wants to destroy it all!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you look too up, you will trip, you know?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan joins in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe intelligent Gods acknowledged our strength, but you seem to be an idiotic God. You will definitely begin spewing words like \u2018if only I hadn\u2019t underestimated them, I wouldn\u2019t have lost\u2019 like a total loser.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cCut-dasu! I be cutting like crazy-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe five will absolutely fulfill our duties as heroes!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan and Hyue-chan were also overflowing with fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>But Ates still held her stance like a queen with Lucifer as her puppet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiots who can\u2019t understand their own situation are truly comical. How unsightly.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>She was thoroughly looking down on us.</p><br/><p>\u201cLucifer is already on a plane that mere humans can\u2019t do anything about. I obviously also know about God Heroes. But with just receiving a slight boost of God power, you have no way of doing anything against Lucifer who is about to become a new world.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>The half-snake giant pushed forward its clenched fist.</p><br/><p>?!</p><br/><p>That fist is holding something\u2026</p><br/><p>A person\u2026</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I am happy that Haine-san, who had fallen into the Black Hole together with Lucifer to restrain it, has safely come back, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUuh\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It looks like he has received damage from it.</p><br/><p>He was only groaning in pain within the hand of Lucifer and can\u2019t even move his body to try and escape from its grasp.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of Haine-san, even when he fell into the Black Hole with the body of a human, he was still able to come back with his whole body, but\u2026but he has finally fallen into my hands.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates made an intoxicated face.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>\u201cFinally, he is within my hands. I won\u2019t let you go ever again. You are mine and only mine.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t even time to raise a scream.</p><br/><p>The hand holding Haine-san was quickly moved to the mouth of Lucifer, and he was swallowed with a gulp.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san! Haine-saaan!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way my scream would reach him.</p><br/><p>And soon, a change occurred.</p><br/><p>New wings appeared from the back of Lucifer.</p><br/><p>Pitch black wings, darker than any black in this world.</p><br/><p>With this, six pair of wings have been gathered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahahahahaha!! Finally! Finally Lucifer has been completed! Hahahahahahaha!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates laughs as if she had gone mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, all the pieces have fallen in place, and the puzzle has been completed! What\u2019s left is to destroy this meddlesome world, and Lucifer will become the new world!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>We already weren\u2019t even reflected in Ates\u2019 eyes anymore.</p><br/><p>She has already achieved her objective.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait for us, Haine-san!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I shout words that can\u2019t reach out to the ears of the person.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will definitely save you, Haine-san!! I will definitely save you from that monster along with the Demon Lords!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Just endure for a bit more. Please wait for us!!</p><br/><p>Ates\u2019 objective has been achieved. But our fight has begun now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, everyone!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d \u201cRoger~!\u201d \u201cYes-dasu!\u201d \u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone together\u2026!!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c[God Hero mode, activate!]\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-395-396-confrontation-of-good-and-evil\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 395-396 - Confrontation of good and evil\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-399-400-two-sides-unite\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 399-400 - Two sides unite\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236406\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

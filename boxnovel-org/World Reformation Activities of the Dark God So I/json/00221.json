I wasn\u2019t sure if to put it as a comment or a TLN, but since this has to do with translations, I decided this was a proper place to point this out.</p><br/><p>Today, I went to the movies to watch Fate/Stay Night Heaven\u2019s feels. I was excited to the extreme at the prospect of having the chance to watch this movie in actual theaters.</p><br/><p>But what I got was something I was already expecting \u2014-BAD translations.</p><br/><p>I knew I was going to get into that when I went to the movies, since anime movies are still not considered as actual cinema. And the quality of translation would drop to follow suit to that lack of interest.</p><br/><p>BUT the translations here were SO BAD I had to write about this.</p><br/><p>For example; the part where Illyasviel attacks Saber with Berserker, she shouts an order to Berserker (according to translation of the movie): \u201cSaber has high regenerative powers, so rape her and then cut off her head!\u201d Like WHAT, that\u2019s not what she said!This is what she said: \u2018Saber has high regenerative powers, so cut off her head and destroy her body!\u201d which OBVIOUSLY makes more sense.</p><br/><p>But the damage was made. All my friends though this was a rapy movie, and most likely, everyone in the movie was swept into that tone. Meaning that, in what comes ahead of the movie, they will be expecting those kind of dirty themes and begin seeing the movie in a light that isn\u2019t actually there.</p><br/><p>I love the Fate/Stay Night series, and as a fan, a translator, and somewhat of a writer, all this clicked me in the wrong way. There were many other translation misses and so many other changes in tone, it butchered my enjoyment and made me seriously think about this issue.</p><br/><p>Well, sorry for the long rant guys. I really wanted to point this one out. And if you are going to watch an anime movie, be really careful. Subtitles are not to be trusted in movies. I have more trust in fan translated things than actual movie translations, which is a sad reality.</p><hr/><br/><p>But more than that, what worried me more was the behaviour of Karen-san.</p><br/><p>What was that cold rejection towards the knights just now?</p><br/><p>That is something incredibly unthinkable from the Karen-san I know.</p><br/><p>I was so bothered by the unsuitable attitude of Karen-san that I felt I had to keep my dealing with Ates to a reasonable extent and chase after Karen-san.</p><br/><p>I slip through the light knight corps\u2019 practice location and head towards the place where Karen-san left to. Inside a forest that is outside from the area of the Light Grand Church, there was an open space that even felt out of place.</p><br/><p>This place is the long-distance sniping space that was specially made for the wind hero Hyue.</p><br/><p>At the time when Hyue came to visit, this is what was made; a place that no one uses since the time Hyue returned to Rudras Metropolis\u2026is how it should have been, but\u2026..at that place, Karen-san had unsheathed her holy sword and brandished it directly at the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026[Holy Light Bisection]\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>A dazzling light was released from the blade, and the light sword slowly become bigger, longer.</p><br/><p>It was a completely different technique from the long \u2018Holy Light Line\u2019 that is released as a distance attack. Making the holy sword\u2019s blade itself grow bigger with the light divine power is the new ultimate technique of Karen-san; the \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The light blade that had been gigantified became small specs of light and disperse.</p><br/><p>When that happens, the big light sword will obviously lose its volume and become smaller.</p><br/><p>In reality, the big light sword of Karen-san can only increase by a limit and completely stops growing anymore from that.</p><br/><p>\u201cGunuuuuu!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>But even with that, from what I see in Karen-san\u2019s expression, she is still trying to put in more power in order to make it bigger, but in reality, it isn\u2019t following her wishes.</p><br/><p>At Rudras Metropolis, she had sliced the giant slime in two with a single stroke from that technique\u2026but at that time, it wasn\u2019t a technique that Karen-san managed to do alone\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah, Haine-san.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>She must have given up for now.</p><br/><p>She dispersed all the light blade that came out from the holy sword and returned to simply being a sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have shown you an embarrassing sight. \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019 is still not in a territory that can be called completed.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>At the time in Rudras Metropolis, she managed to maintain that giant light blade, but the reason for that was not the achievement of Karen-san only, but because of the cooperation of one other person. That person is Sunnysol Ates who had lent her power to succeed in the making of the \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease and convergence; utilizing these two originally opposing concepts at the same time, moreover, it has to be at the best of its capabilities, or the \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019 won\u2019t succeed. In Rudras Metropolis, I managed the release, while Ates-sama dealt with the convergence. By dividing the work, we managed to form the giant light sword.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san says this with a pained expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not good! I have to learn how to do \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019 by myself without requiring the help of such a person!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s the reason for today\u2019s training huh.</p><br/><p>It is true that Karen-san is blessed with talent, but she definitely isn\u2019t only described with just that. She is always unable to be satisfied with the current state and puts effort in climbing up to the next step.</p><br/><p>But today, that looked way too painful.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to blame yourself that much. From what I see, it doesn\u2019t look like a problem that can be resolved in one go, so how about taking your time in progressing?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The reason why I followed-up by saying this was because it was clear to my eyes that Karen-san was hurrying.</p><br/><p>It is because she was so in a hurry that she neglected her answers on the knights and ended up giving a cold impression.</p><br/><p>Taking out the impatience in her heart is also part of my duty.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no good!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san rejected it a lot more fervently than I thought.</p><br/><p>As I thought, she is acting weird. She is losing her usual self.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to\u2026I have to become stronger no matter what! Complete \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019 and also increase the power of my other abilities! But that\u2019s just not enough at all.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to defeat those Demon Lords\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>Karen-san and the others have already met them.</p><br/><p>They are the strongest of existences that can\u2019t even be compared to any of the monsters until now.</p><br/><p>The Wind Demon Lord Raphael; Earth Demon Lord Uriel; Water Demon Lord Gabriel; Fire Demon Lord Michael; the power of the four Demon Lords surpassed by far what we expected.</p><br/><p>A single Demon Lord would probably easily defeat all the heroes, and the proof of that is the fact that, with a single glare, the movements of Karen-san and the others were completely sealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are heroes! We have to fight those Demon Lords and come out victorious. In order to do that, I have to become more more more more!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>So she needs power huh.</p><br/><p>It is not only Karen-san. Mirack, Celestis, Sasae-chan, Hyue; all the current heroes have felt the difference in the wall that stands before them and they are apparently all training in their own cities \u2014with the previous heroes as partners.</p><br/><p>Mirack and Celestis, who habitually came here to hang out when they found the time, have not shown themselves lately because of that reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san acting strange lately wasn\u2019t only because of Ates alone.</p><br/><p>In the face of these giant and powerful enemies that are the Demon Lords, it can\u2019t be helped that she would end up stiffening her body.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Training by yourself will not be good enough, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It would be easy to untie the permeating danger of Ates and maintain the support of the knights, however, what has to be done for Karen-san who is trying to face the threat of the Demon Lords on her own is another completely different thing.</p><br/><p>An act of kindness.</p><br/><p>If Karen-san is going to valiantly stand to face that threat, I will also stand by the side of Karen-san and advance together with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be your training partner.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Uhm, but\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It looks like Karen-san was terribly flustered by these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine. Just think of me as a Demon Lord and attack me with all you have! It might even relief stress. Two birds with one stone, don\u2019t you think?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then\u2026[Holy Light Blade]!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>A light slash is released from Karen-san\u2019s holy sword.</p><br/><p>It was one attack, however, I have my invincible dark matter\u2014ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cBuaaaaagh~~!!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Being hit by the light blade, I was send flying.</p><br/><p>Right, I completely forgot.</p><br/><p>The only weakness of my dark matter; it is completely powerless against light divine power.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I asked if it was okay! Haine-san, are you okay?! Haine-san? Haine-saaaaann!!\u201d (Karen) &lt;Snaaaake!&gt;</p><br/><p>I am alive, but I was blown faraway by that light divine power.</p><br/><p>How pathetic.</p><br/><p>To think that I, as the assistant of Karen-san, am not even able to serve as a practice partner for her.</p><ul><li>222: Home Visit</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cAaah! How pathetic!!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, after that, I passed my time watching the training of Karen-san from the side.</p><br/><p>Even when I have the darkness power that\u2019s supposedly the strongest of all, I can\u2019t even give advice to Karen-san in how to grow that light power of hers.</p><br/><p>I also finished my duties for the day and returned.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The place I am currently residing at in Apollon City is at the public housing area that is under the direct management of the Light Church.</p><br/><p>I was lent one of the rooms and was living alone.</p><br/><p>I opened it with my key and enter the room.</p><br/><p>When I turn on the ethereal-powered lights, the night became bright like morning.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It is night, but I am not hungry yet.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s take a bath first and get refreshed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFill up the bathtub and\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Since coming to the big city, I have been surprised by a number of things, but one of those is that when I turn the faucet, warm water comes out on its own.</p><br/><p>In the time I was at my village, we would have to go to the well, or do a round trip to the river in order to fill up the bathtub.</p><br/><p>Maintained sewers, pumps that one can draw water from in the residential areas, machines that heat up the water; everything has been made possible thanks to ethereal, and they move due to ethereal.</p><br/><p>What a splendid civilization.</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, since coming to Apollon City, I have still found time to go back to my village once every month, but one day, I want mother and father to come here and sightsee the city or something.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the hot water has been filled up.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I take off my clothes and enter the bathroom. After washing off the dust at the shower, I enter the bathtub.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh~~~.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I let out a voice cause of the pleasing sensation.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026It may sound peaceful at a glance, however, the future prospects are pretty grim.</p><br/><p>The battle against the Demon Lords that will be approaching, Ates who is slowly increasing her sympathizers inside the Light Church; internal falling must be used to refer to this.</p><br/><p>The problem of the Demon Lords is especially serious.</p><br/><p>The reformation of the churches is advancing fast and we are in the middle of removing the useless things and increasing the important fighting forces, but even with that, I really can\u2019t imagine being able to do something about those Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>In terms of the individual strength of the heroes, for example; even if Karen-san were to perfect her \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019, what will occur? Uriel who was acting as the core of the giant Slime had stopped the \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019 of Karen-san and Ates with only his pinky finger.</p><br/><p>The difference is way too wide.</p><br/><p>No matter what kind of countermeasures we take, I don\u2019t feel like that difference can be filled.</p><br/><p>And what would happen if the heroes\u2026the humans can\u2019t defeat the Demon Lords? The objective they have of \u2018eradicating humans\u2019 will be accomplished. That\u2019s what will happen.</p><br/><p>The heroes, who are the ones that have actually encountered the Demon Lords, are probably the only ones who have felt this truth, this future, and are growing impatient.</p><br/><p>Ending up contrasting from the many people that are in joy for the sense of release of this reformation is something that can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t find an end to my thoughts as I sink myself in the bathtub.</p><br/><p>Demon Lords; this abnormal factors that have surpassed the structure of us Gods.</p><br/><p>Monsters, in a sense, could be considered the villains that the Gods created in order to increase the faith of humans towards Gods, and because of that, their natural instinct is to attack humans.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, even if they attack humans, they wouldn\u2019t eradicate humans. If they were to do that, the Gods themselves who prepared the monsters wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain faith and it would trouble them.</p><br/><p>And yet, the Demon Lords hold the objective of \u2018eradicating humanity\u2019.</p><br/><p>That would mean monsters have escaped from the strings of Gods.</p><br/><p>It would mean that they obtained a will as living beings.</p><br/><p>For a God, the evolution of a living being -no matter if it is not human- is something worth celebrating, but if what comes as a result of that is a battle for supremacy against humans, I can\u2019t just silently ignore it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the first place, my objective was to eliminate the monsters, but that was because they were simply the puppets of the Gods without heart or soul -pseudo living beings- so I had no hesitation. So this is a troubling point on its own.</p><br/><p>Leaving that aside, the current problem is that if we want to win against the Demon Lords, the most direct approach would be for me to personally act.</p><br/><p>No matter how big of an opponent it is, as long as they are within the boundaries of the four basic elements, they can\u2019t be opponents of I -the Dark God.</p><br/><p>The other day when we faced the four Demon Lords, I didn\u2019t feel like I would lose.</p><br/><p>But the problems is that they also knew that. And by accepting that truth, they planned around it. That is an incredibly big problem.</p><br/><p>What the monsters we encountered until now didn\u2019t have; intelligence.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lords having that will make the fights from now on really hard.</p><br/><p>As long as they know that they can\u2019t win upfront, the Demon Lords will definitely not appear before me. They will stay hidden in this wide world, and will keep their presence low until a decisive moment arrives.</p><br/><p>In reality, I should have left the Light capital immediately and left for a journey to subjugate them, but finding those hidden guys in that way would be next to impossible. On the contrary, if the Demon Lords were to attack the cities in the opening where I am not there, that in itself would be terrible.</p><br/><p>And so, it is currently in a mortifying situation where staying in the city is currently the best option.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The hot water has turned lukewarm while I was thinking.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Looks like I have been thinking for long.</p><br/><p>Well then, let\u2019s leave the bath and do some preparations for dinner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, are you already done?\u201d</p><br/><p>When suddenly, a voice sounded, making my heart jump.</p><br/><p>\u201cUooaah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Why?!</p><br/><p>This should be my personal room! There shouldn\u2019t be anyone else aside from me!</p><br/><p>But a voice actually sounded! It wasn\u2019t my imagination!</p><br/><p>Scary!</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t told at all that this was a haunted room! Is this the type of room that when you take off the wallpapers you will find uncountable hand blood-prints all over the place?!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease calm down, it is me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is Ates.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>By the time I noticed, beside the bathtub, there was a woman brimming with allure that was covered with only a bath towel.</p><br/><p>That woman was, without doubt, Sunnysol Ates.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to meet you, so I have infiltrated here.\u201d (Ates)</p><ul><li>223: Crawling into the bath</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>At my room, in my bath.</p><br/><p>The one who appeared in there as if natural was Sunnysol Ates. I send her sharp words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, this is the bath, so it is a matter of course to be naked.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Is what Ates said as she fixes the bath towel that was barely covering her body. Just that, I could see for a second what was hidden behind that bath towel. Or more like, I felt like it was an intentional provocation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant with that question. Or more like, how did you turn around the question into that?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>What I want to hear is the reason as to why you are invading my room without prior appointment.</p><br/><p>And her objective behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to hear it? Then, first, can you please let me in the bathtub?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause if I leave naked like this without entering the warm water, I will freeze so much I would catch a cold. Let\u2019s have a nice long talk as we enjoy the warm water together.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it fine to just talk after I leave the bathtub?!</p><br/><p>But that stupid Ates seems like she didn\u2019t intend to hear my answer from the very beginning, and had plunged those lustrous legs into the bathtub!</p><br/><p>First one leg, then the other!</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Wait! This is a room for one! And the bathtub was made with that in consideration, so the size is for one as well! There\u2019s no way two people can enter at the same time\u2014and she is not listening at all! Stop it! This is too cramped! Many soft things are hitting!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with this aggressive woman!</p><br/><p>In just a short moment, the bathtub for one was stuffed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh~, as I thought, having company in the bath is nice.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Ates takes out a cloth-like thing from inside the bathtub and throws it away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment! What did you throw away just now?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bath towel. Having a bath towel on inside the bathtub would be a lack of etiquette.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than etiquette, you should be worrying about trespassing private property!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u2018The problem would be resolved if you just leave the bathtub, right?\u2019, is what I felt a voice was telling me.</p><br/><p>But I want you to think about this.</p><br/><p>The moment I leave the bathtub, the woman in front of me would inevitably be facing straight at something unsightly and things would get unsightly.</p><br/><p>And so, I can\u2019t move!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuromiya Haine-san, I wanted to speak with you alone.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe secret weapon that the Light Church possesses. The user of a mysterious power that doesn\u2019t relate to Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, or Light; and boasts invincible power. The many giant monsters that have been defeated until now, in every instance that this happened in the five Grand Churches, you were present.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What are you talking about?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>For now, I try to feign ignorance.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san playing an active role as a hero and Yorishiro-sama\u2019s status as a Founder growing rockfirm were also because you supported them from the shadows. And so, I have something to consult you about.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates continues.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you change from them to me?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>In a sense, they were words I expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would come out of doing that?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI would say, the situation would be slightly better than now. Haine-san, in the times when a group of thousands to millions are going to fight, what do you think is the thing that is needed the most?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to play riddles, do that elsewhere.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Answering questions itself is jumping into the pace of the other party.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a cold person. Well then, allow me to answer. An excelling leader.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said, I have no intentions of listening to what you have to say.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Light Church that has expanded to the level of a nation; the Aurora Knight corps that are a portion of it also possess quite the size. Leading that group perfectly without losing order. The amount of people that possess the commanding ability for that are limited.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san and Yorishiro have plenty enough ability for that.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I felt like there would be no end, so I begin the dialogue.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut by placing a person with higher ability into the proper position, don\u2019t you think that a bigger effect will be obtained?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cNO.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I continue adding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about the confusion that will occur with the change, it would become quite the demerit. As long as the level is enough, it would be better to have the people already there to do it.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra ara, you have got quite the discernment.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>But what\u2019s with this?</p><br/><p>When I am speaking with this woman, I feel an inexplicable churning sensation.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Haine-san, the people in the past said this: \u2018Humans have a good heart when they are born\u2019.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the other hand, different people from the past said this: \u2018Humans are born with an evil heart\u2019. The humans that are just born only have desires and instincts, making them the same as beasts. They said that: \u2018By living together with others, they learn morals and reason and become proper human beings\u2019.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it you are trying to go with this?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, which do you think it is? Is the true nature of humans good or evil? Is what we obtain as we grow up\u2026the good or the evil?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>When she finished talking about such weird things, Ates stood up from the bathtub.</p><br/><p>What was hidden in the water had now been fully exposed right in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOOOIIIII!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped then. If Haine-san doesn\u2019t want to ride on my plan, I will have to create a situation where you will have no choice but to ride on it.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cCreate a situation, you say?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cA man and woman passing the night in the same room. How will it look to the eyes of the surroundings? In this occasion, it doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s inside the box. By simply creating one established fact, the rest of the facts will create itself; a crafted fact that you and I became one.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Scary! As I thought, this woman is scary!!</p><br/><p>No matter how I answer, this woman already had her plan succeed the moment she had infiltrated my room?!</p><br/><p>Then why did you attack me more than that?! Or more like, that well-shaped body of hers was steadily approaching me!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d (???)</p><br/><p>Wa?!!</p><br/><p>In this room that I thought was my sole haven, Ates had appeared, and now, there\u2019s a new voice resonating in the room?!</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>By the time I noticed, Karen-san was standing at the entrance of the bath!</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, what\u2019s the matter, Karen-san? This is the room of Haine-san. Entering his room without prior notice is considered trespassing, you know?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless of you to say!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was about to protest to a variety of things here, but a single glare of Karen-san stopped me from saying anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes-sama\u2026please don\u2019t underestimate me so much. I knew that you would be perpetrating something.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>And one more voice?!</p><br/><p>That one is Yorishiro! Even Yorishiro appeared?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always eyes on you. We received a report that you had infiltrated into Haine-san\u2019s room secretly and we have hurriedly come here.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>I see, you have saved me! Ah but, for some reason, the offensive of Ates doesn\u2019t stop?!</p><br/><p>She is pressing me onto the bottom of the bathtub!</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a lot of things sticking onto me!!</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes-sama! How long are you planning on sticking onto Haine-san?! We have caught you red handed, so separate from him already!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I have to do that?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cArrgh!!\u201d\u201d, she began to pull and I to push, but to no avail.</p><br/><p>This woman is strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it has come to this, how about you two watch from there? The moment when Haine-san and I enter a more carnal relationship. It will simply change deceit to actual truth.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Uwaaaaa?! So soft!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Please get away, Ates-sama! Kugh, what should I do?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it has come to this, there\u2019s no choice, Karen-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama?! What is it that we have no choice but to do?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I am a 100% sure it is nothing decent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t stop Ates-san, we also have to rush. In other words, we will also be attacking Haine-san here!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeeeeehh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without room for discussion, Yorishiro immediately takes off her clothes and invaded the bathtub.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Yorishiro-sama?! Rushing in without a single moment of hesitation! \u2026No, that\u2019s not good! I am so embarrassed I can\u2019t do something like that! \u2026But Ates-sama and Yorishiro-sama will be doing such things to Haine-san! Aaaaahh!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san bellows as if she had awakened.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe as well!!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san also took off what she was wearing and rushed into the bathtub!</p><br/><p>No, wait! Didn\u2019t I say that this bathtub was made for one person?!</p><br/><p>If we were to add a total of four people in here, it would obviously get incredibly tight! I who was the first to enter it would of course be at the deepest area of it, and because it is a bathtub, there\u2019s obviously water in it, you know?!</p><br/><p>My head is sunk down into the water and\u2026this is bad, I can\u2019t breath!!</p><br/><p>\u201c*Gurgle**Gurgle**Gurgle**Gurgle*!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Moreover, most of my body is being pressed by soft things, and I can\u2019t struggle even if I wanted to.</p><br/><p>What is with this trial?!</p><br/><p>As I was being crushed by the accumulation of hopes and dreams, my consciousness grew dim inside the depths of the bathtub\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><ul><li>224: Wicked Woman\u2019s Deep Affection</li></ul><br/><p>Dangerous.</p><br/><p>I thought I would die.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cI am sorry!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of me, there were a total of three beauties doing seiza in front of me.</p><br/><p>Of course, they are wearing clothes.</p><br/><p>I was crushed by the beauties inside the bathtub, but my survival instincts kicked in when it felt that my life was in danger. With the repulsion effect of the dark matter I created, I pushed out the three and I somehow managed to surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, Yorishiro.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>First of all, these two.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am grateful that you came to save me, but the way you dealt with it was out of the question. What are you trying to pull by joining the perpetrator in crushing me to death?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have reflected on it!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cMy sense of rivalry burned!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>They themselves must have noticed that they overdid it.</p><br/><p>They were unexpectedly obedient.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Ates!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t mind me.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>This is the person that should be reflecting the most, and yet, she is not reflecting at all!!</p><br/><p>This evil woman! This evil woman to the core!!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so angry. Isn\u2019t it actually a happy happening for Haine-san?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYorishiro-sama, Karen-san, and I; the strongest women in the Light Church have come at you to tie the deal, you know? Any man would wish for a situation like that.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOr were you not happy? Even though you embraced Yorishiro-sama and Karen-san?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Deep emotional gazes were piercing me from both sides.</p><br/><p>Karen-san and Yorishiro were staring daggers at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying you are not happy? Meaning that you hate those two? Must be. No matter how beautiful you are, you wouldn\u2019t even want to touch the hands of someone that you hate after all.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>This woman! How underhanded!</p><br/><p>Narrowing my choices in this way, she is trying to make me choose the answers that she wishes for.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is true that I was happy\u2026maybe?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that means you like me as well.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did it come to that?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Misconstruction, inflating the issue, changing the main point of the matter; this is one really fearsome woman!!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have understood it now with this, Haine-san. This woman is truly fearsome.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Is the statement of Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>Ates had already stopped doing the seiza and had taken a sit at one of the chairs in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cA political power hungry person like you, now that you have returned to the political stage, I had predicted that you would aim to increase your fighting forces, but to think you were aiming to recruit Haine-san, moreover, utilizing seduction.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cFinding the vitals and attacking them with precision is a basic of strategy. Don\u2019t you think a first-rate woman is fitting for the strongest man?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t joke around!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Maybe she reacted to those words, Karen-san stands up along with her shout.</p><br/><p>Her legs were wobbling most likely because she was in seiza just a few moments ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, you are that kind of person! I understood it since the moment I saw you. You are the kind of person that likes to steal away the things that other people treasure! You are the worst. Please don\u2019t get close to Haine-san ever again!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufu, what a funny girl.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates giggles as if saying she was truly amused by this</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we have a connection of being the current and previous hero, we are basically strangers. I only learned about you being selected as the hero after I had been driven out of the Church. And yet, you hated me this much. I really was wondering why. Ufufu.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates continues laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you saw through my true nature with that so called woman instinct, and thus, noticed that I was dangerous. As a woman myself, this is interesting, truly interesting. You possess some truly deep emotions as a hero, and as a woman.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>The gaze that was directed at Karen-san had changed directions to Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have found a nice girl, Yorishiro.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cYour tone of voice has returned to how it was in the past, lady.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>For some reason, the two speak in a tone that they hadn\u2019t used before.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>As if throwing that question far away, Karen-san declares this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes-sama, I won\u2019t acknowledge you as my senior! Leaving aside the other previous heroes, you alone are not a predecessor that is worthy of respect!! I will show you that I can surely defeat the Demon Lords even without your help!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. Do as you wish. It might just happen that, by the time you notice, everything you have has all moved to be mine though.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Sparks fly around.</p><br/><p>Of all places, it had to be in my room.</p><br/><p>\u201cI challenge you!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san declares.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce more, this time, a fair and square match between you and me. A 1 on 1 battle! The one who loses will depart from the Light Church! How about that?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san, wait a moment!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>We finished the new and old heroes match not that long ago, and yet, you are risking injury again?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Compared to that, Ates had a mature response.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I go doing something that doesn\u2019t have any benefits for me? Obtaining the same result as the one that was already obtained at the old and new heroes match; to repeat a battle just for that sake, even if we think about the effects on the other churches, it would be unsightly.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it at that, Karen-san.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro stops Karen-san who was still trying to bite.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the kind of person she is. She won\u2019t get involved with fights that clearly define a black and white. If she were to get involved, it would be in order to paint something even bigger into a gray color. The new and old heroes match that happened before was exactly that.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Even in my eyes, it was exactly that.</p><br/><p>This woman won\u2019t ever challenge you head on.</p><br/><p>Even if she were right in front of her enemy, she would hide her presence, make a plan, wait for the moment, and will set it up so that the enemy will crumble on its own.</p><br/><p>And right now, her targets are us.</p><br/><p>Sunnysol Ates\u2019 peculiar fighting style of not swinging a weapon to battle might have already been brandished.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-218-220-one-unnecessary-person\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 218-220 - One unnecessary person\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-225-226-a-pleasant-talk-that-happens-only-once\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 225-226 - A pleasant talk that happens only once\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236337\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Fight monsters and protect the people.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what heroes are, and that\u2019s the hero\u2019s duty.</p><br/><p>And so, it has been close to a hundred years that the monsters have appeared, and has continued being that way. Of course, there\u2019s no way a single human would be able to continue on active duty for so long.</p><br/><p>In history, there have been many people who have received the title of hero from their predecessors and taken their place.</p><br/><p>And so, the current heroes are Karen-san, Mirack, Celestis, Sasae-chan, and Hyue.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s obviously going to be previous heroes that have fought just like them.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s the previous generation, they probably hold the same amount of power compared to the present active heroes.</p><br/><p>And so, the ones that are currently in front of us are exactly that, the previous generation heroes.</p><br/><p>The previous fire hero, Abi Kyouka.</p><br/><p>As expected of the senior of Mirack. Her body is well-formed and muscular, however, her gaze is a lot sharper than Mirack\u2019s, and it makes it even more likely to mistake for a man than Mirack.</p><br/><p>The water hero, Ra Sarasa.</p><br/><p>It looks like she got along well with the current hero, Celestis, and has an air of elegance and charm. The gesture of hiding her mouth with a folding fan made it feel like she had the refiness of a noble.</p><br/><p>Those two speak.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hm, the Light Church\u2019s headquarters huh. This is the first time I have stepped in it but, just as I thought, it stinks of mold.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a church whose only trait is its age. No matter if mold grows or spider webs appear, do they think that it is fine to just be old?\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>You were the ones who came raiding this place and you say that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that the fire hero would run into such a mold stinking hole like this, what is the meaning of this, Mirack?\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Uhm\u2026you see\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack has turned pale and is trembling?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? If you have something to say, say it without reservation.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cK-Kyouka-anesan! The era is progressing and we can\u2019t always be fighting each other!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spew out excuses!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cGuhoooh!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Unreasonable physical violence?!</p><br/><p>Mirack was kicked and send flying?!</p><br/><p>\u201cPathetic! This is pathetic, Mirack! You had quite the prospects even within my juniors, so I left you with being the successor, but it looks like I was completely mistaken. To think that you would forget about the duty of a hero and go into wagging your tail to others!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Wagging her tail.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have perpetrated the same offence, Celestis-san.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>This time it was the previous water hero that was reprimanding the current hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the beginning, there were voices of discontent in the church regarding you. They said that you dared to play being an idol, and that maybe you are neglecting your main job as hero. But you didn\u2019t stop at that, this time, you even tried holding hands with the enemy. How outrageous. Even the esteemed people of the church and I as well can\u2019t forgive this, you know?\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Tch, what a noisy gold-digger.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing at a~ll!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>From the conversation they had, I began seeing the issue here little by little.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It looks like it was the same for Karen-san. She jumped into the conversation as if she couldn\u2019t endure it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that you two are reprimanding Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan because of the Hero Alliance?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came here to crush this so called Hero Alliance.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The Hero Alliance where the five heroes will join strengths to fight against monsters.</p><br/><p>This was something impossible to think of with the common sense we have had until now. Because the heroes originally didn\u2019t get along with each other.</p><br/><p>In the past, the five Churches were stealing believers from each other, opposing each other, and there was even a time when they were at war.</p><br/><p>Because of the enemy of all humans -the monsters- appearing, it naturally ended and became hazy in that sense, but even with that, the view of the churches towards each other is still that of looking down and antagonizing. \u2018We are the superior church\u2019, \u2018the other four are lower than us\u2019.</p><br/><p>The previous heroes must have had that kind of thinking deeply edged in themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cA few days ago, a message came to me. This is what it was written. \u2018The current heroes have thrown away their pride and are trying to hold hands\u2019.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cA similar thing happened at my place as well. I was surprised when I received the notice. The junior that I believed and entrusted with the job, to think that she would do something akin to stepping on my good will.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The previous heroes said without hiding their anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat stupid friendship; there\u2019s no way I can overlook it as a former hero.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cI may have already retired, but I do feel a sense of duty and obligation towards my church. There\u2019s no way I can just not correct the mistake that my junior has made.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>So it really was about that huh.</p><br/><p>The reason why Mirack and Celestis said that the Hero Alliance might not be possible to form, that\u2019s because the previous heroes had heard from somewhere about the Hero Alliance, and were trying to revoke that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?! The Hero Alliance means that the heroes cooperate to fight against monsters! Rather than fighting alone, it is more efficient to fight by uniting all five of us and that will allow us to protect the people from monsters better! What about that is a mistake?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>For Karen-san, the Hero Alliance was a task that she placed her all to accomplish.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way she can stay calm after being denied that.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cOf course it is a mistake.\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>But the former heroes rejected that.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, you guys are mistaking what you should be prioritizing. What a hero should truly be protecting is the authority of the church. The Fire Church that Mirack and I are affiliated to is the most superior one in the world. The hero fights in order to prove that.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you mean to say \u2018the Water Church is the one that is the most superior in the world\u2019?\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Fierce sparks scatter even between Kyouka and Sarasa.</p><br/><p>Even if the objective they came here for is the same, these two are in no way friendly with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, the reason why you have to cooperate is because you are all weak. A true hero is strong. Because a hero is strong, they are able to protect the people even by themselves.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Trying to hide your own weakness with fancy words like \u2018cooperation\u2019, that in itself makes you a failure as a hero. As I thought, I will have you relinquish your title as hero right here and now.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Agitation ran through the current heroes as they heard those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack, relinquish your seat as hero. It looks like you weren\u2019t appropriate to be the hero.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou as well, Celestis-san. You should quickly return the title of hero that is way too heavy for you, and just go and play idol without the need of worrying about anything else.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The words of their seniors made the light in the eyes of Mirack and Celestis change. From the light of fear, it changed into hostility.</p><br/><p>However, this didn\u2019t apply only to those two.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that, Abi Kyouka-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>The previous fire hero looks at me.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the previous. She is already a person of the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I remember\u2026the reason why you retired from your post of hero was because you lost against the Fire Cow Phalaris, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>That is a story I heard when we went ourselves to subjugate that very Fire Cow Phalaris.</p><br/><p>The giant monster, Phalaris, that was exercising its authority in the vicinity of Muspelheim. Its power was mighty, and the Fire Church tried sending subjugation teams many times, but they all failed and were turned their tables on.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s true! I learned about my own powerlessness, so I relinquished my title as hero and left on a journey to strengthen myself. In order to one day defeat the Fire Cow and vindicate my honor.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cOhohohoho~~, what a pitiful weakling-san.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>This is something that I knew already, but the previous heroes are really in incredibly bad terms.</p><br/><p>But right now, there\u2019s a more important thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know? That Fire Cow Phalaris has been defeated.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones who defeated it were the ones there, Mirack and Karen-san.\u201d (Haine)</p><ul><li>177: Advocacy of the young</li></ul><br/><p>The Fire Cow Phalaris.</p><br/><p>The biggest monster currently known that was properly confirmed by the five churches.</p><br/><p>Its strength was also top class, and the Fire Church send subjugation teams several times, but they received a crushing defeat every time and escaped.</p><br/><p>But the threat of the Fire Cow is gone now.</p><br/><p>It has already been subjugated after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSubjugated by the hands of the fire hero, Mirack, and the light hero, Karen-san.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat stupid things are you saying?! There\u2019s no way these two weaklings would be able to defeat that monster!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the truth. The fire hero and the light hero <i>cooperated</i> and defeated the Fire Cow Phalaris that you couldn\u2019t defeat.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u2026And so.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you say it again? Who is stronger than who? Small fry hero-san that couldn\u2019t defeat the Fire Cow Phalaris \u2013no, the former small-fry hero-san? Or maybe hero small-fry-san is better?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cGununununu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought I might have said a bit too much there, but I didn\u2019t feel like loosening my hand here.</p><br/><p>This is the bond that Karen-san and the others have risked their life to create. And yet, people that are trapped in past conventions are trying to destroy this? There\u2019s only one option, fighting back with all we have.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyouka-anesan.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I was about to give my next attack, but Mirack interjected.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that we were the ones who defeated the Fire Cow Phalaris. There\u2019s definitely no way I would have been able to defeat it on my own. It is thanks to the cooperation of Karen and Haine there that we were able to defeat it.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack! You are still saying such bullshit?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd with that in mind, I want to say something. Times have changed. The heroes can\u2019t move only thinking about their own church anymore. Those kind of heroes are the ones that are a failure as heroes!\u201d( Mirack)</p><br/><p>As expected of the current hero. When she is not only trembling, she does have a sharp tongue. And that is obviously not something that only applies to Mirack.</p><br/><p>Celestis also stands up trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cFashionable resident of Hydra Ville, Sarasa-san. You also know as well, right? The incident with the Great Sea Dragon that occured recently. You married into a famous and noble mercantile family, so there\u2019s no way you would be estranged from information, right?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What about it?\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>She is talking about the giant water element monster that intruded on the Live of Celestis, the Great Sea Dragon, Hydra Serpent.</p><br/><p>That monster, that attacked because of the Water God Coacervate, had created a giant tsunami and was about to destroy the whole Water capital, but the ones who managed to save it in the nick of time were the light, fire, and water heroes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas a monster stronger than that Great Sea Dragon appeared in your active days? From what I remember, there\u2019s none~. That Great Sea Dragon as well, without the help of Karen-chi and Mirack-chi, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to defeat it. Are you saying you would be able to defeat that? On your own?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cUuh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf three heroes were not in that place at that time, Hydra Ville would have been destroyed by now. You and the house of your husband would have been swimming in the sea at this moment~. I will be saying this as well. The times have changed!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The feelings of the new era that the old ones wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>It looks like there\u2019s no need for me to say anything more. Karen-san seems to be calming down as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Cow Phalaris and the Great Sea Dragon, and also the four Mother Monsters. Since the time we were made heroes, for some reason, there have been monster calamities of the highest class. In order to deal with those and reduce the casualties of the people, the work of each hero on their own is by no means going to be enough.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>But before Karen-san fought the Fire Cow Phalaris and the Great Sea Dragon, there haven\u2019t been similar others of those class before.</p><br/><p>In other words, Kyouka and Sarasa finished their active days by only defeating the infinitely produced monsters of the Mother Monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are in no way holding hands to deceive our own weakness. It is in order to overcome the difficulties that we wouldn\u2019t we able to overcome otherwise. But that doesn\u2019t mean we are holding hands against our will. We, the current generation heroes, respect each other and love each other.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Kuh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The speech of Karen-san that couldn\u2019t be more straightforward than that was not letting Kyouka and Sarasa find any words to refute it.</p><br/><p>There was someone who came to my back and whispered to me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I was wondering what would happen for a moment there, but it looks like it will go well. As expected of Karen. She could say all that even against Kyouka-anesan.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who blew the horn to counterattack was Haine-chi though. These couple are seriously strong and invincible with their mouth and their fist.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a complete newbie\u2026and couldn\u2019t say anything at all\u2026\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Mirack, Celestis, and Hyue; you girls should also be showing sharpness here. They somehow managed to oppose them slightly by riding on the opportunity we created though.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you know, there\u2019s no more awkward existence for a hero than their predecessor. We have to show respect to them, and in essence, they are our superiors.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor me, on top of that, I am also her pupil. Since the time I joined, she has looked after me, and she thoroughly knows my weaknesses. I don\u2019t feel like I can win. It is truly a blessing that Karen and the others are here!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>For them, their predecessors are really a natural enemy huh.</p><br/><p>But in the end, that applies only when in the same church. Karen-san is steadily cornering the outside former heroes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have no other opinions, please take your leave. Leave the problems of the present world to the currently active heroes.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Looks like the match is over.</p><br/><p>When Mirack and Celestis came over crying, I was trembling in fear wondering what was the matter, but I am glad it ended up as a small problem.</p><br/><p>\u2026Is what I thought\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave it to you; you girls that just glance at illusory dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>A new voice resounded in the parlor room.</p><br/><p>A voice I don\u2019t know at all, and a person I have seen for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You are\u2014?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san was stiffened at the arrival of this new person, as if she had met her nemesis.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong time no see, Karen-san. I am originally not in a standing that would have me step into the Light Grand Church anymore, but due to the amount of uneasiness you as the successor give to me, I had no choice but to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>The new person that appeared\u2026is a blond short-cut haired woman. Her age seems to be similar to that of Kyouka and Sarasa, moreover, her atmosphere feels somewhat similar to that of Karen-san. Depending on the way of seeing it, you could even say that their atmospheres are the complete opposite.</p><br/><p>Could it be that this woman is\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe previous light hero, Sunnysol Ates-sama?!\u201d (Karen)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-174-175-feedback-of-completion\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 174-175 - Feedback of completion\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-178-179-dark-light-woman\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 178-179 - Dark Light Woman\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236319\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

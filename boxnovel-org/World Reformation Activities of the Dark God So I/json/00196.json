Are you okay?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The winner Mirack walks towards the fallen Kyouka.</p><br/><p>It looks like Kyouka was temporarily out of commission, but she soon regained consciousness and borrowed the hand of Mirack to stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I lost huh. This time for sure. It was great, Mirack.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Kyouka was sportsmanlike to the result.</p><br/><p>Her original nature must have been her straightforwardness as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut \u2018Fire Blade\u2019 huh. To think you would instead concentrate the fire divine power that has the highest spread out power. I am surprised you thought of it. Well, it was exactly because of it that you were able to break through my \u2018Flame Burst\u2019.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Mother Monsters that we are going to be fighting in the future are of a size that is out of the norms. An area of effect attack from a single human would make scant a difference against them. In that case, we should instead concentrate it all in one place and become bees that attack all at once.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Your fighting style just now has already reached a point that is far from our common sense huh.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Saying until that point, the expression of Kyouka clouded.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t notice at all. I didn\u2019t know that you hated me.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly sorry.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was always keeping you in mind when I acted. That\u2019s how much I respected that straightforward effort of yours\u2026\u2026 But when I ask myself \u2018was there no sense of superiority there?\u2019 I myself can\u2019t answer.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that no matter the person, they can\u2019t move with just a single pure emotion in mind. I was jealous of Sis Kyouka\u2019s strength and felt an inferiority complex towards it. But at the same time, I admired it. I tried to become stronger with you as my goal. But the me that was simply trying to move while only facing forward had ended up seeing nothing aside from what was in front of me. Even though there were a lot of things that I should have been looking back to.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying\u2026they are the ones who have made it possible for you to see it?\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>The comrades in the audience seats that were happy at the victory of Mirack.</p><br/><p>Karen-san who had finished her examination was waving both hands vigorously. Mirack answers this by raising her fist high in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis Kyouka called it being domesticated, but it was exactly because of it that I ended up thinking about getting further strength. There\u2019s a limit to how strong a person can become on their own. The Mother Monsters are opponents that make you understand this. Moreover, there are existences even stronger than that that might be born\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine. No need to say anymore. I lost. There\u2019s no words to say to the loser!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Kyouka patted the cheek of Mirack.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it properly, fire hero.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>This is of no importance, but when I looked at the noble area of the audience seats, the Fire Founder was wailing in manly weeping.</p><br/><p>For him, the two of them are his cute disciples after all.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Just like this, the first match of the old and new heroes had ended with the victory of Mirack.</p><br/><p>So we are leading by one point.</p><br/><p>A bitter voice greeted Kyouka who had lost and was about to leave the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow pathetic. Displaying such an unrefined match like that and still losing. As I thought, the heroes of other churches can\u2019t be relied on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Words close to abuse.</p><br/><p>Passing by the owner of that voice, Kyouka silently says this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen show it to me, this so called refined fighting style of the water hero that you boast of.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I will show you the difference between a true hero and a fake hero.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The second match is the water hero battle.</p><br/><p>The previous hero that stood on the battle stage replacing Kyouka was Ra Sarasa.</p><br/><p>Facing her was of course\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Good job on the opening. Thanks to you winning, I am now in a good mood to sing.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe song will obviously be a victory song, I hope. If that\u2019s not the case, I will drag you out of the stage, you got it?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Exchanging a high five with good momentum, the one who substituted Mirack and went on the stage was the water hero Celestis that had a big smile and shining eyes, dazzling everyone in the audience seats.</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh!! It is Celes-tan!!\u201d \u201cI have been waiting!\u201d \u201cCeles-tan, kyuuuutttt!!\u201d \u201cHoh! Hoh! Hoh! Hoh!!\u201d \u201cC-C-C-Celes-tan!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Incredible cheers were coming from the audience seats.</p><br/><p>The person that even when she is a hero, she is also working as an idol.</p><br/><p>This match where there\u2019s many spectators actually felt like the live performances she habitually holds. Just for this moment, the dome had become the sole stage of Celestis.</p><br/><p>With practiced movements, Celestis makes a smooth turn as she waves at all directions.</p><br/><p>Even bigger cheers burst.</p><br/><p>In this venue that was being covered with a sense of unity, there was a single person that lwas scowling at this.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What a vulgar voice. I am surprised at how those adults can let out such strange voices. It is way too embarrassing.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Sarasa covered her face with her opened folding fan and hides her mouth that was frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, could it be that it is tough to keep up with your granny stamina? But too bad. I still haven\u2019t considered how to give live performances to people of age, you see.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep barking.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Sarasa said in a strict voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I have the chance, I will put it clearly here. I definitely won\u2019t forgive you. You are the shame of us Water Church. Today in this place, I will be handling judgment upon you. Prepare yourself!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>The emotions that Sarasa was directing at Celestis had clear hostility.</p><br/><p>Just why does she hate Celestis so much?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well, I don\u2019t understand things like the formalities and traditions of the other churches. But why is it that you can talk so unfavorably about others with just that reason alone?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The Miki-Moses covers the body of Celestis.</p><br/><p>That divine tool was being clad in water divine power.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I am an idol, but I am also a hero. I will buy that fight you are selling me. Especially the fight you are picking, not only on me but also on my important friends. I will be returning it all ten-fold!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Second match.</p><br/><p>Current hero Re Celestis vs previous hero Ra Sarasa.</p><br/><p>\u201cMatch, begin!\u201d</p><ul><li>197: Mixing without being mixed</li></ul><br/><p>\u201c[Water Rage]!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c[Water Blade]!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The water bullet shot from the Miki-Moses of Celestis, and the high pressure water blade released from the water folding fan, Dahyu, of Sarasa.</p><br/><p>Both of them clash in the air and, no matter the times, the high-pressure blade won and would cut the water bullet in half.</p><br/><p>Celestis had to avoid the water blades that continued on with its original speed.</p><br/><p>And I was busy erasing them with dark matter to make sure the water blades didn\u2019t attack the audience.</p><br/><p>\u201cHohohohoho~~, how is the sharpness of the \u2018Water Blade\u2019 released from the water folding fan? That childish water play of yours doesn\u2019t even serve to delay them.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water folding fan, Dahyu, was made from the same cloth as my robe, Miki-Moses. The biggest trait of the folding fan is that it is firmly serving as the bone for the cloth which makes the water bullet take that blade-like form.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water bullet that has been made thin due to the paper and cloth can already be called a water blade. It will cut everything. In my active days, several hundreds of monsters have become rust to this blade.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cRust in a water blade, can you make a less coherent sentence?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The retort of Celestis only felt like her distracting herself from her pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe biggest strength of the water divine power is its wideness in practical use. At times, it can wet your thirst; at others, it can create raging streams; and at other times, it can rot something by stagnating it. Just like how water itself has innumerable faces, the water divine power can be divided with just a single change. My water folding fan is one of those faces.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The robe of Celestis and the water folding fan of Sarasa; even within the divine tools of the new and old heroes, the divine tools of these two are the ones that are the most different in form.</p><br/><p>The reason for it has been revealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to that, Celestis-san, that robe of yours feels like it is a representation of the wavering character of its user. The cloth that one would normally adjust to their own individual traits, you have utilized it just as it is; that\u2019s unheard of. I am shocked by your blatant negligence.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? I myself think that I have drawn a jackpot though.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just because your brain is lacking!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>A water blade was released again.</p><br/><p>Celestis already didn\u2019t try to stop it with a water bullet and concentrated on avoiding.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were always like that! No matter when, you would never be serious. You didn\u2019t care about troubling others! Have you thought about how much trouble your arbitrariness causes to others?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, I don\u2019t remember causing you trouble though?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>A slightly bigger water blade was going straight at Celestis.</p><br/><p>Celestis, who had her posture crumbled due to the constant evasion, was unable to cope with it. She spread her robe and used it as a shield, somehow managing to deflect it that way.</p><br/><p>But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that this was one-sided.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-san, a self-centered girl like you becoming a hero, wasn\u2019t that a mistake in itself? Saying stupid things like being an idol, you are truly odious. I will correct that mistake of yours!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Is there nothing that can be done anymore?</p><br/><p>Just when I thought this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think a little, you know.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEspecially since the time I began fighting together with Karen-chi and the others. \u2018Just what can I do inside that team?\u2019, I thought of it deeply. And the conclusion that came out was\u2026to bring the best out of the water\u2019s wide amount of uses.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you blabbering about?! I don\u2019t care anymore. I am finishing you here!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Just as she declared, Sarasa released her last water blade.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>*splash!*</p><br/><p>\u201cKya?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the water blade was released from Sarasa\u2019s folding fan, it broke and dispersed. While making a big splashing sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook below you.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Following her words, I noticed that the surroundings are in an abnormal state.</p><br/><p>It was flooded.</p><br/><p>The floor of the battle stage that they were standing on was drenched as if a downpour had passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the water I created. You were shooting so many water blades, cutting down all my water bullets. You were a great help in camouflaging. This water here has my divine power in it, so it moves on my whim. Just like this\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis waves her robe.</p><br/><p>As if in concert, the pool of water covering the floor shot a water bullet and grazed Sarasa.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiih?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water blade that you shoot is basically a water bullet that has been thinned. That\u2019s why, even if it\u2019s strong against attacks from the front, it is weak against attacks from below. In rock-paper-scissors, the paper wins against the rock because the paper covers it, but you see, in reality, the rocks penetrates the paper!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying you shot down my water blade the moment I released it?! Were you in the defensive until now to create this water domain?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s return to the talk a few moments ago. The strength of the water divine power is in their wide ways of use. My Miki-Moses can be said to be the divine tool that brings out this strong point to its highest.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>A simple cloth; the Miki-Moses that could even be described as that, would at times undulate, and at other times, it can become tough like a rock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cloth is soft and can change its shape to anything. That\u2019s why it can become a sword, spear, shield, and even an armor. When injured, it can become a bandage, a curtain that blocks the sunlight, an overcoat to endure cold; it can become anything.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>And in reality, at the fights with the giant monsters, we have been saved countless times by the handyness of Celestis.</p><br/><p>Karen-san had been treated by her \u2018Water Heal\u2019 just a few moments ago too.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to that, Sarasa, what about you? Placing a bone to your cloth, you are now able to bring out a water blade from it. But because of that, you have lost all other uses. By specializing in attack, you have forgotten the important wideness of use. Is that really the correct form of the water hero?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! [Water Blade]! [Water Blade]!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Sarasa has been releasing water blades several times while Celestis was talking, but they were all shot down by the water bullets that came from below.</p><br/><p>The flow of the battle had turned completely into Celestis\u2019 side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I will now be showing you the water hero\u2019s true way of fighting. [Water Blessing]!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis clads the surface of her body in water divine power and slides on the water drenched floor with overwhelming speed.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Water Blessing\u2019 that\u2019s originally used to walk on top of water, to think that it could be used in this kind of way.</p><br/><p>And with that, she instantly closed the distance between her and Sarasa.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Water Rage]!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgyaaaa!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>A water bullet released at close range, with that, Sarasa can\u2019t intercept it with a water blade.</p><br/><p>Aiming at that instant of an opening\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOn top of that, [Water Bag]!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The water current that was released from her robe had imprisoned Sarasa in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>A mobility technique, an offensive technique, and a restraining technique; it is certainly true that the variety in the water divine power is a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you! Let me out! Let me OUT!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. You can\u2019t escape from the \u2018Water Bag\u2019. You don\u2019t have the stamina remaining for that.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Water Blade\u2019 is certainly a powerful offensive attack, but it utilizes as much divine power. You are making high enough water pressure to cut through even iron after all. Who knows how much divine power you would need to create such pressure.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Maybe she hit the bullseye, the beautiful face of Sarasa warped in mortification.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I will be correcting one misunderstanding you had. It seems you are thinking that you are the only one who can shoot those water blades with that water folding fan, but too bad, my robe can also shoot them.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis spreads her Miki-Moses wide and, just like that, she began to spin rapidly.</p><br/><p>The cloth that\u2019s endowed with water is heavier than what anyone could imagine and becomes hard.</p><br/><p>By utilizing this, the Miki-Moses that had a large amount of water divine power poured into it, took advantage of the centrifugal force of the turns and\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cRevolving Style, [Water Blade]!\u201d &lt;Jutsu!&gt; (Celestis)</p><br/><p>A water blade that revolved like a boomerang was released from the Miki-Moses.</p><br/><p>The water blade had sliced apart both the water prison and the captured Sarasa\u2014or so I thought, but the water folding fan blocked it.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaa!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>But the impact of it had destroyed the water folding fan, and, unable to kill all of the force, Sarasa herself was also send flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is tiring so I normally don\u2019t do it though. Cutting techniques are the specialty of Sasae-chi anyways.\u201d (Celestis)</p><ul><li>198: Hated person</li></ul><br/><p>This is\u2026should I take it as end of the match?</p><br/><p>The blown away Sarasa somehow managed to stand up, but she is totally exhausted and doesn\u2019t look like she can move at all.</p><br/><p>Her divine tool that served as her weapon has been destroyed, and no matter how I see it, there\u2019s no way to turnaround this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh\u2026Match ends, winner is Celes\u2014\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was shouted at in an incredibly loud tone and was stopped.</p><br/><p>Are you telling me you still have more to do, Sarasa?</p><br/><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t\u2026lost! Celestis-san, I will defeat you\u2026!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Celestis was watching this ghastly Sarasa with the calmness of a lake surface.</p><br/><p>When I look at this, I end up wondering who is the older one here.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You, why is it that you hate me so much?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might be rude for me to say this but, you and I don\u2019t have any connection. Until the day you retired and I was chosen as the successor, we didn\u2019t even have any conversations. At the very least, I don\u2019t remember doing anything to make you hate me.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t\u2026! I do!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u2018So I really was being hated!\u2019, is the kind of mentally fatigued sigh that Celestis let out.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t want to say this, but I heard about this from Papa before the match began.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>When she talks about Papa, she must mean the Water Founder, Ru Azul.</p><br/><p>It is not officially approved, but they are both father and daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you participated in today\u2019s match without telling the family you were married in.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the meaning of this?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ra household that you married into after retiring as a hero is a famous mercantile house in Hydra Ville. They are in a position where they can aim for the Water Founder spot if they wanted to. We thought the reason why you picked a fight with us this time was because there was that going on in the back, but early this morning, we received an urgent message from their head.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The head of the Ra household, in the eyes of Sarasa, it would be the father of her marriage partner \u2013her father-in-law.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>[I am truly sorry for the arbitrary actions of my son\u2019s wife. Our household has no intentions of going against the Water Founder; this has all been done on his wife\u2019s own volition. If need be, I will have my son divorce his wife in order to prove the innocence of our household</i>].\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Period.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you, the place you are married into is the place that you finally managed to gold-dig with that hero title you worked so hard for, right? What\u2019s the reason to hate me so much to the point that you would throw away your dreamed celebrity life?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sarasa didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Could it be\u2026you are hating me because I was born from the womb of the Founder\u2019s mistress?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it! I don\u2019t care about that!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because you are an idol! Even though you are a hero, you show zeal in such a show off game like being an idol! I really can\u2019t forgive that!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Hearing the declaration of Sarasa, Celestis went \u2018eh?\u2019 as she made a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that something that shouldn\u2019t be troubling you at all? No, well, I have my own thoughts regarding that, you see.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You <i>are </i>troubling me! You are truly troubling me!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe good match that I finally found after harsh tribulations as a hero\u2026! The third son of the wealthy Ra household; a handsome man with excelling physical ability and high academic achievements\u2026!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The more I hear, the more I think it is a find of superior quality.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was truly happy being able to marry such a person, and yet\u2026! Out of everyone, that person had to\u2026\u2026\u2026.become a big fan of yours!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Hm?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Fan? In other words, a fan of mine as an idol?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! He made a room for that exclusive use and, in there, it is filled to the brim with your idol goods! It is truly disgusting! He also doesn\u2019t miss a single live performance of yours and boasts about it! In front of me,<i> his wife</i>! Do you know how I feel at those times?!! Can you imagine it?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Uwaaa\u2026that\u2019s harsh.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaa~, well, thanks for the support.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than thanking me, please apologize! Lately, he has been requesting craftsmen to make a life-sized doll of you!! I did stop him in tears though!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Is that what a rich person should be doing?! &lt;or a person in general?! \u2014not judging taste though <b>( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)</b> &gt;</p><br/><p>\u201cMy woman pride is already in tatters! I have thought many times of throwing away all the idol goods while he is away! But when I think about him losing his affection towards me if I were to do that! Aside from that one point, he is a truly rich, good-looking, and kind husband! This is horrible. So harsh!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Sarasa finally prostrated and began crying.</p><br/><p>Her husband is infatuated with an idol \u2014in other words, Celestis.

That\u2019s how it is called, but it is actually the tiger\u2019s den.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san~~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI love you~~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>To explain what\u2019s happening, I was made to sit down on the sofa that was in the room, Yorishiro placed a bed cover on me, is rubbing her cheeks together with mine, and is drawing circles on my chest with her finger over and over.</p><br/><p>Looks like she is truly having fun.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t push her away and can\u2019t resist either.</p><br/><p>Because that\u2019s the kind of deal we had.</p><br/><p>In the big sea battle the other day at Hydra Ville, in order to outwit the Water God Coacervate who was the wire puller of it all, I worked out a plan.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the help of a powerful ally, the heroes were able to splendidly defeat the 8-headed Great Sea Dragon.</p><br/><p>And so\u2026</p><br/><p>What I had to do in order to create that monster was\u2026to first learn how to make it.</p><br/><p>Monsters are made by Gods.</p><br/><p>This is a secret of the world, but it is the truth.</p><br/><p>I -Kuromiya Haine- am also a human, and at the same time, am the reincarnation of the Dark God Entropy.</p><br/><p>I do have the qualifications to create monsters, but since I was sealed for 1,600 years, I have been estranged from the worldly affairs and ended up not knowing how to create monsters.</p><br/><p>And so, the one I relied on in that time of emergency was this person; the Light Church\u2019s founder, Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>She can also be called the reincarnation of the Light Goddess, Inflation.</p><br/><p>Different from me, she is a God that had been going strong for those 1,600 years, so when I tried asking if she knew, it was right on the mark.</p><br/><p>The information she gave me played a big part in the victory a few days ago. And so, the price I had to pay for that was also big.</p><br/><p>In the first place, this woman wouldn\u2019t do something so admirable as teaching things for free.</p><br/><p>In exchange for the way of creating monsters, the condition given was to\u2026</p><br/><p>Utilize me freely for one whole day.</p><br/><p>\u2026That\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>And so, here I am, in the middle of fulfilling this one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san~. Haine-san, please say you love me too.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I love you too\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. Ufufu~~\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>This woman really looks happy.</p><br/><p>The moment night ended and it was early in the morning, she immediately called me to her room and we have been like this for the whole time. Well, it is the freedom to use me for one day, so I should at least be grateful that she began utilizing it early in the morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san~.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes, what is it?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease marry me.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro glares at me displeased.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not what we agreed on, Haine-san! You will listen to anything I say for this whole day, right?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what we agreed on. When we were arranging the conditions, we also agreed that I would <i>only</i> listen to your requests in this day. So, requests that carry on to other days don\u2019t count.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t do that, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to agree on such a condition with a scary woman like this.</p><br/><p>The requests I will listen to are things that can be accomplished in this one day.</p><br/><p>Requests that take more than one day no matter where you look at it are a no. Requests that restrain me on other days are also a no.</p><br/><p>Matters like marrying that bind me for life are of course out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBuuh~, Haine-san, you bully\u2026\u2026 T-Then, how about the embrace between a man and a woman?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>What shameless things is this woman saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s also a no. If a baby is made, it would drag on further than my life.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, you cheapskate! This is a no, that is a no! You are not listening to anything I ask! You liar!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the one that\u2019s not following the condition. I can revoke the agreement itself on the grounds of rule breaking, you know?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got ahead of myself. Please let us stay like this.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo desperate!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I seriously don\u2019t understand this woman.</p><br/><p>It was the same 1,600 years ago, but I am simply unable to read what she is thinking at all, and there\u2019s no area that I can grasp.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez\u2026 Ah, right. In that case, I want to ask you about something\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s something like who I like the most, it is a no, okay?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be so cautious. Geez\u2026 It is about Coacervate-san. Was that okay?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The Water God, Coacervate.</p><br/><p>He was the wire puller in last time\u2019s incident and the prime offender.</p><br/><p>He was a God, and yet, reincarnated in a monster that had the ability to mimic a human, and controlled human society in the shadows without growing old or falling ill.</p><br/><p>I erased that body of his without leaving a single trace behind, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy is a God. Even if his body is destroyed, his soul will return to the God realm, and it won\u2019t hurt him or itch him one bit. If you were going to defeat him, wouldn\u2019t it have been better to do it like in the case of Nova-san, restraining him in his body with the soul still in it?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>It is just as Yorishiro said. At that time, my anger reached its very peak, and killed him in the mood.</p><br/><p>I have to admit I lost my composure there.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the enemy is a shrewd God. It wouldn\u2019t go as easy as the simple-minded Nova. The body he was using had a dirty ability like mimicking. If he wasn\u2019t restrained to an incredible level, he would escape instantly.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, \u2018it would be better to just kill him given the chance, and at least crush all the groundwork he currently had laid out\u2019, is what you are trying to say huh. Coacervate-san is probably mortified at the God Realm.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. He wasn\u2019t only scheming a fixed fight at the sea live performance. He had a lot of other ill-natured plans on the process while he was advancing this one plan.</p><br/><p>And in truth, after defeating him, I did my best to crush as many seeds of discord he left in the Water Church with the short amount of time I had in Hydra Ville.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, I am surprised you are bothered about those kind of things. Do you feel some sort of camaraderie as Gods?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease stop that. Since the time we sealed you in that fight, I have practically not talked to him at all.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Uwaa.</p><br/><p>Just how hated is that guy?</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, this is the most happiest day since reincarnating in this body as Yorishiro. Just forget about an underhanded guy like him and let\u2019s have fun\u2026\u2026 And so, Haine-san, the next request.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes, a request that can be done today, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course\u2019, is what Yorishiro said filled with confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a date.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><ul><li>63: Holiday in Apollon City</li></ul><br/><p>And so, we are outside.</p><br/><p>Apollon City is one of the cities that has one of the five Churches\u2019 headquarters.</p><br/><p>Of course, it has a fitting population, size, and defenses; a large metropolis that is prominent in all areas.</p><br/><p>Because of the ethereal energy revolution that occurred, the living standard increased, and there are even cars that run around the city on their own energy.</p><br/><p>The buildings have also become bigger and multistoried ones are lined up more frequently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have really gotten used to this sight.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The first time I came to this city after leaving my village, everything I saw was novel, and I was moving my head like a chicken.</p><br/><p>So I am a city person already huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, the streets in the city are congested, so in order to not bump into other people, it is best to hold hands when walking-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! But the other people are not doing that!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they are pros at living in the city. For a beginner that has just been introduced to the city, your evasion technique is still crude, so please give me your hand.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so that\u2019s how it is!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I lift my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a lie. Ufufufu.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The light founder-sama is a person that likes joking.</p><br/><p>And that Yorishiro is currently in pretty normal clothing. Wearing a well-tailored one piece, even when looking at her from afar, one can tell that she is from a good upbringing.</p><br/><p>No one would be able to tell the founder of the Light Church, who is basically the ruler of this city, is in the middle of an incognito date.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are normally wearing a veil in public to hide your face. No surprise that regular citizens can\u2019t see through your identity.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Even if I say identity, it is not the one about being a God, but the one about being the light founder, Yorishiro-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I have been hiding my face because I knew a day like this would come. This time we are spending with just the two of us, if we were surrounded by bodyguards and onlookers, it would be annoying.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Just how much has she been looking forward to this date with me?</p><br/><p>By the way, even with that, when we passed by with our linked arms, there were a lot of pedestrians that glanced at us.</p><br/><p>Yorishiro is just naturally cute after all.</p><br/><p>Karen-san, Mirack, and Celestis; the girls that I have met until now have their own taste and were beautiful, but as expected, Yorishiro is on another level of beauty.</p><br/><p>It is truly a beauty molded by the Gods, or more like, that\u2019s exactly the case though.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, princess, is there anywhere you want to go?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Since I said I will be listening to anything today, it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>I will satisfy this lady to a degree that doesn\u2019t hurt me in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be leaving that to Haine-san -desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOi.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>You were the one who brought me out, so don\u2019t you have a plan?</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, in these moments, isn\u2019t the man supposed to be the one doing the escorting?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The eyes of Yorishiro, who said this, had the light of a bully in them.</p><br/><p>So she intends to enjoy the flustered state of this country bumpkin huh.</p><br/><p>But too naive. Learn that this Kuromiya Haine has no blind spots!</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood! Well then, I will escort you to my recommended date spots!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Having her linked arm pulled by me, Yorishiro was filled with surprise and confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo naive, Goddess-sama. The things you would say, I have already predicted them beforehand. I already knew you would be bringing me out on a date with that one day privilege you got, so yesterday, I already researched on those kind of stores!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Got ya there.</p><br/><p>Seeing this date plan that has no blind spot and unable to say a single complain, I will watch and laugh at Yorishiro\u2019s mortified figure.</p><br/><p>When I turn to the side to look at the crushed expression of hers\u2026eh?</p><br/><p>What I saw was an expression that was contrary to what I was expecting. Her eyes were moist and glittering, and her face was filled with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean\u2026for my sake?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if she is asking me or talking to herself; after making such a hard to distinct mutter\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, I love you!!!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOoou?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The arm that was wrapped around hers in the first place was being held with extreme force now!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, let\u2019s marry! I will decide the destination of our date! The church! After making our pledge, I will thoroughly enjoy the date plan that Haine-san made, and then\u2026!\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! It had the opposite effect?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>What I thought would make her mortified actually pleased her instead.</p><br/><p>Or more like, isn\u2019t the church the place where you are living in?!</p><br/><p>Since we both received answers we didn\u2019t expect, should this be considered a draw?</p><br/><p>The first match was muddy, and our date had only just started.</p><ul><li>64: Date a Live &lt;Reference to anime of the same name (literally)&gt;</li></ul><br/><p>And so, I escorted Yorishiro to the many recommended spots.</p><br/><p>Cafe, confectionery, an okonomiyaki store, a pasta-specialized store, seafood store, a pizza store\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026All of them were food stores-desu wa ne.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The one who recommended me these date spots was my friend in the kitchen days, Frost.</p><br/><p>Since the time I graduated from the kitchen and became a hero assistant, he has still been doing his best in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>And all the stores that he recommended to me were eateries. Isn\u2019t he getting dyed by the cook soul at a fundamental level?</p><br/><p>Seeing these many varieties of eateries at the streets does make me understand how much the ethereal development has affected many sides of society, but after going around so many of them, as expected, my stomach is already completely full.</p><br/><p>Leaving me aside, girls have a smaller stomach, and Yorishiro doesn\u2019t look like she can eat that much, and yet, she said: \u2018there\u2019s no way I would leave food in the stores that Haine-san has brought me to\u2019, and ate everything without leaving anything behind. Even when I tried to stop her in the middle of it, she said: \u2018this is the date plan that Haine-san made, I will go through all of them\u2019, and in the end, we ended up conquering all the stores.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?! Sorry! You didn\u2019t have to force yourself to eat everything!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026! Uppu\u2026 there\u2019s no problem-desu wa. This is my first date with Haine-san. Guuh\u2026 I am currently in perfect form\u2026 ppu\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t lie. You are already on the verge of breaking down!</p><br/><p>At any rate, we have to find a place to rest! I can\u2019t bring the Founder-sama to a dirty water fountain!</p><br/><p>Even so, we can\u2019t go to an eatery or a popular resting spot. Right now, Yorishiro is completely filled, and one push would make her release everything!</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t there a place that doesn\u2019t smell of food at all and we can rest?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah, right!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>That place.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see, the library huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yorishiro, who regained her composure, muttered this.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. This is the grand library located at the central section of Apollon City. Since it is a place for reading, there\u2019s a lot of places here where you can sit and relax.</p><br/><p>From the information that I got of Frost, this is the only place that wasn\u2019t an eatery. \u2018It is great that you can sit for free\u2019, is the random reason he gave me for this recommendation, but anyways, it saved me at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay? Do you want me to rub your back more?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is plenty already. As I thought, Haine-san is kind.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>I feel like my points with her have increased pointlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it has been a while since I have come here. I have been busy lately after all.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? You like books?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that. I am the Founder of the Light Church, so there are plenty of times when I come here for public facility inspections.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Ah, so that\u2019s what it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe diplomatic side has been restless lately, so the times I have gone for inspections and visits has decreased though\u2026\u2026 Did you know, Haine-san? This grand library of Apollon City has the biggest scale and has the most amount of books in the world. It is the pride of the people living in Apollon City, you know.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh, so it is such a big deal.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Treasure knowledge; that can be considered one of the primary factors that make a human.</p><br/><p>That feeling was passed on properly even in these modern times.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there was a plan of reducing the scale of this library.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOi.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe creed of the Light Church and its history, they said that all publications that have no relation to those kind of things have no worth. There\u2019s also books about ethereal techniques, and they said: \u2018that\u2019s the very definition of harmful books\u2019.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that? Does that mean everything that\u2019s not convenient for them is evil?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI did stop them and avoided the massive book burning that might have occurred, but\u2026the current Light Church is mostly like this. Only they are correct, everyone that\u2019s not the same as them is inferior or evil.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>She is literally the most important person of the Light Church in two meanings. She is their founder and also the Light Goddess Inflation that the Church worships.</p><br/><p>And she is saying this while sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know, Haine-san? Right now, the upper echelon seats of the Light Church are mostly hereditary.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Really?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI myself am the daughter of the previous founder. That\u2019s why, as long as I thought on where to reincarnate, I could have easily become the founder. Aside from that, there\u2019s the Cardinal, Great Priest, and the Knight Commander; all of them are jobs that have a set household. Haine-san, did you know this as well? When entering the knight corps, you had to get your element identified in advance on the pretence of an exam, didn\u2019t you?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there was that.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe current Knight Commander, Dobbe-san, do you know the light element number he has?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, could it be?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHis household, the Severphon household, is a household that has been turning in great numbers of Light Church upper echelon members for around 20 generations. The higher-ups of the Light Church are filled with those kind of people. People that have been sitting at the top for so long, drinking the sweet nectar, and were unable to live without it\u2026..just like \u2018those\u2019 ones.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, they are most scared of falling from the top. Because they can\u2019t live anywhere aside from that place after all. They hardened that position with their blood relatives, and they refuse it the most when someone new enters. If someone were to get close to them, they would do their utmost to eliminate that person.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cLike that time with me?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, and also Karen-san as well. Only the post of the hero that has no impurity in it and is chosen purely by ability can\u2019t be passed on hereditarily.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>So this is the so called depravity of an organization huh.</p><br/><p>It is true that groups do rot the longer they persist. No matter what it is, once the flow is lost, it will stagnate, become impure, and deteriorate.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, there will be times when a revolutionary will appear and create a windhole, and then change the inside with new things, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you not going to do it?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cA reformation. You are in the position of a Founder, and coupled with your wisdom as the Light Goddess, wouldn\u2019t it be easy to wipe out the old influential powers?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>From what I see, she doesn\u2019t look like she agrees with the decay of the Light Church after all.</p><br/><p>When I said this, Yorishiro smiled sadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san, there are times when a way too excelling leader will instead become harmful for the group, you know?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The side view of Yorishiro was beautiful as always, but it somehow looked like an old woman who has lived several centuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, the two over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to continue the conversation, but we were called out by someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you please keep it down in the library?

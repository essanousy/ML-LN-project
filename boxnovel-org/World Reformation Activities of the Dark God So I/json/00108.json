It is my fault.</p><br/><p>While running through the Light Grand Church at full-throttle, I was tormented with self-deprecation.</p><br/><p>Even though we had gotten along\u2026</p><br/><p>The earth hero, Gonbee Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>For the first time since she was born, she left her homeland, and in the strange land she had arrived and was on the peak of helplessness, she would meet the first people she could open her heart to.</p><br/><p>Those people were supposed to be us, and yet, I was unable to accept what she had said, and rejected it all along with her very self.</p><br/><p>With this, it feels as if I made her trust us just to betray her.</p><br/><p>Right now, the meaning of what she said about that oracle doesn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>I have to catch up with Sasae-chan and apologize as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>The chances of Sasae-chan still being inside the Grand Church is high.</p><br/><p>It is big and easy to get lost in here after all.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a chance that Mirack-chan or Celestis-chan, who separated to cover more ground, will find her sooner than me, but I have to make sure to be the first one to find her, and apologize properly to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren?!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of it, I stumbled upon Mirack-chan at a turn.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it?! Did you find Sasae-chan?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even a shadow! If we have met here, it must mean that she wasn\u2019t in your search area either. In that case\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Is what we were thinking when\u2026</p><br/><p>*Zudon*, a sound strong enough to make the whole building tremble reverberated.</p><br/><p>When I look out from the window that was close by, I could see a waterspout from afar. There\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s the work of Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat direction is\u2026the outside plaza?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that woman doing?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>At any rate, there\u2019s no doubt that something happened.</p><br/><p>This is no moment to be caring about manners. I jump from the window, and control the fall with my light divine power, and head at full speed towards the waterspout.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! Hey, wait, Karen!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan followed after.</p><br/><p>This Light Grand Church is my base, that\u2019s why I can tell. The place where the waterspout came from is the plaza. It is normally used as a training space for the people of the Aurora Knight Corps.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it is wide without any obstructions, so there\u2019s no problems in having a waterspout as big as that being made, but\u2026but why did Celestis-chan do that kind of technique in the first place?</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p>\u2026While I was thinking that, we arrived.</p><br/><p>The first thing that entered my vision was the back of Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAah, you are finally here. I was waiting!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It hasn\u2019t been long since we split to search, and yet, Celestis-chan was talking as if we haven\u2019t met for several years already.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-chan! Did something happen?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead of explaining, it would be faster to just see it with your own eyes! Look at that!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>And then, being suggested by Celestis-chan, I look, and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! Monster.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. There\u2019s a monster in the training grounds.</p><br/><p>It is the first time I have seen this type, but there\u2019s no doubt that this is a monster.</p><br/><p>It is big and humanoid. From what I see, it is made up from what seems to be minerals.</p><br/><p>The looks of monsters are normally uniform. If it\u2019s fire element, it is a land beast type; if it\u2019s water element, it would be a fish or a water lifeform; if it\u2019s wind element, it would be an insect type.</p><br/><p>But this is the first time I see this type of monster. It gives a different kind of atmosphere from the Dark Giant-san we met in the Great Sea Dragon battle. Just what in the world\u2026</p><br/><p>Since this is a training ground, there\u2019s -as expected- many light knights that were here in the middle of training, and were now surprised by the sudden appearance of a monster and were agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think a monster would appear in a place like this! And so, Celestis, what happened to Sasae?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan who had finally caught up, asks this from Celestis.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026She is right there, you know.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said, she is there! Look, over there!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>In the place where Celestis-chan points at, at the aforementioned monster.</p><br/><p>I was wondering what she was saying so I strain my eyes to see, and what I saw was\u2026a girl standing at the back of the giant earth humanoid.</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chan?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Why is she at a place like that? She is close to the point that you could say she is clinging to the leg of the monster!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is she at such a place?! That\u2019s dangerous! Hurry and get away!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up-dasu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Words of denial that felt as if they pierced at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery one of you! All the city people be enemies-dasu! My only ally be this child-dasu! \u2018Golem Boy\u2019! Kick \u2018em away, don\u2019t let \u2018em get close!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Saying this, the humanoid monster rushes at us as if it were following her desires.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I fall back in order to evade.</p><br/><p>And so, Sasae-chan stood alone at the place where the humanoid monster was before, and takes something out from the rucksack she had brought for her journey.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that? A brick?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap! Again?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Seeing that brick, Celestis-chan gets agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat girl, is she thinking of making more of those?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cMaking? More of those?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI had found that girl and cornered her all the way here. After that, that girl took out a brick that looked similar to the one she has now, and wrote something on it. And when she did that, the earth and stones in the surroundings of the block began to gather, and what came out of it is the giant thing that you see now before your eyes!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Eh? Then\u2014!</p><br/><p>The two blocks that Sasae-chan is holding currently in her hands are\u2014!!</p><br/><p>\u201cC\u2019mere! \u2018Golem Father\u2019, \u2018Golem Mother\u2019!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><ul><li>109: Puppet Sumo</li></ul><br/><p>There\u2019s a total of three.</p><br/><p>Right in front of us, monsters we have never seen before had appeared.</p><br/><p>The three shared the trait that they were all earth puppets.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Golem Boy\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>The first one to appear from the earth humanoids.</p><br/><p>As of now, it is the smallest one of them, but even with that, it easily surpasses the height of a man at his prime.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Golem Mother\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>And there\u2019s the one that slightly surpasses the small one, but is a slim figured earth humanoid.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd \u2018Golem Father\u2019!!\u201d</p><br/><p>And finally, there\u2019s the biggest one of all three, and even its physique was that of a heavyweight.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Golem Family\u2019!! Defeat dem scary city people-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>As if obeying the orders of Sasae-chan, the earth humanoids take a stance towards us.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, I couldn\u2019t help but be bewildered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Are we in a dream right now?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs a hero controlling monsters?! What\u2019s that? It doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan were both bewildered as well.</p><br/><p>Heroes exist to defeat monsters.</p><br/><p>They fight against the monsters that attack humans, defeat them, and protect them; it can even be called our raison d\u2019etre.</p><br/><p>And a hero is utilizing the monsters that are our natural enemies?</p><br/><p>But we don\u2019t have the leeway to space out right now.</p><br/><p>Right now, those very monsters are about to attack us after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, return fire! The light knights in the surroundings!! This is too much for you guys to handle. Don\u2019t get close, got it?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Since this is the training grounds of the Aurora Knight corps, many light knights were there.</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan gave orders to them, and stopped any disorder before it happened.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s three earth humanoids attacking us.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s three heroes on our side.</p><br/><p>The numbers are the same, but even with that, I can\u2019t say that this is a favorable situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chan!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It naturally turned into each one of us dealing with one earth humanoid.</p><br/><p>The one I had to deal with was the middle-sized slim doll. While evading the chops it was swinging, I shout at Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?! What\u2019s going on?! Why is a hero using monsters?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat-suka? Yer a city folk, yet ya ain\u2019t knowing Golems-dasu ka?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Golems?!</p><br/><p>\u201cGolems be the blessing of Mother Earth God-sama-dasu! They help us in anything and are the friends of humans-dasu! They don\u2019t lie to me like ye guys. They be trustworthy fellows-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words became a thorn that pierced right through my chest.</p><br/><p>I want to apologize with all I have, but the situation is not allowing me to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan, who was in the same battle conditions, overlapped her back with mine.</p><br/><p>Being the one that proclaims herself to be the strongest, Mirack-chan has been charged to deal with the strongest looking one, the \u2018Father\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad, Karen! That Celestis is being pushed back!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I looked, Celestis-chan was fighting with the smallest one -\u2019Boy\u2019-, but even with that, her situation was unfavorable.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Water Wrath]!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The water bullet that came out from Miki-Moses struck directly at the Golem, but there wasn\u2019t any effect. It became a sad splash at the face of the Golem\u2019s sturdy body and was swallowed by the earth.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Water Wrath]! [Water Wrath]! [Water Wrath]! Huuuh~, as expected, it has absolutely no effect~~!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>In terms of elemental affinity, earth is the worst possible opponent for water.</p><br/><p>It looks like that law is definite here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will provide support! Karen, please hold back the other two!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and I both revolve with our backs still sticking to each other, and then, at the gaze of Mirack-chan, there\u2019s the small-sized Golem and Celestis-chan; at my gaze, there\u2019s the two other Golems. A nice positioning was formed.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Holy Light Blade]!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c[Flame Knuckle]!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The \u2018Holy Light Blade\u2019, that I held back when releasing, knocks down both of the Golems in front of me. Because of this, I was able to stop their movements just as planned.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the fire bullet that Mirack-chan released from the fire fist Barbarossa hit the small Golem, blew it away, and saved Celestis-chan from her predicament.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks! You saved me there!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Because the Golem was blown away and she had gotten distance from it, Celestis-chan runs to where we are in order to strengthen the defense.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are useless! Can\u2019t you conquer something measly like affinities?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cShad up! I\u2019m throwing those words right back at you, you useless woman in the Great Sea Dragon battle!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan probably said this with the intentions of getting back at Celestis-chan for before.</p><br/><p>At that time, Celestis-chan said as much as she wanted at Mirack-chan after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, we are talking about affinities here, so how about we just slap it with the element that is strong against it! What was the element that was strong against earth again?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wind element! There\u2019s none here!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The wind element that dries the earth, and disperses the sand, is the natural enemy of the earth hero and the earth monsters in general.</p><br/><p>But the person that possesses this element is not within our group!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh geez! Why is it that we are gathering at a decent pace, and yet, we can\u2019t get the ones that are needed at the desired moments?! If that chibi had been in our fight with the Great Sea Dragon, it would have helped us out a lot!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Is she talking about Sasae-chan who is currently antagonistic towards us?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo noisy! If you were at the time we fought the fire cow Phalaris, you would have at least been useful!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>And Mirack-chan bites at it.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not it.</p><br/><p>It is true that the current situation is bad, but there\u2019s a reality we have to pay more attention to.</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chan!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I call the girl that was at the other side of the Golems.</p><ul><li>110: Missing each other</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chan!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>My shout made the small shoulders of the girl at the other side of the Golems tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for what I did before! Shouting at you\u2026saying that you were a liar! I was just surprised by what you said. That\u2019s why I unintentionally lost it there!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I really don\u2019t know what to say to regain the trust of Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>But this is what\u2019s necessary. Rather than pinning her down by force, I have to tell her how I feel by wringing out the words inside of me.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, even if I don\u2019t know what to say yet, I let everything come out from my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly sorry for scaring you. Coming to an unknown land on your own, you were feeling lonely, and yet, I didn\u2019t think about your feelings at all. But even if you rampage here, nothing will be resolved. Put back these Golems and let\u2019s have a calm talk once again, okay?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not going to fall fer yer lies again!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>But what came back at me was rejection.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can tell. Ye girls know Kuromiya Haine, right?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being hit right in the mark, I was left speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why ye got so panicked by it. Ya desperately tried to deny it. Mother Earth God-sama told us Kuromiya Haine be the personification of an evil God-da.\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that must be some sort of mistake!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSee?! Ya have showed yer true hide! The light hero be colluding with the evil God-da! If ya be denying the words of Mother Earth God-sama, that makes ye the enemy of Mother Earth God-sama. In other words, the enemy of the Earth Church; in other words, mah enemy! Golems, smash-da!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>As if chains had been broken, the three Golems attack us at the command of Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan, Celestis-chan, and I were parrying those attacks while jumping around.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh geez! Country bumpkins are normally high in the clouds, and yet, they get sharp at the weirdest of timings! The moment she doubts us, she is incredibly thorough about it!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo once we doubt her God, she immediately deems them as enemies huh! This might be the correct reaction as a hero representing the church though!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan and Mirack-chan, this is no time to be complaining.</p><br/><p>As I thought, we really do have to do something about these Golems first or we won\u2019t even be able to have a calm conversation.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s the risk that we might drag Sasae-chan into it, so we can\u2019t use any big moves, but we can\u2019t be leisure here.</p><br/><p>I gather light divine power in my holy sword Saint-George, and instead of releasing it, I increase the sharpness of the sword itself.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Holy Light Edge]!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The swung blade easily cuts both slim arms of the Golem.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done! As expected of the all-purpose Light element!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAgainst the earth element, not only is Celestis completely useless, my fire element is not working effectively either. So the light element that is slightly stronger than all the other elements truly does shine at this kind of times!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The truly all-purpose one is Haine-san\u2019s dark element though.</p><br/><p>In the journey to the Underworld Country, my light element was completely useless, so it is good that I managed to regain some confidence now, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, right now we have to defeat the Golems and calm down the situation!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>As the light hero, I have the duty to calm down this disturbance that\u2019s occurring in my base, Apollon City.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t just neglect that duty of mine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry, Sasae-chan! I will get a bit rough!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yerself-dasu yo! Ye allies of the evil God!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan is completely seeing us as an evil existence!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be showing ya the true power of the earth hero now! \u2018Golem Father\u2019! We going with that formation-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan lifts up that scythe, the earth scythe, Seeta, high up.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, she also had that.</p><br/><p>Because of that small body of hers, and the special fighting style of using Golems, I didn\u2019t imagine it much but\u2026could it be\u2026Sasae-chan herself is going to be fighting as well?!</p><br/><p>The moment I thought this, the biggest Golem that was called by Sasae-chan -also known as \u2018Golem Father\u2019- grabbed Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! What is going to happen now?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The earth scythe, Seeta, that was shouldered by Sasae-chan, was now being held by the Golem.</p><br/><p>The scythe was relatively big, but in the hands of the Golem, it looked like a regular-sized scythe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis be just the beginning-dasu yo! \u2018Golem Mother\u2019 to \u2018Vessel Transformation\u2019!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>With those words, the slim Golem that I had severed both arms began to show a surprising change.</p><br/><p>The originally slim body was getting slimmer, slimmed with no limits, to a point that it had already lost its humanoid shape and had turned into a different form.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat looks like\u2026a thread? No, a chain?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard about this before. The transformation ability brought by the Earth divine power. All the solid bodies that are under the rule of the Mother Earth God can be transformed by the earth divine power!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The Golem that had now transformed into a chain was long and thick. Moreover, those chains were slithering like a dragon or a snake, and bite onto the lower part of the earth scythe.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast touch! \u2018Golem Boy\u2019!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>On top of that, the last small Golem is connected to the other end of the chain.</p><br/><p>With this, the earth scythe Seeta is connected to the small Golem?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe formation is completed-dasu yo! \u2018Golem Father\u2019! Smash-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Obeying the order, the biggest Golem grabs the chains of the scythe with the other hand that was not holding the scythe, and then, because of it, the small Golem was dragged along with the chains.</p><br/><p>The small Golem was curled up\u2026like a ball.</p><br/><p>And with that\u2026</p><br/><p>*Bun Bun Bun Bun Bun BunBun BunBun BunBun BunBun BunBun!!*</p><br/><p>The big Golem uses brute force to swing around the small-sized Golem that was connected to the chain.</p><br/><p>Its mass was heavy from the very beginning, so seeing this spectacle from up close had quite the impact.</p><br/><p>The wind that was being created by swinging around the chain was hitting our cheeks stubbornly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?! Isn\u2019t this just like a sickle and chain?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cSickle and chain?! What\u2019s with that complicated terminology?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I had no leeway to retort to Celestis-chan.

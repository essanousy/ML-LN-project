This is the first time I have seen a Celestis-chan this down!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I obviously got worried and pull the clothes of Mirack-chan.</p><br/><p>But Mirack-chan\u2019s expression was still loose.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe ended up like this because she underestimated being an outsider. There\u2019s popular ones in every nation. When an away personality challenges the home of another personality, you will get turned the tables around outrageously. Don\u2019t you think so as well?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan, who was high on her reins, directed her gaze at the other person in the dressing room \u2014the fire cow Phalaris-san in question.</p><br/><p>A small monster the size of a calf was munching on the grass that was prepared in the dressing room.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Or more like, uhm\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I have not been involved with this cow since the fight at the Radona mountain range, but what in the world happened here?</p><br/><p>The Phalaris that I know is supposed to be a fearsome monster, and yet, why is it currently a popular figure in Muspelheim?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the time it became harmless after being defeated by Haine, this guy has been really popular mainly among the children.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Children do love animals after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn top of that, with the raid of the Demon Lord not that long ago where he put his own body at stake to protect the humans, the already high popularity he had had now made a new breakthrough, you see. Right now, the sales of goods related to him have increased by four times. The field trip course of the Fire Church on Phalaris is a long line everyday now, and it is currently breaking several records!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Moreover, I don\u2019t think those records will be changed for a long time!</p><br/><p>\u201cI would say this served as a good learning experience if she is thinking about taking a step out of Hydra Ville! If you want to make it big in this Muspelheim, you have to be at least one tenth of our Phalaris!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>You are taunting her too much!</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan, that\u2019s too much!!</p><br/><p>Just what is going on with you?! Why is Mirack-chan so bitter only at the times when she is dealing with Celestis-chan?!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Celestis-chan was still muttering at the corner of the room.</p><br/><p>Must have been quite the shock.</p><br/><p>In this live performance outside her homeland that she thought would be perfect was all overturned by not even a human, but a cow after all.</p><br/><p>Phalaris continues munching on grass.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Wrong\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was\u2026wrong.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The volume had finally risen enough for me to actually be able to hear Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Being fawned over for being an idol or a hero, I thought of that as my own popularity and got over myself!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, uhm\u2026there\u2019s no need to deny yourself that much\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that I was a frog that didn\u2019t know of the ocean. To think a fluffy animal character would be able to get this much popularity! I have noticed it today. I have received a revelation!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis era is about animals\u2014no, it is about fluffy characters! Idols are already a thing of the past!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Eeeeeeeeh?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will quit being an idol and become a fluffy character!! Please, Phalaris-san!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan prostrated to the cow?!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease make me your disciple! Please make me a great fluffy character!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cWait wait!!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Mirack-chan and I were struck senseless by this and ended up going over to Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Celestis-chan?! If you end up as a fluffy character, not only will you be quitting as an idol, it would mean quitting as a human!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Celestis! Did I overdo it?! I apologize, so please don\u2019t begin anything weird!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>And desperately tried to do a follow-up, but the situation was more serious than expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna! I will also become a cow! If a cow is the trend, I will become a cow! I will also get big boobs, so it should be two birds with one stone, right?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cA Holstein?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Or more like, there\u2019s no need to go so low, Celestis-chan!</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t wish for the impossible!</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-chan!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I reflexively let out a strict voice on Mirack-chan.</p><br/><p>The person herself had her shoulders jump like a child being scolded.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No well, uhm, I was just thinking about teaching this Celestis the difficult path of outside tours!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough about that! Apologize!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>When I said this, Mirack-chan grabbed the shoulders of Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis! I am truly sorry! It is that, you see\u2026 No matter what others say, I like your idol self, you know?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan reacted!</p><br/><p>I have to ride the flow as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! I also love the idol Celestis-chan! Mirack-chan and I will always be cheering for you!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! We are your eternal fans!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>When we said that, Celestis-chan snorted her bright red nose and hugged us both.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwuuuu! I also love you two~~!! We will always always be friends, okay?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>We had no choice but to return the strong hug of Celestis-chan with strength.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with this development?</p><br/><p>The only one seeing us three desperately hugging each other from an outsider perspective was Phalaris who is in the same room as us.</p><br/><p>For some reason, I heard a voice resonate directly in my head.</p><br/><p>(\u2026What\u2019s with this development?)</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was in a tone as if shuddering.</p><ul><li>282: Harmless talk</li></ul><br/><p>\u201c\u2026But you know, I think there\u2019s something to learn about fluffy characters.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan had finally regained her usual pace and said this in a calm tone as she analyzes it \u2014while holding grass and feeding Phalaris-san herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn essence, the animal types are strong in this field. There\u2019s practically no children who hate them after all, and they are easy to make into cute cartoonish designs, so they are good for commerce as well\u2026 What a bummer. The more I think about it, the less openings I find. To think the Fire Church that I thought was filled with muscle idiots had such a commercial strategy going on.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan says: \u2018The simple fact that I was able to realize this has made it worth to have a live here\u2019, as she bites her lips.</p><br/><p>\u2026But Phalaris-san is more of an occurrence after a chain of events, so I feel it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to take as reference\u2026</p><br/><p>By the way, in the corner of goods sales of the live, there were many Phalaris-san goods; Phalaris stuffed toys (S, M, L, XL), badges, keyholders, letter set, pencil box, Phalaris figurines (all five types), Phalaris trading cards (all 70 cards), Phalaris body pillow covers, 1/100 scale Phalaris plastic models (event limited color edition).</p><br/><p>All of them had a killing in their sales the moment they were opened, and the fire members must have gotten quite flustered by that.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it has come to this, there\u2019s no choice but to ride on that flow! We Water Church will also develop our own fluffy character!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It is good that Celestis-chan has regained her energy, but she once again said whatever she thought of.</p><br/><p>When I look at my side, Mirack-chan also had a face of \u2018this woman is once again saying whatever she thinks of\u2026\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cA dreamlike collaboration between the new fluffy character of the Water Church and the idol Celestis-chan! It won\u2019t be a simple 1+1=2; it will be a 200! It will be a hundred times stronger, a hundred times!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be retorting anymore, got it?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>But Celestis-chan really has shocking levels of aggressiveness when it comes to entertainment.</p><br/><p>Even in the live just now, Phalaris-san had taken away all the spotlight, and yet, she quickly moved to assisting and finished it with a bottomline success.</p><br/><p>This surprising level of professionalism, just from where is she bringing all that out?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen talking about a fluffy character of the Water Church, it would definitely have to be a character involving water, right? Water Lad-kun? Water Lifesaver-kun? Swimmer-kun? Wawater-kun?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about Fire Lad?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Mirack-chi! What are you joining the brainstorming for?! You already have a successful subject that\u2019s Phalaris-kun, so be satisfied with that!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine to have a second fluffy character?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell it is fine! Get pulled by your greed and fail!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>While watching over the bickering of those two, I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What about Kotaro-kun?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Yeah, no way.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s close Kotaro-kun inside of my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Kotaro-kun nice?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it is nice with Kotaro-kun.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThey heard me?!!!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>They jumped right onto it!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey Karen-chi, this talk just now, can I use it for the live talk that\u2019s coming next?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way that\u2019s okay!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Just leave Kotaro-kun as my own delusion please!!</p><br/><p>\u2026Damn it.</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan was so crushed just a few moments ago, and yet, why is it that she is so fast in recovering?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t she already bursting in energy!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026with a suddenly thought character like that, it wouldn\u2019t be able to stand against Phalaris-san who already has a rockfirm standing! Rather than a Kotaro-kun that has no background to it, a character with an existing foundation would be more desirable.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Stop! Don\u2019t insult Kotaro-kun~!</p><br/><p>\u201cRight! I have thought of something good!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan was already in a blank state.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the entertainment of now on, a fluffy character is necessary! But in terms of achievements, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to go against the pioneers! In that case, it is fine to just use someone, that already has achievements, as a fluffy character!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, I who already have achievements as an idol should become the fluffy character!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The best fluffy character was actually Celestis-chan herself becoming the fluffy character?</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, isn\u2019t it fine?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan has already given up on thinking!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, show it to us here. This fluffy Celestis you talk about.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! Imma show ya all!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan shows drive and began to concentrate her whole on searching for her own fluffy character.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Celestis~! Love me, love me~!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>And it looks like she found something strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I will love you.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>And for a while now, Mirack-chan\u2019s character has been weird as well.</p><br/><p>The side that wants to be loved, and the side that loves; Celestis-chan and Mirack-chan who fulfilled the requirements on both sides hugged each other.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, this is something I have thought about before but, Celestis-chan might be the maximum loved character.</p><br/><p>Her being a hero and an idol obviously comes from desires like wanting to protect the people and raising the motivation of people by dancing and singing, but at its root, there\u2019s the desire of wanting to be loved by the people that is swirling inside Celestis-chan to the point of obsession.</p><br/><p>It is because she wants to be loved that she can do her best.</p><br/><p>I think that way of thinking is in no way bad as a motivation for a person.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-chi, I love you~, I love you~.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan are still hugging. I also began to feel tingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also love you a lot!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeh, even Karen?! Oi, are we going to be hugging all three of us together?! I totally welcome that but\u2026! Ah, the heat of the two is making my reason fly away~!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>We three are now hugging each other like before.</p><br/><p>I wonder how many times we should repeat this before we are satisfied?</p><br/><p>The one watching over this was Phalaris-san only.</p><br/><p>And then, I once again hear a voice resonating directly into my head.</p><br/><p>(What\u2019s with this scene that\u2019s making my heart jump?!)</p><br/><p>It was mixed with a shudder again.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-278-280-the-late-arriving-idol\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 278-280 - The late arriving idol\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-283-285-shadow-fire-and-water\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 283-285 - Shadow, fire, and water\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236360\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

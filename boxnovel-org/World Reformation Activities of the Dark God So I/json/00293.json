This is the human downfall method that I specially prepared myself.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>The Water Demon Lord Gabriel was showing pride as if she were boasting about her new toy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, I actually evaluate the humans highly. Even if the existence of you humans is unforgivable, the culture that you took time to create is an eye-opener.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Culture; for a while now, Gabriel has been saying that word as if it is already a habit.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we are to eradicate you humans, I am thinking of leaving the culture you humans have created. That\u2019s why I hate destruction that surpasses the necessary. The splendid buildings, the beautiful clothes, the shining accessories; if I were to destroy them, it would end up being incredibly barbaric.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis woman\u2026! She has been saying self-convenient things a while now\u2026!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan furrowed her brows as she showed clear hostility.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you saying that\u2019s why you thought of a way to only destroy humans?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said\u2026destroying in itself is a barbaric act. You see, I want to provide you humans with a peaceful eradication. It is said that all life was born from the ocean. I am the same as well. The Water Mother Monster, Strobbi Laguna, drifted about in the ocean as she gave birth to me. The ocean is the beginning of all\u2026\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Gabriel closed her eyes and spread her arms, as if she were a caring mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I will return them to mother ocean as their last. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s the most beautiful ending?\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026! Don\u2019t tell me\u2026!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the matter, Celestis-chan?!</p><br/><p>She suddenly trembled at the words of Gabriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said it before, right? The pond that everyone is accumulated in is a reserve pond! It stores the increased water temporarily in order to stop floods. Once the danger of flood is gone, it will be drained, and will return to being a dry pond to prepare for the next heavy rain!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Then the accumulated water would be\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cConfluencing at the close rivers and returning to the ocean like that!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It will return to the ocean.</p><br/><p>If that happens, everyone will be lost forever!</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting? The reason why I gathered the undiluted lifeforce here was because I wanted to make the end of you people even more dramatic. The heavily accumulated undiluted lifeforce flowing into the undulating ocean\u2026it would be quite the grand event!!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around! You soused mackerel woman!! I won\u2019t let you do that!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan takes a battle stance as she shouted.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the matter, Celestis-chan?! I understand your feelings of getting angry after what\u2019s been done to your people, but why are you pulling the trigger now?!</p><br/><p>\u201cSarasa said this! \u2018They can still be saved\u2019!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is possible to return the people melted by that soused mackerel woman to normal! She is the Water Demon Lord. If it is an abnormality that occurred due to water divine power, it should be possible to treat it with water divine power! That\u2019s what Sarasa wanted to say!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Sarasa-san rushed onto Gabriel.</p><br/><p>Even if she were to be liquified, she trusted that Celestis-san would save her. She wasn\u2019t trying to pointlessly throw away her life!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if they were to be poured into the ocean, it would be too late. Mixing with the ocean water that is endless, this undiluted lifeforce would end up being diluted, and it would be impossible to return them to their previous human form.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you are getting so hurried?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only time that it can be reverted is when the undiluted lifeforce is keeping its 100% purity inside that reserve pond. If the water gate is opened and the undiluted lifeforce pours out, it is over! We have to defeat Gabriel before that happens! We will save Papa, Sarasa, and everyone in Hydra Ville!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Understood!</p><br/><p>Our objective, what we should aim for, how to win, and what would mean our defeat; we will defeat Gabriel before the undiluted lifeforce is poured into the ocean!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will be fighting as well, Celestis-chan!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will as well! If I didn\u2019t, it would have been pointless of me coming here!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Not only me, Mirack-chan was also overflowing with intent to fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, you two\u2026lend me your strength! Fight together with me to save my important people!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan, Celestis-chan, and I; the only time we had these lineup to fight against monsters was at the battle with the Hydra Serpent.</p><br/><p>We will win just like that time!</p><br/><p>This is a battle we can\u2019t afford to lose!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I add you into the undiluted lifeforce, it would make this a solution of all this city. Isn\u2019t that right, water hero-san?\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>And the battle stance of the Demon Lord was also ready.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat pond is already close to overflowing, so let\u2019s wrap it up in this place. After making you and those two into undiluted lifeforce, let\u2019s begin the long awaited discharge event.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it if you can! Today we will make it clear whose life will be ending!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cToday isn\u2019t an ending but a beginning. The humans in this land will be the beginning to the eventual complete undiluted lifeforce transformation. And then, they will return to the ocean of beginnings. Be grateful that I have prepared such a beautiful closing for you all.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary meddling!! We will be doing the production of our own ending!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The water Demon Lord and the water hero were scattering sparks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are the water people all so poison-tongued?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan pointed out a really sound thing.</p><br/><p>But the opponent is a Demon Lord. It is not someone that you can simply challenge and win.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s the need to understand your own strength and the opponent\u2019s, and plan a way to defeat your opponent\u2026</p><br/><p>Our side has Mirack-chan, Celestis-chan, and I, and also\u2026\u2026\u2026eh? Only us three?!</p><br/><p>There should be another one! Where is she?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s begin. I will be looking forward to how your cultured way of fighting is.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026I have no obligation to answer that expectation.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the shadow at the feet of the Demon Lord Gabriel undulated.</p><br/><p>At the same time as this happened\u2026a girl jumped out from the shadow!</p><br/><p>\u201cDoraha-san?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Since when was she hiding inside the shadow of Gabriel?!</p><br/><p>The position is right at the proximity of Gabriel, because the shadow was stretching at her back, she has completely taken the back of Gabriel.</p><br/><p>Gabriel also had a look as if thinking \u2018why did someone come out from my shadow?\u2019.</p><br/><p>It was a perfect surprise attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have no worth in existing. Break and become simple divine power!\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>The kick of Doraha-san wrapped in shadow attacked the neck of Gabriel.</p><ul><li>294: Battle at the waterside</li></ul><br/><p>Doraha-san\u2019s kick connected onto the neck of Gabriel without any obstructions.</p><br/><p>The kicked neck of Gabriel cracked on and on, and then, only her head flew into the sky.</p><br/><p>It was truly a beheading.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cEeeeeeehhhh?!!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>All three of us were surprised.</p><br/><p>When I look properly, I saw that Doraha-san\u2019s leg was cladded with a shadow shaped sharply like a blade.</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s what became the guillotine that beheaded Gabriel.</p><br/><p>The lost art of altering light divine power into shadow.</p><br/><p>Doraha-san was the strongest user of shadow in the Underworld Country \u2014the shadow hero.</p><br/><p>Her ability of changing a shadow into a blade, and her ability to hide in the shadows; that mastery in the arts of shadow, as expected of the shadow hero. It is on a whole different level from Ates who had just learned about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! Wait, is it over? Is this how it ends?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Water Demon Lord died?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan and Mirack-chan looked dumbstruck at the head of Gabriel that was flying through the sky like a ball.</p><br/><p>Normally, most living beings would die if they had their head cut off, but the monsters that are born outside the logic of living beings\u2026moreover, the Demon Lords that stand at their summit\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat just now was a pretty good attack.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>The cut head of Gabriel was caught splendidly by her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Even when her head and body were separated, as if saying there wasn\u2019t much problem with that, Gabriel caught her head as if she were playing catch-ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are going to make a surprise attack, it should be at the back where the senses of the opponent are the hardest to reach. Taking the back of a strong opponent that you can\u2019t win against upfront is a matter of course. The ability to make that succeed, and to creep your way without making a sound, it is quite the thing. This is culture.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>That abnormality made even Doraha-san falter.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo bad. If it wasn\u2019t me who is made up of more than 90% ocean water, you could have defeated me with that just now. Not only slashes, even if I were to crumble to pieces, I can regenerate.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Gabriel returns her head to its original position. It went back to how it was, as if there wasn\u2019t a wound from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>Her comrade Raphael had survived even when Haine-san destroyed most of the cells of his body.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why this was a development I somewhat expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, you use the divine power in quite an interesting way. That dark divine power, at first, I thought that it was the same as that Kuromiya Haine, but it is completely different. I judge that it is an altered version of light divine power.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Moreover, she saw through the shadow power of Doraha-san with a single attack?</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. The moment a single change is made into something, it turns into culture. Show me more of your culture. Provide growth to the intelligence of us monsters.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t tell me, I will show you. But what comes after isn\u2019t growth, but destruction.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>The surprise attack failed.</p><br/><p>Even with that, Doraha-san valiantly faces her.</p><br/><p>She jumped high and the kick that drew a big arc was aiming at Gabriel\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Shadow Mirror Beak]!!\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra ara, a big kick technique. That\u2019s not really cultured.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>True, the kick of Doraha-san just now was so wide it was easily dealt with using a single arm.</p><br/><p>But that was the aim of Doraha-san.</p><br/><p>Doraha-san was in the sky, and at the ground, there was her shadow. From that shadow, as if it was waiting for Doraha-san, a giant shadow mouth surfaced.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Even Gabriel was surprised at the giant shadow big enough to swallow her whole.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason of the big motion was to move the target\u2019s attention up.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>The shadow that swelled up looked like the beak of a pelican trying to swallow up its prey whole.</p><br/><p>That beak had swallowed Gabriel until her waist, but was stopped by the pressure Gabriel was exerting on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf breaking you will only make you regenerate like water, I just have to swallow you without leaving anything behind \u2014using my shadow.\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>She is trying to do that with the shadow that\u2019s coming out from the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy moving one\u2019s attention up, it makes your legs open, I see. But don\u2019t underestimate me. For a Demon Lord like me, your divine power is just\u2014!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-sama!!\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>Doraha-san calls me.</p><br/><p>\u2026!</p><br/><p>I see!!</p><br/><p>\u201c[Holy Light Line]!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>A beam was released from the holy sword, Saint George.</p><br/><p>The target is not Gabriel but the shadow beak that is trying to swallow her.</p><br/><p>The light spear pierced the shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Interfering with the attack of your comrade?!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>The read of Gabriel was completely wrong.</p><br/><p>The shadow beak absorbed the light and became deeper, clearer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cShadow grows stronger with light divine power!!\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>With the combination of my light divine power, the shadow power trying to swallow Gabriel gets stronger. It was as if a vacuum of darkness was trying to suck her into the shadows.</p><br/><p>The black was clashing with the blue, but the black grew stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>By having a light and shadow user cooperate, it is possible to fight in this way.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not only that. Today\u2019s weather is clear. The natural light of the sun strengthens my shadow and becomes its nutrient. Be swallowed by the strength of this whole world! Be eliminated without leaving a single trace behind, Demon Lord!!\u201d (Doraha)</p><br/><p>What a fight.</p><br/><p>The darkness that tries to swallow everything. It was like a reproduction of Haine-san\u2019s way of battle.</p><br/><p>As I thought, Doraha-san is the shadow hero that has come from the fires of battle a thousand years ago.</p><br/><p>Her surprise attack to light up the sparks of battle was also splendid.</p><br/><p>Even if that surprise attack didn\u2019t work, she has a wide array of techniques that lets her plan further ahead. An offensive battle style that doesn\u2019t let a single moment to breath.</p><br/><p>Everything is not simply because she is a good divine power user, but because she has gone through several scenes of carnage.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren, Celestis!! What are you getting all spaced out for?! We are late to join!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The reprimand of Mirack-chan was thrown at us who were watching the fight of Doraha-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cProtecting this world is the duty of us current heroes. We can\u2019t leave it all to that little girl. We will join the fray!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>It is as Mirack-chan says.</p><br/><p>Leaving it all to Doraha-san would be a disgrace as a hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, cow!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan calls.</p><br/><p>When I looked, I saw that Phalaris-san was at our back. This cow-san that we brought all the way here with our flying machines from Muspelheim to here.</p><br/><p>But why did we have to do all that?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou understand, right cow?! This is the reason why we had you accompany us all the way here!! For the sake of protecting the people of Celestis! Lend me your power again!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>(Good grief, no choice then!!) (Phalaris)</p><br/><p>The cow-san bellows and there was an overwhelming change in Mirack-chan.</p><br/><p>It appears, the fire God Hero.</p><ul><li>295: An attempt for resolution</li></ul><br/><p>From Mirack-chan\u2019s body, an overwhelming fire divine power I have never seen before burns.</p><br/><p>The heat produced from her body was so high that I couldn\u2019t get too close to her, and because of her hair going up due to the intensity of her divine power, it was as if they were undulating like fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026the Fire God Hero?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I have become a light God Hero myself, but this is the first time I see someone else become one. That intensity made me lose my breath.</p><br/><p>Did I look like this when I became a God Hero?</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren, become a light God Hero too. Also, Celestis, leave the Demon Lord to us!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>I was about to ask in more detail about this, but Celestis-chan was faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that, Mirack-chi?! This is Hydra Ville! The ones in danger are the people of the Water Church! Who will fight if not me, the water hero?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am saying that we will take your place in fighting. That\u2019s why, Celestis, you do what only you can do.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018What only I can do\u2019?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan continues speaking while maintaining her God Hero form.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people that were made into liquid, you can return them to normal with water divine power. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, but\u2026are you telling me\u2026!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis, you begin doing that right now. Return those liquified people to how they were with your own hands!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The reason why we didn\u2019t do that and tried to defeat Gabriel first was because she would definitely get in our way.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s most important for us right now is not to defeat the Demon Lord but to save the people.</p><br/><p>In this situation where we don\u2019t know when the water gate will open, prioritizing the undiluted lifeforce is by no means the wrong choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will hold back the Demon Lord. You can\u2019t turn into a God Hero anyways, so not only can you not defeat the Demon Lord, you won\u2019t even be able to hurt her. You should understand that plenty.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Even with the strongest attack of Sarasa-san, she lost to Gabriel without inflicting a single wound.</p><br/><p>In order for the current us to win against a Demon Lord, there\u2019s the need of the God Hero form.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn your current state with no God Hero form, you would only get in the way. You concentrate on saving the people, leave the Demon Lord to us. You are shouldering the most important job.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>To think Mirack-chan could see the picture of the battle so sharply. After becoming a God Hero and gaining experience fighting Michael, Mirack-chan herself has grown.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most important thing is not to defeat the Demon Lord, it is to save the people. That\u2019s exactly right.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>At any rate, I decided on riding it to the right direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will do something about the Demon Lord, so Celestis-chan, save the people turned into undiluted lifeforce. The only one here that can use water divine power is you, Celestis-chan. If they get you, Celestis-chan, even if we were to defeat the Demon Lord, we won\u2019t be able to save the people.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, you are basically the king in this chessboard. The moment you are taken, we lose. Keep that in consideration.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan is intelligent. No matter how much she has lost herself right now, she can\u2019t reject things that have sound logic.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh geez! I get it already!! I will concentrate on saving the people, so crush that soused mackerel woman! I am counting on you, okay?!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Of course, Celestis-chan!</p><br/><p>If I turn into the Light God Hero, it will become the world\u2019s first time two God Heroes fight a Demon Lord. We can gang up on her.</p><br/><p>Doraha-san as well is pushing Gabriel back.</p><br/><p>It is not impossible to defeat a Demon Lord now!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also do it!! Change! Light God Hero!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s with that call?!!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan retorted, but I thought it would be saddening without doing some sort of initial call before transforming!</p><br/><p>But I put a lot of spirit in it to become a God Hero, and yet, there was no change at all.</p><br/><p>\u2026? Only a vacant atmosphere flowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>What? Why?!</p><br/><p>I tried to turn into a God Hero, and yet, why didn\u2019t I turn into one?!</p><br/><p>I turned into a God Hero and drove off Ates, and Mirack-chan managed to transform so easily.</p><br/><p>(I\u2014It is obviously impossible, you light brat!!) (Phalaris)</p><br/><p>That voice is\u2026Phalaris-san?!</p><br/><p>(In order to become a God Hero, the help of a God is necessary! In this moment when Inflation is not close, becoming a light God Hero is a dream among dreams! Or more like, argh, this is tough!! This is tough!!) (Phalaris)</p><br/><p>Phalaris-san said while sounding desperate.</p><br/><p>(Or more like, you people, if you are going to do planning, become a God Hero after! It pointlessly increased the time of my burden!!\u201d (Phalaris)</p><br/><p>What does he mean by that?! Inflation, he says. Does he mean the Light God Inflation that us Light nation people worship?!</p><br/><p>Inflation-sama is not close by? That\u2019s why she can\u2019t help us?!</p><br/><p>But Inflation-sama is supposed to be watching over us all the time!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, it can\u2019t be helped! Doraha and I will do something about this Gabriel!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan makes the flames of her God Hero form swirl.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren, now that it has come to this, please support Celestis! Protect Celestis and make it so that she can fully concentrate on her work of saving the people!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Could it be that I am the most useless one this time?!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan rushed immediately and assaulted Gabriel who is being swallowed by Doraha-san\u2019s shadow.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t let you do as you wish! Stay still until you get swallowed by the shadow!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra ara, I know about you. You are that thing called God Hero, right?\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Her lower body is inside the shadow, her upper body was held by Mirack-chan in God Hero mode, and yet, Gabriel\u2019s calm didn\u2019t crumble.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-chi, what are you doing?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>And a voice reprimands me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it has come to this, we will be moving as planned! Come with me to save the liquified people!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Okay!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan and I quickly ran towards the reserve pond that\u2019s filled with undiluted lifeforce.</p><br/><p>The undiluted lifeforce and the corners of the reserve pond were almost at the same height.</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan simply knelt down and she was already able to touch the surface of the undiluted lifeforce.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is everyone\u2026! Papa and the people I know of!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan\u2019s expression warped in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Celestis-chan\u2026! Right now\u2026!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. In the time Mirack-chi and Doraha-chi are doing their best, I will bring everyone back!! Miki-Moses! Pass my divine power to the undiluted lifeforce!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan\u2019s divine power rises and spreads in the reserve pond that\u2019s filled with undiluted lifeforce.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Celestis-chan? How is it going?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a bit\u2026\u2026 I am beginning to understand. This undiluted lifeforce isn\u2019t simply turning the body of a human into liquid. The information that comprises the soul of the people, it is sealed inside this liquid as well!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Uhm\u2026what?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, by passing water divine power through it and taking out the information of each one of them, the reformation of the body using the undiluted lifeforce as material will begin. In that case, let\u2019s do it! The whole lot of it!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The output of Celestis-chan\u2019s water divine power increases even more.</p><br/><p>This should be mostly the all-out of Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>But is it okay to be letting out this much?!</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-chan, are you okay?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cGuh! The reformation is consuming more divine power than I thought. That soused mackerel woman! She transformed several tens of thousands of people with this technique that takes so much divine power, moreover, she managed to do it in a single day! As expected, Demon Lords are outrageous!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I can tell that trying to save them is incredibly difficult.</p><br/><p>But if we get to save one person, it would be a result in itself!!</p><br/><p>Do your best, Celestis-chan!!</p><br/><p>(I can\u2019t allow you to do that.)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>A voice resonates directly into our head again?!</p><br/><p>Moreover, it is completely different from Phalaris-san. It is a deep viscous voice.</p><br/><p>Who is this?!</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-290-292-ocean-demon\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 290-292 - Ocean Demon\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-296-297-evil-god-appears\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 296-297 - Evil God appears\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236365\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

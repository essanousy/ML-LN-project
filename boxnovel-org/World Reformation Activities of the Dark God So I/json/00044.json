The guest room in such a place is, as expected, quite the extravagant thing. It is a structure that was made in a way that the sea breeze could easily pass through it, so I was able to have a good view of the city\u2019s nightscape.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, show-offs.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack mutters this as she sinks her rear over and over on the soft bed.</p><br/><p>Is she planning on acting that way in all this trip?</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said we can freely pass the time until tomorrow\u2019s live. It looks like we can also do some sightseeing outside as long as we decide on the time.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if this was to have Celestis-san hear out our request, it has become an incredible thing. At first, I thought we would be singing as well, and that flustered me.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>But, as expected, that didn\u2019t happen.</p><br/><p>In terms of artistic performances, these two are total beginners. There\u2019s no way the pro Celestis would have them suddenly learn the lyrics and have them stand on stage. It looks like they can safely spectate from the side.</p><br/><p>Even so, in order to entertain the audience to the highest limits, she said she would be thinking up the best way to show the flashiness of having three heroes together, and then, left to a meeting.</p><br/><p>She really is a zealous worker.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe really was an aggressive person, that Celestis-san. Not only a hero, she also holds pride in being an idol as well.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cTo me, she is only a half-assed person that can\u2019t decide on one thing though\u2026well, that\u2019s what I want to say, but\u2026in truth, even with that, she is still able to properly do her job as a hero.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Eh? Really?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince officially becoming a hero, the number of monsters she has defeated are\u2026not that different from Karen and I. Even when she is putting so much zeal in her hobby. I wonder, just when does she head out to do her subjugations.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. Celestis-san truly is an incredible person. She is properly managing as a hero and an idol\u2026\u2026 Haine-san.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san makes a more serious tone than normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember what Celestis-san said?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Heroes are the face of the church. \u2018Since you have become a hero, you have to fulfill that duty\u2019, is that what she is referring to?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026thought that it was okay for heroes to just defeat monsters and protect the livelihood of the people. But my seat as a hero and my power was given to me by the Church, that\u2019s why, I probably also hold responsibility in regards to the Church.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The serious Karen-san said this with an expression as if it was truly bothering her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that responsibility could be fulfilled by simply defeating monsters. But that wasn\u2019t all. Maybe there\u2019s other things that have to be done. Seeing Celestis-san today, I began thinking that\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san is not wrong.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>First of all, I say this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Celestis said is not wrong, but Karen-san isn\u2019t wrong either. The most important duty of heroes is to protect the people. Karen-san who is always thinking about that as her number one priority is already a splendid hero.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Karen. It can\u2019t be helped that your eyes were stolen by that flashiness of Celestis, but you can\u2019t get lost by it. Also, remember what we came here to do. You went through the trouble of coming all the way here to solve the friction between the five Churches. You are doing plenty enough in your duty for the church.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack also joined me and cheered Karen-san up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. That\u2019s right.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It seems like Karen-san has regained her spirit.</p><br/><p>Mirack and I silently bump fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s sleep already. I will return to my room.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Haine-san is not sleeping here?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>No way that\u2019s possible.</p><br/><p>I am a man of age. If I sleep a night in the same room as them, some sort of mistake will definitely occur.</p><br/><p>Even if I am the reincarnation of the Dark God, as long as I hold a human body, I can\u2019t stay indifferent to the instincts and physiological desires it comes with.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I follow reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I see\u2026 Then tonight, it will be Karen and I only\u2026!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Mirack has a room prepared for Mirack only, so sleep there.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a VIP reception. To think they would give us a personal room for each one of us.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!! This is the very definition of unneeded kindness!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>In the future, even if there\u2019s chances for sleep overs, I promise myself that I will definitely hinder any opportunities of Karen-san and Mirack sharing a room by themselves.</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p>And so, I return to the room that was prepared for me, and just in the moment I was thinking about sleeping\u2026</p><br/><p>*knock knock*</p><br/><p>\u2018Who is it?\u2019 is what I thought as I open the door to check. The one that was standing there was a thin adult man.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You are\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I remember seeing him somewhere before.</p><br/><p>\u2026Right, the person that Celestis was calling Germana. He is probably the same as me, an assistant of the hero or a subordinate.</p><br/><p>\u2018But why is that person here?\u2019, is what I was wondering when the thin man begins to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry for intruding on you at such a late hour. There was something I wanted to talk to you about in given chance, you see.\u201d (Germana)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Something you wanted to talk about? Is it related to tomorrow\u2019s live?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I have no other idea but this.</p><br/><p>Something to talk with a person that he met for the first time today, the only thing that would be is work related.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is already related to that, but there\u2019s also one other thing.\u201d (Germana)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, I have to introduce myself here. I am the manager of Celestis-sama\u2019s idol activities, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager? Not Germana?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That\u2019s only my assumed form. I am actually the reincarnated Water God, Coacervate. It has been a while, Dark God, Entropy.\u201d</p><ul><li>45: The stupid legend of the Water God</li></ul><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What an ill-natured joke.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Are you saying I am lying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is a lie, just with the point that you are talking about being a God when you are a human would already make you ill-natured; if it is true, the point that you are are mixing in with the human society and scheming something unpleasant is already enough to call it ill-natured. Whichever it is, you are an ill-natured person.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Sadly, the moment my identity was revealed, I understood that what he said was the truth.</p><br/><p>An inhuman part of me was reacting.</p><br/><p>Water God, Coacervate.</p><br/><p>One of the five Gods of Creation, and the God that rules over water.</p><br/><p>Water washes away impurities, and purifies the world. But once the stream stops, the water will stagnate and be contaminated. Water then turns into an impurity that rots the world.</p><br/><p>The Coacervate in front of me is truly the personification of that kind of water. Stagnated water that has been contaminated.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you also reincarnated. I am surprised. That means most of the Gods have descended to the surface world?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to do even if I stay in the God Realm after all. By the way, it wouldn\u2019t be recommendable to talk about things like this in the corridor. Isn\u2019t it about time you let me enter your room?\u201d</p><br/><p>If possible, I would prefer not letting a person like this in my room, but with our identities clear now, I can\u2019t just let him go without knowing what this guy is planning.</p><br/><p>I reluctantly let the man into my room. Seriously, as a visitor late in the night, he really is not a partner that makes my heart dance.</p><br/><p>The current figure of this guy. A man in his middle twenties. I have described him as a thin man for a while now, but that\u2019s how it made me think with that well-formed and slender face of his. The only thing is that he is not that handsome to remain in the head of someone, which makes it even more detestable.</p><br/><p>His outfit is probably a formal outfit in this world. It is well-made and truly shows class, but aside from that, there\u2019s no other impressions of it.</p><br/><p>In other words, whether it is good or bad, it doesn\u2019t fall into any of those categories in the impression area.</p><br/><p>It truly makes me see him more and more as that God.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s celebrate our <span class=\"skimlinks-unlinked\">reunion.Dark</span> God Entropy, how did you feel when reincarnating?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me by that name. Right now, I am Kuromiya Haine.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your name as a human, right?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2026I am surprised you were able to notice my identity. I wasn\u2019t able to tell your identity until you told me.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say\u2026it was thanks to a certain simple-minded cow.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>Cow\u2026\u2026 the fire cow, Phalaris.</p><br/><p>In other words, the reincarnated form of the Fire God Nova huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also took notice of the short-circuited and violent plan he had, so I already had surveillance setup for him, you know? And just a few days ago, a mere amount of 3 humans appeared for this so called fire cow subjugation and managed to accomplish it. But, to my surprise, there was one person there who could control dark matter!\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that moment, I understood everything. The one who released you was the Light Goddess, Inflation, right? For these few hundred years, her movements have been unclear after all.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what about it? This time you are thinking about beating her up? Reproducing the same method you used 1,600 years ago, that is.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>When I am talking with this guy, I end up remembering even when I don\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>In the battle of Gods that occurred 1,600 years ago\u2026</p><br/><p>All six Gods created the world at the beginning of it all. Created the sky, sea, land; and then, the vegetation that grows above it, animals and insects, and in the end, we created humans.</p><br/><p>The trigger of that battle were those humans.</p><br/><p>Within all the things that the Gods created, the humans had unpredictable possibilities compared to everything in nature.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, I -the Dark God, Entropy- said this: \u2018Humans are interesting living beings. Let\u2019s give them freedom and see what they can accomplish\u2019.</p><br/><p>And then, the first one to directly object to this was the Fire God, Nova.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no better living being than the Gods! And humans are just lower life-forms that are under the servitude of us Gods!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Light Goddess Inflation didn\u2019t say who was right or wrong, and only said: \u2018I will follow what the Dark God Entropy says\u2019. Even in those days, she was someone I didn\u2019t understand well.</p><br/><p>The Wind God Quasar said: \u2018Whatever the case, this is stupid\u2019, and the Mother Earth Mantle said: \u2018Both opinions are important\u2019.</p><br/><p>In other words, over half of the Gods had not shown any clear siding at first, and in that instance, it was still unknown how it would turn out. However, when the fight begun, it had turned into a one-sided battle of 5 vs 1.</p><br/><p>The one who orchestrated this is the person right in front of me. The one that never showed his opinion until the very end, the Water God, Coacervate.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, you see, I chose the best route, you know?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>Coacervate probably noticed my criticizing gaze. As always, he is sharp in this kind of areas.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever claim were to pass, the fight of the Gods would intensify, and if it were to become a messy fight, the surface world would also be enveloped by the chaos, and life would have died without leaving a single trace behind, wouldn\u2019t it? In order to reduce the damage to its minimum, a fast ending to the fight was necessary, don\u2019t you think?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd because of that, you coaxed the Gods that were keeping their neutrality and placed them in the same side as you and Nova huh. As expected of a scoundrel, it comes with being good at making up excuses. In all situations, you spout sophism and make it so you are not the bad guy.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOya oya, so harsh.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u2026So\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you talk already. Why did you reincarnate as a human, and what are you planning this time?\u201d (Haine)</p><ul><li>46: Water God\u2019s speedy state.</li></ul><br/><p>Water God, Coacervate.</p><br/><p>This guy is currently not a God, but a reincarnated human. Just like me.</p><br/><p>The reason why I reincarnated as a human was purely because I wanted to enjoy the world after 1,600 years long. If I want to observe the human world, being a human myself is the best option.</p><br/><p>By the way, the reason the Light Goddess Inflation reincarnated into a human was because: \u2018I want to give birth to your (Dark God) baby\u2019. A reason that\u2019s hard to understand, or more like, I don\u2019t really want to understand.</p><br/><p>Both of us may have some pretty fuzzy reasons, but the one in front of me is different from us. Coacervate never does things without a reason.</p><br/><p>What he does is always connected to troubling someone, and he never does anything that doesn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I ask him.</p><br/><p>Why he reincarnated into a human.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are quite direct huh. It is as if you are thinking I am someone that has to be scheming something all the time or I will die.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s just how it is, right? Also, it makes it even more suspicious since you went through the trouble of revealing your identity yourself. For you, secrets that the other party has not noticed are the best trump cards, and until the most effective moment to reveal them, you will hide them even if it\u2019s through sheer obstinacy.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way no way. I only came here tonight to reheat that old friendship\u2026\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>A dark stare.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is one of the reasons, but there\u2019s also one thing I wanted to ask of you, you see. For the sake of that, I had no choice but to reveal my identity.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you scheming this time?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, in order to do that, it would be best to tell you from the beginning. Haine-san, what do you think about this present world?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>Coacervate directed that face of his to the window. A gesture saying \u2018look at the world\u2019 huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis world has changed quite a bit from the Genesis era, right? A material called ethereal was discovered and the civilization grew, machines and magic began to mix in the cities of humans, even things like monsters began appearing, and the fighting has grown sporadic.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Gods were the ones who created monsters, right?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that how it was? Well, that\u2019s right.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>For someone like him, this was a rare moment where he actually spoke with a decisive tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was the who proposed the idea of creating monsters.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026As expected. I did think that was the case.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cOya oya, you are not surprised?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really an underhanded method fitting of you, that\u2019s all. Creating these enemies called monsters, you make them attack humans, and make it so humans once again cling onto Gods. Underhanded. Truly the underhanded Water God.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s also the fault of the humans? Even though we are the ones who gave birth to them, just because their lifestyle got a bit more convenient, they forget about their true parents. Monsters might be the screams of us Gods\u2019 hearts saying that we don\u2019t want to be forgotten.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sophism is getting annoying already.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, when ethereal was discovered in the human world , the other five Gods aside from you might have convened and thought up countermeasures?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least be more decisive about something like that.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, the decision called monsters came out. Nova, Quasar, Mantle, and I, created Mother Monsters that hold the element of their respective element. I wonder where they are now? At any rate, as long as they are living in this world somewhere, I think they would create monsters infinitely?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Inflation?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great Light Goddess. Her heart can\u2019t be understood by someone like me.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>So he couldn\u2019t earn her approval huh.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s why there\u2019s no light element monsters.</p><br/><p>If there really are existences called Mother Monsters\u2026it would be dangerous to blindly believe all Coacervate says, but\u2026it would mean that there\u2019s also a fire element Mother Monster and is still giving birth to more monsters.</p><br/><p>Looks like that event that was essentially like sealing the Fire God Nova won\u2019t be stopping the appearances of fire element monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hero plan was also my proposition, it seems?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said, talk more decisively.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other Gods also followed what I proposed and send an oracle to their own Church, and created this system called heroes, it seems? Thanks to that, a structure called \u2018World\u2019s Threat vs God\u2019s Envoy\u2019 was created and looks like this held back the decline of the faith. But I wonder if that satisfied everyone?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cNova looked dissatisfied. That\u2019s why he reincarnated into a cow monster himself.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like he thought of something useless with the lacking brain he has. But there might be others who are actually thinking properly.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about yourself?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter announcing my series of proposals, I immediately descended to the surface world. And then, without leaving it on the hands of the humans, I produced the hero plan myself, I think? But I didn\u2019t only have the hero fight monsters, I also created a number of policies, and increased the effectiveness? Thanks to that, it seems like my Water Church has a lot more believers than other churches?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>So after having everyone participate in his proposal, he alone went and put it into practice himself huh.</p><br/><p>Really does sound just like him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And so, that plan of yours was this idol thing?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The disgraceful behaviour of the singing and dancing hero Celestis pops up in my mind.</p><br/><p>And so, this guy here is working as that thing called manager. A puppeteer that hides his identity while stealthily making his moves.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am simply utilizing plans that are effective for each generation of heroes? That\u2019s probably the best method for the current hero Celestis-san to obtain believers?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might be the case, but\u2026each generation, you say. You\u2026each time a hero takes over, you always do such \u2018commendable\u2019 managing? Just how many times have you reincarnated?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have only reincarnated once though?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s just\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I have been living in this body for more than a hundred years already. I don\u2019t think I have died even once or have been reborn in that time though?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cA human body can\u2019t live that long. No, in the first place, no matter how I look at you, you are around your thirties\u2014\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I say I reincarnated as a human?\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh right, I have only revealed my identity, and haven\u2019t introduced myself yet, right? Let me do it now then.\u201d (Coacervate)</p><br/><p>And then, he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe name of this body is Water Demon, Mephistopheles. A water element monster that has the ability to mimic humans, you know?\u201d (Coacervate)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-42-43-if-pushing-doesn%E2%80%99t-work-pull\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 42-43 - If pushing doesn\u2019t work, pull\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-47-49-water-demon-god\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 47-49 - Water Demon God\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236263\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

In other words, a lot of people were turned.</p><br/><p>Helping those people out and returning them to their places will take quite a lot of effort, so Mirack-chan and I happily accepted to help out.</p><br/><p>When in trouble, we help each other out. That\u2019s how the relationship between the five Churches is now.</p><br/><p>And with that, time continued flowing.</p><br/><p>In this way, we finished the rescue activities to a certain extent and, in the time when it was the calmest\u2026</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cHnfufu~ Onee-sama~!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cOnee-sama, Onee-sama~~!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes\u2026 Wait, what in the world is going on?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Being hugged by Celestis-chan, Sarasa-san was the very definition of confused.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s a given though.</p><br/><p>Within the current and previous heroes, Celestis-chan and Sarasa-san are the ones that have the least respect for each other.</p><br/><p>Compared to Mirack-chan and Kyouka-san, who were disciples under the same master; Sasae-chan and Yoneko-san, who are cousins; and there\u2019s also Hyue-chan and Juo-san who are bitter enemies with Shiva-sama in between.</p><br/><p>These two have an unusual senior and junior relationship that doesn\u2019t share a connection.</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan herself had not showed any sort of interest towards her senior Sarasa-san until now, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOnee-sama, I love you~. Fufufufufu\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Being suddenly called Onee-sama and her over-familiar act of burying her face into the boobs of Sarasa-san, for the people that know these two, they would go \u2018What in the hell happened?!\u2019 no doubt.</p><br/><p>But I know the reason\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026Sarasa-san, didn\u2019t you do quite a lot in the battle with Gabriel?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I tried to explain the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid quite a lot? That\u2019s not true. My best technique did not work at all after all.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. In the time when Celestis-chan was absent, Sarasa-san was the one who protected the Water capital. While she was away, the Demon Lord Gabriel appeared and, even when the difference in strength was overwhelming, Sarasa-san stepped ground until Celestis-chan arrived.</p><br/><p>This gained the respect of her junior Celestis-chan. On top of that, the technique that she showed at the end was sealed at the heroes match she had with Celestis-chan because it was too powerful, which also resonated within Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>Sarasa-san was turned into undiluted lifeforce after and has safely returned, but Celestis-chan has been sticking to her since then.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see Sarasa-oneesama in a new light!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan had her eyes sparkling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat strength of heart of not giving up in an incredibly disadvantageous situation! The amazingness of the last attack! Sarasa-oneesama is cool, I admire you!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>And so, in this way, Celestis-chan was respecting her like crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026I am happy that you respect me, but I am your senior here, so I would be glad if you had that respect from the very beginning though!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Completely true.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Celestis-chan can\u2019t hate the people that do good for the Water nation after all\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>She also has the trait that unless she doesn\u2019t find anything of value, she doesn\u2019t even try to act as if she respects you though.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd when she judges you as someone good, she doesn\u2019t show any restrain in her show of affection. Truly someone that doesn\u2019t have openings!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan, who was by my side, was half in admiration and half tired by this.</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan then once again buries deeper into Sarasa-san\u2019s bossom and says with a low but clear voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, thank you, Sarasa-oneesama. For protecting my beloved city. The people that I love. If you hadn\u2019t been there, if you hadn\u2019t done your all to protect them until I arrived, by now, they would have all been\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-san\u2026\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! I thought of something nice! When I graduate from being a hero, can I join Sarasa-sama\u2019s family?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that way, I can truly become Sarasa-oneesama\u2019s sister after all!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>An outrageous proposal fitting of Celestis-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGyaaa!! Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t! If you were to join my family, after retiring from your title as hero, you will have the position of being the daughter of the current Founder. I will be the one who will be losing my position in the family!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>For Sarasa-san, the current Celestis-chan was actually even more of a threat than the past one.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh well, it is good that they get along with each other\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>And seeing this, Mirack-chan immediately gave up on thinking anymore.</p><br/><p>I also did the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t this the very view of culture?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c?\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>There was one other person watching the bantering of the water heroes along with Mirack-chan and I. That person is\u2026uhm, the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have learned one other thing about culture. With this battle, I have learned that the source of culture is, in other words, love!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cLoving others and holding the will of making others love you; in order to express this, you bring out a variety of knowledge and put it into action. That itself is culture! In order to get culture into my hands, I should learn about love first and master it!!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u2026Is what the Water Demon Lord is saying.</p><br/><p>Even though the battle is already over, this Demon Lord still hasn\u2019t left.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! You said some nice things there, Demon Lord!! In that case, to learn about love, you have to act first!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>And Celestis-chan speaks to the Demon Lord as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>It was as if she had already let it be water under the bridge. In a sense, you could call that the respect Celestis-chan had for words of the Water God she loves.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, there\u2019s the need to act or nothing can be obtained! In order to obtain love, what should you do?!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, to declare your love to the one you love! That act is the most simple of cultures! You try shouting it as well, Sarasa-oneesama, I love you!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cSarasa-oneesama, I love you!!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeeeeeh?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Sarasa-san herself was the most shocked one.</p><br/><p>My condolences.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext is a hug! It is fine. Sarasa-oneesama is benevolent, so she will even accept a Demon Lord!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cSarasa-oneesama, I love you~!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Gabriel approaches with both arms open and, obviously, Sarasa-san\u2019s red alert was sounding.</p><br/><p>At this point, I can\u2019t tell if Celestis-chan is being serious here or this is just plain bullying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa-Wait! Wait for a bit! \u2026No, if I run away here, it would be a disgrace! Let it be my junior or a Demon Lord, I will accept them both! Come at meeeee!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Ah, she accepted it.</p><br/><p>In this case, I think that Sarasa-san\u2019s benevolence like that of the mother ocean has only worsened the situation.</p><br/><p>\u2026Well, it is good that they are getting along.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s give up thinking.</p><ul><li>320: Fire\u2019s sworn friend</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cGugagagaga! Wait, as I thought, the Demon Lord\u2019s strength is totally different from humans. The bones in my whole body will break! Can you please hold back a little?! My insides will come out!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s leave aside Sarasa-san who is supposed to be in cloud nine for being hugged by her little sisters.</p><br/><p>My attention switched to the other one, the giant that towered on us.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The four Demon Lords that\u2026are supposed to threaten this world. The one that stands as their leader.</p><br/><p>Michael was standing there with arms crossed and showing a complicated expression. He had both eyes closed as if in silent prayer.</p><br/><p>It was as if he were sleeping, but at the same time, it looked like he was a philosopher contemplating.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You are not returning either?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The one who brought the topic was Mirack-chan who exchanged fists with Michael before.</p><br/><p>The Fire Demon Lord slowly opens his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Gabriel in that state\u2026 She said she won\u2019t be returning until she obtains the human\u2019s culture\u2026\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>At the other side, there\u2019s Gabriel and Celestis-chan hugging the passed out Sarasa-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cI as well, even if it was in order to save a comrade, I ended up joining forces with the humans that I am originally meant to eradicate. Thinking about what Uriel and Raphael will say to that, it makes it harder to return.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also things the Demon Lords can get awkward about?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan said it as if she was joking, but Michael is always super serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can be considered to be the heart in a way. What we monsters have recently obtained. But\u2026.it is not as if we have truly obtained it yet.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael flaps his fire wings slightly.</p><br/><p>One of the ashes that fell visibly turned bigger and changes into a wolf with fire fur.</p><br/><p>The most orthodox of the fire monsters, Hell Hound.</p><br/><p>Three fire wolves appeared at once and it caught the eye of us who were right at the vicinity.</p><br/><p>They were growling \u2018Grrrr!\u2019 and, with those instincts pushing them, it felt as if they would attack us at any moment.</p><br/><p>But when Michael raised his hand to gesture them to stop, the fire wolves obey like obedient dogs.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of a Demon Lord. You can even control the instincts of monsters to attack humans and have them obey huh.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, monsters attack humans. They attack and try to kill. That is the nature that\u2019s been edged in all monsters. There\u2019s no other way to call it but an instinct.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael says this as he looks at the kinfolks he himself created.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t even be called an instinct. It is a function. Monsters don\u2019t attack humans out of hatred or sense of duty, it is not because of the vulgar excitement that comes from destruction either, neither is it because of the survival instincts that kick in when animals attack other animals\u2026 Monsters simply have the function of attacking humans.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>His explanation felt as if it carried pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could say we Demon Lords have escaped from that root and have obtained a heart. I won\u2019t let anyone deny that. Like hell I would let anyone\u2026\u2026 But all monsters aside from us are still moving under that function that fakes their state as lifeforms.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cKatack Mirack, what you said in the past about \u2018Monsters not having emotions\u2019, I still haven\u2019t been able to turn it around. As long as that isn\u2019t done, monsters not only won\u2019t be able to stand as the summit of all races, we won\u2019t even be able to stand as a lifeform at all.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael bends his knees and strokes the head of the fire wolf he had created.</p><br/><p>If this were a normal dog, it would be waving his tail and might even return the act by licking the hand of the person.</p><br/><p>But the fire wolves didn\u2019t react even when being petted.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026In the end, Gabriel and I have the same opinion. In order for monsters to obtain their position as a new lifeform, we need to mix with humans, and learn from them. That\u2019s the surest way to reach that goal. By doing that, these guys might one day be able to feel happy at their comrades increasing in numbers.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s nice!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I unconsciously raised my voice.</p><br/><p>Michael and Mirack-chan turned their gaze towards me at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we humans and monsters stop fighting and get along, we can learn the good things about each other and be able to grow together! It is definitely a LOT better than fighting until one side perishes!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael immediately denies that possibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe monsters and humans have to fight in order to decide who is the most fitting ruler in this world. Until either side falls.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! Who decided something like that?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Great Demon Lord, Lucifer-sama.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Those words were proclaimed from the mouth of Michael. An impressive-sounding name like that. A name I have heard before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Lord that rules over us Demon Lords, the Demon Lord of Demon Lords; the one who is the ruler of all monsters in the true meaning, the Light Demon Lord.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Light\u2026Demon Lord?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a light element Demon Lord?</p><br/><p>And that Demon Lord is the boss of all of them?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Light Demon Lord you speak about, you are saying he is the very culprit scheming the eradication of humans?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat. So in the end, the most evil one of them all was the one related to Karen-chi?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Being tired of mushing Sarasa-san, Celestis-chan joins in on our conversation.</p><br/><p>Or more like, I don\u2019t know about this, you know?! Being the same element doesn\u2019t mean we are related, okay?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we were still inside our mothers, Lucifer-sama spoke to us.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Gabriel was carrying the foaming Sarasa-san as she came towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Eradicate the humans, the rulers of the world are us monsters\u2019. Obeying those words, we four Demon Lords gathered and decided on fighting the humans.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cLucifer-sama hasn\u2019t reached perfect shape yet and is currently in sleep. Once Lucifer-sama is born, it will be the true end of humanity.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>I felt a chill run down my spine.</p><br/><p>Even though we have grown close enough with the Demon Lords to speak with them in this way, you are telling me the direction to destruction has not been averted at all?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now, I can\u2019t help but have doubts to Lucifer-sama. I understood for the first time after fighting. Humans are living beings that surpassed my expectations by a lot. It is not solely from strength. The humans definitely hold an unknown power that is hard to even describe in words.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be talking about culture and love!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd those might actually be only a part of what tremendous thing the humans hold. For monsters, even if humans are enemies, they hold something that we require. I have to face Lucifer-sama. I have to ask him something.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Hearing what the Demon Lords had to say, we thought that they were incredible.</p><br/><p>They are desperately thinking about their way of living. I even ended up thinking that passing our days carefreely is embarrassing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhichever the case, nothing will begin unless Lucifer-sama wakes up though.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Michael nods at the words of Gabriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Right now we simply wait for the right time.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Meaning that peace will continue until that Lucifer-san awakens? Or more like, the true hell will begin once he awakens\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026how about we all attack that Lucifer guy while he is still sleeping?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, read the mood a bit.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>It looks like even Celestis-chan didn\u2019t think that was a really decent proposition. She soon closed her mouth when Mirack-chan scolded her.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-sama! Also, the heroes from the other churches!\u201d</p><br/><p>A member of the Water Church calls us at that moment. This is Hydra Ville after all.</p><br/><p>But why did he call us in such a hurried voice?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a report from the Stream Marine corps. There is an unknown something heading towards the city!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unknown something?</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. This Hydra Ville has just overcome a conflict not that long ago, you know? It is troubling to be constantly shot in such a brief period of time, geez!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s the need to deal with the thing that is coming. Since we are here, let\u2019s help out as well. Let\u2019s finish this quickly.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>I was also completely in agreement to Mirack-chan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s have the knocked out Sarasa-san rest for now, and so\u2026the other one\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Doraha?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Being asked by Mirack-chan, I silently shook my head to the sides.</p><br/><p>Doraha-san fought together with us against Gabriel, and she hasn\u2019t healed completely from the damage she took and is still bedridden.</p><br/><p>The wounds themselves have been treated with water techniques though. However, maybe because she used power that surpassed her limits, she is still sleeping like a log.</p><br/><p>She is not in a state where she can participate in battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Whichever the case, she has done plenty work already. Let her rest.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she weren\u2019t there at that time, the Water Church would have been done for after all. We have to at least gift her a good sleep!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>And so, Mirack-chan, Celestis-chan, and I will be dealing with this unknown situation.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the two Demon Lords heard the report and raised their senses as if checking for the presence, and they both turned their head and the same direction at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This divine power\u2026\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cUriel? Why is that guy coming here?\u201d (Gabriel)</p><ul><li>321: The fear of the Demon Lord</li></ul><br/><p>According to the lookouts of Hydra Ville, an unknown \u2018something\u2019 was letting out an overwhelming amount of divine power as it headed straight towards them.</p><br/><p>Predicting the course it will take, we wait for the arrival of that \u2018something\u2019 at the easiest place to fight off someone; at the plains.</p><br/><p>It is pretty faraway from the city, so there\u2019s no worries even if we were to rampage quite a bit.</p><br/><p>But what worried me more was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Uhm\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Michael and Gabriel came along with us as well.</p><br/><p>These two, along with Mirack-chan, Celestis-chan, and I.</p><br/><p>It is an abnormal grouping.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is quite the bizarre group of people.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I understand why Celestis-chan is making a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I stay with you people, I can meet more new culture! I -Gabriel- am the type that doesn\u2019t let go of a learning experience!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The one heading here is probably a guest of ours. Then, it is manners for us to be the ones meeting him.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Gabriel says with half amusement, while Michael seems to have felt something.</p><br/><p>What is coming here anyways?</p><br/><p>We could confirm that something was making a dust cloud as it headed to where we were. It is on a level where you would think a stampede is heading our way. Moreover, that dust cloud is still quite far away from us, and yet, we could feel a presence even from where we were.</p><br/><p>How to say it, it felt as if it were hurried, or desperate?</p><br/><p>I could feel that from the something that is making that dust cloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is obvious but, it is steadily coming here.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like we will soon be able to confirm with our eyes. Just who is it that is making that dust cloud?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>When we strain our eyes, we were finally able to pick up who the one making that dust cloud was.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cUriel?!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the four Demon Lords threatening the world, Earth Demon Lord, Uriel!</p><br/><p>That figure of his, that is like a tree taking the form of a human, there\u2019s no way of mistaking it. There\u2019s branches drawing the silhouette of wings spreading from his back which is a trait of that Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Gabriel, Michael, and now there\u2019s Uriel; are you telling me three of the four Demon Lords will be grouping in this Hydra Ville?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of my sightseeing city. Even Demon Lords want to check it out at least once.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is no time to be throwing jokes, Celestis-chan!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Leaving aside the two here, the other Demon Lords are still hostile towards humans.</p><br/><p>If Uriel arrives here, at worst, it might become a battle with Hydra Ville\u2019s safety at stake!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t trouble the humans.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael says softly but with a clear tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like he has business with me.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael~~!! Michael Michael Michael Michael Michael Michael Michael!!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>The Earth Demon Lord repeatedly calls the name of his comrade Michael.</p><br/><p>And then, he arrived here. With the speed he used to create that dust cloud, he charges at Michael.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael~~~~!!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>And then, he clings onto the legs of Michael.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael!! Save me, Michael! Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me!!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Oi, what\u2019s the matter, Uriel? Why is a Demon Lord like you making such an unsightly scene like this?!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Even Michael was unable to hide his confusion and was looking at his comrade that had fallen into panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me, save me, save me! Save m\u2014*cough *cough *cough! At any rate, save me!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>Why is this Demon Lord-san so scared?</p><br/><p>When talking about Demon Lords, aren\u2019t their existences the very definition of fearsome?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t hurry, that person will come! That person is\u2026!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person?\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Uriel\u2019s ominous words made us move our gazes towards the route he came from before, and there was someone there already.</p><br/><p>A peerless beauty shouldering a big scythe.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2026think this is the first time I have seen this person.</p><br/><p>Because if I saw her once, I would definitely not forget about her. That\u2019s the kind of beauty level she had.</p><br/><p>In terms of age, I would say she is slightly above us, around 18 years old, maybe?</p><br/><p>Even so, she had a liveliness similar to that of a child, and was accompanied with the contradictory feeling of composure of that of an adult.</p><br/><p>Her boobs are also incredibly big.</p><br/><p>Even as a person of the same gender, her beauty made me let out a gasp.</p><br/><p>Just who in the world is she?</p><br/><p>\u201cGyaaaaaa!! She is hereeeee!!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>And Uriel let out a scream at that beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying about that human woman?! Ah?!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>The moment Michael let out that question, the beauty had already closed in on him.</p><br/><p>When did she manage to do that?!</p><br/><p>That speed of hers, not even I\u2026no, not even we all here were able to catch it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael?!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Michael and Gabriel barely managed to react to it and attack the mysterious beauty.</p><br/><p>Michael with a punch clad in fire, Gabriel with a high pressure water bullet; they are both divine power attacks that surpass the level of humans by a whole lot, but the mysterious beauty didn\u2019t flinch at either.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>She deflected the water bullet, and then, the swung big scythe cuts off the right arm of Michael?!</p><br/><p>What in the world! She was able to deal with two Demon Lords at once so easily?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay, Michael?!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael quickly falls back and sticks his arm back in place.</p><br/><p>Being able to bring it back to normal after such a big wound is proof of the fearsomeness of a Demon Lord, but the mystery woman-san is actually scarier right now!</p><br/><p>\u201cHiih! Not even Michael is any good. What in the world should we do?!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this, Uriel?! What in the world is that human?!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Now that it has come to this, there\u2019s no room for doubt. The one who has made Uriel lose all his pride as a Demon Lord was that mysterious beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, this situation\u2026 What should we do?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, who is that beautiful lady?! Human? Monster? I can\u2019t even tell that!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan were flustered completely.</p><br/><p>No, that lady is most likely a human, but that strength makes it questionable whether she actually is a human!</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026Hah\u2026! I finally caught up!!\u201d</p><br/><p>That voice\u2026Haine-san?!</p><br/><p>The third intruder from the route where Uriel and the mysterious beauty came from. It is Haine-san who had been missing these last few days!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san! Where were you until now?! Or more like, what\u2019s with this situation?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Haine-san was most likely desperately chasing after Uriel and the mysterious beauty. His flying machine was overheated and smoke was coming out from it here and there.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-T-That\u2019s Sasae-chan\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chan turned into a God Hero. Mantle\u2026overdid it\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>No no, what are you saying, Haine-san?</p><br/><p>The Sasae-chan that should be in Ishtar Blaze, there\u2019s no way she would be here!</p><br/><p>In the first place, there\u2019s nothing resembling Sasae-chan with this person here!</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Could it be\u2026that familiar big scythe that looks as if it would hunt down lives that this beauty is holding\u2026the Earth Scythe, Sita.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat incredible beauty is the God Hero Sasae-chan?!\u201d (Karen)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-317-318-earth-god-hero\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 317-318 - Earth God Hero\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-322-324-the-successor-of-%E2%80%98by-the-roots%E2%80%99\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 322-324 - The successor of \u2018By the roots\u2019\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236376\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

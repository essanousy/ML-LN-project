A hero only moves forward!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSis Kyouka?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The previous fire hero Abi Kyouka-san has appeared in the battlefield?!</p><br/><p>No, wait\u2026 I can see other people as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing a monster, mah old blood be boiling~. I can\u2019t just stay put anymore.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy contributing in this monster subjugation, I can at least cleanse a bit of the shame I have faced today.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The previous earth hero, Yoneko-san, and the previous water hero, Sarasa-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoneko-neechan, why ya came here-dasu?! Did ya leave the baby ta Sobo-chan again-dasu ka?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were also heroes and we been given back our divine tools for today, so not doing anything ain\u2019t gonna look good~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, we will be joining in on this fight as well. Let\u2019s go! May the Fire God Nova bestow us victory!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cMother Earth Mantle-sama, bless us with bountiful strength~!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>They rush towards the Slime.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, their juniors get incredibly flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaa!! Sis, wait! Seriously, wait!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Slime melts all that it gulps down-dasu yo! If ya challenge it in close combat, ya all gonna be left without even bones-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Each one of them jumps at their respective Senpai to stop them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Why do the former heroes only know of charging forward?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan and I were looking at this from the flying machine.</p><br/><p>\u201cFufufu\u2026 As expected of the heroes of other churches. They are all lacking neurons.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The previous water hero, Sarasa-san.</p><br/><p>She walks forward triumphantly with her folding fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water folding fan has been fixed and is right back in action. If we can\u2019t get close, then it is all about long-ranged attacks. My \u2018Water Blade\u2019 is right in that alley!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>A high water pressure blade was released from the folding fan. This hit the giant Slime as if it were natural, and it disappeared as if natural.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust saying but, that water steam bun is earth element. You and I are completely useless against it.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just way too harsh!!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Being informed of this by Celestis, Sarasa weeps.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Water Blade\u2019 that was blocked, broke into several droplets, and fell onto the lava moat, making *fsst* fsst* sounds.</p><br/><p>Those were the sounds of the water being instantly evaporated by the lava. And that evaporation made the lava fly around here and there.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa! Dangerous! Seriously, why did you people even come here for?! \u2026Wait!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the matter? It looks like Celestis-chan noticed something.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This might actually work. [Big Water Blade]!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It was sudden.</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan released a big amount of water into the lava moat, and just like the time with the \u2018Water Blade\u2019, it made an ear-piercing sound and lava flew around.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa?! What\u2019s wrong, Celestis?! What are you trying to pull?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lava we went through the trouble of creating gonna get cooled and return to being stone-dasu yo! Celestis-neechan, just because yer useless, yer lashing out of jealousy-dasu ka?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way that\u2019s the case. Celestis is a smart girl. There\u2019s definitely a reason behind this!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it! When lava gets colder, it doesn\u2019t return to being stone! It turns into glass!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d \u201cNa-dasu?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The words of Celestis-chan made Mirack-chan and Sasae-chan wide eyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe soil around here apparently has a lot of quartz that serves as a material to make glass. By making it into muddy lava and cooling it, it turns into glass!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Well, it is natural glass, so in more exact terms, it would be obsidian though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the idiot Sarasa threw water into the lava, I noticed it! Even when glass is soaked in acid, it won\u2019t melt. It might be the same for that Slime!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see!\u201d \u201cDasu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, create more lava! I will cool it down and make glass! We will create a gigantic glass wall with that and stand in its way!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan is smart!</p><br/><p>But will it really go so smoothly?</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chi, use your earth element to \u2018Transmute\u2019 the earth and make it easier to turn into glass! It will make the burden on you bigger, but I can count on you, right?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Celestis, even with us three, no matter how much we do our best, there\u2019s no way we will be able to create glass big enough to stop the path of that giant Slime! There\u2019s no time to manage it!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it be possible? Because you know, there\u2019s one more set of fire, water, and earth heroes after all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cEh?\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyouka-san, Sarasa-san, and Yoneko-san were confused.</p><br/><p>Looks like they took some time to notice that it referred to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t joke around! Doesn\u2019t that mean we would have to match our divine power like you people in order to utilize that technique?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna do that~. Holding hands with this person!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>In order to create lava, there\u2019s the need to combine fire and earth divine power.</p><br/><p>It is necessary for Kyouka-san and Yoneko-san to cooperate.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>With Hyue-chan still riding at my back on the flying machine, I requested this of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople are in danger here! It has nothing to do with the Church or the matter of current and previous heroes, this is for the sake of saving people! Please lend us your strength!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyouka-san and Yoneko-san, the two of them were looking at each other displeased, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHm! We lost today! That\u2019s why, for today only, we will stand by your ideals!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Since I became a mother, mah spirit has become brittle~. That city has lotsa parents and children in it too!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>Both hands were linked.</p><br/><p>At the same time as Mirack-chan and Sasae-chan who are in the same position\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! Don\u2019t get so close to me, it is just fine to hold hands, right?! Why is there the need to stick our body together?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cause yer boobs are gigantic~! With things that big, they will definitely hit somewhere! If ya have such splendid things here, ya should just have babies and give \u2018em their proper use~!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we are talking about big, that goes for both of us! \u2026Damn it, earth divine power is seriously pouring inside my body. What\u2019s with this strange sensation?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t just divine power, yer heart be also pouring into me~! Fer someone that only spits poison from that mouth, yer crazy worried about yer junior fire hero all the time!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it out from your mouth! You as well, aren\u2019t you thinking of that shrimp earth hero as if she were your actual little sister! You are thinking at the bottom of your heart about knitting new clothes for her!!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Uwa!</p><br/><p>The two of them are mixing their divine power while fighting!</p><br/><p>They were heroes in the past and quite the excelling ones at that. Their control in divine power might even be better than our current selves.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not the only thing at play here.</p><br/><p>In today\u2019s match, it wasn\u2019t only the bonds between the current and previous heroes that grew stronger, the bonds within the group of previous heroes has also grown stronger \u2014even if their mouths don\u2019t say the same\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c[Magma Ocean]!!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>A torrent of lava gushes forth from two locations.</p><br/><p>One side was letting out more lava than the other, but even so, it was plenty enough!</p><br/><p>It all spreads around as if surrounding the giant Slime.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenpai, this time it is our turn! The earth heroes have \u2018Transmuted\u2019 it to make it easier to turn it into glass, so it is fine for us to just cool it real good!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go ordering me! This time for sure, I will restore my honor! Full power [Big Waterfall]!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The large amounts of water that Celestis-chan and Sarasa-san released were cooling the lava.</p><br/><p>Water steam was raising densely.</p><br/><p>As that happened, the Slime was slowly approaching.</p><br/><p>If it passes before they are finished, it will be too late. Please, make it in time!!</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I be leaving it ta ya-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>At the next instant, at Sasae-chan\u2019s feet, the Goddess Golem appears.</p><br/><p>It is the same one that she showed at her match with Yoneko-san.</p><br/><p>The Goddess Golem, as if following the will of Sasae-chan, digs its hand onto the ground and lifts up the volcanic glass that has been cooled down and hardened.</p><br/><p>How to say it, it was like a puddle of water that had been frozen in winter.</p><br/><p>That giant glass wall hit the Slime just like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did it! It doesn\u2019t melt!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Just as Celestis-chan thought, the Slime gulped down the giant glass and tried to melt it, but it looks like it isn\u2019t working as it wants.</p><br/><p>Due to the fruitless efforts it was making, its advance stops.</p><br/><p>We finally managed to stop the movements of the Slime.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a chance, Hyue-chan! Let\u2019s go!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>This time it is our turn to move.</p><ul><li>211: One Stroke Bisection</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cHyue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wa?!</p><br/><p>A ghost from behind us!</p><br/><p>Is what I thought, but it is the proxy wind hero, Brastor Juo-san, who was at some point in time standing behind us\u2026in midair?!!</p><br/><p>Her exclusive weapon, that wind gun rebellion of hers, had several of its spheres with ropes hanging down from them, and these ropes were tied like a swing, which Juo is sitting on. What a cute way of flying, but combined with those looks, it is still terrifying!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what did you come here for?! We are in a fight with the safety of the Wind at stake!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>As always, Hyue-chan was incredibly aggressive towards her senior.</p><br/><p>That reason had been established not that long ago, but because of it, our suspicions of you being a bro-con are growing dangerous, Hyue-chan!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can understand the gist of what you people are trying to do.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut using your wind gun to pour ultrasound to the target\u2019s whole body\u2026would take time. It is inefficient.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about it?! Even if that\u2019s the case, we have no choice but to do it!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already positioned several of my wind spheres\u2026around the Slime. If I have them all release ultrasound at the same time\u2026it will reach all the way to the Slimes very center.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cWaaa?!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>It is true that there\u2019s several spheres of that wing gun rebellion, and if they were to all release ultrasound at the same time, it would be a lot faster than Hyue-chan who only has one wind gun.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue, you concentrate on picking up the echoes of the ultrasound that come back. You who use the wind long gun are better at looking and listening.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cGuh\u2026But why is a work hater like you doing this?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also a resident of the Wind. I can\u2019t just not do anything when the Wind capital is in danger. The people of that city that Shiva-sama loves\u2026I also love them.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis woman\u2026\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Call me Sister-in-law.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell I will, damn woman!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Why are these two in such a bad relationship?!</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t they get along like Yorishiro-sama and I who are in a triangle relationship like them?!</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now we are in an emergency! Let\u2019s ride on that plan of yours!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare quick. I am already ready to activate them at any time.\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Being urged by Juo-san, Hyue-chan presses her wind gun Koumei onto her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere it goes\u2026 Wind Gun Rebellion technique, [Tengu Cry]!\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t hear anything.</p><br/><p>Ultrasounds are high wind waves that the human eardrums can\u2019t pick up, and those travel through the wind to the body of the Slime, reverberate inside it, and then the sound bounces back out of the Slime\u2019s body and passes to where we are.</p><br/><p>Of course, the bounced back sound isn\u2019t something that a human would be able to hear either, so I can\u2019t tell.</p><br/><p>But if it\u2019s the wind hero Hyue-chan, by controlling the wind divine power, she can feel the vibrations of the wind that would normally be impossible to feel, and can manage to sense the slight differences in the waves that came from the insides of the Slime.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014I have heard it!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan took a stance with her wind gun\u2026and shoots.</p><br/><p>*Bang!* *Bang!*</p><br/><p>Due to the elemental advantage, the wind bullet opened two big holes into the Slime\u2019s surface.</p><br/><p>Two holes that line up vertically.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose holes are a mark! If you cut those two holes as if you were to tie them together, you can cut down the core inside the Slime in two!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Hyue-chan!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Jumping off my flying machine at the same time as I give her my thanks, I land on the ground. And just like that, I brandish my holy sword, Saint-George.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment\u2026cut it, how? The \u2018Holy Light Blade\u2019 of the light hero would take its all just trying to cut its surface\u2026..\u201d (Juo)</p><br/><p>Juo-san points this out in worry.</p><br/><p>Her worry is logical but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up and watch, Juo. Karen-dono has an ace up her sleeve!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Everyone did their best to make the preparations.</p><br/><p>From the very beginning, my job was to deal the finishing blow.</p><br/><p>Even I have been growing as a hero as time went on. Just like how Mirack-chan gave birth to that \u2018Fire Blade\u2019 technique.</p><br/><p>I also have a technique that I came up with after training with everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly sword that holds the title of Dragon Slayer!! Utilize my light divine power and become a sword column!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The holy sword Saint-George, that I held up as if piercing the heavens, had begun to shine, and light divine power was released at the same direction the sword was pointing.</p><br/><p>It was as if the blade had stretched several tens of times longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the\u2026light hero\u2019s \u2018Holy Light Line\u2019?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why is she releasing it up?!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Seeing the light I released, Kyouka-san and Sarasa-san were flustered.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not it. This is not \u2018Holy Light Line\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Holy Light Line\u2019 is a shooting technique that is released at the enemy. Due to the trail running from the blade, it looks as if the blade had extended, but in reality, it is not as if it actually did.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what Karen-chi is doing is different. She has shot a more dense and stable light divine power, and is actually making a giant \u2018Light Sword\u2019!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It is just as Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan explained.</p><br/><p>The current holy sword that has been made a giant light sword has truly become that and is maintaining its form as a giant blade.</p><br/><p>This is my new technique that I created with the help and training with everyone.</p><br/><p>If it is with this giant light sword, I can slice this giant Slime in two.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Holy Light Bisection]!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The light giant sword is swung down.</p><br/><p>At an angle that properly aligns to the two holes that Hyue-chan opened, it enters the body of the Slime as it slices it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi oi, with that\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be slicing that giant water steam bun in two!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Just slicing it in two is not enough.</p><br/><p>Even if the liquid body of the Slime were to be cleanly cut in two, it would soon stick back together and return to how it was before.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I have to aim for the core that Hyue-chan and Juo-san have sounded out and cut it with pinpoint accuracy.</p><br/><p>This is a single stroke that was created in order to reach all the way in its insides. But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKugh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>No good. I can\u2019t stop the \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019 from dispersing.</p><br/><p>In order to create a giant blade, there\u2019s the need of a massive amount of divine power, and the stronger the release, the more violent is the dispersion of it.</p><br/><p>I have to fix that problem or I won\u2019t be able to call this \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019 as a perfected technique. I still haven\u2019t mastered my control in divine power to that point yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, it really wasn\u2019t mastered yet?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>At this rate, the blade will disappear before it arrives at the core! What should I do\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief. What a flashy girl you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The convergence strength of the \u2018Holy Light Bisection\u2019 has suddenly increased?!</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>When I glance at my back for a moment, there\u2019s the previous light hero, Sunnysol Ates-sama there?!</p><br/><p>She is holding the handle of the holy sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take the job of maintaining the form of the light sword. You concentrate on increasing the output.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>With the help of Ates-sama, the light sword has become stable!</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>No, this is everyone\u2019s fight.</p><br/><p>Right now, I have to throw away personal issues.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaaaaah!!\u201d (Karen+Ates)</p><br/><p>The light sword was swung all the way down.</p><br/><p>\u2026But it was suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>The Slime was sliced in two, and yet, it feels as if something or someone is grabbing ahold of the giant light sword!!</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-207-209-slime\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 207-209 - Slime\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-212-213-the-demon-lord-appears\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 212-213 - The Demon Lord appears\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236332\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

With that measly light power of yours, it will be caught by the gravity barrier, and won\u2019t reach the Black Hole\u2019s core.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Even though I heard that darkness is the only method to go against darkness!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only Black Hole you have seen must have been the one at Ishtar Blaze that erased Mantle, right?!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Black Hole that\u2019s being created by Lucifer right now is on a different level from that one. It is a standard Black Hole. It is the original scale used to destroy the world, that is.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Destroying\u2026the world\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the true purpose of a Black Hole. And yet, that personage was so attached to this world that he only used the minimum size of the Black Hole when creating it\u2026 How saddening.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates\u2019 expression distorts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat personage that holds the ultimate power in the world had restricted his own almightiness for the sake of stupid living beings like humans. To not be able to use his all as he wished. Just by looking at that point, you humans are all sinful!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>She directed a gaze filled with hatred.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s all over now. I was thinking of playing around with you all before crushing you, but I don\u2019t feel like it anymore. Disappear inside the Black Hole altogether with the world!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis-chan refutes as if biting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe know about your objective! In order to live eternity together with your beloved Dark God, you wanted to create a new world with that Lucifer, and shut inside there with only you two, right?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Ignoring the other party\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>That may simply be how the wicked Light Goddess does things though.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, as long as you create the new world, there\u2019s no need to care about the old world. The existence of this world should have nothing to do with your objective! How about just leaving us alone and you go to your Eden?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates promptly denies her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor me, destroying this world holds as much priority as making Lucifer into a new world.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou paltry humans, when moving to another house, you would clean the old house, right? After refreshing yourself in this way, you can move to your new home with a clear mind, right? It is the same as that.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Old house\u2026cleaning?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou humans are the trash that deceived my beloved Dark God. There\u2019s the need to erase every single speck of trash. Without doing that, that personage wouldn\u2019t be able to cut ties with his old world, and my revenge wouldn\u2019t dissipate.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis woman!! What crazy stuff is she spewing!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, who knows what the four Base Elements and the other Inflation would do if left alone. It is fine to just erase them together with this world. And then, after squaring all accounts, Entropy and I can fully enjoy our own Eden.\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>This person\u2026this God\u2026is crazy!!</p><br/><p>As long as she and her loved one are there, there\u2019s no need for anything more. No, there <i>cannot</i> be anything more.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why her ultimate selfishness of erasing everything without leaving anything behind is the worse kind of selfishness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, please properly disappear as well, okay? This is the order of the God that created you people. You will obviously obey, right?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe refuse!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you are a God, we will not allow you to decide our fate arbitrarily. There\u2019s no one but ourselves who can decide our own fate.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow selfish. Since when did humans become so prideful?\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the very beginning.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Since the moment the humans were born in this world by the hands of the Gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Gods that created us had blessed us humans. They acknowledged that we have splendid strength and potential. That blessing is the foundation of our pride.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>We have seen it.</p><br/><p>At that Underworld Country, when we went to the consciousness world, we experienced the Genesis era with our eyes, with our senses.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why we know.</p><br/><p>Since the very moment we humans were born, the Dark God was happier than anyone.</p><br/><p>And that God provided us with pride, blessings, potential, and also protected us from a variety of unfairness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe blessing that the Dark God gave to us humans, we ourselves can\u2019t put it to waste!! Doing that would mean betraying the Gods, and betraying ourselves!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cKh!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates\u2019 expression distorts into a scary countenance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtes! No, Wicked Light Goddess! Your actions itself are the same as stepping on the blessing of the Dark God and smearing mud at it! The one who goes against the Dark God the most is you! You are the one that\u2019s the furthest from the Dark God!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Someone like you\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t lose! As the children of the Gods!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed!\u201d \u201cJust as Karen-chi says!\u201d \u201cRight outta mah mouth-dasu!!\u201d \u201cSound reasoning!\u201d</p><br/><p>The heroes gathered here felt the same way as me.</p><br/><p>What we saw at the Underworld Country, it told us of our past history, as well as gave us pride.</p><br/><p>That pride pushed our retreating legs\u2026and made us walk forward.</p><br/><p>History. What we inherited from the past was granting us pride!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates was groaning silently.</p><br/><p>It was like a trembling that came from the bottom of the earth. A groan that came straight from hell.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe\u2026going against Entropy-sama? That I am the one that is the furthest from Entropy-sama, you say?!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates screamed like a vengeful ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have said what you shouldn\u2019t have! You mere humans, how dare you insult me, the Light Goddess!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not the true Light Goddess! The true Light Goddess is\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The one who has always been watching over us.</p><br/><p>The one who watched over us in place of the absent Dark God with regret that would drive her to tears.</p><br/><p>So pitiful, filled with deep love that would make you want to hug her; the true Light Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the sake of that person, I will defeat you! With the strength of everyone here!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Light!</p><br/><p>\u201cFire!\u201d \u201cWater!\u201d \u201cEarth-dasu!\u201d \u201cWind!\u201d</p><br/><p>A combined element mixing all five elements.</p><br/><p>With this concentration, we will crush Lucifer\u2019s darkness!</p><br/><p>\u201cFools! This is what you call getting way too ahead of yourselves! It is true that combining elements is an effective tactic. I will acknowledge that. But what point does it have in front of darkness!?!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates says with ridicule.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is presumptuous that humans are able to combine elements to create new ones which even Gods can\u2019t manage to, but\u2026no matter what combined element it is, it is powerless against darkness!! Just obediently get swallowed by the Black Hole!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not it.</p><br/><p>We know.</p><br/><p>When we learned of the beginning of the world, we had already learned that the Dark God was the very beginning of this world.</p><br/><p>That God was born first, and from that God himself, the idea of creating a world was reached.</p><br/><p>In order to create a world with bountiful colors, Entropy understood that just the black color wouldn\u2019t be enough. He separated himself in many parts, and created Gods aside from himself.</p><br/><p>That is the Light Goddess.</p><br/><p>Those are the Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind Gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we return the power of those Gods to one again\u2026!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>We five heroes with our five combined elements.</p><br/><p>Reaching out to the past, we learned of the answer, so we were able to find a path to this conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, everyone!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cYEAAAAH!!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201c-Dasu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Light; five elements combined\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cManifest! [Dark Matter]!!!\u201d</p><ul><li>402: Heroes of Darkness</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates saw the dark matter that we created and was shocked.</p><br/><p>From the hands that we five were holding, there was a dark swirl we were used to seeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDark matter?! The most precious and grand power\u2026to think that humans would be able to wield it!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Light; by combining all those elements, what comes after is \u2018Darkness\u2019.</p><br/><p>The world was born from darkness to begin with.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, if we were to put together everything that shapes this world, it will reach to the source that is darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t seen the beginning of the world, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to arrive to this power.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cControlling divine power comes from the image you have after all. Even if we were to mix five elements, if we can\u2019t imagine something clear coming out of it, we wouldn\u2019t have arrived at darkness!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did see the darkness of Haine-chi a number of times, but with only that, we would brush it off as just a phenomenon. There\u2019s no way we would be able to see through its true nature.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing the beginning of the world, we learned about how darkness gave everything to the world-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is exactly now that we have learned about how much the Dark God loved this world and its humans that we are able to use the darkness!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Dark matter comes out from us at an ever greater pace.</p><br/><p>By using this power, we can fight against Lucifer.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, everyone. Before Lucifer can finish the Black Hole, we will crush it with our darkness!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cYes!!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201c-Dasu!\u201d</p><br/><p>A torrent of dark matter comes from our linked hands.</p><br/><p>It was not inferior at all to the power that Haine-san normally wields.</p><br/><p>The black matter of Lucifer was already about to turn into a Black Hole.</p><br/><p>The gravity barrier it was creating was easily being negated by our dark matter wave, and got swallowed into the compressed core.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates\u2019 shrilling voice was proof enough that this was a valid tactic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwallowing all elements and erasing them; that\u2019s the first property of dark matter!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Haine-san\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what would happen if dark matter clashes?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t this be the first time it has happened in history?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Our dark matter against Lucifer\u2019s dark matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen a dark matter of a different party clashes, will they erase each other?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then that\u2019s fine! If we continue releasing dark matter, it would also mean that Lucifer won\u2019t be able to add more dark matter to finish the Black Hole-de gozaru!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>It is just as Hyue-chan says.</p><br/><p>For now, even if we are to drain ourselves, we have to continue releasing dark matter, and prevent Lucifer from finishing the Black Hole!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the Black Hole is finished, the world is done for! Think of this as us being in the brink of death and wring out all the strength you have!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Our darkness and Lucifer\u2019s darkness.</p><br/><p>The two darknesses are currently fighting each other, and it doesn\u2019t look as if either side is in an advantage, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFools! Lucifer\u2019s power is not only darkness!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Ates had regained her composure.</p><br/><p>\u201cLucifer is a perfect being that has obtained all elements. Moreover, its true essence is the Light Demon Lord! On top of that, the Light divine power is the only peerless way to defeat darkness!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Lucifer\u2019s light power, I will destroy your darkness!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>No good!</p><br/><p>If it does that, we will be pushed aside in an instant!</p><br/><p>But\u2026Lucifer\u2019s light attack didn\u2019t come no matter how long we waited.</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Tch! Can\u2019t do it. The darkness of Lucifer and the light would be coming from the same source. If it were to release a different power, the Black Hole Lucifer is forming would also be erased as well\u2026\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Darkness can\u2019t win against light.</p><br/><p>Looks like that law is working even inside Lucifer.</p><br/><p>And even if Ates were to use her light, at her range, it would simply be sucked into the Black Hole as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other four base elements as well can\u2019t be used while the dark power is activated?! Lucifer is supposed to be perfect, and yet, to think there was such a restriction to its powers\u2026!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because you got greedy and tried taking everything! You are definitely the type that would fail in a diet and get crazy fat instead!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>The strongest power in the world; darkness.</p><br/><p>The usage of it is, as expected, difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! Then, it is just a matter of pushing by force!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Lucifer stopped being at a loss and puts its all in pouring dark matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuaaaaaa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDasuuuuuu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The pressure we were receiving increased in an instant!!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven in a pure strength contest, it is impossible for a giant monster like Lucifer to lose against just five humans! Now then, let\u2019s wait until you people run out of steam!!\u201d (Ates)</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that the worse kind of situation?!</p><br/><p>A giant monster and humans. Even if we were to just include the stamina, we are all just girls in our teens! We don\u2019t hold that much stamina in ourselves!</p><br/><p>Our secret plan that\u2019s the dark matter, in the end, is only serving as buying time.</p><br/><p>Moreover, once our stamina is gone, we will be one-sidedly pushed.</p><br/><p>We have to think of a new plan, or things will just gradually worsen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Can you please\u2026leave it to me?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan?</p><br/><p>While continuing to release dark matter, Hyue-chan says this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it goes well, we could break this stalemate. Of course, to our advantage. Can you please believe in me?\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>I answered immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyue-chan is a splendid wind hero after all! If Hyue-chan says she has a good idea, it will definitely go well! Isn\u2019t that right?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s no ally I would trust as much with my back as Hyue after all!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this party, Hyue-chi is the second most intelligent after me! I will be looking forward to what you bring out!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave it ta Hyue-neechan-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Mirack-chan, Celestis-chan, and Sasae-chan also quickly decided on trusting her.</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan takes out some sort of cube embedded with what seems to be small jewels of different colors. Red, blue, yellow, green, and white.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hngh!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan released a great amount of wind divine power as if hardening her resolve.</p><br/><p>Then, she placed it at the hilt\u2019s side and somehow it stuck onto it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a device that came about from researching the jewels and Lucifer itself. It is still a prototype, but it allows the same ability to change an element to other elements. The conversion rate is not that good yet and requires a lot of energy to bring it to a decent output. But as God Heroes, it is at an useable level.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue began explaining as she finishes what seemed to be her pouring divine power to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now I have imbued as much wind divine power into the device as possible-de gozaru. The sync with other people is only required in the beginning of the combination, so as long as the element is present, you can still continue releasing it. With this, the five element combination will continue for a while more, and the dark matter won\u2019t be cut off for now!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning that, In that time, you will be settling your plan, right?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Hyue-chan silently nods, releases her hand, and flies off.</p><br/><p>The individual enterprise of the Wind God Hero, Hyue-chan, was about to begin.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-399-400-two-sides-unite\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 399-400 - Two sides unite\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-403-405-the-wind-of-rebirth\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 403-405 - The Wind of Rebirth\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236408\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

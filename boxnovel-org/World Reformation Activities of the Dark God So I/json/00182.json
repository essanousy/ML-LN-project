It was a shout that was close to a scream.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>[If the previous heroes win, all the current heroes and Founders will resign]</i>. It is just as it is written.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>The Light Founder, Yorishiro, speaks back with a carefree face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, in a sense, it was expected. The people that are utilizing the previous heroes are planning on stopping the young ones of the five Churches. It is a matter of course that they would take action towards the current heroes and the Founders that are pressing forward in their endeavour.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that as if it\u2019s nothing! Even you won\u2019t be able to stay as a Founder anymore, you know?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s only if Karen-san and the others lose though.</p><br/><p>The match that is supposed to take place today between the current heroes team and previous heroes team; it is something that originated due to the Hero Alliance that Karen-san was thinking of forming.</p><br/><p>A Hero Alliance that has the objective of having the heroes that have been against each other until now to cooperate with each other in order to defeat the monsters.</p><br/><p>That plan surpassed what the creator of that very idea -Karen-san- expected, and was about to develop into the main reason for the Churches itself to reconcile.</p><br/><p>However, when you want to change something that has existed for a long time, there will definitely be people who will oppose it.</p><br/><p>The measure that those people took was \u2018utilize the previous heroes\u2019.</p><br/><p>As they are the past heroes, their heads still have the confrontational ideologies of the past. On top of that, the current heroes are in a senior junior relationship with them which is a hard to explain factor. Meaning that, they are the worst kind of opponents.</p><br/><p>And so, it has been decided that the match will be taking place between the current heroes (the pro-reconciliation side) and the previous heroes (the contra-reconciliation side). That\u2019s today.</p><br/><p>The side that wins will shut up the side that loses; that\u2019s the kind of match it should have been. However, what was announced after the half a month of preparation was that the reward of the winner would be\u2026to put it in other words, the penalty of the defeated was so harsh it surpassed by a lot what I expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the case the previous heroes win, the current heroes and Founders will all resign.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san, Mirack, Celestis, Sasae-chan, and Hyue won\u2019t be able to stay as heroes. And Yorishiro will also be expelled from her position as Founder.</p><br/><p>The rules in this match were decided in a meeting with all the churches, and were settled with deliberation, apparently.</p><br/><p>Of course, the ones who came out with the crazy rule of \u2018everyone will resign\u2019 were no doubt the contra-reconciliation side.</p><br/><p>They proposed it and managed to push it through.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t this mean that the contra-reconciliation side one upped Yorishiro?!</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, Haine.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Saying so, the Wind Founder and Wind God, Toreido Shiva, pacifies me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think this woman is so cute as to get defeated right at the get go? \u2018Make them think they have won, and then have them walk the path of destruction\u2019, that\u2019s the most basic method of schemers.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, our political objective is to sniff out all the contra forces that are in the church without leaving a single one. In order to do that, there\u2019s the need to provide a delicious bait. So that even the last one hiding will want to come out from the shadows.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>The explanation of Shiva made Yorishiro go \u2018fufufu\u2019.</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s how it was?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the people that were raising a ruckus in the meeting were simply small fries. There\u2019s the need to drag the people, that control those small fries and the previous heroes, out from the shadows. In order to do that, I am willing to place my neck as the price.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was totally dragged into it though.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva clicked his tongue with an expression speaking a thousand complains, but Yorishiro simply smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the case, right? This time\u2019s plan benefits all the five Churches. People that try to pull the leg of the ones that are going to create ambitious feats can be found anywhere after all.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Wind Church is different from you guys\u2019 places; it is already united. Even in the reconciliation, there was not a single one who was against it!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>It is completely beside the point, but Shiva still snaps at the weirdest of places.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow now, don\u2019t be like that, Wind Founder.\u201d</p><br/><p>And another person speaks; the Earth Founder Oba-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cYa see, in mah place, everyone prostrated and implored me to become the Founder. In that way, ya could say that they all be a monolith. As a countryside, we really be enclosed, ya see. Even if we be told to suddenly get along with outside people\u2026I would want there to be one more push in order to convince them, ya know.\u201d (Oba-san)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you are saying this time\u2019s match will be the push that\u2019s needed?\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor that sake, I dragged out Yoneko by force after all.\u201d (Oba-san)</p><br/><p>The reason why the earth hero, that wasn\u2019t supposed to participate, is participating now is because of this person huh.</p><br/><p>The Water Founder joins.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is embarrassing to say, but our place is in the same state as the Light; a complete mess. Especially the household that Sarasa-san married into. It is an influential force in the financial world and are in a standing that makes it possible for them to aim for the standing of Water Founder. This one can\u2019t help but smell a conspiracy here.\u201d (Azul)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet there be hot-bloodedness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fire Founder is apologizing for the arbitrary actions of his disciple. Must be talking about the previous fire hero, Kyouka.</p><br/><p>In the end, a second Founders Conference is taking place today. Well, their own heads are at stake here, so it is a given.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>I already felt listless, so I turned on my heels.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, where are you going, Haine-san?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will check out on how Karen-san and the others are doing before the match.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>While I was in the middle of heading to the waiting room of Karen-san and the others, I met a familiar face.</p><br/><p>The Light Church\u2019s Aurora Knight corps General, Zeberfon Dobbe.</p><br/><p>He shows clear hostility every time we meet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou poisonous insect nesting in our church. It looks like today will be your death inauguration.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I remember the words of Yorishiro just a few moments ago.</p><br/><p>\u2018The people making a ruckus are all small fries\u2019 huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, the Light Church will return to its pure and glorious state. The Founder and hero that disturbs order like crazy will be gone, and the poisonous insect that is you will be eliminated. And then, the Light Church will regain its original form!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Did you finish the reformation plan that Yorishiro asked you to make?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?! \u2026\u2026\u2026.S-Something like that doesn\u2019t matter! The very person that ordered it will soon be kicked out from her position as Founder after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>He still hasn\u2019t done it yet?</p><br/><p>How much time do you think has passed since then. He truly is incompetent.</p><br/><p>The contra side. Without even trying to, I was able to actually feel its existence, and this time, I will be heading to the place where the people who will be fighting against them are.</p><ul><li>183: Waiting room -Current Heroes</li></ul><br/><p>How are the current heroes doing now that there\u2019s only one hour till the match begins?</p><br/><p>With the intentions of also encouraging them, I decided on checking out how they were doing in the waiting room where they were in standby at.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It was in a funeral state.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026\u2026what\u2019s with that? If we lose, the heroes are fired?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a variety show or something?! Don\u2019t go deciding so easily on the course of a hero~~!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis be the moment that one more anecdote will be added to my legend-dasu!! And yet, I didn\u2019t hear at all that Yoneko-neechan would be taking part too-dasu yo!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>If these heroes lose, they are fired.</p><br/><p>It looks like that reality had hit them harder than expected.</p><br/><p>Mirack, Celestis, and Sasae-chan were in an orz position on the floor and were not moving from there at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What\u2019s with you girls?! It hasn\u2019t been decided yet that you will be fired, right? It is fine if you just win!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say it as if it\u2019s easy, but it isn\u2019t!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack raged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is no boasting, but I haven\u2019t won a single time against Sis Kyouka before! And that shame of having my panties torn off every time I lost\u2014!! If she were to do that in the eyes of the public\u2026!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The heart of the fire hero was completely broken.</p><br/><p>A sister disciple relationship is truly troublesome huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, we have no choice but to fight.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san alone stout-heartedly cheered up everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like Yorishiro-sama said, this fight is an unavoidable fight that we must win in order to achieve our biggest objective. For the sake of eradicating monsters and leading the world into peace. Also, in order for our union to not be pointless, we can\u2019t run away. We have no choice but to win!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh~~\u2026..\u201d \u201cOooh~~\u2026..\u201d \u201cOoooh~\u2026.dasu\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no strength in the response!</p><br/><p>I am getting even more preoccupied?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry Karen-san. I would like to be of help here somehow but\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>And in reality, there\u2019s nothing I can do in this fight.</p><br/><p>As the incarnation of the Dark God, I have done my best to make the world a better place, but when it comes to official problems like this, I end up being powerless.</p><br/><p>But Karen-san is always positive.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is alright. This is fight that we heroes have to take ourselves. That\u2019s why we have to overcome it ourselves. Ates-san and the other previous heroes are basically the old conventions taking form to attack us. If we don\u2019t break through them, we won\u2019t be able to create a new system and era!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san was determined. That is the very form of the person that pulls the Hero Alliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-chi, if you want us to win no matter what, you can promise \u2018I will kiss you if you win\u2019 and Karen-chi\u2019s overall parameters will go up by three times more, you know?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Celestis who was prostrated on the floor in despair said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-chan, stop it! Haine-san, I am looking forward to it!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Which is it, Karen-san?</p><br/><p>But if this will only boost the motivation of Karen-san, the other four will still have their despairing state\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-chi, Mirack-chi, I have discovered something incredible.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen lying down on the floor like this, we can peek at Karen-chi\u2019s panties as much as we want.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Seriously?\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack, who was lying down depressed, was told this by Celestis who was lying face up on the floor and it made Mirack\u2019s mood slightly better.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san is wearing a skirt today.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, we are planning on moving a lot today, so I wore a shorts underneath my skirt. Don\u2019t go lying, Celestis-chan!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Karen-chi. Whether it is shorts or pantyless, it doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s romance in looking at the hidden domain that is the inside of a skirt.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>At any rate, it was already a mess.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s another person we can rely on, it would have to be\u2026the wind hero, Hyue. But where is she?</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t felt her presence for a while now though.</p><br/><p>I tried looking around, and I found her standing still at a corner of the room.</p><br/><p>It looks like she is cleaning her gun, En no Ozuno, and laughing \u2018kukuku\u2019. How scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Hyue? Why does she have such a horrifying atmosphere?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 She has been like this all this time since the names of our opponents were announced.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Names of the opponents?</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, there was an unfamiliar name in the previous wind hero line that I thought would be vacant.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026To think I would have the chance to kick the ass of that person in this kind of place.\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiih?!\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s wrong, Hyue-san?! You are scary!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>Hyue-san stands up proudly!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a battle that will decide the rise or fall of the Hero Alliance! In order to show our justice, let\u2019s do our best and slaughter all the annoying past heroes!!\u201d (Hyue)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cWe can\u2019t kill them, okay?!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>But the unexpected roar of Hyue had everyone retort.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Staying here in low spirits won\u2019t help at all.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is already our era. Let\u2019s teach that to Oba-san and the others.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cDefeat them before we get defeated-dasu! That be the survival of the fittest, that be the ironclad rule to survive in this world-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The three that were prostrated on the floor stand up with strength gathered in their limbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it, everyone! Let\u2019s show the previous heroes our strength!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san chimed last, and all five shouted in determination.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cOOOOOOOOHHHH!!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201c-DASU!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter what\u2019s said, they all have overcome many life-or-death situations together. Their teamwork is excellent.</p><br/><p>Worrying more than this would be unnecessary.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, I left just like that and decided on leaving it to them.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>This time, I really might end up simply watching.</p><br/><p>Those girls are strong. They should be able to overcome their own difficulties.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s obediently return to where the Founders are\u2026is what I thought but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought this, and yet, my legs were directed at a different direction.</p><br/><p>At the direction where the waiting room of the enemy of Karen-san and the others are, the previous heroes team.</p><ul><li>184: Waiting Room -Previous Heroes</li></ul><br/><p>Why did I come here?</p><br/><p>I think this as I stand in front of the door of the waiting room.</p><br/><p>Of course, even if I say waiting room, it isn\u2019t the waiting room of the current heroes team where I had visited Karen-san and the others just a few moments ago.</p><br/><p>It is the waiting room of the previous heroes that are the opponents in this match.</p><br/><p>Will this turn into an inspection of the enemy\u2019s movements?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s nothing I can gain from doing that, but as expected, I can\u2019t hold down the feeling that I want to do something for them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I breath deeply once, and knock on the door.</p><br/><p>A satisfying *knock, knock, knock* sound rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes~, you can enter~.\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard the voice of someone on the other side saying it is okay to enter, so I open the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for the intrusion~~.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>What welcomed me the moment I entered the room was\u2026a fully exposed breast.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>There was a woman that had a breast exposed in the waiting room.</p><br/><p>It is a person I have seen for the first time, and should be around her mid-twenties. It can be said to be the standard age of a previous hero but, why does she have a breast exposed?!</p><br/><p>\u2026Wait, there\u2019s a baby nibbling on that breast.</p><br/><p>I see, she is breastfeeding!</p><br/><p>Sorry for being occupied~. But babies don\u2019t care about the matters of adults, ya see~. When they hungry, they will make a ruckus, and I gotta bring out my breast~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-And who are you?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, excuse my rudeness. I be late in my introductions~. I be the previous earth hero, Iemon Yoneko.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>This person is\u2026the earth hero that came before Sasae-chan.</p><br/><p>Her whole body is well-rounded, and even though she is in her mid-twenties, she already has the atmosphere of a mother.</p><br/><p>She is always showing a happy-looking smile, and she actually looks more like Mother Earth than Mantle herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026sorry! I intruded while you were in the middle of something\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine~. Yer Haine-san, right? Sobo-chan told me that ya be the savior of Ishtar Blaze, and I can\u2019t neglect my respect~. Don\u2019t mind something like this. This little one be simply eatin\u2019 his meal~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>The spirit of a mother!</p><br/><p>R-Right. This is the meal of the baby, so the very thought of thinking about it in a perverted way is rude!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, uhm\u2026It was surprising that you would be participating in this occasion! I heard that you wouldn\u2019t be participating after all.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, when the notice of Sobo-chan came, it be just the time when this little one had been born, ya see. I lost all reason to refuse~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>The baby must have filled himself up. He lets go of his mouth. Yoneko-san covers her breast with practiced hand, and makes the baby let out a burb.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, she is the cousin of Sasae-chan. In that case, the \u2018Sobo-chan\u2019 she is talking about must be the same as Sasae-chan, the current Earth Founder \u2018Taker by the Roots\u2019.</p><br/><p>A woman that possesses the same blood of the strongest hero.</p><br/><p>Based on the information of Sasae-chan, she was apparently unable to participate because she was pregnant, but it looks like she had already given birth. So that\u2019s why she ended up participating huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, it is just before a battle, and yet, it is so noisy it is annoying.\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people of the Earth Church are truly lacking grace and are noisy.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>From the deep part of the room, I heard the complaining voices of the previous fire hero Kyouka and the previous water hero Sarasa.</p><br/><p>I completely didn\u2019t notice them because of the shocking Mother Earth-level breasts, but these people were also here huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat weird people~. It be obvious that children are noisy. If ya complain on things like that all the time, ya can\u2019t become proper mothers, ya know~?\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you picking a fight?\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>The fire and water were seething in anger, but the earth was also releasing pressure that didn\u2019t lose to theirs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI simply said what\u2019s obvious, ya know~. In the first place, the fact that ya haven\u2019t gotten pregnant a single time even though ya already be older than twenty is something impossible to think of in mah countryside. Ya would need to be quite the ugly ones~.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth woman, whose only trait is to give birth like a rabbit, do you have enough strength as a hero to compensate for that big mouth of yours?!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. I am beginning to feel like it would be best to shut you up first before dealing with the conceited juniors!\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Kyouka and Sarasa take a battle stance. On the other hand, Yoneko-san looks like she is also fully intending to confront them.</p><br/><p>They are on really bad terms! As I thought, the previous heroes don\u2019t get along at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a hoarse voice was hurled out. The sharpness of that tone stopped the bloodthirst of the previous heroes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSobo-chan?!\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>The one who appeared was the Earth Founder Oba-san.</p><br/><p>This very person is someone who trampled in a past that is even farther away than the women here. Due to the presence of their great senior, not only her granddaughter Yoneko-san, even Sarasa and Kyouka stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoneko, the reason why I called ya here was not to have ya fight in a place like this. Understand yer own role.\u201d (Oba-san)</p><br/><p>\u201cI know~, Sobo-chan.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>Her words may sound obedient, but she is puckering her lips a hell lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYa two as well, ya must have yer own circumstances, but today, ya be members that will be fighting\u2019 together today-sa ne. Can\u2019t ya get together a bit?\u201d (Oba-chan)</p><br/><p>\u201cGet together, you say?! Don\u2019t joke around!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>Kyouka roars as she stands.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand, Earth Founder! My objective is to beat into shape my weakling of a junior. The team battle was something that was decided on their own convenience! I don\u2019t have a single shred of an intention to get along with this bunch!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no intentions of getting along with the enemy. Being a team battle is just in form; we will be doing our own thing.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, I don\u2019t know if this is a waiting room or whatever, but why do I have to be placed in the same room as these people?! Just breathing the same air as these people is displeasing!\u201d (Kyouka)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Light and Wind ones were not here from the very beginning, and yet, I feel like an idiot for faithfully staying here. I will be relaxing in a different room right now.\u201d (Sarasa)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Kyouka and Sarasa left the room angered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI be relieved that they are gone now~. If I be close to such widows, it would be bad for the education of this child.\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>No well, at the very least, Sarasa-san seems to be married though\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t even be described as not getting along.\u201d (Oba-san)</p><br/><p>The Earth Founder Oba-san says with a troubled tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that be the original shape of the five Churches-sa ne. For several centuries, we been fighting each other and stealing each other\u2019s profits. It be the same in my active days. Will this turn into a passing disorder, or will a new standard arise; the answer to that will be decided by this match.\u201d (Oba-san)</p><br/><p>Saying this, the Oba-san took the baby that Yoneko-san was carrying.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, ya go prepare as well. I be watching over this child. That\u2019s why I came here after all.\u201d (Oba-san)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief. Sobo-chan is so pushy and arbitrary~. But it be really okay to seriously aim to crush Sasae-chan?\u201d (Yoneko)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. If she gets crushed there, it just means she only amounted to that much-sa ne. Don\u2019t be going easy on them, Yoneko. This fight be showing the whole world the true worth of those girls after all.\u201d (Oba-chan)</p><br/><p>Is it like the beasts that push their children to the depths of a valley?</p><br/><p>As always, the things that the Earth Church do are scary.</p><br/><p>\u2026So, in the end, I practically didn\u2019t say anything since the moment I came to this room.</p><ul><li>185: Match Begins</li></ul><br/><p>At any rate, the bad relationship between the previous heroes was clear.</p><br/><p>They think of themselves as being way too strong, can\u2019t acknowledge each other, and can\u2019t even stay in the same room. That\u2019s why they can\u2019t forgive the relationship of the current heroes, and are trying to crush them.</p><br/><p>As a result, what came out was the match between the current heroes vs the previous heroes.</p><br/><p>With the match about to begin, the stadium was already filled with more than thousands of spectators.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that they would be fighting in front of such a big audience!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The Founders were sitting in the noble area in order to spectate, and I was also mixed in that group.</p><br/><p>I was plainly surprised by the amount of people.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t put things to an end in the eyes of the public, it won\u2019t serve as proof after all. The contra side also agreed to this-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Is what Yorishiro says as she smiles. Even though the Founders will be made to resign if they lose.</p><br/><p>Is this a display that she has confidence they certainly won\u2019t lose?</p><br/><p>But the reason of this big prosperity of people is not only because it is a clash between the old and new heroes. It is also because of the location of the stadium.</p><br/><p>This is the Wind capital, Rudras Metropolis.</p><br/><p>The Wind nation that had been clouded in mystery for many years has, for the first time, opened their gates to the public.</p><br/><p>The audience seats are filled with people from the Earth, Water, Fire, and Light nations that were burning with curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am grateful for the Wind Founder-sama\u2019s sponsorship in this-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Yorishiro looks at the Wind Founder Shiva that is sitting at her side and says this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wind Church has changed their policy of secrecy, so we will be having a lot of information exchanges, and you will be profiting plenty by selling the license fees of the ethereal technology knowledge that you have gathered up until now. Will today\u2019s fight be your first big step in publicity?\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cHope this won\u2019t be my last day as a Founder though.\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Shiva deftly evades the probing of Yorishiro.</p><br/><p>This economic treat is also an important factor that the contra reconciliation side want to get their hands on in this old and new heroes match.</p><br/><p>They are pulling strings here and there.</p><br/><p>It looks like the fight is about to begin.</p><br/><p>A young woman, that seems to be the announcer, makes an entrance at the center of the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you all gathered here today!! A battle that will be carving its mark in history is about to take place right here!! The heroes of the five Grand Churches; their current and previous heroes are divided in enemies and allies, and are going to be clashing!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The announcer explained the details of the sequence of events that led to this match. About the pro and contra reconciliation sides\u2019 confrontation, and the current and previous heroes representing them in this match.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the current heroes win, a new era will begin; if the previous heroes win, the era will be maintained the same! This is truly the turning point of history! Everyone, watch over this fight today, and become the witnesses of history!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience responds with a thunderous \u2018Oooo!!\u2019</p><br/><p>I feel as if it has been a festive mood this whole time. Is it my imagination?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, before the fight begins, let\u2019s have a special guest liven up the place!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A special guest?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, this demon intimidated the Fire capital, Muspelheim, but now, it is a mascot that\u2019s loved by everyone!! The Fire Cow Phalaris has come here to play with us in this Wind capital, Rudras Metropolis~!!\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, a familiar cow had run onto the stage and was running here and there doing its greetings.</p><br/><p>The audience reacted greatly to that.</p><br/><p>Many were cries of happiness, and there were places that went \u2018Kyaaa!! How cuteee!\u2019 and some that cheered.</p><br/><p>In response, the Fire Cow Phalaris lifted up its front legs high up and sends out one more greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the world is he doing?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The natural question that came out from me was answered by Yorishiro sitting beside me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked the Fire Church to bring him here. The Fire Cow Phalaris that the previous hero lost against it and the current hero who won against it; he is the most clearest representation of the superiority between the old and the new. By displaying it before the fight, it will stir up the enemy side even more-desu wa.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet there be hot-bloodedness.\u201d (Enou)</p><br/><p>No, even if that\u2019s the case\u2026! Why the hell is he fawning like crazy without any hesitation\u2026</p><br/><p>And as expected, even the incarnation of the Wind God Quasar, Shiva, noticed it too.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa\u2026that cow, could it be\u2026\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cMust be your imagination-desu wa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026those soul waves\u2026I feel like I have felt them before\u2026!\u201d (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it.\u201d \u201cThere are things that have no point in minding-desu wa.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. I won\u2019t mind it.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t mind that he is a mere shadow of the former Fire God Nova that tried to burn the surface world in the past!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The performance finished, and this time for sure, the match was about to begin.</p><br/><p>The announcer lady once again explains the format of the match.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe match will be a fight of five against five. It is a fight where the 10 old and new heroes will be jumbled up at the same time. Under certain conditions, it will be judged whether they are unable to continue the fight, and the one who wipes out the other side first will be the winner!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after the explanation, several entrance gates open around the stage.</p><br/><p>5 entrance gates in total are arranged at the outer edge of the stage, and if we were to connect the 5 entrances with lines, you would be able to draw a perfect pentagon.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn impartial raffle took place with the old and new heroes, and with that, it was decided from which entrance they would be coming out from!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>But there were five entrance gates opened in the stage. The current heroes have five and the previous heroes have five, so there\u2019s a total of ten.</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t the numbers lacking completely?</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom each entrance gate, there will be one old hero and one new hero. In other words, two heroes will be coming from one entrance gate at the same time! Once they have entered, the match will begin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Words of \u2018I see\u2019 were let out at the seats in the area after that explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a plan to hype up the match by adding a random factor to it-desu wa ne.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What do you mean by that?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth, water, fire, wind, and light; in this fight where these five elements will be jumbled together, the usage of the elemental affinities will become the key to victory.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Elements have their forte and weakness.</p><br/><p>Fire wins against wind, water wins against fire, earth wins against water, wind wins against earth, and light has slight advantage against all four elements.</p><br/><p>That rule has affected the battles we have had until now a lot of times.</p><br/><p>\u201cEspecially so in this fight. Avoiding the element that is disadvantageous for themselves, they have to attack the element they are advantageous against. The ones who manage to do that are the ones who will control the battle.\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThose entrance gates will be the highest denominator in this fight of elemental affinities. If it\u2019s just like the announcer explained, and the heroes that come out from the doors were decided completely randomly\u2026\u201d (Yorishiro)</p><br/><p>Two people will come out from one entrance. Moreover, the two will be of opposing sides.</p><br/><p>In that case, the ones who come out together will no doubt end up fighting with each other right from the beginning.</p><br/><p>Whether that opponent is an advantageous elemental affinity or a disadvantageous one will be decided by luck huh.</p><br/><p>Of course, this is a team match, so even if they come out together with an opponent whose element they are weak against, they can group up with their comrades, and if it\u2019s the contrary, they can pin down the opponent they are in an advantage against and defeat them.</p><br/><p>So we would be able to enjoy those kinds of strategic moves huh.</p><br/><p>I now understand the objective of this setup.</p><br/><p>I wonder which will be the sets that will be coming out from those entrances!!</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! What?!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>First entrance gate: current fire hero Mirack and the previous water hero Sarasa.</p><br/><p>Second entrance gate: current water hero Celestis and the previous earth hero Yoneko.</p><br/><p>Third entrance gate: current wind hero Hyue and the previous fire hero Kyouka.</p><br/><p>Fourth entrance gate: current earth hero Sasae-chan and\u2026what\u2019s with that unkempt hair woman?!</p><br/><p>No, what\u2019s more important is that, excluding the fifth entrance gate where Karen-san and Ates came out from, all the current heroes have gotten into a pairing that is overwhelmingly disadvantageous!!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, match begin!!\u201d</p></div></header><br/>\n</p></div>"}

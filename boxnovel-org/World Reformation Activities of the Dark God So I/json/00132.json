Completely safe to skip.&gt;</p><br/><p>First, we have the light hero, Kourin Karen-san.</p><br/><p>She is the first hero I met, and has been the one I have been acquainted for the longest since then. She is diligent and kind, and possesses the most balanced personality as a hero. Equipped in silver armor, her purity as if it were straight out of a painting is fitting to describe as a saint.</p><br/><p>Next, the second one is the fire hero, Katack Mirack.</p><br/><p>She is a friend of Karen-san since small, and there was a time when they were in bad terms, but after the relationship was fixed, they became even closer. Being caught by the creed of the fire, she has a manly character that seeks strength. Her body is also well-tempered, to the point that one might even mistake her for a man.</p><br/><p>The third one is the water hero, Re Celestis.</p><br/><p>She works as an idol while she fights monsters, a unique hero. Can also be considered a skilfull one. She is good at singing and dancing along with her fighting skills, and maybe because of this, her personality is also brilliant and cheerful. Her appearance is also excelling. She is a girl that sparkles intensely.</p><br/><p>The last one is the fourth, the earth hero, Gonbee Sasae.</p><br/><p>She is the newest addition to the group, and is the girl that came from the faraway Earth capital, Ishtar Blaze. She is the youngest within the heroes, and thus, her body is also small and thin. It looks like she herself thinks that she is a country bumpkin and has a complex about it, but that in itself makes her a simple and cute little girl.</p><hr/><br/><p>And so, those are all the four.</p><br/><p>Heroes that will have their names resound around the world.</p><br/><p>We have also accumulated a good amount of fights, and this team that has increased in numbers as the fights went on was\u2026truly a gathering that can be considered a team.</p><br/><p>These members are like a representation of the path we have taken and it is deeply moving.</p><br/><p>Today, there\u2019s something I wanted to talk to them about when we are all together.</p><br/><p>The thing I wanted to talk about is\u2026that\u2019s right\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding me loving Haine-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>By the time I noticed, the light hero Karen-san had come close to me.</p><br/><p>Or more like, she is hugging me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-san\u2026\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you not answering my feelings? I have said it over and over, right? I am not telling you to marry me immediately. I can tell from your behaviour that you are treasuring me. But at times, I would like to hear clear words that show it.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Wait wait wait wait, what\u2019s with this all of a sudden, Karen-san?</p><br/><p>Karen-san loving me is not something that happened recently, and I myself don\u2019t think badly of it, but\u2026why is she going on the offensive at this timing? Even though there\u2019s Mirack, Celestis, and Sasae around us?</p><br/><p>Karen-san, weren\u2019t you barely maintaining a line in front of people?</p><br/><p>And yet, why are you so suddenly going out of line?!</p><br/><p>As I was getting bewildered by this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren! It is always about this man. Why don\u2019t you say you love me as well?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>And now Mirack went crazy as well!</p><br/><p>The behaviour of Mirack towards her friend Karen gives a feeling of being further than that of friends, but she is suddenly coming out of the closet now?!</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how heated do you think my feelings are for you?! They are hotter than lava, hotter than the sun, you know! Are you going to treat those feelings of mine coldly?! Is it that?! Was being unkind towards you for several years the reason?! I apologize for that! Sorry! Sorry! That\u2019s why, please love me too!!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Wait, Mirack?!</p><br/><p>Your coming out of the closet is several times crazier than normal?!</p><br/><p>I did feel that Mirack\u2019s feelings towards Karen-san surpassed the barrier of gender, but isn\u2019t being this straightforward a bit too risky?!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dream~ is~\u266a\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>While we were at it, Celestis suddenly began singing.</p><br/><p>Is she also going to do something?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile being a hero~ I wish to become the best idol~ But the truth is~ I don\u2019t care about me at all~ With my singing~ my dancing~ I wish to grant energy~ to as many people as possible~ That way~ I will also achieve happiness~ In order to share the energy~ I need to have a mountain of energy~ In order to make everyone smile~ I myself have to smile first~\u266a\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>She surprisingly said something nice.</p><br/><p>But what\u2019s this? Isn\u2019t the flow of things been strange for a while now?</p><br/><p>The three of them have quirky sides to them, but today, that quirky side has lost its moderation.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt something has happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026because of this-dasu ka?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The new member of the hero party, earth hero Sasae-chan, seemed to be the only one who maintained her composure.</p><br/><p>In her hand, there\u2019s a single bottle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that bottle? A drink?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine-niichan took so long in coming, so I distributed them to everyone first. I be a big pain for everyone at the previous incident, so this be a soft drink I prepared as a sort of apology-dasu.\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Soft drink\u2026</p><br/><p>But I can feel a destructive power from it.</p><br/><p>I received that bottle from Sasae-chan to test it, and I try placing my nose close to the opening.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026It stinks of alcohol.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>No matter where you cut it, this is alcoholic. Thanks but no.</p><br/><p>The reason for this disastrous scene had become all clear now.</p><br/><p>\u201cSasae-chan, what are you making everyone drink? This is alcohol ya know. Of course it would release all the desires they have been holding inside their hearts. I wonder if it will be alright? This will definitely be etched as one of their most pained memories. It would be nice if they wake up without any memories of this thou\u2014?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are ya saying-dasu?! Karen-neechan and the others may look older in my eyes, but they be legit young ladies! I wouldn\u2019t recommend them alcohol before they be adults-dasu yo! This is! Just! Grape Juice-dasu!!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Grape Juice\u2026</p><br/><p>Why is it that it is making me feel a concrete anxiousness?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Grape Juice, can I ask the detailed manufacturing method?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cManufacturing method? It simply be made by wringing grapes-dasu yo?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>I see, I see.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this grape juice be high quality, so there be one more step to that. They ferment it-dasu.\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s WI-NE!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>So it really was wine, damn it!</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that the representative of fermented fruit juice wine?!</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t she notice with the simple fact that there\u2019s the word \u2018fermented\u2019?!</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? I wanted to show that mah feelings of reflecting were as high as a mountain and deeper than a valley-dasu yo. Isn\u2019t it more high class the more steps to production there is-dasu ka?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more doesn\u2019t make it better! Going too far can break the good!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I do something disgraceful again-dasu ka?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>No, it is actually Karen-san and the others that are currently in the middle of being disgraceful though.</p><br/><p>These three who probably ingested alcohol for the first time have become a cluster of drunkards hugging each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren! I love you! I love you dearly! No matter what happens in the future, I will protect you!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Mirack-chan! I love Mirack-chan too! We are the best of friends, aren\u2019t we?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, the number one best thing I have experienced in my life up until now was meeting you all! I thought friends were pointless things, but my friendship with you all is a treasure for me!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! If we join forces, we are invincible!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am really am glad to have met Mirack-chan and Celestis-chan!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI definitely won\u2019t forget this even till my death; the days I have lived with all of you!!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I pray that when the alcohol in their system is gone, they will have forgotten everything.</p><br/><p>What should I do about this muddy situation?</p><br/><p>My only saving right now is that Sasae-chan is still sober.</p><br/><p>She is the very cause of this, so it is hard to say that, but having at least one other person who still has their sanity helps me a lot in maintaining my own sanity.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Haine-niichan\u2026\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does Haine-niichan have six arms-dasu?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>No good, this girl is also a goner.</p><br/><p>Well, it would be strange for this girl to be the only one who hasn\u2019t drunk in this kind of atmosphere, but I thought that she had resistance to alcohol. Seriously, it looks like that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, but if ya have 6, that means it be fine to cut off 5, right? Yay~dasu. I wanted to try out cutting off the body of someone with the earth scythe at least once-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Moreover, only this girl has quite the darkness hidden inside her heart?!</p><br/><p>While I was doing a life-or-death race with Sasae-chan, I waited for everyone to wake up from their intoxication.</p><ul><li>133: Remake</li></ul><br/><p>\u201cOkay everyone, are you all sane now?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh? What?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cMy head smarts\u2026..\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were we doing?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere be a hole in mah memory-dasu?!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Good.</p><br/><p>Looks like the alcohol has conveniently purged that memory out of them.</p><br/><p>It is truly something good. If their memory had remained, all four of them might have taken a straight dive onto that window over there.</p><br/><p>Or maybe, the memory actually remains, but they are acting as if they don\u2019t remember, but if that\u2019s the case, more the reason I should just leave it be.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Haine-niichan\u2026\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, Sasae?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is the face of Haine-niichan filled with kiss marks-dasu?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201c<b>Silence.</b>\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Anyways!!</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a proper reason as to why I have all four heroes gathered here today.</p><br/><p>It is in order to talk about the things we have to do from now on.</p><br/><p>Subjugation of Mother Monsters.</p><br/><p>The most concrete form of disaster that covers this world, monsters, appear in the thousands because of a certain existence.</p><br/><p>That certain existence is the Mother Monsters. Monsters that give birth to monsters.</p><br/><p>In order to cut off that unproductive chain, there\u2019s no other way but to sever the origin of the monsters that are the Mother Monsters.</p><br/><p>After learning of this, I decided on wiping out the Mother Monster to eliminate all the monsters from this world.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a total of 4 Mother Monsters.</p><br/><p>The plan has already begun moving and the Earth Mother Monster, Grandma Wood, has been subjugated.</p><br/><p>But that is simply the first step. There\u2019s still the water, fire, and wind Mother Monsters somewhere in this world.</p><br/><p>My current objective is to find the remaining Mother Monsters, and eliminate them one by one properly.</p><br/><p>Because the course of events proceeded well, it could be said that the matter slid in a favorable manner.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s now a new state of affairs\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! We will defeat the Mother Monsters!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san roared valiantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the power of us, the hero alliance, and Haine-san!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026That\u2019s right. Allies have intruded in my plan and want to cooperate.</p><br/><p>Those allies are Karen-san and her jolly companions. They are all in the hero profession and have a close connection to the monsters being a danger to the world, so I understand their sentiments of wanting to join in, but\u2026I first decided on doing this task of defeating the Mother Monsters on my own.</p><br/><p>Monsters are a calamity that was created by Gods. I thought this was my responsibility as the Dark God Entropy.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also other reasons behind it though.</p><br/><p>But Karen-san and her group crossed over the line I drew, and in the end, saved me in my time of need. That\u2019s why, I can\u2019t have them stand in the sidelines anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt goes without saying why we have all gathered here today!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san took the role of advancing the meeting in my place.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is in order to have a discussion! The remaining three Mother Monsters, how will we defeat them! Thinking back on the giant tree that we fought at Ishtar Blaze, it is clear that the other remaining three won\u2019t be an easy fight. It is important for us to wring our brains here and make a careful plan to see how we will fight them!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m shivering in anticipation. I feel like it will be the ideal stage for the idol hero, Celes-tan!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Mirack and Celestis seem to be in too.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Now that I think about it, what about you, Sasae-chan?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes-dasu?\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>I try asking something that has been bothering me for a while now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it okay for Sasae-chan to be here?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The base of Sasae-chan, Ishtar Blaze, is faraway from the Light capital, Apollon City.</p><br/><p>Walking takes around a month; even with a flying machine powered by ethereal, it would take several days.</p><br/><p>If a monster disturbance occurs there\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI be glad that yer worried, but it be okay-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Sasae-chan puffs her small chest and answers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMah now Founder grandma-chan said this: \u2018Ye were a huge help in the incident with Great Pillar-sama, so this be our turn to help ya guys out now!\u2019. In Ishtar Blaze, there\u2019s the Onii-sans of the Scorched Earth Annihilation corps, and there\u2019s still a lot of Golems remaining-dasu! If we leave it to \u2018em, even if there be a strong monster appearing, they be okay even without a hero-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that sad in itself?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestis-chan, don\u2019t go further than that!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san scolded Celestis at her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, please let this earth hero Gonbee Sasae accompany you all in defeating the mother of the monsters-dasu! Please-dasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Sasae-chan placed both hands and knees on the floor towards me, and even her forehead.</p><br/><p>I could tell at a single glance; this girl is accustomed to doing dogeza.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It has been decided that Sasae-chan will be taken care of in Apollon City for a while.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>As if sending a lifeboat, Karen-san says this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Earth Founder Obaba-sama has also asked this of us. She said she wanted her grandchild, Sasae-chan, to accumulate experience as a hero.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right-dasu! I understood in the matter with Great Pillar-sama-dasu! I still don\u2019t have the ability and actual results as a hero! I wanna stay under the hero I respect, Karen-neechan-dasu yo!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the thing that you lack the most is your ability to analyze the situation and your decision making though. Just how many big tragedies have occurred because of your rampaging!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cMirack-chan, don\u2019t say further!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san scolded Mirack who was at her side.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Anyways, Yorishiro-sama has already accepted Sasae-chan to stay in the Light Church. That\u2019s why, all heroes will help Haine-san, and we are raging with the will to destroy all Mother Monsters! Haine-san, let\u2019s do our best together!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>In the end, it always comes to this huh.</p><br/><p>But I haven\u2019t forgotten that they saved me in the fight with Grandma Wood.</p><br/><p>This fight can decide the fate of the world. That\u2019s why, the heroes that are the representatives of humanity should join forces and fight together.</p><br/><p>I think that the important part of obstacles is not overcoming them, but to overcome them with the help of others.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood. Let\u2019s do our best together.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thought of doing this without me is a mistake in itself.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cDasu!\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>The heroes all without exception had their hearts race with determination.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026But there\u2019s a problem before that.\u201d</p><ul><li>134: Mother Monster investigation</li></ul><br/><p>The problem we have to deal with before subjugating the Mother Monsters.</p><br/><p>That is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know where the Mother Monsters are.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d \u201cYup\u2026\u201d \u201cGeez\u2026\u201d \u201cDasu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. The remaining three Monster Monsters, we have absolutely no idea where they are.</p><br/><p>It is impossible to kick the ass of someone that we don\u2019t where it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are back to this problem.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I remember being troubled by this before.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? We were filled with expectation thinking that you had all the information in your hands though. What a useless man.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not all-knowing, you know.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I return the unfounded expectations of Celestis without any strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, rising our expectations. How hopeless.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnreliable-dasu.\u201d (Sasae)</p><br/><p>These girls have been really relentless lately.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow now. But Haine-san, how did you learn of the Earth Mother Monster, Great Pillar-sama, then?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s uhm\u2026from a certain information source.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way I can tell them that I directly asked this from one of the four Base Element Gods that created the Mother Monsters. Moreover, that very person is the Fire God Nova that is currently lazing about as a cow-shaped monster.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, there\u2019s another piece of information I received from that source. The fire Mother Monster, only that one, I know its name and outward traits of.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh~, my element huh.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>The moment I mentioned fire, Mirack immediately bites.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Fire Mother Monster\u2019s name is the Immortal Phoenix. A giant bird-shaped monster, and the fire that covers its body is always burning itself, and from those ashes, many fire element monsters are given birth, or so I heard.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cA fire bird\u2026 Hm? \u2026\u2026Ah?!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>Mirack raises a voice that was screaming she noticed something.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that one?! \u2026\u2026Now that you mention it, that\u2019s true. But\u2014!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know of it, Mirack-chi?! In that case, don\u2019t just tease us and spill it already!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>Being pressed by Celestis, Mirack speaks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn Muspelheim, there are witness reports every now and then that say there has been a mysterious bird flying around the area. And its traits are just as you said just now, a bird that has its whole body covered in flames, moreover, it is probably quite big, the witnesses say that they noticed it even when it was flying from pretty far away.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah yeah, and?!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the abnormal outward appearance it has, the witnesses quickly concluded that it was a monster\u2026but the other party is a bird. By the time the report is given in Muspelheim, and the Fire Militant corps and the fire hero arrive at the place, it has long flown away.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, it seems there\u2019s witnesses of that fire bird, thereby there have been no records of fighting it.</p><br/><p>As expected, with wings that can let you freely fly in the sky, its whereabouts are unfettered.</p><br/><p>It is way too different from Grandma Wood that had its roots dug in and stayed in one place.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s more information regarding this fire bird. Moreover, from here on, it will enter into the gossip territory.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine, just say it already. We are in the step where we are still in between whether the Mother Monsters itself are gossip after all.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Regarding that fire bird, there\u2019s an occult-like story that has no positive proof about. It states that in the places where the fire bird is witnessed, a big monster disaster will definitely occur soon after.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no proof that they are connected though. Thanks to that, that bird is being called \u2018The Bird that informs of Calamities\u2019 and \u2018the Herald of Catastrophe\u2019. But if it is just as Haine says about that being a monster that gives birth to monsters\u2026\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt falls way too in place!\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>If a disaster will certainly occur in the places that the Phoenix passes through, that\u2019s because the Phoenix itself gave birth to those fire element monsters.</p><br/><p>The fire bird is not a Herald of Catastrophe, it is the Bringer of Catastrophe.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Damn it!! That bird! If I had known that, I would have placed subjugating it as my highest priority!\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it is exactly because it is a bird that it doesn\u2019t stay in one place. That\u2019s why you weren\u2019t even able to fight it all this time, right? Even if you notice the importance it held\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be practically impossible to defeat it. Even if there\u2019s a witness report and we use the flying machines to rush to that place the moment we receive it, it is questionable whether it will still be there. Moreover, the witness reports itself are once every several years.\u201d (Mirack)</p><br/><p>So it really is impossible to catch the Immortal Phoenix huh.</p><br/><p>And while Mirack was speaking, there\u2019s Celestis at her side that was slowly getting a more and more serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, about the water Mother Monster, you have no info about it, right?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah\u2026 Not only the place, even its shape and traits\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>It is still a complete mystery.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been wondering\u2026I think that the water Mother Monster is at the sea.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water element monsters are all aquatic creatures, and the places where they appear are in a waterside or underwater. On top of that, most of the biggest ones are found in the biggest water source, at the sea. Let\u2019s assume that the water Mother Monster is inside the sea, the monsters it spreads are from the sea, moreover, if they run through the rivers to go through the whole world\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>It would make sense huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, there\u2019s no doubt that there have been witnesses to the fire bird and the giant tree, but from what I remember, I have no memory of hearing about witnesses of a water element monster of about the same gigantic size. The only one would be the Great Sea Dragon we fought before, but that wasn\u2019t a Mother Monster, right?\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it is not. Just that, I can say with confidence.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, as I thought, it is safe to say that there\u2019s no witnesses to a water Mother Monster. The reason why there\u2019s for fire and earth and not for water\u2026the most plausible reason would be\u2026\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it is hidden inside the sea huh.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The sea is wide enough for that. Even if the water Mother Monster possesses the same size as that giant tree, the sea can easily receive it whole. And it is also possible to hide from the eyes of humans for centuries.\u201d (Celestis)</p><br/><p>I have lost. Celestis\u2019 conjecture is quite convincing.</p><br/><p>Coacervate once said: \u2018The sea is greatness. It is able to store many things inside of it\u2019. The very person that created the Mother Monster, if it is that underhanded God, there\u2019s certainly a possibility that he is utilizing that greatness to its best.</p><br/><p>But the conclusion that comes from that conjecture is that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFinding the water Mother Monster will be harder than the fire bird.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>We would have to dive deep into the sea which is a lot wider than the land, so just imagining it is making my head hurt.</p><br/><p>Even if I were to devote several lives as Kuromiya Haine, I don\u2019t have the confidence that I would be able to find it.</p><br/><p>Finding the Immortal Phoenix will be difficult.</p><br/><p>It would be impossible to find the water Mother Monster that we don\u2019t even know its name.</p><br/><p>I did have an inkling that it was the case but, we are completely closed in all directions.</p><br/><p>We only defeated Grandma Wood who didn\u2019t bring much harm to humans. Is this how our plan will come to an end?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we have no choice but to bet on the last remaining one.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san suddenly said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wind Mother Monster.\u201d (Karen)</p></div></header><br/>\n</p></div>"}

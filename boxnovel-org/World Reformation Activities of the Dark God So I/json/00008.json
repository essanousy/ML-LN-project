You guys are the leftovers!! Trash that didn\u2019t make the cut!! That\u2019s why you were brought here! Understood?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am!!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, I will be making you useless trash into the strongest and all-purpose trash!! By the time I say it is already okay, you guys should have become trash that won\u2019t lose to anyone! Can you keep up?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, question! Where\u2019s this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201dThe kitchen of the light church! Ma\u2019am!!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! And I am the one in charge of the light church\u2019s kitchen, the head chef, Angan Regine!! For you guys who have been sent here to do subordinate work, I am the captain, I am the God!! Understood?!\u201d (Regine)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201dYes ma\u2019am!!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the place that governs all the meals of the light church! The priests, knights, the founder-sama! The food we make heads to those people in their holy line of work!! If you see it lightly as some miscellaneous work, we will drown you in the sea of Bejimait! Breakfast is a battle! Lunch is a battle too! And dinner is a war!! There are times when we have to prepare emergency food for the Knight Corps when they depart after all!! If you guys exert yourself here, you will become splendid cooks of Light!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201dYes! Ma\u2019\u2026am!!!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY\u2014Yes\u2026ma\u2019am!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, Kuromiya Haine here.</p><br/><p>Given the element board to hold, the needle, that was supposed to point one of the five elements, broke because of the Dark God soul I had inside this body, and I was splendidly rejected.</p><br/><p>And so, the place I was send to is the kitchen of the light church\u2019s main headquarters, and it seems I will now be made to work as an apprentice to become a Light cook.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only me. The people that didn\u2019t have the needle of the element board pointing at the light element were forcefully send to the church\u2019s numerous miscellaneous duties.</p><br/><p>We were being placed to work right away like work-horses.</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This is not how it was supposed to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Is what the guy at my side said.</p><br/><p>By the way, he was ordered together with me to peel potatoes and we were currently moving our knifes at the back of the kitchen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my plans, the me that was supposed to have passed the exam with flying colors would enter the Aurora Knight Corps, immediately stand out, show achievements one after the other, get popular with the girls, and have a flowery lifestyle. And yet, what\u2019s this about peeling potatoes? This doesn\u2019t turn into a career at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that in the presence of Regine-san. You are gonna get a shoulder throw from that.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>His name is Frost.</p><br/><p>He is a newcomer like me that accepted the recruitment of the light church, but the needle pointed at an element other than light and was rejected from entering the knight corps.</p><br/><p>And so, he was send to the kitchen as a miscellaneous worker, but it seems he is sent to do a majority of things I am also send to do, and now, we have completely become friends with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so pessimistic about it. Even this potato peeling, if you get serious about it, it can be unexpectedly fun, you know? Just how well can you peel it as perfectly as possible\u2026\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I want to peel is not the skin of a potato, but the clothes of girls!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you continue saying things like that, I think that even if you become a knight, you won\u2019t be popular.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>If we exclude the part about his perverted way of speaking, he is a good guy, and we were soon able to become good friends.</p><br/><p>\u2018So the humans have evolved in a variety of manners\u2019, is what I have realized.</p><br/><p>In that sense, the wild actions of that Regine-san person were also likeable.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s write what happened today in a letter and send it to mother and father.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, Haine, why are you here?\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that sudden and weird question? Was that a philosophical question?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is not the type of question asking where we have come from and where we are headed to. What I mean is\u2026you are pretty famous within the newcomers. In the time when they were recruiting newcomers, there\u2019s talk that you got into a fight with the captain and send him flying. Even I have heard about it.\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t send him flying. I was stopped right before I sent him flying after all.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cGeh, then the part about you fighting him was true?! Moreover, from how you said it, you were 90% in the winning side?! \u2026Well, there\u2019s the matter about the entrance exam. Even if the element is different, you could have gotten send to a better place than this. Or more like, isn\u2019t it fine to have you enter the knight corps?\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s what he meant by that \u2018why are you here?\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am plenty satisfied here though. Cooking is fun.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a man lacking in ambition! If you are a man, even if you are to fall in a place like this, at least have a goal like having a date with sis Regine!!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Frost, you are aiming for her? For that Regine-san?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How\u2026old is sis Regine?\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on the information I have, 32 years old.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c32 huh. Barely in my strike zone.\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>Is he seriously going to aim for it?</p><br/><p>I was beginning to feel fear towards my new friend, but well, it has nothing to do with me, so I concentrate in peeling potatoes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh~, there\u2019s a guy with interesting taste here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUo.\u201d \u201cHiaaaa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>A shiny bald head suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>It is the vice captain that was in charge of the entrance exam, Grades.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a warning, pair of newcomers. You better give up on that amazon. There was a formal light knight who stroke the ass of Regine as a joke while she was working as a waitress, but\u2026\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What happened?!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe got an axe kick on his head and is groaning on his hospital bed even to this current day.\u201d (Grandes)</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea to have that woman enter the light knights?</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s leave that aside for now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you have some sort of business here, vice captain? To suddenly appear at the back of the kitchen like this, could it be that the knight corps have nothing to do?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cold way of putting it. Well, it is that, there\u2019s also other girls in the light church that you shouldn\u2019t anger. Last time, I messed up with that person, so I have come to make a recovery.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaine, I have brought something nice for you\u2026\u2026 There\u2019s no one here aside from you guys, right?\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is the back of the kitchen. If it is inside the kitchen, there\u2019s a lot of people though. Should I call them?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it! I only have business with you!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>The bald vice captain looks warily around before putting his hand inside a hemp sack.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, what is it? Is it something erotic?\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>Frost judges the wariness of the vice captain in this way, and gets excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up. It can\u2019t be helped, so I will show it to you too. Don\u2019t tell anyone about me walking around with this, okay?\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>What came out from the hemp sack was a rectangular box-looking thing that was slightly big to carry around.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What\u2019s this? It doesn\u2019t look like something erotic at all.\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just your own assumption. You see, this is an element measuring device.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Element measuring device?</p><ul><li><strong>09: A glimpse of culture</strong></li></ul><br/><p>According to the explanation of vice captain Grades, it seems this element measuring device is used to estimate the element amount of a person. &lt;Duh&gt;</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t that the same as the element board used at the entrance exam?\u2019, is the retort I gave out, and the vice captain makes a supplementary explanation as if biting the words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something superior to the element board. With ethereal energy, it measures elements with a lot more detail and accuracy.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cEthereal energy?! Isn\u2019t that a machine then?!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>When Frost lifted his voice, vice-captain Grades glares at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I said not to tell anyone! Okay? Don\u2019t tell anyone! Especially people like the captain!!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Frost was startled by the anger of the vice-captain and slowly withers down.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s parts that I can\u2019t get the outline of from the conversation between the two, but for now, let\u2019s leave that aside and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, we can have a better measurement of our element compared to the element board?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Showing is worth more than a thousand words. Hey, you are the one that came from the Reustor village, Frost, right?\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Yes!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>It is unexpected to see someone high-up like a vice-captain knowing the name of Frost.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was the one in charge of the entrance exam. I have properly gone through the list of newcomers. I will be using the element measuring device on you, Frost.\u201d(Grades)</p><br/><p>At the surface of the element measuring device there were five frames, and at the same time this was directed at Frost, shining words appear inside the frames. Rather than calling it words, they were actually numbers.</p><br/><p>[Earth: 105] [Water: 130] [Light: 128] [Fire: 214] [Wind: 309]</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrost is more specialized in wind than fire huh. 309 is quite the high number, you know. If you had gone to the Wind Church of Ludora, you would have been placed in the Whirlwind Raid Corps, no doubt.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously?! I will go now!!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. You have already joined the Light Church, so we won\u2019t be letting you escape.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeeeh?!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>If it were the element board, it would only point the strongest element, but the element measuring device will show you in numbers how much of an affinity you have with each element huh.</p><br/><p>It is true that the amount of information obtained is completely different.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uhm, vice-captain Grades, is it okay to ask a question?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cFrost\u2019s strongest element is the wind element, but I think the second one, the fire element, also has quite the high number.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. With a 214, if it were light element, it is a numbers that\u2019s plenty enough to enter the knight corps.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo waaay!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>Ignoring Frost who was beaten up by reality, I continue the talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean the people that didn\u2019t have the light element pointed in the entrance exam, could have had their second strongest element as light, moreover, there\u2019s the possibility they had a good enough number to get a pass?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Vice-captain Grades answered this question with a heavy tone that he hasn\u2019t used until now.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s exactly as you say. The element board is, in the end, something that simply points the highest elemental affinity one has. To put it in another way, even if the light element is only a 100, if the other numbers are all lower than 99, you would get a pass. On the contrary, even if you have a light element number of 300, if there\u2019s at least one other element that has a number of 301, you will end up rejected.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that? Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just as Frost says. But that\u2019s the current state of the Light Church\u2026no, the current state of the whole world.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>The current state of the whole world.</p><br/><p>I felt an unpleasant ring from those words, but I had no choice but to leave it aside for now as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly! The main issue is you, Kuromiya Haine! I will be using this element measuring device on you!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see! The element board had its needle broken, but if it\u2019s this device, there might be a result appearing, right?!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cExaaaactly! Am I not a genious?!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a genius! Oh~ brave, hero! Please let me enter the knight corps!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! Caaaan\u2019t!!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this, these two guys are hitting it off pretty smoothly. Is there sympathy or something there?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2013!!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cGotta test it out! Now then, using this element measuring device\u2026\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>And so, the numbers that were shown\u2026</p><br/><p>[Earth: 000] [Water: 000] [Light: 000] [Fire: 000] [Wind: 000]</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, retreeeeat! Retreaaat!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was stupid for expecting anything! Thinking Haine-kun was a capable child was only an illusion of mine!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Even if you tell me that\u2026</p><br/><p>I will be repeating myself here but, I am the reincarnation of the Dark God. My element is absolutely \u2018darkness\u2019.</p><br/><p>This element measuring device most likely doesn\u2019t have enough functions to perfectly measure a person\u2019s element.</p><br/><p>If this measuring device had a sixth entry, it would probably have the numbers 999 there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? But having element numbers all 0 should be impossible. No matter how low it is, you would normally have 100, you know?\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously?! Haine, are you okay? Did you eat something bad?!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way food would be a deciding factor for elements.</p><br/><p>Humans are beings that were created with the divine powers of six Gods. That\u2019s why six elements exist.</p><br/><p>In truth, it would be ideal to have a good balance of 6 elements mixed in, and leaning too much onto one would be bad.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Could it be\u2026the element measuring device broke because of Haine just like the time with the element board? Isn\u2019t this bad? Hey, this was a rented one, you know?!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, vice-captain Grades, the lowest number is around 100, but what would be the highest in terms of element number?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I kind of got interested in it and tried asking.</p><ul><li><strong>10: The hero heads out</strong></li></ul><br/><p>\u201cHm? The upper limit for the element number huh. Generally speaking, around 400.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! Then my 309 in the wind element is high isn\u2019t it?! Damn it!!! If only I had gone to the Wind Church!!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you see, there\u2019s always exceptions. For example, the light hero, Karen-sama.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>Karen.</p><br/><p>The girl that was the very person who invited me to the Light Church.</p><br/><p>I have not seen her since the time we separated at the entrance exam but, I wonder what she is doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen and be amazed. The element number of Karen-sama is apparently around 700.\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Seven hundred?!\u201d</p><br/><p>A 400 is supposed to be the upper limit, and yet, she has 700?!</p><br/><p>Impossible. If a person had that much inclination in an element, this would be in a level that would affect their very life. It would be another case if there\u2019s the soul of a God inside just like me though.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven within the church, they can measure a detailed number for their elements, after doing a complicated ritual that takes around 1 week, that is. Karen-sama was chosen to be the light hero based on that strong element number. And so, our job as the knight corps is to support the hero-sama!!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>I see. In other words, heroes are the strongest ones in the knight corps.</p><br/><p>With an elemental affinity of 700 in the light element, power follows.</p><br/><p>A group that fights with the hero as the centre. That\u2019s the knight corps.</p><br/><p>But being a combat organization means that there\u2019s obviously something you are fighting against, right?</p><br/><p>While I was thinking: \u2018What are they fighting against?\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you were in a place like this!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Eeeeh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time I noticed, there was a beautiful girl in white armour standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-sama?!\u201d \u201cHero Karen-sama?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grades and Frost were extremely flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cVice captain Grades was also here? I said this before, didn\u2019t I? Haine-san can add to our fighting force immediately, so let him enter no matter the element. And yet, why is he doing mere miscellaneous work in the kitchen?!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, well\u2026this is work as well, you know. It is not like I can do anything I want, you know!!\u201d (Grades)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t call it \u2018mere miscellaneous work in the kitchen\u2019! If Regine-san heard that, we would be seeing blood!\u201d (Frost)</p><br/><p>The two got incredibly scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaren-san? Why are you in a place like this?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is obviously to look for you! This is an emergency! This may be sudden but, there\u2019s the need of Haine-san\u2019s assistance!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san takes my hand and forcefully pulls it.</p><br/><p>\u201cVice captain Grades as well, return to your station as soon as possible and command the knights! Haine-san and I will be heading out first! Please tell that to the captain while you are at it!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>While I was confused on what was going on, I got pulled by Karen-san and change the location.</p><br/><p>At the place we arrive at, there was something there I didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uhm, what\u2019s this?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cA small flying motorcycle machine powered by ethereal energy.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it is a flaptor type, only one person can ride it, but in exchange, it has speed. Also, this little one is especially modified for my use, so it is the number one model for speed. 37 times faster. Well, that\u2019s only the written specs though.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201c???????\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t understand what she was saying at all.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s in front of me is probably the same type as those ethereal cars that are running all around the city and the element measuring device that the vice captain Grades had.</p><br/><p>How to say it, it is as if it was made with a cradle as its design, looks like it would be incredibly fast. And from both sides, there were wings coming out from it, and it looked like it was possible to fly. And it seems it is big enough to have people ride on it. &lt;Definitely a Laputa reference&gt;</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not made to have two people ride it, but since circumstances are circumstances; Haine-san, please hold tightly to my back.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>While saying this, Karen-san straddles onto the so called small flying machine, as if riding a horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow! Haine-san too!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following the same movements as Karen-san, I straddle onto the back of the flying machine, and wrap my arms around her body.</p><br/><p>She told me to do it. And she had an atmosphere saying she won\u2019t be taking a no for an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlace more strength into it! You will get thrown off like this, you know!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Like this?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t tell you to grab my boobs.\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I kind of know what\u2019s going to happen now.</p><br/><p>\u201cTakeoff! We are going at full speed!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>\u201cOooooohhh?!!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The flying machine we were riding really flew.</p><br/><p>Moreover, at an incredible speed. The air was hitting me with terrifying density, and it is certainly true that I was about to be thrown off by it.</p><br/><p>\u201cK-Karen-san!

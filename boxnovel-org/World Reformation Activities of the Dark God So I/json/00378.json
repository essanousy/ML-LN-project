Assistant!!\u201d</p><br/><p>We were thinking about passing the day hanging out with the Demon Lords, but a Light Knight came flying to report to us.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmergency call!\u201d</p><br/><p>Emergency call?</p><br/><p>In this era, we can exchange information with other nations in an instant thanks to the ethereal wireless technology.</p><br/><p>Even if one of our places gets attacked, we can immediately fly to their aid, and we will be able to provide fast assistance with the use of the flying machines.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmergency call from Rudras Metropolis!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRudras Metropolis\u2026 That\u2019s pretty close.\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>The moving city of Rudras Metropolis is currently at standby in a place close by to Apollon City in case of any unexpected events.</p><br/><p>Karen-san and I ran to the communication room and faced the mic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Kuromiya Haine speaking! Wind Church member, can you hear me?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>{Haine\u2026 Is that Haine?!}</p><br/><p>This voice.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it Shiva?!</p><br/><p>For the Founder himself to make a call, moreover, from how he is speaking, I can tell he is in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?! What happened?! Explain the situation!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>{That monster\u2026! We weren\u2019t even in its sight\u2026..! It treated us as pebbles at the roadside\u2026! A whole city\u2026!}</p><br/><p>The speaker was relaying the voice of Shiva that was faraway, and it was reproducing the pained voice of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi! Oi! Is Rudras Metropolis okay?! What about the damage?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>{Don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s not much damage on our side\u2026.. It didn\u2019t give us any attention, so the damage was kept at a minimum\u2026.. How laughable.} (Shiva)</p><br/><p>His voice was filled with regret and self-derision.</p><br/><p>{It was so sudden that we didn\u2019t have the time to bring out the hero or the Kazama Shinobis. That guy only shot one divine power attack. However, that one attack blew away Rudras Metropolis and made it bounce three times.} (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Bounce?!</p><br/><p>The whole Rudras Metropolis?!</p><br/><p>It may be the smallest out of the five Great Cities, but the city is basically a moving fortress, and yet, with one attack?!</p><br/><p>{The reason we didn\u2019t flip upside down was thanks to the balancer that Juo invented. But because of that, Rudras Metropolis\u2019 moving engine has completely stopped. Many buildings inside have been destroyed. We can\u2019t head out to provide assistance. We have our hands full in the rescuing inside the city.} (Shiva)</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? We are the ones who should be going to help. We will send Aurora Knight corps with relief goods, so\u2014!!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>{DON\u2019T!!} (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The agitated shout of Shiva made me gulp my breath.</p><br/><p>To think Shiva would lose his wits to this extent.</p><br/><p>{There\u2019s no need to send help to us! You guys should strengthen the defenses of the city! That\u2019s why we called you!!} (Shiva)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>{That thing\u2019s objective is you guys! The place where you guys are, Apollon City!! Our Rudras Metropolis was only coincidentally in the way, so it pushed us to the side!!} (Shiva)</p><br/><p>Just what in the world\u2026!</p><br/><p>{I will be the one sending reinforcements! When the situation has stabilized, I will immediately send Hyue as well! That\u2019s why, resist until then, please!! Listen well, survive!!} (Shiva)</p><br/><p>*****</p><br/><p>With the call of Shiva that left no opening to speak back ending, I immediately left from the Light Grand Church. And then, I look at the direction where Rudras Metropolis is.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is happening, Haine-san?\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>Karen-san seemed to be uneasy as well.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know either. I don\u2019t know, but I can clearly tell it is something incredibly bad.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026? A mountain range\u2026?\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Was there a mountain range at that direction.</p><br/><p>No, there\u2019s no way.</p><br/><p>The moving city of Rudras Metropolis cannot traverse properly through mountainous terrain, so it would always choose flat ground.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, there\u2019s no way there would be a mountain range at the direction of Rudras Metropolis!</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another mystery occurs.</p><br/><p>That mountain range began to swerve.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mountain is\u2026moving?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, Haine-san! That\u2019s not a mountain!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>The other members of the Light Church began to come out after hearing the uproar and were equally flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not a mountain, but a snake! An incredibly big snake is slithering!!\u201d (Karen)</p><br/><p>It is exactly as Karen-san says.</p><br/><p>A giant snake that can be mistaken for a mountain was slithering towards us!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026what blew away Rudras Metropolis?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Where is the head and tail end of that snake?</p><br/><p>The body of the snake is so big that it was impossible to find it.</p><br/><p>\u2014No, I found it.</p><br/><p>The giant upper body of the beast that was slithering its way towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe head of the snake\u2026is actually a human body?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Upper body is human, lower half is snake; moreover, its whole body is as big as a mountain.</p><br/><p>Could it be, this is\u2026the strongest and last Demon Lord?</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord that reigns over light, the Great Demon Lord Lucifer?!</p><ul><li>379: Leader Inauguration</li></ul><br/><p>This is\u2026the Great Demon Lord Lucifer?</p><br/><p>A giant beast that one could mistake for a mountain, and instead of a snake head, it has a human upper half.</p><br/><p>Truly strange-looking.</p><br/><p>To the point that would make me have goosebumps.</p><br/><p>Its rough reptilian skin brought about a feeling of disgust in a physiological level.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know the reason, but it is probably an instinctive ability that snakes scatter through species that are several times smaller than it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, a part of it looks exactly like a human.</p><br/><p>That upper half of a robust man combined what a human is used to seeing with that of a beast, making the picture even more grotesque.</p><br/><p>\u201cAkakakakakakakakaka!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The roar that pierced the air and cut apart the eardrums further increased the disgustingness.</p><br/><p>It is a mass of repulsiveness.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the last threat of the Demon Lord battle.</p><br/><p>Lucifer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the world is going on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>People came out one after the other from the Light Grand Church where one can see the abnormality that is the new Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>And within that group, there\u2019s Michael, Gabriel, and Uriel.</p><br/><p>They were holding a philosophy book, idol poster, and an alcohol bottle respectively. I could tell that they were fully enjoying the human culture in Apollon City.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiih?! What\u2019s with that disgusting thing?!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Even Gabriel had gotten scared by Lucifer\u2019s atypical appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that\u2019s\u2026!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Demon Lord, Lucifer\u2026sama?\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Uriel and Michael were dumbstruck by what seems to be the first time they see their ruler Great Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I see him in action! Is that really Lucifer-sama?! I only saw his cocoon so\u2026\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t see him directly when he was sleeping in the castle, but to think he would be this big! Isn\u2019t he a lot bigger than the castle that served as his cocoon?!\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it! That castle itself was Lucifer-sama! So we were using the inside of Lucifer-sama as our base?!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Voices of agitation were leaking out from the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>And within them, there was one who had his fists tightly gripped and trembling.</p><br/><p>No, his whole body was trembling. The one who was trembling as if trying to hold back his raging stream of emotions was Michael.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What \u2018Great Demon Lord\u2019\u2026!!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Wa?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat thing is not a Demon Lord. It is just a giant monster. It is true that it is gigantic, but I can\u2019t feel intelligence or a soul! It is just a giant monster that brings about destruction by the orders of its God!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cN-Now that you mention it\u2026!\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>Monsters repeated a cycle of life and death for a century long, and at the end of that accumulated experience, is what brought about the Demon Lords who have a will and soul.</p><br/><p>They are truly worthy of being the rulers of monsters. In order to get the best out of the intelligence they have gotten, a trait of them is that they possess a physique similar to that of humans.</p><br/><p>But the Great Demon Lord that\u2019s supposed to stand at the summit of Demon Lords doesn\u2019t fit any of those traits.</p><br/><p>A size that far surpasses that of humans, an abnormal lower half that can take up the whole vision of someone, and that way of acting, that roar didn\u2019t have a single shred of intelligence from it. It is basically a beast.</p><br/><p>It is just like the Hydra Serpent we fought before; a puppet with no will controlled by a God.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were worshipping that thing as our summit?! We called that the Lord of Monsters?! Don\u2019t joke around!!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>The roar of Michael echoed powerfully within the whole structure of this Light Grand Church.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis made it clear! As I thought, that woman\u2026Sunnysol Ates, she was deceiving us Demon Lords!! Lucifer already isn\u2019t worth respect!!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>And then, as if showing the anger in his heart, the Fire Demon Lord spreads out his fire wings.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, I -Michael- will take command of us Demon Lords. Gabriel, Uriel! Entrust your lives to me!!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>Michael shouts loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI maintained equality because we were under Lucifer, and because I neglected giving order to the Demon Lords, we lost Raphael! I won\u2019t let the same mistake happen! From today on, I -Michael- will lead you guys as the leader of the Demon Lords!!\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief, finally the leader is going to act as the leader huh.\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really mind. There\u2019s no other than Michael who would take a troublesome role like that anyways.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>Uriel and Gabriel accepted the resolve of their comrade lightheartedly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Kuromiya Haine.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>I was surprised by the sudden mention of my name.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the job of dealing with that Lucifer to us Demon Lords.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe trouble that us monsters have created, will be put to an end by us monsters. That is the true order of this world.\u201d (Michael)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201dWe gotta pay you guys back for putting up with us after all.\u201d (Uriel)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys help out that Wind capital that seems to have received damage. I want to learn the culture of that nation one of these days.\u201d (Gabriel)</p><br/><p>And then, the three Demon Lords spread out their symbolic divine power wings and fly into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?! Wait! Do you mean that\u2026!\u201d (Haine)</p><br/><p>Karen-san and I had no choice but to absentmindedly see off the Demon Lords that were leaving.</p><br/><p>Could it be that what is about to begin now is\u2026a direct battle between the three Demon Lords led by Michael against Lucifer?!</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-376-377-whereabouts-of-goddess\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 376-377 - Whereabouts of Goddess\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/world-reformation-activities-of-the-dark-god-%E2%80%94-loving-humans-so-much-i-reincarnated-in-one-chapter-380-381-demon-lords-frontline\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 380-381 - Demon Lords frontline\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"236398\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

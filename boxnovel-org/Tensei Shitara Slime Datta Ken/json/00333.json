That\u2019s hardly anything. Is it a small village? In that case, I don\u2019t know if we can expect any good food or amazing art that would draw our interest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I guess this world is a miss after all. I mean, they seem too busy with their war to build an interesting culture.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 You are probably right. But, well\u2026we should still check it out anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. We came all this way, after all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That is what Veldora and Ramiris started to say upon hearing Sharma\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>Rindo could not hide his confusion.</p><br/><p>It was not what he had expected at all.</p><br/><p>Their purpose was the search for new entertainment. They had no interest in their military power at all\u2014but as Rindo knew none of this, he was left to be confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right-right. We still haven\u2019t finished thanking you yet. We cannot offer you much, but we prepared a little meal for you. I\u2019ll bring it right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza seemed to have sensed the awkward atmosphere, and he said this as if to help lighten things up.</p><br/><p>This was one of their bases, and it had the facilities for several people to live here for a few weeks.</p><br/><p>Food was very valuable at this time, but as long as there was a need to monitor the Empire, it was necessary to keep this place stocked.</p><br/><p>And yet Zaza meant to serve this valuable food to Veldora and the others.</p><br/><p>It was his way of showing his appreciation.</p><br/><p>Zaza prepared the food himself and set it out in front of them.</p><br/><p>However\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not require food. Ramiris, you can eat it if you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, really? Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. So you do spoil her after all, Beretta? Oh, well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not need food\u2013but that meant he could eat it\u2013and yet Beretta pushed his food towards Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Veldora watched this with jealous eyes, but the real problem occurred after that.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat then! Huh, what is this? It feels like playdough and has no taste! And this water is muddy!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Disgusting. What is this tablet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Hey! What is the meaning of this!? Are you trying to bully me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly! Someone as great as I will not allow this insult to go unpunished!!\u201d</p><br/><p>To Veldora and Ramiris, the food was of unbelievably low quality.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t poison.</p><br/><p>It was actually very well balanced in terms of energy.</p><br/><p>However, it did not seem like the kind of thing to give to guests as a show of gratitude.</p><br/><p>Hate based off of food was strong. And Veldora and Ramiris were very gluttonous.</p><br/><p>They had been served something inedible, and now the fires of rage burned hot within them.</p><br/><p>Zaza became frantic.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey. Please wait! This is our precious \u2018water,\u2019 \u2018energy tablet\u2019 and \u2018solid food\u2019! Taste? Who would ask for something so luxurious!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza was truly shocked as he fired back at Veldora and Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Their resources were so scarce now, and a single meal was very valuable.</p><br/><p>One of the reasons that they attacked the Empire was so that they could take food supplies from the enemy\u2019s food production plants.</p><br/><p>In this situation, taste was hardly important.</p><br/><p>They were lucky to be able to eat enough to survive.</p><br/><p>As a cyborg, Zaza only needed a cup of water and one energy tablet to run for an entire day.</p><br/><p>However, this was not the case for most of the residents. A full meal consisted of water, energy tablet and solid food. It was the bare minimum for them to survive.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Automata, who had enhanced cells through cultivation.</p><br/><p>Unless the majority of your body was a machine, like Zaza, you had to consume valuable food resources.</p><br/><p>Zaza was so serious that even Veldora and Ramiris saw that it was not a joke or an attempt to offend them.</p><br/><p>\u201cRamiris. Perhaps this food really is incredibly valuable to these people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a surprise, master\u2026 He wouldn\u2019t be lying, would he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris and Veldora looked at each other with amazement.</p><br/><p>Just then, Sharma opened her mouth with a gentle expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm yourself, Zaza. It seems that the food was not to our guests\u2019 liking. But this is the best that we can do. And\u2026if you don\u2019t mind, may I ask you one thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>She sounded gentle, but firm.</p><br/><p>And she was now looking straight at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Ask whatever you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora said. And so Sharma did.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let me ask you this. You put the tablet in your mouth just now. Does that mean you do not know how to eat it? I am sure you find me rude, but can you answer me that?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said.</p><br/><p>Zaza and Rindo were more surprised than Veldora and Ramiris by this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cSharma, what did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. I am a cyborg with no taste buds, but normally\u2026 Now that I think of it, you took the solid food and\u2026 What? Could it really be\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora and the others had no idea what Sharma meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow to eat it? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What\u2019s wrong with just putting it in your mouth?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were very confused.</p><br/><p>After that, Sharma demonstrated it for them.</p><br/><p>While it was fine to just swallow the tablet, it was considered normal to mix it in with the solid food.</p><br/><p>The tablet dissolves into the dough and adds some flavour to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese tablets are incredibly expensive tablets that allow you to enjoy five different flavors. The taste changes with every bite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharma explained as she demonstrated.</p><br/><p>Oh! Veldora and Ramiris were quite impressed, and they imitated her.</p><br/><p>As Veldora had already swallowed his tablet, he put Ramiris\u2019s tablet into his solid food and mixed it. Then they tasted it together.</p><br/><p>As for the result\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? It\u2019s not bad at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho. Very interesting. It sends false information to your tongue and makes you think it has taste. I think it would be quite fun to research this as a gag toy.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were both quite excited by this new food experience.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

First, Clown, what was that pathetic attempt at nuclear physics?</p><br/><p>Clown: I\u2019m a Clown. I don\u2019t read or check my information. I just mention the first thing that pops into my head!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: So, basically, you\u2019re saying that we shouldn\u2019t trust you?</p><br/><p>Clown: Check my work! Clowns act in a way so that people make fun of them!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: I think that should be laughing at them\u2026 but\u2026 demon lard?</p><br/><p>Clown: Oh, you\u2019re talking about that spot where I wrote \u201cthe demon lard is out for conquest\u201d? That\u2019s exactly as it should\u2019ve been!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Haha. No. This is what happens when I have you proofread after I translate. I really should just leave the editing to AK.</p><br/><p>Clown: But\u2026 but\u2026 I add all the humor! You know how long it takes to translate all the subtle jokes the author makes?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: You do none of that! I\u2019m the one who does that!</p><br/><p>Clown: Sure\u2026 you keep telling yourself that. But all the readers know, the Clown is the funny one here.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Fine! Let\u2019s have the readers decide! We\u2019ll both tell a joke, and the better one wins!</p><br/><p>Clown: Okay! What did the little fish say when he swam into a wall? DAM!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Here\u2019s mine:BBC reports that two pedestrian died in a collision. But I don\u2019t get it\u2026 how fast were they walking?!</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Forest Disturbance Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 28 \u2013 Jobs</p><br/><p>Making new friends is good and all, but will everyone get along?</p><br/><p>I had such a worry for a bit, but it was quickly dispelled.</p><br/><p>The ogres who have evolved into Oni.</p><br/><p>Perhaps as they evolve closer to their ancestors they\u2019ll unlock some special powers.</p><br/><p>I know I said that it seemed like their powers surpassed A rank, but as their powers stabilize, they could end up falling down to A-.</p><br/><p>Even so, they have clearly become very strong.</p><br/><p>And furthermore, in a battle, perhaps more than physical prowess, special abilities are the key to victory.</p><br/><p>I, myself, defeated Ifrit thanks to abilities.</p><br/><p>So I must admit, I am rather interested in what kind of abilities their bodies hold.</p><br/><p>Also, because of the evolution, the clothing they wore doesn\u2019t fit them at all.</p><br/><p>Since their bodies shrunk (though they are still bigger than the goblins) the sizes are too big.</p><br/><p>Their armor broken, and their weapons chipped and cracked.</p><br/><p>Curiously, they had dressed looking like soldiers fleeing from a battlefield.</p><br/><p>And since their sense of style I found curious, I decided to ask</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! Some 400 years ago, a young lad wandered into our village.</p><br/><p>The villagers were suspicious, but the Chief warmly welcomed him.</p><br/><p>Around the same time, a lesser dragon was rampaging in the forest. After expressing his gratitude, the lad defeated the dragon.</p><br/><p>The villagers hallowed his name, and passed down his praise to us.</p><br/><p>We began imitating the lad\u2019s attire, and that has been how we dressed ever since.\u300d</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>They imitated his equipment and successfully recreated it?</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, you recreated the equipment yourselves?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs you say. The lad had taught us various techniques, and through trial and error, we learned them. Kurobee, for example, is a blacksmith, and specializes in swords.\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh! To think that we already have someone to make swords\u2026</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s quickly introduce him to Kaijin.</p><br/><p>Since they\u2019ve already met yesterday, the discussion didn\u2019t take too long.</p><br/><p>In fact, as if they had known each for years, they quickly started producing new weapons.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s leave it to them.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there was something surprising!</p><br/><p>This world also has silk products.</p><br/><p>Most of clothing I\u2019ve seen so far were made from something that looks like hemp. Goblins\u2019 original clothing, for example.</p><br/><p>Well, whether it actually is hemp or not, I wouldn\u2019t know, but it certainly looks like it.</p><br/><p>But I digress. About silk.</p><br/><p>That is something that can be harvested from a Hell Moth\u2013a monster living near the Ogres\u2019 village. Well, to be more precise, it\u2019s from the pupa.</p><br/><p>If the larva grows into a hell moth, it is a powerful monster with bewitching powder that is ranked B; however, during its transformation, it is perfectly harmless.</p><br/><p>So you look for cocoons and gather those.</p><br/><p>Shuna is an expert at this, and has been called the fabric princess.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s introduce her to Garm and Doldo.</p><br/><p>Garm is in charge of everyday clothing and underwear.</p><br/><p>Doldo focuses more on dyes and high class attire.</p><br/><p>While we cannot make those yet, we are making arrangements to produce them eventually.</p><br/><p>As for hunting the cocoons\u2013we left that to the goblin cavalry.</p><br/><p>And while they\u2019re at it, they\u2019ll capture some larva to breed in the village.</p><br/><p>As I don\u2019t know much about silkworm cultivation, this may just end up succeeding through trial and error.</p><br/><p>However, as we may eventually get some decent clothing, the pain may be worth it.</p><br/><p>About my steel thread pile\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI leave it to you!\u201d I told Shuna, and handed it over.</p><br/><p>\u300cGot it! I\u2019ll make you proud, Rimuru-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>She answered with a bright blush.</p><br/><p>Adorable. She must be at that age where she is happy to be depended on.</p><br/><p>As an ogre princess she probably hadn\u2019t worked with cloth besides as a hobby.</p><br/><p>So even a bit of responsibility seems to make her happy.</p><br/><p>The dwarf brothers are also happy to be working together with her.</p><br/><p>Just please, don\u2019t touch her\u2026</p><br/><p>Unlike how she looks, that girl\u2019s frighteningly strong!</p><br/><p>Probably, if they try touching her ass, they won\u2019t be seeing the sun rise again.</p><br/><p>These two are pretty perverted, so it makes me worry.</p><br/><p>Well, the only reason I can worry about them is my lack of sexual desire.</p><br/><p>If I had it, I\u2019d have to worry about my myself over any other person.</p><br/><p>Cause she\u2019s so damn adorable!</p><br/><p>Truly an Oni-hime (TL note: hime meaning princess).</p><br/><p>You\u2019d be risking your life each time you\u2019d flirt with her.</p><br/><p>\u300cShuna-sama. Shuna-sama has found employment?</p><br/><p>Please calm your worries for I shall devote myself to Rimuru-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion pushed herself between me and Shuna.</p><br/><p>It looked as if sparks were flying between them\u2026 nah! I was probably just seeing some optical illusion.</p><br/><p>\u300cUfufu. How could that be if I shall be the one to care for Rimuru-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPerish the thought, Hime-sama, I shall not let it come to that! I personally shall fully devote myself to Rimuru-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>*Bachibachibachi* (Lightning sparks)</p><br/><p>See? They\u2019re perfectly civil!</p><br/><p>And besides, I require no one\u2019s care.</p><br/><p>Having lived alone for a long time, I can manage all household duties.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 let\u2019s take our leave.</p><br/><p>Is what I wanted to do\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama! Between myself and Shion, which would you fancy at Your side?\u300d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t let me run away.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yeah. Shuna has her weaving, right? So I\u2019ll depend on you when you\u2019re free, maybe?\u300d</p><br/><p>Depend regarding what?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t get it. Shuna, on other hand,</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood!! I have been favored, right!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ah, yeah. That\u2019s right. Let\u2019s leave it at that.</p><br/><p>\u300cRight! Glad to have you!\u300d</p><br/><p>She smiled and nodded at my words. Cute.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, for the time being, please leave Rimuru-sama to me, Hime-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c(Tch.) Please take care of our lord!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c(Fufu.) I live to serve!\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, the conversation grew heavy.</p><br/><p>At that moment , it felt as if the temperature dropped in the room\u2026 but I probably imagined it.</p><br/><p>You know, there are plenty things in this world to which you absolutely should say: I probably imagined it! This was one of them.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Together with Shion we walked around to oversee the construction.</p><br/><p>Speaking of, what are the remaining three up to?</p><br/><p>They were together with us up until a little bit ago\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cHakurou-sama was our martial instructor. The strongest swordsman in the royal guard, surely he went to confirm the city\u2019s defenses.</p><br/><p>Benimaru-sama and Souei seem to have gone to check their abilities.</p><br/><p>They are rivals and best friends. I believe they desire to test their new strength.\u300d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Certainly, even I understood how important it is to check your abilities.</p><br/><p>And Hakurou is a swordsman, huh. Really should have him teach me.</p><br/><p>But if he\u2019s busy checking the village, asking him for training will have to wait.</p><br/><p>Kurobee and the rest as also busy making armor and swords, so that should be fine. But really, can\u2019t wait to get a sword.</p><br/><p>I really want to imagine an army of goblins armed with swords. However, in actual combat, a spear is surely a better option.</p><br/><p>We went to look for Benimaru and Souei.</p><br/><p>Or rather, we went to the area where two great auras clashed. A plain in the direction of the cave.</p><br/><p>It was a battle like you\u2019d see in a manga.</p><br/><p>The red and blue aura would intertwine and fight for dominance.</p><br/><p>The earth split and the heavens cracked? That\u2019s how intense their fight felt.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. So these are Oni\u2026!</p><br/><p>Their armor crumbled from the strength of their blows. Not that it could protect them in the first place.</p><br/><p>Their swords broke, but they continued the fight barehanded\u2013in what resembled karate, with set techniques and rules. It was not an amateurs\u2019 brawl.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Um\u2026 they were ogres, right?</p><br/><p>Their motions were so fluid that I wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected of young master. Souei is also splendid. In our martial arts, barehanded skills serve as the foundation for mastery of the sword.\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what she said. The sword is an extension of your body; thus, first master the body\u2026</p><br/><p>These words were passed down in the village from the young lad who defeated the dragon.</p><br/><p>Masters of martial arts ogres\u2013if adventurers encounter them\u2026 I wonder how many unfortunate adventurers met such a fate. Let\u2019s offer them a prayer.</p><br/><p>Having noticed me, the two immediately stopped their fight, and rushed over.</p><br/><p>No injuries on either of them.</p><br/><p>If anything, they look like they\u2019ve been playing catch or something.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, I humbly thank you for this wonderful power!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWith this power, I shall turn the orcs into a sea of blood in Your name!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yeah. Though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>\u300cPromising words! I\u2019ll leave it to you. Well, we still need the goblins to gather more information, though.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHas scouting been going poorly?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, the goblins are excellent, but there are many dangers associated with approaching too closely.\u300d</p><br/><p>Right. For the sake of intelligence, I had sent out scouts.</p><br/><p>However, as some orcs may be especially careful, I strictly ordered the scouts to avoid detection.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing my explanation, Souei said</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, in that case, I shall go on reconnaissance. Please order me! \u300d</p><br/><p>Looks like he has confidence in his espionage skills.</p><br/><p>Perhaps now that he has evolved, the powerful Oni Souei may gather better intel than the goblins.</p><br/><p>If anything, he looks cool-headed, so he probably won\u2019t do anything rash.</p><br/><p>Maybe I can leave it to him.</p><br/><p>\u300cCan I leave it to you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! I hear and obey!\u300d</p><br/><p>The moment he answered his figure vanished from sight.</p><br/><p>Shadow movement.</p><br/><p>I see he has obtained a wonderful skill.</p><br/><p>With effort, I should also be able to acquire it. Seems like I have another thing I need to practice for.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry for using your friend\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is of no problem. We must show results with the power you bestowed upon us!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026 the orcs are your sworn enemies, after all. The day we fight them shall come; still your rage until then!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. If there is anything I can do, please give me your command. I live to become your hands and feet!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Is that so. Your words relieve my fears! By the way, did you find the goblins capable?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat I did. You had mentioned making a country here? Rimuru-sama as our monarch, Rigurdo as the Prime Minister? I fear I understand little in politics, but please leave the military matters to me.\u300d</p><br/><p>While we were conversing thus,</p><br/><p>\u300cHo ho ho. Young master, you intend to put my old bones to use?</p><br/><p>However, if it be for Rimuru-sama\u2019s sake, then I shall force this old body to work!\u300d</p><br/><p>With such words, Hakurou had joined the conversation.</p><br/><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed his presence at all. Nor his body temperature.</p><br/><p>Oi oi\u2026.</p><br/><p>Had he struck me now, I would have been hit once without any warning\u2026</p><br/><p>This is what they call a master\u2026!</p><br/><p>In a better time, or perhaps had he been born as a human, he would probably be called a Sword Saint or something.</p><br/><p>Nameless, never having gone out into the world, this grandpa (ogre) quietly polished his sword skills.</p><br/><p>I can see how he\u2019d be the strongest among them.</p><br/><p>\u300cBenimaru\u2026 are you stronger than Hakurou-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFu. Rimuru-sama, your joke puts me at an awkward position. This old timer, rather, Hakurou is the strongest man in the royal guard.</p><br/><p>He even surpassed my father. And besides, he is of a mixed race with the blood of the young human warrior flowing through him.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs he said. My ancestor was none other than the master swordsman Araki Byakuya!\u300d</p><br/><p>Japanese, huh.</p><br/><p>Seems like from the time of the katana.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, in that case, you are a samurai, aren\u2019t you?\u300d</p><br/><p>A single, casual word caused it.</p><br/><p>Magical energy escaped from Hakurou\u2019s body, mixed with that of his surrounding, and then reassembled.</p><br/><p>The amount of energy in his body did not change. However, its quality did.</p><br/><p>I forgot about it. Evolution due to class change, huh.</p><br/><p>A middle aged oni, but I seem to have reinvigorated him\u2026 now he looks as if in the prime of his life.</p><br/><p>Well, he also looks shocked at the change in his body. I\u2019ve done it again.</p><br/><p>To think that just a single word of mine could have such an effect.</p><br/><p>While his body was still adjusting to the increase in magical energy, it seems to have found the samurai class as appropriate to attune to.</p><br/><p>I just pray he hadn\u2019t become stronger than me.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood for you. From today on, you are a samurai. Samurai live by their loyalty. Serve Benimaru well!\u300d</p><br/><p>So I exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a second, I always want to be made into a sa-mu-ra-i.\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru said while looking at me with eyes full of determination.</p><br/><p>He really is like a stereotypical warrior.</p><br/><p>But to ask now of all time\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI can do that, but, are you fine with not becoming a village chief?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou speak those words at such a late hour! I have chosen to serve beneath You. I have pledged my loyalty to you. Again, I offer you my loyalty, please recognize me as a your samurai!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI, too, ask this of you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion as well, huh.</p><br/><p>If it has come to this, I guess I\u2019ll just have to bite the bullet.</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand. From now on, you are samurai! Live for my sake!\u300d</p><br/><p>I feel like I\u2019ve said this yesterday as well\u2026 how embarrassing.</p><br/><p>But these guys\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cAs You command!!! We pledge our entire lives to You!!!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Without a hint of embarrassment, they pledged themselves to me.</p><br/><p>By the way, I gave Kurobee the Blacksmith profession, and Shuna the Shrine Maiden class.</p><br/><p>But Kurobee\u2026 though his power decreased as a result, he showed me terrifying skill at forging swords.</p><br/><p>I should ask him to craft me a sword soon.</p><br/><p>Shuna seemed to have been able to use black magic since the beginning, but becoming a Shrine Maiden seems to have revealed some secret arts to her.</p><br/><p>Unlike magic, it\u2019s not something she can teach other people.</p><br/><p>Though if she acquires some seemingly useful skill, I\u2019ll definitely ask to analyze it.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t matter that she can\u2019t teach it to other people. I have [Predator], after all!</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll quickly learn it the moment she gets it.</p><br/><p>Fufufu. As for the guy who already has shadow movement, I know exactly what will fit him.</p><br/><p>Right! What every child loves\u2026 ninja!</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s him, he could probably land a critical hit sending heads flying!</p><br/><p>Actually\u2026 Hakurou can already do that\u2026 scary.</p><br/><p>Just standing by him in human form makes me imagine my head flying off\u2026 how worrisome.</p><br/><p>I have to further consider their strength.</p><br/><p>Now that they have gotten stronger, I have to think of methods of improving myself.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t keep depending on abilities forever.</p><br/><p>Seems like I have much to learn for the upcoming battle!</p><br/><p>Then, it happened. Revealing exactly what I needed to prepare.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

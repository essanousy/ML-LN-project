And since I did not have an overly particular personality, it was mostly convenient.</p><br/><p>However, there now arose a very big problem.</p><br/><p>I had come to a place called the \u2018Night Butterfly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kaijin had brought me here to celebrate and as a thank you.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have any interest really, but Kaijin would not back down, and so I had no choice.</p><br/><p>Really, I had no interest in it at all. It was Kaijin who forced me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Alright, I will admit it.</p><br/><p>I was actually very interested. It had been a long time since I last had a drink with pretty girls, and so I entered the place quite happily.</p><br/><p>But then!</p><br/><p>No matter how much I drank, I could not get drunk. You could say it was an incredibly serious problem. Kaijin had gone through all the trouble of bringing me here. But now the fun was halved. I tried my hardest to get drunk, but I couldn\u2019t even taste the drink. I was dauntless and unyielding in my attempt, but it was no use.</p><br/><p>However, there was more to enjoy than the drinks.</p><br/><p>I was a man who was quick to adapt. I would not give up so easily!</p><br/><p>And so I thought that I would like to enjoy the company of beautiful elf girls that would do justice to the name, \u2018Night Butterfly.\u2019</p><br/><p>And here arose yet another problem.</p><br/><p>I had not had any complaints about my slime body up until now, but now I had nothing but complaints.</p><br/><p>My next issue was the lack of hands. Here I was with these pretty elf girls, and yet I could not touch them. It was a huge problem indeed.</p><br/><p>Their lithe, delicate arms wrapped around me as their ample breasts pressed against my body.</p><br/><p>Wonderful! Was I in heaven!? I wanted to shout out loud. That\u2019s how amazing the situation was\u2026</p><br/><p>But tragically, I had no hands. And so there was nothing else that I could do.</p><br/><p>I thought back on all the animals I had preyed on, and wondered if I couldn\u2019t create a hand or tentacle or any other organ to express my feelings.</p><br/><p>Then I thought of using the unique skill Great Sage. And so I sent out the order.</p><br/><p>However\u2014</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;Answer: Insufficient data. Creation of the specified limb has failed.&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>How useless!! So much for \u2018Great Sage\u2019! It was completely unreliable when I needed it the most.</p><br/><p>But then I recalled all the monsters that I had preyed on\u2014snakes, centipedes, spiders, bats, lizards, wolves\u2026indeed, none of them had that ability.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, I would have to give up being able to squeeze any breasts.</p><br/><p>But! I was not the kind of man to give up here.</p><br/><p>If I couldn\u2019t squeeze anything, surely I could still enjoy the sweet-smelling scent of these elf ladies.</p><br/><p>Being surrounded by breasts while enjoying the smell of heaven. That was the best way for an adult man to live.</p><br/><p>And so I would go about doing just that.</p><br/><p>I took in as much air as I could. And here I was able to reach the world of aroma.</p><br/><p>This was when the skill, \u2018Super Olfaction,\u2019 which I had received from the Fanged Wolves, came in handy.</p><br/><p>And so I continued to smell the beautiful elves as a way of satisfying my desire to know more.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;Answer: The substance is a mixture of perfume, the female hormone estrogen, oxytocin\u2026&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Stop! That\u2019s not what I meant!!</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to know those kinds of details\u2026 Knowing all of that will decrease the beauty.</p><br/><p>Was it only a \u2018Great Sage\u2019 in name? The skill was completely useless.</p><br/><p>And so explained to the \u2018Great Sage.\u2019</p><br/><p>While I did want to smell the scents and know its wonders, I did not want to know too much.</p><br/><p>There was just a right amount. There was always a line you shouldn\u2019t cross.</p><br/><p>Things you couldn\u2019t know even if you wanted to. Things you couldn\u2019t see even if you wanted to.</p><br/><p>That was the great secret.</p><br/><p>People lost interest in things if they knew too much. And so you had to go until you almost arrive, but then restrain yourself from going any further.</p><br/><p>You could say it was the art of only getting a brief glimpse of something.</p><br/><p>By suppressing your intellectual curiosity, you can gain much more excitement. It\u2019s an adult thing that only professionals can manage.</p><br/><p>I said all of this and more to the \u2018Great Sage.\u2019</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;\u2026Answer: I understand.&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>For real? That\u2019s the Great Sage for you.</p><br/><p>My passion must have got through, as it understood me now.</p><br/><p>The Great Sage was wonderful after that.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.It allowed me to sense things right up until that point when I became desperate for more.</p><br/><p>To be precise, I was able to understand their emotions by their smell.</p><br/><p>It was emotions such as joy or anger. But these things were worth a thousand pieces of gold in this kind of place.</p><br/><p>I was able to establish myself as a type of king here.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t just about the smell.</p><br/><p>My sight as well. Things that you cannot see were recreated as images in my brain.</p><br/><p>Currently, I was still relying on \u2018Magic Perception\u2019 to see.</p><br/><p>It was surprisingly difficult to recreate the eyes alone, and not only was it easier to use \u2018Magic Perception\u2019 to create the images, but it had a wider view.</p><br/><p>I was able to use this wide view to see things that people shouldn\u2019t. For instance, it would be possible to see under people\u2019s skirts.</p><br/><p>However, that golden triangle was tightly protected by the elf ladies, and I was never able to see anything through the faithfully recreated images.</p><br/><p>\u2018Great Sage.\u2019\u2026was almost frighteningly accurate.</p><br/><p>And so, my tireless pursuit in this place of the night continued. That is, until some people came to hinder us.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

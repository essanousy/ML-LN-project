A suddent Invitation</p><br/><p>The operation to subjugate Yuuki ended in a failure.</p><br/><p>But taking advantage of what we could, we reestablished the Freedom Association in our favor.</p><br/><p>Thanks to our efforts in removing Yuuki and his observers, the transition was smooth.</p><br/><p>In the end, a single templar was left in each branch, and thus a new control system was created with the Western Saint\u2019s Church at the head.</p><br/><p>And the Church beginning changing its language and structure to more of a \u201cspirit worship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then there\u2019s the Free Arbitration Committee.</p><br/><p>A new organization Freedom Association and the Western Saints created.</p><br/><p>Unlike the Council\u2013the International Council, I mean\u2013which operates by electing delegates, the Committee\u2013Free Arbitration Committee\u2013is composed of Freedom Association guild masters.</p><br/><p>Once it was established it became a method for countries to negotiate on neutral grounds.</p><br/><p>Sakaguchi Hinata was appointed as the first Committee Chair.</p><br/><p>And since the Church and Templars refused to run for this office, her appointment was rather welcoming.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, according to the information the templars collected, there were no visible dissenters at the moment at the branches. I mean, we demon lords\u2013Ramiris and I in particular\u2013tend to operate behind the scenes, but there\u2019s a surprising lack of opposition even when we act openly.</p><br/><p>Thus, after establishing this organization, we were able to join the countries surrounding Jura forest with two unions\u2013the Council and the Committee.</p><br/><p>You need strong bonds between nations in a large union.</p><br/><p>That was the state of the world a month after the failed subjugation attempt.</p><br/><p>Of course, while everyone was busy establishing these new organization I was not just playing around.</p><br/><p>Three days after the failed subjugation attempt he appeared.</p><br/><p>Ripping through Ingracia Kingdom\u2019s barrier, clad in silver armor, he appeared,</p><br/><p>Silver Knight Alrose.</p><br/><p>Introducing himself as a servant of the Platinum Devil Leon Cromwell, he handed me a letter.</p><br/><p>It was an invitation.</p><br/><p>As he had promised, he invited me over.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 why now?</p><br/><p>\u300cMy master wishes to discuss matters regarding the \u201cHero\u201d with you, Rimuru-sama\u300d</p><br/><p>After Alrose said so, I got an idea of what was in store.</p><br/><p>The letter came after the hero was fully awakened\u2013surely that was the cause.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Leon knows something about Chloe. It seems they crossed blades once, so perhaps there is something he knows that we do not.</p><br/><p>I decided to accept the invitation. In any case, I\u2019ve yet to complain on Shizu-san\u2019s behalf.</p><br/><p>Though it all depends on his intentions from now on.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright. I\u2019m accepting the invitation\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYour kind words are wasted upon us. My master shall be most pleased. Please, this way\u300d</p><br/><p>Alrose had a helmet on the whole time so I have no idea what kind of face he was making, but he certainly sounded happy about it; oh, and he teleported away.</p><br/><p>Instant teleportation can be used by many high level devils. Even if he was using predetermined coordinates, it\u2019s still a big deal.</p><br/><p>By the way, those who can teleport to any place (even those they haven\u2019t visited) are overwhelmingly high existences. Even among my subordinates only Diablo can do it\u2026 probably. It\u2019s not a skill you can use unless you\u2019ve got a spiritual body.</p><br/><p>The way it works is: Shadow Step \u2013&gt; Spatial Transfer \u2013&gt; Teleport.</p><br/><p>You could also move using magic circles, but the previous three are skills, not magic.</p><br/><p>I have been using skills and magic interchangeably so I didn\u2019t even notice, but seems that there is a difference. I mean, Hinata said there was, and she must be right.</p><br/><p>Spatial transfer requires you to open a door and step into it to travel. It\u2019s not something you can use during combat. As for Teleportation magic, it instantaneously creates and executes a magic circle allowing for instant travel. It can be used to avoid enemy attacks and such, so those who can use teleport are rather strong.</p><br/><p>But since it\u2019s usually only limited to your starting point and a previously visited location, this skill by no means decides the opponent\u2019s skill.</p><br/><p>By the way, even the lowest spatial magic should be pretty instantaneous, so one can\u2019t let his guard down.</p><br/><p>The second Silver Knight Alrose disappeared a magic circle appeared where he stood. In other words, that\u2019s what I needed to use to get there.</p><br/><p>Magic knight, spatial magic master, and I bet he\u2019s pretty damn skilled with his teleport abilities.</p><br/><p>Damn you Leon, you\u2019ve got good subordinates.</p><br/><p>I guess I should go and bestow teleporting on Benimaru, Shion, and the rest.</p><br/><p>As I am now I feel I could bestow skills without a problem, and it may increase our war potential.</p><br/><p>So I thought while as Alrose disappeared.</p><br/><p>As a side note, Hinata can also teleport. But, since it uses so much magical energy, she can\u2019t at the moment.</p><br/><p>But considering her ability to do so chantlessly: I can finally appreciate her actual strength.</p><br/><p>Although she can no longer use her\u300eMathematician\u300fability, she\u2019s still a genius magician.</p><br/><p>She did become weaker, but not as much as she herself claims\u2026 though that\u2019s a secret for now.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>And thus I came.</p><br/><p>The land Leon rules is more of a continent than an island. It\u2019s surprisingly wide, and has towns divided into districts.</p><br/><p>Forest, Field, Lake, River, and Mountain districts.</p><br/><p>Every sector is protected via a magic circle.</p><br/><p>An artificially created land of nature and tranquility\u2013a magic city.</p><br/><p>That is the land of Demon Lord Leon Cromwell\u2013El Dorado.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo\u2026 this is kind of amazing\u300d</p><br/><p>I muttered.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, you are too kind. My master will be pleased to hear such praise\u300d</p><br/><p>Alrose replied happily as he guided us.</p><br/><p>Right now, his helmet is off and beautiful silver hair falls on his back.</p><br/><p>Though he looks like a girl, it\u2019s a guy. He is the Captain of the Magic Knights.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s no small wonder Leon trusts him so much.</p><br/><p>But, this country truly is build wonderfully. The streets glimmer as if made of gold.</p><br/><p>Every building was placed with care, and a spiral castle reaches into the heavens.</p><br/><p>If you looked from above, you would notice that a giant magic circle is created using the city itself. In other words, other than those who can look from above, the circle is invisible.</p><br/><p>The circle is supplied with energy from the citizens themselves. Such careful construction tickles my pride a bit.</p><br/><p>No question about it: Tempest is a beautiful country. But we did not incorporate magic into the land itself.</p><br/><p>And that bothers me a bit now.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, what is so amazing?\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion walking behind me asked.</p><br/><p>Even though she should have an overhead view, she has not noticed. Just shows how elaborate this construction is.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis city creates a single giant magic circle.</p><br/><p>The city is blessed with \u201cCounter Magic\u201d and \u201cEnemy Radar\u201d as a result.</p><br/><p>It will alert them if there are any intruders. Though it seals magic attacks, that which enters it probably bounces back.</p><br/><p>Just imagine being attacked with large scale magic: it\u2019s an automatic win for the city.</p><br/><p>I wonder if we should copy it in Tempest?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? That does sound amazing, though I don\u2019t really get it\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, as expected. Though you have not looked from above, you have noticed so much.</p><br/><p>Nothing could be hidden from your eyes. You are correct; this city prides itself in its absolute magical barrier\u300d</p><br/><p>Alrose proudly replied.</p><br/><p>Shion seriously doesn\u2019t get it. I guess she just doesn\u2019t recognize magic. So it\u2019s not surprising that she can\u2019t understand it.</p><br/><p>I wonder how hard it was to create a city that encompassed two magic circles.</p><br/><p>Just creating one would have certainly been a pain, but here they have two; and he had to account for future development too. It\u2019s too amazing.</p><br/><p>But, this is a way for me to have some fun. I will definitely implement the same in my country.</p><br/><p>Once we left the magic circle room, the hallways were made of class.</p><br/><p>The distant scenery was filled with flowing rivers and waterfalls in beautiful designs.</p><br/><p>Damn him! This city is pretty.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t help but accept it, but it does make me jealous\u2013which then fuels my creativity!</p><br/><p>And after walking ten minutes,</p><br/><p>We were guided into one of the rooms in the Royal Palace.</p><br/><p>The items are clearly luxury ones, and certainly of good quality. Color pattern is white and gold.</p><br/><p>Certainly not poorly designed\u2013he\u2019s got good taste.</p><br/><p>I guess it\u2019s meant not to intimidate people into a heart attack. And just as the exterior is decorated in beautiful gold, so is the interior.</p><br/><p>In short: it doesn\u2019t make a visitor nervous, and that\u2019s something I feel I could easily imitate.</p><br/><p>As for Shion: the moment she walked in, she sat down, started munching on snacks and sipping tea; completely unaffected.</p><br/><p>Hmm? Shouldn\u2019t it be the other way around? Shouldn\u2019t I be like that?</p><br/><p>Ignore that. If you notice that kind of thing you lose.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, these sweets are really good. And not poisoned, please have some!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion said handing me some sweets.</p><br/><p>To think that that cook Shion would be talking about poison\u2026 what irony. Besides, poison doesn\u2019t affect me.</p><br/><p>And like that we waited for 10 minutes,</p><br/><p>Until this country\u2019s ruler, Leon Cromwell appeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you wait long? Thank you for accepting an invitation on such short notice\u300d</p><br/><p>He said and sat in a chair in front of me.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s dressed even rougher than I remembered, and he speaks plainly.</p><br/><p>Crossing his legs, he certainly looks like he belongs in a movie.</p><br/><p>Though Alrose is certainly handsome, Leon can only be described as beautiful.</p><br/><p>Of course, that doesn\u2019t please me too much.</p><br/><p>But leaving the matter of his manhood aside, let\u2019s return to the main question.</p><br/><p>I told him about Shizu\u2019s last moments.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so\u2026 She lived longer than I had predicted\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon replied plainly.</p><br/><p>But that did not infuriate me. Perhaps because I had noticed something,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, did you have Ifrit possess her to save her life?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWho knows? I may have done something of the sort; I don\u2019t remember\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon replied closign his eyes.</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s a crappy actor.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph\u2026 whatever. I got it.</p><br/><p>Oh, and Ramiris mentioned something interesting: you\u2019re a crybaby?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I said so, Leon\u2019s face twisted in despair.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat damn brat\u2026 next time I\u2019ll rip her wings off\u300d</p><br/><p>He said angrily.</p><br/><p>Well, seems like it wasn\u2019t a lie.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll let her know.</p><br/><p>Oh, and you said something about summoning a special individual, is that right?\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s when the room got silent.</p><br/><p>After some time had passed, Leon gravely opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat is so.</p><br/><p>And that matter is connected to the reason I asked for you today\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon said and glanced at Shion.</p><br/><p>I nodded,</p><br/><p>\u300cShion, this conversation is a little complicated.</p><br/><p>Please go help out Alrose with something, could you?\u300d</p><br/><p>I said asking Shion to leave.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy all means. Shion-san, please help me in the preparation room\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon directed Alrose to say so with a glance.</p><br/><p>Shion silently nodded and followed Alrose out of the room.</p><br/><p>And thus I was alone with Leon in the room.</p><br/><p>After confirming this fact,</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you know a little girl named Chloe?\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon asked.</p><br/><p>Yup, everything is connected.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t surprised that Leon said this name.</p><br/><p>Perhaps I had predicted such an outcome after listening to Hinata and Ruminas.</p><br/><p>That explains who requested Yuuki\u2019s services for the summoning and why the conditions were as they were.</p><br/><p>That is, why children were being summoned and why most were girls&gt;</p><br/><p>He was looking for Chloe from the very beginning: Shizu-san and the rest were simply a by-product.</p><br/><p>But what came afterward from Leon\u2019s lips completely blew my mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

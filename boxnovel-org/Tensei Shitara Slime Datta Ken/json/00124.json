Birth of a Hero</p><br/><p>When Nicholas calmed down, the rest of the story was explained.</p><br/><p>Fritz regained his composure, and explained in detail what had happened to Hinata.</p><br/><p>The children were also brought here from Glenda, and were listening to Fritz\u2019s explanation. They should have been tired, but were they listening attentively.</p><br/><p>They were fed in Glenda, albeit not a proper remedy for their mental fatigue. Nonetheless, without tears or complaints they recited their observations.</p><br/><p>Their behavior made Fritz believe that Hinata\u2019s choices were not a mistake.</p><br/><p>Nicholas was mulling over the things that were said.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, they now confirmed that that Freedom Association\u2019s Kagurazaka Yuuki is indeed their enemy.</p><br/><p>Though they still didn\u2019t have a clear picture on how powerful or widespread his brainwashing is, considering that the Demon Lord Kazalim is his subordinate makes him a rather dangerous threat.</p><br/><p>Next, the reason for Hinata\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>Following the battle with Demon Lord Rimuru, Hinata was able to dispel the Parasitic thought manipulation, \u201cCrystal of Curses,\u201d and decided to attempt a rescue mission to save the children, as to prevent them to be similarly manipulated.</p><br/><p>However, Yuki had set a trap with the children as bait, and a battle started right on the spot.</p><br/><p>Her opponent was a hero. After hiding for several</p><br/><p>decades, the hero engaged in mortal combat with Hinata.</p><br/><p>Although Nicolas was skeptical, but judging from Fritz and the Children\u2019s testimony there was no mistake.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there was information obtained from their conversations.</p><br/><p>Yuuki intended to plunge the world into chaos and become its sole ruler.</p><br/><p>Therefore he carried out multiple summons and was involved in some sort of negotiations.</p><br/><p>One should also conclude that he and his conspirators share a common goal.</p><br/><p>Then there\u2019s the fact that Freedom Association\u2019s Sub-master is the Demon Lord Kazalim.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the Pope of the Holy Empire of Ruberius was not god\u2019s agent, but a mere marionette.</p><br/><p>Even the Western Saint\u2019s Church was obeying not the will of a True God Ruminas, but that of a Demon Lord\u2019s.</p><br/><p>In other word, the god Ruminas, was actually a demon lord\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>However, he hesitated in accepting this revelation. Hinata, at least, seemed to believe it, but then there was also the many hundreds of years of peace and prosperity.</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t just say that it was all the work of a Demon Lord and expect people to just accept it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, a hero was in the hands of a demon lord and is being manipulated by Yuuki\u2026 such sacrilege.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t something they could easily disclose, and even if it did, it would only lead to a movement to free the hero.</p><br/><p>And that hero has just proven her heroism (absolute strength) in the battle with Hinata.</p><br/><p>From the perspective of the Knights, Fritz, and Nicholas, Hinata was beyond human in strength, and yet she was defeated without resorting to any special skill.</p><br/><p>The only existence who could overwhelm Hinata who has gotten only stronger after her battle with Demon Lord Rimuru is the hero herself.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut\u2026 to think that it was a hero\u2026</p><br/><p>If we were to reveal her as our enemy it would turn every country against the church.</p><br/><p>Not a demon lord but a hero.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t get any worse can it\u2026 And since it\u2019s Yuuki, he\u2019ll definitely take advantage of this information\u300d</p><br/><p>In reply to the remark of the Holy Knight leader Leonard, the holy knights nodded with meek faces.</p><br/><p>However, is that really so? Nicolas repeatedly thought.</p><br/><p>Hinata had manage everything once. Nicholas only had to leave it in her hands\u2026</p><br/><p>Sadness and despair swirled inside Nicholas heart threatening to overwhelm him, yet he repressed it with his will alone.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, in that case he would have long proclaimed that Ruminas had kidnapped a hero.</p><br/><p>Considering that he hasn\u2019t means that he currently lacks the strength to oppose us\u300d</p><br/><p>Nicolas said.</p><br/><p>Hinata can\u2019t be relied on anymore. So he had to decide himself.</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, a hero\u2019s strength was overwhelming.</p><br/><p>Yuki may have dominated the Hero, then couldn\u2019t he counter a demon lord?</p><br/><p>Actually, just what kind of demon lord is Ruminas?\u300d</p><br/><p>Fritz who has actually witnessed the clash between Hinata and the Hero asked.</p><br/><p>If the hero could overwhelm Hinata, wouldn\u2019t that mean the demon lord is even stronger?</p><br/><p>As per the previous question, does the Demon Lord Ruminas even exist?</p><br/><p>Nicholas, in response to that question, explored the depths of his own knowledge and memory and found an answer.</p><br/><p>\u300cFumu, Well the demon lord valentine\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>There is a book within the western church which summarized ancient literatures.\u300d</p><br/><p>Nicolas began reciting\u2026</p><br/><p>Ten Great Demon Kings, originally there were three</p><br/><p>Guy Crimson, the \u201cLord of Darkness\u201d</p><br/><p>Milim Nava, \u201cDestroy,\u201d strongest there could be</p><br/><p>Ramiris of the Labyrinth, plunging all to madness</p><br/><p>Their fame had spread from sea to sea</p><br/><p>Stories told of burning cities and death abound,</p><br/><p>Fear of them even in the legends was found.</p><br/><p>As the tale had told, Ramiris had fallen from grace,</p><br/><p>Once shared in the Holy Spirit, but it abandoned</p><br/><p>And the warring Nava and Crimson in that place,</p><br/><p>Peace between the two she demanded.</p><br/><p>These three are like gods, beyond all reason</p><br/><p>Against whom you\u2019d never think of treason</p><br/><p>Then came others, though unlike the first,</p><br/><p>Dagruel who would shake the ground</p><br/><p>Valentine who terrorized the night.</p><br/><p>Such were the names these fiends found.</p><br/><p>Hallowed as Demon Lords, such was their right.</p><br/><p>Dagruel guarded the gates of heaven in the land of the dead,</p><br/><p>Into a demon lord he mutated after magic he was fed. [1]</p><br/><p>These two were famous demon lords.</p><br/><p>As to the demon lord in question\u2013Ruminas</p><br/><p>That would probably be the Vampire princess Valentine.</p><br/><p>As the queen of the vampires, she had overwhelming magical power. An evildoer with an absolutely beautiful appearance.</p><br/><p>The city she ruled over, a beautiful flower of the night, Night Rose, was burned to cinders in a battle with Storm Dragon Veldora.</p><br/><p>And since then no one had seen Demon Lord Valentine again.</p><br/><p>Since no one had confirmed whether she had perished, she was still considered a part of the Great Ten Demon Lords\u2014Vampire Princess Valentine.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn other words, Demon Lord Valentine is playing the role of God Ruminas.</p><br/><p>There is another ancient demon lord: a fallen angel, but its name we do not know.</p><br/><p>As for the rest: the slayer of many, Lychan King Karion and Heavenly Frey, and the Golden Leon make up the new demon lords.</p><br/><p>There was also the manipulator Clayman, but he was destroyed by Demon Lord Rimuru\u2026.\u300d</p><br/><p>Having heard Nicholas\u2019 explanation the group came to the conclusion that the god Ruminas was none other than Demon Lord Valentine.</p><br/><p>Situation so dictated and the Templars did not voice any opposition.</p><br/><p>Thus this heavy revelation began to sink in.</p><br/><p>They had long worshipped a demon lord.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not something you can just laugh off. But there was also no use in getting angry or violent.</p><br/><p>Sitting in the Cathedral chamber Hinata established, those present honestly faced the truth.</p><br/><p>But not even Nicholas nor Leonard could accept it just yet. It was just beyond all reason.</p><br/><p>They would have been much happier if this all happened to be another of Yuuki\u2019s attempts to control their minds.</p><br/><p>But this thought only reveals the underlying problem.</p><br/><p>Yuuki is their enemy. There was no question about it, and Nicholas would never forgive that bastard.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThough she wasn\u2019t one of the original demon lords, Valentine was an ancient one\u2026</p><br/><p>But\u2026 a hero would probably win anyways.</p><br/><p>In other words, if Yuuki controls the hero, there\u2019s no reason for him to fear the demon lord, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Leonard stated, only increasing Nicholas\u2019 headaache.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Even as he was explaining it, Nicholas thought the same thing.</p><br/><p>Whether Yuuki would win is dubious, but a hero would definitely win. After all, she sealed the Storm Dragon who defeated Valentine.</p><br/><p>In that case\u2026</p><br/><p>It just wasn\u2019t the time to scatter the Empire by revealing the demon lord behind the curtain.</p><br/><p>Now that Hinata was defeated, there was no one to unify the Church. If the word of Ruminas\u2019 true nature got out, it would spell doom for that entire country.</p><br/><p>Whether Yuuki had read this far is unknown, but now he knew, and Nicholas was left without a card to play.</p><br/><p>Everyone present realized this fact and silence enveloped the room.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Freedom Association Master\u2019s next move will be bold, eh\u300d</p><br/><p>Nicholas murmured but no one answered.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>\u300cW-what is this?! What an ominous presence!! Friends, take arms!\u300d</p><br/><p>Leonard shouted and everyone drew their weapon.</p><br/><p>And then before everyone, the space distorted and beings appeared before them.</p><br/><p>Seven beings wearing faceless masks.</p><br/><p>And when they kneeled, another walked between them.</p><br/><p>A beautiful girl.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were a beautiful heterochroma, lit in a blue and red light.</p><br/><p>She was discussed by them just a second ago.</p><br/><p>Queen of the Night, Nightmare of the Night, Ruminas Valentine.</p><br/><p>She transported to the chambers using\u300eSpatial Movement\u300f.</p><br/><p>And to the people reflected in her bewitching eyes,</p><br/><p>\u300cStand down\u300d</p><br/><p>She said in a low yet reverberating voice.</p><br/><p>For the knights, even if the one before them was the Pope himself, none would profess to have thought it a good time to relax.</p><br/><p>But before this Demon Lord\u2019s presence none could disobey.</p><br/><p>Strength gone from their bodies, they dropped their blades and bowed before her.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, her mouth curved in a small smile revealing a pair of white fangs. She was indeed the Vampire Prinecss.</p><br/><p>And when her adorable mouth opened,</p><br/><p>\u300cHe who underestimates us. Thee means to say that we be vanquished by the hero\u2026 nay, perhaps I could see Chloe accomplishing that\u2026 by Yuuki?\u300d</p><br/><p>She declared.</p><br/><p>Nicholas felt his heart stop from her overwhelming presence and could no respond.</p><br/><p>(So t-this is a Demon Lord! S-she\u2019s too overwhelming!!)</p><br/><p>Fear nearly ripped his heart asunder, and everyone there felt the same.</p><br/><p>\u300cBe that as it may.</p><br/><p>Ye have discovered our place in the Holy Empire of Ruberion, we gather.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tis so, we are the God Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Perhaps a shame, but if that country falls apart there is no reason to stop it.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>We shall not be looked down upon. Besides, Chloe is ours.</p><br/><p>We shall bathe in Yuuki\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>What will ye do? If ye swear loyalty to us, I shall bless you with a chance to battle\u300d</p><br/><p>Nicholas considered it.</p><br/><p>There was no benefit in being enemies. Not that they could win.</p><br/><p>He had heard of Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s divine strength. The being before him was comparable.</p><br/><p>Actually, she is an ancient.</p><br/><p>So he should be even more wary of her.</p><br/><p>So should he swear loyalty? His heart opposed that choice.</p><br/><p>And not just him, but everyone else present felt the same.</p><br/><p>They would only swear loyalty to Sakaguchi Hinata.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Ruminas was stronger than Hinata, but the heart could not be so easily controlled.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnfortunately, Demon Lord Ruminas,</p><br/><p>Our loyalty is to Hinata alone.</p><br/><p>We have no wish to fight against you, but we ask you to understand that loyalty is a different matter entirely.</p><br/><p>We humbly beg your forgiveness\u300d</p><br/><p>Nicholas said while looking Ruminas in teh eye.</p><br/><p>Her eyes glittered,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? You would retain loyalty towards a corpse?\u300d</p><br/><p>Before Nicholas could respond,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t go killing me off that quickly\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The words came from behind Ruminas, the entrace to the chamber.</p><br/><p>Long black hair gathered in the back, wearing light equipment.</p><br/><p>A beautiful girl.</p><br/><p>The Hero stood there.</p><br/><p>\u300cChloe!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas declared happily.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry Ruminas, I\u2019m not Chloe right now. Right now it\u2019s Hinata.</p><br/><p>Well, the strength of my soul is already lost so it\u2019s just a greeting.</p><br/><p>On the way out, you see\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata said with a beautiful smile.</p><br/><p>\u300eHinata-sama!!\u300f</p><br/><p>As if they were suddenly cured of paralysis, the knights ran up to Hinata, and Nicholas ran up to hug her.</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, you are Hinata right now. How about Chloe?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cChloe is asleep. When we fought we were able to truly waken.</p><br/><p>My skills were integrated and power assimilated.</p><br/><p>Though it took a while, we seem to have fixed all distortions.</p><br/><p>You see, before I was summoned into this world, this body slept in Ruminas\u2019 care.</p><br/><p>And then Yuuki went ahead and awoke it, causing there to be two bodies for poor Chloe, reducing her to an unrecognizable spirit.</p><br/><p>Ruminas you yourself forgot the hero\u2019s name, didn\u2019t you?\u300d</p><br/><p>While hugged by Nicholas Hinata asked.</p><br/><p>And when Nicholas finally let go,</p><br/><p>\u300cSo we had Chloe kill the me of this world</p><br/><p>This was a predestined future that just had to happen.</p><br/><p>Hero Chloe would now awaken as a true hero.</p><br/><p>And I, assimilated into her, would use the spirit of time\u2019s power to leap back in time and raise the \u201cHero\u2019s egg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not at time of strife, but in time of peace.</p><br/><p>That is the Hero\u2019s Program.</p><br/><p>And now that my soul has been absorbed by the Chloe of today, the me who has journey for so long with Chloe has awakened.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, I am an extra existence and would soon disappear.</p><br/><p>Which is why I came to say goodbye to you worrywarts.\u300d[2]</p><br/><p>Hinata said with an expression full of affection.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus Hinata, Ruminas, and Nicholas talked for a bit.</p><br/><p>Since time was of essence, they discussed the current state of Hero Chloe.</p><br/><p>Chloe was under Yuuki\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she was bound by a contract upon awakening, so releasing her would prove difficult.</p><br/><p>Hinata herself was unable to undo the contract.</p><br/><p>This news greatly unnerved Ruminas.</p><br/><p>And to Ruminas,</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, there may be other options when we awaken as a hero.</p><br/><p>According to our contract we will be released when Yuuki makes three wishes.</p><br/><p>We cannot oppose him until he makes these three wishes.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no problem in revealing things like this though. There are things I can\u2019t mention though.</p><br/><p>Once he makes the third wish, we can rip him to shreds.</p><br/><p>Which is why he won\u2019t make the third wish, you see?</p><br/><p>In other words, he can\u2019t go around using the hero as he pleases.</p><br/><p>However, that man is bizarre.</p><br/><p>He seriously wishes to enjoy destroying this world.</p><br/><p>When I\u2019m freed, his plan will fail.</p><br/><p>However, he is dangerous. So do stay wary of him.</p><br/><p>Now then, it\u2019s time to go\u300d</p><br/><p>Having so said, the Hero (Hinata) stood.</p><br/><p>\u300cH-Hinata-sama\u300d</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t go, Nicholas wanted to say, but knew he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Choking on his words, he understood he would never again see her.</p><br/><p>But raising his fist,</p><br/><p>\u300cBe well!\u300d</p><br/><p>He declared with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu, be well, huh. You too Nicholas.</p><br/><p>All of you. Don\u2019t be reckless. And if you need anything, go see Rimuru.\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus Hinata said her final farewells.</p><br/><p>Soon her spirit would be devoured entirely by Chloe and disappear.</p><br/><p>Nothing could be done about that.</p><br/><p>Hinata completed her duty of raising the Hero\u2019s Egg inside Chloe.</p><br/><p>So she was satisfied.</p><br/><p>With her own arms and legs she saved many people and repaid her debt to Shizu-san.</p><br/><p>Her wish had come true. Anything beyond that would be pure greed.</p><br/><p>Now she only had to wait for the end to come inside Chloe\u2026</p><br/><p>And to Hinata,</p><br/><p>\u300cWait!\u300d</p><br/><p>A cold voice was heard.</p><br/><p>Ruminas stopped her.</p><br/><p>\u300cThee are fortunate.</p><br/><p>We shall test\u300eAsmodeus\u300fupon thee.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tis a skill that rules over life and death, and while \u2019tis impossible to recreate a lost soul, you have a soul and a body gathered here.</p><br/><p>We shall not fail.</p><br/><p>Are thee not a hero who would never give up?</p><br/><p>We shall not allow thee to give up!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing her words, Nicholas, Fritz, and the Knights started earnestly pleading with Hinata.</p><br/><p>Assailed by their puppy-eyes, Hinata was completely at loss.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu, hahahahaha!\u300d</p><br/><p>She laughed.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry. I just recalled that I hated giving up.</p><br/><p>Even to the point of clawing at my enemies. To think that I\u2019d be convinced by a demon lord!</p><br/><p>Well, even if you do succeed, I have already lost my original power\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She said with a troubled smile,</p><br/><p>\u300cStrength! In that case, I shall protect Hinata-sama, guide us!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis time I shall not fail in protecting you! I will not be defeated!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe need you!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Responding to their will, she nodded to Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Why did she suddenly suggest to do this, Hinata did not know.</p><br/><p>But now the fate of a single person was changed.</p><br/><p>\u300cRebirth!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas shouted, and two parts of Hinata\u2019s soul, from the hero of future and past, came together and were joined by Asmodeus.</p><br/><p>Asmodeus, the King of Lust.</p><br/><p>And thus Hinata was reborn and Hero Chloe was born without a foreign soul inside of her.</p><br/><p>A Hero with long black hair and eyes of divine beauty.</p><br/><p>Hinata and Chloe were now perfectly separated.</p><br/><p>They were once one and now walked separately.</p><br/><p>And with this miracle the Hero\u2019s Egg inside of Hinata was passed down to the Chloe of the future.</p><br/><p>Thus was the true birth of the Hero Chloe O\u2019Bell.

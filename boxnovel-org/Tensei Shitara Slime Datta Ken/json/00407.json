So she should be the next emperor. That was supposed to be the right answer.</p><br/><p>I had only said it because of those reasons. Their reaction was so overdone.</p><br/><p>It made me frantic. Maybe I had been wrong.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps they wanted Michelle's older brother, Alvin, to become the new emperor?</p><br/><p>If that was the case, then it was really up to them to talk about it and work it out.</p><br/><p>In the first place, giving my opinion on the matter would be interfering with their government.</p><br/><p>They were saying something about me entrusting the sovereign right, but I didn't have the authority to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>\"Very well, then. I swear to protect and guide this world you have beautifully restored with all of my body and soul!\"</p><br/><p>Michelle said as she kneeled.</p><br/><p>It really was so overblown.</p><br/><p>Besides, it was Veldora who did the restoring. And Ramiris gave it the power to maintain its state.</p><br/><p>Well, I did lend her the power. But it was those two that had put it into action.</p><br/><p>I was pretty sure that Veldora and Ramiris would hate me for stealing the credit.</p><br/><p>\"Hmm\u2026 Good luck? Right, so you don't mind if I take this guy with me?\"</p><br/><p>In any case, I had succeeded in leaving things pretty vague.</p><br/><p>On top of that, I had acquired some valuable personnel. And while there seemed to be more than a few misconceptions, I was alright with it.</p><br/><p>All's well that ends well!</p><br/><p>As it was too much trouble, I decided that there was no need to clear up any misunderstandings.</p><br/><p>After that, we were guided into the city, where we talked about the finer points.</p><br/><p>I even promised to make schools once things had settled down and send students to help train them.</p><br/><p>Michelle agree with this idea wholeheartedly and gave her consent.</p><br/><p>As they wanted a way to contact us, I gave them a communication crystal.</p><br/><p>Now it would be possible to contact each other if something happened.</p><br/><p>Once the schools were finished and they were ready to receive us, they would send word.</p><br/><p>And just like that, my first negotiation with another world came to a peaceful conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>-As an aside, Almsbine was still alive.</p><br/><p>After returning to Tempest, Fudora took out the 'brain' that had been frozen, and said he wanted to research a treatment method.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>In order to save Almsbine, who was afflicted by a fatal disease, Fudora had gone to the extent of saving him in a state of suspended animation.</p><br/><p>My restorative medicine healed him completely.</p><br/><p>We'll just say that Master Ciel was also really good in regards to medicine as well.</p><br/><p>Normally, she wouldn't have helped them, but if it gave her an opportunity to learn more about the Mobius System, that was a different story-she didn't exactly say it in so many words, but it was pretty obvious that that was what she was thinking.</p><br/><p>It would be better if I didn't interfere with this matter.</p><br/><p>Veldora was very satisfied after being able to run wild.</p><br/><p>Ramiris was the same. On top of that, we had a brilliant new assistant.</p><br/><p>Beretta seemed to have suffered much as well, but he had acquired a new power that more than made up for it. Besides, the Mobius System would be installed in him once it was complete.</p><br/><p>In the end, the visit to the other world was a fond memory for all three of them.</p><br/><p>As for me, I was able to get some operating data from the Different Gate.</p><br/><p>And with a friend from a new civilization, the possibilities seemed to have increased.</p><br/><p>If you looked at the results alone, it was a great success.</p><br/><p>However, you could never be too careful.</p><br/><p>And so this definitely did not mean that Veldora and the others were now allowed to do as they pleased.</p><br/><p>Troubling others and being troubled by them.</p><br/><p>Like that, our lives continued\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>A day that future generations would call the 'Day of Regeneration'\u2026</p><br/><p>Zaza saw it.</p><br/><p>That overwhelming presence.</p><br/><p>A being that was like a god from legend and myth.</p><br/><p>The dragon.</p><br/><p>(Really\u2026could he really\u2014have been the storm dragon\u2026?)</p><br/><p>His body shook with shock, fear and wonder.</p><br/><p>The dragon only needed to roar once, and the thick clouds were blown away and the sunlight rained down on them.</p><br/><p>The dragon only flapped its wings, and a tornado erupted and called forth thunderclouds.</p><br/><p>The embodiment of the supernatural. A being worthy of that monicker.</p><br/><p>Zaza was filled with joy as he looked up at the blue sky.</p><br/><p>\"Great dragon\u2026 I was so insolent\u2026</p><br/><p>Zaza remembered his attitude up until now as he muttered the words in shame.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>And then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014Kaaaaa-hahaha! You're as stiff as ever!\u2014</p><br/><p>The voice of Veldora, that carefree man that he couldn't bring yourself to hate, now echoed in Zaza's ears.</p><br/><p>\"I see. Yes. It's not like me\u2026 Until the very end, you are always ahead of me. Damn it.\"</p><br/><p>Zaza muttered happily.</p><br/><p>Zaza could see the children running towards him.</p><br/><p>Karman was there, on the other side.</p><br/><p>And there was Sharma, Rindo and the other resistance members as well.</p><br/><p>On such a beautiful new days as this, it would be an act against God to continue fighting.</p><br/><p>That is what Zaza thought.</p><br/><p>\u2014And so it was on this day, that the Empire and the Resistance made an eternal peace treaty.</p><br/><p>It was a historic moment, but it was easily overshadowed amidst the miracle that was the rebirth of the planet.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Michelle had no words as her eyes were glued to the person.</p><br/><p>The jiggly, mysterious lifeform had turned into the embodiment of beauty.</p><br/><p>And then, the great words were formed.</p><br/><p>The world was saved, and as the person who was left to unite it\u2014Michelle made a promise.</p><br/><p>-I will lead humanity so that it never pollutes this world again-</p><br/><p>And this duty would be passed onto future generations of emperors.</p><br/><p>And eventually\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The legend states:</p><br/><p>The embodiment of beauty took the dragon and maiden with him and ascended.</p><br/><p>The empire boasted prosperity after that, as if to prove the validity of the divine right of the Emperor.</p><br/><p>And so future emperors declared that they had been chosen by God to lead the world.</p><br/><p>However\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014If God were to determine that the emperor's actions were not justified, the prosperity of this world would once again vanish, as it if it were nothing but a dream\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Such words were inscribed.</p><br/><p>And so the imperial family respected God and dedicated their bodies and souls in order to fulfill their role, which was the governing of the world.</p><br/><p>This sovereignty given by God\u2014after the Day of Regeneration, it became an unending tradition, and was the duty of the imperial family.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014And that was how the legend was born.</p><br/><p>Of course, none of that had anything to do with Rimuru anymore.</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

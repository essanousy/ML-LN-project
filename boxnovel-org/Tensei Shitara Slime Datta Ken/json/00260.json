But what about the punishment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust do whatever you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa? In what sense are you implying\u2026\u2026\u2026 don\u2019t tell me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. Don\u2019t you think such an idiot being in the academy itself is unforgivable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do think that, yes! I very much think that!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laplace looked extremely happy.</p><br/><p>It seems like Tia didn\u2019t quite understand but she understood after my next line.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne year. I will leave them to you for a year, Laplace-chan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much! I feel pumped up already. Also, about the letter of marque, is it really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind not giving it to you if you doubt it, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am extremely sorry! I believe Rimuru-sama from the bottom of my heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laplace looked so happy that it felt like he would go jumping saying \u2018yahoo!\u2019 any moment now.</p><br/><p>It seems Tia also caught up as she gave a complacent smile.</p><br/><p>I guess that is how it is for them, huh\u2026?</p><br/><p>After all, I just officially admitted that they can take low level students as their subordinate.</p><br/><p>These two are special agents under Souei\u2019s control so they generally don\u2019t really get along well with others.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s exactly why, even if it\u2019s only one year, they are so happy to get allies.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also the letter of marque on top of that.</p><br/><p>If some country tries to experiment aviation, he plans to instantly go and crush it.</p><br/><p>If he has subordinates when doing that, that would be the best stage for Laplace.</p><br/><p>Even for Tia, a subordinate worth grueling training would be a good toy to her and that also reflected on her smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, if a youngster with a future was to get involved in an illegal act-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid! I\u2019m the one giving you permission, so it\u2019s legal, alright?! Listen closely, I am the Great Demon Lord. Although I acknowledge the countries ruling their territories in the land, I do not permit it in the sky. As such, it is only natural for the person who announces his right of exclusive possession first becomes the owner, right? Well, I did need Milim\u2019s consent as well but\u2026\u2026 look at this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I brought out a high cla.s.s paper with \u2018intracerebral imagination\u2019.</p><br/><p>The paper has been hardened through magic and it does not degrade. It\u2019s the best paper out there which doesn\u2019t have creases, even after being fold.</p><br/><p>However, what\u2019s important isn\u2019t the paper but what\u2019s written on it.</p><br/><p>There, under Milim and my joint signature, freedom related to specific objectives in the vast sky were written in clauses.</p><br/><p>Maybe Laplace had thought that it was only a license to freely use the air above the Juura\u2019s great forest, which is under my rule.</p><br/><p>However, the paper I prepared is more of a right to rule the sky permit rather than just a letter of marque.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what in the world?! What\u2026 what kinda thing have you prepared\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was surprised. Or perhaps exasperated.</p><br/><p>Laplace couldn\u2019t even speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means, that means? We will really be, able to freely\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s right, Tikun!\u201d</p><br/><p>She screamed \u2018kyaah!\u2019 and clinged onto Laplace.</p><br/><p>And so, as I also showed them the proof, Laplace and Tia also believed me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means, in other words\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Even if a student were to become your subordinate and work under you, that won\u2019t be a crime. After all, any ship flying through the skies without asking my permission is basically illegal trespa.s.sing. Besides, it would be the students who would be troubled if they talk about it after a year when they are released\u2026\u2026 Moreover, won\u2019t they be able to use that experience they gained over the year and make it their own?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease leave it to me! I will properly educate them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too! So much that every day will be paradise!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems Tia and Laplace both were pa.s.sionately thinking about their future plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, since you two properly understand now, let\u2019s get back to the topic at hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I switched gears.</p><br/><p>And like that, in the period of not even a second, we discussed many different things.</p><br/><p>And we came to a conclusion.</p><br/><p>As soon as the \u2018thought transmission\u2019 was released, this time, Laplace didn\u2019t know any hesitation and started to explain again.</p><br/><p>And then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, everyone, do you understand? It\u2019s 30 points~! Incompetent fools who can\u2019t even cross 30 points are not needed in my team~! But, but, I need to use my resources effectively so I will have you work on a secret base over here. You\u2019re free to choose~. And so, please do your best and not die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, attention! This is important so listen closely! We don\u2019t need garbage who pull back others! Our leader is kind so I think he will take really, really good care of his subordinates. But, you know, selfish people won\u2019t be able to become his subordinate. If you want to stay and live here, I won\u2019t stop you but during this one week, don\u2019t you dare betray your allies, alright~!? Keep in mind that all your moves are being seen through that parasite bracelet so act such that you can be proud! Well then, have a fun week~!!\u201d</p><br/><p>And like that, the two brought it to a finish.</p><br/><p>And just like that, they left the disordered students in the island.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

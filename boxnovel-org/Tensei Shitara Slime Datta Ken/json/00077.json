Have you heard this story? During a funeral, the pallbearers accidentally bump into a wall and hear a faint moan. They open the casket and find out that the woman is actually alive.

Ramiris\u2019 Report</p><br/><p>Suddenly barged in exclaiming something\u2026</p><br/><p>W-what did you say!!! \u2026 should have I respond thus?</p><br/><p>Ramiris is running pointing at me.</p><br/><p>Behind her, Beretta is politely closing the door.</p><br/><p>I somehow felt the need to praise his efforts.</p><br/><p>And running at me, I felt that Ramiris was brandishing something.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a being, Diablo, dressed in fine clothes blocked her way.</p><br/><p>He had been quietly observing the conference from the end of the table until now, but he could not have permitted the intruder to act as they pleased.</p><br/><p>How should I say this? Ramiris was quickly restrained.</p><br/><p>While struggling to get free,</p><br/><p>\u300cW-wait! What are you doing!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>She said.</p><br/><p>What a pleasant person. Though I don\u2019t feel a shred of a demon lord\u2019s dignity from her, she is nonetheless a pleasant person.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, I have restrained a suspicious individual. How should I proceed?</p><br/><p>She was screaming some foolishness regarding the city\u2019s demise. Should I dispose of her?\u300d</p><br/><p>Diablo came up to me and politely asked.</p><br/><p>\u300cGeeeeh! I can\u2019t run away even using all my power?!</p><br/><p>T-this guy! He\u2019s no small fry, is he?</p><br/><p>What, I ask: what is going on! What did I do?!\u300d</p><br/><p>As always, she\u2019s damn noisy.</p><br/><p>Frankly, for her to run away from Diablo, who has twice as much magic power as she, is nigh on impossible.</p><br/><p>So this is a demon lord, huh?</p><br/><p>Somehow, the reason I think demon lords are small fry may be completely her fault.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, are you this fairy\u2019s acquaintance?\u300d</p><br/><p>Fuze asked.</p><br/><p>Aaah, the conference came to a halt again. Couldn\u2019t she have barged in a bit later?</p><br/><p>Her inability to read the mood hasn\u2019t changed in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, the fairy Ramiris is indeed my acquaintance.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s also one of the demon lords kind, sort of\u2026? Or at least claims to be\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey! What do you mean \u201cclaims to be\u201d!</p><br/><p>I am feared as the strongest among the ten great demon lords!</p><br/><p>The great Ramiris of the Labyrinth is none other than me!\u300d</p><br/><p>She proudly exclaimed from within Diablo\u2019s restraints.</p><br/><p>It seems that she is completely oblivious to her completely lack of a presence.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? A demon lord\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHeeh, this thing?\u300d</p><br/><p>The gathered replied, completely in line with my predictions.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?</p><br/><p>\u2026Ehhhh?</p><br/><p>What? Shouldn\u2019t you be more surprised?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a demon lord, you know! What\u2019s with that bored glance?\u300d</p><br/><p>No no.</p><br/><p>Even if you claim to be one, you have been captured.</p><br/><p>Maybe they are all just relaxed as a result?</p><br/><p>Is what I thought, but</p><br/><p>\u300cNah\u2026 I mean, Rimuru-dono is a demon lord as well so I expected him to have a few demon lord acquaintances\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAt this point, after being scared half to death by Veldora\u2019s rebirth, these mundane declarations can hardly surprise me\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>They are looking at each other and nodding.</p><br/><p>I see, now that I think about it, that makes sense.</p><br/><p>In contrast to them,</p><br/><p>\u300cHaaah? Veldora\u2019s rebirth?</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you all loony!</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s a small fry that I could have handled with a single punch!</p><br/><p>Hardly a guy to discuss. Well, his era is now over, you see.</p><br/><p>If you must fear somebody, fear me instead!\u300d</p><br/><p>She said while laughing loudly.</p><br/><p>If anything, talking would be her strong point.</p><br/><p>So I had her released and brought to Veldora\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry Veldora, but could you fight her for a bit?</p><br/><p>She is a demon lord, so she won\u2019t die from your aura\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Sorry, I\u2019m currently busy solving a great mystery\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, the culprit is Yasu. Solved, right?</p><br/><p>So I leave her with you\u300d</p><br/><p>I left these parting words and returned to my seat.</p><br/><p>Veldora opened his eyes wide, making a shocked face that screamed\u300eEh? Why did you have to spoil who the culprit is!\u300f.</p><br/><p>As for Ramiris, upon seeing Veldora, she immediately fainted\u2026 and silence returned to the room.</p><br/><p>Having shut both of the trouble children up, we decided to conclude the conference there.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, we decided to release the King and have Marquis Myula and Count Herman seek liability.</p><br/><p>And we\u2019ll have Youmu jump on the opportunity.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf Kingdom, as a result of our recent victory, has declared the intent to form diplomatic relations with us.</p><br/><p>Sorcerer\u2019s Dynasty Sarion has also decided to openly recognize Tempest as a sovereign state.</p><br/><p>And, once we build a highway leading to it, they will also pursue diplomacy with us.</p><br/><p>These two countries are not influenced by the Western Saint\u2019s Church, so they can openly do so.</p><br/><p>Thus, Brumund Kingdom is the only remaining problem.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019d be great if we could say farewell to the church.</p><br/><p>But I doubt the Council will silently accept this\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s what causing the most pain.</p><br/><p>But, no matter which they choose, they\u2019ll get caught up in a conflict.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll somehow persuade the top brass. When I do, we\u2019ll also seek diplomatic relations with you.</p><br/><p>You would accept it, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>He stressed the point.</p><br/><p>Of course we would, though.</p><br/><p>Even from the perspective of profit-and-loss alone, Tempest a country recognized by two of the strongest nations\u2013Military State Dwargon and Sorcerer\u2019s Dynasty Sarion.</p><br/><p>So surely they would be overjoyed at the chance of establishing diplomacy with us.</p><br/><p>But, if compared to sticking with all the Council member states, it\u2019s unclear which way the scales will tip.</p><br/><p>I know the answer.</p><br/><p>At the moment, sticking with the Council will be more profitable.</p><br/><p>However, within ten year, we shall be at least their equal; and, after twenty, we shall leave them in the dust.</p><br/><p>Such is the definitive prediction made by Raphael by analyzing the available data.</p><br/><p>But I will not tell them this</p><br/><p>They must choose for themselves, you see.</p><br/><p>Thus, our current problem is the Western Saint\u2019s Church.</p><br/><p>We predict an inevitable clash with not only the Western Saint\u2019s Church but also the Holy Kingdom Ruberium.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s a big problem.</p><br/><p>I mean, we need to win and display our usefulness and cooperation.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s not like these problems will be easily resolved.</p><br/><p>Right now, everything depends on our actions.</p><br/><p>Thus ended the conference of various states with various expectations.</p><br/><p>This sudden meeting shall go down in history as an important turning point.</p><br/><p>Of course, we could not have known that at the time.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>In the middle of tidying up after the conference,</p><br/><p>I got the feeling that I was forgetting something\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, you! What is this, what the hell is this all about!\u300d</p><br/><p>Something noisy came.</p><br/><p>I remembered. She had come over.</p><br/><p>Her face full of tears, clearly seeking respite.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>She fainted from seeing Veldora, and upon awakening was guided into the world of manga; so, without even noticing that the conference had come to an end, she\u2019s been hitting it off with Veldora the whole time.</p><br/><p>Noticing that everybody was moving around, she remembered her original objective in a panic.</p><br/><p>She is a very carefree individual, so I don\u2019t expect anything important to come from her lips anyways.</p><br/><p>But, upon hearing her words, the foreigner guests stopped their departure preparations.</p><br/><p>And remembering the existence known as Ramiris, they again returned to their seats.</p><br/><p>Pleased with the sight, she arched her back emphasizing her pitiful chest.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll say it again! The Tempest Country shall fall!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>She declared.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-what did you say!!!?\u300d (Read in monotone)</p><br/><p>I ask as a kind of aizuchi.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufun\uff01Well, it\u2019s not like I wish for such an outcome.</p><br/><p>So, be grateful that I have come all the way to deliver this report!\u300d</p><br/><p>Her words have become very condescending.</p><br/><p>Playing along will only prolong this, so let\u2019s get to the point.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, why will we fall?\u300d</p><br/><p>She turned serious upon hearing these words and looked over the gathered officials once.</p><br/><p>And after a little thought,</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it\u2019s not like this doesn\u2019t concern humans, so okay. Listen up.</p><br/><p>By Demon Lord Clayman\u2019s proposal, the demon lords shall hold the Walpurgis Banquet.</p><br/><p>Supporting him are Demon Lords Frey and Milim.</p><br/><p>As it was proposed by three demon lords, it has been accepted.</p><br/><p>An invitation has reached me as well.</p><br/><p>The discussion at the banquet is\u300eAvenging the murder of Demon Lord Karion\u300f</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>The culprit has been named as\u300eThe presumptuous idiot who called themselves a demon lord\u2013Rimuru\u300f</p><br/><p>Did you\u2026 by any chance call yourself one?\u300d</p><br/><p>She asked with a serious face completely benefiting the aloof Ramiris.</p><br/><p>The gathered trembled at her words. Seems like it was a serious matter after all.</p><br/><p>By the way, who\u2019s demon lord Karion? I don\u2019t remember fighting him, though?</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is true that I have called myself a Demon Lord, but I don\u2019t know anything about Demon Lord Karion\u2019s murder\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a minute!!! Is it true that Karion-sama has been murdered?!\u300d</p><br/><p>Interrupting my words, Grucius barged into the conversation.</p><br/><p>Hmm? Could he be Karion\u2019s subordinate?</p><br/><p>\u300cDemon Lord Ramiris, please answer me. Has Karion-sama truly fallen?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-wait a second! Can you please not barge in while people are talking?!</p><br/><p>But, whatever.</p><br/><p>It does seem that Rimuru did not kill him, so there\u2019s some evil ploy unfolding here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tis time for the great detective Ramiris, right?</p><br/><p>At this point, the one who announced it is the most suspicious!</p><br/><p>In other words\u2026 the culprit is Demon Lord Clayman!\u300d</p><br/><p>Completely ignoring Grucius\u2019 words, she jumped straight to the conclusion.</p><br/><p>However, though it pains me to no end, her conclusion is affirmed by Wisdom King Raphael.</p><br/><p>As for her, she\u2019s just reciting the line she read from a manga a second ago.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, I also agree with that hypothesis, but please answer Grucius question.</p><br/><p>Has Demon Lord Karion truly been defeated?\u300d</p><br/><p>The gathered fell silent, awaiting her response.</p><br/><p>For these large countries, it\u2019s a big deal if a demon lord gets defeated.</p><br/><p>It signifies the loss of balance among the demon lords.</p><br/><p>But Ramiris is unconcerned with such matters.</p><br/><p>Without a care,</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the contents of the invitation sent to me?\u300d</p><br/><p>She nonchalantly replied.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s a kid after all. Though I guess it\u2019s good enough that she bothered to come to let us know.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, for what purpose did you let us know this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Oh, the thing is, I was worried thinking what would happen to Beretta if you died?</p><br/><p>So, deciding to become your ally, I came over.</p><br/><p>Which is why I\u2019ll create an entrance to my labyrinth here, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, why are you discussing it all at once! What do you mean an entrance to your labyrinth?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m grateful for the warning, but this is a separate matter!</p><br/><p>And aren\u2019t you treating Beretta like your own thing already?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEeeehhhh\u2026 isn\u2019t it fine? Don\u2019t worry about the small things!</p><br/><p>More importantly, Beretta wanted to say hi. Heeey, come over here!\u300d</p><br/><p>Without listening to others at all, she just says whatever she feels like saying.</p><br/><p>Feels like the conversation came to a close.</p><br/><p>What a ridiculously free-willed individual she is!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Anyways, we decided to disperse.</p><br/><p>Not like we\u2019d get any more information out of Ramiris anyways.</p><br/><p>Promising to let our guests know should any new information arrive, they left satisfied.</p><br/><p>And, the conference being over, we made preparations for their leave.</p><br/><p>Well, for the Dwarf Kingdom, we only had to cut the connection, though.</p><br/><p>As for Fuze, he\u2019ll rest a day here and then return to Brumund.</p><br/><p>Duke Elalude wanted to talk with his daughter more, so he\u2019ll be spending a few days.</p><br/><p>It was truly an impromptu conference, but many important individuals gathered.</p><br/><p>And though we had a selfish fairy barge in on us, I judged the conference a fruitful one.</p><br/><p>Thus our impromptu conference came to a close.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Now then, after switching rooms, I had gathered the Departments.</p><br/><p>Along with Youmu, Myulan, and Grucius.</p><br/><p>Though we are using the small conference room, we were all able to find a seat.</p><br/><p>According to what Fuze has gathered, Walpurgis Banquest is a night where all the demon lords gather.</p><br/><p>Three voices are need to schedule it, a gathering of truly powerful individuals.</p><br/><p>Absentees have to be prepared to face severe consequences, as this is a covenant established between all the selfish demon lords.</p><br/><p>In the first place, these happen really rarely and are hardly mentioned in human literature.</p><br/><p>But still, the name \u201cWalpurgis Banquet\u201d is typically associated with the beginning of a Great Holy Magic War.</p><br/><p>The last one being over a thousand years ago and resulted in myriad casualties and great calamities.</p><br/><p>Thus, it is commonly known as the banquet that brings chaos and destruction into the lands.</p><br/><p>\u300cTheir current target is Rimuru-dana, so you best be prepared.</p><br/><p>Worst case scenario, you will have eight demon lords as enemies.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s if we trust Demon Lord Ramiris\u2019 words, that is\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Fuze said, worrying for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll do something about it\u201d I said to reassure him.</p><br/><p>Being hunted by demon lords, though\u2026 cut me some slack.</p><br/><p>Thus, I decided to hold a counter-measures meeting.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, I understand that it feels like we are continuing the conference indefinitely, but please bear with me.</p><br/><p>We are currently gathered here regarding\u300eDemon Lord\u2019s Walpurgis Banquet\u300f</p><br/><p>According to Ramiris\u2019 report, I am their target.</p><br/><p>What do you think we should do?\u300d</p><br/><p>Anyways, I\u2019ll ask for their opinion first as I always do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Shion excitedly raised her hand.</p><br/><p>When I point at her,</p><br/><p>\u300cHow about we cut down all the demon lords?\u300d</p><br/><p>Calling on an idiot\u2026 my bad.</p><br/><p>I felt a blood vessel pop on my head. Hadn\u2019t something like this happened before\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cShion, how would you cut them down? Do you have a realistic opinion?\u300d</p><br/><p>She hung her head in shame upon hearing my words.</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, it seems strange that Demon Lord Milim had supported the notion.</p><br/><p>Smells suspicious if you ask me\u300d</p><br/><p>Souei pointed out.</p><br/><p>I also thought the same.</p><br/><p>\u300cRight. I can\u2019t imagine Milim-sama betraying Rimuru-sama.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s baseless intuition. But I trust my intuition.\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru said.</p><br/><p>I see, though he has no proof, huh?</p><br/><p>The thing is, I don\u2019t feel that I was betrayed by Milim.</p><br/><p>Wisdom King Raphael too, though he has little data regarding this, mentioned that unless there was some great change, such an outcome is impossible.</p><br/><p>I decided to believe in Milim.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. Well, if it comes down to fight against all the demon lords, let\u2019s just crush them.</p><br/><p>Frankly, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama alone will be enough!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion nodded, happy that someone else agreed with her.</p><br/><p>\u300cExactly! Isn\u2019t it wonderful to be a newcomer.</p><br/><p>He took the words right out of my mouth!\u300d</p><br/><p>The all nodded.</p><br/><p>Why has it come to this?</p><br/><p>By the looks of it, more than half are in complete agreement with Veldora.</p><br/><p>The Let\u2019s be Careful Party is composed of Gabil and Gerudo only?</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s raring to go; bloodlust has filled the room.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the meeting was dominated by the War Party.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a second, relax.</p><br/><p>Anyways. We have all agreed that Milim could not have betrayed me.</p><br/><p>So, something must have happened.</p><br/><p>As Ramiris mentioned earlier, the culprit might just be Clayman.</p><br/><p>So we should think upon what has occurred\u300d</p><br/><p>I was successful at diverting the conversation from its dangerous course.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s get to the main point.</p><br/><p>\u300cRight? Right?</p><br/><p>Great Detective Ramiris\u2019 intuition was spot on!</p><br/><p>In that case, shouldn\u2019t we just blow Clayman away?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. That makes sense.</p><br/><p>Alright, I\u2019ll go and cut that guy down\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, wait, wait! Relax a bit, Shion.</p><br/><p>Stop getting ready to go\u2026 Benimaru and Souei, you too!\u300d</p><br/><p>Seriously.</p><br/><p>This is not going in the direction I wanted it to.</p><br/><p>And Ramiris is getting carried away as well.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, why? Why do you have so many powerful devils lying around here?!</p><br/><p>At this point, isn\u2019t it fine for me to have Beretta!\u300d</p><br/><p>She continued.</p><br/><p>What a troubling person. She just doesn\u2019t give up.</p><br/><p>And, noticing that my comrades are strong, she\u2019s getting carried away herself.</p><br/><p>Her selfishness knows no bound!</p><br/><p>\u300cWould it be fine? I do not believe Karion-sama has fallen.</p><br/><p>But, would you be willing to bring me to this Walpurgis Banquet?\u300d</p><br/><p>Grucius said.</p><br/><p>Hmph. I might.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnly the demon lord and two to three escorts can attend the banquet.</p><br/><p>Individuals not involved in the banquet would be killed, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris responded.</p><br/><p>On that note, I thought up something I wanted to ask,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, can you let them know that I will be participating?\u300d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes focused on me.</p><br/><p>I mean, if I\u2019m being hunted, I might as well go and meet them myself.</p><br/><p>This might also serve as a good test for the new barrier; and, worst comes to worst, I have the confidence to run away.</p><br/><p>So rather than prowling the shadows, doesn\u2019t attacking them head on sound more fun?</p><br/><p>More importantly. I will never again let this city suffer a casualty.</p><br/><p>If you\u2019re planning on attacking my friends, you have got to be prepared for my response.</p><br/><p>Aaah. Seems like I\u2019ve turned into a muscle-for-brains as well.</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahaha! He\u2019s raring to go! Very well, I shall also go!</p><br/><p>With me attending, the Demon Lords shall know bottomless fear!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! If master Vel-chan is going, I too will be safe!</p><br/><p>With Beretta as well, my defenses are perfect!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026No? I\u2019m not planning on protecting you at all though?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUeee?! That\u2019s so\u2026 cold\u2026 master Vel-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd what\u2019s with this \u201cmaster\u201d thing\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know when, but they have become manga buddies.</p><br/><p>Being friends is good and all, but that feeling doesn\u2019t seem to be reciprocated.</p><br/><p>Thus, via a dedicated demon lord channel, Ramiris let them know that I will be participating in the banquet.</p><br/><p>What a pointlessly high level skill\u2013it allows communication via space manipulation.</p><br/><p>While she is busy with that, Beretta came up to greet me.</p><br/><p>\u300cI congratulate you on becoming a demon lord.</p><br/><p>I too have received a blessing thanks to your evolution, and wish to say thanks.</p><br/><p>As a result, I have evolved from an Arc Doll into a Chaos Doll.\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, deeply bowing.</p><br/><p>He acquired unique skill\u300eSaint Demon Union\u300f</p><br/><p>As a result, he nullifies essentially all physical or magical attacks, and, by combining demonic and saint powers, he evolved into a Chaos doll.</p><br/><p>So, for example, while the arc doll could not have moved in the Holy Barrier I was trapped in, he now evolved beyond it.</p><br/><p>New spirit cores awakened within his body, and by mixing with the magic ones, they became Saint Demon ones.</p><br/><p>I really want to study him, but it\u2019s not the time for that now.</p><br/><p>\u300cO-oh. As long as you\u2019re healthy.</p><br/><p>Once this incident ends, let\u2019s talk a bit?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! Your words are wasted on someone like me. I am looking forward to such a time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. I\u2019m also happy that you\u2019re listening to what Ramiris is saying.</p><br/><p>Well, as long as you ignore any unreasonable orders.</p><br/><p>If anything happens during the Walpurgis Banquet, I\u2019m counting on you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLeave it to me. I will live up to your expectations!\u300d</p><br/><p>After such an exchange, Beretta sat down.</p><br/><p>Since Ramiris had only one subordinate, Grucius came along with her.</p><br/><p>Myulan also wanted to settle her grudge, but Youmu stopped her.</p><br/><p>Well, her battle power is a little lacking.</p><br/><p>So Beretta and Grucius will attend along with Ramiris.</p><br/><p>While I was talking with Beretta, Shion was looking at me with a pained expression.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s bound to rampage if I don\u2019t bring her.</p><br/><p>So, I decided on Shion as one of my escorts.</p><br/><p>And, calling Ranga from within my shadow\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI hope you would choose me. I will not lose to the likes of some demon lords!\u300d</p><br/><p>How reliable.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s decided.</p><br/><p>Benimaru and Souei are disappointed, but they\u2019ll just have to get over it.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also the job of ensuring this city\u2019s defense.</p><br/><p>Along with Gabil and Gerudo, we have a solid defense system.</p><br/><p>On a one in a million chance the Church sends a subjugation team, I had Diablo observe the region.</p><br/><p>Destroying Templar\u2019s in order to bring down the Holy Barrier takes priority, after all.</p><br/><p>So maybe I should leave Souei on guard duty as well.</p><br/><p>While waiting for Ramiris\u2019 response, we are busy doing menial tasks.</p><br/><p>In the end, my participation was recognized.</p><br/><p>The demon lords may have just thought it inconvenient to have to go all the way out here to attack.</p><br/><p>But, this presents a wonderful opportunity.</p><br/><p>I now have acquired the right to participate in Walpurgis Banquet.</p><br/><p>The demon lords I am fated to meet\u2013Leon Cromwell and Clayman.</p><br/><p>But this time, my target is Clayman.</p><br/><p>I have not forgotten the Orc Lord incident.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also Myulan\u2019s case.</p><br/><p>And more importantly, I worry about Milim.</p><br/><p>Say your prayers.</p><br/><p>You made me your enemy.</p><br/><p>I am not so naive as to forgive my enemies.</p><br/><p>\u2026As long as you\u2019re not a beautiful girl\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

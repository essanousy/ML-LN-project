If things went according to plan, victory will not be too difficult to attain.</p><br/><p>Of course, I myself wasn\u2019t going to fight. So I would just be cheering them on.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, will we be able to win?\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered these anxious questions without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes.</p><br/><p>Will we be able to win? Are they still thinking in such weak terms?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not about questioning yourself. We\u2019ll win! That\u2019s the kind of intensity you needed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We will win!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Julius is right. Do what you have to do and don\u2019t think about anything else. If everyone fulfils their roles, we will surely be victorious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, Julius and Karma. You guys do say such good things sometimes.</p><br/><p>Yes, that was exactly right.</p><br/><p>Just give it a try. If it doesn\u2019t work, then we\u2019ll think about it when the time comes.</p><br/><p>We won\u2019t have a chance of winning if we\u2019ve given up before even starting.</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly! It seems like Julius and Karma really understand it. Well, just give it your all. I and the other teachers will be watching!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps those words encouraged them, because all of the hesitation and worry seemed to disappear from the students.</p><br/><p>They would be fine if they could continue like that.</p><br/><p>Still, Julius and Karma were two people that thought very differently, and yet they had come a lot closer than I would have expected.</p><br/><p>One of them was a noble. And a royal heir.</p><br/><p>The other was the son of a soldier. A beastkin, who are connected with monsters.</p><br/><p>They stood in very different positions, but they helped each other unpretentiously.</p><br/><p>This fact alone showed that this survival training had worked.</p><br/><p>Create a dangerous situation and expose the true nature of people.</p><br/><p>It was a drastic form of treatment, but it had succeeded this time.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

Once you add circumstances such as parents and the countries policy, things become even worse.</p><br/><p>We should eliminate inequality as much as is possible. Adults should help children and be as fair and accurate as possible when evaluating the students.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t about giving everyone first-prize in order to be equal. Every student should be looked at individually and treated correctly based on that.</p><br/><p>And so, in this special school environment, I had decided that the symbol of adulthood that is the states expectations, should have no reach here\u2026</p><br/><p>And yet these \u2018Humanity Emancipation Alliance\u2019 people have challenged this right to my face. They must really want to die.</p><br/><p>Even I had to make compromises instead of pushing my beliefs onto others. How could they be so selfish?</p><br/><p>To bring in their differences in class into a space that is supposed to be fair\u2026 It was a violation that could never be forgiven.</p><br/><p>I would have to think about how we would handle this in the future, as well as a punishment for Magnus. At the very least, something will have to be done to make them stop influencing the school.</p><br/><p>I had hoped that the graduates of the school would become teachers to take charge of the next generation, but that made this early part all the more important.</p><br/><p>This was something that required serious thought.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>In any case. Magnus had to be dealt with now.</p><br/><p>I looked at Julius, Karma and the other students and smiled. Just then, the magic circle that Magnus and the others had set up began to glow.</p><br/><p>It seemed that they had come, just like they said they would.</p><br/><p>And since they came all the way here, they deserved the warmest welcome.</p><br/><p>Now, how would it go down?</p><br/><p>Well, I guess I would relax and watch this fight with the students until the end.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Julius and Karma stood in the front as they greeted Magnus and the others.</p><br/><p>Magnus saw them and his eyes bulged.</p><br/><p>The people he had thought that he\u2019d killed were alive, so it was no wonder he was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

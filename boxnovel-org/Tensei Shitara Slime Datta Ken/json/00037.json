I was sure that I did\u2026</p><br/><p>Landlord: Well you didn\u2019t. Miss the payment again, and it\u2019s eviction time. It\u2019s about time you stopped fooling around. Go find a proper job!</p><br/><p>Clown: The circus is the only place for me! I tried working at a day care, but the kids were always crying. I tried working at a hospital, but they fired me after I made some balloon animals. I tried working in a post office, but they told me to wipe the smirk off my face. And McD*nalds employs my uncle. Can you imagine how hard it is for that clown to appear in every place at once? There\u2019s a limit to our magic!</p><br/><p>Landlord: \u2026 have you tried counseling?</p><br/><p>Clown: The job?</p><br/><p>Landlord: The help.</p><br/><p>Clown: Isn\u2019t it a bit unnerving that doctors call what they do \u201cpractice\u201d?</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Forest Disturbance Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 37 \u2013 Encounter ~ Benimaru &amp; Ranga</p><br/><p>Gabil continued the hopeless struggle.</p><br/><p>The odds were clearly against them.</p><br/><p>Without ever tiring, without ever resting, the orcs constantly attacked.</p><br/><p>The goblins and the lizardmen, on the other hand, were slowly being killed off on by one.</p><br/><p>They only needed to regain their formation and break through the encirclement, but doing so would mean abandoning the goblins who lack the necessary mobility.</p><br/><p>Moreover, many exhausted and wounded lizardmen would be lost in the charge\u2026</p><br/><p>Though he had refused to order a retreat, perhaps now he had no choice but to try to save even a few lives.</p><br/><p>Normally, the war would end when a decisive blow had been dealt to the enemy. However, the orcs sought the complete eradication of the lizardmen.</p><br/><p>No chance of surrender either. Simply being killed and devoured.</p><br/><p>That fact evoked fear. The weak willed monsters lost their will to fight and abandoned their post. The goblins, in fact, could no longer be considered a force at all.</p><br/><p>Some goblins gave up and tried to escape, but such was not permitted by the orcs. Hunting down the escaping goblins, they killed and ate them.</p><br/><p>No more than a thousand goblins had now remained. Soon they will be completely annihilated\u2026</p><br/><p>The lizardmen fared not much better. The original eight thousand troops were now reduced to less than six thousand.</p><br/><p>They kept losing ground, making organized movements difficult to perform.</p><br/><p>Yet Gabil kept encouraging his troops. While slowly trying to break through the orc encirclement\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a squad of orcs clad in black armor began to move.</p><br/><p>Different from common orcs, these took command of the battle. Each wore full plate armor.</p><br/><p>Perhaps their base strength was no higher than that of an average orc. However, their equipment made all the difference.</p><br/><p>They, in turn, were commanded by a single orc. Carrying an aura of strength around him, he was clearly world above the common orcs.</p><br/><p>The Orc General.</p><br/><p>Possessing the strength of an entire army, the Orc Army General. And following him are 2,500 orc knights.</p><br/><p>There are five such individuals. Their power may be ranked as B+.</p><br/><p>A fourth of the Orc Lord\u2019s true army had moved.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s over.</p><br/><p>That power could decide the battle right there.</p><br/><p>Escape is impossible. Their only choice is to fall in battle\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least, I want to be cut down by a warrior.\u201d So he thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuwahahahaha! Cowardly general of swine! Do you have the courage to meet me alone in battle!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He cried loudly.</p><br/><p>He could not win. His armor was in pieces.</p><br/><p>Moreover, seems like his opponent\u2019s armor was strengthened with magic.</p><br/><p>If he accepts this request, Gabil could die like a warrior. If it went well, perhaps he could take out a single general. Such were his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u300cGugugu. Very well. I\u2019ll be your opponent!\u300d</p><br/><p>Responding thus, the orc general jumps down from his horse.</p><br/><p>The surrounding clashes froze, swallowed by his aura. Further away, fighting continued, but it didn\u2019t reach Gabil\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Gabil could feel his concentration rising like it never had before.</p><br/><p>\u300cI am grateful!\u300d</p><br/><p>The rest was a silent duel.</p><br/><p>Gabil readied the Magic Weapon: Water Vortex Spear.</p><br/><p>\u300cCome!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Orc General bellowed, and at the same time</p><br/><p>\u300cDie!!! Water Vortex Style, Tornado Crush!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gabil released an attack filled with all his might. Combining spear technique and magical energy, a certain kill technique.</p><br/><p>It was filled with all the strength Gabil had. However,</p><br/><p>\u300cKanrangue!!!\u300d(Chaos Eater)</p><br/><p>(TL Note: do you want me to translate skill names? Some of these may get strange\u2026</p><br/><p>Pointing his spear at Gabil, the Orc Lord devoured the vortex itself.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not all; the spear also began emitting an aura. An ominous yellow aura that attacked Gabil\u2019s very flesh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seeks to eat me!\u201d Stumbling, falling Gabil realized. However, the aura would not let him escape\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cGuguguga! Pitiful lizard. Rolling in dirt suits you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gabil was laughed at by the Orc General.</p><br/><p>But he wouldn\u2019t give up. If only\u2026 if only he could land a single hit\u2026</p><br/><p>Picking up some dirt, he flung it at the orc. Call it cowardice, but Gabil desired the chance to cut him down!</p><br/><p>However, that attack, too, was in vain, as the yellow aura quickly devoured it.</p><br/><p>Gabil felt the attack directed at him.</p><br/><p>He was desperate to evade that aura, but knew not how.</p><br/><p>This far, huh\u2026</p><br/><p>Gabil thought, and closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a deafening roar.</p><br/><p>The previously silent scenery came alive again.</p><br/><p>That roar assaulted the orc general, preventing him from landing a finishing blow on Gabil.</p><br/><p>What was that?</p><br/><p>Even amidst the battle, Gabil was confused. By now, the tide began to change.</p><br/><p>Without any concern for Gabil\u2019s thoughts, events developed rapidly before him.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s strike mowed down many orcs.</p><br/><p>That became the signal to start the battle.</p><br/><p>Benimaru was not surprised by the sudden slash that came from behind him.</p><br/><p>Rather, he only muttered</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat the hell she doing\u2026 that idiot\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru did not tremble, for better or worse, and the goblin wolf riders were also stoic.</p><br/><p>Rather, he was merely bitter that he could not draw first blood. However, he finally could go wild. He could bear the earlier grief.</p><br/><p>Advancing at full speed, they crashed into the orc troops.</p><br/><p>The orcs were ready to sudden attacks by unidentified individuals, but they simply could not react in time to the speed at which the wolf riders attacked.</p><br/><p>Brittle.</p><br/><p>That is how Benimaru had described them.</p><br/><p>There was no need even for us to go out, the goblins could have managed this alone.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t fun, so he thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cAll troops stop!\u300d</p><br/><p>He ordered.</p><br/><p>To give up the momentum they had built up would normally be unthinkable. Moreover, for a unit specializing a speed such would be unnecessary\u2026</p><br/><p>But the goblin riders, without a question, immediately stopped.</p><br/><p>\u300cRanga, could you shadow step to the Lizardman named Gabil?\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru asked. Souei\u2019s skill, and Ranga\u2019s as well. Since it\u2019s the same, it should be possible, right? He didn\u2019t know, so inquired.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is possible.\u300d</p><br/><p>A simple response.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright! You go on ahead and protect them. I\u2019ll stroll over there!\u300d</p><br/><p>What a strange thing he had said! To stroll forward in the middle of a battlefield replete with orcs.</p><br/><p>Gabil\u2019s group should have been encircled by many warriors, such that a small number of troops could never break through.</p><br/><p>And rather than advancing quickly, he decides to walk there? What a bizarre thing to say\u2026 one would expect.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood. And please, take your time getting there. I\u2019m off ahead!\u300d</p><br/><p>With those words, Ranga leaps into a shadow.</p><br/><p>Benimaru stands firmly on the ground, and slowly prepares himself.</p><br/><p>Seeing his actions, the orcs were at a loss. Should they attack or not?</p><br/><p>The goblins thought his appearance magnificent.</p><br/><p>Well, among them</p><br/><p>Gobuta: \u300cHmm? Why\u2019d we stop~su? Is running ahead bad~su?</p><br/><p>No way, must we walk ahead~su? I hate walking~su!\u300d</p><br/><p>There was one goblin who had said that, but let\u2019s ignore him.</p><br/><p>\u300cOkaaay. Yo, bastards. Yeah, you pigs over there, move. If you do, I\u2019ll let you go!\u300d</p><br/><p>Finishing his stretches, Benimaru calls out to an orc in front of him.</p><br/><p>But not a single orc moved.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t screw with us! How could you\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, die!\u300d</p><br/><p>Since they had no intention to retreat, Benimaru decided to step in himself.</p><br/><p>On his right palm, a black spherical flame appeared.</p><br/><p>Increasing the diameter of this ball to a meter, he shot it at the orcs.</p><br/><p>Sensing danger, they tried to run away. But it was far too late.</p><br/><p>The ever accelerating round chased them. It\u2019s speed was around 600 kph\u2013clearly beyond the orcs\u2019 abilities.</p><br/><p>Those struck were immediately engulfed and burned without leaving ashes.</p><br/><p>However, the terror of the flame was not in this.</p><br/><p>The ball also absorbed the magical energy of the orcs it struck and used it to fuel its growth.</p><br/><p>Rather than a ball, it was now a dome with a radius of 100 meters.</p><br/><p>And in a second, another roar resounded across the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t actually that loud, but those that heard it could feel their blood freezing in their veins.</p><br/><p>Wide-area destruction skill\u2026 [Hell Flare].</p><br/><p>A skill that Benimaru had acquired. The black dome had disappeared, and left scorched earth behind it.</p><br/><p>They were supposed to be fighting in the marshes, but the ground was burned into glass.</p><br/><p>Who could even imagine that terrible heat!</p><br/><p>It should go without saying, but it is easy to guess what happened to the orcs who got caught in the 2,000 ~ 5,000 degree fireball. Even their ashes were burned.</p><br/><p>Only a minute had passed since Benimaru shot the flare.</p><br/><p>And flashing a wicked smile,</p><br/><p>\u300cClear the way, swine!\u300d</p><br/><p>He declared again.</p><br/><p>The orcs were panicked out of fear.</p><br/><p>Though they were under the effect of the [Starving Ones], they should not have even recognized the emotion called fear.</p><br/><p>However, that one attack awakened that terrible feeling.</p><br/><p>For no matter how much they struggled, they could not escape.</p><br/><p>An overpowering strength that they could not even imagine. Only forbidden spells could match such awesome might.</p><br/><p>They had no way to counter the skill, and even if they attempted to grow stronger by feeding, the corpses were burned to a crisp.</p><br/><p>He was truly a high demon far beyond their reach. And thus they feared.</p><br/><p>The panicking orcs began to disperse.</p><br/><p>Soon, they could barely maintain order.</p><br/><p>Seeing them act like this, Benimaru quietly walked ahead.</p><br/><p>To him, the orcs ahead were naught but a hindrance.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Gabil was ready for death, but, strangely, he didn\u2019t feel the blow other than the one that hit him in the side.</p><br/><p>Feeling that something was amiss, he fearfully opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>What he saw before him was a black wolf.</p><br/><p>One that he had seen before\u2026 Right! The body double of the leader of the fang wolves!</p><br/><p>\u300cO, ooo! Body double-dono, have you come to offer assistance?\u300d</p><br/><p>He asked without thinking.</p><br/><p>What had happened, Gabil did not know, nor did he have the strength to look around.</p><br/><p>Flustered, he finally looked around.</p><br/><p>Somewhere in the distance, some commotion was occurring.</p><br/><p>And to Gabil,</p><br/><p>\u300cI am not a fang wolf, nor a body double.\u300d</p><br/><p>Reverberating from the depth of his stomach, Ranga said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>And having zero interest in Gabil, he stared at the Orc General.</p><br/><p>They stared at each other.</p><br/><p>Orc General himself was confused. Suddenly a monster of great power had appeared.</p><br/><p>He felt power oozing from the beast\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>And moreover, from the direction the beast had come, he could feel terrifying magical energy.</p><br/><p>Some great misfortune happened there. So the Orc General felt.</p><br/><p>But being clueless to this all,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat a revelation! Then, if you are not a fang wolf\u2026 would you be the leader of the black wolves?\u300d</p><br/><p>Gabil asked surprised.</p><br/><p>Surprised that Gabil had not recognized him for who he is. Ranga declared with a sigh,</p><br/><p>\u300cWould you shut up for a minute. I am Ranga! The one who serves Rimuru-sama!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>And to the orc,</p><br/><p>\u300cSwine, if you retreat, I shall not chase; if you attack, I shall not forgive!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ranga barked.</p><br/><p>The orc soldiers trembled, but not of fear.</p><br/><p>Their general by their side, the effect of [Starving Ones] was strengthened.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuguguga! How insolent! A mere beast dares bare his fangs at me!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Orc General retorted.</p><br/><p>And thus a battle began between them.</p><br/><p>The general commanded the orc soldiers to surround Ranga.</p><br/><p>For a beast, he saw no need for a fair fight.</p><br/><p>But Ranga only laughed.</p><br/><p>How joyous he was! He could finally show his true abilities.</p><br/><p>*Uoooooooooooooooooooon!!!*</p><br/><p>Howling with all his strength, Ranga released his aura.</p><br/><p>How long had he lurked within his beloved Rimuru-sama\u2019s shadow, absorbing the aura, while constantly re-imagining his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAim for this form!\u201d Since he was told so, Ranga worked daily.</p><br/><p>And now came the time for Ranga\u2019s true power to awaken.</p><br/><p>Power gushed forth from his body.</p><br/><p>His muscles bulged, his claws hardened, his fangs sharpened.</p><br/><p>And, two horns appeared atop his head\u2026</p><br/><p>That appearance, was just like that of his lord. Thus Ranga evolved into Tempest Storm Wolf.</p><br/><p>Ranga glanced at the Orc General.</p><br/><p>And he knew, he was no threat. To get a feel for his power, and to prove his intuition, he moved.</p><br/><p>Ranga felt the flow of power, and directed magical energy into his horns.</p><br/><p>After observing Ranga\u2019s transformation, Orc General sensed danger.</p><br/><p>Go! He wanted to scream the order\u2026</p><br/><p>Flash, and a roar.</p><br/><p>Many lightning pillars appeared, connecting the heavens and the earth.</p><br/><p>And a winding waterspout.</p><br/><p>It was a skill that Ranga acquired, [Death Storm]. A wider area skill than the [Black Lightning].</p><br/><p>In a second, the Orc General was vaporized, and the surrounding orcs fell to the ongoing storm.</p><br/><p>After the storm had passed, no orcs remained in the vicinity.</p><br/><p>Wide area skill [Death Storm] held truly terrifying power.</p><br/><p>Ranga observed this situation.</p><br/><p>There were no casualties among the lizardmen, and he had used it with the largest possible range.</p><br/><p>As expected, a lot of energy was used to fuel this skill, but Ranga could still continue fighting.</p><br/><p>Having confirmed mastery over this skill,</p><br/><p>*Uooooooooooooooon!!!*</p><br/><p>A roar of victory.</p><br/><p>Looking down at his feet, he saw a fainted Gabil.</p><br/><p>However, that was none of his concern. He was ordered to protect the lizardmen, and having them faint posed no problem.</p><br/><p>Perhaps now that stupid lizard would fix his misconceptions.</p><br/><p>Thinking that, Ranga sat down.</p><br/><p>Far away, he could see Benimaru slowly walking towards them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

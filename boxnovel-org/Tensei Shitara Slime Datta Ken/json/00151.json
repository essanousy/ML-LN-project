It\u2019s that kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>Not only against an outstanding amateur, I will not get defeated by an expert enemy either.</p><br/><p>I am not playing a game with a disadvantage handicap, but rather had an advantage (Absolute Superiority) at my side.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it\u2019s not like war have rules or whatnot.</p><br/><p>Righteousness is with the winner.</p><br/><p>Anyway, there\u2019s no international laws in this world then there\u2019s no problem, as there were no rule to be abided either.</p><br/><p>In the Council of Nations, more or less there is something resembling an international treaty, normally the course of the event would be the head of the warring countries decided the rule during the war and after the war before starting the war.</p><br/><p>But, in the case of one-sided aggressor country, such rules didn\u2019t apply...</p><br/><p>And so in this case, anything goes in this kind of war.</p><br/><p>Frankly, the rule that I had decided was only one.</p><br/><p>Involving the civilian is prohibited!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s only this.</p><br/><p>Of course, a follow up attack after I declared the war had ended, is absolutely prohibited.</p><br/><p>Oh well, I believe there\u2019s no one that will go against my will and didn\u2019t abide this order.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the Empire\u2019s forces which gathered one after another were projected on the several large screens.</p><br/><p>The First Corps commanded by Gobuta and the Third Corps lead by Gabil were deployed as the Vanguard Force. Making use of their high speed movement, this allows the corps to deal with the situation in any location immediately.</p><br/><p>Their numbers are few, but I judged it\u2019s not a problem if they devoted themselves on hit and run tactics.</p><br/><p>But\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWa! Hey\u2026 why\u2019s there a tank here!?\u300d</p><br/><p>A mere soldier like Shinji and co wouldn\u2019t know a lot about military secrets, so the tank\u2019s existence was not known to them.</p><br/><p>As far as I observe them from the sky, there were 4.000 tanks.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it seem to use magic essence as energy and it didn\u2019t seem to be necessary to replenishing its fuel.</p><br/><p>This tank had high versatility and it seemed to have performance that exceeded our former world\u2019s highest performance tank easily if I only compared by their performance.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know whether it moved only with magic essence, and there seems some kind of refueling, but judging from its speed, it was abnormal.</p><br/><p>I assumed bad roads would not be a problem for it even while running with 100 km/h or more.</p><br/><p>I rise from the ground slightly just like floating in the air.</p><br/><p>\u2018Honestly, Magic is incredible!\u2019 So I thought but more than that, I tasted the bitterness if only it also gets developed in here.</p><br/><p>Obviously it incorporated the knowledge of the \u201cOtherworlders\u201d.</p><br/><p>Even I could hit upon that idea but such ideas like a tank wasn\u2019t suited in a world of sword and magic.</p><br/><p>If only my head got more brains, then I could freely order for an idea \u2026.</p><br/><p>No, let\u2019s stop.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no use even if I regret it. It\u2019s an issue for later.</p><br/><p>When this war is over, let\u2019s try developing things in various ways more freely.</p><br/><p>We wasn\u2019t only surprised by the tank.</p><br/><p>An airship flew.</p><br/><p>\u2018Seriously!?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was hard to hold back the screaming.</p><br/><p>If there is that, transportation will become remarkably easy. The supplies problem would be settled if it was used for war.</p><br/><p>Besides, I am optimistic that I can steal the air supremacy one-sidedly, but this might be a tad self-conceited.</p><br/><p>I was thinking of developing it, but it was practically impossible.</p><br/><p>(I did various development but it was realistically impossible to be implemented.)??</p><br/><p>I should really praise the fruits of the development team of that side, honestly.</p><br/><p>Because there will be no invention of such level that can be completed overnight.</p><br/><p>Well, nevertheless I want to capture one ship safely; after thinking for a bit, there is no other way.</p><br/><p>Well, I was surprised because of the empire\u2019s military weapons, but even so my side wins in information warfare.</p><br/><p>Raphael roughly counted the total of the empire\u2019s soldiers; there seem to be approximately 1 million soldiers.</p><br/><p>An outrageous number has come out.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know how far Yuuki had spread his influence , but it will be difficult for him to keep this number under control, right?</p><br/><p>I think this is probably because of the big effect from the bait I spread.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s so, the enemy army may aim for the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>While I thought about the situation, a corps emerges and begins to detour towards a different direction from the direction that the tank corps is advancing to.</p><br/><p>Apparently, that corps seems going to invade the border around the Dwarf Kingdom outskirts.</p><br/><p>The tank pretends to be the main force, while the real main force was deployed on other place, huh.</p><br/><p>Humph!, honestly only such impression comes out.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat should we do? Should Gobuta and his corps that went to the frontline return?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, their number is not enough anyway, let\u2019s entrust the main force that went to another direction to Gerudo.</p><br/><p>I mean one portion of the enemy will enter the labyrinth, it will be easy to crush every one of them\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, how\u2019s the labyrinth?\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru is unusually serious.</p><br/><p>His usual frank speech has fallen silent, he now bared his true nature as the supreme general.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s really reliable.</p><br/><p>\u300cRamiris, could you take in the entire adventurers\u2019 town around the labyrinth into the labyrinth?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI could you know~! No problem at all!\u300d</p><br/><p>I see, then let\u2019s do it like that.</p><br/><p>Having said that, I explained the circumstances to Masayuki, the Commander of the Volunteer Army.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, really? Is that thing even possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then I left the rest to the surprised Masayuki.</p><br/><p>Apparently, the story became like, after persuading the Demon Lord, he made me to definitely promise to protect the town.</p><br/><p>\u2018As expected from the Hero-dono!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Really reliable!\u2019</p><br/><p>Like that, he receives the praise from the town citizens, Masayuki observed the spectacle with a complicated face.</p><br/><p>But, even with this expression,</p><br/><p>\u2018Hero-dono is still not yet satisfied\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hero-dono will protect this town. We can be at peace if we entrust everything to him!\u2019</p><br/><p>Such interpretations are made, there was no one that noticed Masayuki\u2019 suffering.</p><br/><p>Thus, the surface town was moved entirely to the 101st floor of the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>The 100th floor and the 95th floor changed places, it shifts every single floor and so the defense system was perfectly established.</p><br/><p>Or rather, it might be impossible for those troops to go past the 90th floor.</p><br/><p>Because even with supplies, several days are their limit. As they can\u2019t use the inn inside the labyrinth, such thing as breaking through is impossible.</p><br/><p>The remodeled soldiers could go through two weeks without eating and drinking so Shinji and co said, but it\u2019s unthinkable for them to capture the labyrinth in two weeks.</p><br/><p>Oh well, I can\u2019t be careless, I will think about it at the time that side had already come to attack.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also the possibility that they keep going inside the labyrinth, but it might be useless to think about that for now.</p><br/><p>Well, with such feeling I prepared the preparations. ??</p><br/><p>The town around the labyrinth is isolated, and Gerudo\u2019s second corps with 17.000 people was deployed as the frontage of Tempest.</p><br/><p>Inside there were 10.000 volunteer soldiers and a corps of 50.000 monsters were waiting.</p><br/><p>Because the surrounding countries will also received the news that the Empire had moved, they could succeed in organizing their army quickly, but it might probably will be too late.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t able to summon them before the war, but the empire\u2019s movement exceeds my expectation.</p><br/><p>After all, I only asked them to organize and requested to maintain the status quo in a standby state.</p><br/><p>The worst case is we got besieged and waiting for reinforcements, but in that case it\u2019s already a losing battle.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it depends on the situation.</p><br/><p>Well then, the preparations of this side were completed as well, so let\u2019s start the war formally.</p><br/><p>The Jura Great Forest, my territory as a Demon Lord, has already been invaded by the tank force.</p><br/><p>As to not make the enemy realize it that our side foresees everything, I left them alone until the preparation was complete.</p><br/><p>The situation is already a territory invasion but let\u2019s give them warning with a feel like we have just noticed them.</p><br/><p>By the way, I dispatched the newcomer to each corps as an intelligence officer.</p><br/><p>Gobuta, while looking dubiously,</p><br/><p>\u300cA woman who doesn\u2019t have business with the battle is unfit for the first corps you know-ssu!\u300d</p><br/><p>Said so, but that woman true identity is Testarossa.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2026will be killed by me!\u2019 so, she said and Gobuta fell silent.</p><br/><p>I mean, that way seems more interesting.[1]</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s wait expectantly for him to starts\u300cGa, gasp!\u300dor something like that later.</p><br/><p>In contrast to Gobuta, Gabil has matured.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere are many circumstances that I don\u2019t understand, so I\u2019m counting on you!\u300d</p><br/><p>So he said when I introduced him to Ultima.</p><br/><p>Testarossa, Ultima, Carrera.</p><br/><p>To be honest, the one with the cruelest personality among this three Demon Dukes might be Ultima.</p><br/><p>Gobuta might be in danger if I swapped the one sent to his corps.</p><br/><p>On that point, Gabil seemed to have taken a liking to Ultima.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s great, that\u2019s great.</p><br/><p>Although I inform them that while obeying the general\u2019s order, their true identity must never be exposed, but I feared that they would do something without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>While still obeying the order, and yet, perform a retribution at the enemy. Ultima seems to be a person who will do such kind of thing.</p><br/><p>Gabil, it seems you have saved your own life after I had warned you to not get cocky.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the current amusement is only Gobuta.</p><br/><p>Oh well, as for Testarossa which I dispatched as an intelligence officer, they would be obedient in the beginning, while wait and see.</p><br/><p>As long as it\u2019s in the limits of my order.</p><br/><p>So, I get in contact with Gobuta.</p><br/><p>First of all, issuing the warning\u2026 Well, who should I pick?</p><br/><p>Gobuta was lacking in showiness, Gabil was a hidden force for the time being as he was on standby in the air.</p><br/><p>If it comes to this\u2026.</p><br/><p>(Testarossa, I entrusts this to you!)</p><br/><p>(Yes, thank you very much! I will meet your expectations surely!)</p><br/><p>I order Testarossa.</p><br/><p>Oh well, if it\u2019s her, I will not have to worry that she\u2019s going to die even if the empire doesn\u2019t want useless talks and attack her.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a farce, but it\u2019s necessary to be clich\u00e9.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s alright even if I exterminate them all without saying anything, but a Demon Lord needs to do put up a performance.[2]</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>Lieutenant General Gastar who was Calgurio\u2019s confidant lied on his back at his personal use command vehicle placed behind the latest tank corps, listening to the situation of the Great Forest\u2019s surroundings.</p><br/><p>His position as Lieutenant General was appropriate as Gastar\u2019s ability is high.</p><br/><p>He possess ability to control sound and he also posses ability to finely analyze the situation just by hearing various sounds, Unique Skill called\u300eMusician[3]\u300f.</p><br/><p>Also, he can give specific instructions using a special wave and he can give an order only to his allies even during a scuffle.</p><br/><p>In addition, he had the hidden trump card that can cause cytoclasis using sound wave cannon and he was an influential person who held a high ranking position within the Empire.</p><br/><p>That Lieutenant General Gastar notices that the surrounding sounds suddenly ceased and so, gave a halt order to the entire army.</p><br/><p>A short time later after he issued that order, he saw three people walked from the forest\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t an ordinary traveler, and no one would think that this is just a chance encounter.</p><br/><p>A beautiful woman was leading the three, she possess a beauty that can\u2019t be thought to be a human\u2019s[4].</p><br/><p>Her scarlet hairs flowed lovely and made her good looks stand out.</p><br/><p>But, on contrary with that beautiful face, her body was wrapped in a formal military uniform.</p><br/><p>The two people who followed on her rear were similar, a middle-aged handsome man who seemed to be strict and a bit fat man of unknown age wore a military uniform with a same design.</p><br/><p>Gastar understood and had no doubts that these three people were the Demon Lord\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>When the woman stopped her walk, she bowed and had a sweet smile towards their direction.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone, nice to meet you for the first time.</p><br/><p>My name is Testarossa.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a retainer of the great Demon Lord Rimuru, the master of this area.</p><br/><p>Then, the business I have today is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eI will overlook this if you all leave right now. But, I will not pardon it further if you all went in more than this\u300f</p><br/><p>to convey these words of my master\u300d</p><br/><p>So, that woman\u2015\u2015Testarossa seems to be her name\u2015\u2015said, at the same time the man behind her lightly wave his hands.</p><br/><p>A wall of flame appeared at the moment 1m in front of the most forward invading tank.</p><br/><p>The wall of flame vanishes instantly, leaving a burnt mark on the ground that became a straight line.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou all already understands right?</p><br/><p>When you passed this line, your lives will forfeit.</p><br/><p>People who don\u2019t have the resolution mustn\u2019t pass it.</p><br/><p>Well then, have a good day[5]\u300d</p><br/><p>Testarossa turns back from that spot after she leave behind a graceful bow.</p><br/><p>The men behind her like followed her to leave the place.</p><br/><p>They said what they want to say one-sidedly, without even considering this side at all.</p><br/><p>Their conducts instigated Gastar\u2019s anger.</p><br/><p>(Do it!)</p><br/><p>Gastar briefly give an order to the sniper.</p><br/><p>Receiving the order, the soldier who held the sniper rifle take aims on Testarossa.</p><br/><p>And then, silently a soundless type magic bullet was shot\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Testarossa who turned around, deepens her smile and laughs evilly.</p><br/><p>The magic bullet which should pierce her body was, precisely, stopped by Testarossa\u2019s delicate index finger.</p><br/><p>The bullet initial velocity reaches three times of speed of sound and it\u2019s a lump of undetected magic power.</p><br/><p>At the same time of bullet impact that magic power will be released, that bullet which should kill and wounding the target surely was just plucked in the mid flight without any problem and was lightly thrown away.</p><br/><p>Just like dealing with a worthless toy.</p><br/><p>And then, the three walk away without turning around again and leave without saying anything.</p><br/><p>Fear and confusion almost bursting inside Gastar\u2019s mind but he suppressed it with his willpower.</p><br/><p>The ordinary soldier didn\u2019t understand what just happened. Only himself and the sniper that could notice what just happen.</p><br/><p>Inside Gastar\u2019s mind, fear and humiliation were hanging on the scales, and the one which won was the humiliation.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t be confused! The victory is dedicated to His Majesty the Emperor! All troops, charge!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The tank corps started to advancing all at once to the Gastar\u2019s loud voice command.</p><br/><p>They stepped over the warning line easily and the war had begun.</p><br/><p>[1] Rimuru is so mean to Gobuta XD</p><br/><p>[2] As like a stage play, drama, act etc.</p><br/><p>[3]  Enshousha, the one who do musical performance/play musical instrument .</p><br/><p>[4] She so beautiful that he doubt that a human can have that face XD</p><br/><p>[5] Testarossa use \u3088\u3046Gokigen\u2019you which used by girls.

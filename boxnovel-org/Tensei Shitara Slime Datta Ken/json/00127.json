Don\u2019t let down your guard, you damn fool!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s joyful voice rang while the five remaining adventurers nervously huddled together.</p><br/><p>However, it was in vain.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh wind that blows,spin into a Tornado and cut downmy enemies! Tornado Blade!![1]\u300d</p><br/><p>Huddling together was a mistake .</p><br/><p>The Tornado Blade I threw chopped them up as if sneering at the wary adventurers.</p><br/><p>Tornado Blade was a spherical version of the Wind Blade magic. Though it consumes more magic power, it becomes possible to cut through several enemies in a fixed range at the same time. It\u2019s a convenient magic for group battles.</p><br/><p>Milim performed a surprise attack against the first person to scout for traps.It was a quick death. And before my magic arrived, she had quickly moved to our rear.</p><br/><p>Without making a blunder, like hitting Milim, my magic only hit the adventurer that huddling together.</p><br/><p>Before we could be sensed by the enemy group, I activated invisibility magic[2].</p><br/><p>Once our side began attacking, the invisibility magic was canceled, but the enemy\u2019s numbers were already decreased by one or two people. In addition, they had lost their attacker[3] and the healer[4]from the rear support.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s bad, it\u2019s the ScarletRed Meteor[5]! Be careful!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDamn it, Marja and Nadja were killed by magic. Jean isn\u2019t breathing either! \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShit, you guys! How dare you!!\u300d</p><br/><p>They confirmed our identities now that they could see, and the vanguard came at us burning with anger, but......</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahahaha! How na\u00efve!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOooooohoohoohoo! I can\u2019t let you pass!\u300d(You shall not pass! Lol)</p><br/><p>Veldora and Ramiris stopped the vanguard\u2019s charge in high spirits.</p><br/><p>I could perceive the bright red bar above the warriors\u2019 heads decreasing by half when I looked at them with analysis.</p><br/><p>\u300cThose fellows\u2019 HP are below half. You guys can deal with them right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yes, the red bar above the warriors\u2019 heads expressed their HP= Stamina[6].</p><br/><p>I used this display rigorously. It made it easier to understand by making things look like a game.</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019ve gotten used to the display, it became possible to quickly confirm the situation and give out appropriate instructions.</p><br/><p>Currently, it\u2019s a pattern of a certain victory.</p><br/><p>Beginning with a surprise attack, we managed to kill some of the enemy explorers without alerting them to our presence. That way we could take out the rear support members with low HP early via magic. It would be another story if it was a stronger enemy that capable of activate a continuous barrier.</p><br/><p>However, in this case this party\u2019s lineupwas easy to defeat, so our victory was already decided.</p><br/><p>As expected, Veldora and Ramiris made a bloodbath out of the three warriors acting as vanguards.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s was an easy victory.</p><br/><p>Part of our certain victory tactic is for Milim\u2019s surprise attack to kill the scout while I take out the rearguard with magic like earlier.</p><br/><p>Oh well, we have been hunting Adventurers indiscriminately lately, it seemed like the amount of people taking counter measures had increased a little.</p><br/><p>Though it still hadn\u2019t become a situation where they steered clear of us.</p><br/><p>Even if that happened, I\u2019d merely switch to a different strategy.</p><br/><p>We were within the 24th floor of the Labyrinth. Moderately strong people would arrive here; it\u2019s the perfect hunting ground for us.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe did it! Even the likes of them, weren\u2019t a match for us.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUffuffu. That\u2019s right! We are invincible. The strongest!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahahaha! They\u2019re merely small fries, they\u2019re not even a little worthy of us!\u300d</p><br/><p>My companions uttered such cocky words.</p><br/><p>Yes, we were a set party of 4.</p><br/><p>Eh, what were we doing?</p><br/><p>Of course, we were researching how the ways the adventurers fight, we learnt many things.</p><br/><p>I operated a Ghost, a Wizard[7] fluent in magic with a body clad in a bluish-white flaming aura.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve learned several magics since we began, and I\u2019ve became able to clad my body in Fear Aura[8].</p><br/><p>Veldora was a skeleton but his bones somehow turned golden by using a special alloy called OrichalcumGod's Shine Metal Steel[9] that I had manufactured.</p><br/><p>Orichalcum is mix of Demon Steel and Gold, in addition, it\u2019s a special alloy refined by injecting dense magic power.</p><br/><p>Veldora started by saying that a golden skull was good, but then I made a whole skeletal structure golden.</p><br/><p>As long as there was a core, anything seemed fine for making bones, so the conversion was done easily and a golden Skeleton was made.</p><br/><p>The current strength couldn\u2019t be compared to that of the bones from before, it became pointlessly high spec.</p><br/><p>Milim was feared as the Red Meteor.[10]</p><br/><p>Because she moves at an abnormal speed, she leaves a red afterimage that looks like a meteor.</p><br/><p>As an Assassin, with her way of eliminating her presence and leaping at the target after approaching unnoticed from the ceiling, she boasted a high success rate for assassination.</p><br/><p>She threw away all abilities except agility. Her battle style relied on speed and critical, it seems she become a fearsome legend.</p><br/><p>Ramiris was part of the Fighter faction.</p><br/><p>She wields an axe with all her strength as if she mocking the powerlessness of her original body.</p><br/><p>Her combat style was to go all out, making her popular as the Living ArmorMoving Heavy Armor[11] that wields aDeath AxeGrim Reaper's Great Axe[12] insanely.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it was stronger than the original body....... No, it\u2019s nothing.</p><br/><p>Such a thing doesn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Making such an impression, we had become a source of fear known as the DungeonDeath Bringer of the DominatorLabyrinth's Will[13]\u201d.</p><br/><p>Because we were stronger than an unskilled boss, we were the pinnacle of badness.</p><br/><p>It could be called a natural reaction.</p><br/><p>As I mentioned earlier, our main purpose was to research the ways the adventurers fought.</p><br/><p>We weren\u2019t playing at all. That point shouldn\u2019t be misunderstood.</p><br/><p>We make an effort every day and do nothing but research day after day. Such an honest effort may be useful someday.</p><br/><p>And so, we saw a rare adventurer that used a never before seen extra skill, and used an original magic. We gained a splendid amount of knowledge.</p><br/><p>Right now I can analyze extra skills just by seeing them.</p><br/><p>Such an ability was useful since it influenced our avatars.</p><br/><p>With a pseudo soul as a core, the avatars made with magic power completely matched the main body\u2019s soul. It was very convenient.</p><br/><p>The skills that were obtained by the avatar could be used by the main body. If the avatar grew to a certain extent, it seemed possible to use an ability from the main body.</p><br/><p>They seemed to be more linked than I thought.</p><br/><p>I kept researching with such feelings every day. We have proved various things.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll say it once again, we weren\u2019t playing around, so please don\u2019t misunderstand. </p><br/><p>It was difficult to arrive here.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, we were defeated by adventurers in the upper floor.</p><br/><p>Also, an unamusing situation where we were annihilated by the traps from our own labyrinth occurred.</p><br/><p>Angry, it was a good idea to prepare a magic item that would keep the labyrinth\u2019s traps from activating.</p><br/><p>Ramiris was the one who triggered the trap, but the one who was swallowed by it was Veldora.</p><br/><p>I was floating in the air and Milim was clinging to the ceiling. Since she\u2019d never fallen into a pitfall, Ramiris was careless.</p><br/><p>But, Ramiris......</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, falling into your own trap?\u201dI think that everyone wanted to tsukkomi.</p><br/><p>We spent the troubling times having such feelings.</p><br/><p>The adventurer in front of me whom I had just defeated turned into particle of light and disappeared.</p><br/><p>This was a familiar scene.</p><br/><p>Once we got cocky and tried to defeat the boss of the 30th floor. </p><br/><p>The boss was Gozurl whose power was sealed by a magic item.</p><br/><p>As a result, we suffered a crushing defeat.</p><br/><p>With our current abilities, Gozurl was a tall obstacle in our way.</p><br/><p>We who believed ourselves too weak to defeat him, trained ourselves in the 25-29th floors.</p><br/><p>No that\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s not training but learning.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not playing.</p><br/><p>Truly, please don\u2019t get it wrong!</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was an easy victory.\u300d</p><br/><p>The three people nodded to my opinion.</p><br/><p>Well then, let\u2019s keep going at this pace! When I thought that, I received a messagefrom my emergency-communication-duty clone in the office.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>Is what I was thinking when I received a message that \u300eHinata and Demon Lord Ruminas seemed to have talked regarding an alliance\u300f.</p><br/><p>Apparently, it\u2019s not the time for me to study (play).</p><br/><p>Because it couldn\u2019t be helped, I switched on the avatar\u2019s pseudo soul\u2019s Automatic Mode, and we decided to go back to the office. </p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>When we returned to the office, Ruminas and Hinata were waiting.</p><br/><p>With them was a woman I had seen before. The former Demon Lord Frey sat down on a chair.</p><br/><p>She glanced at me when I entering the room, then she looked to Veldora, her glance stopping on the entering Milim.</p><br/><p>And then a sweet smile floated on her face.</p><br/><p>I wonder why? I felt that smile was very ominous. </p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Milim. You were in here?</p><br/><p>By the way, what happened with the homework I gave you?</p><br/><p>The guards fell down and were rolled up in a bamboo mat, but you can give anexplanation about what happened, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Scary.</p><br/><p>Even though I wasn\u2019t involved, for some reason I felt an unbearable sensation.</p><br/><p>Yes, a friend should play after finishing their homework, but in reality the homework was completely untouched. I happened to catch a similar scene to when lies were exposed to the parent, making them mad.......</p><br/><p>It\u2019s such a nostalgic feeling. </p><br/><p>\u300cGee! Fr, Frey!! It\u2019s, it\u2019s not that. There\u2019s a good explanation!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim became flustered as soon as her eyes met Frey\u2019s.</p><br/><p>This is...... So it\u2019s over, Milim.</p><br/><p>Though I said it daringly, the matter had no relation to me, no, to us did it?</p><br/><p>\u300cHaha, Milim. If you have work, you better go back.</p><br/><p>Because you delaying something, you should finish your work quickly!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, like he said. Sorry to get you involved with our long-drawn research.</p><br/><p>Although you should have told us you had work to do.</p><br/><p>But, it seems we should have paid attention to that. Let\u2019s apologize!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTh, that\u2019s right! Like he said. Don\u2019t be reserved, if you had told us about it we wouldn\u2019t have detained you!\u300d</p><br/><p>As expected.</p><br/><p>Veldora and Ramiris who read the situation backed up my words.</p><br/><p>With this we established our ignorance, and furthermore, it stated that we were unrelated.</p><br/><p>Though I saw Milim\u2019seyes watering, I\u2019m sorry there seems to be no way to help you.</p><br/><p>Give up and bind yourself with a rope[14].</p><br/><p>Thus, Milim was caught by Frey. </p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s different. The story, listen to the story, Frey!\u300d</p><br/><p>So Milim screamed to the end, but it failed before Frey\u2019s iron smile. Resistance was futile.</p><br/><p>Sadly Milim was caught and carried away like a cat[15] back to her own country.</p><br/><p>Phew, that was scary.</p><br/><p>I thought I going to be dragged into it, but it seems like I was able to make it through safely somehow. When I thought so,</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way Rimuru-sama, What have you been doing in all this time?\u300d</p><br/><p>Shuna stood at my back without any presence, and threw a sharp question at me.</p><br/><p>I felt sweat which couldn\u2019t flow appear on my forehead.</p><br/><p>No, we\u2019re safe, it\u2019s alright.</p><br/><p>We never played. Yes, research! Because we were researching.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems like we have become a hindrance to you. Let\u2019s perform the magic research in my room.</p><br/><p>Because sorcery is deep, it grants me with wisdom\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora turned his back with a favored bookManga in his hand while saying such a thing.</p><br/><p>Is he going to run away!?</p><br/><p>When I was going to detain him,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe, then, I should accompany you too\u301c\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris betrayed me too and left, running away together with Veldora.</p><br/><p>How cruel!</p><br/><p>However, right now was not the time to be thinking about those cruel friends.</p><br/><p>I think it was a little weak to keep insisting it was a research.</p><br/><p>Hinata and Ruminas stared in my direction with suspicion-filled eyes, it seemed like a poor excuse would destroy me.</p><br/><p>As I let Veldora and Ramiris\u2019s escape go, my brain cells operated at full strength searching for the optimum solution.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no use, a good idea won\u2019t come. Since it came to this, I went with my last resort.</p><br/><p>\uff08Raphael! Help me find a good excuse to safely get through this situation!\uff09</p><br/><p>Yes, the crystallization of my wisdom, SenseiRaphael should be my ally.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.</p><br/><p>\u300aSolution. Explanation is unnecessary\u300b</p><br/><p>What? Explanation is unnecessary!?</p><br/><p>What does that mea.....</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, you were here? I\u2019ve been looking for you, Danna!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Such a nostalgic presence, it was Fuze.</p><br/><p>I see, that\u2019s what it meant!</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Fuze-kun. The matter I asked you about, how did the investigation go?*</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s hear about it inside.\u300d</p><br/><p>It was a godsend.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s seems like I was able to survive because I used Fuze to investigate Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, as expected from Raphael.</p><br/><p>Was the timing of this and Fuze\u2018s arrival already predicted? You don\u2019t say. Still it\u2019s impossible.</p><br/><p>But, there\u2019s no doubt that I was saved. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t carelessly make a weird excuse.</p><br/><p>I enter the room and invited Fuze inside.</p><br/><p>Then I absorbed my communication-duty clone, and sat in a chair.</p><br/><p>I seemed able to deceive her somehow or another.</p><br/><p>\u300cA secret investigation was it? As expected of Rimuru-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>So Shuna nodded with a satisfied smile.</p><br/><p>The crisis had passed.</p><br/><p>However, to not forget this lesson, I swore to stop playing too much. </p><br/><p>Because I felt guilty, I became unnecessarily flustered.</p><br/><p>You should do things within reason.</p><br/><p>I reflected in my mind to be careful from now on.</p><br/><p>[1] (\u30c8\u30eb\u30cd\u30fc\u30c9\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9) Tatsumakizan (toruneido bureido).</p><br/><p>[2] (\u30a4\u30f3\u30d3\u30b8\u30d6\u30eb) fukashika (inbijiburu).</p><br/><p>[3] (\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc) Mahou shoku (atakk\u0101) \u2013 Magic job.</p><br/><p>[4] (\u30d2\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc) Kaifuku shoku (h\u012br\u0101) \u2013 Recovery job.</p><br/><p>[5] \u3044(\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8) Akai Ryuusei (Suk\u0101retto).</p><br/><p>[6] Tairyoku can also mean endurance/physical strength.</p><br/><p>[7] (\u30a6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9)Majutsushi (wiz\u0101do) - Majutshushi = Magic Master.</p><br/><p>[8] \u3044(\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9)Aojiroi Onibi (fui\u0101\u014dra) - Bluish white demon/ghost flame (Fear Aura).</p><br/><p>[9] (\u30aa\u30ea\u30cf\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3)Kamikagayakinkou (Oriharukon).</p><br/><p>[10] Milim is a three times faster than a regular slime!

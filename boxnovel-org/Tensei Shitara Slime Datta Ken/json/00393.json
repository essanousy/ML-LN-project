However, he was in denial.</p><br/><p>After all, Kristoph was supposed to be the greatest work of the genius Almsbine.</p><br/><p>And so he continued to judge things by what he knew.</p><br/><p>And he challenged Veldora once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! Don\u2019t you dare think that you\u2019ve beaten me with that level of skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kristoph shouted. He was risking everything based on his reputation.</p><br/><p>However, it would not pay off.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon PUUUUUUUUNCH!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora allowed much of the force to weaken as his fist slammed into Kristoph.</p><br/><p>And yet, in front of such a fist, Kristoph\u2019s Ether Ring Barrier was meaningless.</p><br/><p>It broke in an instant. And the impact caused Kristoph\u2019s body to go numb.</p><br/><p>His rising energy had no place to go and began to disperse into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026it can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kristoph could not admit defeat. He meant to fight as a warrior until the end.</p><br/><p>However, his timing was bad.</p><br/><p>Veldora had already lost all interest in him.</p><br/><p>After all, Fudora had just opened the door.</p><br/><p>\u2014The door to destruction.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s instincts told him of this.</p><br/><p>He had had a bad feeling the moment that Michelle\u2019s energy began to rise rapidly.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he knew that this was no time to be playing. It was an emergency and Veldora sensed danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. It seems something has happened with Michelle. So I don\u2019t have time to play with you anymore. Maybe next time. I suggest you train a little more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora said with a boisterous laugh. And with that, he and Ramiris left.</p><br/><p>Kristoph remained\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHe-hehehe\u2026 Surely not. They couldn\u2019t really have lost interest\u2026 But he was strong\u2026 Is he human? No, more important, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Confused, troubled, he thought.</p><br/><p>He was so disturbed that he could not stand up.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s attack had freed him from what control Fudora had over his body that had been printed into his instincts.</p><br/><p>But it would take a little while longer for Kristoph to realize this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Veldora reached Michelle in a single jump.</p><br/><p>It was an emergency, and so he did not hold back.</p><br/><p>He used \u2018Teleportation\u2019 without hesitation.</p><br/><p>But he almost regretted what he saw once he arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Master. This looks really bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, Ramiris. There is nothing I can do now. Let\u2019s leave and pretend like we didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, wouldn\u2019t that mean abandoning, Zaza, Sharma, Rindo, the children, Karman and everyone we met in this world? We can save ourselves, but I don\u2019t want to abandon them as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Yes\u2026 However, there really is nothing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven you can\u2019t do anything, Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. After all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, the scene in front of them was very appropriate for signaling the end of the world.</p><br/><p>Alvin was making a desperate attempt to neutralize the energy that flowed out of Michelle. Fudora\u2019s eyes bulged, blood-shot as he attempted to control it.</p><br/><p>Neither of them even noticed that Veldora and Ramiris were there.</p><br/><p>Veldora understood what was happening at a glance.</p><br/><p>His reading had revealed that Michelle had more energy than Beretta, and now it was all being released.</p><br/><p>But what was more dangerous\u2026</p><br/><p>(To think it would be this bad. I hadn\u2019t been able to read the power reactor, but it seems different in principle from the others. This isn\u2019t a sun. Once a sun\u2019s life is exhausted, it becomes a supernova\u2014no, collapsar? The energy that is being discharged is immense, but what is most dangerous, is the speed at which it absorbs the matter surrounding it\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u2014This is bad, Veldora thought.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be impossible to nullify the leaking energy, but it would be hard to stop the power that was absorbing things.</p><br/><p>If he waited until the collapsar was satisfied, it might eventually stabilize. However, that was only if there was a single collapsar.</p><br/><p>But Veldora\u2019s eyes caught two of them, and they were growing larger at an alarming rate.</p><br/><p>One of them was sucking the substances in, while the other unleashed pure energy.</p><br/><p>In other words, it would never be satisfied. It reminded him of Beelzebuth and its insatiable \u2018stomach\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Because it\u2019s like Rimuru\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris found the answer, and Veldora nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will you do? If this continues, everyone will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora could not immediately answer her question.</p><br/><p>Had he seriously wanted to neutralize it, he would be able to buy them quite a lot of time.</p><br/><p>However, any other methods\u2014for instance, isolating it with a barrier\u2026 It would still be difficult to control this much energy.</p><br/><p>Eventually, it would break through, and the world would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>After all, this was on a different level.</p><br/><p>While it was fine now, if left alone, this was bad enough to swallow up the entire universe.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, well\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like it, but I\u2019ll do what I can to stop it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure, Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no choice but to try.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no option that included leaving things as they were.</p><br/><p>Yes, he had talked about running away, but he would have done so by now, had he really meant it.</p><br/><p>Veldora was fond of the people here who lived so desperately.</p><br/><p>The arrogant Zaza and the brazen-faced Karman.</p><br/><p>Serious Rindo and surprisingly tough Sharma.</p><br/><p>The children, who never despaired regardless of the situation.</p><br/><p>Veldora would never abandon such lovable people.</p><br/><p>Perhaps their meeting had only been a coincidence, but there must be some meaning to it.</p><br/><p>Even a chance meeting is due to fate\u2013There was no difference between coincidence and the inevitable to Veldora.</p><br/><p>He would succeed if he was going to do it at all.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s pride would not permit failure.</p><br/><p>And so Veldora decided to use whatever he could.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will stabilize if you can succeed in neutralizing it while I hold it back. Are you listening to me, humans? I don\u2019t really want to, but I will help you this one time. It must be tuned speedily and completely so the size of the Mobius is identical!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

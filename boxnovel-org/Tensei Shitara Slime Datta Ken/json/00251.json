It is a famous but strict academy which requires a high level of talent from the students and evicts anyone who is deemed talentless.</p><br/><p>The reason Mai is affiliated with this academy is because it develops the most cutting edge tech officially. But in reality, the actual cutting edge tech is being developed deep within the labyrinth but only an extremely small number of people know of it.</p><br/><p>Now then, these are the three academies at this point but what most of them generally do is learn the basics from Ingracia kingdom and then transfer to any of the other academies which suit them.</p><br/><p>If you want to train yourself and be of use to the world, you go to Tempest.</p><br/><p>If you want to deepen your knowledge about a particular field, you go to NNU.</p><br/><p>If you want to use human resources and bear the responsibility of making living harmonious for the people, you stay in Ingracia.</p><br/><p>To be honest, there is no age limit when it comes to getting admitted to NNU or Tempest but only the talented people can get in. The reason for this was simple-if they don\u2019t have the required talent, they simply can\u2019t follow the lectures.</p><br/><p>This is why I came up with the exchange student system.</p><br/><p>With this, you can experience each of the academies before deciding about your future.</p><br/><p>The other reason behind the exchange student system is to readmit the students who can\u2019t keep up with the lectures of Tempest or NNU back to Ingracia Academy.</p><br/><p>It is all up to the students, whether they want to get better or stay down.</p><br/><p>If they work hard and actually do get better, they can get admitted to Tempest once again.</p><br/><p>But if they were to stay down, that is as far they go.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s the repeating a grade system in Ingracia\u2019s academy but only up to two times.</p><br/><p>It is because the country bears all the education cost, students who don\u2019t have any will to study are expelled.</p><br/><p>Although there were no superiority between the academies once a student graduates, it is generally acknowledged that the Tempest graduates are well-built in physique and the NNU were the brains.</p><br/><p>And based on that, it was generally accepted by the public that graduating from Ingracia\u2019s academy was easier.</p><br/><p>And because of these reasons, the planes are used pretty much every month by students to move between Ingracia and Tempest.</p><br/><p>Although the conductor thought I am one of those students, it is actually convenient for me that way for the time being.</p><br/><p>And so, I feigned ignorance and continued my observation.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, why do I have to use the same seats as these poor people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are absolutely correct, Julius-sama. However, it is decided by the academy so please overlook it this time-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I understand. But, still. Couldn\u2019t the academy prepare a better ship than this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Julius-sama. This is also proof that the academy is taking us, the n.o.bles, lightly. I must ask my father and restrain the academy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right! At that time, please let me help, as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was gazing from the rear seat, a noisy bunch came in crowding into the general seats section.</p><br/><p>They were wearing cla.s.sy clothes so they probably came from Ingracia\u2019s academy.</p><br/><p>Although the Ingracia kingdom changed its name to Ingracia College Town, it seems like the previous n.o.bles can\u2019t shake off their n.o.ble feeling.</p><br/><p>It is a problem seeing how there are people who still look down on Tempest as a city of demi-humans or monsters and scorn NNU, saying the Empire is uncivilized and what not\u2026</p><br/><p>The tall, smug-looking guy seems to be called Julius. Judging from the fact that he is still a student, he has probably not inherited his family\u2019s leadership yet.</p><br/><p>And the person trying to b.u.t.ter up to him was a well-dressed guard knight. Although uncouth, he seemed like a sincere guy. The guard was probably the n.o.ble kid\u2019s aide who is now acting alongside him as the n.o.ble kid is now a student.</p><br/><p>As he isn\u2019t carrying any weapons because it would stand out here, I am guessing he is a knight from his demeanor. There\u2019s a rule to keep all weapons of the customers in custody.</p><br/><p>Well, there are many loopholes but I can\u2019t be bothered to think about it all. The conductor will handle things if something were to happen but generally, one needs to take care of themselves, after all.</p><br/><p>If one doesn\u2019t bother other pa.s.sengers, those things are overlooked to a certain extent.</p><br/><p>Other than the n.o.ble guy, there were two n.o.ble girls and a butler for each.</p><br/><p>The girls were wearing the girls\u2019 student uniform. However, the butlers were wearing custom made-to-order battle uniforms.</p><br/><p>Although they looked like normal butler uniform, they were made from special fabric for fighting, just like the conductor\u2019s. They are probably ordered to protect their masters, the n.o.ble girls. They were more or less strong-about \u2018C+\u2019 in rank, I would say.</p><br/><p>These kids seem like quite the elite.</p><br/><p>But, what\u2019s with students having butlers?</p><br/><p>It feels a bit too overprotective considering that they set out to learn to be independent. Well, this world can be quite dangerous so I guess the parents would be worried.</p><br/><p>There were mixed reviews about this but the academy decided to tolerate it.</p><br/><p>Well, leaving that aside.</p><br/><p>These students\u2026 did they just say \u2018couldn\u2019t prepare a better ship than this\u2019?!</p><br/><p>And to also insult the academy-these kids are very c.o.c.ky.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not something you should be saying considering that Tempest is a.s.sisting the three academies from its taxes.</p><br/><p>I got a bit irritated and shifted my gaze towards them.</p><br/><p>As I did that, I noticed that the other students were also not taking it well.</p><br/><p>I mean, of course they would not.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the worst pattern-to be complaining even though you\u2019re studying for free.</p><br/><p>Even if these kids were n.o.bles, inside the academy, there is an ironclad rule saying that they were all equal. Although we are tolerating them bringing along guards and butlers, we are definitely not going to allow partiality towards them\u2026</p><br/><p>It looks like their sense of being the chosen people isn\u2019t fading\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, you guys, that\u2019s enough! \u2018Being poor or rich is completely dependent on the family and it does not affect the student\u2019s skill\u2019-that\u2019s the common ideal between all the academies, you know?!\u201d</p><br/><p>A red-haired youngster couldn\u2019t tolerate it anymore and raised his voice. In response to that, the young man called Julius made a scorning expression and said over his shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, to think the likes of you stinking beasts would come directly talking to me. What blasphemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOi?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Reacting to Julius, a few other students stood up.</p><br/><p>They seem to be students of Tempest as they had prominent characteristics like monsters or demi-humans.</p><br/><p>It is only natural for them to be angry but\u2026 hmm, what should I do?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s sad seeing people like these exist even 8 years after completing the academies. These things are not reported to me but it seems like there\u2019s a need to conduct an internal audit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys, what are you doing?! Just sit down already!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when I started pondering on what to do about the situation, a bald man came in and shouted.</p><br/><p>He seems like one of the teachers and couldn\u2019t overlook this commotion.</p><br/><p>I thought the teacher at least wouldn\u2019t discriminate but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJulius-sama, I will punish these students so please spare them. And also, I negotiated with the crew to move you to the high cla.s.s section as there\u2019s a s.p.a.ce empty because someone cancelled. Please move there.\u201d</p><br/><p>And like that, he started being toady to Julius.</p><br/><p>And the moment that teacher came in, the Tempest students looked down as if they had given up.</p><br/><p>Seems like they gave up early thinking that they can\u2019t win against a teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is with that guy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I ended up muttering out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOho, that\u2019s thoughtful of you. However, I can\u2019t really expect much if someone cancelled on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true but it will surely be better than here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha. I guess I will have to show face if Mr. Jujilas says so much. Well then, guys, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, the Julius party left.</p><br/><p>That cancelled room is probably the one I was going to use.</p><br/><p>I guess they are treating it as cancelled since I didn\u2019t show up on time\u2026</p><br/><p>At situations like these, it is completely the pa.s.senger\u2019s responsibility and so they won\u2019t return my 10 gold coins.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I go and drive them out?\u2019-I even ended up thinking something like that.</p><br/><p>But, if I were to do that, things would get troublesome and there\u2019s a chance of my ident.i.ty getting revealed so I won\u2019t, though.</p><br/><p>But, what did he call that guy again? Jujilas? That guy is getting fired.</p><br/><p>The management of the Ingracia Synthesis Academy is not under my jurisdiction but Tempest is supporting them with huge sums of money. With my authority, firing such a teacher will be a peace of cake.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, is this seat empty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone came asking me, while I was enraged at that teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Ahh, it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I shifted towards the side.</p><br/><p>And so he happily sat beside me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey there. You ended up having to see that, didn\u2019t you? I haven\u2019t seen you before so you are entering the academy first time this year, right? The whole academy isn\u2019t like that-just that there\u2019s an old-fashioned fraction like that still remaining. We are also bothered by them. But, people like those are very few so I am sure a lotta fun things are waiting for you! So I want you to not have a weird preconception about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he sat, he started talking to me.</p><br/><p>This guy is wearing an NNU uniform so he\u2019s probably from a different academy than Julius before. But it seems like he knows him.</p><br/><p>He also probably heard me there and this might be his way of following up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Well, are you having fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought about introducing myself but giving my real name would be bad.</p><br/><p>So for now, I plan on leaving things as they are if he doesn\u2019t introduce himself.</p><br/><p>Thinking that, I asked the question.</p><br/><p>I wanted to know his true opinion for research as it might be helpful later.</p><br/><p>After all, it would be easy to have him talk since we are both students.</p><br/><p>But it seems like he didn\u2019t expect such a question since he looked surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cAha, ahahaha! You\u2019re interesting. My name is Magnus. I might not look like it but I am a fourth year student of NNU Magic and Science Investigation Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what he found so interesting but he burst out in laughter.</p><br/><p>Since he introduced himself, it would look weird if I did not.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my name is Satoru. I am heading to Ingracia to take care of something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, Satoru-kun, eh? Or is it Satoru-chan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I would prefer -kun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot~it! So, you are also in the academy-\u201d</p><br/><p>The student who introduced himself as Magnus came talking to me over-familiarly.</p><br/><p>He seems refreshing but it is kinda concerning how overly friendly he is being.</p><br/><p>It is also a bit unpleasant how he casually comes invading my personal s.p.a.ce. I don\u2019t need to worry about being directly touched as I have a \u2018multidimensional barrier\u2019 up unconsciously but\u2026</p><br/><p>How should I explain this\u2026 like, he has this self-important att.i.tude?</p><br/><p>He probably doesn\u2019t have experience of getting rejected as he\u2019s talented.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey you, you\u2019re acting too friendly with Magnus-sama!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had been feeling it too but it seems that that is how it looked to others, as well.</p><br/><p>But, it is upsetting how she says it, making it sound like I am the one being too friendly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, now, Rozari. This is Satoru-chan. He\u2019s a new student enrolling this year. I was just about to ask him where he plans to get in to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t joke around with me, I told you to use -kun, didn\u2019t I?</p><br/><p>Looks like he is quite the confident type who doesn\u2019t really listen to others.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this kid\u2026 despite being less than a student who hasn\u2019t even enrolled yet, isn\u2019t he being too cheeky to a senpai?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female student called Rozari came b.u.t.ting into our conversation, judging me as cheeky.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s fine and all but I don\u2019t see any reason for them to be so self-important by being senpai when I haven\u2019t even enrolled yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheeky\u2026 now listen here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. The only people allowed to talk to me are fourth year students. Either that, or people who are within rank 100 based on results. I am not someone people like you can speak to. If you understand then give up your seat already!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looks like she doesn\u2019t plan on listening to me at all and acted like she was driving out a dog.</p><br/><p>She probably wants the seat next to Magnus.</p><br/><p>She probably likes him or something and I am in the way.</p><br/><p>This is extremely bothersome.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you were to talk about being a senpai and what not, it doesn\u2019t matter to me as I am not even a student yet. Besides, I couldn\u2019t care less if you are a fourth year student or whatever. I don\u2019t plan on giving up this seat so you better get lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>To my reply, Rozari began shaking in anger.</p><br/><p>And then left, saying \u2018you will regret this\u2019 and giving me a scornful glance.</p><br/><p>The general age at which students get enrolled to the academies is around 15, when the body is complete. It is normal to increase one\u2019s fundamental academic skills at a near educational inst.i.tute until then.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s an admission exam, so if one can pa.s.s that, they can enter the academy.</p><br/><p>The highest grade is the 6th year grade so one would have quite the merit if they are in the fourth year.</p><br/><p>And so it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand why she was being so pompous but I can\u2019t accept the att.i.tude of looking down on others.</p><br/><p>\u201cOho, you can sure talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat n.o.ble, and now that woman and her meaningless pompousness, is the academy really okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahaha. Well, it does hurt when you say it like that. I mean, you are considered an elite if you graduate from the academy, right? And so the people who rank high in results tend to be very arrogant. She isn\u2019t a bad kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I guess that needs to be fixed as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>I aborted the conversation to dodge the topic.</p><br/><p>These kids are like problem children themselves.</p><br/><p>Who knows what kind of problems my Tempest Development of Human Resources Academy is facing.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a relief that that red-haired student had his ideals right but it is also a concern because he is being too docile. However, since there are some discriminating even among the teachers, this is a huge problem.</p><br/><p>If there are students and teachers like these all over the academy, I can\u2019t help but think there\u2019s someone intently wanting me to know about this so that I can eliminate the corruption\u2026</p><br/><p>Right, for example-</p><br/><p><i>&gt;</i></p><br/><p><i>Eh, *fuming*\u2026\u2026?</i></p><br/><p><i>It is true that I doubted this might be one of Ciel\u2019s scheme but she went and dodged the question before I even asked.</i></p><br/><p><i>But, I too am learning.

I thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Satoru\u2026no, Lord Rimuru! Please forgive Magnus!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as they entered, Karma bowed deeply and said those words.</p><br/><p>And then Julius followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagnus is our friend. But we didn\u2019t realize he was troubled, and we didn\u2019t consult him. We hadn\u2019t talked together about what we really felt. We couldn\u2019t. However, we would like to now. I want to say what I really feel, from the heart! So please, could you not give us that chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Julius expressed himself before lowering his head just as Karma had done.</p><br/><p>This was good.</p><br/><p>I now had a reason to forgive.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well. You can all share the responsibility for what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>At these words, Julius, Karma and Magnus all raised their faces at once.</p><br/><p>Rozari also looked at me with uncertainty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can all help each other. If one of you looks to be going down the wrong path, stop him. Do you agree that everything happened while you were my students? Teachers are responsible for what their students do. And so I will close my eyes in this case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo sat back in his chair gracefully and enjoyed his tea.</p><br/><p>Souei was pouring me a second cup.</p><br/><p>Neither of them said a word in protest.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo-so\u2026does that mean that we are forgiven\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rozari asked hesitantly.</p><br/><p>It was not me, but Diablo who answered her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe. Can I tell you something? When Lord Rimuru says he forgives you, he has forgiven all of your sins. He says he is going to close his eyes, so that means that you have all gotten away. But remember, there won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Souei added,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The real problem was with the school. In a way, you were all victims. This plan of raising personnel and sending them to the center was quite interesting. That alone is hardly a crime.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said.</p><br/><p>Exactly.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, brainwashing students was not good, but the rest was hardly an issue.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s how it is. I said as much to Irina, but when it comes to war, your perspective will change depending on which country you are with. Such is history. It cannot be helped that people wish for their country to have an advantage. That is why it is important to study the history of other countries as well as your own. It will help you understand both sides and judge fairly. Well, perhaps this is not the most convincing argument, since it\u2019s coming from the mouth of a Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>I finished.</p><br/><p>I was about to tell Magnus and the others to leave, when Godama caught my eye on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Oh, yes. Julius. You were shouting about how much you hated me, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo immediately reacted to this. Even Souei\u2019s eyebrows twitched.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, no\u2026that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sweat dripped from his handsome face as he desperately searched for the right words.</p><br/><p>Hehehe.</p><br/><p>I had mostly ignored his words, but I couldn\u2019t say that I wasn\u2019t just a little hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven I was a little wounded by having such words said to my face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

All is forgiven. But on one condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCondition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Take care of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>So saying, I pointed at Godama.</p><br/><p>Julius looked less than enthusiastic, but he agreed without complaint.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you are all responsible, you can take it around to the other schools. It will be a punishment for you, so you can take turns every year. I am sure that any student who thinks of doing something foolish will have a change of heart when they see this. It\u2019s two birds with one stone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rozari and the three others looked very unenthusiastic about it.</p><br/><p>That made me quite satisfied.</p><br/><p>I was able to get rid of the thing and also punish them at the same time.</p><br/><p>Hurrah!</p><br/><p>After that, I had all of the revolutionaries, or \u2018Human Emancipation Alliance\u2019 members taken in, as they seemed to have very extremist views.</p><br/><p>Souei\u2019s subordinates had already received the order, and they would be finished with this task shortly.</p><br/><p>I would hand them all over to Laplace, as they would make good workers.</p><br/><p>I was sure they would prove to be very useful.</p><br/><p>And just like that, the great cleansing of the school and driving out of the troublemakers was complete.</p><br/><p>\u2014Afterward.</p><br/><p>Julius, Magnus, Karma and the others of their class became legendary warriors whose names went down in history as the people who the Great Demon Lord once cooked for.</p><br/><p>Some of them, like Marsha, became actual heroes. As she was known as the forebearer of the new style of magic.</p><br/><p>My escape resulted in several other amusing stories as well, but those were for another time.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>After returning to Tempest.</p><br/><p>My body, Rimurun, was cruelly split into two.</p><br/><p>Well, as it was a slime, it had just split into two smaller slimes\u2026 Still, it was not a good feeling when you thought of it as your own body.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-this is\u2026um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! It was because Shuna wouldn\u2019t let go!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was surprising enough that Shuna would resist Shion\u2019s great strength.</p><br/><p>But more than that, I was shocked that my incredibly resilient body had been split into two.</p><br/><p>These two should not ever be angered.</p><br/><p>I promised to myself once again.</p><br/><p>By the way, I was able to return to normal by absorbing the two Rimurun bodies.</p><br/><p>Shuna and Shion looked a little sad, so I thought that I would give them a doll next time.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>The Forum was held in the Ingracia School City\u2013The development of magic and science.

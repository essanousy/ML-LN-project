In there, they spoke with the awakened Chloe.</p><br/><p>Because the string of tension was gone, the children were sleepy, and Glenda had taken them to rest in another room.</p><br/><p>The other Holy Knight seemed to have decided to rest as well after Hinata\u2019s revival made their tension disappear.</p><br/><p>Under pressure they had held the conference since morning and before they realized it, the day had turned to night.</p><br/><p>Although it was important to determine their future objective, with the appearance of the Demon Lord Ruminas, their hostility to the Holy Empire Ruberion now vanished during the talk.</p><br/><p>Even though they couldn\u2019t help but see the Freedom Association as an enemy, they never predicted that Yuuki had consolidated his power in each nation of Human Alliance.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Hinata\u2019s revival wiped out their despair and dispersed the heavy mood.</p><br/><p>For that reason, they would hold a real conference tomorrow.</p><br/><p>After guiding the three people, Nicholas instructed the maid to prepare the tea, and he embraced Hinata from behind, seeming like he doesn\u2019t want to be separated. Even if Hinata told him to go away,</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause I don\u2019t want to part with you again.\u300d(Nicholas)</p><br/><p>But there were no islands to hold on to.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Hinata ran out of patience and continued the conversation as if Nicolas didn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>Hinata\u2019s face turned red, but Nicholas can\u2019t see it. Chloe and Ruminas kindly turn a blind eye, and Hinata herself was happy.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m glad, Hinata.... You are safe. As Hinata\u2019s soul disappeared, I thought you died....\u300d(Chloe)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Chloe. I was surprised too. I never thought that Ruminas would come</p><br/><p>and assist in my revival.\u300d(Hinata)</p><br/><p>\u300cFumu. Speaking of which, the information network of the church hath expanded as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tis was for the sake of finding the one who durst steal Chloe from the Sacred Coffin[1] under m\u00edn protection.</p><br/><p>And, after knowing Chloe\u2019s revival, from the information besought, I cameth here.</p><br/><p>When This One arrived thither, the revived thee was not present.[2]\u300d</p><br/><p>While hearing the exchange, Chloe was in thought.</p><br/><p>Her expression was filled with wonder, as it wasn\u2019t a trivial matter.</p><br/><p>When Hinata and Ruminas who noticed this, they worried and tried to speak to her,</p><br/><p>\u300cI remembered. No...... I could remember.</p><br/><p>Apparently......</p><br/><p>I saw my demise in the future.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll be defeated by Yuuki and be killed in the future.</p><br/><p>It\u2019ll become a one-on-one fight with the Demon Lord Guy Crimson, using that opportunity Yuuki pierced the two of us together......</p><br/><p>However, on the verge of death, my Astral Body that holds the property of the spirit of time was thrown to the past.</p><br/><p>For the sake of sharing my knowledge and experience........</p><br/><p>As a result, the pastcurrent I, received help from Rimuru-sensei, and the rampaging was prevented during the spirit fusion.</p><br/><p>Therefore, this maybe my second life?</p><br/><p>Though I may have actually leapt many times.......</p><br/><p>Perhaps, even if I leaped many times in this world, I think I cannot learn everything.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the Hero\u2019s Astral Body that fused with me couldn\u2019t remember the knowledge and experiences of the future.</p><br/><p>Even now, because I can only remember the last life\u2019s memories, this may not be the second time.</p><br/><p>When I compare it with my memory, Hinata still being alive now is a miraculous thing.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just probably....for one thing, I succeeded in taking a different action from last time.</p><br/><p>Though, it\u2019s just a trivial action.</p><br/><p>As a result, time has now begun to follow a different route from the future that I remembered.</p><br/><p>What will happen in this world\u2019s future? I will witness it with my own eyes.</p><br/><p>And, I wish to save this world.\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe spoke while taking a sip of the black tea that had been prepared by the maid.</p><br/><p>The \u201cRemembered Past and Future[3]\u201d that she know.</p><br/><p>Last time, or the time she leapt so many times.</p><br/><p>Even with the fragment of the Hero\u2019s last bit of power that fused with Chloe, she can\u2019t convey the knowledge to herself at the time of Spirit Summoning by Rimuru.</p><br/><p>The ability she obtained was, Unique Skill\u300eTime Travel[4]\u300f, the power to do a limited leap to the past.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a one way trip, and the conditions to use this ability are complicated and its use is limited.</p><br/><p>Last time (Or every time), Chloe killed Hinata and leapt to the past.</p><br/><p>When she returned from the long time-travel and woke up, she killed Hinata.</p><br/><p>It should have been a fate that was repeated without changing.</p><br/><p>However, it\u2019s different this time.</p><br/><p>Up until now, Hinata didn\u2019t revive and Rimuru was dead.</p><br/><p>Hinata fought against Rimuru not only once.</p><br/><p>When Rimuru parted with Chloe and others in the Royal Capital, Chloe always clung to Rimuru in tears and detained him in his return to Tempest.</p><br/><p>As the result, some time was wasted, and Rimuru return to Tempest with\u300eSpatial Transfer\u300fin hurry.</p><br/><p>Hinata who was performing an ambush outside of the Royal Capital always missed meeting with Rimuru and the encounter between them never happened.</p><br/><p>It might be said that Yuuki\u2019s expectations always came off.</p><br/><p>However, this time Chloe didn\u2019t detain Rimuru</p><br/><p>She endured it as she wanted to be considered an adult by Rimuru. As a result, it can be said that the situation has greatly changed.</p><br/><p>First of all, the detained Rimuru returned to Tempest without encountering Hinata, and succeeded in protecting his subordinates.</p><br/><p>However, Tempest will be defeated by the hostile allied forces of the Western Saint\u2019 Church and Farmas Kingdom.</p><br/><p>The Holy Knight Order led by Hinata boasted an unparalleled strength, no matter how many of Rimuru\u2019s monster subordinates were stronger than a high rank devil, it was impossible for them to surpass that wall of strength.</p><br/><p>In the end, Rimuru fought Hinata in single combat and was completely annihilated on the spot.</p><br/><p>After getting a large quantity of souls from that war, Clayman awakened as a True Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>With the joint cooperation of Milim and Frey, Clayman\u2019s hosting of Walpurgis was approved. Naturally Ruminas also attended that conference.</p><br/><p>During that window, Yuuki began his move to steal the Sacred Coffin.</p><br/><p>When Hinata returned, by the order of the raging Ruminas, the Sacred Coffin Recovery Operation was accomplished in every time\u2019s flow.</p><br/><p>Chloe obtain Hinata\u2019s soul here and leap to the past, but because Hinata\u2019s soul was ruined due to the effect of Yuuki\u2019s Thought Control, \u201dCrystal of Curse\u201d, only the energy of her ability and her soul passed to Chloe.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t share their knowledge and feelings, Chloe gathered power by herself and she would go through a long time-travel.</p><br/><p>Therefore Hinata\u2019s ego returning when she awoke as the True Hero was unexpected.</p><br/><p>When Hinata fought the Hero, Ruminas was also in the middle of a fight.</p><br/><p>By the order of Clayman, Milim invaded.</p><br/><p>Or rather than an order, it was a suggestion.</p><br/><p>Clayman\u2019s cajolery was based on the advice from Yuuki that Rimuru\u2019s death was because of Ruminas\u2019s incitement.</p><br/><p>Deceived by those words, Milim raged.</p><br/><p>With Milim as the opponent, Ruminas was at disadvantage. She would be defeated by Milim after fighting for 3 days and 3 nights.</p><br/><p>However Milim can\u2019t be said to have been left unscathed, she would be killed in her weakened state by the awakened HeroChloe under Yuuki\u2019s order.</p><br/><p>Even if it became a slightly different future, if Milim knew the truth about Rimuru\u2019s death, Chloe couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>The fact that Chloe knew was only that Milim killed Ruminas.</p><br/><p>However, with this result, the fighting force of the Demon Lord\u2019s side greatly decreased.</p><br/><p>Milim, Ruminas, Karion. These three people disappeared.</p><br/><p>Karion who was hiding, protected by Frey was eventually killed after the disturbance.</p><br/><p>The East Empire started the invasion, the fight started against the Demon Lords due to Clayman.</p><br/><p>As a result, the world was wrapped in chaos.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the chaos, Chloe went to subjugate Guy by order of Yuuki and lost her life.</p><br/><p>This was the flow of events that Chloe knew until now, so it could be said that the current situation was vastly different.</p><br/><p>Finished hearing Chloe\u2019s story, silence descended in the room.</p><br/><p>The subject was too important to be ignored; therefore the girls felt that they wanted some time to think about this.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t confirm whether there were multiple time iterations; however they couldn\u2019t disregard the story about how the last world fell apart.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen the result where I was able to revive is really a coincidence..... \u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata muttered in one go.</p><br/><p>Actually, since her fight against Rimuru at the Royal Capital, Rimuru analyzed Hinata\u2018s ability to some extent and was able to take measures. </p><br/><p>If their first match was an all out battle where they couldn\u2019t retreat then there was no doubt he would have been defeated.</p><br/><p>And as a result, his return to his country was delayed because of his encounter with Hinata, and it led him to awaken as a Demon Lord, his awakening brings change to the flow and influences it greatly, in a way that Chloe couldn\u2019t even imagine.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a completely different route from last time.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Rimuru dispelling the curse from Hinata, she was able to return alive without her soul destroyed.</p><br/><p>For Ruminas too, the worst case in which Milim raided didn\u2019t happen, thus she was pleased as she can reunite with Chloe safely.</p><br/><p>In the past, the Hero saved Ruminas\u2019s life in her fight with Veldora.</p><br/><p>And so she became her first friend, for Ruminas she was her loved one.</p><br/><p>In promise with Chloe, the protection of the Sacred Coffin with Chloe sleeping inside was entrusted to Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Though she raged when the Sacred Coffin was stolen and went mad, still it was a fortunate that Ruminas carried it out without any trouble.</p><br/><p>This time, it can be said that everything is miraculous because it followed a good flow.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis One is glad that Chloe art safe above all else.</p><br/><p>Of course, if Hinata is a part of Chloe, Hinata returning alive also a joyous thing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c Yes, thank you. However, when thinking about this, the route of Fate is altered, it\u2019s a miracle.\u300d</p><br/><p>Everyone agrees with Hinata\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Those words hold a big meaning, big simply because her Will is a part of the Hero and Hinata was walking together with Chloe for a long time.</p><br/><p>The things she can do are limited even if she remembered the last memory from the Hero\u2019s Astral Body.</p><br/><p>Since it had been decided, there was nothing that could change the confirmed past.</p><br/><p>That is, in other words, until the moment of the Hero\u2019s birth in the future, any kind of attack cannot affect the Hero, and so she could be called Invincible.[5]</p><br/><p>The Chloe who flew to the past, her soul would be trained safely without any tremor.</p><br/><p>Since the result is fixed, it is protected from anything until it reached the event.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just like the self defense of a cocoon that waits for the time of its emergence as a butterfly.</p><br/><p>In the previous world, she needed to abide until the destined time when she developed into the Hero</p><br/><p>Therefore, it was impossible to kill the past Yuuki to change the future.</p><br/><p>Since Yuuki met with the child Chloe and said to take care of her was a \u201cConfirmed Event\u201d, until then Yuuki couldn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>The rule that protected the Hero\u2019s body applied to all events that the child Chloe recognized.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the effect of the ability that is the pivot of \u201cHero Upbringing Program[6]\u201d.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a compound effect of Unique Skill\u300eInfinity Prison[7]\u300fand Unique Skill\u300eTime Travel\u300f.</p><br/><p>Time has an absolute compelling force that keeps it following in a decided manner which can be referred to as Time Prison. That is how Chloe traveled through time.</p><br/><p>Therefore.</p><br/><p>Even if Chloe had the future memory, the things she could do were nearly none, as her own ability was restrained.</p><br/><p>After uniting with the Hero\u2019s Astral body in front of Rimuru, she could only fly back into the past to become her duplicate existence who had woken up, so there was no time where Chloe could do something.</p><br/><p>As for its significance, it can be said that the influence of the action of not detaining Rimuru showed the highest effect.</p><br/><p>The result in a world where Rimuru was detained, is Rimuru\u2019sdeath and Hinata\u2019s disappearance.\u3002</p><br/><p>The result in a world where Rimuru was not detained, is that Rimuru awoke as a Demon King and Hinata acquired \u201cHero\u2019s Egg\u201d.</p><br/><p>Certainly as Hinata had said, it\u2019s a coincidental result.</p><br/><p>However, that coincidence brings too convenient a result.</p><br/><p>Even acquiring Hero\u2019s Egg, properly speaking, was something that could only be born after Chloe received the energy flowing from Hinata\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>Even in that aspect, the present Chloe is strong when compared to past Chloe.</p><br/><p>Because she went to the past together with Hinata\u2019s Will, Chloe didn\u2019t taste solitude. And under the tutoring of Hinata, an excellent teacher, she was able to learn all the skills that Hinata had known.</p><br/><p>Because of that the foundation was made......</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015She awoke the Ultimate Skill\u300eSpace-Time King (Yog-Sothoth)[8]\u300f\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Thanks to this ability she was able to recall the future memory.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a thing that Chloe from previous iterations was not able to do.</p><br/><p>Originally, Hinata\u2019s\u300eMathematician\u300fand\u300eUsurper\u300f were unified with\u300eAbsolute Severance\u300fand\u300eInfinity Prison\u300fand she acquired Ultimate Skill\u300eHope King (Sariel)[9]\u300f.</p><br/><p>This time, she absorbed the energy from Hinata\u2019s Soul without a problem, so she could remain without being mixed, and Hinata\u2019s soul could be revived in pure form.</p><br/><p>What it brought was an absolute power that rules over time and space.</p><br/><p>It was the awakening of two abilities called Ultimate Skill\u300eSpace-Time King (Yog-Sothoth)\u300f and\u300eHope King (Sariel)\u300f.</p><br/><p>Chloe who awoke this ability and obtained an ability to memorize and repeat the time she spent on this moment again and again.</p><br/><p>During combat, she was able to start over again after she saw the enemy\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>That absolute superiority Chloe had, made Hero Chloe becomes the strongest existence.</p><br/><p>And.....</p><br/><p>Chloe understood the awakened ability.</p><br/><p>The existence released from the Law of the World, people who posses Ultimate Skills.</p><br/><p>Ruminas in front of her.</p><br/><p>Rimuru that Chloe loves.</p><br/><p>And she realized that Rimuru\u2019s existence was necessary to rewrite destiny.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, because Rimuru obtained an Ultimate Skill, he slipped out from the Law of the World, and so he might be the reason of the current miracle?</p><br/><p>No, more than that.</p><br/><p>In the last time, if by chance Rimuru survived, wouldn\u2019t he have awakened an Ultimate Skill?</p><br/><p>Such a question appeared in her mind.</p><br/><p>If Rimuru survived after his companions were killed and he was in despair and anger..........</p><br/><p>By some means, he helped Chloe, so that she might to interfere the past?[10]</p><br/><p>(No, even if it\u2019s Sensei, that\u2019s not possible)</p><br/><p>Chloe shook off her imagination and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u300cI has stayed for too long, though it\u2019s not necessary for me to be always near Yuuki.\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe said so and prepared to return.</p><br/><p>Despite obtaining an Ultimate Skill, Yuuki\u2019s control, \u201cThe Order (Wish) of Three[11]\u201d is still effective.</p><br/><p>She guessed this is because Yuuki also has an Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>Chloe can\u2019t attack Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even with the strongest ability, she can\u2019t attack Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Since his wish is to bring chaos to the world, it\u2019s necessary to defeat him someday.</p><br/><p>When she tells this to Hinata and Ruminas,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t be reckless, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. Yuuki is an enemy to This One. Chloe, don\u2019t do a dangerous thing, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUfufu, It\u2019s all right! I can\u2019t lay my hand on Yuuki, similarly Yuuki cannot do so to me.</p><br/><p>If he turns his hand on me, his control is released.</p><br/><p>Therefore, I\u2019m safe. Because, unlike the former world, this world is stable.</p><br/><p>But, if you want to be careful...... it will be the movement of the East Empire.</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s subordinates have already prepared it, it\u2019s necessary to push forward preparations so that this side responds to it too.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s possible, you should tie the neighboring countries of the Great Jura Forest in a large alliance.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Empire in the East? Fie, an enemy of This One\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s no use, Ruminas. Overconfidence is prohibited!</p><br/><p>For the East Empire, Summoners ruled, so there were many \u2018Otherworlder[12]\u2019.</p><br/><p>People who have high combat ability that Yuuki summoned belong to the army of the East Empire.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not a war potential that can be trifled with, and there are many people who are stronger than a high rank devil.</p><br/><p>Above all else....In that country, there is the \u201cScorching Dragon Velgurind[13]\u201d.</p><br/><p>You must never let your guard down.\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe warns Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Ruminas also changed her thinking after hearing Chloe\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>If the Empire has a reliable force that organized and begins a military campaign, it\u2019s surely a threat.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen as expected, the very best thing is to visit Rimuru and suggest an alliance right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. I think that Sensei will surely help.</p><br/><p>Or rather, I think that Sensei has the key to save this world.\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe agreed to Hinata\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Though Ruminas envied Rimuru a little, she decided to endure it and agreed.</p><br/><p>The Monster\u2019s Country Tempest and the Western Saint\u2019 Church. And also the Holy Empire Ruberion.</p><br/><p>In the girls\u2019 discussion, the objective to conclude an alliance was decided.</p><br/><p>After it is realized, it would later be called the \u201cSaint-Demon Alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>-------</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>Explanation time. I wrote it and was confused.</p><br/><p>I notice that the consistency was sketchy and I couldn\u2019t write freely when I began to think about the concept of time.</p><br/><p>Though it almost got mixed up several times, but is it alright?</p><br/><p>I pray that there will be no fatal mistakes found in there.</p><br/><p>This time Chloe succeeded in moving the world\u2019s time-line!</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t the world\u2019s time-line volatility change by about 1%?</p><br/><p>By the way, she acquired Reading Steiner too this time![14]</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p>Translator Note</p><br/><p>I\u2019m very sorry if you are confused by Chloe\u2019s explanation about her time leaping experiences.</p><br/><p>Feel free to ask questions.\\</p><br/><p>Here the Resized version</p><br/><p>[1] Seihitsu \u2013 Sacred Coffin Lit.

Kagali who hid behind Chloe, ducked her head and opened her eyes wide.</p><br/><p>\u300cTime,time out! What in the world is happening here!?\u300d</p><br/><p>It was a high-speed battle, too quick for Kagali to perceive, she could only see traces of it.</p><br/><p>Which side has the advantage? The result is unknown. </p><br/><p>\u300cAt a glance, the situation seems even. However.....\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015however\uff1f\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see that Leon Onii-chan\u2019s still holds the advantage and has lead the situation as he desired.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not very good at analyzing, Chloe spoke while thinking that, as they watched the fight. </p><br/><p>\u300cHaa? That\u2019s a bit vague. Then, which side will win?\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe remained silent for a while,</p><br/><p>\u300cIf the conditions remain just as they are now, Leon Onii-chan will win\u300d</p><br/><p>She declared.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm. Whatever. Although I will declare something too, Yuuki-sama will not be defeated. Definitely.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kagali forcefully made an assertion.</p><br/><p>Chloe glanced at Kagali and neither denied nor confirmed her assertion.</p><br/><p>The Black Knight Claude said nothing and put down his held up hand. Claude, who had been seriously injured by Leon\u2019s blow, was now fully healed. He was amazed that even the black armor was completely restored.</p><br/><p>Gently putting her finger over the wide-eyed Claude\u2019s lip, Chloe slightly shook her head. With just that she drove Claude out of her mind and Chloe returned her focus to Leon and Yuuki\u2019s fight.</p><br/><p>The Black Knight Claude stood up beside Chloe without saying anything.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, can you see the fight between those two?\u300d</p><br/><p>Kagali asked Claude who had stood up.</p><br/><p>However, Claude only answered with a nod instead of words.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch. You seemed to be monstrous enough to be capable of following such a fight with your eyes.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s ok. After all, it will be a victory for Yuuki-sama, you should ascertain the victory of your new master as well. \u300d</p><br/><p>After saying that much, Kagali sat down on a convenient rock with an uninterested expression.</p><br/><p>Of course, she sat in a spot where Chloe could still act as a barrier and protect her.</p><br/><p>Their level of combat was far above what she could perceive, and Kagali didn\u2019t even have the slightest bit of experience necessary to comprehend the fight anyway. What\u2019s more, this girl fully believed in Yuuki\u2019s victory, so she didn\u2019t have any interest in watching the battle.</p><br/><p>Claude, unlike Kagali, was still bewildered by his current situation.</p><br/><p>However, after being admonished by Chloe, he didn\u2019t dare foolishly reveal his current state. Actually, his consciousness, thanks to Chloe, had returned to the him still pledging his allegiance to Leon.</p><br/><p>Chloe\u2019s ability was not to recovery. The true nature of it was rewinding time.</p><br/><p>She rewound time to make it so that the situation where Yuuki did the Overwrite never happened. Without changing the surroundings\u2019 time, it was possible to use the ability to affect only limited number of people.</p><br/><p>This ability was the ultimate power. It is not limited to erasing damage, but even abnormal status\u2015\u2015in other words, fatigue or even death\u2015\u2015 will become nonexistent.</p><br/><p>However, it\u2019s unfortunate that the Red\u2019s revival was impossible. Because Yuuki used his depriving ability, there was no way to interfere.</p><br/><p>Although it was an absolute power, it was not almighty.</p><br/><p>Chloe knew that well. Besides, she had just acquired the ability and could not wield it fully.</p><br/><p>Her wish to revive the Red Knight was difficult to fulfill.</p><br/><p>There was no one that would condemn her, however she looked at the Red Knight with a sad expression.</p><br/><p>There was nothing that she could do, since she couldn\u2019t move without permission.</p><br/><p>While letting out a sigh, Chloe focused on the fight.</p><br/><p>Leon and Yuuki. The fight between those two had just begun.</p><br/><p>However, as Chloe\u2019s eyes focused, she saw clearly that the state of the fight had changed greatly.</p><br/><p>Yuuki felt a deep regret for his erroneous impression.</p><br/><p>He had underestimated his opponent.</p><br/><p>Leon Cromwell, a newcomer Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>A former Human, the Demon Lord who defeated Kagali=Kazaream.</p><br/><p>Because Kagali was too weak, it could be said that he had estimated Leon\u2019s power as being low.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, thanks to the fact that an Ultimate Skill had awakened in him, he couldcontinue fighting. He was certain that if he hadn\u2019t acquired the skill he would have already been defeated.</p><br/><p>(Or rather, I didn\u2019t think that he was this strong)</p><br/><p>He kept thinking as warded off the blow from the light that was unleashed towards him.</p><br/><p>He could feel that his energy was reduced by a large amount when warding attacks. If this situation continued, his defeat was merely a matter of time.</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s ability specialized in stealing things. Its main use was to take the enemy\u2019s energy. With this ability, he could recover his power while he attacked, so normally this ability could be called omnipotent in attack and defense.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the case when the opponent is not Leon.</p><br/><p>The attribute of Leon\u2019s ability is Light=Purification. This attribute specialized in purifying demons, in other words, it\u2019s an ability fitting for a Hero.</p><br/><p>Because this person was a Demon Lord, Yuuki couldn\u2019t help but feel that the ironic situation was a great big joke.</p><br/><p>Though there was no use in complaining, Yuuki\u2019s acquired ability was part of the demon series[1], meaning it had a demonic attribute[2]. Every time he attacked, he received purification, meaning he received damage.</p><br/><p>Much of the energy that he\u2019d stolen had been purified. Furthermore, he couldn\u2019t evade the opponent\u2019s attack and he can\u2019t help but to notice the large amount of damage he received with each encounter.</p><br/><p>(This isn\u2019t good, right? I will lose if this situation continues.)</p><br/><p>He thought about his next plan optimistically.</p><br/><p>In the worst case scenario, he could involve Chloe. However, he wished to avoid that. It would become difficult to lead the world to destruction if he did that.</p><br/><p>The reason was simple. It would become impossible for him to defeat the strongest entities in this world known as Guy Crimson and Milim Nava.</p><br/><p>And Rimuru as well.</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s intuition told him that the Slime he met was an abnormality. Its growth speed was abnormal, and his gaze was impenetrable. That gaze felt uncomfortable, so he had judged that it was impossible to ignore Rimuru.</p><br/><p>(\u2014I never thought that Rimuru-san could see through my true nature\u2026Still, I get the feeling it will be dangerous if I don\u2019t get rid of that person quickly.)</p><br/><p>For such a thing, it was preferable to use Chloe.</p><br/><p>Two strong people and one dangerous person.</p><br/><p>Yuuki had judged Milim was someone that could easily be deceived. Therefore the real problem was Guy and Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Yuuki felt uneasy leaving Guy as Chloe\u2019s only opponent. Therefore he was going to get rid of Rimuru.</p><br/><p>After that, he would make Chloe fight Guy, it was a plan to get rid of the two of them at the same time.</p><br/><p>It seemed it would be difficult to defeat Rimuru later if he used Chloe now.</p><br/><p>Feeling such a premonition, Yuuki didn\u2019t give Chloe an order.</p><br/><p>Well then, what did he need to do right now?</p><br/><p>The best he could do in the contract he made with Chloe was for her not to disrupt Yuuki\u2019s decree. However it wasn\u2019t a problem for petty orders. Chloe probably was a good natured person, so if he requested it of her, she might listen.</p><br/><p>But withdrawing from here would still be impossible even if she protected Yuuki and the rest.</p><br/><p>(If it had been Rimuru and Ruminas that had come over, it would have gone just as planned\u2026)</p><br/><p>Yuuki let out a sigh and decided to discard his hesitation and use his trump card.</p><br/><p>He regretted that he had misunderstood Leon\u2019s strength, and after he escaped he needed to reflect on this. He needed to make a decision soon, since his eminent defeat wouldn\u2019t be a joke.</p><br/><p>\u300cHaha, Leon. I\u2019m sorry. I underestimated you too much.</p><br/><p>Therefore, I\u2019ve decide to use my trump card!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFu, do as you like. It will be useless.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAfter putting up such a bluff, please don\u2019t say something cowardly okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki activated the combined ability of\u300eSummoner\u300fand his Ultimate Skill\u300eAvaricious King Mammon\u300f, and a very large magic circle began to appear on the ground. Within the circle were numerous corpses composed of Yuuki\u2019s subordinates and the Red Knight. Their bodies began to expand and became lumps of flesh. Then the wriggling, wicked thing that crawled out of Yuuki\u2019s magic circle mixed with the lumps of flesh\u2026</p><br/><p>It let out a roar in fury.</p><br/><p>In the past, the originator of the dragon race, \u201cStar King Dragon Veldanava,\u201d had given his daughter a dragon as guardian (pet)[3].</p><br/><p>The dragon possessing great power had fallen into a trap and was killed by a certain kingdom.</p><br/><p>When the girl, it\u2019s master, evolved, its body was changed into a chaos dragon, full of fiendish power.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it lacked a soul, making it transcend beyond the confines of good and evil into an incarnation of destruction.</p><br/><p>It was said that the girl, grieving over the sad twist of fate, sealed the dragon where nobody would find it.</p><br/><p>However, after many years and months had passed, miasma[4] was released from its body, running the surrounding nature.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the Freedom Association received requests to investigate the cause of the wicked miasma.</p><br/><p>\u300cAwaken, Chaos Dragon! Your true master is me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Using the awakened dragon, he was going to get rid of the pursuing Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>In his original plan, he was going to escape while the dragon rampaged.</p><br/><p>However, it was different now. Right now, by using the Ultimate Skill\u300eGreedy King Mammon\u300f, the Chaos Dragon\u2019s master was Yuuki.</p><br/><p>The Chaos Dragon that had just awakened, released an overwhelming pressure, and absorbed the surrounding magic power to build up its own power.</p><br/><p>As a direct descendent of the dragon race, its total length exceeded 20m.</p><br/><p>Right now, the strongest dragon moved according to Yuuki\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>The roar and miasmic breath it spouted corroded the rocky surface and the arbor, from the hillside to the summit, crumbled.</p><br/><p>This was the Chaos Dragon\u2019s ability, Chaotic Breath.</p><br/><p>Yuuki sported a proud smile and Kagali turned pale.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t visible in Claude\u2019s expression, it looked like he believed in his master Leon.</p><br/><p>Chloe clenched her fist. If by any chance Leon was defeated, she decided she would destroy the Chaos Dragon with her own hands.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha! What do you think? This is something that you can\u2019t deal with so easily.</p><br/><p>Right now, if you swear fidelity to me, I will gladly make you my companion, how does that sound?\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon laughed scornfully at Yuuki\u2019s proposal.</p><br/><p>He had predicted this development. Furthermore, he hadn\u2019t obstructed the summoning.</p><br/><p>That was because\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected, it was a Chaos Dragon\u2015\u2015.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re a fool, to revive a revenant from ancient times, do you wish to incur the wrath of the Dragon Princess Milim?</p><br/><p>It will be transmitted to Milim as soon as I cut the soul\u2019s connection.</p><br/><p>It the end for you, Kagurazaka Yuuki.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c......I see. You realized it and didn\u2019t let me do as I pleased.</p><br/><p>Even so, won\u2019t you already be dead before Milim arrives?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu, do you want to try and see?\u300d</p><br/><p>Erasing his expression, Yuuki gave an order to the Chaos Dragon.</p><br/><p>Kill the enemy before you!</p><br/><p>The Chaos Dragon was certainly strong. Its power was second to the \u201cDragon Kind\u201d and seemed to reign as the strongest monster that appeared in nature.</p><br/><p>However, this mindless monster didn\u2019t have any wisdom. It was an incarnation of violence that just rampaged and attacked without reason.</p><br/><p>In case the previous Demon Lords hadn\u2019t awakened, it might have exceeded them in brute force and overwhelming energy. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Leon was a genius, moreover his attribute was Light=Purification.</p><br/><p>His existence was such that could be called the natural enemy of the Chaos Dragon.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will say it once more. You are underestimating me.</p><br/><p>The reason I deliberately gave you time for the summoning was to showthe difference between our powers and that what you have done today, in this place, is fruitless.</p><br/><p> I will show you a piece of my power!\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon was wrapped in a golden light whilehe talked.</p><br/><p>Golden Wings, constructed with pure light energy, appeared on his back.</p><br/><p>His wings resembled the wings of the angel race, but in reality his wings were totally a stream of light itself.</p><br/><p>And, he held the Flame Pillar (Holy Flame Rapier)[5], which had manifested in his right hand.</p><br/><p>It was a Mythical class (Gods)[6] rapier, the strongest sword in Leon\u2019s possession. A pattern of beautiful bluish white flame stood out on its flexible, thin blade.</p><br/><p>Leon held a Golden Circle (Golden Round Shield)[7] in his left hand and the rapier in his right.</p><br/><p>It was a legend class shield as good as armor, but it had high defense ability because it was mixed with Leon\u2019s Holy Aura. In reality, the shield could suppress the damage from an attack of demonic attribute by reducing up to half of it with purification.</p><br/><p>Fully armed, Leon glanced at Yuuki who\u2019d lost his smile and then moved his eyes to Chaos Dragon as though he had lost interest in Yuuki.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems I will incur Milim\u2019s hostility if I kill you. Since that\u2019s the case, I will only make you fall asleep again!</p><br/><p>Oh Holy spirits, flutter! Triangle Pyramid (Sacred Tetrahedron Demon Sealing Barrier)[8]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>A small tetrahedron with four pillars made from crystallized spirits grew large and in accordance to Leon\u2019s will, it wrapped around the Chaos Dragon.</p><br/><p>This was the ultimate holy attribute barrier that even surpassed Holy Field.</p><br/><p>The Barrier that Leon had constructed was given the [effect\uff1aeternity], where the captured person was confined. It was a high-class sealing technique that rivaled\u300eInfinite Prison\u300f. No, the effect may even surpass\u300eInfinite Prison\u300fif the target had a demonic attribute.</p><br/><p>With the existence of this barrier, Leon could possibly win against Guy just once. Of course, if it was Guy, he would instantly sense the danger of the barrier, and not get caught by it. Therefore, not to bedisparaging, but the success rate against Guy was only about 1 in 1000 attempts.</p><br/><p>However, if the target was a mindless monster, it couldn\u2019t defend against this technique.</p><br/><p>The poor Chaos Dragon struggled to break the seal, but its resistance was futile.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, when the barrier\u2019s effect activated, it sucked the magic power from the Chaos Dragon and used it to reinforce the barrier\u2019s strength. When it came to this, its movements were already sealed.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like the lifecycle barrier that Milim had erected, no matter how much energy the Chaos Dragon possessed, as it was, it could vanish before 100 years had passed.</p><br/><p>In this matter, Leon thought that Milim could possibly resent him for this, but if he released the seal and handed it over to Milim then it would be fine. It would be troublesome to incur Milim\u2019s wrath, but it wasn\u2019t really something that he should be thinking of right now. He modified the barrier settings, so that it would immediately be buried under the ground.</p><br/><p>In the end, the Chaos Dragon was sealed again in instant by Leon.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This could not be called a battle, it was an event symbolizing Leon\u2019s overwhelming strength.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, did your trump card end with this? If it\u2019s over, it\u2019s my turn now.\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon looked at Yuuki and spoke mercilessly.</p><br/><p>Leon had completely settled the situation in his favor and Yuuki\u2019s chance of victory could be deemed as nonexistent.</p><br/><p>But,</p><br/><p>\u300cAhahahaha! I never thought that a Demon Lord was amazing, to this degree!</p><br/><p>Honestly, I underestimated it. Even so, I already took the source of that dragon\u2019s power, I don\u2019t need it anymore.</p><br/><p>I have restored the damage I received from you.</p><br/><p>Then, should I get serious now? \u300d</p><br/><p>Exactly as stated by Yuuki, his both hands were covered with dragon scales,his body is was covered by the same miasma that had covered the Chaos Dragon not long ago.</p><br/><p>It was almost like it had transformed into an ominous black armor resembling the scales of dragon.</p><br/><p>Leon recalled the buried barrier to himself,</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard!\u300d</p><br/><p>He shouted at Yuuki.</p><br/><p>The Chaos Dragon became bone, it weathered and then crumbled.</p><br/><p>It was the result of the dragon losing its power. Just as Yuuki had said, he had deprived it of its very core.</p><br/><p>With this, Milim\u2019s wrath is! The moment Leon thought about that\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you think now is the right time to worry about that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki leapt behind Leon\u2019s with a speed incomparable to before.</p><br/><p>And delivered a strong kick to Leon\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Yuuki, who had taken the power of the dragon,had become a Dragon Warrior.He put more effort into the fight, </p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t get cocky, you insect!\u300d </p><br/><p>Golden lights were emitted intensely and completely dyed the area pure white.</p><br/><p>Inside the torrent of light that blinded people\u2019s eyes was Leon who stood glaring angrily at Yuuki, his body wrapped in white-gold armor.</p><br/><p>The 36 pairs of 72 wings appeared once more on his back. They had vanished when he had used barrier before, but it manifest again when Leon\u2019s virtually unlimited holy aura was released.</p><br/><p>Light Angel Leon vs Dragon Warrior Yuuki </p><br/><p>The fight was settled in an instant.</p><br/><p>Leon, who burned with anger, delivered intense attacks towards Yuuki without giving him the chance to counterattack.</p><br/><p>With a flowing elegant thrusting speed that approach the speed of light, Leon\u2019s Flame Pillar made Yuuki\u2019s entire body instantly became bloody.</p><br/><p>The ominous black armor that was the crystallization of the Chaos Dragon\u2019s power was smashed to pieces, unable to withstand the sword endowed with the power of purification.</p><br/><p>As for the difference in power, the gap was vast, like that between an adult and a child.</p><br/><p>(Damn, it can\u2019t be... to this extent...)</p><br/><p>Yuuki, felt his own ego weakening, seemingly disappearing.</p><br/><p>If this situationcontinued, it would not be not good. If things kept going like this, his defeat was certain.</p><br/><p>Above all.......</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Well then, will it be my turn soon?</p><br/><p>(Not yet, I\u2019m not defeated yet!)</p><br/><p>Yuuki gathered up his disappearing consciousness,</p><br/><p>\u300cDidn\u2019t I said it would be useless? You are not even capable of following my movement\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki lost sight of Leon, who was standing in front of him, and his left arm is cut by Leon\u2019s Flame Pillar and flung away.</p><br/><p>An acute pain attacked Yuuki, and his control of the power had already become unsteady.</p><br/><p>He fell to the ground and crouched down. His severed arm stopped bleeding, and he glared at Leon who hovered over him, looking down at him.</p><br/><p>The outcome was already determined. Yuuki seemed to have misunderstood Leon\u2019s overwhelming strength.</p><br/><p>The difference between the strength he took from the ancient dragon, the power of the Chaos Dragon, and Leon\u2019s was not good.</p><br/><p>It was just like Leon had said, even if he awoke an Ultimate Skill, the difference in the ability was like heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s the end\u300d</p><br/><p>Just as Leon declares the ultimatum, a multi-layered 3D magic circle formed with Leon in the center and took in Yuuki.</p><br/><p>The magic circle kept radiating and flickering in a radiant color, and then it was completed in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u300cPerish, \u201cHoly Breakdown (36th Style Annihilation\u2019s Light of Holy Spirit Purification)[9]\u201d!\u300d</p><br/><p>Twinkling lights radiated from his 36 pairs of wings.</p><br/><p>When the lights collided with the layered barrier, they were reflected irregularly and filled the inside of the barrier with light.</p><br/><p>It was a wild dance of photons that broke down the things it touched. It was Leon\u2019s greatest and strongest wide area annihilation ability.</p><br/><p>The annihilation percentage inside the limited space covered by the barrier was 100%, it was an inescapable technique.</p><br/><p>Yuuki who was still crouched down on the ground with his severed left arm, had his body mercilessly pierced by the lights.</p><br/><p>When the inside of the barrier is filled with lights, photons are generated, and the ability concludes.</p><br/><p>This ability generatesenergy several thousand times greater than the \u201cDisintegration\u201d that Hinatahad used, and all objects within the barrier are disintegrated.</p><br/><p>And then, the inside of the barrier was filled with lights.</p><br/><p>A flash.</p><br/><p>When the magic circle disappeared, the lights calmed down.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s was only one person standing on the ground.</p><br/><p>However, that person seemed unhappy,</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, he escaped, huh\u300d</p><br/><p>He muttered.</p><br/><p>So.</p><br/><p>Standing on the ground alone was Leon.</p><br/><p>Yuuki who had confirmed Leon\u2019s overwhelming strength and realized his own defeat, had decided to retreat when his left arm was cut off.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he had made the full use of his maximum strength and earned a little time with Thought Guidance.</p><br/><p>The perfect chance to escape appeared when Leon was concentrating on the constructing the barrier.</p><br/><p>However, one ought to praise Yuuki. His stubbornness deserved appreciation, he didn\u2019t surrender until the end of the fight.</p><br/><p>But, that didn\u2019t change the fact that he ran away. Leon, had promised to cooperate with the two demon lords, and when he thought about the possibility Milim would turn her rage towards him, he felt depressed.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood grief, I must be more serious.\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems that the goal of obtaining Chloe\u2019s freedom would be delayed a bit longer, since Yuuki had escaped</p><br/><p>This strategy was a complete failure.</p><br/><p>It could be said that the moment Yuuki succeeded in retreating, he had strategically won the war. Leon had won the battle but lost the war.</p><br/><p>As Leon thought of the future, there was a complete lack of the taste of victory, and he sighed.</p><br/><p>[1]  Akuma Kei \u2013 Demon series/system.</p><br/><p>[2]  Ma Zokusei \u2013 Demon/Devil/Evil/Demonic/Magic Attribute/Property.</p><br/><p>[3] (\u30da\u30c3\u30c8) Goei Ryuu (Petto) \u2013 Guardian Dragon = Pet.

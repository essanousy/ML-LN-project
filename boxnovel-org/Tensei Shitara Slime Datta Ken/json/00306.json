He was in the absolute magic space. The situation was to our advantage. And yet, we could not win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible\u2026\u201d\u201cThey were utterly defeated. Diablo came out without a scratch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>They all gasped.</p><br/><p>This report was so shocking that they did not want to believe it.</p><br/><p>Melhis continued, as if to dispel the oppressive air.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that Diablo\u2019s power was stronger than what we imagined. The Accommodationists are not worth discussing, but the Moderates did have a point about being against hostilities. I understand that now. He saw my face, but the rest of you who have not made contact, it\u2019s not too late. You should join the Moderates-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot allow that. All of you are to be arrested right here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Melhis\u2019s words were interrupted by a cold, echoing voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho-who is it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who answered Melhis was a single man who stood in front of the door.</p><br/><p>The dark skin and blue hair\u2013it was Souei.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. There\u2019s no need for you to know, but I will be polite this once. My name is Souei. One of Lord Rimuru\u2019s faithful servants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Souei said in answer to Melhis.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, what happened to the guards?\u201d</p><br/><p>Melhis looked around frantically. Their mouths had been sealed before being made unconscious on the floor.</p><br/><p>And not one person in the room had noticed. It was done silently.</p><br/><p>Damn it! Melhis cursed inwardly.</p><br/><p>She had been so careful about being tracked. This was the worst possible thing that could happen now.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not panic! Glory Knights, prepare for demon fusion! There is no future for us unless we defeat him first!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Roused by these words, the Glory Knight started to act.</p><br/><p>They called the demons within them and made the power their own.</p><br/><p>With such comrades surrounding her, Melhis told herself that it wasn\u2019t too late.</p><br/><p>The enemy was alone.</p><br/><p>And there were five of the Glory Knights here.</p><br/><p>Diablo was one of the 12 guardians of the Great Demon King. But they had never even heard of this Souei before.</p><br/><p>They could win! This single demon could not stand against them.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what Melhis thought.</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s what she tried to believe.</p><br/><p>She could never have imagined that the person standing in front of them now was the equal of the guardians.</p><br/><p>In spite of her instincts raising the highest alarm in her head, Melhis made the worst decision.</p><br/><p>Go hostile\u2013immediately.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Five Glory Knights stood in front of Souei.</p><br/><p>However, they did not act against him.</p><br/><p>No, they were not able to.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what? I cannot move my body?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Damn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The knights realized the change and became frantic.</p><br/><p>But there was no answer coming, and Melhis was left confused, unable to understand the situation.</p><br/><p>The only person here who grasped everything was Souei.</p><br/><p>And Souei did nothing.</p><br/><p>He had no need to.</p><br/><p>Because\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSouei, would you like me to finish them for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Out of nowhere, a woman had arrived and stood in front of Souei.</p><br/><p>The beautiful dragonewt, Souka.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let a single one get away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Touka, Saika, Hokusou and Nansou were also there.</p><br/><p>This hideout had already been completely surrounded by the information department working for Souei.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Glory Knights shouted.</p><br/><p>However, their shouts faded into the air.</p><br/><p>To Souka and the others, these knights, who had merely overcome the barrier of A-rank, were nothing.</p><br/><p>Besides\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I think it\u2019s time we take our leave\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The greater demons that had been fused with the knights now attempted to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Do you mean to ignore the contract!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The knights shouted in horror. But the demons snorted.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

Our contracts are voided if we are not able to run wild as we please!\u201d</p><br/><p>So saying, they began to escape.</p><br/><p>Unlike spirits, demons tended to be self-centered. And so they often abandoned their masters the moment that the situation became unfavorable.</p><br/><p>However, this time alone, the demons were unable to avoid the disaster.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think I will let you get away? Souei said that I was to let no one escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>Souka\u2019s cold voice rang in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? How!?\u201d</p><br/><p>But it was too late for the greater demons.</p><br/><p>Because now the entire building was surrounded by a magic circle of envelopment that isolated the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no use for those demons. Kill them so they can repent for a few hundred years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>And so the demons were dealt with just as Souei ordered.</p><br/><p>Before the demons could even say anything, Souka and the others had turned them into dust.</p><br/><p>It all happened in an instant.</p><br/><p>The members of the \u2018Humanity Emancipation Alliance\u2019 were speechless.</p><br/><p>Some of them fell weakly to the floor while others moaned audibly.</p><br/><p>Seeing the greater demons disposed of like this had made them certain about their fate.</p><br/><p>Melhis as well.</p><br/><p>(\u2026It\u2019s over. Great Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s subordinates are so\u2026 Magnus, I am so sorry\u2026)</p><br/><p>They were strong on a level that defied her understanding.</p><br/><p>Like Godama, Melhis now realized that she had come in contact with something that should have been avoided at all cost.</p><br/><p>But it was much too late now. And there was no way for them to get out of this.</p><br/><p>That was enough to break her spirit.</p><br/><p>And like that, the majority of the Reformist members fell at the hand of Souei.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. So it is done, Souei?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Thanks to you scaring them out of the nest, I was able to find them all gathered together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is wonderful. I too was able to capture one of the leaders. And don\u2019t worry, I treated him very carefully and without killing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. I\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Souei brushed this comment aside.</p><br/><p>In fact, he thought it would not have been a problem to kill one or two of them.</p><br/><p>No mercy for our enemies! It was an unspoken rule, and Rimuru was not likely to be angry about it.</p><br/><p>The only reason he hadn\u2019t related this to Diablo, was because it was too much trouble.</p><br/><p>Besides, there would be no stopping Diablo once he went out of control. And so it was best to avoid the possibility altogether.</p><br/><p>Especially since he would likely be given the role of having to stop him. And Souei did not care to be bothered with that.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven now he is being eaten by demon bugs. Can you hear his gleeful screams?\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo said as he threw the tree-like thing off of his shoulder.</p><br/><p>It was a ravaged Godama.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.His entire body was being eaten by bugs and he was barely breathing.</p><br/><p>Of course, Godama\u2019s fate was more than that. The places that were being eaten were slowly turning into tree bark.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe-help me. It hurts. My whole body hurts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In this pitiful state, he plead for mercy.</p><br/><p>However, Diablo did not respond to his pleas.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hey, while he is alive, there will be little point if he loses his mind, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Souei said. Diablo nodded as if he understood this perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehehe. Don\u2019t worry. These Majuju do not eat the brain. And they excrete two kinds of liquids when eating flesh. One has the effect of turning the host into a tree. The other is a pleasure substance. This means that while they can feel pain, it is not so bad that they would lose their minds. Besides, he had something that was perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>So saying, Diablo pointed to the staff that was practically a part of Godama now.</p><br/><p>It was the unique magic rod that Godama had carried for many years\u2013the \u2018Staff of Heart Protection\u2019</p><br/><p>Due to Godama\u2019s excellent equipment, his heart was protected, preventing him from going mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Well, he did insult Lord Rimuru. So it is his own fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo nodded with satisfaction at Souei\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>And then in a rare display of affection, Diablo slapped Souei on the shoulder and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, Souei. I am so glad that you have an understanding of my hobbies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No. I\u2019m not saying your hobbies are acceptable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Souei had a bitter expression, a strong contrast to the one of pleasure that was on Diablo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>However, Diablo did not mind. He laughed happily at the prospect of having someone who was of kindred-spirit.</p><br/><p>And with that, they left the rest to Souka and the others, and headed for their final destination.</p><br/><p>Maldoland Island.</p><br/><p>\u2013The place where their beloved Rimuru was.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

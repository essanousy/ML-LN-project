This is exactly why Lord Rimuru said we must be careful\u2026 Well, it\u2019s too late now. But don\u2019t blame me if he is furious about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What!? Beretta. Why are you pretending to be some goody two shoes that has nothing to do with this! You\u2019re our accomplice in crime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris frantically tried to implicate Beretta, but it would be hard to say that she succeeded.</p><br/><p>Beretta stayed calm and ignored her words.</p><br/><p>And just like Veldora, he began to look around and inspect this world they had come to.</p><br/><p>He understood that trying to argue with Ramiris seriously would only result in her putting the blame on him. And so Beretta decided to end it immediately.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh, fine. We\u2019ll talk about this later, when there\u2019s time,\u2019 Ramiris said, temporarily delaying her victory over Beretta.</p><br/><p>And it would indeed be temporary, for she had every intention of having Beretta take responsibility.</p><br/><p>It was done in the spirit of wanting to lessen the degree of anger directed towards her.</p><br/><p>Veldora was in total agreement concerning this, and so Beretta\u2019s position here was very dangerous.</p><br/><p>Honest people are not always rewarded for being honest.</p><br/><p>And as someone who had known Ramiris for a long time, Beretta had experienced this first-hand.</p><br/><p>Not only that, but the embodiment of irresponsible, Veldora, was also present.</p><br/><p>While Beretta\u2019s position was bad, he was able to buy some time.</p><br/><p>After that, he would just have to tell Rimuru what really happened and prove that he was not involved\u2014but then he realized that the situation was much more serious than he had thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad. We have lost any connection with our world. The Different Gate has closed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. After all, we used the ample energy available deep within the labyrinth, and that\u2019s what kept the magic circle working. So it only makes sense that it could not continue to stay up in this world, where there is no energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, master!? You sound very calm, but we will be able to get back, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, are you serious? Beretta. What\u2019s going on here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? This is because you ignored Lord Rimuru\u2019s warning and acted on your own\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta said with an exasperated shake of his head.</p><br/><p>Veldora looked away and whistled unconcernedly.</p><br/><p>He had actually expected the other world\u2019s energy to be enough in maintaining the gate.</p><br/><p>He had not expected this at all. That it would require energy on the other side as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! What! What! That makes it sound like it\u2019s all my fault!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Ramiris and Veldora\u2019s fault no matter what way you looked at it. And so it was a little horrifying that they weren\u2019t conscious of it.</p><br/><p>Or so Beretta thought, but he didn\u2019t waste his time voicing it.</p><br/><p>There were more important matters to deal with now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. What a predicament. Not only is there no energy, but the oxygen is also very thin. And there are places with some very serious pollution too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious? Now that I think of it, it is quite cold. And dark\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris now noticed it as well.</p><br/><p>The sky was covered in thick clouds, covering the sunlight.</p><br/><p>Because of this, the temperature on the ground was near freezing point.</p><br/><p>While they did not require oxygen and had a resistance to toxins, it still did not feel very nice.</p><br/><p>Besides\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hey? What if there are no people here, or life of any kind? I was looking forward to communicating with different cultures, but it doesn\u2019t look likely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris muttered with disappointment.</p><br/><p>There was no point in coming to other worlds if there was no life there.</p><br/><p>Still, it was possible they had just landed in a bad location, and she had not abandoned all hope just yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really bad. This world is a miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are \u2018hits\u2019 and \u2018misses\u2019 with worlds?\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Why wouldn\u2019t there be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. I told you. We came to look at other world cultures and try to search for something interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>I see. Beretta was satisfied.</p><br/><p>This place was polluted and the temperature was near the freezing point.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much hope of there being intelligent life here, and so Veldora and Ramiris\u2019s wish was not likely to come true.</p><br/><p>(I understand what they mean by \u2018miss.\u2019 However, to run such an operation alone and in secret\u2026perhaps they just wanted to discover a new civilization first and brag about it to Lord Rimuru\u2026 )</p><br/><p>Even as Beretta thought about this with exasperation, Veldora and Ramiris were having a conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I hate this. The cold aside, there isn\u2019t much spirit power here, which is weakening me. Besides, it\u2019s dark and all you can see in the distance is wild flatlands\u2026 It\u2019s, you know\u2026 Like those planets Rimuru knew about. Like Mars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh\u2026you know a lot, Ramiris. I was actually thinking the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.\u201cRight! Right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJudging from how polluted this place is, maybe there was a nuclear war here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhh! Very impressive master! You sure know a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKaaaha\u2014ahahahaha! Oh, you are exactly right about that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora and Ramiris continued their carefree conversation.</p><br/><p>As he listened to them, Beretta started to feel like it was stupid for him to think about this problem alone.</p><br/><p>Still, there were certain things he needed to ask them. And so he waited for them to calm down before asking Veldora.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Lord Veldora. Do you think it is possible for us to return?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora took a long pause and closed his eyes to think.</p><br/><p>Ramiris was also very interested in his answer, and so she waited quietly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

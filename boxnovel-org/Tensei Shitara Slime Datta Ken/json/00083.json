Eight-star demon lords</p><br/><p>The red haired demon lord stood up right after I devoured Clayman.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcellent, then from today onwards you will be acknowledged and known as a demon lord. Is there anyone who oppose of this? \u300d</p><br/><p>Naturally, there were no objections as apparently, I had already been accepted as a demon lord long before this.</p><br/><p>I was relieved. To be honest, when I antagonized another demon lord and had a quarrel I thought I would be a goner; It was a suicidal act!</p><br/><p>\u300cI believed that Rimuru was a guy that could get things done when needed to! If you like, I could allow you to be my follower. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I\u2019m good. Go find someone else to follow you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s with that!! What\u2019s wrong with following me?!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Begged Ramiris.</p><br/><p>On the other hand,</p><br/><p>\u300cFufun! You want to get along with Rimuru because he\u2019s my friend right? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh!? Lies! *Chokes*! Rimuru it\u2019s a lie right? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWahahahaha! You\u2019re so unpopular Ramiris! \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat was that \u30fc?! Hiya! \u300d</p><br/><p>Saying those words Ramiris performed a splendid flying kick towards Milim\u2019s face but Milim deftly avoided it.</p><br/><p>I stared at the two, amazed.</p><br/><p>\u300cFun. I don\u2019t want to admit, but there\u2019s no other way. This mistress will not forget her grudge against the evil dragon over there.</p><br/><p>But oh well, I\u2019ll admit it today. If you survive the next Great War, I\u2019ll play with you! \u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what Ruminas said.</p><br/><p>Since I was glared at with blood-thirsty eyes, I thought this bishojo was going to be a tough one, but it seems like everything\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe approve of this, don\u2019t we Old man (Dagruel)? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, yes we do indeed. I have nothing to oppose of this.\u300d</p><br/><p>TN Note: it\u2019s like \u201chm\u2026\u201d, but Japanese variant.</p><br/><p>Dino and Dagruel have also given their approval.</p><br/><p>The issue the two talked about must be something major. It seemed that they were trying to protect me a while ago, they\u2019re good guys.</p><br/><p>\u300cFu, I have no interest in regards to who being a demon lord or whatever. Do as you like. \u300d</p><br/><p>Leon said that, cold as usual.</p><br/><p>Now then, there\u2019s two individuals left.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I stared at Frey and Karion. Frey noticed my gaze and stared back at me as if she were sizing me up.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it fine? We\u2019re in the middle of the feast, and I\u2019d like to make a request rather than a suggestion but is it ok? \u300d</p><br/><p>And such words were spoken.</p><br/><p>Ruminas\u2019 butler had set the round table I kicked back in its original position.</p><br/><p>There was a large piece of table that broke, but I didn\u2019t look at it. If you pay attention to it you lose.</p><br/><p>It seems compensating for this round table is going to be pricy\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.</p><br/><p>The demon lords sat around the round table.</p><br/><p>During the meeting, two maids came in to prepare tea.</p><br/><p>Frey began to talk after everyone had calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst of all, there are no objections to accept the slime(Rimuru) as a demon lord.</p><br/><p>My proposal is another matter differing from the topic.</p><br/><p>\u2026no, it\u2019s not necessarily irrelevant.</p><br/><p>After watching the battle earlier, I was convinced-As a demon lord, I am too weak.</p><br/><p>Even when I was fighting Clayman, we\u2019re just neck to neck.</p><br/><p>If it were an aerial battle, I would have the advantage\u2026but this isn\u2019t an excuse for a demon lord.</p><br/><p>I have decided to become a subordinate of Milim.</p><br/><p>Milim is also very dangerous, not someone that should be left alone.</p><br/><p>I may be inferior as a demon lord, however my abilities in combat are decent.</p><br/><p>What do you think, will you accept my proposal? \u300d</p><br/><p>Saying this, Frey alternate gazes at Milim and Guy.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not about her being weak\u2026</p><br/><p>Rather, Clayman is the impulsive type, like a tactician. To think Frey would rely on tactics made them have a weird feeling in their gut.</p><br/><p>Well, I wonder is it because she\u2019s the scary female type that makes this even weirder.</p><br/><p>Just before Milim was able to respond to the proposal,</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a second. If that\u2019s the case, there are things I want to say as well.</p><br/><p>I too, had lost to Mirim due to my inflated ego.</p><br/><p>I intended to step down as the general.</p><br/><p>What if there is an emergency, or maybe the Hero appears? Giving this loser the name of a demon lord is presumptuous isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>That is why, starting from today I will be the subordinate of Milim.</p><br/><p>Pleased to meet you, General Milim!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment, they don\u2019t even bother to check the other party\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>Milim doesn\u2019t have any subordinates in the first place. That\u2019s why, there isn\u2019t anything stopping Milim getting subordinates\u2026</p><br/><p>This then makes me wonder, what will happen to the subordinates of the two Demon Lords?</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a minute, Karion! It was Claytard who was bad due to his negligence!</p><br/><p>I was controlled by him so I know about such things! \u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s probably unreasonable.</p><br/><p>While that excuse still wasn\u2019t accepted, I thought about Milim.</p><br/><p>The other demon lords have a surprised look on their face in response to that recklessness.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastards, don\u2019t feign ignorance and lecture others. A little while ago you were,</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s probably impossible for him to dominate me\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m good at breaking free from such things. \u300f</p><br/><p>Or something like that isn\u2019t it right? \u300d</p><br/><p>A good imitation of Milim\u2019s voice was used to re-deliver her lines.</p><br/><p>Guy is surprisingly skillful.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo! That, about that\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter what happens to that muscle brain idiot over there, you\u2019re fine right Milim? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTo, to have the audacity to say such a thing! When it comes to subordinates and servants, can you not speak to me so casually? Didn\u2019t we pull off the trick together as well!? \u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing Milim\u2019s words, his head shook,</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, if you want to, we can work together. After all, wouldn\u2019t it be more fun together? \u300d</p><br/><p>Thus, an instigation began.</p><br/><p>As you can see, this is a place where you can\u2019t afford to be careless.</p><br/><p>Well, Karion being Karion,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry about it, but you obliterated my country!</p><br/><p>You too, have the obligation to take care of us! \u300d</p><br/><p>Smoke began to rise from Milim as she tries to comprehend the difficult words.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s more of a schemer than I though.</p><br/><p>Milim who could no longer comprehend the meaning is now inches away from losing consciousness.</p><br/><p>Finally,</p><br/><p>\u300cEeeeiii!!! Whatever! Do as you like! \u300d</p><br/><p>The smoke that came out of her head was akin to a volcanic eruption, and she stopped thinking.</p><br/><p>As expected of Milim</p><br/><p>She looks clever, but she\u2019s no good at thinking.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha. All right! Then today onwards, Karion and Frey are no longer demon lords.</p><br/><p>You should have served Milim from the beginning\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy declares so with a laugh.</p><br/><p>Nobody present voiced an objection. Naturally, I too, have no objection.</p><br/><p>Thus, my Ascension as a demon lord has formally been approved.</p><br/><p>At the same time the three demon lords were expelled, one was given eternal death, and the other two are now direct subordinates of Milim.</p><br/><p>The Ten Great Demon Lords is currently down to The Eight Great Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, it\u2019s not the Ten Great Demon Lords anymore.\u300d</p><br/><p>In response to my murmuring, the demon lords reacted jumpily.</p><br/><p>\u300cDisturbing huh. For the sake of our dignity, we must think of a new name\u300d</p><br/><p>Dagruel had brought up such an issue.</p><br/><p>Eh? Is this such an important issue?</p><br/><p>\u300cFortunately, we\u2019re in the middle of the Walpurgis Banquet. All the demon lords are gathered here, so there is an abundance of wisdom floating about. \u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas made a serious Aizuchi.</p><br/><p>TN Note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizuchi</p><br/><p>Oyoy, it doesn\u2019t matter our name is.</p><br/><p>Besides, the humans already named us without our permission in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u300cDidn\u2019t the previous \u201cTen Great Demon Lords\u201d took about 3 months to decide? I\u2019m already burned out. I don\u2019t have any more energy to think~\u300d</p><br/><p>No no. You probably didn\u2019t think even before you burned out.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been thinking hard up till now! That\u2019s not what it looks like.</p><br/><p>Or rather, why did it take 3 months to think up such a name!</p><br/><p>Or rather, what I really want to say is\u2026demon lords seem to have a lot of free time\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>What I heard, is that during those 3 months the name \u201cTen Great Demon Lords\u201d had already taken root amongst the humans.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was decided to go with that name, but the needed assent weren\u2019t obtained.</p><br/><p>\u300cCalm down you lot. Its times like these where we need to cooperate and get over it! \u300d</p><br/><p>These are the words of Guy, and</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Eight Great\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>And, he silenced his surrounding with wordless, oppressive silence.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. Now, it\u2019s as Guy said! Give it your all everyone! \u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris restated this.</p><br/><p>Apparently not all eight great demon lords were convinced.</p><br/><p>And as if cooperation and coordination were meaningless,</p><br/><p>\u300cWahahahaha! I\u2019m leaving it all to you guys! \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI have no interest in this matter. I leave it to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Immediately, a few people had already started to interfere with the already fragmented cooperation between demon lords.</p><br/><p>As expected of demon lords.</p><br/><p>I thought it would be impossible to cooperate in the first place, and it seems like it really is.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, when the atmosphere was about to get even more awkward,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, if that\u2019s the case, then this is the specialty of my friend Rimuru! \u300d</p><br/><p>Behind my back Veldora had said such a thing when he began to get bored.</p><br/><p>Tsk, and I thought he would be fine as long as he keeps reading manga when such an event occurs.</p><br/><p>Reading the mood, he indifferently continues reading on his own.</p><br/><p>However, there was someone who nodded in response to Veldora\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat reminds me, it was you who named my subordinate (butler)! \u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s Ramiris</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even your servant\u201d is what I wanted to say, but now\u2019s not the time for this.</p><br/><p>But this person\u2026 I caught a glimpse of her intentions showing, only to disappear right after.</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t insert the interlocking nails, it\u2019ll soon be too late.</p><br/><p>TN Note: Interlocking nails are iron rods stabbed into bones to straighten them.</p><br/><p>Well, I don\u2019t really mind\u2026but it\u2019s up to Baretta\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>Looking around, the demon lord\u2019s expectation-filled gazes are now all focused on me.</p><br/><p>Oh no\u2026 the encircling net has already been cast.</p><br/><p>Winking to each other, Guy said,</p><br/><p>\u300cToday, Rimuru has been recognized as a new Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>I think I would like to give you a wonderful privilege.</p><br/><p>Yes! The privilege to give us a new name!</p><br/><p>Receiving such a great honor, you will naturally accept it, will you not? \u300d</p><br/><p>This is, a wheedling voice.</p><br/><p>And I remained silent, neither accepting nor rejecting,</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd besides, you are the reason why our numbers decreased. Take responsibility and think of a name already! \u300d</p><br/><p>Suddenly out came an intimidating tone.</p><br/><p>This is going to be seriously troublesome.</p><br/><p>Whatever. I give up too.</p><br/><p>\u300cI get it already. Goodness sake, don\u2019t complain if you don\u2019t like the name. \u300d</p><br/><p>I replied thus.</p><br/><p>The demon lords, now at ease with their face filled with smiles.</p><br/><p>They relax while I substitute them in a tea ceremony. Completely leaving it to others.</p><br/><p>TN Note: I think the tea ceremony is an idiom about leaving all the hard work to others.</p><br/><p>Well then, this guy has high standing.</p><br/><p>There are eight demon lords, Eight Great Demon Lords is probably fine, but I have a feeling this wouldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>Earlier, Ramiris think Eight Great Demon Lords is fine right? I was about to say it, but the intimidating glares from my surroundings made me forget all about it.</p><br/><p>Rejected.</p><br/><p>Now what\u2026,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about \u201cEight-Star Demon lords\u201d? Even though I associated it with an Octagram? \u300d</p><br/><p>[ED: I tried to think of new names for them, and ended up with these:</p><br/><p>Octostar Demon Lord,</p><br/><p>Starry eight Demon Lord,</p><br/><p>Eighth starred Demon Lord,</p><br/><p>and my personal favourite, Octo-Dimensional star Demon Lord</p><br/><p>None made it to the end.]</p><br/><p>After I spoke, silence followed.</p><br/><p>The Demon lords closed their eyes, and examined each word carefully.</p><br/><p>After a while, everyone opened their eyes in unison, and,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s decided. A splendid name\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t think you have won yet, a new era is upon us! \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI thought so! If it\u2019s Rimiru I believed he/it/she can do it! \u300d</p><br/><p>ED: Rimuru you damn hermaphrodite. Making my life so hard.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected indeed! Bwahahaha!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph, I\u2019ll acknowledge this, just a little.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn an instant! Wow. The last one took three months! \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t any objections.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s great.</p><br/><p>Even if anyone objects, I\u2019m going to make that person think of a name instead.</p><br/><p>and besides, I just heard it. What have you lot been doing in those three months\u2026</p><br/><p>In this fashion\u2026from today onwards, the feared demon lords will be known as the \u201cEight Star Demon Lords\u201d (Octagram)</p><br/><p>Eight Star Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>Demon race\u2026 The \u201cLord of Darkness\u201d Guy Crimson.</p><br/><p>Dragonoid race\u2026 The \u201cTyrant of Destruction\u201d Milim Nava.</p><br/><p>Pixie race\u2026The \u201cFairy of the labyrinth\u201d Ramiris-chan.</p><br/><p>Giant race\u2026 The \u201cContinent\u2019s Wrath\u201d Dagruel.</p><br/><p>Vampire\u2026 The \u201cQueen of Nightmares\u201d Ruminas Valentine.</p><br/><p>Fallen race\u2026 The \u201cSleeping Ruler\u201d Dino.</p><br/><p>Humanoid Demon race\u2026 The \u201cBlonde devil\u201d Leon Cromwell.</p><br/><p>And I,</p><br/><p>Slime race\u2026 The \u201cNewbie\u201d Rimuru Tempest.</p><br/><p>I want a cool \u201cSecond name\u201d too.</p><br/><p>To make my soul tremble in excitement, they\u2019re wonderful guys.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s someone inside who will think whatever.</p><br/><p>With my recognition as a demon lord, the distribution of land was also carried out.</p><br/><p>Currently, my territory consists of the entirety of the Great Jura Forest.</p><br/><p>It was an unprecedented treatment.</p><br/><p>Frey\u2019s, Karion\u2019s, as well as Clayman\u2019s territory will be merged and be under the rule of Milim.</p><br/><p>In the end, her rule is nominal.</p><br/><p>Territory management will probably be left to Karion and Frey, as well as Milim\u2019s people.</p><br/><p>Because there are some drifters amongst the demon lords, hiding in their territory, so I don\u2019t know the locations of all the rulers.</p><br/><p>However, with the demon lord\u2019s ring, it is possible to communicate with them.</p><br/><p>I was also given one.</p><br/><p>The Demon lord\u2019s ring can not only be used for communication, but also summons a spatial magic gate.</p><br/><p>Of course, they can freely visit this place\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s about it, which means I can come here without needing them to exclusively come pick me up\u2026?</p><br/><p>No, I can\u2019t think about this. I have a feeling I\u2019m only going to feel tiresome if I ask this.</p><br/><p>Thus, the series of events involving Clayman as the mastermind has come to a close, and I was recognized as the new demon lord.</p><br/><p>Clayman\u2019s master, the existence of this mastermind is worrisome, but at the moment the issues from the demon side are resolved.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, I have officially stepped up to the position as the demon lord.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Guy had a thin smile on his face as he observed the demon lords.</p><br/><p>Now, the demon lords have received a new name as well as a slight increase in combat power.</p><br/><p>Eight-star Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>A symbol of the new demon lords, I think it\u2019s a splendid name.</p><br/><p>The distribution of forces is settled and everything has settled into a state of equilibrium.</p><br/><p>In the Great War this time, it is certain that he has the advantage.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no difference whether he wins or loses, but even so it is natural for him to desire winning.</p><br/><p>While it lies in his degree of familiarity\u2026</p><br/><p>According to what Dino heard, the eastern empire is rapidly gathering forces.</p><br/><p>The troops that was once destroyed by Veldora has begun to regroup and powerful beings are reborn once more.</p><br/><p>And, we suspect that within the shadows of the eastern empire lies the presence of the \u201cscorching dragon\u201d, Velgurind.</p><br/><p>If the empire starts making a move, the \u201cdragon kind\u201d may start getting active.</p><br/><p>Things have become interesting.</p><br/><p>The pieces have been scattered on the world as the stage, the war (game) for supremacy.</p><br/><p>The challengers will give their all and participate in this fight.</p><br/><p>A way to finally relieve this boredom after 500 years.</p><br/><p>This time\u2019s Great War is going to be something truly \u201cgreat\u201d.</p><br/><p>My own ultimate skill, \u300ePrideful King Lucifer\u300f.</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s ultimate skill, \u300eWrathful King Satan\u300f</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>The New demon lord Rimuru\u2019s ultimate skill, \u300eGluttonous King Beelzebub\u300fis taken into consideration.</p><br/><p>Three major powers with the strongest abilities, the ultimate skills, are prepared.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think I am the stronger one here, but I hope it\u2019s a happy miscalculation.</p><br/><p>In addition,</p><br/><p>Within Dino, \u201cSloth\u201d.</p><br/><p>Within Ruminas, \u201cLust\u201d.</p><br/><p>The priority of awakening of the two\u2019s ultimate ability is only placed in the back.</p><br/><p>And, to enjoy things\u2026</p><br/><p>About Shion\u2026 She already has combat abilities on par with the demon lords, and further growth can be expected form her.</p><br/><p>TN Note: Except she used her blessing on cooking.

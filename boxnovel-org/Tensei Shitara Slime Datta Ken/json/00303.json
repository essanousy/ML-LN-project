That was the conclusion the research team came to.</p><br/><p>And if they were right, then these Arch Demons were nothing to fear.</p><br/><p>After all, all they would have to do was to call them once by partially summoning them. Once they confirmed whether or not it had a will, they could just send it back if it looked too dangerous.</p><br/><p>Through these experiments, they became very adept at controlling demons.</p><br/><p>Once they had the data, they had no use for the captured demons.</p><br/><p>Godama had decided that there was no more need for experiments, and he had the demons exterminated.</p><br/><p>And it was the Destroyers that were the most useful for doing this.</p><br/><p>The most powerful golems that hunted down demons.</p><br/><p>Godama was very proud of their power.</p><br/><p>And he had thirteen of these reliable Destroyers, which meant that Diabo\u2019s death was a definite thing\u2013In any case, Godama believed this without doubt.</p><br/><p>And so Godama thought:</p><br/><p>They said he was the leader of the Great Demon Lord\u2019s 12 Guardians. But it was absurd. He was just a demon, and everything else had been rumor.</p><br/><p>However, this has great meaning.</p><br/><p>Diablo was a demon who was called the right hand of the slime. Killing him would mean cutting off a huge portion of the Great Demon Lord\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>In that case\u2026</p><br/><p>It is not too unlikely that because of my contributions, I will become the leader of the Humanity Emancipation Alliance. That is what this means.</p><br/><p>I will lead them to a new world!</p><br/><p>Still, it had been so incredibly easy to trap him.</p><br/><p>His eyes had been full of the confidence of the strong.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why a wise man like me was able to easily lead him, just like taking the hand of a baby.</p><br/><p>He had used the pitfall before in dealing with the Accommodationists, in other words, those who were in favor of recognizing the Great Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>It had gone much better than expected, and Godama remembered just how surprised he had been.</p><br/><p>It was the same this time as well.</p><br/><p>The feared demon who was known by all, Diablo.</p><br/><p>But the truth was that he was weaker than even an Arch Demon.</p><br/><p>Godama laughed at this idea.</p><br/><p>It was a common thing though, where rumors ran wild but the truth was most disappointing.</p><br/><p>He was intelligent, and was able to have a physical body in this world while having 7,000 in energy, which made him a threat.</p><br/><p>But that was all nothing now.</p><br/><p>Godama was only thinking about his own future. He was drunk on fantasies of fame and glory.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow silly it all is. I had heard that the Royal Knights that protected the emperor were no match for the Great Demon Lord\u2019s 12 Guardians\u2026but now we know that that story was false. Even I would not have chosen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? The 12 Guardians are not so weak, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. What are you saying? I just finished taking care of their leader, Diablo. With my own hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that is impressive. Well then, who are you talking to right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godama had been so absorbed in his own bliss, that it took him a moment to feel that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>He had made sure that no one would disturb him in this room. And so no one should be here but him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice came from behind him, and so Godama frantically turned around.</p><br/><p>The person who was standing there was a beautiful demon with eyes that burned bright like fire.</p><br/><p>The person who would throw Godama into the pits of despair.</p><br/><p>\u2013It was Diablo.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

Turns out I am perfectly fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godama heard those words and was finally able to speak again.</p><br/><p>While still in shock, he shouted at Diablo.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt cannot be! Bastard. How did you escape my Destroyers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Godama\u2019s brain started to function again.</p><br/><p>His brain was finally able to understand who this person in front of him was.</p><br/><p>\u201cGaaahhh!! Are yo-you really Diablo\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>His brain had tried to persuade him that this was not the case, but his brain had failed.</p><br/><p>Godama\u2019s face filled with panic and fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe. Those golems were very entertaining. I was almost sorry that I had to break them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo-how?! How did you break them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo tilted his head to the side as if he did not understand the meaning of the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act dumb! You could not use magic. You had no power to use\u2026 And yet, how did you\u2026?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>Diablo nodded.</p><br/><p>He knew now why Godama had been so surprised. And so he decided to be magnanimous and explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be obvious. If I can\u2019t use magic, then I just have to fight physically. What don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo answered as if it were the most obvious thing.</p><br/><p>However, Godama was not satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense! Those were Destroyers! Just one of them are capable of defeating an Arch Demon, and there were thirteen of them!! And you\u2026you could not have beaten them without magic!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was screaming now.</p><br/><p>Godama\u2019s brain was telling him that it was impossible. And he would not believe Diablo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>As for Diablo, he smiled gently at Godama.</p><br/><p>He wanted to show respect to someone who had so triggered his emotions. And while it was rare for Diablo, he decided to spend time to talk to him.</p><br/><p>Either that, or Diablo had been so angry that he had started to grow numb\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it wasn\u2019t exactly easy. I was barehanded against those heavyweights, after all. However! That\u2019s when I had an idea. Lord Rimuru had once said that \u2018willows are weak, yet they bind other wood.\u2019 And so I decided to take advantage of the opportunity and calm myself down while fighting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo explained.</p><br/><p>However, while Diablo may intended to follow Rimuru\u2019s words, the truth was different.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

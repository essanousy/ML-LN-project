The bottom zone was extremely hard.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, it went well until the 50th floor.</p><br/><p>But, after the 55th floor, Death Knights were roaming together in a platoon.</p><br/><p>I think this would be hard for ordinary knight ranks.</p><br/><p>Well, the problem started from the 59th floor though.]</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015That was dangerous\u300d</p><br/><p>They began to speak vigorously.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because they were excited, they didn\u2019t mind how theylooked anymore.</p><br/><p>If you saw the three\u2019s clothes, the ripped chain mail was broken in some parts.</p><br/><p>Just by looking at it there was no doubt that it was due to a fierce battle.</p><br/><p>The story of the three continued.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe boss of that floor was a Commander rank Death Knight\u2015\u2015Death Lord\u2015\u2015 but,</p><br/><p>three of them appeared at the same time, you know!</p><br/><p>Moreover, they were accompanied by 5 Death Knights each, you see?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat was horrible...maybe, we were relaxed until the 50th floor\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe boss monster with a cow-like face had a strength comparable to an A rank.</p><br/><p>Anyway, to have such monsters guarding it, there seems to be something in that labyrinth\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHee...then, did you guys give up at the 59th floor?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, we somehow managed to defeated the three sets of Death Knights and their commanders.</p><br/><p>But well......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe guardian of the 60th floor seems to be a named boss, it was absurdly strong, you know\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause we were almost defeated by the numbers on the 59th floor, we were already prepared for a battle of attrition on the 60th floor though...\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe result was our defeat by a single humanoid type monster\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt clearly had abnormal strength, to the point of being the superior version of a Death Knight\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015That was, impossible. Even if we try it many times, we will lose\u300d</p><br/><p>When the three talked to such an extent, Yuuki sat on a chair, and settled down a bit.</p><br/><p>He drunk the served tea, and took a breath.</p><br/><p>Yuuki, thought that,to some degree,his expectation was correct,</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, there seemed to be something over there?\u300d</p><br/><p>He questioned the exhausted trio.</p><br/><p>Apparently, the three seemed to have just left the town by foot after being defeated at the 60th floor.</p><br/><p>They regrouped with Damrada, who waited at the outskirts of the town, and immediately returned with Transfer Magic.</p><br/><p>This was because they feared a pursuit.</p><br/><p>They heard that the highest record for the labyrinth was the 39th floor and there seemed to be a stalemate against the waiting boss of the 40th floor before they had challenged it.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, they thought that they certainly stood out by advancing and establishing new recordsright off the bat.</p><br/><p>They said that they realized their mission had failed, and they withdrew when they confirmed existence of strong individual guarding the place without re-challenging the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>After some considering they,</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no doubt. There should be some kind of facility beyond that place.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe size of the labyrinth was quite something.</p><br/><p>I think it was expanded through some kind of magic though, but it didn\u2019t seem to be an artificial structure.</p><br/><p>In the first place, that place didn\u2019t seem to have something like underground ruins originally, either.</p><br/><p>In that case, it was a mystery how they secured a place that wide.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Only in that floor, the defense was abnormally severe.</p><br/><p>No matter how you lookat it, they\u2019re guarding something.</p><br/><p>Not only the knight that defeated us, there was a skeleton magician, and ghost dragon later on.</p><br/><p>I think that the forces there were very different than on the other floors\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight.</p><br/><p>You could laugh but\u2026</p><br/><p>Probably, if all the monsters up to the 59th floor fought against the monster of the 60th floor\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Those guys from the 60th floor would win.\u300d</p><br/><p>Shinji and Zhen nodded in agreement with Mark\u2019s thought.</p><br/><p>They say that it had such an overwhelming presence.</p><br/><p>Yuuki had no doubt that the floors until the 50th floor were originally the labyrinth sections for tourist attraction purposes, while the 51st to the 60th floors and further, were a restricted secure area.</p><br/><p>After that, they ate a light meal, and he received the report in calm, eased state.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem that they were able to enter Tempest, but they seemed to have been able to gather information from the openhearted adventurers in the labyrinth town.</p><br/><p>They summarized such information, and reported it.</p><br/><p>As well as all sorts of thing they had obtained,their spoils of war.</p><br/><p>They got a high quality \u201cMagic Crystal\u201d from a monster.</p><br/><p>They were able to get some quality equipment from the treasure chest, which could be located in a room inside the labyrinth, or from the floor boss, and so on.</p><br/><p>Each one of them were rare class, while the bardiche that Mark had was unique class.</p><br/><p>They could sense,that to gather so many people, they needed to set up an unthinkable amount of money and labor.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, there was some worrying information.</p><br/><p>That is,</p><br/><p>Therewas a city on a certain floor inside the dungeon (Underground Labyrinth).</p><br/><p>Or so they say.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a mistake.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. I think it must be.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015It is.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe point though, is that we cannot passed the 60th floor.\u300d</p><br/><p>At least, because he judged it to be absolutely impossible with only his group, Shinji reported it obediently.</p><br/><p>It was on a level that saving face was of no use, since the boss was just too strong.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell by the way, to what extent did you feel that boss\u2019s strength?</p><br/><p>Can you compare it with people that belong to the Imperial Guard Army to be specific?\u300d</p><br/><p>Shinji and the two were lost in thought at Yuuki\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Though it was called the Imperial Guard Army, in the army there were people like Shinji and his group, who weren\u2019t interested in the Rank Deciding Battle.</p><br/><p>They were indebted to Yuuki in various ways after they had come to this world, and had helped under his instructions in various ways\u2026</p><br/><p>Since they were not interested in being in the top 100, they didn\u2019t participate in the Rank Deciding Battle seriously either.</p><br/><p>Furthermore,since the Corps Commander had been replaced by Yuuki, they had purposefully transferred from their original Armored Corps to the Mixed Army Corps that Yuuki led as Corps Commander.</p><br/><p>In this corps, there was no need to participate in the useless Rank Deciding Battle.</p><br/><p>There wasa number of people that existed among them that thought like \u201cOtherworlders\u201d.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t given a large responsibility, and they didn\u2019t show off their power, they were people that lived suitably.</p><br/><p>Because the abilities of such people were not clear, it was a mystery whether the Imperial Guard Army was really the strongest group though\u2026</p><br/><p>But, on paper, there was no mistake that this group was the strongest group in the Empire.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell\u2026At least, around the top 50th rank...?</p><br/><p>I think those guys\u2019 subordinate aren\u2019t worth considering\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn the end, it was just that one knight, right?</p><br/><p>That knight, we weren\u2019t able to touch him, even with the three of us, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Right. People in the top 30th rank, might fight evenly against the knight?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhich reminds me...Wasn\u2019t there an Arc Demon subjugation troop dispatched before the construction?</p><br/><p>That time, I participated as the campaign\u2019s doctor...\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, the \u201cLake Shore Dyed in Scarlet\u201d incident[1]? Is it true, Shinji was a survivor of that incident?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015 I was lucky to survive\u300d</p><br/><p>The \u201cLake Shore Dyed in Scarlet\u201d incident was one of abominable incidents that had occurred in the Empire territory.</p><br/><p>A vassal state, adjacent to the beautiful lake, revolted against the empire, and shouted for independence. That time, the king of that vassal state took a certain measure, since his state was inferior in war forces to Empire.</p><br/><p>That was, the secret art of Demon Summoning,which could be considered Taboo.</p><br/><p>The king gave an order to summon the strongest demon thatwould obey him, and the Imperial Court Magician answered the order.</p><br/><p>Even if they opposed the empire, that small country population didn\u2019t even reach 10,000 people, so there\u2019s should be no chances of victory for them, but\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>There was a reason why the king suddenly declared his country\u2019s independence.</p><br/><p>A noble from the Empire desired for the princess, his only daughter.</p><br/><p>In the Empire, which had become powerful, it was impossible for the emperor to grasp the movementsof such a small country.</p><br/><p>The margrave, who was entrusted to rule the area, borrowed the emperor\u2019s authority, and performed atrocities. Such a spectacle was a common occurrence in the Empire.</p><br/><p>The Arc Demon appeared from the Demon Summoning;then destroyed that small country.</p><br/><p>The demon\u2019s desire was that kingdom\u2019s princess.</p><br/><p>The Imperial Court Magician, whose mind began to break the instant he saw the demon, presented the princess in response to the demon\u2019s demand.</p><br/><p>The demon sprouted a wicked smile, and possessed the princess\u2019 body.</p><br/><p>It accomplished embodiment through the princess.[2]</p><br/><p>The King went into a rage. However, that anger was immediately replaced by fear as the demon\u2019s rampage began.</p><br/><p>In the end, a report that the small countrywas destroyed reached the Empire, and the demon\u2019s subjugation was decided.</p><br/><p>As if their initial response was late by a step, that place would become the location where the second Guy Crimson was born.</p><br/><p>The beautiful lake was dyed with the blood of that small country\u2019s populace, and the water change into a red color.</p><br/><p>Even in the several hundred years of the Empire\u2019s history, this detestable incident could be called the worst that had ever happened.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, about the main issue in hand.</p><br/><p>I only saw its appearance during the fight at that time though,</p><br/><p>I felt the 60th floor boss was about the same as the Arc Demon\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? Such thing as anArc Demon! It\u2019s on a level that we can\u2019t defeat, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Is it really, the same?\u300d</p><br/><p>The Armored Corps, which had branches throughout the entirety of the Empire\u2019s territory, solved the \u201cLake Shore Dyed in Scarlet\u201d incident.</p><br/><p>Or so it was the official story.</p><br/><p>However, Shinji who was there, saw that a few knights defeated the Arc Demon, which the troops couldn\u2019t fight, from afar.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t intend to mention it, but he thought that they were probably people who belonged to the Imperial Guard Army now.</p><br/><p>Therefore, because of it,he had lost his interest in the Rank Deciding Battle.</p><br/><p>He really felt that they lived in a different world.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, they might be like this.</p><br/><p>It would be great if a machine to check the enemy\u2019s power can be developed, though it would probably have no significance.</p><br/><p>That knight seemed to be strong since he was a high level swordsman.</p><br/><p>The later magician-like skeleton had an intimidating air that was comparable to an Arc Demon.\u300d</p><br/><p>Shinji\u2019s words didn\u2019t contain doubt, and were full of his true feelings.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, it can\u2019t be helped that we lost.</p><br/><p>In addition to those powerful two, there was a dragon right?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a bit too cruel. The balance is too difficult, that labyrinth.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUntil the 50th floor the balance was good though\u2026</p><br/><p>As expected, if you consider what lies on the other side, there must be a town after that place.\u300d</p><br/><p>Receiving the three\u2019s report, Yuuki pondered.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an accurate conclusion,since he didn\u2019t see it with his own eyes, but as there seemed to be a floor that was guarded by an undead transformed dragon, and two beings with an Arc Demon class.</p><br/><p>It seemed they couldn\u2019t reach the targeted research facilities if they didn\u2019tpass that place.</p><br/><p>(Oh well, it can\u2019t be dealt with with ordinary means, as expected)</p><br/><p>Yuuki could go and breakthrough the labyrinth himself, but he would be noticed immediately by Rimuru and his group.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t participate in the labyrinth simply because they were cautious about his movements.</p><br/><p>However, Yuuki wanted to achieve the goal of the labyrinth\u2019s capture somehow. He may ignore it, but Yuuki had a hunch that some problemsweregoing to occur later.</p><br/><p>Yuuki pondered for a while,</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you, you guys should have a good rest.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, if you want to examine the obtained equipment in detail,</p><br/><p>you guys should visit the Imperial Court Magician, Gadra-roushi[3].</p><br/><p>Shinji, you should greet your master for the first time in a while as well, right?</p><br/><p>Also, you guys may sell the unnecessary things, since the Supplies Section will purchase it.\u300d</p><br/><p>He thanked the three people, and called out to them.</p><br/><p>The three, who remembered that they were tired withhis words, showed delighted expressions, thanked Yuuki, and left the room.</p><br/><p>The seeds were scattered.</p><br/><p>It might have been too early to spread this matter to the other sections.</p><br/><p>Probably, the Empire would move.</p><br/><p>Yuuki thought as much, and quietly sprouted a smile.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>After the three left Yuuki\u2019s room, they went to the Supplies Section to sell \u201cMagic Crystals\u201d and unused equipment.</p><br/><p>Their reconnaissance ended in failure, but they were able to get a considerable income in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>Their salaries, provided by the army,were more than the average income of a commoner, but not to the extent where they could live luxuriously. On the other hand, to leave the army and become independent, the conditions in this world were very severe.</p><br/><p>Being able to live a steady life, was already attractive.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, hey, where did you guys obtain this \u201cMagic Crystal\u201d?</p><br/><p>This is something hardly seen recently, isn\u2019t this a high quality one!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe equipment here is great too. It\u2019s a weapon made with pure Demon Steel.</p><br/><p> Though I\u2019m bothered by this hole thing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, where it was obtained is a secret. Please don\u2019t ask again.\u300d</p><br/><p>After having such an exchange, they had a good rest in their respective rooms that day.</p><br/><p>The forced march had ended, their bodies, and minds might have been dead tired. When Shinji woke up, it was the evening of the next day.</p><br/><p>Shinji who woke up, contacted the other two.</p><br/><p>Zhen was up, but it seemed like Mark was still sleeping.</p><br/><p>Actually, his fatigue would be great for sure, since Mark mostly played an active role.</p><br/><p>The three met, and decided to have dinner.</p><br/><p>In the Empire\u2019s capital, the three had a meal at a high class restaurant.</p><br/><p>It had been a while since they had last has such a luxury.</p><br/><p>Yuuki didn\u2019t tell them to hand over the spoils, and was happy to give everything to Shinji and his colleagues.</p><br/><p>When permission to plunder is not given, the spoils obtained in the middle of a military campaign belonged to the military.</p><br/><p>In this case, they couldn\u2019t complain, even in the worst case where everything was taken away.</p><br/><p>Well in most cases,</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, if all things and money obtained were taken away, we might seriously think about migrating away right?\u300d</p><br/><p>The two agreed with Shinji\u2019s remark.</p><br/><p>One gold coin was equivalent to 100,000 yen.</p><br/><p>The market price was similar in the Empire.</p><br/><p>The gold coins in the market were issued by the Dwarf Kingdom, the quality was standardized as the common gold coin.</p><br/><p>They could use the original Empire gold coin, but there would be an inspection of the money by the moneychanger, and the fee was larger too.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the majority of transactions were using the gold coins made by the Dwarf Kingdom.</p><br/><p>The gold coins made by the Dwarf Kingdom were inscribed with magic, any counterfeit money would be exposed immediately. If by chance, a counterfeit was exposed, it would result with a death penalty.</p><br/><p>Because of that, there were only a few idiots that counterfeited money in the present.</p><br/><p>The gold coins that Shinji\u2019s group obtained from the labyrinth city,which was the satellite city of the Monster\u2019s Country Tempest,were without doubt made by the Dwarf Kingdom.</p><br/><p>It could be used inside the Empire without any problems.</p><br/><p>The army had an annual salary system. The promotion was also included, calculated and collected the next year.</p><br/><p>However, taking in consideration the people who didn\u2019t have the money on hand,they had devised a system where they gave out daily allowances from the reserve funds.</p><br/><p>For an ordinary soldier, it was ten gold coins\u2015\u2015their annual salary was equivalent to 1 million yen.</p><br/><p>Because the army took care of the life necessities (food, clothing &amp; shelter), it was a large sum of money for poor people.</p><br/><p>The gold coins that they obtained were altogether more than 100 pieces.</p><br/><p>Mark and Zhen\u2019s rank were First Lieutenant.</p><br/><p>Because Shinji had the qualification as an army doctor, his command right was two ranks higher, he was a Major.</p><br/><p>Because Otherworlders are given preferential treatment, even at the lowest they will receive treatment as Second Lieutenants.</p><br/><p>Of course, the salary provided by the Empire in a year was more than for an ordinary soldier.</p><br/><p>But, even so it was around 50~100 pieces of gold coins.</p><br/><p>The amount of money they had earned during this short-term mission was greater than their annual salaries.</p><br/><p>Not to mention that the unique class equipment and so such, were things that they couldn\u2019t get throughout their lifetimes unless they paid hefty sums for it.</p><br/><p>Being unable to stomach Damrada\u2019s lavish lifestyle was the biggest reason Mark hated him.</p><br/><p>In short it was jealousy, there was no other meaning.</p><br/><p>Mark didn\u2019t like Damrada, whom he didn\u2019t know, who was just living a good life, while he, himself, was personally just a dog of the army.</p><br/><p>In addition, he was disgusted with himself, who thought about such things, and took out his anger more strongly on Damrada.</p><br/><p>Shinji could understand Mark\u2019s feelings, but he could satisfy himself with only the salary he received as an army doctor.</p><br/><p>If he said something careless word, it would disturb Mark\u2019s mood.</p><br/><p>They were thinking about something based off the information that they were able to get in this mission.</p><br/><p>That,</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if they didn\u2019t particularly cling to the military, the three of them could live together in the labyrinth city, couldn\u2019t they?\u2019</p><br/><p>Was something like that.</p><br/><p>Sure, the Empire was the leading force in culture and technology. It was an excellent capital.</p><br/><p>The food was delicious, and the living conditions were comfortable too.</p><br/><p>As long as they had money, they were able to enjoy a fulfilling life comparable to their former world.</p><br/><p>But, they were more or less civil employees.</p><br/><p>They might be given a dangerous mission, and so they couldn\u2019t be careless.</p><br/><p>In that regard, that dungeon was very satisfying.</p><br/><p>After all, they didn\u2019t have to worry about dying.</p><br/><p>They were half in doubt, but because they had experienced it themselves, they had no choice but to believe it.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t have to worry about dying, wasn\u2019t it better for them to live interestingly over there?</p><br/><p>It was normal to think so.</p><br/><p>Even if there was money, there was no meaning in it if there was no entertainment\u2026</p><br/><p>Over there, there was a place called the Colosseum, and it seemed it could be used freely on its day off.</p><br/><p>Various sports games, like soccer and baseball, were played over there, and they had already investigated that the adventurer citizens enjoyed it.</p><br/><p>About the taste of the food, it was equal to empire.</p><br/><p>Though it was equal, it hada nostalgic taste that couldn\u2019t be reproduced by the people of this world, and it attracted their hearts as people from Earth.</p><br/><p>To be frank, it was because theywereindebted to Yuuki that they didn\u2019t have feel like to changing sides.</p><br/><p>When the war begun, they would be considered deserters, but fortunately right now was a peaceful time.</p><br/><p>If it was now, it would be easy to retire from duty, and leave the army.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe problem is the war\u2026right\u300d</p><br/><p>Mark muttered.</p><br/><p>It was the reason they couldn\u2019t decide.</p><br/><p>That was caused by the problem he just stated.</p><br/><p>War would certainly begin. Otherwise, they would have left this country long ago, and would have moved to the labyrinth city.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhich side do you think will win?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJust saying, what will we do if we receive an order to attack that city?\u300d</p><br/><p>The three looked at each other.</p><br/><p>There was a feeling of unpleasantness in attacking that city they liked, right after they had stayed there for a while.

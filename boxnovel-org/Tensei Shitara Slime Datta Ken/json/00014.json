It appeared that</p><br/><p>the right hand side was a pathway for the likes of nobles and important</p><br/><p>figures.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I assumed as I observed my surroundings while lining up on</p><br/><p>the left side.</p><br/><p>While waiting, I saw that there was a varied treatment of the people, such</p><br/><p>as those who received a free pass, while others would be taken into a</p><br/><p>separate room to be checked.</p><br/><p>Befitting of a military nation, the guards took a firmly defensive stance.</p><br/><p>Although it seemed that you were comparatively free to act when you get</p><br/><p>inside\u2026.</p><br/><p>Still, the line was incredibly long. It might be that we would spend more</p><br/><p>time here waiting than we did traveling\u2026!</p><br/><p>But at the moment I was thinking that,</p><br/><p>[Oi oi! There\u2019s demons in a place like this! We\u2019re still not inside, so isn\u2019t it</p><br/><p>fine to kill them here?]</p><br/><p>[Hey, what are you doing lining up there? You guys are damn cheeky. If</p><br/><p>you don\u2019t want to die, give me that spot!</p><br/><p>Also, leave everything you have behind. And then I\u2019ll let you go this</p><br/><p>time!!!]</p><br/><p>Those were really quite the dubious statements..</p><br/><p>Actually, I think that voice full of ill intent was aimed towards us.</p><br/><p>Over here, there was no one but me and Gobuta-kun.</p><br/><p>In any case, taking along a group wearing only loincloths does make you</p><br/><p>stand out in a bad way.</p><br/><p>Rigur had also wanted to come, but I refused.</p><br/><p>The other group was camping at the entrance of the forest, waiting for our</p><br/><p>return.</p><br/><p>And that was why it was just us two, but I wonder if we looked like easy</p><br/><p>targets?</p><br/><p>It seemed that a pair of adventurers that didn\u2019t want to get in line had their</p><br/><p>eyes on us.</p><br/><p>[Oi oi, Gobuta-kun, do you hear something?]</p><br/><p>[Yes, I can hear it too\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Did you get caught up in something like this the last time you came?]</p><br/><p>[Of course! I was beaten black and blue, then I got picked up by a group of</p><br/><p>kobold merchants!</p><br/><p>If they hadn\u2019t found me, I think I might have died back then~]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 So you did get involved. Well then, can nothing be done about it?]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s something like the fate of weak demons\u2026]</p><br/><p>It looked like we were in trouble. Moreover, this was a considered a</p><br/><p>normal occurrence here\u2026</p><br/><p>I wished I\u2019d known sooner.</p><br/><p>As if he had realized my thoughts, Gobuta-kun was hanging his head.</p><br/><p>I had finally gotten him to talk normally with me, but would this one time</p><br/><p>mistake return him to his previous nervousness?</p><br/><p>I was a little worried.</p><br/><p>[Oi! Even though you\u2019re nothing but a small fry. Don\u2019t be ignoring me</p><br/><p>now!]</p><br/><p>[Rather than that, isn\u2019t a talking slime rare? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019ll be</p><br/><p>popular in an exhibit?]</p><br/><p>The two continued making their annoying conversation.</p><br/><p>I vaguely felt like I\u2019ve been told at one time that I had a Buddha-like deep</p><br/><p>compassion\u2026but this was making me angry.</p><br/><p>[Gobuta-kun\u2026. Do you remember the rules I said before?]</p><br/><p>[Yes! Of course!]</p><br/><p>[I see. Well then, for a while, I want you to close your eyes and plug your</p><br/><p>ears! You must not ever look this way!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026? I don\u2019t really understand, but roger that!]</p><br/><p>Now let\u2019s see. I was the one who made the rules, yet I would be breaking</p><br/><p>them first\u2026</p><br/><p>If my group came to know of this, it would be bad from an educational</p><br/><p>standpoint.</p><br/><p>Since I made sure that Gobuta-kun, who was in the way, closed his eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>let\u2019s begin clearing the trash!</p><br/><p>At that moment, the man on my right shifted his line of sight.</p><br/><p>Further checking my surroundings\u2026I saw a group of three grinning</p><br/><p>amongst themselves as they observed the situation from afar.</p><br/><p>The two in front of me was a swordsman and another man wearing</p><br/><p>lightweight equipment. Most likely, he was in the profession of thieving.</p><br/><p>In the group of three, there was two that were wearing magician or priestlike</p><br/><p>robes, and a large warrior.</p><br/><p>I made a prediction. All of them were in the same party, and these two in</p><br/><p>front were meant to chase us out, according to their plan.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, the other three would follow and kill us as we run away, and</p><br/><p>then innocently regroup with the first two.</p><br/><p>I dare say that this was the scenario that they laid out.</p><br/><p>In this way, they must have killed the weaker demons and stolen their</p><br/><p>belongings.</p><br/><p>It was well thought up.</p><br/><p>However\u2026this time, they picked the wrong opponent!</p><br/><p>[Oi oi! You should patiently wait for your turn! I\u2019m a very tolerant fellow,</p><br/><p>so it\u2019s not too late for forgiveness. Hurry up and line up from the back!]</p><br/><p>I began provoking them.</p><br/><p>In that instant, the two in front of me were bewildered, and their faces</p><br/><p>quickly turned red.</p><br/><p>These guys had short tempers.</p><br/><p>[Putting up a front when you\u2019re nothing but a sh*tty small fry demon\u2026</p><br/><p>don\u2019t get cocky!]</p><br/><p>[Oi oi, you\u2019re as good as dead now! I even considered sparing your life if</p><br/><p>only you gave up your belongings!]</p><br/><p>They were reciting the kind of lines suited to petty underlings.</p><br/><p>Heh. Back when I was a general contractor, if you couldn\u2019t manage to</p><br/><p>make scary grim faced uncles dance to your tune, you just weren\u2019t fit for</p><br/><p>work.</p><br/><p>Among those uncles, there were even some that had playfully scribbled</p><br/><p>things (tattoos) on their body.</p><br/><p>The feeble threats of a greenhorn, was nothing more than passing wind.</p><br/><p>[A sh*tty small fry demon? Were you talking about me?]</p><br/><p>[Of course it\u2019s about you! The likes of a slime is a small fry among small</p><br/><p>fry!]</p><br/><p>[Hurry up and get over here. It looks like you can talk well, so I\u2019ll turn you</p><br/><p>into a demon slave without killing you!]</p><br/><p>A demon slave? There was something like that?</p><br/><p>Leaving that aside for the moment.</p><br/><p>The nearby merchants and adventurers were starting to notice the</p><br/><p>disturbance we were causing.</p><br/><p>I had to gather more attention.</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t know if such a thing as legitimate self-defence would</p><br/><p>work here\u2026it would be great if even a few people could testify for me.</p><br/><p>However, was there no kind human who would yell, \u2018I\u2019ll save you!\u2019, and</p><br/><p>come dashing out?</p><br/><p>If I was a beautiful girl, there might have been someone like that, but I</p><br/><p>guess it\u2019s unreasonable to expect for a slime.</p><br/><p>[Calling me small fry over and over, you sure talk arrogantly!</p><br/><p>Moreover\u2026me, a slime?]</p><br/><p>[No matter how I see it, you\u2019re definitely a slime!]</p><br/><p>[Damn you, messing with me\u2026! I can\u2019t forgive being made a fool of by a</p><br/><p>weakling like you! I\u2019ll kill you after all!]</p><br/><p>After saying that, the two readied their weapons.</p><br/><p>Ah! At last they were about to come at me.</p><br/><p>Oh boy. The first humans I got to talk to was like this\u2026. Such bad luck. To</p><br/><p>think that demons were friendlier.</p><br/><p>The people nearby had begun moving away to watch in a circle around us</p><br/><p>from afar.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the guards had also noticed the uproar, which might have been</p><br/><p>why they distanced themselves in such a hurry.</p><br/><p>Now then.</p><br/><p>I leisurely moved forwards and said,</p><br/><p>[Kukuku. You say I\u2019m a weakling? A slime? \u2026Since when did I become a</p><br/><p>slime! Or are you just confused?]</p><br/><p>I deliberately spoke as if to imply something else.</p><br/><p>It was true, that however you looked at it, I really am a slime. That was</p><br/><p>obvious from the very moment I was seen as a slime.</p><br/><p>But this was, an act!\u2026probably.</p><br/><p>[What did you say? Don\u2019t get carried away with bluffing!]</p><br/><p>[Hmph! If you\u2019re not a slime then show your real form already! After</p><br/><p>you\u2019re dead, you won\u2019t get to make excuses!]</p><br/><p>It seemed they would wait for me to transform.</p><br/><p>Just as planned!</p><br/><p>Even as a slime, I believe I could win against them.</p><br/><p>However! Holding back would be hard, so I might end up accidentally</p><br/><p>slicing them right in half.</p><br/><p>It was difficult to adjust my strength to the degree of only knocking them</p><br/><p>out.</p><br/><p>[All right then. I\u2019ll let you see, this true form of mine!]</p><br/><p>*This isn\u2019t even my final form!</p><br/><p>As I shouted, I also loosed a sinister aura to hint at my power.</p><br/><p>Of course, only a little bit of it.</p><br/><p>I checked around me to see if anyone had sensed that small amount of</p><br/><p>aura.</p><br/><p>Among the people watching us from far away, only a few had noticed.</p><br/><p>The two idiots before me and their companions showed no sign of being</p><br/><p>aware of it.</p><br/><p>These guys\u2026seemed to be all bark and no bite.</p><br/><p>I was done with observing the situation now. Now then, what should I turn</p><br/><p>into\u2026</p><br/><p>From my body erupted a thick fog.</p><br/><p>It completely shrouded my form\u2026and after a while it cleared away to</p><br/><p>reveal a different demon.</p><br/><p>A black wolf.</p><br/><p>Oh? I remember the last time I used Predation and transformed afterwards,</p><br/><p>I had taken the form of a Fanged Wolf\u2026</p><br/><p>Right now, I had black fur that was identical to that of the evolved Ranga</p><br/><p>and his pack.</p><br/><p>But not only that, my physique exceeded even Ranga\u2019s, and there was now</p><br/><p>a pair of horns on my forehead.</p><br/><p>Mimesis: Tempest Star Wolf</p><br/><p>\u2026It seems that, if the lineage of the demon I\u2019ve used Predation on evolved,</p><br/><p>it would also affect my mimicry.</p><br/><p>*Most likely related to Rimuru naming them, which makes them \u201cfamily\u201d and connected in a way</p><br/><p>This must have been a further evolved form of Ranga. I could feel an</p><br/><p>overwhelming power.</p><br/><p>I was sure that the idiot pair would run away upon seeing this appearance.</p><br/><p>But contrary to my expectation,</p><br/><p>[Ha! Even if you look tougher on the outside, it doesn\u2019t change that you\u2019re</p><br/><p>a slime!]</p><br/><p>[Oi oi, did you think we\u2019d get cold feet and run away from just that!?]</p><br/><p>\u2026They don\u2019t realize anything!</p><br/><p>Oi oi, you should be able to know the level of danger just by looking!</p><br/><p>In the first place, if a slime transforms, even if you couldn\u2019t tell if it was an</p><br/><p>illusion or something else, taking caution is a given.</p><br/><p>And yet, these guys weren\u2019t concerned in the least.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they were reassured by the presence of their three friends in</p><br/><p>hiding\u2026</p><br/><p>The number of skills I could use had also increased.</p><br/><p>\u300eSuper Olfaction, Thought Transmission, Intimidation, Shadow</p><br/><p>Movement, Black Lightning\u300f.</p><br/><p>Shadow Movement was a skill that Ranga and co was in the middle of</p><br/><p>practicing.</p><br/><p>Their goal was to become able to use the skill to merge into the shadow of</p><br/><p>their partner and instantly appear when called.</p><br/><p>At present, they were only practicing entering shadows, so there was still a</p><br/><p>long way to go.</p><br/><p>And the other, Black Lightning\u2026I could imagine its power without</p><br/><p>needing to test it. If I tried it out, the pitiful men in front of me would be</p><br/><p>burnt to black crisps.</p><br/><p>But since my predictions were rather poor, their conditions may turn out</p><br/><p>even worse. This being the case, there was no skills to use.</p><br/><p>If only \u300eIntimidation\u300f would work on these morons! In a way, aren\u2019t</p><br/><p>idiots invincible?</p><br/><p>Anyhow, the end result was that I only managed to terrify a few of the</p><br/><p>spectators out of their wits instead.</p><br/><p>[Oh boy\u2026I don\u2019t care anymore. This is too tiring, so just come at me!]</p><br/><p>I let them have the first strike.</p><br/><p>If I received damage while mimicking, what would happen?</p><br/><p>On one occasion, I had experimented on that question while in lizard form.</p><br/><p>I found out while continuously receiving attacks, that when a certain</p><br/><p>amount of damage accumulated, the mimicry would wear off.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, there was no damage that had transferred to my slime body.</p><br/><p>Most likely, it was because the skill Mimesis utilized magic essence to</p><br/><p>create a new body, which was why the main body couldn\u2019t be damaged.</p><br/><p>There were two restrictions on this skill. After Mimesis wore off, I would</p><br/><p>be unable to transform for the next 3 minutes, and the other was that</p><br/><p>mimicking a demon required a certain amount of magic essence.</p><br/><p>The amount of magic essence required was relatively insignificant, hence</p><br/><p>it was not an issue, and there was no duration limit to the skill.</p><br/><p>To sum up, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem in letting them attack me as much</p><br/><p>as they wanted.</p><br/><p>In the case that the opponents were strong, I could return to my slime form</p><br/><p>and escape immediately.</p><br/><p>And the fight began with them attacking first.</p><br/><p>[Heh, die!]</p><br/><p>[Raaaagh!!! \u300eWind Slash\u300f!!!!!]</p><br/><p>The thief threw multiple daggers towards me.</p><br/><p>And was that swordsman using a skill attack? His sword was glowing</p><br/><p>green as he swung the blade at me.</p><br/><p>Claaaang!</p><br/><p>Snap!!!</p><br/><p>Simultaneously throwing three daggers was quite impressive, but there</p><br/><p>wasn\u2019t enough force behind them to pierce my bristles.</p><br/><p>As for the swordsman, sadly\u2026his precious sword had broken with a snap.</p><br/><p>[Just now, did you do something?]</p><br/><p>Assuming the role of a villain with an air of experience, I enthusiastically</p><br/><p>asked them in a belittling way.</p><br/><p>But frankly, the power of their attacks were so weak that my question was</p><br/><p>rather reasonable.</p><br/><p>Was that skill nothing but a show?</p><br/><p>[N-, no way! Such hard bristles\u2026]</p><br/><p>*Real hard, baby</p><br/><p>[Impossible\u2026this-, this kind of thing, it\u2019s impossible!!! My sword was</p><br/><p>made with silver! It had a power amplifying effect against demons!!!]</p><br/><p>\u2026Well of course, isn\u2019t silver fragile? What was he even saying\u2026this guy.</p><br/><p>[Oi! You guys help out as well!!!]</p><br/><p>As if no longer caring for appearance, he called for his companions. As I</p><br/><p>expected, the three that were in hiding was a part of their group.</p><br/><p>[Heh! It\u2019s the end for you now!]</p><br/><p>[My my\u2026really, I didn\u2019t expect we would get a turn!]</p><br/><p>[A slime\u2019s transformation magic? Interesting. I\u2019ll be sure to dissect it after</p><br/><p>killing it!]</p><br/><p>[For a while now, it hasn\u2019t been moving at all. Moving will probably break</p><br/><p>the spell. How\u2019s that? Did I hit bullseye!?]</p><br/><p>They were making so much noise while saying whatever they liked.</p><br/><p>The five of them then spread out in a circle around me, and began</p><br/><p>attacking at the same time.</p><br/><p>The thief slashed at me with a short sword.</p><br/><p>This time, the swordsman casted a magic attack, \u300eWind Sickles\u300f. (He was</p><br/><p>surprisingly talented.)</p><br/><p>The heavy warrior bellowed [\u300eHeavy Slash\u300f!!!] as he swung his great axe.</p><br/><p>The magician also used a magic attack, \u300eFireball\u300f.</p><br/><p>The priest was creating a magic shield in preparation for my attack.</p><br/><p>As a party, it was a well balanced formation.</p><br/><p>Though unfortunately for them, none of their attacks had affected me\u2026</p><br/><p>I peeked a fleeting glance towards them.</p><br/><p>Apparently, they were too shocked to make a sound.</p><br/><p>If it was now, \u300eIntimidation\u300f might have an effect.</p><br/><p>Aruuuuuuu~~~!!!</p><br/><p>*Wolf howling. Believe me when I say I\u2019m really sorry \u2018bout the bad sound effects</p><br/><p>I used \u300eIntimidation\u300f on top of my howling.</p><br/><p>But, this turned out to be a massive failure\u2026</p><br/><p>Even the spectators were fainting over here, and wetting their pants over</p><br/><p>there.</p><br/><p>To put simply, the situation was a great disaster.</p><br/><p>Crap\u2026what should I do? This definitely wouldn\u2019t end well at all.</p><br/><p>Eh? What about the group of five?</p><br/><p>They had taken the full brunt of \u300eIntimidation\u300f at point-blank range.</p><br/><p>Well, of course\u2026</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t really a need to say it out loud.</p><br/><p>And suddenly, I detected a number of dwarven guardsmen that were</p><br/><p>running this way with \u300eMagic Perception\u300f.</p><br/><p>As for my current state of mind\u2026</p><br/><p>I gazed at the scene of people soiling their pants with various substances,</p><br/><p>and I unconcernedly thought to myself while escaping from reality,</p><br/><p>[Cleaning up after that mess would really suck huh~.]</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Titles: Crest of Storm</p><br/><p>Magic:</p><br/><p>None</p><br/><p>Skills:</p><br/><p>Unique Skill \u300eGreat Sage\u300f</p><br/><p>Unique Skill \u300ePredator\u300f</p><br/><p>Slime Inherent Skills \u300eDissolution, Absorption, Self-Regeneration\u300f</p><br/><p>Extra Skill \u300eWater Manipulation\u300f</p><br/><p>Extra Skill \u300eMagic Perception\u300f</p><br/><p>Acquired Skills:</p><br/><p>Black Snake \u300eHeat Perception, Poison Mist Breath\u300f</p><br/><p>Centipede \u300eParalysis Breath\u300f</p><br/><p>Spider \u300eSticky Thread, Steel Thread\u300f</p><br/><p>Bat \u300eUltrasonic Waves\u300f</p><br/><p>Lizard \u300eBody Armor\u300f</p><br/><p>Black Wolf \u300eSuper Olfaction, Thought Transmission, Intimidation,</p><br/><p>Shadow Movement, Black Lightning\u300f</p><br/><p>Resistances:</p><br/><p>Heat Fluctuation Resistance EX</p><br/><p>Physical Attack Resistance</p><br/><p>Pain Immunity</p><br/><p>Electrical Resistance</p><br/><p>Paralysis Resistance</p><br/>\n</div>"}

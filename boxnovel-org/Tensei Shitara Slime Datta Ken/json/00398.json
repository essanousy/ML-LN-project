That was when I realized that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>Shinji had greeted me most suspiciously.</p><br/><p>When I interrogated him, he said that Veldora and the others had gone off to another world without permission.</p><br/><p>They had used the Different Gate, which was still being worked on, and had been waiting for me to leave.</p><br/><p>Oh, dear. I thought.</p><br/><p>They clearly wanted to be the first to find something new, so they could brag about it later.</p><br/><p>I could see through them every time.</p><br/><p>As there was no point in waiting for them to return, I analyzed the remaining magic circle and tried to pinpoint their location.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;It is already complete&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Master Ciel was always ahead of me.</p><br/><p>I was not surprised. Just then, a \u2018Thought Transmission\u2019 arrived from Beretta.</p><br/><p>\u2018Lord Rimuru. There is a problem. The two others are also with me\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Beretta said.</p><br/><p>The timing was a little suspicious, but I didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>He had come to me for help and sounded very frantic.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Beretta had become involved in their mess as well.</p><br/><p>Stopping those two was a task too great for Beretta.</p><br/><p>Had he waited for the right moment and then called me secretly?</p><br/><p>In any case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShinji. It seems that they\u2019re causing a lot of trouble over there. I\u2019m going to go check on them. I\u2019ll leave the rest to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>I told him.</p><br/><p>As for Shinji, he was standing in front of the new researcher I had brought\u2014Irina. He was sweating and making excuses about something\u2026 Well, it had nothing to do with me.</p><br/><p>His cheeks were flushed as well, but there was no point in thinking about that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? Lord Rimuru!? Yo-you\u2019re really going to leave me in this situation alone\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Farewell, Shinji!</p><br/><p>Sorry, but I can\u2019t save you!!</p><br/><p>You two enjoy your time together.</p><br/><p>Oh, he looks like he\u2019s going to cry\u2014well, he is crying.</p><br/><p>In any case, I left Shinji there and used \u2018Interdimensional Teleportation\u2019 to go to where Beretta was.</p><br/><p>I was greeted by Beretta and tried to ask him about what had happened.</p><br/><p>However, it did not seem like we would have much time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Beretta began, I felt that the world was starting to creak.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey! You\u2019ve gone too far! Does Veldora not understand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, no, this isn\u2019t Lord Verldora\u2019s doing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to put up with this, Beretta. All right. I\u2019ll go and give him a good scolding!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris as well\u2013I said. And then I jumped towards Veldora and the others.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>And so I beat Veldora with my paper fan\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, what to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cGuh!? Rimuru!? Why are you here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! I just got mixed up in this mess because of Master!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora was surprised while Ramiris wasted no time in betraying him.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ramiris always made excuses, and there was no mistaking that she was an accomplice.</p><br/><p>Beretta seemed like he had meant to cover for her a little, but there were limits to what you could do.</p><br/><p>In any case, it was then that Beretta also teleported to our location.</p><br/><p>\u201cPl-please wait, Lord Rimuru! You have it wrong. We were experimenting with the magic circle and got caught in an accident!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta said frantically as he came after me.</p><br/><p>Hmm. An accident, huh?</p><br/><p>Is there more to this story?</p><br/><p>Or is he just making up excuses?</p><br/><p>After hearing Beretta\u2019s words, Veldora started to shout as if suddenly acquiring a will of his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly true, Rimuru. It is most hurtful that you always blame me for everything. And how can you hit me on the head like that so suddenly!\u201d</p><br/><p>He made a show of being angry and indignant, but his eyes looked oddly anxious.</p><br/><p>That suggested he was at least somewhat ashamed.</p><br/><p>And Ramiris betrayed Veldora immediately because she knew she had done something bad\u2026 It seemed like a good time to mislead them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Sorry about that. I actually wanted to praise you for making such a wonderful magic circle\u2026 But since you say it was an accident, I guess it was just a coincidence that it turned out so well?\u201d</p><br/><p>So, what would be their reaction?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because of my research! It wasn\u2019t an accident! It was all according to plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRamiris!? We both did the research! I won\u2019t forgive you for trying to steal all of the credit!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Idiots.</p><br/><p>They took the bait too easily.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Lord Ramiris, Lord Veldora\u2026 That\u2019s what you call a confession\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta muttered sadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>They realized at the same time.</p><br/><p>They let the cat out of the bag.</p><br/><p>But Beretta was guilty too. He had tried to lighten the crime by saying it was an accident, but perhaps he should have discussed it with the others in advance.</p><br/><p>Well, he may have had his reasons.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it seems there are more pressing matters. And this really doesn\u2019t seem like Veldora\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said as I looked towards the two Collapsers that were enlarging after sucking in energgy and matter from around them.</p><br/><p>The two Collapsers were affecting each other and growing, and there was a single woman between them\u2014the singularity of supergravity, a black hole that swallowed up everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to know! Apparently, it\u2019s called the Mobius System or something. That woman over there, Michelle; her power reactor caused it to go crazy. We were just trying to stop it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. We\u2019ve been desperately trying to stop the destruction of the world. I am very offended that you could blame it on me, Rimuru!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

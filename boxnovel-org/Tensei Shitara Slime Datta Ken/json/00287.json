Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it!\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Karma had moved in and blocked a monster who had rushed towards Julius in order to attack.</p><br/><p>After that, Karma, who had transformed into a red werewolf, stood next to Julius and continued to fight. His power was as great as the adults, and he was just as strong as Julius.</p><br/><p>Karma was acting on Magnus\u2019 order, as he had said that everything would be over should their commander fall.</p><br/><p>Karma obeyed without question, and Julius also seemed to have discarded his usual composed attitude, and readily accepted Karma\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>While Julius may have said various things in the past, he did in fact, accept that Karma had a true ability.</p><br/><p>The students were crossing the borders of their schools and working together.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>It was all very good up until this point.</p><br/><p>This point\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>What I first thought was strange, was Magnus\u2019 movements.</p><br/><p>He had sent Karma over to help Julius, while he relocated to where the monsters were relatively weaker.</p><br/><p>With Magnus\u2019 ability, it would be more appropriate for him to stay in an area where the attacks were more vicious.</p><br/><p>As I was curious, I used \u2018Magic Detection\u2019 to get an overhead view and observe Magnus\u2019 actions.</p><br/><p>Then I saw that Rozari, the girl who seemed praise Magnus a whole lot, had left the frontlines. She was running towards the group of spare forces.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Spare forces\u2013the people who had finished being treated for their injuries or put on their summoning items. Or so I had thought, but on further inspection, it seemed like that was not the case.</p><br/><p>They were not treating the wounded there, instead, the wounded were being roughly carried to a different tent.</p><br/><p>As for the group\u2026</p><br/><p>When I looked closely, I saw that they had finished putting on matching white robes.</p><br/><p>There was Clad, who was one of the knights that guarded Julius, and even the combat teacher from Ingracia, who had not joined the fight at all.</p><br/><p>Could it be that they are\u2026 Just as I thought this, things started to move at once.</p><br/><p>First, the teachers who were fighting the poison tiger were poisoned and fell.</p><br/><p>There was Master Brown and Master Peter from the Tempest Human Development Resource Academy.</p><br/><p>Master William and Master Blum from the Ingracia Academy.</p><br/><p>And to combat teachers whose names I did not know from NNU Magic and Science Investigation Academy.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The six of them had been holding the poison tiger back, but now it was free.</p><br/><p>The teachers weren\u2019t dead.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t dead, because Moss was protecting them. However, they might as well have been, as they were unconscious.</p><br/><p>And so the poison tiger was now ignoring them and was now attacking the wall of students led by Julius.</p><br/><p>\u201cJulius, this is bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk! If only there was a Hero\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Julius!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karma.</p><br/><p>Even Maria and Carole, who always followed Julius.</p><br/><p>They were all looking at Julius with expressions of anger and despair.</p><br/><p>As for Julius\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I won\u2019t give up. Masayuki would have\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Hmmm\u2026 I wonder about that?</p><br/><p>If anything, he would probably just run away. Yes, there was a good chance of that.</p><br/><p>He would ask Venom to stop the monster and in the meantime\u2026</p><br/><p>And then that person, who could now be called Masayuki\u2019s director, would lecture him and bring him back.</p><br/><p>However, the timing would also be perfect, as it would be right before Venom was about to be defeated.</p><br/><p>Spectators of the scene could not be blamed for seeing this as a Hero coming to save the day in the nick of time.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t seem too lucky for Venom, but that was their problem.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t care about Masayuki, anyway.</p><br/><p>Right now, the students were important.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Julius gripped his sword with strong determination, and without showing a hint of fear, he stood in front of the poison tiger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be joining you, Julius!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry about everything, Karma. As someone who is in a position of power, I have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I understand. But we can be friends from now on, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes. Let\u2019s make it out of this alive!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Julius and Karma, and the other students as well.</p><br/><p>They were in a hopeless situation, but they did not give up.</p><br/><p>I wanted to give them all a passing grade.</p><br/><p>I liked their spirit.</p><br/><p>As for Julius, it would be necessary to guide him a little in terms of the way he thought, but I felt that he had at least the bare minimum of what a leader needed.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t win this round, but I thought that I would help a little after he was defeated by the poison tiger.</p><br/><p>That was what I thought, as I observed them fighting.</p><br/><p>As I knew from the beginning that they would not be able to beat the poison tiger, I had planned for Moss to beat it back once everyone had been defeated.</p><br/><p>The only thing left was to see what these suspicious-looking people in the white robes would do. Also, Magnus\u2019 movements\u2026</p><br/><p>But they did not look like they intended to join the fight until all of the students and teachers had fallen.</p><br/><p>What horrible people. I thought with anger as I viewed them.</p><br/><p>And once they saw that the last of the combat students had fallen, they began their move.</p><br/><p>Two of the figures in white robes moved out and began to dispose of the monsters at a much faster pace than the teachers had been managing.</p><br/><p>And then another stepped out in front of us survivors and activated a magic barrier.</p><br/><p>The survivors were overwhelmed with shock and confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will protect all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Magnus.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>As if to prove this claim, he went off alone to face the poison tiger.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.Stupidity? No, it wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Magnus\u2019 movements were full of confidence, and it seemed that he understood that his victory was a certain thing.</p><br/><p>And of course, he was right.</p><br/><p>He began to fight with the poison tiger with a power that exceeded that of an A-ranker.</p><br/><p>And so he was successful in driving it away.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk. It escaped. Ah, well. At least I accomplished what I wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Magnus said this as if it was nothing.</p><br/><p>In fact, it seemed like Magnus had yet to show his full potential. And the poison tiger was not much of a problem in his eyes.</p><br/><p>At this point, it was all but proven, that it had been Magnus and the others who had tricked Julius.</p><br/><p>As Clad was Julius\u2019 guard, he would have had plenty of opportunities to mix the herbs in his food.</p><br/><p>And more than anything\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, all of you. There are two options for you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Out of nowhere, a single woman came out and made this declaration.</p><br/><p>Her words were directed at us, the non-combat students.</p><br/><p>It seemed as if she had been waiting for this moment when all of the fighters had been defeated.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That\u2019s exactly right!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems the sage William also got my intentions and was gushing with motivation.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t look hesitant anymore and a strong light was burning in his eyes.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do, please let me know!\u201d</p><br/><p>William vigorously nodded.</p><br/><p>The students who had lost all hope also regained their liveliness after having the freshly baked bread-like food and the soup.</p><br/><p>Delicious food is the best medicine.</p><br/><p>After all, it\u2019s a special recipe made by Ciel-sensei which even I get to eat rarely.</p><br/><p>As I made it with \u2018auto-mode\u2019, it would be impossible to recreate it by myself.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>If I want to eat it again, I will have to ask Ciel.</p><br/><p>And since they had such a God\u2019s (Ciel) cooking, of course the students\u2019 reaction was this.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo deliciouuusssss!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously, what is this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha\u2014the stew last night was amazing too but this is even better?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSatoru-kun, you were a cooking genius, huh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would very much like you to be my bride.\u201d</p><br/><p>High praises here and there.</p><br/><p>Although there were some idiots asking me to be their brides, I guess it just shows that they are lively enough to say that.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>And like this, the gloomy atmosphere was blown away with one shot and the youth-like cheerful atmosphere returned.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, I stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what will you guys do? Will you cry yourself to sleep here and beg Magnus for help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 well, even if you say that, Satoru-kun\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karma answered me as the representative of the students.</p><br/><p>The instructors only watched over.</p><br/><p>Exactly how I planned it with William.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Karma, was it? What about you? if you lose then that\u2019s the end? Aren\u2019t you frustrated being called a dejected loser?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did ya say?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karma\u2019s burning eyes filled with anger glared at me, unlike a honor student.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>That\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>Anger will fuel your will to live.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Julius. You too. You act all high and mighty all the time but you aren\u2019t anything special, are you? \u2018It is the royalty\u2019s job to protect the people\u2019, \u2018it is the responsibility of the people who stand on top\u2019\u2013these are phrases someone with strength should say. What kind of a leader are you? Can\u2019t even see through a guy like Magnus\u2019 real intentions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReal intentions? He has been fooling us from the start. He easily abandoned me after asking me to join him. I also believed my envoy, Clad, because he introduced him to me\u2026 In reality, I actually thought of him as my best friend\u2026 I had thought of him as my best friend.. who would bind us together\u2026 me, who can\u2019t live as I will because I am royalty\u2026 with the school friends and Karma\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems Julius was shocked the most.</p><br/><p>After he was defeated by the monster, he was being protected by Moss. And even in that vague state of consciousness, he probably heard their conversation.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then, after being healed, he got to know of Magnus\u2019 true strength and realized that they had been abandoned.</p><br/><p>Above all, it was all clear when his envoy Clad didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t cooperate, then their half-hearted strength would only be a hindrance.</p><br/><p>Julius was probably thought as the epitome of that and a target to be dispose of right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why didn\u2019t you speak freely with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have spoken freely with your hearts out with Magnus before something like this happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

But you know, that\u2019s just an excuse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhh\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Julius frowned but couldn\u2019t talk back.</p><br/><p>It seems he is looking back at his actions without trying to talk back imprudently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what will you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you cry yourself to sleep like Karma here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2014Magnus is way stronger than\u2026.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cOh what, you will give up just \u2018cause you can\u2019t win? You know, if there\u2019s one thing that bastard Masayuki didn\u2019t do, it\u2019s giving up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.That bastard Masayuki?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, this is bad.</p><br/><p>I ended up calling him as I normally do.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh, no, no, I meant the Hero Masayuki-sama, yes. What I want to say is, basically, you need the spirit to at least be able to call that hero-sama a bastard!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of instructors were watching over me with warm eyes as I tried to gloss it over.</p><br/><p>When I glanced at them, thinking I would reduce their salary, they hurriedly looked away.</p><br/><p>And among all that,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s exactly as Satoru-kun says. You people, it\u2019s unforgivable to stay defeated like this when you are the proud students of the academy. It seems the battle instructors are also going to train so you people should also work hard! Even if you get wounded, I will patch you up properly. The founder of the academy, the Great Demon Lord Rimuru-sama is also probably watching over us from our country so show him your pride and dignity as the students of the academy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The health doctor Pyuri came following up.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Her fluttering gray waver reflected the sunlight, making her look truly as the Goddess of victory.</p><br/><p>It seems the simple male students were motivated with just that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! The hero Masayuki\u2019s divine protection will surely protect us as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s even a tiny bit of such protection but I guess I will nod to William\u2019s words as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will you do, Julius? Won\u2019t you stand in front of everyone and lead us? Decide already!\u201d</p><br/><p>In response to my words, Julius discarded all hesitation and looked me in the eye and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do it. I won\u2019t be able to settle down either if I don\u2019t say a thing or two to Magnus. The next time, whether it\u2019s some monster or Magnus, I will win!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems Julius is also motivated.</p><br/><p>Just as I had predicted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s all work hard and show them what we\u2019re made of! If we win, I will consider treating you all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>I declared with a complacent smile.</p><br/><p>And immediately afterwards\u2013</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cUuuwwooohhh!! I will do it!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to us, Satoru-chan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaa\u2014-Satoru-kun! This onee-san will protect you, alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould we perhaps have any right to that reward as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Such excited cheering shook up the place.</p><br/><p>The frenzy was so much that I had to put myself on guard for a moment there.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the plump instructor said something about the reward there as well but I will pretend I didn\u2019t hear it as the other instructors took him away.</p><br/><p>Either way, I succeeded in lighting a fire in them.</p><br/><p>And like this, the special training for the day of counterattack began.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

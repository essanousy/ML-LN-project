His arm is not himself, so I fail to see how you can punish the whole individual for an offense committed soley by his arm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell put,\u201d the judge replied with a grin. \u201cUsing that same logic, I sentence the defendant\u2019s arm to one year\u2019s imprisonment.

Hinata and the Kids</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a week since Fritz and Hinata reached Ingracia.</p><br/><p>Even considering that they hitched a ride on a passing carriage, it still took time. But no: for Hinata, impatience was banned.</p><br/><p>Using a magic circle would have been faster but would not have allowed them to grasp the state of Ingracia as a trip would have.</p><br/><p>Fritz and Hinata decided to disguise themselves as an adventurer\u2019s daughter and a normal, spirited youth.</p><br/><p>Hinata had equipment left over from my adventuring days, so she used that. Fritz purchased some from a travelling peddler.</p><br/><p>But they had no qualms about their equipment. Demon Lord Rimuru had sent them modified Spirit Bracelets that could transform into full armament set upon command.</p><br/><p>Though the quality of transformed gear did suffer as a result, it was still unique classed. Why did the Demon Lord do this she did not know, but she did appreciate it.</p><br/><p>So even should the worst come to be, they would not need to rely on what they carry, and used it rather for disguise.</p><br/><p>And thus they deigned these shabby clothes and ventured onward.</p><br/><p>Oh, and they snuck into the kingdom using fake ids.</p><br/><p>Currently Hinata is staying at a cheap inn in the outskirts of town.</p><br/><p>For a whole week Hinata has not left her room. She\u2019s been using spirit familiars to scout the happenings of that city.</p><br/><p>Fritz, however, is hanging around the Academy. With his own eyes and ears does he study the city.</p><br/><p>Trying to figure out a way into the academy or if some merchant needs protection.</p><br/><p>The Academy is a fortress, guests are not permitted.</p><br/><p>Except, that is, entrance into Academy\u2019s Library is open to public, but it is undoubtedly being supervised by Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Hinata is trying to find a way in without alerting Yuuki of her presence.</p><br/><p>During his investigation Fritz came to know a number of food distributors employed by the Academy and was able to convince them to be a merchant selling food.</p><br/><p>The thing is, the Academy has a lot of students.</p><br/><p>They need a lot of merchants and workers just to prepare a single meal for all the students.</p><br/><p>Thus, Fritz and Hinata were able to secure work inside the Academy helping around the kitchen.</p><br/><p>And so another week passed. As their work continued they began investigating.</p><br/><p>They had to move during the morning deliveries. Though the morning meals were simple they still required extensive preparation.</p><br/><p>After observing the workplace for a week they found the best time to move.</p><br/><p>If they were to deliver the meals while it was still dark surely they could snoop around and leave unseen.</p><br/><p>Over the course of the week they more or less figured out the layout of the academy.</p><br/><p>Using spirit familiars they found a source of strong light spirit energy.</p><br/><p>And just as Rimuru has said, there was a child blessed by the light spirit.</p><br/><p>Hinata heard the full story at the banquet. Though she once dismissed his words as utter nonsense she now felt a duty to protect these younglings.</p><br/><p>In a way a they were her disciples too.</p><br/><p>(Clown\u2019s note: the reason being that they are taught in a school where she was taught in, so it\u2019s like they are her underclassmen [kouhai], but a bit more than that, because this academy is closer to a martial arts dojo. So as someone who\u2019s</p><br/><p>\u201cgraduated\u201d the academy she now feels responsible for them)</p><br/><p>But she was still not satisfied with his explanation for why they were summoned.</p><br/><p>Think about it: Yuuki told Rimuru that Hinata summoned them while attempting to summon a real hero.</p><br/><p>But leaving the difficulty and need for raising a new hero aside, neither Hinata nor the Church summoned the children.</p><br/><p>In other words, Yuuki must have done it.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, why did he do it? Did he fail at summoning and got them? Or did he intend to summon them to begin with?</p><br/><p>That Hinata could not understand.</p><br/><p>Both Hinata and Rimuru had figured out during their confrontation that Yuuki was trying to pin the guilt for the summoning on Hinata.</p><br/><p>So that question aside, the more important one still remained: why?</p><br/><p>Perhaps he merely took advantage of a failed summoning.</p><br/><p>But she felt that she had to know the reason for why he did it. And who said that there were only 5 children whom he summoned? And what about adults?</p><br/><p>All these thoughts swirled inside her head causing her great anxiety.</p><br/><p>But she decided to dismiss them all and focus on creating a plan to rescue the children.</p><br/><p>Thus came that fateful day.</p><br/><p>Fritz finished the preparations and Hinata went off to deliver the provisions to the Academy.</p><br/><p>After working thus for a week Hinata has gotten rather friendly with the grannies working there.</p><br/><p>But that thought led her to recall the fact that her current appearance is obscured by a magic item; she instead looks like an average red haired girl.</p><br/><p>So the grannies are not talking to her, but to this red haired appearance of her. This thought made her feel strangely lonely.</p><br/><p>But it was not the time for such sentimentalities.</p><br/><p>Deliver the goods, wait for an opportunity, and proceed with Fritz to the source of that light. Hinata and Fritz would move as planned.</p><br/><p>They would aim for that moment when the merchants deliver the food and begin returning home.</p><br/><p>She would create an illusion of herself leaving the premises and instead head for the children. Thus, the red girl would chat her way out instead of Hinata.</p><br/><p>The magic would only work up until she would leave the premises, but that much time should be enough.</p><br/><p>Today she merely planned to talk to the children and confirm that they were not in any immediate danger.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes should be plenty to see how they are doing, and that would be the first step.</p><br/><p>Of course, should things turn sour she was fully ready to blast her way out.</p><br/><p>In that case, she would never again talk with those grannies\u2026</p><br/><p>And that thought did bother her, but it did not sway her resolve.</p><br/><p>Fritz was busy with work so she decided to head off alone.</p><br/><p>Straight for that light.</p><br/><p>She used an invisibility spell and suppressed her presence to its utmost limits to remain undetected.</p><br/><p>Up to the third floor, without making a single sound.</p><br/><p>Her basic parameters strengthened by magic, she moved as a superwoman. Unlocked a door with magic, and slipped in without as much as a whisper.</p><br/><p>And found herself in a dimly lit classroom.</p><br/><p>Light barely entered it: obvious, considering that it was still 6 am.</p><br/><p>But it was nonetheless a bizarre room. There were few desks\u2013only four.</p><br/><p>There was a door in the back, connecting to another classroom.</p><br/><p>There were some doors out in the hall, but could they really be called doors? They were locked not with keys but with magic, so she could not open them.</p><br/><p>It was a strange design. This could hardly be called a normal classroom.</p><br/><p>Pondering it all for a second, she instead turned and headed for the room emitting that light. Time was of essence, so she had to press forward.</p><br/><p>Hinata opened the door and entered.</p><br/><p>A dining table was being prepared; so she felt life inside the room.</p><br/><p>Hinata carefully proceeded onward.</p><br/><p>There was something akin a bedroom partitioned off.</p><br/><p>Four futon lay there; so that\u2019s where the kids slept.</p><br/><p>And then, Hinata unconsciously took a step back&gt;</p><br/><p>Had she not done so, she would have been hit by a wooden sword.</p><br/><p>\u300cWow\u2026 you dodged that. Great! Thief?\u300d</p><br/><p>A voice came from a bossy child who seem to have just risen.</p><br/><p>A weak-spirited Japanese boy, a European pretty boy.</p><br/><p>And a blond pretty girl.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy\u2019d you come? There\u2019s nothing to steal here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnee-chan, who are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>The Japanese boy and the blond girl asked Hinata.</p><br/><p>The European child stood strong as if protecting the other kids. The bossy kid stood in the back.</p><br/><p>Hinata let out a sigh and raised both hands showing she had no desire to fight.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe one with the wooden sword is Misaki Kenya, kun?</p><br/><p>And there\u2019s no need to be so tense, Gale-kun\u300d</p><br/><p>She called out.</p><br/><p>Just as Rimuru had described them. The five children\u2026 except the black haired Chloe O\u2019Bell; she seems to be missing.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou know us?\u300d</p><br/><p>The weak looking boy, Sekiguchi Ryota asked.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. I heard about you from Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Misaki Kenya, Sekiguchi Ryota, Gale Gibson, Alise Rondo, right?</p><br/><p>And one more, Chloe O\u2019Bell\u2026 whom I don\u2019t see here.</p><br/><p>Just as Rimuru had said.</p><br/><p>My name is Sakiguchi Hinata.</p><br/><p>You may have heard some bad things about me, but I am not here to endanger you.</p><br/><p>I came to chat, but it seems we\u2019re out of time.</p><br/><p>It would be great if I could get you to trust me\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Kenya sat in a chair, his wooden sword in hand.</p><br/><p>Without a single change in his demeanor,</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, so you\u2019re Rimuru-sensei\u2019s acquaintance\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, with a relieved smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut isn\u2019t Hinata Sakaguchi a name of a villain!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, the person who summoned us, had no use for us, and tried to kill us! And we\u2019re only here because Yuuki-oniichan and Rimuru-sensei saved us\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut she doesn\u2019t seem like an enemy. It\u2019s alright to trust her\u2026 no?\u300d</p><br/><p>While saying various things, the children sat in chairs.</p><br/><p>Seems like being Rimuru\u2019s acquaintance earned her some trust.</p><br/><p>But she did not for a second confuse it with trust for her; the stories they heard about her must have made her sound like the Satan himself.</p><br/><p>That made her frown a bit, but at least it did not cause them to attack her outright.</p><br/><p>In the first place, those were nothing but groundless accusations.</p><br/><p>Sadly, there was no time to explain. So she figured she\u2019ll go with the flow and give them the rundown of the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, thanks for trusting me.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve met with Rimuru and heard of your from him.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have the time for a full explanation\u2026 in short, I want to take you to Rimuru\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll explain everything there\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Rimuru-sensei\u2019s place? I want to go!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut won\u2019t the church come after us\u2026 I do want to go though\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Conversation filled the room.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe church will not pose a problem\u2026</p><br/><p>I want you to listen without yelling. I am the Church\u2019s Guard Captain Hinata.</p><br/><p>Well, I was.</p><br/><p>The one you spoke of earlier, the \u201cHinata who summoned us\u201d is me.</p><br/><p>But, to get to the point, I did not summon you.</p><br/><p>Please believe me.</p><br/><p>And that too will be explained in due time\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhhaaattt?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? But if the church was not responsible, who was, then?</p><br/><p>Why are we trapped in here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight\u2026 If you think about it, a stalker?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut this Onee-chan could be lying, you know!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata narrowed her eyes observing the children.</p><br/><p>As she had expected, she\u2019ll have to struggle to convince them.</p><br/><p>She had not the time to explain enough to convince them. So if this was not enough, she would have to return again.</p><br/><p>Before she met Rimuru she would have just put them under protection and taken them from here by force.</p><br/><p>Hinata was the kind of person who would choose the shortest and safest path and logically put that plan into motion.</p><br/><p>But now? Here she is trying to sway the hearts of a bunch of children.</p><br/><p>How weak I have become, she thought.</p><br/><p>Showing emotion would surely increase the chance of failure\u2013that she understood.</p><br/><p>And if the kids show hostility, then she would have failed. She would have to come again and again while avoiding detection.</p><br/><p>But Hinata nonetheless chose to reveal her identity to them.</p><br/><p>Forcing your thoughts on others is mere self-satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Hinata now chose the longest path, and found that fact hilarious. But she did not regret this change.</p><br/><p>That one thing about her did not change: she refused to regret.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s alright. We can trust her.</p><br/><p>My pal, Hikaru says so!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah! I also think so. I mean, this Onee-chan is loved by the spirits!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, true. I also believe her\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, it\u2019s decided. Let\u2019s go. But we should hurry. Can we go like this?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata opened her eyes wide looking at the children.</p><br/><p>She did not expect for it to be this easy. Going now would also be contrary to the plan.</p><br/><p>Besides,</p><br/><p>\u300cI appreciate the sentiment, but we can\u2019t leave just yet.</p><br/><p>Most importantly\u2026where\u2019s the fifth\u2013Chloe?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnee-chan\u2026 who are you talking about?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe don\u2019t know anyone by that name?\u300d</p><br/><p>What? She thought they were joking, but their eyes were serious.</p><br/><p>There was no hint of lie in their words. They are telling the truth.</p><br/><p>But, how\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m late!\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s when Fritz came in.</p><br/><p>They had too little time, there was no time to hesitate.</p><br/><p>They have to leave now or plan it for another day.</p><br/><p>If they were to wait, there would be new risks. Besides, the kids seem to be ready for travel, so this looks like a good opportunity.</p><br/><p>But Chloe is not with them, and that\u2019s a problem.</p><br/><p>And while Hinata was thus deliberating,</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s nothing to fret about, you know? I mean, I can\u2019t let you take them\u300d</p><br/><p>A lad calls out to Hinata with a smile.</p><br/><p>Fritz jumped back drawing his sword.</p><br/><p>Black hair and black eyes. They were familiar with this man. And he just snuck up on a Fritz.</p><br/><p>And not just Fritz; neither the kids nor Hinata noticed him approaching.</p><br/><p>He was no ordinary man.</p><br/><p>\u300cKagurazaka Yuuki\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata muttered.</p><br/><p>There, before the, stood the Freedom Association Master.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeems like I was only able to reel in two fish with this bait (children).</p><br/><p>Well, I guess it\u2019s fine. Guard Captain Hinata, you are no small fry.</p><br/><p>I guess the bait served its purpose\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki said with a smile full of absolute bliss, causing Hinata to fear.</p><br/><p>She felt cold sweat forming on her back and her senses screamed danger.</p><br/><p>Bracing herself, she made her resolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe smiling boy of her memories\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What load of nonsense.</p><br/><p>Her hair stood on its ends faced with such evil.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s still smiling and he appears calm.</p><br/><p>But what she fears is his presence.</p><br/><p>This kind of evil she just had to immediately vanquish.</p><br/><p>Steeling her resolve, she confronted Yuuki!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

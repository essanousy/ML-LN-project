They are currently in charge of chapter 52 and will be working on many more to come.</p><br/><p>Clown: That reminds me of a joke\u2026 So a translator gets 400 words to translate. The client asks him, how long will it take? The translator replies, about a week. Shocked, the Client says, A whole week for just 400 words? God created the world in 6 days. The Translator looks at the client, and responds, then just take a look at this world and afterwards take a look at my translation.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Life in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>Chapter 46 \u2013 A Country\u2019s Name and Two Treaties</p><br/><p>The city has gotten rather pretty.</p><br/><p>\u201cBehold the results of my hard work!\u201d Isn\u2019t something I can say, however.</p><br/><p>But that aside,</p><br/><p>I fussed over a few things: toilets, plumbing, insect repellents, and baths!</p><br/><p>The first three we made in Japanese style. I also built window screens using spider thread.</p><br/><p>At first, we had built the toilet seats out of wood, but that was no good.</p><br/><p>Though that\u2019s how the Japanese did it, its unbearable to maintain. It rots, you know.</p><br/><p>So I turned to the dwarfs.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve never failed at their task, so perhaps they could do something about the toilet problem.</p><br/><p>\u300eThought Manipulation\u300fwas very useful this time around. It is the evolved form of\u300eThought Transmission\u300fbut its use stayed pretty much the same.</p><br/><p>So using it, I could easily transmit an image to them.</p><br/><p>Drawing and explaining it would be have difficult, but sending them a mental image was not.</p><br/><p>Even then however, when I showed them flush toilet system saying, \u201cWhen you push the lever water flows down!\u201d, reproducing it was impossible.</p><br/><p>It could be made with high level water magic stones, which absorb water from the air, but they are very expensive.</p><br/><p>Also, since they need to be frequently replaced, they are rarely used even for military objectives.</p><br/><p>Honestly, only the very rich could afford to create this.</p><br/><p>Since we don\u2019t have the needed capital, we would do with what we have.</p><br/><p>In any case, we can leave complex plumbing systems for later.</p><br/><p>So for now, we supplied water to tubs in every household from which one can then draw water.</p><br/><p>And, after filling the toilet bowl with water, you can then flush it down.</p><br/><p>So Kaijin lived up to his reputation yet again.</p><br/><p>Thus, I had strictly commanded the monsters to watch personal hygiene and dental care.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know whether monsters can develop dental problems, but there\u2019s no harm in making sure they don\u2019t.</p><br/><p>According to Kaijin, adventurers tend to either befriend people who know \u3008Cleaning Magic\u3009, or learn it themselves.</p><br/><p>That way, they can avoid staying dirty during long trips.</p><br/><p>Though mostly the high ranking ones concerned themselves with these things.</p><br/><p>Now, about the insect repellent.</p><br/><p>As you\u2019d expect, the forest has a lot of bugs. Since you can\u2019t protect yourself against them, there\u2019s a chance of catching diseases they carry.</p><br/><p>While that\u2019s not a problem for me, the Hobgoblins do get sick.</p><br/><p>So, I tried to fix this problem.</p><br/><p>I asked the dwarfs to create it, but they couldn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>I guess we\u2019d have to go and buy it in the human cities. Though we have no money.</p><br/><p>I asked the three idiots to go get it, but this is what they said,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t ask the impossible! It\u2019s super expensive!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBesides, we wouldn\u2019t know how much we\u2019d need to buy to cover a whole city with!</p><br/><p>You\u2019d find that quantity only in the Royal Capital!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-danna, can you imagine how hard it would be to transport?\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what they said.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t mind them coming over to hang out, but they should at least be of some use sometimes.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they are getting too friendly with Shuna.</p><br/><p>Often cooking together, buying her wares\u2013trying to get closer to her.</p><br/><p>And we even built them a house to stay in during their visits.</p><br/><p>The monsters\u2019 birth rate dropped to to that of humans.</p><br/><p>Thus, I\u2019ll need to figure out what to do about marriage soon.</p><br/><p>I want Orc, Goblins, and Lizardmen to have the right to choose whomever they love.</p><br/><p>It would be good if they produce stronger offspring.</p><br/><p>But there is a problem: should I allow polygamy?</p><br/><p>This might be especially helpful to women who have lost their husband. The oni, for example, can reproduce with any race, but choose not to.</p><br/><p>All their magical energy gets absorbed in the process, and some have not been able to recover it.</p><br/><p>As Benimaru said,</p><br/><p>\u300cBut that isn\u2019t something Rimuru-sama should be concerned about, right?</p><br/><p>Many people have lost all their magical energy after naming monsters, and even Demon Lords generally avoid it, after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>Way to drop the bomb.</p><br/><p>Hey, hey!!! How many do you think I\u2019ve named by now! And you mention it now!</p><br/><p>Thank goodness it has been replenishing till now.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll have to be more careful about naming monsters from now on. Well\u2026 replenishing energy just seems to natural to me; call it an adult\u2019s intuition or something.</p><br/><p>Anyways, it seems there are also two types of children produced by oni.</p><br/><p>The first are created with but seed, the second is truly labored over.</p><br/><p>The former is made by combining some of one\u2019s magical power, and while they do inherit some abilities, they tend to be weaker. The latter you pour all your strength into.</p><br/><p>But your life span shortens as a result.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m fine alone! I\u2019m not interested!\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s personal.</p><br/><p>By the way, it\u2019s different for women.</p><br/><p>They can reject a seed they believe too weak. So if they were forced, that would mean that the partner was stronger; but if deception was involved, then they wouldn\u2019t bear a child.</p><br/><p>They aren\u2019t allowed to bear children with just anyone.</p><br/><p>And this is common among high ranking monsters and devils, it seems.</p><br/><p>Goblins and other Demi-Humans, since they don\u2019t possess superb strength, are not much different than humans.</p><br/><p>So far, we\u2019ve had about 5~10 children born, and not more than 2 at a time.</p><br/><p>In any case, in order to ensure that they leave offspring, I will allow polygamy. However, only limited to widows!</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s the rule I passed. I\u2019ll change it when needed.</p><br/><p>Every new moon, we decided to hold a confession festival, and new couples would be given a home.</p><br/><p>Singles would continue living in tenement housing.</p><br/><p>Well, if they occupy some important post, they are free to live on their own.</p><br/><p>That much doesn\u2019t bother me personally.</p><br/><p>In the end, I won\u2019t be able to make sure everyone\u2019s satisfied, but there is a custom to accept my wishes in this city.</p><br/><p>When interests clash, residents bicker, they come seeking my decision.</p><br/><p>Well, the Elder Bunch also handles many of these, so my involvement can be said to be limited\u2026 to some degree.</p><br/><p>Everyone is trying to be very considerate of me so they try to avoid causing trouble.</p><br/><p>I was surprised at how cooperative the monsters really are.</p><br/><p>When it comes to government, whether socialism or capitalism, both will eventually rot and fall apart.</p><br/><p>A Land ruled by a truly just King. Where everyone is equal.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tis but a pipe dream. However\u2026</p><br/><p>I decided to aim for that dream.</p><br/><p>I pray I will never fall into vice. Should I become truly depraved, I hope someone will end me.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I thought while observing the Confession Festival.</p><br/><p>Now that we\u2019ve stabilized the life here and passed all (seemingly) necessary rules, I want to go and see how humans live.</p><br/><p>Besides, I can now transform into a human; it\u2019s about time I go and learn from them.</p><br/><p>Normally, those who have reincarnated into a different world make a big deal about meeting humans; I, however, have met very few so far.</p><br/><p>The group outside of the Dwarfs\u2019 city, Shizu-san, the three idiots\u2026 and that\u2019s all?</p><br/><p>Nor have I forgotten my original objective of meeting fellow World Travelers.</p><br/><p>From Shizu-san\u2019s memories\u2013her two students: Kagurazaka Yuuki and Sakaguchi Hinata.</p><br/><p>I do want to meet the two of them, but Sakaguchi Hinata sounds like bad news.</p><br/><p>There was also something that bothered me. Why did the kind Shizu-san allow Hinata to go on her own?</p><br/><p>As her senpai, as a fellow Japanese, shouldn\u2019t she have seen her off? I must meet Hinata and confirm.</p><br/><p>I have acquired some of the memories from targets I\u2019ve consumed with \u300ePredator\u300f, but certainly not all. Lingering memories are easier to acquire, I guess.</p><br/><p>When I meet her, I should confirm what I know.</p><br/><p>The three idiots have passed along my message to their Guild Master, and also looked after the letter I wrote.</p><br/><p>That letter simply expresses my desire to meet him.</p><br/><p>Though he\u2019s but a chief of a small country\u2019s Freedom Association branch, he is a Guild Master. He should have connections.</p><br/><p>Hopefully I can get some benefits from meeting him.</p><br/><p>If it goes over well, maybe he could even try to introduce me to the Grand Master Kagurazaka Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Since things have calmed down around here, I can probably leave for a bit.</p><br/><p>However, to do that there is something I lack.</p><br/><p>Right! Money.</p><br/><p>The three idiots were pretty poor, and didn\u2019t have much money on them. Not that I expected better of them.</p><br/><p>I want to buy vegetable seeds, magic stones, handicraft, and whatever seems impressive.</p><br/><p>I initially planned to sell some \u201cDemon Steel\u201d, but decided against it.</p><br/><p>The reason is simple. \u201cDemon Steel\u201d is too precious of a resource.</p><br/><p>Since we use it in our weapons and armor, selling it would be almost sacrilegious.</p><br/><p>It is also invaluable for production of mounted soldiers\u2019 weapons. Since it can change shape at will, it\u2019s useful for receiving and dealing various attacks, to say nothing of carrying it.</p><br/><p>And while I do have a lot of it, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an infinite amount. So let\u2019s hold off selling it until we can replenish our stock.</p><br/><p>As for iron ore and such, we discovered some in the mountain\u2019s district, and are buying it off the high orcs.</p><br/><p>So Kurobee and Kaijin are using it as a base to create weapons.</p><br/><p>We also need a lot of magic stones for research. Those are created by the human Ghost Researchers and does not appear naturally.</p><br/><p>They manufacture it from crystallized magic stones they extract from monsters.</p><br/><p>It also seems to require large factories, so is only done at the Freedom Association\u2019s headquarters.</p><br/><p>Monsters sometimes drop crystallized magic stones; those are then collected at each individual branch and sent to the headquarters.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the system that they use. So when adventurers hunt monsters, they don\u2019t only do it to protect against damages but also to become rich.</p><br/><p>A pretty good system, if you ask me.</p><br/><p>Which means that if I want to acquire some magic stones, I have to buy them\u2026</p><br/><p>So I ran into the money wall again.</p><br/><p>Thus, how should I earn some money?</p><br/><p>By myself I couldn\u2019t possibly make enough quick enough.</p><br/><p>The same with selling\u2013our fields don\u2019t produce nearly enough, and we probably couldn\u2019t sell them at a high enough price.</p><br/><p>Weapons and armors are for our personal use, and those will not be sold.</p><br/><p>So, do we have nothing to sell?</p><br/><p>The thing is, we do! I had left a certain something to Gabil, after all.</p><br/><p>Right! Hipokte grass!</p><br/><p>So I called Gabil over,</p><br/><p>\u300cGabil-kun, how is cultivation going?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu. I\u2019m glad you asked! It\u2019s going well! Literally the fruits of our labour!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, showing me their produce.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s weed\u2026</p><br/><p>Silently, I aimed \u300eBlack Lightning\u300fat him.</p><br/><p>Well, he won\u2019t die from it. I\u2019ve gotten good at adjusting the output.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuoo! What are you doing! Have I angered you somehow?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIdiot! This is common weed! What the hell have you been cultivating!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWh-what! I beg your pardon! I\u2019ve been hurrying so I seem to have mixed things up!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u201dI\u2019ve been hurrying\u201d won\u2019t cut it! Seriously.</p><br/><p>Watch what you are doing! Besides, it should be nearly impossible to grow weed in a cave with such high magic density!\u300d</p><br/><p>In reality, even this exchange was planned.</p><br/><p>We\u2019re actually steadily growing Hipokte grass.</p><br/><p>Rather, teaching Gabil to distinguish between different types of grass is what was giving me trouble.</p><br/><p>And this Gabil walks around the cave as if he owned the place, sometimes even referred to as its king.</p><br/><p>The monsters inhabiting it also flee at the sight of him.</p><br/><p>Some of his subordinates have recently been able to defeat the centipede alone, and now consider the cave as their territory.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s actually really impressive. Not that I will say that to them, or offer any praise.</p><br/><p>Gabil is the type to get carried away when praised and fail soon after. Just like me.</p><br/><p>I understand because I am the same. They have been grown a lot of hipokte grass up until now.</p><br/><p>I then called Kaijin over and showed him the hipokte grass.</p><br/><p>And next to it, the medicine I made from processing it. Quality was appraised as very good.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve always been able to produce quality medicine with it.</p><br/><p>Then, I started the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300cKaijin. If I sold this in a city, how much would I make?\u300d</p><br/><p>Kajin thought for a bit, and then replied,</p><br/><p>\u300cHmmm. Danna, that\u2019s a tough one. This medicine is too good.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s effects are too good. It\u2019s impossibly good!\u300d</p><br/><p>And then I learned a few things from him.</p><br/><p>That my medicine has the highest purity rating of 99%.</p><br/><p>That normally, the limit is 98%, and even Dwarf masters have not been able to surpass it.</p><br/><p>That even at 98%, it fetches a high price.</p><br/><p>And so on.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, if you tried selling this in a city\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019d stand out too much!\u300d</p><br/><p>An answer came from the sky.</p><br/><p>But my \u300eMagic Perception\u300fdidn\u2019t sense anyone!</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s been a while, Kajin! And, Slime. Does thou\u2026 do you remember me?\u300d</p><br/><p>While saying this, a person appeared from the sky saddled on a winged horse.</p><br/><p>A wonderful white steed with wings\u2013a Pegasus. After landing, he jumped to the ground.</p><br/><p>How could I forget\u2026 it\u2019s the dwarf King! Hero King Gazelle Dwargo himself.</p><br/><p>\u300cM-my lord! Why, eh, why would you be here?</p><br/><p>Eeeeh!!! Did You sneak out of the castle?!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaijin\u2019s opened his eyes so wide they seemed like they\u2019d fall out.</p><br/><p>Well, yeah, that\u2019s only natural. The King was alone\u2026 actually, no he brought an extra. He came with only two people!</p><br/><p>Actually, haven\u2019t I seen the other one somewhere\u2026</p><br/><p>Huh! Isn\u2019t that Bester! The dwarf that tried to ensnare us\u2026 why would he be here?</p><br/><p>\u300cFun! I slipped past a hundred guards of my own! They\u2019ve been slacking. When I return I\u2019ll retrain them!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN-no\u2026 to have a King as their training partner\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Kaijin, did you say something?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN-no! I said nothing at all!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? Okay, then!\u300d</p><br/><p>Speaking of things outside of my knowledge, the two continue their conversation.</p><br/><p>How the hell did the king slip out?!</p><br/><p>We decided to continue the conversation at a different place.</p><br/><p>And not to a temporary one, but to a special building in the center. All the administrative duties are carried out in this building.</p><br/><p>So we borrowed one of the conference rooms.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, King, what\u2019s all this about?</p><br/><p>Why did you bring Bester-dono along\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh! That\u2019s simple!</p><br/><p>I selfishly decided to forbid your future reentry into the Dwarf Kingdom.</p><br/><p>So I decided to come and see you instead.</p><br/><p>As for Bester, he\u2019s also at fault for what had occurred, so I also exiled him.</p><br/><p>But we can\u2019t have him lead a carefree life, now can we! So I brought him over.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u201dSo I brought him over\u201d! Did you really just say that?!</p><br/><p>Do you, King, truly understand?</p><br/><p>Are you planing to have Bester work here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? You don\u2019t want him?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not the problem! Aren\u2019t you worried that his knowledge will be leaked to us?\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaijin said with a deadly serious face.</p><br/><p>Though he\u2019s serious by nature, he\u2019s desperately pressing the King for answers.</p><br/><p>In contrast to him, the King casually ignores his questions. The previous dignity is nowhere to be seen; this is probably his actual appearance, huh?</p><br/><p>As for Bester, he looks completely lost.</p><br/><p>\u300cLeak\u2026 huh. When you guys left, isn\u2019t that exactly what you were doing!</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve considered erasing you, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Suddenly the King turned serious</p><br/><p>\u300cKing, that\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m serious! I decided against, it though. I try to avoid pointless effort.</p><br/><p>I brought Bester over because I would like him to work here!\u300d</p><br/><p>Those words lit a flame in Bester\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cK-King!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t get this wrong, Bester. I had high expectations of you. That much is true.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t permit you to serve me, but you can work to your heart\u2019s content here.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKing! Wouldn\u2019t that mean that they would be learning all the dwarf skills for free?\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaijin had just gotten over that, though\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cFun. \u201cIs it fine\u201d is all you guys say.</p><br/><p>With you two here, this city will become the center of technological development.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t you understand?</p><br/><p>The Dwarf Country, this King is interested in working together with you.</p><br/><p>Get it?</p><br/><p>The Dwarf Country, as of today, officially seeks to form a non-aggression treaty with you!</p><br/><p>Also, before that. As an under the table deal, we want to form Mutual Technology Research Treaty.</p><br/><p>That, however, must never be mentioned to anyone.</p><br/><p>How about it? Will you accept these two treaties?\u300d</p><br/><p>He said with a serious face looking me straight in the eye.</p><br/><p>A non aggression treaty and one to share technological advancements? What more could we ask for!</p><br/><p>They are essentially recognizing as an official state.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo does that mean you are recognizing us a country with sovereign rights?\u300d</p><br/><p>To my question,</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. It\u2019s an good offer, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Also, just out of curiosity, what is the name of this Country?\u300d</p><br/><p>Eh? A Name?</p><br/><p>Kaijin and I exchanged glances,</p><br/><p>\u300cUndecided as of yet\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNow that you mention it\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I had thought that about it once, though.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf King had decided to stay the night with us.</p><br/><p>If traveling on the Pegasus, he could return to the Dwarf Kingdom within a day.</p><br/><p>However, journeying by night is dangerous, so he decided to return the following day.</p><br/><p>We had gathered an emergency council to decide the name of the country.</p><br/><p>And thus we decided, we shall be known as the Monsters\u2019 City \u201cTempest\u201d.</p><br/><p>They had intended to call it Rimuru, but that was too embarrassing so I forbid it. We comprised down to Tempest.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like it\u2019s only my name, and it sounds alright.</p><br/><p>That night, to commemorate the naming of the city, we threw a large party.</p><br/><p>We have an abundance of food, and some pretty good cooks.</p><br/><p>Seems like we\u2019ve even been able to impress the King.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s mainly because Shuna is just such an amazing cook.</p><br/><p>For entertainment, we had a mock battle with the King.</p><br/><p>He was grumbling about how he never gets to leave the castle and such. What a surprisingly open personality he has! At this rate we\u2019ll be calling each other by name soon\u2026</p><br/><p>But a mock battle is no good. Is what I thought. But he wouldn\u2019t listen.</p><br/><p>Seems like he\u2019s planning something.</p><br/><p>But I have no choice, I\u2019ll play along.</p><br/><p>I transformed into my human form.</p><br/><p>Since eating the Orc Disaster, my human form grew a bit.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m no longer a child, but a young girl. Around 150 cm in height. A bit more accomplished, maybe?</p><br/><p>Taking wooden swords in hand, we face each other.</p><br/><p>Hakurou observed the match, and called for it to start.</p><br/><p>\u300cBegin!\u300d</p><br/><p>That very moment, the King disappeared. Escaping my perception completely.</p><br/><p>Dangerous! The moment I thought that, the wooden sword I held was hit out of my hand.</p><br/><p>The match was decided. I completely lost.</p><br/><p>So this is the Dwarf King\u2026 the power of the hero king!</p><br/><p>\u300cListen, Rimuru. From the very beginning you didn\u2019t notice me approaching from the sky, did you?</p><br/><p>Though Magic Perception is a wonderful skill, but there are countless ways to slip outside of its sight.</p><br/><p>I anticipated what perception method you would use, and slipped past it.</p><br/><p>These are the basics of war! Concentrate harder.

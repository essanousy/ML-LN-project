Meeting in the Labyrinth</p><br/><p>Armoured Corps chief Calgurio advanced his troops with the utmost confidence.</p><br/><p>After consulting with his advisors, a magic tank squad was to advance as vanguard and bait.</p><br/><p>Even if Storm Dragon Veldora appeared, the Aerial Fighter Legion\u2019s 100 airship fleet would counter it flawlessly.</p><br/><p>That force was thought to be more that enough to conquer all of the west side.</p><br/><p>After all, the 100 airships assured complete dominance by each carrying elite mages to the maximum capacity.</p><br/><p>In addition, even though the 300 airships carrying the Beast Corps did not have many offensive mages, they specialized in logistic support so it was not a problem.</p><br/><p>With both teams simultaneously attacking, Calgurio\u2019s Armored Corps would achieve great success and honor.</p><br/><p>Thus, Calgurio laughed heartily at the prospect of his power further increasing in the Empire.</p><br/><p>As the enemy fell for the bait, the main force was to boldly make its appearance and commence the attack.</p><br/><p>Even though they were at the border of the military nation of Dwargon, their movements would not be detected.</p><br/><p>It was also not guaranteed that this nation would contact its allied nation, the Monster Country Tempest.</p><br/><p>In any case, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>Even if they were to send troops now, they were too far, and timewise, would not be able to make it.</p><br/><p>Even if they were too busy with their experiments and regretted it, it would be too late.</p><br/><p>(TN: I don\u2019t know. Original: \u306b\u3063\u305f\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u308c\u306a\u306e\u3060\u3002)</p><br/><p>Plus, even if they were guarding all routes, they would be spread far too thin to actually be a hindrance.</p><br/><p>Everything was going according to plan, victory was in Calgurio\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>At that point, on the off chance that the military nation Dwargon tried to help the Monster\u2019s Country Tempest, their neutrality is nulled.</p><br/><p>If that happened, he would then overwhelm and destroy both nations.</p><br/><p>-</p><br/><p>Then, a well awaited report came.</p><br/><p>The vanguard squad sent as bait reported that, the monsters of Tempest had come out.</p><br/><p>They number not much more than ten thousand.</p><br/><p>The report verified that it was one the enemy\u2019s main forces.</p><br/><p>I won!</p><br/><p>Gloated Calgurio.</p><br/><p>The enemy easily fell for the trap.</p><br/><p>They seem to be much less intelligent than he thought, and, failing to guess his invasion route, split up their forces.</p><br/><p>Reconnaissance had determined that Monster Country Tempest, had prepared 120,000 \u2013 150,000 troops.</p><br/><p>Among them, those that could be considered military units should not even be 50,000.</p><br/><p>Therefore, as the enemy here number around 10,000, their plan was likely to have all the routes covered and stall for time.</p><br/><p>With such a pathetic force, forget stalling for time, even the vanguard can finish them off.</p><br/><p>As expected of savages, monsters that do not comprehend the importance of information gathering, this was their utmost level of planning.</p><br/><p>If Veldora doesn\u2019t appear, they are fated for defeat.</p><br/><p>Before the frontal forces arrive to trample all over them, Calgurio would quickly fell the enemy base.</p><br/><p>Calgurio ordered to halt covert operations and advanced his army towards the capital of Monster Country Tempest.</p><br/><p>Although there is the matter of the dwarves possibly taking military action, that was determined to no longer be a problem.</p><br/><p>In fact, Calgurio was immersed in imagining the faces of the of the panicked enemy as they finally noticed his army.</p><br/><p>In the end, with no sign of reinforcement from Dwargon, they would head for the Labyrinth in the Monster Country Tempest\u2019s satellite city.</p><br/><p>They beasts most likely gave up upon seeing the Empire\u2019s might, thought Calgurio.</p><br/><p>That was obvious, after all, the Empire boasts a great army of 700,000.</p><br/><p>In addition, despite being fully armed, they marched are an unprecedented speed.</p><br/><p>This modern army was at a strength beyond the imagination of the dwarves with their backdated technology and arms.</p><br/><p>Magic and science.</p><br/><p>With their fusion, based on a new cutting edge combat system, the strongest corps was born.</p><br/><p>That was the Armoured Corps led by Calgurio.</p><br/><p>-</p><br/><p>In Monster Country Tempest, at the location of the Labyrinth city was nothing save for a single structure.</p><br/><p>That, in fact, was the entrance to the Labyrinth, and other than a staircase to its depths, there was nothing more in the vicinity.</p><br/><p>This scene was different from what was initially reported, and apparently, the merchants and adventurers on the west side all ran away with the Empire approaching.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, rather than let the enemy use them, it was likely that the beasts erased everything.</p><br/><p>They probably feared the possibility of looting.</p><br/><p>This in reality was a clearly a strategy to hurt the enemy by preventing the enemy from procuring food.</p><br/><p>(Clever!)</p><br/><p>Calgurio spits out.</p><br/><p>For soldiers who received enhancement surgery from \u2018Otherworld\u2019 science and magic, it is possible to perform optimally without food or water for a week.</p><br/><p>Food packs made with energy balance in mind were created to provide each unit with energy for a single day.</p><br/><p>Each unit, carrying a small storage pack, was provided 10 such food packs.</p><br/><p>Considering such measures taken prior to arriving, there was no loss in performance in the Armoured Corps even if they could not manage to collect food from this town.</p><br/><p>Food intake was optimized by making sufficiently small and easy to use food packs.</p><br/><p>The problem of potable water was easily solved by drawing water through magic.</p><br/><p>To hope that the supply chain was a weakness of this great army was simply too na\u00efve.</p><br/><p>(Ha! Demon lord or not, in the end, to think they\u2019re only capable of such shallow thought!)</p><br/><p>Ridiculing the plans of his foe, Calgurio was certain of victory on this battle.</p><br/><p>First he would put a foothold in the satellite city of Monster Country Tempest.</p><br/><p>Building a base there, he would subjugate the west side with a smooth flow.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t hurry, the Beast Corps advancing from the north would diminish the scale of his achievement.</p><br/><p>If Veldora were to come out, there would be the need to stop it, but the Storm Dragon had made no sign of showing up.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>While Calgurio was resting in a tent of the provisional headquarters, he was surprised to not receive any reports from the vanguard.</p><br/><p>After the first time, there was no more communication.</p><br/><p>According to the communications mage, the magic concentration in the Great Forest of Jura was apparently interfering with the magic communication waves.</p><br/><p>As this is a demon lord\u2019s domain, that much was to be expected.</p><br/><p>The remaining enemy troops may have even come back and fighting had already broke out.</p><br/><p>(Even so, judging from the first troops we encountered, reinforcements should also be fodder.)</p><br/><p>There was no need to worry about the vanguard, so Calgurio would stopped thinking about it.</p><br/><p>Just in case, he ordered an Reconnaissance to look into the matter and dropped the thought.</p><br/><p>-</p><br/><p>The issue now: Whether to advance to the capital or the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Normally, felling the capital would be given priority.</p><br/><p>It was close by, so first was defeat the demon lord and then, beat the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Even if Veldora showed up, it\u2019s a simple matter of calling the Airship fleet.</p><br/><p>Though communication was impossible for now, they could easily signal them using magic bullets.</p><br/><p>Unlike on land, airspeed was so high that the waiting time would be negligible, so there was no need to fear the purportedly weakened Storm Dragon.</p><br/><p>The mage reported that, the Monster Country Tempest\u2019s capital had a defence barrier set up around it.</p><br/><p>Even using the Magic Canceller Device to break the barrier, it would soon regenerate, so there was no point.</p><br/><p>It seemed to be pretty strong. Rather than breaking in, it would seem to be easier to destroy it from the inside.</p><br/><p>Even though the Magic Canceller Device was excellent against offensive magic, its rather weak at beating barriers.</p><br/><p>That being the case, now would be the time that the remodelled Armoured Corps takes center stage.</p><br/><p>Reconnaissance reported that the monster troops were stationed right in front of the capital.</p><br/><p>They were the main force of 20,000 high orcs.</p><br/><p>No problem at all.</p><br/><p>Calgurio and his advisors all never doubted their certain victory.</p><br/><p>After all, they had a great army of 700,000.</p><br/><p>Victory usually being assured with 3 times the force, with more that 30 times more troops, they had no doubt at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just attack both places at the same time?\u201d</p><br/><p>The advisors who were nobles of the Empire expressed the opinion.</p><br/><p>There were no objections.</p><br/><p>There was no need to pointlessly disagree and create anxiety, as there was no rush.</p><br/><p>Rather, Calgurio was equally interested in the treasures that lay within the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>In the end, sending off 200,000 troops to capture the capital, he, with 350,000 were to head into the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it was a simple strategy of overwhelming the labyrinth with immense numbers.</p><br/><p>There being no objections, there\u2019s really no doubt that what they were most interested in was the short-term profit, rather than capturing the capital but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Being assured of victory, Calgurio and co. put their plan to action without realizing their greed.</p><br/><p>Thus, in Monster Country Tempest, 200,000 troops would advance towards the capital, and 350,000 would focus on capturing the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>These foolish souls would descent the stairs they could never again climb back up.</p><br/><p>With the absolute conviction of filling their pockets to the brim with the treasures of the Labyrinth, they advanced.</p><br/><p>The Labyrinth grants passage to all.</p><br/><p>But, with Safe Mode now turned off, there would be a never before seen hell befallen on its visitors.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>One of the innermost rooms of the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>A place where a secret meeting room could be found, that even Rimuru didn\u2019t know of.</p><br/><p>For the first time, because of the Master of the Labyrinth, Ramiris\u2019 emergency remodelling, the most powerful denizens of the Labyrinth were gathered.</p><br/><p>The reason: a meeting concerning the annihilation of the fools who dared to invade the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>But in reality, the purpose of the meeting was of a very different nature.</p><br/><p>-</p><br/><p>The gathered, they were those who were called the 10 Lords of the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Ramiris\u2019 aide, Labyrinth janitor, dungeon master Beretta.</p><br/><p>4 groups of the Lords.</p><br/><p>Floor 90 guardian, Nine-head-kumara.</p><br/><p>Floor 80 guardian, Insect Emperor Kaiser Zegion.</p><br/><p>Floor 79 floor boss, Insect Queen Apito.</p><br/><p>Floor 70 guardian, Ghost King, Immortal King Adalman.</p><br/><p>Floor 70 vanguard, Ghost Knight, Death Paladin Albert.</p><br/><p>And finally,</p><br/><p>Floor 50 alternating guardians, Gozurl and Mezurl.</p><br/><p>Both of them were also participating for some reason.</p><br/><p>Realizing the strength of their fellow Lords, it felt as if they were shrinking.</p><br/><p>They, who had thought they could win against anyone, now faced a reality as they recognized the clear difference in level.</p><br/><p>As for Beretta, though he was only assigned to chores said \u2013 Later, Rune Master Gadra would become one of the 10 Lords \u2013 but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Anyway, those sitting down currently were the 10 Lords of the Labyrinth. </p><br/><p>Knowing that irresponsible Ramiris, that name would not stick.</p><br/><p>Normally, all of them wouldn\u2019t gather here, but since it was an emergency-like situation, Ramiris invoked her authority, and as a result, for the first time, the whole team had gathered.</p><br/><p>Well, Veldora was sitting leisurely on the middle seat but, the other Lords were gathered for a sole reason.</p><br/><p>That who amongst them, other than Beretta and the Storm Dragon, was the strongest.</p><br/><p>This rivalry burned stronger when Demon Lord Rimuru personally praised Alderman and granted him a higher rank.</p><br/><p>Every one of them wanted to prove to be the most useful.</p><br/><p>With the lower floors not receiving much action, those Lords were most affected.</p><br/><p>So there was a backlash.</p><br/><p>Particularly the 2 females, Apito and Kumara, had an dangerous relationship.</p><br/><p>Zegion was calm, and Alderman was burning with ambition.</p><br/><p>However, they did not truly hate each other despite their poisonous auras.</p><br/><p>In the end, even though they were all aiming to prove themselves, they wouldn\u2019t go around sabotaging each other\u2019s efforts.</p><br/><p>These people gathered for the first time, but it was surprisingly quiet.</p><br/><p>Facing the Empire\u2019s invasion of the Labyrinth, their hostility towards the enemy took precedence over their rivalry.</p><br/><p>\u201cLords, you\u2019ve done well to gather!</p><br/><p>Today, this Labyrinth faces its greatest crisis since it\u2019s grand opening!</p><br/><p>With that, let me hear your thoughts!\u201d</p><br/><p>The words my Ramiris signaled the start of the meeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra? Isn\u2019t that obvious-\u201d (TN: kumara ends her line in -orin su)</p><br/><p>\u201c- a Massacre of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cutting off Kumara, Apito continues.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, can you not send the action to my floor?</p><br/><p>These days, Apito has been happy fooling around with the Holy Knight right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay what! That weakling, any more and I\u2019ll die of boredom!\u201d</p><br/><p>As they glare at each other, a different kind of tension fills the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhahahahaha! Lets stop the bickering. And be at ease.</p><br/><p>This time, everyone shall get a chance to fight!</p><br/><p>First, I figured anyone who can pass the 60th floor</p><br/><p>would be a worthy enemy but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It was annoying so I stopped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea that\u2019s right! Just like Shishou (TN: Master) said, waiting for them to cross all the 50 floors is seriously a pain -ne?</p><br/><p>Normally it\u2019d be ok, but with their numbers, it looks like it\u2019s gonna take a while.</p><br/><p>So tell you what, well send in 10,000 of \u2018em to each floor from the beginning.</p><br/><p>If you\u2019re lucky, someone strong might come along in y\u2019know?\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words from Veldora and Ramiris, the others\u2019 shown a glint in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you mean\u2026\u2026 everyone gets the chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Asks Alderman, to which,</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris made an exaggerated nod, and continued with the explanation.</p><br/><p>Each of the Lords would receive 10,000 troops at a time.</p><br/><p>Floors 61 \u2013 70, 71 \u2013 80 and 81-90 would get filled 100,000 each.</p><br/><p>And the remaining would be sent to floors 51 \u2013 60.</p><br/><p>There were around 350,000 troops heading into the Labyrinth, so they would be distributed in this fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, Gozurl and Mezurl are on standby on floor 30 to eat up the ones that can run back up that far \u2018kay?</p><br/><p>And even if you up and die, you can always revive so, work hard -ne!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris concluded.</p><br/><p>With that, the Lords got super motivated.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, does Rimuru-sama know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zegion broke his silence and spoke.</p><br/><p>And Apito was surprised.</p><br/><p>Insect Emperor Kaiser Zegion was a silent man, he never really had much to talk about.</p><br/><p>he seemed to be receiving combat training from Veldora for a while, and recently it looked like they were close to being evenly matched.</p><br/><p>Veldora was admittedly very strong, and other than his loyalty to Demon Lord Rimuru, He was a man who only cared for strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe, we\u2019re keeping it a secret! So, lets surprise everyone -ne!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris said with an innocent smile.</p><br/><p>But in reality, together with Veldora the two were hatching a devious plot \u2013 mainly to surprise Rimuru --</p><br/><p>It was always like that, and the one\u2019s who were involved suffered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi oi, Rimuru-sama won\u2019t get angry later right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Albert asked, worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problemo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora and Ramiris assured him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Beretta was averting his gaze, Albert gave up.</p><br/><p>Well, it probably wasn\u2019t too big a deal, he thought.</p><br/><p>I just need to beat the enemy.</p><br/><p>In theory, a battered enemy is easier to beat, but we can revive.</p><br/><p>There was no need for wait for them to tire out battling monsters on weaker floors.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, I concur that we simply need to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zegion said with a nod, and the matter was settled.</p><br/><p>Ramiris and Veldora looked at each other with an evil smile, and the others pretended not to notice.</p><br/><p>After all, it was the first real battle with the full force.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, in truth, none of them were going to let go of this chance.</p><br/><p>To unleash the true horror of the Labyrinth unto its invaders, the ten Lords returned to their respective floors.</p><br/><p>And so, these denizens of hell wait patiently for their soon to arrive guests.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

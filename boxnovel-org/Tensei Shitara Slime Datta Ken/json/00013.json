Some things came up, and pushed my schedule back eight or so hours. I\u2019ll try to post chapter 18 within the next 12 hours.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Corner (Cast: an English Clown and a French Pierrot)</p><br/><p>Pierrot: That Rimuru\u2026 \u201cLooking down on monsters is thinking you\u2019ve become strong and acting high and mighty\u201d what a hypocrite!</p><br/><p>Clown: Now, now. Rimuru had always been very humble about Rimuru\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: I know. I just found it hilarious.</p><br/><p>Clown: I never can understand your sense of humor. But that be as it may, what\u2019s next?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Next, they are going to make the trip to the dwarf kingdom!</p><br/><p>Clown: I mean in our story.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: We have a story? Should we add characters?</p><br/><p>Clown: \u2026 we haven\u2019t even properly developed the ones we have!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Oh, but we have! You just haven\u2019t realized it yet, foolish Clown. There is a big mystery about the Clown/Pierrot duo.</p><br/><p>Clown: What is it?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: So the daily joke:</p><br/><p>Clown: Hey!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Hillary Clinton goes to a psychic who tells her: \u201cPrepare yourself for widowhood \u2026 Your husband is about to die a violent death.\u201d Mrs. Clinton takes a deep breath and replies: \u201cWill I be acquitted?\u201d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Empowerment Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 13 \u2013 To the Dwarf Kingdom</p><br/><p>As Rigurdo had declared, the preparations were complete by noon.</p><br/><p>Choosing the expedition party was also uneventful.</p><br/><p>Rigudo\u2019s son Riguru was in the top five candidates. Of course, Ranga came along.</p><br/><p>Oh, oh! Should I make Riguru the commanding officer?</p><br/><p>I was a little uneasy about it, but he himself agreed.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo also seems to have regained his youthful vigor, so maybe I worry too much.</p><br/><p>And so, after I had picked up the baggage, Ranga had me get on his back.</p><br/><p>*Boyoyooon!* I was buried in his fur.</p><br/><p>And while the surrounding fur seems to have secured me in place, I still feel the need to use [Sticky Thread].</p><br/><p>It\u2019s times like this that make me regret not having arms or legs, but I guess I can manage with abilities.</p><br/><p>You see, I secretly practice manipulating the string.</p><br/><p>To defeat an enemy with a web! Isn\u2019t that every man\u2019s dream?</p><br/><p>Whether I\u2019ll be able to learn those techniques, I do not know; but I decided to keep practicing regardless!</p><br/><p>That aside, the baggage held our money and provisions.</p><br/><p>Food enough for three days.</p><br/><p>If the trip takes longer, the plan is to hunt the rest of the way.</p><br/><p>We could have taken more, but I\u2019d rather avoid bringing a caravan worth of food.</p><br/><p>Well, I could carry nearly an infinite amount inside of me\u2026</p><br/><p>But spoiling them is a bad idea.</p><br/><p>Since I do not eat anyways, that was my decision.</p><br/><p>For currency, we brought 7 silver and 24 bronze coins.</p><br/><p>Which, of course, is a meager amount.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t expect much.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s not enough\u2026 we\u2019ll figure that out later.</p><br/><p>Now then, time to go!</p><br/><p>At a goblin\u2019s pace, the trip to the Dwarf Kingdom takes about two months.</p><br/><p>\u201cThrough the forest runs the vast Ameld River.</p><br/><p>Beyond it, a mountain range reveals itself.</p><br/><p>And it is in those mountains that you will find the Dwarf Kingdom.\u201d They said.</p><br/><p>Other than by the Empire to the east, the Jura forest is surrounded by many countries.</p><br/><p>And yet bordering no state, stands the Canaat Mountain Range.</p><br/><p>Thus, there are only three trade routes leading to them.</p><br/><p>One goes right through the Jura forest.</p><br/><p>Another, the harder, traverses the mountains.</p><br/><p>The last is a sea route.</p><br/><p>Currently, the Jura forest route is by far the shortest and the safest, but, for some reason, it\u2019s generally avoided.</p><br/><p>And so, the harder mountain route had been the norm.</p><br/><p>As for the sea route, the cost and the powerful sea monsters steer sailors away; thus, it is the least used route.</p><br/><p>For now, we have no business with the Empire.</p><br/><p>Thus, rather than heading east, we headed north to the mountains.</p><br/><p>Nor do we need to ascend to the mountain summit.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf Kingdom spreads all the way to the Ameld River.</p><br/><p>Their capital is a beautiful city carved inside a natural giant cave.</p><br/><p>Such is the Dwarf Kingdom.</p><br/><p>So as intended, we continued north along the Ameld river.</p><br/><p>Since following the river prevents us from getting lost. Though just to be safe, I have opened the map in my head.</p><br/><p>As for our guide\u2013he was sent as a messenger to the kingdom before, so we left it to him.</p><br/><p>But man\u2026 the black wolves (storm fang wolves) are fast! And show no signs of getting tired.</p><br/><p>Since we started the journey three hours ago, they have yet to take a break. And let\u2019s not forget to mention their 80 kph (50 mph) running speed.</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t even care about the uneven terrain, and while running in a way as to prevent motion sickness!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s unnaturally comfortable, to say the least.</p><br/><p>At this pace, this probably won\u2019t even take a week.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s no need to rush. Certainly I want to figure out the clothing and housing problem soon, but it\u2019s fine if it takes some time.</p><br/><p>\u300cOooooi! You don\u2019t need to push yourselves this much!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what I called out.</p><br/><p>But for some reason, the speed increased.</p><br/><p>At first I thoroughly enjoyed the breeze generated by these faster-than-a-motorcycle wolves, but that got boring soon.</p><br/><p>More so considering that it\u2019s difficult to have your words heard at this speed, but I have [Telepathic Communication]!</p><br/><p>Might be good to continue the journey with a conversation.</p><br/><p>So I connected to their thought network.</p><br/><p>What will I hear\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u300cRiguru-kun. I always wondered, who named your brother?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! Though for someone like me, don\u2019t bother with honorifics! As for my brother\u2019s name, he said a traveling man from devil race named him.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? A devil named a goblin?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, though this happened more than a decade ago. I was but a child then\u2026 but they say he stayed a few days and was pleased with my brother. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHeh\u2026. Must have been a good brother.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! I was very proud of him. To the point of saying \u201cI want to one day serve under Devil Gelmudo-sama, too!\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe devil didn\u2019t take your brother with him?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. Brother was still young, but he departed with a promise to come back when I got stronger. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so. Wouldn\u2019t he be surprised if he sees the village now!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCertainly! However, I now serve Rimuru-sama. No matter how glorious the Demon Lord\u2019s army is, I can no longer join Gelmudo-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Demon Lord\u2019s army\u2026? I think I\u2019ve heard of them. But never mind that, how come you believe him?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs you say. But whether it was faith or conviction, I don\u2019t know. Though my brother received a name from the devil, he didn\u2019t evolve to this extent.</p><br/><p>Clearly, the degree of evolution is different. Never expected to hear the \u201cVoice of World\u201d in my entire life!\u300d</p><br/><p>The surrounding hobgoblins would only join in with a \u201cThat\u2019 right!\u201d-kind of phrase.</p><br/><p>Is it really as he says?</p><br/><p>When you receive a name, you evolve. And, the evolution depends on the power of the giver\u2026</p><br/><p>If I get a chance to experiment, I\u2019ll try it out.</p><br/><p>More important: Demon Lord\u2019s army.</p><br/><p>It actually exists in this world!</p><br/><p>Will the Demon Lord come to recruit us? \u2026 which side should we support???</p><br/><p>That thought I\u2019ll leave for when he comes.</p><br/><p>In any case, a \u201cHero\u201d also exists, and if anyone should fight the demon lord, it\u2019d be her.</p><br/><p>Though whether she is still alive after 300 years is a good question\u2026 She probably reincarnated a bunch of times by now, and now trains in peace.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s make a mental note regarding this.</p><br/><p>Now then, the next conversation is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cRanga! Aren\u2019t I your father\u2019s nemesis? Are you okay with staying by my side?\u300d</p><br/><p>Is how I asked the black wolves.</p><br/><p>\u300cHonestly, that thought had never crossed my mind.</p><br/><p>However, the fate of monsters naturally rests on the outcome of battle.</p><br/><p>Thus regardless of the war, the winner proclaims his justice.</p><br/><p>The loser looses all\u2026</p><br/><p>And so\u2026 I, who had begin forgiven by You, my liege, and have even been bestowed a name! I feel but gratitude towards You!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so\u2026 well, if you ever desire revenge, come at my any time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu. Since evolving, I can think more clearly. And unlike during the battle, now I know. If You had faced us seriously, we would have been massacred!</p><br/><p>And our dearest wish, to evolve, would have crumbled like house of sand.</p><br/><p>Our eternal loyalty belongs to no other!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Seriously, this guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Yes, had I mimicked the black serpent, I could have laid waste to all living things, but I didn\u2019t want to resort to that.</p><br/><p>Ranga holds too high of an opinion of me.</p><br/><p>Well, not that his misconceptions hurt me in any way.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo you understand\u2026 You have grown.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI am unworthy of such praise!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus the conversation ended with a nod.</p><br/><p>However, I did kill his parent. No way I\u2019ll believe that he holds no grudge.</p><br/><p>If Ranga ever does come for revenge, I\u2019ll gladly face him.</p><br/><p>Until then, he just needs to grow stronger.</p><br/><p>Right now, no matter how I look at him, he\u2019s at most as strong as the black serpent.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s how we continued our journey.</p><br/><p>Thus, without getting attacked by monsters or other incident, we comfortable continued on our way.</p><br/><p>Every three hours, we\u2019d take a thirty minute break. After fourteen hours, we\u2019d take seven to sleep.</p><br/><p>I did say, \u201caren\u2019t we rushing too much?\u201d, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWe are fine! Due to evolving, this much can hardly tire us!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus answered Riguru,</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease do not worry regarding us! Unlike You, our liege, we do require sleep, but not many hours!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, we do not require frequent meals, and will not weaken when lacking them!\u300d</p><br/><p>And so added Ranga.</p><br/><p>Looking at others, their words seem to prove true.</p><br/><p>At this rate, the one who does the least\u2013me, seems to whine the most.</p><br/><p>Well, if everyone is fine with it, I guess we can continue at this pace.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll be running twelve hours a day\u2026 aren\u2019t these guys tough.</p><br/><p>And on the evening of the second day, while having dinner,</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Gobuta. How much farther is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>Introducing Goblin Gobuta!</p><br/><p>\u300cI am happy that you ask this unworthy one!!! Please pardon me should I be mistaken, but we should reach them by tomorrow! Th mountain is close by!\u300d</p><br/><p>Seems like being asked by me made him both nervous and happy at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t bite his tongue, did he?\u201d That\u2019s how nervous he seemed.</p><br/><p>But indeed, most of the mountain is now in sight.</p><br/><p>Compared to not seeing it at all yesterday\u2013what terrifying speed we travel at!</p><br/><p>On that note\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, and I know it\u2019s a sudden question, but why did you travel to the Dwarf Kingdom? Shouldn\u2019t their merchants stop by once in a while?\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked that question.</p><br/><p>When I asked Rigurdo about the goblin \u201ccountry\u201d, he also discussed something about Kobold traders.</p><br/><p>So what could have prompted them to make this two month journey?</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! It was about magic weapons and armor. Dwarfs tend to buy them at a high price! We were paid in equipment\u2026 so we helped the peddlers bring it back!</p><br/><p>And besides, not one of us could use that equipment\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>So they sometimes sold the equipment carried by adventurers.</p><br/><p>And thus, they were left without appropriate equipment.</p><br/><p>Yet they sold it to Kobolds who couldn\u2019t even properly estimate its value.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the goblins could kill a lost beginner, at most.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t expect them to have gotten their hands on anything good\u2026</p><br/><p>But who\u2019d expect the dwarfs to make goblin armor\u2026 they may be a surprisingly kind race.</p><br/><p>Hopefully, we\u2019ll proceed on friendly terms.</p><br/><p>Actually, let\u2019s just form a partnership!</p><br/><p>Thus,</p><br/><p>Since we started the journey, three days had passed.</p><br/><p>The beautiful city carved within the mountain range.</p><br/><p>Wrought by nature, the natural fortress.</p><br/><p>The Warrior Country Dwargon.</p><br/><p>We had reached the Dwarf Kingdom</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: the Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Titles: One who Commands Monsters</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Skills: Unique Skill [Great Sage], Unique Skill [Predator], Slime-Specific Skills [Dissolve, Absorb, Regenerate], Extra Skill [Water Manipulation], Extra Skill [Magic Perception], Acquired Skills: Black Serpent [Heat Detection, Noxious Breath], Centipede [Paralysis Breath], Spider [Sticky Thread, Steel Threat], Bat [Ultrasound Waves], Lizard [Body Armor], Wolf [Supreme Sense of Smell, Telepathic Communication, Coercion]</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance EX, Physical Attack Resistance, Pain Resistance, Electricity Resistance, Paralysis Resistance</p><br/>\n</div>"}

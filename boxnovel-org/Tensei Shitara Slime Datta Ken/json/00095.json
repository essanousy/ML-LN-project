To Rimuru\u2019s ability, Wisdom King Raphael.)</p><br/><p>Shizu-san says so, while smiling gently.</p><br/><p>The Izawa Shizue who was seen by Hinata and I was not the real person.</p><br/><p>It was the remains of the real person\u2019s Soul. A fragment of her mind.</p><br/><p>At the time I absorbed her, her soul was also taken. Thanks to the evolution of Wisdom King Raphael, it seems that the analysis of her soul was a success.</p><br/><p>Really.........</p><br/><p>Since the time it was still \u2018Great Sage\u2019, what has it done secretly and silently behind me? This fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t the true Mastermind Wisdom King Raphael-san? I thought so too, but it might also not be true.</p><br/><p>Inside the constructed thought space, Hinata was being embraced by Shizu-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have done well\u201d, Shizu-san said while praising Hinata.</p><br/><p>That ruthless Hinata had a relieved expression like a child. Seeing such an appearance I felt a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>Then, Shizu-san\u2019s hands plucked the wicked insect that was coiling around Hinata\u2019s head, and burnt it completely with her flame.</p><br/><p>That was, the \u201cCurse\u2019s Crystal\u201d that had started Hinata\u2019s Thought Restraint [1].</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, hey! Wisdom King Raphael. I also met Yuuki, could I also be under Thought Restraint?\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t think so, I asked to make sure.</p><br/><p>This Wisdom King Raphael fellow maybe doing something without permission, but it was not a negligent fellow.</p><br/><p>\u300aNotification. Master is not under Thought Restraint.</p><br/><p>However, the traces of Thought Guidance were confirmed.</p><br/><p>Because of the ability\u2019s evolution, the effect of Thought Guidance has disappeared now.</p><br/><p>The report came nonchalantly from Raphael as if it was a trivial matter.</p><br/><p>This fellow, if there were signs, then the probability that Yuuki was the mastermind was high.</p><br/><p>Even I was not convinced to doubt at that level! This fellow (Raphael), really.......</p><br/><p>Oh well, perhaps to obtain definitive evidence, it attempted to reproduce Shizu-san\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>This fellow was too much of a perfectionist, it won\u2019t report to me, if the information was not absolutely 100% correct.</p><br/><p>Since my analysis was imperfect, it will trouble and confuse me, if it reported every trivial information one by one.</p><br/><p>As if it understood what my intentions were, I don\u2019t have any complaint about it.</p><br/><p>And thus, time passed for a while.</p><br/><p>Hinata raised her head, did she calm down?</p><br/><p>Her expression was calm, her previous tense mood had been eased.</p><br/><p>Perhaps she was actually a kind child, but she might have acquired her ruthless and brutal tendency to survive through the harsh world.</p><br/><p>If you think about it, was this what Shizu-san had regrets about?</p><br/><p>Maybe for this reason, Wisdom King Raphael reproduced Shizu-san\u2019s Soul, because it wanted an opportunity to exchange information with her.</p><br/><p>(Hinata, I\u2019m sorry for neglecting you.</p><br/><p>Please live strongly, faith is important, but don\u2019t misjudge the reality/enemy.)[2]</p><br/><p>\u300cShishou (Sensei).........But, even now, I am still confused.</p><br/><p>I believe the condition in Holy Empire of Ruberion was not wrong.\u300d(Hinata)</p><br/><p>(Hinata...... Which is correct? Which is wrong?</p><br/><p>To decide it one-sidedly is not good. Be flexible, okay?)</p><br/><p>Shizu-san admonishes her gently.</p><br/><p>She still wanted to talk more. This woman (Hinata) even if she was smart, she was too stubborn.</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t really lend her ear to any of my words, but there are occasions when she showed her flexible nature.</p><br/><p>But just as expected she still didn\u2019t listen to my words......</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand. One more time, I will start over. Seeing with these eyes, and deciding with my own heart.\u300d (Hinata)</p><br/><p>Hinata nodded honestly.</p><br/><p>Oi......... was it because Shizu-san\u2019s the one who was talking that she became this obedient? Or, because she was released from Thought Restraint that she became obedient?</p><br/><p>It was because of the Thought Restraint. Yes, there\u2019s no mistaking it.</p><br/><p>After all, it\u2019s not like I expected anything while having a hard time persuading Hinata.</p><br/><p>That means, the bad one was all Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Was there a possibility that guy was also manipulated....?</p><br/><p>Could Raphael give me an answer about this?</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, I understand that Kagurazaka Yuuki is the mastermind. But, for confirmation....</p><br/><p>Is there a possibility that Yuuki is also being manipulated?</p><br/><p>If I say accurately, by the \u201cSorcery King (Curse Lord)\u201d Kazaream!\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>I press the question about the real issue at hand sternly.</p><br/><p>If it is not inquired now, the core issue may never come out.</p><br/><p>\u300cYuuki is manipulated by \u201cSorcery King\u201d Kazaream, how?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he a former Demon Lord that was slain by Demon Lord Leon, right? How can he still be alive?\u300d(Hinata)</p><br/><p>\u300cNn? Ah! Before this, that person\u2019s subordinate Clayman said that Demon Lord was still alive.</p><br/><p>He said that person\u2019s Spiritual body seemed to have revived.</p><br/><p>Because he had detailed information from the human side, I guessed that he was possessing a human.\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300cHe is alive? And, he is in a place where he could gather information easily.</p><br/><p> In the first place, to apply Thought Restraint on me, it doesn\u2019t seem possible for Yuuki to do it at the same time when I arrived at this world.</p><br/><p>Above all else, his intention or objective was unknown. But, if you say that Kazaream is the mastermind.....\u300d (Hinata)</p><br/><p>\u300cNn? Do you know something?\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>To my question, Hinata only replied in silence.</p><br/><p>This fellow was still not being honest with me.</p><br/><p>Oh well. What I wanted to hear was not from Hinata.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnswer me, Wisdom King Raphael\u300d</p><br/><p>To my question, I felt relieved as if it was answered.</p><br/><p>A Spiritual body can\u2019t use their ability excessively. Additionally, there was a possibility that it could possess a body and move from one to another.</p><br/><p>Or, there was a possibility that somehow, through the protection of the Spiritual body, the soul did not vanish. Kazaream was left roaming around and fused with Yuuki when he accidently came into this world.</p><br/><p>Although the probability of the former was higher, the communication with Clayman came too slowly. As Clayman said, the contact suddenly came several tens of years ago [3], until then his movement was a mystery.</p><br/><p>In case of the latter.</p><br/><p>The probability was too low, it was something unimaginable, but..... There was a dying person who reincarnated as a Slime, so it can\u2019t be said to be completely impossible.</p><br/><p>Eh? Wasn\u2019t that was about myself?! I let out such a Tsukkomi.</p><br/><p>If one can\u2019t be said with certainty, Kaguzaka Yuuki\u2019s personality might have already vanished or not.</p><br/><p>However, there was also a possibility that Yuuki\u2019s personality could have been swallowed or dominated by Kazaream.</p><br/><p>Wisdom King Raphael considered various possibilities, but it doesn\u2019t want to declare until there was certainty.</p><br/><p>Since its perfectionist nature could be considered a merit and a demerit.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnyway, currently without any doubt, Yuuki is a dangerous opponent. Because of that, we must be cautious.\u300d</p><br/><p>So, I concluded.</p><br/><p>(However, that child was seen as a really normal and kind child. There was no uncomfortable feeling.</p><br/><p>That was why I worried about him, Hinata. You must never get close to Yuuki.</p><br/><p>I have a very unpleasant premonition........</p><br/><p>Good bye, Hinata. Please live and become happy)</p><br/><p>Shizu-san said so at the end, she then disappeared from Hinata and my sight.</p><br/><p>She was finally able to tell Hinata what she was worried about, what she regretted had she disappeared.</p><br/><p>After Shizu-san disappearance, Hinata kept offering a silent prayer towards that direction. That appearance, I will always remember it.</p><br/><p>And then......</p><br/><p>\u300aNotification. The purpose was achieved. Now releasing the thought link\u300b</p><br/><p>Immediately after it said that, I felt like I was wrapped in a bright light.</p><br/><p>(Rimuru, thank you about Hinata. As expected you really are a kind person...... This place is very comfortable.....)</p><br/><p>I thought I heard Shizu-san\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Was it only my imagination? Or, was it an illusion? However, Shizu-san\u2019s anxiety certainly disappeared.</p><br/><p>While sprouting a gentle smile, Shizu-san bowed her head to me.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>I opened my eyes after the signal from Wisdom King Raphael.</p><br/><p>The time that had been prolonged 1 million fold was returning to its normal flow, and thought link was released.</p><br/><p>The vicinity was shrouded with scent of the battlefield and we were glaring at each other with the same stance we had a little while ago.</p><br/><p>In real time, half hour had passed since the beginning of the fight.</p><br/><p>Even though I felt like the fight took place a long time ago, did my one on one fight with Hinata start only 30 minutes ago?</p><br/><p>Though I felt like time had already elapsed for several days, it looked like it never happened.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, shall we continue again?\u300d(Hinata)</p><br/><p>Like nothing happened, Hinata drew her sword.</p><br/><p>Eh, wait a minute.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey! The last time I had the advantage over you, I stopped! So, why did you nonchalantly ignore it!\u300d (Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know. Isn\u2019t it common sense to end a battle after delivering the final blow?\u300d (Hinata)</p><br/><p>\u300cKu......... This bastard.....\u300d (Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300cBesides, after my subordinates became like that, I cannot afford to withdraw silently, right?\u300d (Hinata)</p><br/><p>What was she saying?</p><br/><p>So I thought, and looked around at my surroundings.........</p><br/><p>\u300cImpossible, it is already impossible. Do as you like, you damn monster!\u300d (Anon Holy Knight)</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. It was more enjoyable than I thought. Let\u2019s us have a break for a while\u300d(Diablo)</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat, rest!? Whatever! Damn it!\u300d (Anon Holy Knight)</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. Oh dear, don\u2019t say so!\u300d(Diablo)</p><br/><p>Such was exchange between Diablo and the Holy Knights.</p><br/><p>\u300cGo away! You nuisance.\u300d(Souei)</p><br/><p>\u300cAa, Souei-sama.......how mean!\u300d(Tortured Female Holy Knight)</p><br/><p>For some reason, a redhead and beautiful onee-san leaned coquettishly against Souei.</p><br/><p>How should I put it, what were you doing in the fight? My anger was about to gush forth slightly, you know?</p><br/><p>\u300cI am terribly sorry, Rimuru-sama. I was torturing her, but it seems I made a mistake.</p><br/><p>Somehow it became like this...........\u300d (Souei)</p><br/><p>Souei apologized to me while he pushed aside the redhead Holy Knight while being annoyed.</p><br/><p>Although I was puzzled by what kind of torture he had conducted, I was more worried about what kind of torture that could cause such a reaction.</p><br/><p>I really don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on there.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, get away from Souei-sama!\u300d(Souka)</p><br/><p>Souka shouts vigorously with loud voice.</p><br/><p>But the voice doesn\u2019t match with her completely exhausted appearance. She looks likes she was unable to stand up.</p><br/><p>If you look around, Gobuta, Gabil and also Souei\u2019s Shadow squad were exhausted and looked like they wanted to collapse.</p><br/><p>Next to them was Hakurou sighing.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys, will be drilled and tempered by me\u300d(Hakurou)</p><br/><p>So he grumbled. As the words became the final blow, Gobuta and the others suddenly collapsed.</p><br/><p>Next to Gobuta and others, the Holy Knights were also similarly worn-out and laying around. It seems like an intense battle had unfolded there.</p><br/><p>But it seem their battle was not satisfying for Hakurou, didn\u2019t they do their best with Holy Knights as the opponent?</p><br/><p>\u300cI was deceived-ssu. My opponent was the strongest one, so cruel-ssu!\u300d(Gobuta)</p><br/><p>\u300cTo end up drawing a Hobgoblin as an opponent...... That? I am also not in a good position......\u300d (Gregory)</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be!......... I have tried my best! And yet why!?\u300d(Gabil)</p><br/><p>Unanimously, they were complaining about something. Oh well, I have nothing else to say except condolences.</p><br/><p>Well, this was still okay, even though I still don\u2019t understand what happened to Souei\u2019s opponent, I will just leave it behind.</p><br/><p>But I soon caught a glimpse of a grievous scene that made me want to avert my eyes, I think they were Holy Knight who had become playmates of Ranga and Shion</p><br/><p>Looking by a glance, lying in front of Ranga were eight people that were left with only tattered pants.</p><br/><p>Ranga seemed to have carried them with his mouth, while wagging his tail energetically.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy master! These people were the best to check my condition after my evolution\u300d(Ranga)</p><br/><p>Ranga said so happily.</p><br/><p>Although I told him not to do things excessively.........Well, at least he didn\u2019t kill them.</p><br/><p>\u300cO, ou. Good for you then.....\u300d (Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! Can I play more?\u300d (Ranga)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, please stop. Those people might be tired already....\u300d (Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? I understand.\u300d (Ranga)</p><br/><p>Was he not playing enough? His tail has hung down but.........</p><br/><p>Were they relieved by my words? I think I heard relieved voices from the people under Ranga\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>Yup, it was their voice, all right.</p><br/><p>If Ranga played another round with them, those people will die.</p><br/><p>Frankly, they were saved! Their faces, with their thankful eyes, were directed towards me.........</p><br/><p>Was it alright for the Holy Knight to do that? I became a bit worried, but it can\u2019t be helped, since their opponent was Ranga.</p><br/><p>The main problem was about Shion\u2019s opponent\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>Why? Why did everyone\u2019s limbs disappear and their body left to squirm on the ground?</p><br/><p>I believed that Shion\u2019s smug face was a bad premonition. It really was.</p><br/><p>\u300c.......Oi. Shion. What did you do to those people?\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! For the commendation, thank you very much!</p><br/><p>These things (people)[4], because they dared to try and oppose Rimuru-sama, I punished them a little.\u300d(Shion)</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not praising you! You idiot.</p><br/><p>Although Shion proudly answered, but.......</p><br/><p>No matter how you look at it, it was too overboard. In the beginning, except for my subordinates, I didn\u2019t really care about the people who opposed me or trash or something like that.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi...... Although I said do your best, no matter how you look at it you are overdoing it! Don\u2019t kill them! Didn\u2019t I say that?\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s alright. Everyone still lives energetically like this!\u300d(Shion)</p><br/><p>No no!</p><br/><p>Even if they are alive, they were not in a good condition. Didn\u2019t those who lost their arms and legs have a blank and hollow expression?!</p><br/><p>What's more, since they were protecting people, if they lack arms and legs, how could they fight against monsters?</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t understand what I want to say, this fellow.......</p><br/><p>\u300cShion, it seems like it\u2019s just you that did not obey my order.</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t have any explanation......\u300d (Rimuru)</p><br/><p>Just when I attempted to speak,</p><br/><p>\u300cOops! I forgot! You guys, be delighted and express your gratitude to Rimuru-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>While saying such words, in a great haste she collects all the squirming Holy Knights under her feet in one swoop.</p><br/><p>And then sprinkles over the Full Potion (Complete Recovery Medicine).</p><br/><p>In front of my sight, the Holy Knights\u2019 limbs were growing back.</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t understand her ability, she obtained a very terrifying ability, that Shion.</p><br/><p>Did she manipulate the system\u2019s effect? An absurd dangerous skill had awakened in this troublesome girl.</p><br/><p>I cannot stop myself from sympathizing with her opponent.</p><br/><p>The Holy Knight that had their arms and legs restored, were sharing their joy with each other.</p><br/><p>Their joy was great since they weren\u2019t turned into a disabled person, which is understandable because of how many daily training they had.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s because of Shion\u2019s rampage, from now on I decided to pay more attention to her.</p><br/><p>Well, as long as Holy Knights safety was confirmed, so I thought.</p><br/><p>However, oh well......</p><br/><p>About Hinata, is it because she saw her subordinates in a miserable condition?</p><br/><p>You reap what you sow, but this is just an excuse.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be helped. To set up the fence again, so let\u2019s become an enemy, huh?</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand. It can\u2019t be helped, I will be your opponent.</p><br/><p>However, no hard feelings in this! Can you swear if you lose fairly, you will not meddle with this country?\u300d (Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300c......... I understand. Let\u2019s promise, this match is the last!\u300d (Hinata)</p><br/><p>I believe in you, Hinata.</p><br/><p>Unlike the previous time, the hesitation inside Hinata\u2019s eyes was gone.</p><br/><p>It also didn\u2019t look like she was exacting the revenge for the poor treatment of holy knights, maybe it\u2019s because she had properly listened to my words.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s good. You can\u2019t stay stubborn all the time.</p><br/><p>Well then, this was the last match.</p><br/><p>While holding each one\u2019s sword, we closed our distance together.</p><br/><p>Everyone, including the holy knights, were watching us intently.</p><br/><p>What is Justice, tedious talk is also not good.</p><br/><p>In the end, although it was annoying to resort to violence, it was easy to understand.</p><br/><p>To bet their beliefs, the fight between two people had restarted.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>Frankly, there was no possibility for me to lose.</p><br/><p>After all, there was\u300eFuture Attack Prediction\u300f.</p><br/><p>Although Holy attribute can pierce through Covenant King Uriel\u2019s Absolute Defense, I already have eyes that can see all the sword lines.</p><br/><p>Having such thoughts, I must never think carelessly.</p><br/><p>In my vision, \u300eFuture Attack Prediction\u300f emitted light for the line of all predicted attacks</p><br/><p>Nn???</p><br/><p>Surprised. What was the meaning of this? To me, who was having such thoughts, </p><br/><p>\u300aNotification. The Individual: Sakaguchi Hinata\u2019s growth was confirmed. She most likely posses \u201cHero\u2019s Egg\u201d.</p><br/><p>Because of this reason, she has become an existence that surpasses logic, and because of this result, she seemed to gain a resistance against Result Prediction System\u2019s ability.\u300b</p><br/><p>In other word, I must avoid using my own power?</p><br/><p>Why did this happen! Didn\u2019t I have the upper hand during the previous positions?</p><br/><p>To grow in the middle of the fight, although it was wonderful, to happen at this time was too much!</p><br/><p>Damn, what the hell does this mean! Seriously,</p><br/><p>Even the Gluttonous King Beelzebub vanished in the fight before......</p><br/><p>While thinking such things, I desperately warded off Hinata\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>Even though she became \u201cHero\u2019s Egg\u201d, it seemed to not strengthen her suddenly.</p><br/><p>That was a relief. Because I can still deal with her somehow.</p><br/><p>However, I can\u2019t win just by evading. There must something that I can do if not....</p><br/><p>Towards me who was lost in thoughts,</p><br/><p>\u300aNotification. There is no problem. Gluttonous King Beelzebub\u2019s revival is possible.\u300b</p><br/><p>Huh? Wasn\u2019t it annihilated....... </p><br/><p>\u300aNotification. Although it was annihilated, it was possible to revive it, there was no problem.\u300b</p><br/><p>What the past tense for! Even so shouldn\u2019t you say that earlier! Shouldn\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>I was wavering between delight and annoyance, Wisdom King Raphael let out an even more explosive statement.</p><br/><p>\u300aNotification. Should Covenant King Uriel\u2019s Absolute Defense be activated? YES/NO \u300b</p><br/><p>Hey! Why didn\u2019t you activated it since a little while ago?</p><br/><p>To my question, Wisdom King Raphael answered about this matter, I almost reached the limit of my surprise.</p><br/><p>Anyway, </p><br/><p>\u300aSolution. Holy attribute can pass through Covenant King Uriel\u2019s Absolute Defense.</p><br/><p>Therefore, there was no point to activate it. \u300b</p><br/><p>Etc, so it announced.</p><br/><p>Even a perfectionist has a limit.</p><br/><p>During the fight with Hinata before, it said that the movement of Holy attribute\u2019s attack was impossible to predict.</p><br/><p>Based on Raphael\u2019s analysis, about why it was possible to penetrate the Absolute Defense was because its substance was only \u201cSpirit Substance\u201d and \u201cShadow Substance\u201d. It could pass because Absolute Defense\u2019s barrier which only protects against Magic Power.</p><br/><p>Raphael had reasoned that because it makes small scale moves at random, prediction of its contact point was impossible.</p><br/><p>So why was Raphael talking about this while filled with confidence?</p><br/><p>In other words, it means that Raphael had devised a perfect way to defend against Hinata\u2019s attack, right?</p><br/><p>\u300aSolution. Not long ago, the data of Melt Slash [5] that annihilated Gluttonous King Beelzebub was collected.</p><br/><p>The result, Holy Sword technique: Melt Slash was acquired.</p><br/><p>In this case, it was an event not covered in the prediction; it was now possible to percept the law of Spirit Substance\u2019s movement.\u300b[6]</p><br/><p>Hmm.......</p><br/><p>Nn? Wait a minute, waaiiiit a minute.</p><br/><p>Eh? So that means, even If I received a direct hit from Hinata\u2019s sword a while ago, there was a possibility that I wouldn\u2019t receive any damage?</p><br/><p>\u300a\u2026\u2026\u300b</p><br/><p>Oi! You ignoring me? This bastard.......</p><br/><p>So it means, not answering was the answer, huh?</p><br/><p>Eh? But.....</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, even if I received the direct hit from Hinata\u2019s Melt Slash before, I would not die?</p><br/><p>\u300aSolution. Of course. There was a possibility to receive large damage, but it was also possible to regenerate immediately.\u300b</p><br/><p>Then, why did it seem like you were panicking? Perhaps......... it was because you wanted me to eat and analyze Melt Slash, right?[7]</p><br/><p>\u300a\u2026\u2026\u300b</p><br/><p>Oh! You still don\u2019t want to answer again!</p><br/><p>This fellow, gradually the response becomes high class. If it is compared to Human, it was good at scheming.</p><br/><p>Even if it had an ego, I could honestly believe it.</p><br/><p>........But, certainly. It\u2019s because that was something I had wished for.</p><br/><p>Can I withstand that attack? Can I also use it?</p><br/><p>In that moment it understood my wishes and immediately executed it, huh? This ability (Raphael) was no joke (overpowered).</p><br/><p>This ability was way too good for someone like me.</p><br/><p>\u300aNo. I only exist for Master\u2019s sake\u300b [8]</p><br/><p>You immediately refuted it.</p><br/><p>Humph, thank you.</p><br/><p>Hereafter, I will be relying on you, Partner! But... I beg you to not do something secretly.</p><br/><p>Inside Thought Acceleration, the exchange between Wisdom King Raphael and I ended instantly.</p><br/><p>And, invoking Covenant King Uriel\u2019s Absolute Defense, my left hand caught Hinata\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>Astonished, Hinata opened her eyes wide.</p><br/><p>That was so. In my life, that was the fastest strike.</p><br/><p>Facing Hinata, </p><br/><p>\u300cComplete victory for me, Hinata!\u300d[9]</p><br/><p>So I announce it, I use Melt Slash.</p><br/><p>A shining flash.</p><br/><p>A strike flash that even eyes cannot follow, the sword in Hinata\u2019s hand was broken, and then the strike stops right before Hinata\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>The match was decided.</p><br/><p>Hinata was frozen because of the surprise but, </p><br/><p>\u300cIt was my complete defeat, Rimuru. You may do anything you like........\u300d</p><br/><p>So she muttered, and closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>The fight was over with my victory.</p><br/><p>Well then.</p><br/><p>Finally, it seems Hinata has become meek to me, did she finally agree to listen to my words? </p><br/><p>Thus, the Holy Knights\u2019 attack was completely fended off.</p><br/><p>Or precisely, I felt it was too one-sided. I think I would deliberately pretend to have never seen it.</p><br/><p>The cleaning up afterwards will be difficult, but the problem was solved for the time being.</p><br/><p>[1] Thought Restraint () will change after there more explanation about this ability</p><br/><p>[2]  (\u30c6\u30ad) = Reality (Enemy) double meaning</p><br/><p>[3] It means 10-19 years ago.</p><br/><p>[4] Shion use Kono monotachi....

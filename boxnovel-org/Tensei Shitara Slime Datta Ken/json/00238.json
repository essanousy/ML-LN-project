In the first place, she didn\u2019t need to worry about defense since she had\u300eCastle Guard\u300fafter all\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Lucia thought so.</p><br/><p>And she would make Chloe as her sword and incorporated her into\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300f.</p><br/><p>By doing so, Lucia would become a totally flawless being with offense and defense capabilities.</p><br/><p>Moreover,\u300eInfinity Prison\u300f wasn\u2019t actually an ability for defense.</p><br/><p>It is an ability to seal opponent that was too difficult to be destroyed like spiritual life-forms.</p><br/><p>(Hero Chloe seems to have used it as an irregular defensive means because she was inexperienced as a human and couldn\u2019t master the ability\u2026\u2026 but now it\u2019s an unnecessary ability. If it\u2019s me I could master it perfectly, but rather than doing something half-hearted such as sealing the enemy, I\u2019ll destroy the enemy completely. Yes\u2015\u2015Under the name of Justice, all of God\u2019s enemies shall be destroyed!)</p><br/><p>So, from that flow of thoughts, Lucia made the decision to erase\u300eInfinity Prison\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Thus, the forbidden door is opened\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Although Lucia knew about it due to her wisdom which could even unravel the secrets of skills\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>That ability,\u300eInfinity Prison\u300fis an ability for sealing something.</p><br/><p>Like \u201cPandora Box\u201d which contained all of the world\u2019s evils and calamities inside, an \u201cEvil\u201d was sealed deep inside Chloe\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Once released, that \u201cEvil\u201d would spread chaos and disaster into this world.</p><br/><p>Ramiris tried to interfere at the time Chloe who transcended time fused with the young Chloe was because she sensed this \u201cEvil\u201d.</p><br/><p>That \u201cEvil\u201d would have felt various negative feelings as they traveled through a long time repetitively. Chloe continued to seal it with her strong will.</p><br/><p>However, such feelings matured inside Chloe\u2019s heart and created a hideous personality.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf only you don't wake up a sleeping tiger[4], you will only have me as your opponent, but now.......\u300d</p><br/><p>That was Chloe\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>At the end of those words, Chloe\u2019s consciousness changed completely.</p><br/><p>If the Atonement Hero who carried all of humanity\u2019s negative feelings onto herself is Chloe, the Godslayer Hero who condemned everything and loathed humanity\u2019s sins is also Chloe.</p><br/><p>It is Chloe yet also not Chloe.</p><br/><p>It is the one who condemns everything without any mercy.</p><br/><p>Its name is \u201cManas\u201d Chronoa[5].</p><br/><p>Now that the seal was gone, it was freed from the prison of the heart.</p><br/><p>Although they were the same being, its strength was in a different dimension.</p><br/><p>Even Yuuki\u2019s curse that bound Chloe until then, was severed instantly.</p><br/><p>There was nothing that could stop Chloe now.</p><br/><p>For a totally flawless being that Lucia said of itself, that was exactly the word for Chloe.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015However, the current Chloe wouldn\u2019t lose to this \u201cEvil\u201d.</p><br/><p>Her strong will\u2015\u2015 and the fragments of Shizue and Hinata\u2019s heart are living inside Chloe\u2019s heart after all.</p><br/><p>Above all, there\u2019s Rimuru now.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Chloe understood that Chronoa was no more than a part of her heart too.</p><br/><p>She just accepted Chronoa straightforwardly and it completely fused with her.</p><br/><p>As Chloe had accepted the unleashed Chronoa,\u300eHope Lord Sariel\u300fwhich had completed its role, disappeared into Chloe\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>However, all of its abilities are still usable by Chloe\u2019s will in the same manner as before.</p><br/><p>\u300cJustice? What is Justice? Something uncertain and changing subjectively like that is your justification, you said? If that\u2019s so, you are not my enemy\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Lucia felt she heard Chloe\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>(Don\u2019t mock me! Justice is the only eternal truth of all things!)</p><br/><p>She tried to refute, but she never could.</p><br/><p>Because Lucia\u2019s consciousness had been locked in complete darkness instantly\u2026...</p><br/><p>That was what happened in Chloe\u2019s inner world.</p><br/><p>Chloe\u2019s deadly blade, \u300eAbsolute End\u300f\u2015\u2015which was released in order to interfere with Lucia\u2019s consciousness\u2015\u2015 did not even allow any resistance and annihilated her in one blow.</p><br/><p>Thus, the fight in this northern land ended.</p><br/><p> \u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Velzard shook off the binding and Chloe cut down the curse.</p><br/><p>Although there were some who were quite exhausted, ultimately everyone was all right.</p><br/><p>\u300cKuaaaahhahaha! How about we call it a draw for today?\u300d</p><br/><p>With cuts all over his body, Veldora had barely dodged Chloe\u2019s last strike, but he was relieved to know that it was over.</p><br/><p>And casually, he insisted on calling their fight as a draw.</p><br/><p>Chloe\u2019s last attack was impossible to be analyzed even for Veldora. In the worst case, he couldn\u2019t help but thought that the attack possessed the same properties as\u300eSpace-Time Continuous Attack\u300fobtained by his sister, Velgrind.</p><br/><p>He even felt a bit scared, but it would be his loss if he worried about that.</p><br/><p>He wanted to fight the Hero who got serious, but he wanted to win so he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to be defeated.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Veldora judged that he would be satisfied with a draw.</p><br/><p>\u300cReally? It seemed to me that you wanted to fight me, so I wouldn\u2019t mind being your opponent once this Great War was over\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmmm!? N-no, no, you don\u2019t need to be that considerate. Kuahahaha, I have seen most of your attacks from our exchanges too, there\u2019s no need for us to fight for the time being.\u300d</p><br/><p>While slightly panicking, Veldora turned down Chloe\u2019s offer.</p><br/><p>Veldora was somewhat scared of his two sisters\u2019 gazes towards him, but he pretended he didn\u2019t notice and ignored them.</p><br/><p>At least, he found out that he couldn\u2019t compete with Chloe in swordsmanship at all.</p><br/><p>As for things he said, there was no lie in Veldora\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Inside his mind, Veldora swore that he would train his swordsmanship thoroughly from the base up.</p><br/><p>Next was Guy who spoke to Chloe..</p><br/><p>Returning to his usual male form, Guy began talking to Chloe while Veldora returned his sword back.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, is that your true power?\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe nodded to Guy\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Or rather\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? It seems that the seraphim\u2019s energy is left behind. And\u2026...\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe had treated the power as her own too naturally, but in actuality she had stolen a majority of Lucia\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>That was not all, there was also fragments of\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300fleft behind from \u201cManas\u201c Lucia\u2019s remains.</p><br/><p>As a result\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300aNotification. Individual: Chloe Aubert, confirmed to have gathered the three elements of\u300eCourage\u300f\u300eHope\u300f\u300eJustice\u300f[6]. Moreover, the presence of Ultimate Skill\u300eSpace-Time Lord Yog-Sothoth\u300fin her possession had been confirmed. \"Alteration\u201d is automatically activated\u2026\u2026 Successful. Ultimate Skill\u300eSpace-Time Lord Yog-Sothoth\u300fhas evolved into\u300eSpace-Time God Yog-Sothoth[7]\u300f.\u300b</p><br/><p>Within Chloe, an ultimate evolution was being carried without her realization.</p><br/><p>Even if it was an enormous energy of a seraph, it wasn\u2019t sufficient at all to activate that ability (Alteration)\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Because of that, Chloe\u2019s evolution ended without being noticed by anyone.</p><br/><p>Not even Guy could notice that evolution; it was due to Complete Concealment of Ultimate Skill\u300eSpace-Time God Yog-Sothoth\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cLooks like it. So, what happened to that Lucia fellow?\u300d</p><br/><p>Due to what was stated before, Guy asked about Lucia\u2019s end without paying attention to the seraph\u2019s remains.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have eliminated a part of her that possessed me. But, her main body is safe.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you let her go?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo\u2015\u2015\u300dso Chloe muttered to Guy who asked with sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>A small smile appeared on her lips.</p><br/><p>It seemed like there was a glimpse of cruelty unsuited of a Hero in her expression\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Probably, it might not just be a hallucination.</p><br/><p>It was proof that the remnants of Chronoa which had fused with Chloe were still alive.</p><br/><p>It was something unthinkable for the naturally gentle Chloe, but if it was Chronoa, it could do it without hesitation.</p><br/><p>However, that was still something unbecoming for Chloe\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Therefore, Chloe decided to leave the judgment to Lucia\u2019s own actions.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt will be great if Lucia admits her defeat obediently, but if she doesn\u2019t do so\u2015\u2015 I shall teach her the true meaning of despair.\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe declared so and stared at Guy with her strong-willed eyes.</p><br/><p>After all, her victory was certain.</p><br/><p>Moreover, for some reason\u2015\u2015Chloe felt that she wouldn\u2019t be the one who decided Lucia\u2019s fate.</p><br/><p>\u300cVery well. Then, shall we quickly go to defeat Velda?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, let\u2019s quickly defeat the mastermind, I want to return to Sensei\u2019s place.\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy and Chloe were in consensus.</p><br/><p>Veldora was about to say \u201cBecause the cuts all over my body aches, I\u2019ll return once they recover\u201d\u2015\u2015 but he remained silent before his two sisters\u2019 gazes.</p><br/><p>It was a very wise decision.</p><br/><p>Thus, the five people who could be said as the tops of this world began to move towards the Heaven.</p><br/><p> \u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u300cIMPOSSIBLE, IMPOSSIBLE, IMPOSSIBLE!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Lucia was screaming in her main body while going partly mad.</p><br/><p>Something impossible had happened just now.</p><br/><p>A \u201cManas\u201d with the strongest Will, was destroyed just by a mere human.</p><br/><p>She absolutely couldn\u2019t accept such a thing.</p><br/><p>Lucia thought so and derived the most optimum solution with her thoughts still in chaos.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015That\u2019s right, I just have to erase everything in the northern land\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Only after she thought so, calm returned to her heart.</p><br/><p>And then she turned around and smiled at the being over there.</p><br/><p>With compassionate expressions that matched her gentle appearance,</p><br/><p>\u300cMilim, I want you to listen to your mother\u2019s request \u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>She said so.</p><br/><p>A terrifying plan made by Lucia.</p><br/><p>Her plan was to annihilate Guy and Chloe along with the northern continent using Milim\u2019s Drago Nova[8] from a very high altitude.</p><br/><p>She would order Velzard, who was under her control, with\u300eThought Transmission\u300fto stop the movement of the other three people.</p><br/><p>She had planned to strike them all in one go.</p><br/><p>If she matched the timing and made Velzard self-destruct, it would cause massive destruction with the super high dense energy from the body of \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d as the source of the explosion.</p><br/><p>With the synergy of Drago Nova, it would annihilate the northern continent.</p><br/><p>It might even affect the planet itself, but such a thing was a trivial matter to Lucia.</p><br/><p>Guy, Chloe, Velgrind, and Veldora.</p><br/><p>She only had to get rid of those four people and everything would be fine.</p><br/><p>If faced with this great destruction, it would be impossible even for those four people to survive.</p><br/><p>Lucia estimated the result would be so.</p><br/><p>\u300cMilim, you see\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>At the moment when Lucia tried to continue with her words...</p><br/><p>\u300cGood grief, are you a fool who can\u2019t even accept your own defeat?\u300d</p><br/><p>Such cold words came out from Milim\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Lucia stared at Milim with eyes full of shock.</p><br/><p>\u300cI shall have you stop doing foolish things with my mother\u2019s appearance for good.\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim declared and smiled fearlessly towards Lucia.</p><br/><p>It was like a lie that she was obedient like a doll until now.</p><br/><p>\u300cWha, you!? Could it be you aren\u2019t under control\u2015\u2015!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHumph, you finally realized? I decided to stay obedient until now because I can\u2019t come up with a way to break through your defense, but I don\u2019t need to do so anymore, you see? I want to reclaim my mother\u2019s body quickly, so let\u2019s get started!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim declared so and smiled complacently.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat a foolish thing to say!? I have\u300eCastle Guard\u300f. There are many angels in this heaven, and besides even humanity\u2019s faiths are directed to this ability now, my defensive powers are incomparable to Rudra\u2019s which was reliant on something as vulnerable as loyalty \u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSHUT UP!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim interrupted Lucia with a roar.</p><br/><p>And then, she thrust her fist towards Lucia.</p><br/><p>Lucia instantly put her guard up.</p><br/><p>\u300eCastle Guard\u300f automatically deployed in front of Lucia and protected her.</p><br/><p>(You\u2019re foolish, Milim. It\u2019s troublesome that you broke out the control unexpectedly, but if Velda-sama awakened with perfect form, someone like you won\u2019t matter. I only have to endure until then\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>The real surprise hit Lucia at the moment she thought up that far.</p><br/><p>\u300eCastle Guard\u300f was smashed into pieces and scattered before her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cIm-impossible!?\u300d</p><br/><p>An unbelievable and unacceptable reality was expanding in front of Lucia.</p><br/><p>\u300cFool? You\u2019re the fool here, you know? You don\u2019t understand the ability at all. You are like a child who knows secrets and wants to tamper on things with them. Do you know why my father, Veldanava, didn\u2019t give offensive capability to\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300f\u2026\u2026? It seems you thought that it was incomplete, but that\u2019s wrong. That skill was complete because it was incomplete. What do you think will happen if the \u201cSpear that could pierce everything\u201d and \u201cShield that could block everything\u201d come together[9]? Also, justice itself is something filled with contradictions. When you support one side, Justice will lose its impartialness. An absolute justice is nothing but fantasy. Because of this ambiguity, my father kept\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300f incomplete. It just became a power to protect without offensive power. Justice without force is powerless, but if you have the power to protect it, you could fulfill everything. That alone is what made it complete.\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim indifferently informed Lucia. Like a teacher enlightening a foolish student.</p><br/><p>And now, her hand was slowly extended towards Lucia.</p><br/><p>\u300cImpossible, I won\u2019t accept it. I will never accept such a thing!! Justice is the only\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s hand touched Lucia.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour absolute defense is gone. Soon, your abilities will disappear too. Before that happens, I shall perform your last rites with my own hand.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStop it! I\u2019m Lucia, Velda-sama\u2019s absolute believer, the one and only\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBegone from my mother. Mind Death Break[10]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Without mercy, Milim\u2019s destructive capability was fully displayed.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the \u201cManas\u201d created form\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300f named Lucia had been completely annihilated.</p><br/><p>Milim embraced her mother\u2019s corpse with a lonely expression.</p><br/><p>There was no warmth in the body, as it was freed from the effect of the ability, its time which had stopped begun to flow instantly.</p><br/><p>Lucia\u2019s body withered, turned into dust and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood night, Okaa-sama. Please, rest in peace\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim didn\u2019t have memories of her mother\u2019s warmth.</p><br/><p>For Milim, playing with her mother\u2019s sacred remains was a sin worthy of a certain death.</p><br/><p>She had achieved her goal of freeing her mother from Lucia who was being protected by the ultimate defense.</p><br/><p>Milim shall teach the next sinful person the depths of her wrath.</p><br/><p>The time has come.</p><br/><p>The name of the person she should judge was Velda\u2015\u2015the person who impersonated her father and played with her mother\u2019s corpse.</p><br/><p>From now on, Milim unleashed her suppressed wrath.</p><br/><p>The heaven was about to be filled with waves of Milim\u2019s wrath.</p><br/><p>--------</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>I avoided Chloe\u2019s Last Boss Route.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry for those who had been expecting that.</p><br/><p>I also have such versions, but I let it pass for now.</p><br/><p>[1] Uchigatana is a shorter version of Tachi.

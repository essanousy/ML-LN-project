Finally, it is finished. Now we can journey to other worlds ahead of Rimuru.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhoho. Encounters with the unknown! Rimuru is always so cautious about everything, so this is our chance, master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! I was thinking that too, Ramiris. At the forum that is to take place in Ingracia, a thesis on the Different Gate is to be revealed. However, we shall be the first to succeed before that even happens!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes! Rimuru is guaranteed to start saying, \u2018I\u2019ll go and play in that other world,\u2019 so we have to go first and see what it\u2019s like!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d</p><br/><p>As their conversation suggested, they had completed the procedure of opening a Different Gate.</p><br/><p>Of course, they did.</p><br/><p>This was because they had been helping with Mai Furuki\u2019s research, and were in a position to know what its contents.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t that they wanted to steal the results of the research and take credit for it.</p><br/><p>Their reasoning was simple. They were just looking for an opportunity to ignore Rimuru\u2019s warning that it was dangerous, and go on a journey to a different world.</p><br/><p>And if circumstances permit it, they would learn all they can and then surprise Rimuru with it later on.</p><br/><p>And so neither of them hesitated.</p><br/><p>Now that Rimuru was gone, they would hurry up and activate this new method and take off for a different world\u2014the two of them could think of nothing else.</p><br/><p>Rimuru\u2019s warnings were like a distant wind, and they cared not at all about whether or not this other world would be safe.</p><br/><p>They had no plans at all.</p><br/><p>However, they were both full of confidence and did not care about the small details. As always, they would cry only when the trouble arose.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe. Now that we\u2019ve decided, we should go at once!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Let\u2019s go!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris held onto Veldora\u2019s shoulder, and once Veldora was sure she was secure, he began to send magic energy into the circle.</p><br/><p>Beretta realized this and frantically ran towards them\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cWait just a min\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it was much too late!</p><br/><p>Light flowed from the magic circle and filled the room in a flash, engulfing even Beretta.</p><br/><p>And when the light disappeared, all three of them had vanished without a trace.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shinji had become worried that they hadn\u2019t come out for so long, and went to check on the room.</p><br/><p>There was a cup of coffee on the desk that was half empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Lord Ramiris is gone, and Mister Veldora\u2026 Where\u2026no, they couldn\u2019t have!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked down at the magic circle on the ground with startled amazement.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, damn it. So they must have been waiting for a time when Lord Rimuru is absent\u2026 Really, those two are so selfish. Ahhhh. It will not be my fault if they get scolded later. Damn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He muttered in defeat. Then he worried over how he could prove that he was not involved in this.</p><br/><p>But now that he thought about it, he had only helped in the research as Ramiris\u2019s assistant. And he was not an actual accomplice.</p><br/><p>And he had evidence, including the schedule in the research journal, so there really was no need to worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine then. And it will be good for them to be harshly reprimanded once in a while, or they will never learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shinji thought as if it had nothing to do with him.</p><br/><p>However\u2014</p><br/><p>Shinji would find himself in danger as well, in one weeks time.</p><br/><p>This was because Irina, who he had not heard from for a long time, would be arriving as a new research member.</p><br/><p>But Shinji could not predict the future, and so he hadn\u2019t the foggiest idea.</p><br/><p>His master was not here, and so he started to think that he could take a few days off.</p><br/><p>\u2013As for the encounter with Irina that awaited him, it was a story that only God would know.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>To put it simply, the Different Gate had been opened.</p><br/><p>And as the three of them had gone through it, they came out into the land of a different world.</p><br/><p>Well, maybe they didn\u2019t quite land, to be precise.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.\u201cGAAAAHHH!! Have we been thrown out into the sky!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, master!! We\u2019re falling. We\u2019re falling!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKaaaa\u2013hahaha! Well, I cannot fly well. But we won\u2019t die even if we fall. Now, hold on tight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Whaaat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them had been thrown from a point that was three-hundred meters above ground.</p><br/><p>Veldora, Ramiris and Beretta.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as high as it could have been, and they hit the ground in less than ten seconds.</p><br/><p>The ground approached them even as they talked, and they made contact with a thunderous crash.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what a shock! Master, what do you mean you can\u2019t fly?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Well, energy seems to be very thin in this world. I couldn\u2019t move like I wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Now that you mention it, the power of spirits is weaker here as well! Hey, what does this mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris said in shock after hearing Veldora\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>However, Veldora seemed confident.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

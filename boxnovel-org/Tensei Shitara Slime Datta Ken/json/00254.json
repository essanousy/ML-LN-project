I have something to request of Souei-dono. I want you to convey the message.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSouei-sama is currently busy. Please come again later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Souka went and rejected his request straight out.</p><br/><p>However, Diablo wouldn\u2019t give up just like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, now, don\u2019t say that. Or what is it, you plan on getting rid of me by force?\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo enforced overwhelming intimidation while still having a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Souka tried to endure it even while biting into her lips and making a grim face but-</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it, Diablo. If you want to come in, just come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a reposing voice came from inside, the tense air was also lifted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then I shall intrude.\u201d</p><br/><p>And like that, as if that was the natural procedure of things, Diablo casually went in and sat down on a sofa with an air of composure.</p><br/><p>As Diablo relaxed, a demon chevalier appeared out of nowhere and began serving on the table.</p><br/><p>Seeing all these with a side glance, Souei coldly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo did not answer immediately-he first took a sip of the black tea the demon chevalier prepared.</p><br/><p>And then, he surveyed the room.</p><br/><p>(Hmm. Now then, judging from his subordinate\u2019s (Souka\u2019s) actions, it seemed like he was having some sort of a conversation with Rimuru-sama just now but-)</p><br/><p>Souei is tight-lipped.</p><br/><p>There was no way Diablo would get an answer if he asked normally. However, he tried going head on this time on purpose.</p><br/><p>Diablo decided on that after thinking a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cKufufufu. It\u2019s simple. Where is Rimuru-sama at the moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Shuna and Shion are with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSurely you jest. If it\u2019s you-you probably know where the real Rimuru-sama is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Diablo went silent after saying that, Souei also looked at Diablo head on and went silent.</p><br/><p>And at that moment, both of their calculations mixed.</p><br/><p>As for Diablo, he planned on following around Souei wherever he went.</p><br/><p>As long as Souei doesn\u2019t confess, he just had to follow Souei around.</p><br/><p>And Souei had accurately read Diablo\u2019s thoughts and instantly came to the conclusion that that would prove to be an obstacle to what he was going to do now. However, it would be difficult to say the least to get rid of Diablo and he isn\u2019t someone Souei can deceive easily either.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to say this out loud but, you do understand that I won\u2019t leave you until you answer me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThought so. You won\u2019t believe me if I said I didn\u2019t know, would you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t. There\u2019s no way you, who is connected to Rimuru-sama physically to always be able to have contact, doesn\u2019t know of his location, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo answered with a smile.</p><br/><p>And in fact, Souei indeed was the only one who had a physical connection to Rimuru among other connection methods so that he can make contact if by chance things were to go wrong.</p><br/><p>And that physical connection method was a connection formed with \u2018Sticky Steel String\u2019 and \u2018Shadow s.p.a.ce\u2019.</p><br/><p>It is an application of the string telephone method but with this, it is possible to convey thoughts even faster than normal conversation with the help of complicated encrypted transmission.</p><br/><p>As there are some beings who can trace communication between the subordinates who use \u2018Thought Transmission\u2019, they came up with this a.n.a.log method.</p><br/><p>It is something Rimuru came up with in case of the worst case scenario but Souei was supposed to be the only one who knew about it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Souei was menacing.</p><br/><p>In response to that, Diablo was still composed but, unusually enough, he laid bare his emotions. And in his beautiful face, he deepened the devil-like smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cKufufufu. So it really exists? I had thought Rimuru-sama would come up with something like that. I didn\u2019t feel the need for it till now so I didn\u2019t bother but the situation calls for it now so I had to confirm it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018He got me\u2019-was what Souei thought.</p><br/><p>To fall for a leading question-an unlikely miss for Souei.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t just a miss on Souei\u2019s part, it was also the result of Diablo\u2019s skillful \u2018Thought Guidance\u2019.</p><br/><p>Souei wouldn\u2019t have fallen for it under normal circ.u.mstances but the situation was different this time.</p><br/><p>Souei was in no situation to have a prolonged conversation with Diablo-he needed to act immediately.</p><br/><p>As such, he fell for it due to a slight impatience.</p><br/><p>Souei clicked his tongue and sunk in his chair.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will have to cooperate as well then, is that fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Souei asked Diablo with a sour expression, to which Diablo replied with a satisfied nod.</p><br/><p>And like this, Diablo and Souei began to cooperate and move accordingly.</p><br/><p>Giving up on trying to evade Diablo, Souei decided to insert him into the plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Diablo accepted, Souei called out to the next room as they didn\u2019t have much time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahhahha, Souei-han still has ways to go, huh? Being completely trapped by Diablo-han like that.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Alliance of Three Kingdoms</p><br/><p>Hinata and Ruminas were in chairs awaiting our arrival.</p><br/><p>From the looks on their faces, something must have happened.</p><br/><p>Well, I guess it\u2019s a good thing they don\u2019t know I\u2019ve been just playing around the whole time. It certainly wouldn\u2019t go over well if they knew.</p><br/><p>\u300cFuze-kun, come on in\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, having Fuze join us in the reception room we prepared.</p><br/><p>Without me needing to say anything, Shuna had already prepared tea.</p><br/><p>She really is a well-disciplined Ohime-sama. Completely different from a certain regrettable secretary, but that secretary does get serious when training the subordinates and the guards.</p><br/><p>But considering that I\u2019ve been slacking off lately, I have no right to complain.</p><br/><p>No, actually, I haven\u2019t been playing around! I was studying!</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t be getting this distinction wrong myself; or else someone will find out.</p><br/><p>Alongside Fuse, I sat on the sofa whilst facing Ruminas and Hinata.</p><br/><p>A cushion made with material of the highest quality gently caught my body.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey Hinata, it\u2019s been a long time. Ruminas-san, nice to meet you\u2026 no, we have met before. It\u2019s been a while.</p><br/><p>This is Fuse-kun. He\u2019s the Freedom Association Branch head in Burmund.\u300d</p><br/><p>I introduced Fuse to the two ladies.</p><br/><p>\u300cN-nice to meet you! I, within the Burmund Kingdom, work as the head of its Freedom Association branch.</p><br/><p>To be able to meet Hinata-sama today, the highest tactician of the Western Church, I am truly honored.</p><br/><p>And to this beautiful lady, it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever met, but you must be someone of illustrious prestige.</p><br/><p>I am uneducated in these matters so please forgive my ignorance!\u300d</p><br/><p>Greatly nervous he greeted them.</p><br/><p>Completely ignoring him, however,</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru, was it? \u2018Tis been a while, since Walpurgis that is. Glad to see you healthy. But, that man must not remain here. Freedom Association is the enemy. Or have you not noticed?</p><br/><p>The identity of he who manipulated Hinata.</p><br/><p>Knowing this fully well, why do you still associate yourself with someone from the Freedom Association?\u300d</p><br/><p>(Translator\u2019s/Editor\u2019s note: the word Ruminas uses to address Rimuru is  kisama which in modern time is an insult, commonly translated as \u201cbastard.\u201d Centuries ago, however, it was used to address a person politely, and this translation Clown feels fits better with Ruminas\u2019 mannerism)</p><br/><p>One of the primary Demon Lords\u2013Ruminas asked with an accusatory tone.</p><br/><p>She is a cute young girl silver hair, and heterochromatic eyes giving off a gold and silver shine.</p><br/><p>Why is one of the Octogram here?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s also strange that she\u2019s by Hinata\u2019s side; the worst thing I could do here though is act hostile and make her an enemy.</p><br/><p>Besides, forging an alliance with the Western Saint\u2019s Church will probably allow Tempest to fully integrate into human society.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s something I earnestly want to achieve. Hinata and Ruminas\u2019s relation is yet uncertain, but perhaps its best to speak openly rather than keep secrets.</p><br/><p>But considering that Ruminas probably knows everything Hinata knows, perhaps it\u2019s better to keep certain things hidden.</p><br/><p>But first, let\u2019s get them to trust Fuse.</p><br/><p>Right when I needed it, Shuna entered the room with the tea prepared.</p><br/><p>Shuna handed out the tea, and left the room after taking a bow.</p><br/><p>I glanced to the side and confirmed,</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. Now then, doubling as an introduction to Fuse-kun earlier, I would like you to have a look at the report\u300d</p><br/><p>After saying so, I beckoned Fuse.</p><br/><p>With that alone, the endlessly anxious Fuse seems to have caught on.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood. Apparently, it would seem that I am under suspicion. So as to clear myself from that suspicion\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying such, he begin explaining the current internal situations of the Freedom Association.</p><br/><p>Fuse\u2019s report was simple and concise.</p><br/><p>Yuuki has taken over 90% of the Ingrasia Headquarters.</p><br/><p>The female Submaster Kagari is also under his direct command.</p><br/><p>In addition, High ranking adventurers with abilities on par with Branch heads has also sided with Yuuki.</p><br/><p>And thus, with the Organisation currently so, it would prove difficult to denounce Yuuki. However, it would appear that those outside the headquarters are not affected.</p><br/><p>Since it seems that his brainwashing and thought manipulation isn\u2019t omnipotent\u2014something we can be happy about.</p><br/><p>Better yet, the citizens do not appear to be under his influence.</p><br/><p>The only thing they have been convinced of is that monsters are the cause of most calamities and are the enemy.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s to this degree, and considering my current progress, building a relation of mutual trust not impossible.</p><br/><p>I mean, think of the satellite city built around the labyrinth\u2014there orcs, goblins, monsters, and adventurers are able to sit in a pub and share a meal.</p><br/><p>We\u2019re certainly making progress towards building trust between us; I have proven that it is possible for humans and monsters to understand each other.</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, any further investigation is impossible. The person who went to investigate the Submaster Kagari alone, had his memories erased.</p><br/><p>He was crippled and wandered the town as if protecting it. He even forgot his own name.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no proof that Kagari did it, but considering the situation it\u2019s pretty obvious.</p><br/><p>Besides, she probably knows that we\u2019ve been investigating her; I have no excuses, I have failed there\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems anything outside of this is out of his hands.</p><br/><p>However this is enough.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, then that would make saving the children a problem.</p><br/><p>If I make a move, there would be the problem of it being pinned as a kidnapping by the demon lord. However if I ask Masayuki then there\u2019s probably no problem. Fortunately, there\u2019s a convenient reason to every one of his actions, making him suitable.</p><br/><p>Since it\u2019s absolutely impossible for Yuuki to control him, there\u2019s no need to be reserved.</p><br/><p>After rescuing the children, I\u2019ll immediately dissipate the effects of any mind control. But I can\u2019t have them think that I\u2019ve been playing around here the whole time, so I should make it look like I\u2019ve done a lot.</p><br/><p>However, about the erased memories. It\u2019s troublesome\u2026 but if it\u2019s me, then I might be able to restore it.</p><br/><p>\u300cFuse, I\u2019ll try to heal those who had their memories wiped.</p><br/><p>If their soul and their brain is intact, I might be able to somehow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? Is that true? Please, do it somehow!\u300d</p><br/><p>In response to my offer, Fuse looked at me with expectant eyes.</p><br/><p>They have been acting by my order so they are essentially my subordinates. If there\u2019s a way to cure them I have an obligation to do it.</p><br/><p>He had a happy look on his face and readily accepted the proposition.</p><br/><p>But to think he trusts me so much to accept a deal with a demon lord! Makes me kind of happy.\u3001</p><br/><p>And so, overlooking our exchange,</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru, do you really think that you can coexist with humans?</p><br/><p>Human are creatures whose thoughts cannot be read simply though their words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tis it not better for them to be controlled by us?\u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas gives me a cold look.</p><br/><p>That girl seems to have thought over this, however her opinions conflict with my own.</p><br/><p>Considering all the risks, it\u2019s certainly an option, but\u2015\u2015.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u201cOi oi, young lady. In spite of your beautiful face, you say some terrible things</p><br/><p>Control humans, who do you you are?</p><br/><p>Even if you are a noble, isn\u2019t it bad to look down on ordinary people?\u300d</p><br/><p>Fuse got angry and snapped at Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Oh right, I still haven\u2019t introduced her to Fuse. Well, I guess his ignorance led him to step on a landmine.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow now, Fuse Kun, Calm down.</p><br/><p>This person is Ruminas.</p><br/><p>One of the Octogram Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>This is my second time meeting her, and the first time we\u2019ve spoken to each other.</p><br/><p>First thing first, lets leave behind all truculent behavior and have a constructive talk.</p><br/><p>And, this is Hinata.</p><br/><p>But you should know more about her than I. She\u2019s the Knight Leader of the Western church.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve briefly introduced the two.</p><br/><p>Ruminas and Hinata, after listening to Fuse\u2019s report as per my request, had judged that he was no friend of Yuuki\u2019s.</p><br/><p>However, putting Hinata aside, Ruminas didn\u2019t seem trust in humans in general rather than Fuse himself.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, what? Demon Lord? Who?\u300d</p><br/><p>Looking back and forth between Ruminas and I, Fuse was in a state of confusion.</p><br/><p>Remembering his earlier belligerent remarks, his face instantly paled.</p><br/><p>I feel slightly sorry for him, and responded.</p><br/><p>\u300cRuminas, this man is my companion.</p><br/><p>Firstly I want to establish some trust.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t agree with your opinion on humans, and please don\u2019t force it onto me.</p><br/><p>If you do, you will be judged an enemy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat was that? Are you trying to lecture us despite being a newcomer?</p><br/><p>If you seek a war then shall get it.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas stood up, and took up a stance with both hands.</p><br/><p>I had planned to diffuse the situation but now I feel like taking this outside.</p><br/><p>How should I put this, contrary to her appearance, she\u2019s rather short-fused. Times like this constantly remind me that all demon lords are selfish and whimsical.</p><br/><p>But I\u2019d rather not fight in this room, though\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cStop this Ruminas, didn\u2019t we came here for an alliance?</p><br/><p>Why are you adding to our enemies?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata coaxed Ruminas with a hint of irritation.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph\u300d</p><br/><p>As if she was never serious to begin with, Ruminas\u2019s anger dissipated.</p><br/><p>And she sat back in her chair,</p><br/><p>\u300cTrue, we do not wish to increase our enemies.</p><br/><p>Our aim for coming today, is to propose an alliance between Tempest, Holy Empire of Ruberius, and Western Saint\u2019s Church.\u300d</p><br/><p>She declared with a thin smile on her lips.</p><br/><p>Clearly she was trying to gauge my reaction.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s hard to imagine that she was a demon lord with a bad personality from her appearance.</p><br/><p>Putting that aside, we have introduced ourselves once more, and began examining the details of the alliance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>That means, Ruminas was the ruler of the Holy Empire Ruberius?</p><br/><p>The conversation continued after we calmed down, but was a revelation!</p><br/><p>It seems this was too much of a surprise for Fuse, and he looked as if his soul had flown out of his mouth.</p><br/><p>(TN Note:\u2026I hope most of you seen enough anime to know what that means. If you haven\u2019t I recommend those from the slice of life genre.)</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s to be expected.</p><br/><p>The Holy Empire Ruberius where the sacred ones reside, where the Pope of the Western Church lives.</p><br/><p>Who would have imagined that it was all under control of a demon lord!</p><br/><p>In that case, who is the pope?</p><br/><p>\u300cOld man, they seem to be wondering about the pope\u300d</p><br/><p>In response to Ruminas\u2019s words, the butler behind her bowed respectively.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf I\u2019m not mistake, the current pope is currently 47 years old.\u300d</p><br/><p>I thought he muttered, and the butler transformed into a youthful figure.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is the first time we\u2019ve met. I am the current pope, Gilles Lila Ruberius.\u300d</p><br/><p>In this youthful (\u2026 nah, he\u2019s still middle aged) appearance, he turned into a butler clad in pure white, radiating a divine aura.</p><br/><p>His figure has become a man in his prime. In terms of human years, he would be around mid 40s.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 this butler has pretended to be the pope of every past generation?</p><br/><p>Looking at fuse with a glance, he was stunned with his eyes wide opened.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s a skillful one, I\u2019m actually impressed.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, isn\u2019t this weird! Why\u2019s the pope a follower of the demon lord! What the hell is this?! Are you a monster? Why do I feel a divine presence?\u300d</p><br/><p>Uh oh, instead of fainting, Fuse acted as if a switch has been pressed as he started causing a ruckus.</p><br/><p>\u300cFu. Gilles, explain.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas instructed,</p><br/><p>\u300cAs you command, milady\u300d</p><br/><p>The pope, no, Gilles the butler nodded respectively.</p><br/><p>Since it feels really weird I\u2019d much rather he stop these extravagant butler behavior, but I\u2019ll keep my discomfort a secret.</p><br/><p>It began thousands of years ago, before the creation of the Holy Empire of Ruberius.</p><br/><p>When the evil dragon Veldora destroyed the Vampire Kingdom, without killing anyone, though.</p><br/><p>It was then, that Ruminas and Chloe met, so it seems they\u2019ve been through a lot.</p><br/><p>Even though she protected Chloe, even if she hadn\u2019t, she probably would not have been injured anyways.</p><br/><p>To Ruminas, Chloe was probably the embodiment of idealized beauty.</p><br/><p>Oh, and though Veldora probably thought it was a friendly squabble, in reality it was just a one-sided rampage.</p><br/><p>However, being done in would be unpleasant, so the survivors hid and lived on in silence.</p><br/><p>However, there\u2019s the Demon Lord Ruminas.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t interested in simply hiding, and built an underground empire.</p><br/><p>And on the top she created an empire to sustain her underground empire.</p><br/><p>At the time, due to poverty caused by the conflict between angels and demons, there were few mighty nations. And the eastern empire had barely taken form.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t even send forces to protect the people from the threat of monsters.</p><br/><p>Naturally, almost everyone was a refugee or a bandit, and the world was even more confused and in turmoil.</p><br/><p>Precisely because it was such a time that she, with the power of a demon lord, was able to control monsters and easily control humans.</p><br/><p>Those who sought salvation came to her.</p><br/><p>Ruminas granted mercy to those who gathered under her. Using blood (Life) as bait, she granted them protection.</p><br/><p>And so, all within Ruminas\u2019s calculations, a country was formed this way.</p><br/><p>And thus it appeared, the Holy Kingdom Ruberius.</p><br/><p>Thus, allowing humans to live freely would lead to endless war\u2014the reason behind Ruminas\u2019 opinions was history itself.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think I can refute her. But that doesn\u2019t mean I agree with her.</p><br/><p>If they want to fight, let them fight; if they want to rampage let them.</p><br/><p>Then they could reconcile and seek to create peace.</p><br/><p>But this kind of outcome could not come about through a controlled experiment. And precisely because this was voluntarily, it was interesting</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>Now that country was born it would inevitably be controlled by some ambitious or greedy man\u2014the cause of Ruminas\u2019 next worry.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the Greater devil Gilles acted as her right hand.</p><br/><p>Butler Gilles is not only a vampire, but also a first-class holy sorcerer thus making him someone who can walk under the sun.</p><br/><p>It seems that including Ruminas and Gilles, there were few others who could walk under the sun despite being a vampire.</p><br/><p>At the time, since Gilles was such an individual, it was inevitable for him to become the priest.</p><br/><p>So he used clones and played many roles all by himself all to manipulate the empire\u2026 it must have been difficult.</p><br/><p>Well, and thus, Gilles who acted as the pope that was also said to be the incarnation of light, had obtained a unique ability</p><br/><p>It is the unique skill \u201cHierophant\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 An ability that allows a patron to dominate the will of those who seeks salvation and protection \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>In an sense, this was a ridiculous ability that is nothing but high level fraud.</p><br/><p>And so the people were able to live peacefully without any suspicion thanks to his ability.</p><br/><p>To be frank, for a dark-dwelling monster to gain a light based ability is ridiculous in itself.</p><br/><p>Whilst listening to all this from the side, it was interesting how Hinata made a bitter face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe creed is everything!\u201d I guess it sounds cool, but then you learn the dark history behind it.</p><br/><p>When I looked at Hinata while grinning, our eyes met.</p><br/><p>I was looked at with a cold stare that made me think I was going to be killed. Scary\u2026 I guess I shouldn\u2019t tease her about it.</p><br/><p>I guess I\u2019ll just pretend I know nothing about it at all.</p><br/><p>And so, ended Butler Gilles\u2019s description with such feelings.</p><br/><p>And Hinata\u2019s turn followed, explaining why she sought an alliance.</p><br/><p>About her bold plan to save the children, and her fight with Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Her death, and the awakening of the hero.</p><br/><p>And Hinata\u2019s resurrection by Ruminas, and the meeting between the hero Chloe and Ruminas.</p><br/><p>As well as the need for the alliance due to the hero\u2019s current situation as well as a countermeasure against Yuuki.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>It seems Hinata had went to rescue the children in my stead.</p><br/><p>It is a welcoming story.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, what happened to the children?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey are wandering around Tempest sight-seeing. Kenya, though desperately wants to catch up to Chloe\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>They are all rather upset that Chloe left without saying anything.\u300d</p><br/><p>I am satisfied with Hinata\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>However, I can sympathize with Chloe.</p><br/><p>It must have been painful, not only being forgotten, but being the only one who\u2019s an adult.</p><br/><p>As a hero, when the experience of the past awakened in her body, she would become an unrecognizable existence that would be swallowed by the shadow of the hero.</p><br/><p>Only those who have reached the pinnacle of power\u2014an ultimate skill\u2014could recognize her existence.</p><br/><p>She must have felt completely lost.</p><br/><p>With the power from Hinata\u2019s soul, the journey to the past. How much struggle and how harsh the journey must have been.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru, the copy of the Sacred armament that was given by you.</p><br/><p>It was given to Chloe. It came along us to the past, protecting us.</p><br/><p>The armor has helped greatly. Thank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata looked straight at me, and thanked me.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m feeling embarrassed so please stop.</p><br/><p>But, is that so\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cSo you too, had traveled to the past alongside Chloe.</p><br/><p>Thank you for looking after her.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease stop, there\u2019s no need to thank me. It was natural for me to do so.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata sidestepped my thanks.</p><br/><p>After handing over the energy of the hero\u2019s soul, all that\u2019s left now are the residues \u2015\u2015 even so, I still think that Hinata too is a hero.</p><br/><p>Hinata lost in the battle, which I must say was a little sad, however I do not believe Hinata\u2019s heart is weak.</p><br/><p>Unlike before, she had acquired true strength; she also has grown.</p><br/><p>I could not even imagine such a long journey.</p><br/><p>Hinata\u2019s explanation has also ended.</p><br/><p>But damn her story sounds real dangerous.</p><br/><p>With Hinata undergoing such ordeals, I couldn\u2019t possibly say I\u2019ve been playing around.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m glad I was able to cover it up well.</p><br/><p>I mean, I don\u2019t think it would be a big deal even if I did appear to be playing as long as I actually got serious when I needed to, but considering that I appeared to seriously be doing work when they came, I think I was able to fool them.</p><br/><p>Good thing I decided not to disclose everything.</p><br/><p>Now then, we began thinking about the contents of Hinata\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>And the most unbelievable part of the explanation is, Chloe seems to have become a hero.</p><br/><p>However, she was being manipulate by Yuuki, and had her freedom bounded until three commands are given.</p><br/><p>According to her explanation, her abilities could be considered as the strongest. She may not be able to manipulate time, however she can come close to stopping it.</p><br/><p>In order for the strongest hero to be born, she traveled through time, huh.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the world is heading towards destruction, and I died in that timeline.</p><br/><p>But, I wonder?</p><br/><p>Certainly, if it was the initial fight with Hinata, defeat is guaranteed. There\u2019s no doubt.</p><br/><p>However, I could have survived.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case\u2026\u2026no, lets stop.</p><br/><p>Conjectures on this topic would not help the current situation.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Chloe\u2019s safe. Our priority should be to rescue her.</p><br/><p>Ruminas\u2019s purpose was also to rescue Chloe; I will not hesitate to form an alliance to that end.</p><br/><p>The rest of the children were also brought here, so there\u2019s no need to worry anymore about the Ingrasia kingdom.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s now nothing stopping us from waging open war against Yuuki.</p><br/><p>\u300cYosh, I now understand the situation.</p><br/><p>We too would like to form an alliance\u300d</p><br/><p>In response to my worlds, Hinata and Ruminas nodded.</p><br/><p>Fuse appearing quite disheveled,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh my god\u2026\u2026this just became insane.</p><br/><p>Besides, how come every time I came it\u2019s always this kind of impactful serious talk.</p><br/><p>Each and every time, this isn\u2019t funny.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m just a simply branch head\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t something I should be taking on with such low pay!</p><br/><p>What terrible burden now weighs on my mind\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>He grumbled as his face kept turning paler.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, he does take on this role every time.</p><br/><p>I can understand your feeling, but lets pretend we didn\u2019t hear it just now.</p><br/><p>He still has a lot to do in the future.</p><br/><p>Thus, ignoring Fuse\u2019s wailing, the tripartite alliance of the holy kingdom Ruberius, the Western church, and the Monster Country Tempest has been formed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

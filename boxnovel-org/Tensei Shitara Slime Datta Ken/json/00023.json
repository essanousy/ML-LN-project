What rank she going to summon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...., Uh, looking at the scale of the magic, it\u2019s going to be monster with rank \u201cB+\u201d or higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDan\u2019na-kata, do not say things so leisurely, it can\u2019t be stopped!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected from skilled Adventurers.</p><br/><p>They ended the conversation in instant, and then spread out.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst! Refrain her! Mud Hand\"</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooooooo----rya!!! Heavy Collision (Knock Down)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellen makes rope to tie her, while Cabal launches a technique with his body.</p><br/><p>Guido was an equally important member; he immediately assumed guard.</p><br/><p>Fumu.</p><br/><p>Although they are only rank B, their team work is first class.</p><br/><p>There is no wasted movement.</p><br/><p>But,</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaa----! Explode!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shizu swung her finger, pointing first down and then up.</p><br/><p>And then, a small scale explosion centered on Shizu occurred.</p><br/><p>Shredding my tent to pieces.</p><br/><p>The tent aside, are any of the three injured by that explosion?</p><br/><p>As I wasn\u2019t harmed in the slightest, I wondered about them.</p><br/><p>While attempting to Knock Down Shizue, who had been restrained with Mud Hand, Cabal was blown away by the explosion.</p><br/><p>The lookout Gido sensed danger and was able to push Ellen away, saving both of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, you guys okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>I ask them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we\u2019re okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait ~u, all my body hurts! I better receive injury compensation!\u201d</p><br/><p>So, the two responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cO o it hurts-\u2026.. You guys\u2026..Please worry a bit about your leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>While complaining, Cabal stood up. What a sturdy guy!</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew Shizu-san could use magic, but even summoning\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe heck she was saying?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no\u2026 don\u2019t worry about that. As far as I know, for a summoner to use a chant is unheard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Guido stop moving when saying that, then,</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026, no way\u2026\u2026.. Explosion Monarch?\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, the situation is just as I had thought.</p><br/><p>Shizu continued to chant. As her body continued to emit red light, something began to emerge.</p><br/><p>Her mask slightly rose, and black hair freely flowed before it.</p><br/><p>What is her goal? For her appearance to become so strange suddenly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cRigurudo! Help evacuate everyone! Bring them someplace safe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an order! When you finish the evacuation, call Ranga over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAy! I have received your order!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rigurudo immediately began the evacuation.</p><br/><p>From what I can see, the goblins won\u2019t be of any help here. And, I don\u2019t plan to see them slaughtered pointless.</p><br/><p>Nor did I call Ranga to fight Shizu.</p><br/><p>The reason is simple.</p><br/><p>Perhaps these adventurers have merely set up this play to create an opportunity to strike at us.</p><br/><p>Thus, the massacre they plan to beset upon us enabled them to so freely discuss those things (no matter how trivial it actually was).</p><br/><p>So when we encircle Shizu, they could strike at us from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Gido! Explosion what-now, who\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Quickly answering his question,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is, someone who was active 50 years ago, a hero-like person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellenreceived such response.</p><br/><p>Someone famous? The moment I thought so,</p><br/><p>From Shizu\u2019s face, the mask fell.</p><br/><p>The flame rose as the wind.</p><br/><p>It swallowed Shizu, and from within a Flame Giant had appeared.</p><br/><p>Summoning Magic \u201cFlame Giant (Ifrit)\u201d! The ruler of flame swallowed all things.</p><br/><p>Voice of the World resounded.</p><br/><p>Then, Shizu\u2019s body and the Flame Giant (Ifrit) fused as one.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe~e!!! It\u2019s Ifrit, A high ranking Spirit with a rank over A!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow...., first time I see it! So~, no way to win against it, huh~!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it..... She\u2019s the Explosion Monarch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu~u-----! Don!!!</p><br/><p>Impact and heat slowly approach us.</p><br/><p>It seems the trio tried putting up a Magic Barrier, but they were blown away with a single blow.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t die, there clearly harmed.</p><br/><p>Conscious, but unable to move.</p><br/><p>In any case, they are fighting for real. No question about it.</p><br/><p>And so, I can officially ignore the possibility that they came here to wreak havoc.</p><br/><p>But, wow, that skill has considerable power.</p><br/><p>Releasing bottomless magical power, with the Flame Giant (Shizu) in the center, a scorching wind surrounded her with a diameter of 30 meters.</p><br/><p>This fellow, if I don\u2019t fight, I\u2019m a goner.</p><br/><p>However, there was something strange.</p><br/><p>Even in this situation, I did not feel any fear. Did becoming a monster cause such a change? I did feel fear of Verudora and the black snake, maybe I\u2019m just using them as a comparison.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi. What\u2019s your objective?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFu~u---!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ka~tsu!</p><br/><p>Shock!</p><br/><p>Unlike the previous explosion, she radiated a heat wave this time. However, I had already moved from that spot.</p><br/><p>With my perception speed, even if something moves at the speed of sound, I could evade it!</p><br/><p>Rather than the previous explosion, the heat wave came toward as radiation. However, I already avoid the wave.</p><br/><p>On a side note, I\u2019m glad we haven\u2019t built the city yet. Those were my sincere thoughts.</p><br/><p>Moreover, with all the trees cut down, we fought in an open area. Had we been inside a forest, it would\u2019ve caught on fire, causing me much trouble.</p><br/><p>However, don\u2019t get carried away!</p><br/><p>Bishun!!!</p><br/><p>I take aim at the abdomen, and shot \u201cWater Blade\u201d.</p><br/><p>But the attack, just before reaching the Flame Giant (Shizu), evaporated. A maelstrom of flames surrounded the Flame Giant (Shizu), protecting it.</p><br/><p>Mumu... so it seems \u201cWater Blade\u201d cannot pass through it.</p><br/><p>Would firing at full power be a good idea? So I thought, but then I imaged a steam explosion. Yeah, that won\u2019t be fun.</p><br/><p>Guess I have to resort to this.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ranga had arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou called? My lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>For now, I ordered Ranga to retrieve the three.</p><br/><p>Then,</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, quick retreat to a safe place! I\u2019ll defeat it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he nearly rejected that order,</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do as My Lord said, I wish for your fortune in battle!\u201d </p><br/><p>With those words, he left while holding the three people in his mouth.</p><br/><p>Now I can fight without reserve.</p><br/><p>The flames rage around her.</p><br/><p>Using my perception ability, I accurately grasp the distribution of heat within it.</p><br/><p>Although the Flame Giant (Shizu) was creating clones of itself and sending them to attack, I could easily predict the danger resulting from the flame\u2019s temperature.</p><br/><p>Against me, that attack will never land.</p><br/><p>But at the same time, my attack will have no effect.</p><br/><p>What a troublesome flame that is.</p><br/><p>The ground turned into magma\u2026 the temperature inside must be unbelievably high.</p><br/><p>Thus the problem: to use skills like [Paralysis Breath] or [Noxious Breath], I\u2019d need to come within ten meters of the target.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t just stroll into that place.</p><br/><p>To begin with, such as [Paralysis Breath] or [Noxious Breath], it would be necessary for the target to be within 10m when it was used.</p><br/><p>In that high temperature, it would only be a bother! I cannot afford to do that.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to class change into a Charred Slime.</p><br/><p>What should I do\u2026 neither of us can cause decisive damage on the other</p><br/><p>If this is how it ends, I should have predated more\u2026</p><br/><p>While I was deep in thought, a magic circle appeared below my feet!</p><br/><p>Dangerous!</p><br/><p>By the time my intuition scream so, I was already trapped.</p><br/><p>Wide Area Capture Barrier. Is this a special skill of the Flame Giant (Shizu)?</p><br/><p>Without a single chant, the magic circle instantly appeared.</p><br/><p>With a range of 100 meters, my body will soon turn into vapor (gas), and be consumed by the scorching heat of the flame.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the strongest fire range attack!</p><br/><p>\u201cFlare Circle\u201d</p><br/><p>She said, with voice neither feminine nor masculine, young, nor old.</p><br/><p>This is... there was no escape!</p><br/><p>I was prepared for death.</p><br/><p>Aa\u2026 I was sure I hadn\u2019t let my guard down, but I feel like I could\u2019ve done something.</p><br/><p>Maybe depending on everybody without trying to look cool\u2026</p><br/><p>Or mimicking the black wolf, using its speed, and piercing through the heat.</p><br/><p>Not wait for it to move first, not do something stupid, try to hit it with [Black Lightning]\u2026 should\u2019ve tried any one of these!</p><br/><p>Etc\u2026</p><br/><p>However, although my perception speed should be 1000 times the norm, I just don\u2019t sense the damage. </p><br/><p>Well, maybe dying without pain is a good thing.</p><br/><p>But seriously, isn\u2019t this too slow?</p><br/><p>S&amp;M play?</p><br/><p>Strange\u2026</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sure I was engulfed by the fire.</p><br/><p>Hmmm\u2026.</p><br/><p>&lt;...Solution. Due to Heat Fluctuation Resistance EX, the fire attack has been nullified&gt;</p><br/><p>Somehow, I had forgotten about Heat Fluctuation Resistance EX! Is what I felt.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t reply to every one of my thoughts! Stupid!</p><br/><p>To such abuse, I could feel it respond with a [\u2026..].</p><br/><p>Though I\u2019m surely just imaging it.</p><br/><p>There's no way [Great Sage] has developed its ego.</p><br/><p>Hahaha.</p><br/><p>Definitely just my imagination.</p><br/><p>So no problem!</p><br/><p>Well, now.</p><br/><p>Oi oi, it disables fire attacks?</p><br/><p>What? Did somebody set the mode to super easy?</p><br/><p>Is everything going according to plan?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m doomed!\u201d I cried, but soon the tables turned! Just as the theory teaches!</p><br/><p>In any case, I can now end this fight quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, what should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>I proceed to secretly, entangle the flame giant (Shizu) with [Sticky Steel Thread].</p><br/><p>In just a bit, it\u2019ll be my win.</p><br/><p>I made [Sticky Steel Thread], a combination of the Sticky and Steel Thread, which I created from days of diligent practice.</p><br/><p>Additionally, my resistance seems to be indefinitely active. In other words, I\u2019m not taking damage.</p><br/><p>Checkmate.</p><br/><p>\u201cImp, Impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time, signs of fear revealed themselves in her voice.</p><br/><p>I underestimated you, but you too underestimated me.</p><br/><p>This I\u2019ll forgive, as we are both at fault</p><br/><p>So, you\u2019re free to resent me!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it my turn next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ku~stu! The flame giant (Shizu) tried to make her escape. However, I had predicted that action.</p><br/><p>There is no escape from my [Sticky Steel Thread].</p><br/><p>Thus, I slowly walk to her.</p><br/><p>To deliver the finish blow...</p><br/><p>On the Ifrit.. who had probably possessed Shizu and manipulated her body.</p><br/><p>And without panicking.</p><br/><p>Unable to run away nor even struggle, such a pitiful creature I approach.</p><br/><p>And Then, </p><br/><p>The answer, of course, is YES!</p><br/><p>The dazzling light wraps around us.... and then suddenly disappears.</p><br/><p>The remaining actors: me and an old woman.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

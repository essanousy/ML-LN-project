Not just people with high ability but those with knowledge and those familiar with technology as well. Since I was mainly obsessed with food, I could learn something from this.</p><br/><p>To be honest, there was no satisfaction in a meal at the level of a frontier village. Modern Japan was too luxurious.</p><br/><p>Only one boiled potato every day and a tasteless soup made with bitter grass. Such meal was the norm.</p><br/><p>Because salt was a high-class item, food that had flavor was precious.</p><br/><p>Even bread, since it was eaten when hard, would be nothing more than a hardship.To try and improve the food was a very natural action, but whether or not it was possible was different issue.</p><br/><p>Just like with me, the images formed with the knowledge of the former world might not be conveyed properly to the other party. It would be certain that there would be many attempted trial and errors between a \u201cWorld Traveler\u201d with common sense and the other party.</p><br/><p>I could pretty much estimate that much.</p><br/><p>Thanks to their efforts, I could eat a cake, even in this world.</p><br/><p>Although the reason I came to Ingrasia Kingdom\u2019s royal capital was to participate in the Council\u2019s conference, I believed this issue could be more important than that.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s goal was negotiating with the shopkeeper to see if he would share his recipe.</p><br/><p>Shuna said she could make an identical cake, but it would require several months of research in order to make one at the same level.</p><br/><p>I greeted Kirsch-san,[1] the shopkeeper. I wanted to ask him to teach Shuna how to make it.</p><br/><p>The recipe might have been a secret, but even if it was useless, I had continued to ask him.</p><br/><p>\u300cAah? You want learn how to make my cake?</p><br/><p>Do you think a treasured recipe can be taught to other so easily?!</p><br/><p>I\u2019m glad that you liked the cake, but this was made with the effort of many people.</p><br/><p>So it can\u2019t be taught to others so easily.\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh well, it was a natural reaction.</p><br/><p>There are similar shops in many places in this town, but after my eating spree and comparing them to each other, only this shop had the real deal. </p><br/><p>It was certain that the other shops only imitated this shop. This shopkeeper could also be another \u201cWorld Traveler.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300cCould you please do something about that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Shuna asked politely while lowering her head.</p><br/><p>It was a refined movement that placed her both hands together and bent at the waist beautifully, charmed all who saw it.</p><br/><p>\u300c......guu. I, I won\u2019t fall to sucha seductive technique!</p><br/><p>But, I will think about it, if you can make a dish that can satisfy me, anything is ok.\u300d</p><br/><p>Oops.</p><br/><p>It seems Shuna was able to draw out a compromise. I was prepared to have to research it in the worst case scenario, but Shuna\u2019s dishes are first class.</p><br/><p>It might go well.</p><br/><p>\u300cShuna-san. Cook to your heart\u2019s content and end this!</p><br/><p>Make that conceited shopkeeper moan by the supreme dish!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. I understand!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shuna was motivated.</p><br/><p>The cake had instigated a fire in Shuna\u2019s spirit.</p><br/><p>Shuna borrowed the kitchen and prepared the supreme dish.</p><br/><p>It was Tamagoyaki[2].</p><br/><p>The supreme dish, that was said could make someone understand the cook\u2019s skill, was Tamagoyaki.</p><br/><p>Kirsch-san stared at the given plate and gulping, he swallowed his saliva. Saying nothing, with a fork, he put a mouthful Tamagoyaki into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300cDelicious!!\u300d</p><br/><p>It was a single blow.</p><br/><p>With Shuna\u2019s dish\u2019s overwhelming power, Kirsch-san acknowledged Shuna.</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much\u300d</p><br/><p>A charming smile floated on Shuna\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Things had concluded. As the smile pierced his heart, Kirsch-san seemed to fall completely.</p><br/><p>\u300cTchi. It can\u2019t be help! It\u2019s a special occasion, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>The muscular Ossan responded to Shuna with a shy smile.</p><br/><p>Honestly, I could only say he was acting dere-dere[3]. Oh well, it couldn\u2019t be helped, Shuna\u2019s pale pink hair suited her well, and she was a lovely girl.</p><br/><p>Kirsch began to teach Shuna how to make the cake in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Benimaru and I ordered a drink similar to coffee from the clerk, and thought about the conference earlier while waiting for Shuna.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When I had arrived at the assembly hall where the conference was held, several Council members came to greet me.</p><br/><p>I heard many stories from the people who came to visit the Tournament, it seemed they wanted to tie diplomatic relations with me.</p><br/><p>I considered the future appeal and interacted sociably with them.</p><br/><p>\u300cAhahahaha. Rimuru-dono, though you are called a Demon Lord, aren\u2019t you very sociable!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh my, you\u2019re quite right. From now on please call me as you see fit.</p><br/><p>By the way, I hear that you produce many interesting items?</p><br/><p>Would you mind allowing our country to handle those goods?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, about that. We\u2019re in the feel the same. We also expect your cooperation.</p><br/><p>Of course, the appropriate remuneration would be\u2015\u2015saying more than this would be tasteless, right\u300d</p><br/><p>Ah, yes.</p><br/><p>What should I call it...this speechless feeling? </p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t even being rude anymore!</p><br/><p>I had believed the other party might have been a noble, it might have been a failure for me to act modestly. It seemed they had misunderstood my response considerably.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it was troublesome. Even if I didn\u2019t particularly distribute goods to these fellows, it could still be distributed by the guild\u2015\u2015as the organization under the Arbitration committee.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, is that so. Please take care of me at that time\u300d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s go with a strategy of juggling conversations without any meaning.</p><br/><p>This was a conversation between adults. It was a talk of \u201cIf you want to buy something, come buy it yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>I refused the impolite Council member with a smile and left the place after I had finished giving light greetings.</p><br/><p>In the midst of a lengthy talk, another committee member also approached.</p><br/><p>Although my mood had been ruined since the morning, I endured since I could possibly request something here, and entered the meeting place.</p><br/><p>And then the conference began...from then on was the true hell.</p><br/><p>At the last meeting, the agenda Hinata had proposed was to appeal for our cooperation. I had heard it from her.</p><br/><p>The defense would be entrusted to our country, and a constant amount of money would be paid. Given that the other party was certainly going to use us, we too would use the other party.</p><br/><p>Oh well, we were equal in this regard. Anyway we were located on the Empire\u2019s invasion route. If the war happened, it was natural for the rear to work together.</p><br/><p>Also, if they paid the defense fee, of course I would accept. I didn\u2019t have any reason to refuse.</p><br/><p>And then there was the real issue.</p><br/><p>The purpose of participating in this conference was to make them a hand over their surplus forces.</p><br/><p>In other words, I would show off the monster\u2019s power and the powerful military strength in my possession.</p><br/><p>Each country would pay us their defense budget, and we would be used for good. However, in fact each country possessed large military forces, their size enabled each country to ignore Tempest.</p><br/><p>Tempest had already been recognized as a country. Because we were aiming for co-existence and co-prosperity with human society we should hesitate to hold a role of the defense force for the Confederation.</p><br/><p>Besides, by giving support it would be possible to demonstrate our military force to watchful eyes of many countries. It was a strategy that killed two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>Hinata had said that she had also aimed for this.</p><br/><p>The soldiers under the direct control of the committee only included a few Holy Knights. Therefore, by building a base for us, they could entrust the emergency response to us.</p><br/><p>I approved of that plan, even if I was being used by others I had also intended to make a profit off of them.</p><br/><p>How did things turn out like this?</p><br/><p>The desk I had kicked up was floating in the air and when it fell I pulverized into very small piece with my heel.</p><br/><p>I crossed my legs, sat on the chair arrogantly, and glared at the Council members who turned pale. They looked at me in surprise and I let out a sigh in my mind.</p><br/><p>No, I had endured it at first.</p><br/><p>Even as an adult, I was considered someone with a heart wider than a sea. I could even brag that this was as famous as the stories of my recent activities.</p><br/><p>As someone who was called the embodiment of patience, dealing with the Milim\u2019s selfishness was my forte. Because I had a vast, spacious heart, I could even laugh and forgive Milim\u2019s selfishness.</p><br/><p>But...</p><br/><p>What about the committee ossans[4] and their selfishness covered in greed that didn\u2019t have any charm?</p><br/><p>The answer to that was the large desk that was crushed before their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, you guys. Are you making fun of me?</p><br/><p>Saying whatever you please, am I your servant?</p><br/><p>Aah? Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know even though I remained silent!\u300d</p><br/><p>In the conference room that had fallen silent, my voice resounded calmly.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t shout but my voice seemed to inflict the mind of the Council member with fear.</p><br/><p>I also did not use the\u300eDemon Lord\u2019s Haki\u300f.</p><br/><p>Because, if I used it on human, the best case would be they panicked, and the worst case would be they become insane and died in madness.</p><br/><p>The brainwashing series was usable, but all possibilities of friendship with humans would vanish if I used it. I didn\u2019t have the hobby of spending time with uninteresting dolls that can only answer YES for the remainder of its life.</p><br/><p>In other words, I only got angry and broke the desk this time, it was just a normal intimidation tactic.</p><br/><p>But, the effect was still great. </p><br/><p>\u300cNo, no,Rimuru-dono We didn\u2019t say it with such an intent...\u300d</p><br/><p>In the first place, it was that.</p><br/><p>To address someone of a higher standing and a King of a country with \u201cDono\u201d.</p><br/><p>Even if we held the status of a country, they only treated me like the king of a vassal nation, not as equal country.</p><br/><p>I was sure these fellows were looking down on monsters.</p><br/><p>And the contents of the discussion from a while ago...</p><br/><p>Geez, share the blueprints for the magic train, give the rights for joint management of the labyrinth, hands over the tax from the people who lived in the satellite town and not the citizens of Tempest\u2026</p><br/><p>It was just stating their selfish demands.</p><br/><p>I was a Demon Lord, for cripes sake! Because of this, I expected to be treated with proper respect, however they were just acting in an extremely unreasonable manner.</p><br/><p>Even if they were nobles who represented their nations, my generous heart had reached its limit.</p><br/><p>No, I would say that Yuuki was quite a clever fox if he could lead such tanukis[5] by the nose. It was impossible for me.</p><br/><p>\u300aNotification. Therefore, I told you I would be the one represent it\u300b</p><br/><p>Raphael seemed to say something but it might just have been my imagination.</p><br/><p>Raphael-san who was just a skill should not have able to intrude freely to such an extent.</p><br/><p>I was too angry and seemed to have heard an auditory hallucination. But, it was good since it allowed me to collect myself a little.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Then, what kind of intent of what you want to relay?</p><br/><p>Are you telling me to work like a carriage horse as your guys slave?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN, no! That\u2019s unthinkable! We don\u2019t have such intent...\u300d</p><br/><p>I shifted my focus onto the Council member who had spoken franticly, and suddenly I had an odd feeling.</p><br/><p>That fellow\u2019s eyes were facing towards the inner part of the conference room\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>When I listened carefully, I heard several footsteps. Apparently, he seemed to have called the guard.</p><br/><p>When I noticed that, the door was flung open and several soldiers and a large man entered. </p><br/><p>\u300cOh oh, so energetic. Are you an idiot to call yourself a Demon Lord?</p><br/><p>But, you only brought three attendants, aren\u2019t you bragging too much?</p><br/><p>Stupid!</p><br/><p>If I beat you and put you under my thumb, you monsters will be at my mercy!\u300d</p><br/><p>The large man immediately barked loudly as he entered.</p><br/><p>Eh? What?</p><br/><p>You\u2019re going to beat me and turn me into your minion?</p><br/><p>What is this fellow talking about? Did I become dumb? I didn\u2019t really understand what this fellow was saying.</p><br/><p>\u300aSolution. This large man (Fool), says that he will win against master and turn you into a minion\u300b</p><br/><p>I could understand that!</p><br/><p>If it was explained one on one with serious look, I would be really dumb.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi..... Is this the consensus of the assembly?\u300d</p><br/><p>In reply to the question posed by my tired self,</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you an idiot? Of course it is! Or, are you frightened?</p><br/><p>If you grovel and lick my shoes now, I won\u2019t make you feel pain.\u300d</p><br/><p>The large man answered with vulgar laughter.</p><br/><p>But amongst the Council members there were some who were stiffin fear and confusion,</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn\u2019t hear about this. What is this about?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWho instigated this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat soldier is wearing armor bearing the crest of the Ingrasia royal family.</p><br/><p>That means, this is Ingrasia\u2019s instigation?\u300d</p><br/><p>I was able to hear such response from an obviously unrelated, a perplexed person and a person who had made a calm judgment.</p><br/><p>That meant that this matter is not a decision by the assembly, it was just a reckless show of power? Oh well, it seemed Hinata didn\u2019t know about this, and it was certainly not a unanimous decision either.</p><br/><p>I made such a judgment.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, don\u2019t enter without permission.</p><br/><p>The Council\u2019s assembly hall is in the middle of a conference right now.</p><br/><p>You guys, this is not behavior becoming of a soldier\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata calmly demanded the large man and his group to leave.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, Hinata-dono. It\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>It is I[6] who called them. It\u2019s to teach that outlaw a lesson\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGavan-dono[7], did you lose your mind?</p><br/><p>Though I didn\u2019t hear about this before.......</p><br/><p>Or rather, didn\u2019t you guys hand the authority of the Council\u2019s decision over to me?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata\u2019s voice lowered and become cold.</p><br/><p>Ah, she seemed to be quite seriously angry. I thought it was certainly due to that fool\u2019s judgment.</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up, woman. Ah?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re the former Holy Knight leader or what, but I am the leader of the Ingrasia Chivalric Guard Order, Reiner-sama[8] is not your enemy.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you wet yourself with piss running away after being defeated by that meager Demon Lord? Right, oh Holy Knight Leader-sama.</p><br/><p>Anyway, that position too was merely a decoration you obtained after seducing a sex-minded cardinal.[9]</p><br/><p>Even if a small fry fought you, it would be a poor and boring fight. To lack the resolution to kill the Demon Lord, it\u2019s ridiculous!</p><br/><p>But well...your appearance isn\u2019t that bad. If you want to become my woman, it would be okay for me to love you as my beloved concubine\u300d</p><br/><p>Ah, this fellow is dead meat.</p><br/><p>Hinata\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. Her cold, beautiful face was like normal.</p><br/><p>However, contrasting with her cold outward appearance, inside she seemed to be raging like magma.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhoa, Reiner-kyou[10]. Isn\u2019t that a little vulgar?</p><br/><p>Still, I\u2019m interested in the Demon Lord as well. Monopolizing it wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>I forgot to mention it, but this Sir Reiner is an A rank Adventurer that could also defeat the Hero.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s stronger than you all, no matter how many of you there are.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t be conceited when you\u2019re just have a little bit of strength.\u300d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, as that was announced in a loud voice, a hard to describe chill ran down my back.</p><br/><p>It was disgusting. This ossan could even provoke me who was difficult to provoke. What a terrible talent.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Oi, you all... Is that, the decision of the Ingrasia Kingdom?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata asked in a calm voice that didn\u2019t let you feel her anger.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu, that\u2019s right. Since the Council, already has passed its decision.</p><br/><p>Well, though the voting is going to start now.\u300d</p><br/><p>A blond young man stood up and said that.</p><br/><p>The meeting hall was filled with commotion and excitement.</p><br/><p>\u300cElric-ouji[11]\u2015\u2015. Is this by your instigation?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, Hinata. You should sit\u300d</p><br/><p>Prince.....?</p><br/><p>This idiot, no, this prince, is the mastermind behind this?</p><br/><p>He seemed to be the prince of Ingrasia Kingdom, but this fellow seemed to have somehow incited several Council members.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, let\u2019s vote.</p><br/><p>I will defeat the Demon Lord on this place and make it our minion.</p><br/><p>Anyone that agrees, stand up!\u300d</p><br/><p>The prince\u2019s voice had echoed loudly, and the majority of the Council member stood up, wearing disgusting smiles.</p><br/><p>It seemed they had communicated secretly and had a discussion.</p><br/><p>The financial situation of each country, the responses of the royal families, as well as the records of proceedings in each country\u2019s assembly and so forth, I had Souei investigate them all thoroughly.</p><br/><p>However, I hadn\u2019t thought that the Council members would have been bribed individually. It was a failure on my part not to expect such possibility.</p><br/><p>\u300aNotification. Nay, there\u2019s no problem. It\u2019s within expectations.\u300b</p><br/><p>Eh? Within expectations?</p><br/><p>I felt like I saw an illusion of Raphael sprouting a dark smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, this is\u300d</p><br/><p>Souei handed me several account books.</p><br/><p>Ah........it\u2019s the secret accounts. Was it seriously within expectations?</p><br/><p>Before anyone realized, I had secured the account book which listed the bribes and so forth of the Council members that were in collusion.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a blunder-less performance.</p><br/><p>The number of account books was in accordance to the number of Council members that stood up at Prince Elric\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>This was nothing but a farce since I had already obtained unshakeable evidence.</p><br/><p>The remaining Council members that had not stood up, perplexedly asked the others,</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn\u2019t heard this!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEven though His Majesty Rimuru especially came here by himself, this treatment will be a problem!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSomething like this should not be permitted. For what reason is there a Council if there\u2019s no fairness!\u300d</p><br/><p>They raged and felt offended.</p><br/><p>Now, the seated Council members did not seem like they were flexible nor like they had fair dispositions.</p><br/><p>I knew it was because they seemed to address me using appropriate manners.</p><br/><p> It was uncertain whether the country that those Council members represented were upright or not, but I thought I was more likely to trust them than the countries that sent malfeasant Council members with unacceptable manners.</p><br/><p>Anyway, because a Council member is the representative of a country, then the person represents the country. </p><br/><p>\u300cThe vote is out. Because it exceeded the majority, the hall has approved this agenda!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elated by their success, Prince Elric declared that loudly.</p><br/><p>The Council members who followed applauded.</p><br/><p>The Council members that had remaining seated hung their heads, while Hinata watched the farce with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>Because carrying a weapon was not permitted she was unarmed, however if she had held a sword now, she would have been gripping the hilt strongly. </p><br/><p>\u300cWell now that permission has been given, choose whether you want to lick my shoes or feel pain\u300d</p><br/><p>The fool called Reiner stood before me and said that.</p><br/><p>Hinata looked at me. She seemed to be calculating how to move depending on my response.</p><br/><p>Well then.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, I want to confirm something. Is that okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAah? What is?</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, you guys decision. Is it okay if I take this as the country\u2019s decision?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHha! Are you an idiot? Such a thing now, what abou\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Shuna stood up, took out a folding fan and brandished it.</p><br/><p>With just that, Reiner who was in the middle of talking was sent flying. He was cowering after he crashed into the wall, knocking over chair and desk in the process.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve been enduring, listening to all this since a little while ago....</p><br/><p>Yo, you bastards, to Rimuru-sama that we respect and love, ho-how impolite.....\u300d</p><br/><p>Shuna approached Reiner calmly.</p><br/><p>Ah, it seemed it wasn\u2019t just me who was furious.</p><br/><p>Or rather, when another person exploded, I quickly calmed down.</p><br/><p>When I looked around, my eyes caught Hinata\u2019s, did she calm down too? I felt that we could communicate with our eyes. </p><br/><p>\u300cTrash. I will not kill you so quickly. If I\u2019m not mistaken, you had said that you were A rank.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll allow you to be serious.</p><br/><p>Well now, stand up and come at me\u300d</p><br/><p>She pointed the folding fan at Reiner, and Shuna sent him a killer glare. </p><br/><p>\u300cRe-Reiner! What are you idling for!? Quickly silence that insolent woman.</p><br/><p>You must also defeat that Demon Lord. There\u2019s no time for fooling around!\u300d</p><br/><p>Prince Elric who could not understand the situation, commanded Reiner to attack.</p><br/><p>But, Reiner didn\u2019t move an inch.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you not coming? Then I will\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>When Shuna was about to take a single step,</p><br/><p>\u300cHi, hii\u30fc\u30fc!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Reiner was cowering while holding his head with both hands.</p><br/><p>From his groin, steaming liquid was leaking out.</p><br/><p>Whoa, did he just wet himself? I was so astounded that I couldn\u2019t find any words to say.</p><br/><p>\u300cShuna, withdraw\u300d</p><br/><p>Shuna nodded at my order and she returned to her position behind me.</p><br/><p>Reiner began to cry like a child, slobbering with tears while cowering.</p><br/><p>The match was already over. His opponent was too absurd.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, Elric was it?</p><br/><p>You picked a fight with me, but what will you do from now on?</p><br/><p>You guys too, your countries seem to approve this matter as well.</p><br/><p>The same offense, is that alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s face became pale and their heads hung down when I asked them that with a smile.</p><br/><p>The match was decided. The reason these dullard fellow lost was because they had thought that a small fry could defeat a Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>No, the Ingrasia Kingdom didn\u2019t border the Great Jura Forest. Therefore they didn\u2019t know the threat of monsters.</p><br/><p>The Council members that approved of the agreement this time were from small countries belonging to Ingrasia\u2019s clique. The countries\u2019 intents and the Council members\u2019 intents were different, but their contempt for monsters may be the same.</p><br/><p>After all, nobles were beings that only thought about themselves. Oh well, though there seems to be a person who changed with the country among them. It would be better for me to have a second thought before associating with such country.</p><br/><p>Because I only saw the document and deal with it unseriously, it might be better for me to review it later.</p><br/><p>After all of that, the important agenda was approved and accepted by the Council members after I threaten them.</p><br/><p>1. Military cooperation with Tempest.</p><br/><p>1. Internal Passage Permit for the Tempest army.</p><br/><p>1. Official participation in Confederation Council for Tempest.</p><br/><p>1. The relocation of the Confederation Council\u2019s headquarters to Tempest.</p><br/><p>1. The relocation of the Freedom Arbitration Committee\u2019s headquarters to Tempest.</p><br/><p>Forcibly making them sign it, everything passed without a hitch.</p><br/><p>With unanimous consent.</p><br/><p>Outfoxing them, and using tricks wasn\u2019t something I was suited for.</p><br/><p>As a result, I had simply controlled them using physical strength, and all the issues were resolved. The one who throw the hit wasn\u2019t me, so I was satisfied since it seemed to prove my open mindedness.</p><br/><p>Thus, the assembly ended without an issue, and we left the assembly hall. </p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh well, this was the whole story.</p><br/><p>Prince Elric, the Ossan named Gavan who was a minister of Ingrasia, and the council members as well.</p><br/><p>They were dumbfounded, they seemed frightened by the seriousness of the matter, but they reap what they sow.</p><br/><p>Naturally, I gave Souei an order the moment the conference had ended. I had ordered him to deliver an account book to each of their countries. With this, the rude and idiotic people would be purged.</p><br/><p>Even if they were forgiven, they would be fired, it could be said it was a dead end for them.</p><br/><p>And also, the Ingrasia Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Because of its facilitated transportation, this country had been the center of peace for many countries.</p><br/><p>Even though the technology was remarkable, it didn\u2019t mean the productivity was high.</p><br/><p>The culture level was high, but it was no more than reproduction by Yuuki so that \u201cOther Worlders\u201d could live comfortably.</p><br/><p>Since an important institution like the council and the committee, would be relocating, its role as the center of many countries had already ended.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t do anything, as it was, they would surely begin to decline.</p><br/><p>Even so that was a natural consequence, so there wasn\u2019t any need for me to feel bad.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, Tempest becoming the center, even I approve of that\u300d</p><br/><p>Those were Hinata\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>If she had said that, it was clear what would happen to Ingrasia Kingdom. Hinata didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>On this matter, Hinata\u2019s decision was final. She had quickly returned and began to prepare the relocation. Well, Hinata might have been angrier than me.</p><br/><p>I thought about it while drinking the pseudo coffee.</p><br/><p>\u300cOr rather, I was able to have a good experience this time\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I was too angry too, I might not have understood what happened since I was raging too much.</p><br/><p>If Shuna had moved even a little slower, all the humans in that room would have burnt into nothingness\u300d</p><br/><p>Buu[12]! So I spray out the coffee I drank.</p><br/><p>I was admiring Benimaru since he\u2019d become an adult. I had thought he had gone quiet, but he was just about to lose control of himself in the anger.</p><br/><p>I felt that I had lost that admiration. Or rather, that was dangerous. I would have become the enemy of mankind if a mass slaughter had happened in that place.</p><br/><p>\u300cOioi, you must absolutely prevent that!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, it\u2019s just a joke. I\u2019m not serious!\u300d</p><br/><p>Though Benimaru had tried to deceive me with a refreshing smile, I wasn\u2019t going to be deceived.</p><br/><p>This guy was deadly serious.</p><br/><p>For the next conference, I think it would be necessary carefully consider the personnel I brought.</p><br/><p>Then,</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, I did it!</p><br/><p>Kirsch-tenchou[13] decided to come to Tempest!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shuna returned, and reported to me with a full smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I heard that he was going to close the shop and go into retirement\u2015\u2015,</p><br/><p>He seemed willing to come when I invited him!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m serious!\u300d</p><br/><p>Wonderful.</p><br/><p>With this, as long as I prepared sugar, eating cake every day was no longer a dream.</p><br/><p>No, as long as there were ingredients, could I not assemble any kind of cake?!</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s wonderful, as expected from Shuna!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I praised her, Shuna nodded with smile.</p><br/><p>This time Shuna had played a very active part.</p><br/><p>This is in great contrast to a certain disappointing secretary. If it was that disappointing secretary, even when going easy she might kill Reiner.</p><br/><p>And then after using skillful deception, it would likely become something terrible. Oh well, that wasn\u2019t limited to Shion, but included me as well.</p><br/><p>This time, thanks to Shuna, the negotiations were easily completed.</p><br/><p>But, her greatest accomplishment was that she was able to persuade that stubborn Oyaji[14].</p><br/><p>I had asked him earnestly before, but he hadn\u2019t budged at all.</p><br/><p>She did a good job. </p><br/><p>Thus the conference ended safely as well, and we returned home to Tempest.</p><br/><p>Various things had happened, but the greatest result, It went without saying, was that cake would now be included as the dessert every day.</p><br/><p>Guro's Comment</p><br/><p>They were Idiot to think that they can make our sacred slime as their minion (Actually, it's Yes-man). And I learn that Cake is more important than Diplomatic relations etc </p><br/><p>So see you next chapter!</p><br/><p>[1] \u30ae\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5Girushu \u2013 other alternatives Gilsh/Girsch/Gilush/Kilsch.</p><br/><p>[2] Tamagoyaki or Japanese Omelet which is made by rolling together several layers of cooked egg.

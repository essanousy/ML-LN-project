I\u2019m pleased to say that we found no abnormalities.</p><br/><p>Clown: Doctor! How do you tell a difference between an oral thermometer and a rectal one?</p><br/><p>Doctor: Hmm? Oh, well the simplest method would be\u2013</p><br/><p>Clown: By the taste!</p><br/><p>Doctor: \u2026 Were you listening to what I was saying before?</p><br/><p>Clown: About what?</p><br/><p>Doctor: Your recovery from that accident. Could I ask you a few questions?</p><br/><p>Clown: How many is a few?</p><br/><p>Doctor: A three or four, maybe. Have you been feeling stressed lately?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: No! I didn\u2019t give you my permission to ask questions!</p><br/><p>Doctor: Oh, I apologize. May I ask a question?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: That is in itself a question! But fine, go ahead.</p><br/><p>Doctor: So, are you feeling okay?</p><br/><p>Clown: Yes, absolutely. No problems at all.</p><br/><p>Doctor: Have you been able to remember anything since before the accident?</p><br/><p>Clown: \u2026 what?</p><br/><p>Doctor: You haven\u2019t forgotten about it, have you?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Doctor, I\u2019m getting a headache listening to you. Can we leave now?</p><br/><p>Doctor: We?</p><br/><p>Clown: Oh, since we\u2019re leaving now, let me tell you one more joke. Did you know? A doctor is the only man who can tell a woman to take off all her clothes and then send a bill to her husband!</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Life in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>051. To the Human City</p><br/><p>Two weeks have passed since we let Youmu\u2019s group in.</p><br/><p>The highway plan is continuing smoothly.</p><br/><p>Contrary to what you\u2019d think, the frontier garrison members are rather hardworking.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve also gotten very friendly with the hobgoblin guardians.</p><br/><p>The city\u2019s monsters are dutifully upholding the rules, and are unexpectedly friendly towards the humans.</p><br/><p>I was expecting the guardians and the garrison to look down on each other due to monster-human animosity and all, but I guess I was wrong.</p><br/><p>Probably, since they used to be ruffians and hooligans, they are trying to change.</p><br/><p>As for Youmu, he might be the kind of person who attracts people.</p><br/><p>He has an aura of charisma about him.</p><br/><p>So even dividing up the responsibilities he was handed was quite smooth\u2013whether or not his desire to cooperate with us affected his efficiency.</p><br/><p>We have goblin riders on guard and lookout duty around the city, but there\u2019s simply too many of them.</p><br/><p>Therefore, we decided to have ten riders support the frontier garrison when they answered distress calls.</p><br/><p>For the humans that assistance was something they wouldn\u2019t even dare to ask for, so they happily accepted.</p><br/><p>However, they insisted to return to the favor, so they decided to teach us formation tactics, sword skills, and other professions they knew.</p><br/><p>Among those was a rather popular survival skills that were bound to increase our food variety.</p><br/><p>While it wouldn\u2019t lead to abundance, it is something we can be grateful for.</p><br/><p>Thus our relationship kept improving.</p><br/><p>And once we more or less came to trust each other, the garrison had a proposal\u2026 no, a favor to ask.</p><br/><p>They asked whether we could maintain their equipment. It seems the fact that our equipment is far superior to theirs has been bothering them.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn the first place, it\u2019s plain cheating for monsters to use high level equipment!\u300d</p><br/><p>One of their members said, speaking on behalf of the entire group.</p><br/><p>Frankly, I agree.</p><br/><p>Since getting the Dwarfs\u2019 technological assistance we\u2019ve been able to create equipment far above what I would consider ideal.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufun! Well, hey. Dwarf armor is the best in the world!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaijin merrily replied,</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, no\u2026 that being so, why is even master Garm in this city? That I find strange!\u300d</p><br/><p>Cabal also expressed disbelief.</p><br/><p>The elite among the dwarfs\u2013Garm. Kaijin is also a master of his craft, and we also have the expert Kurobee.</p><br/><p>Our city\u2019s smithy would easily match that of any capital city.</p><br/><p>Moreover, we have Gabil bringing raw materials from the cave once in a while; so we have an abundance of high ranking ingredients.</p><br/><p>If people learned of this, there would bound to be plenty of buyers; however, we don\u2019t plan to sell any.</p><br/><p>There are still hobgoblins without a complete set of equipment. Our numbers are so large that we are having hard time meeting demand.</p><br/><p>Even with Kurobee\u2019s copy skill \u2013 the one he got from\u300eResearcher\u300f- it takes a while to finish an item since its not accelerated by\u300eGreat Sage\u300flike mine.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s certainly faster than if making the item by hand, but he\u2019s still just a single person.</p><br/><p>Thus, he\u2019s been employing artisan-wannabees from among the young men and women to become his disciples; and has been producing all items at the factories for them to see.</p><br/><p>Perhaps one of these young ones may become a true artisan someday.</p><br/><p>So, considering the possibility of future experts, Kurobee\u2019s current actions are for the best in the long term.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhatever, it\u2019s fine\u2013your request! Ask me to look at your equipment any time I\u2019m free!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaijin lightly accepted.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s probably planning on using them to have his students practice.</p><br/><p>He might look like a big softy, but he\u2019s actually an extremely prudent old man.</p><br/><p>\u300cUooooooo! As expected of Kaijin-san! Look at him talk!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOi oi, you sure?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, look at mine too!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He was surrounded in other similar joyous shouts.</p><br/><p>I guess I should feel relieved at his kindness.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>*Dosu, Zusha, Boko, Bokon!*</p><br/><p>That was the sound that accompanied our fall.</p><br/><p>By \u201cour fall\u201d I mean mine, Benimaru\u2019s, Souei\u2019s, and Shion\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u300cWahahaha! You suck, you suck, you suck, you suck!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Our opponent exclaimed while laughing loudly. Who? Demon Lord Milim of course.</p><br/><p>We had a mock battle with her, four versus one, but that didn\u2019t go over well.</p><br/><p>And she\u2019s even using her dragon knuckles. She always wears them. Once at mealtime I made her take them off causing her to sulk the rest of the day.</p><br/><p>I shouldn\u2019t have? No, that was clearly a breach of etiquette.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m glad I had her wear them this time.</p><br/><p>She should always wear them during practice. But that doesn\u2019t apply to mealtime.</p><br/><p>As if receiving a lesson, I spar daily with Milim.</p><br/><p>But she\u2019s so strong \u2013 to the point that it\u2019s funny! \u2013 that dueling her is out of the question. So, we decided on this four versus one.</p><br/><p>Ridiculous power. A cheat-like ability. Bottomless stamina.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m glad we\u2019re not enemies.</p><br/><p>We also had Hakurou spar with her once. Unfortunately, not even his attacks reach her. However he can put up a fight, which is impressive in itself.</p><br/><p>The overwhelming power I felt from the Dwarf King, and the overwhelming power from Milim.</p><br/><p>The difference between them is far too great. That much I understood after being beaten down in succession here.</p><br/><p>Had I, during the match with the dwarf king, used\u300eGreat Sage\u300fbattle mode, there\u2019s a chance I could have won.</p><br/><p>But that kind of thing is meaningless before Milim. It\u2019s not a match of skill or trick.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s various kinds of strength, huh\u2026?</p><br/><p>Thus thrice a day. As a result, we\u2019ve all gotten much stronger compared to two weeks ago.</p><br/><p>Hakurou observes the matches. He\u2019s perfected his skills, so he won\u2019t benefit much from these.</p><br/><p>As for us, our skills were so lacking, that we managed to improve greatly these past two weeks.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019ve gotten pretty good! If Rimuru decided to become a demon lord now, I would be totally for it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim happily exclaimed.</p><br/><p>I am not planning on becoming a demon lord!</p><br/><p>Besides, we didn\u2019t even last twenty minutes today. Complete failures.</p><br/><p>Even if I called myself a demon lord, I wouldn\u2019t live long enough to see it recorded.</p><br/><p>Benimaru, Souei, and Shion return to practice after getting instructions from Hakurou.</p><br/><p>What a lively bunch they are.</p><br/><p>While watching them spar,</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Milim, why did you become a demon lord?\u300d</p><br/><p>I suddenly got curious and asked,</p><br/><p>\u300cYeaaaah, about that\u2026 what was the reason again? There was a bunch of sad things and messed up things, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy are you asking me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo reason. Can\u2019t remember it well. It\u2019s been too long ago; I forgot!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim looked as if she didn\u2019t want to remember the grief and horror.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. Well, if you forgot, there\u2019s no need to remember!\u300d</p><br/><p>Though she looks like a child, she is an ancient demon lord.</p><br/><p>From what I heard, the youngest of demon lords is at least 200 years old.</p><br/><p>That would be my enemy Leon Cromwell. My prey.</p><br/><p>There are other young demon lords; they are around five hundred years old and have experienced the great war.</p><br/><p>Milim belongs to the old generation.</p><br/><p>In other words, she\u2019s been living for an insane amount of time.</p><br/><p>Chances are, she doesn\u2019t have many friends. She\u2019s been living for so long that she must have lost many good friends by now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, do you have family or someone who worries about you?</p><br/><p>Is it okay to stay here without letting anyone know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Suddenly growing worried, I asked her.</p><br/><p>When I did,</p><br/><p>\u300cAh!!! I forgot. Right\u2026 I\u2019ll be right back!</p><br/><p>Though this might take a while. But, I\u2019ll be gone for 2~3 years at the longest. I\u2019ll be back!\u300d</p><br/><p>She suddenly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? So suddenly. Hey. Right now?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMu, yeah. Well, it\u2019s not like we won\u2019t meet again\uff01So I\u2019m off!\u300d</p><br/><p>She said, and immediately changed into her Gothic Dress.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s with the Dress Change magic\u2013a very useful skill.</p><br/><p>I would have asked her to teach me, but I can do that naturally myself, so there\u2019s no need.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s usually recommended to people with lots of equipment. Though you have to learn\u3008Spacial Magic\u3009before this one, and it is far harder to learn.</p><br/><p>After she finished changing, she looked at me with a smile,</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, be right back!\u300d</p><br/><p>She flew off after saying just a few words.</p><br/><p>And without making a sound she flew away at a speed faster than the speed of sound.</p><br/><p>She left as suddenly as she had arrived.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Has Milim-sama gone off somewhere?\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion asked.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. She had remembered some unfinished business. She\u2019ll be back in 2~3 years at the latest, she said.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c2~3 years? How easily she went on such an arduous journey, and for such a long time, no?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, to someone with her lifespan, surely it\u2019s but 2~3 days?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI guess it is!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMaybe she\u2019s gone off to show off her clothing and dragon knuckles to her friends\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion muttered that last line much to the approval of the other oni.</p><br/><p>That just might be the case.</p><br/><p>If she went showing off her gifts to her friends around the world, she might just need 2~3 years for that.</p><br/><p>Though our imagination was probably just running wild imagining such a scene, we somehow became convinced that she is in fact out boasting to friends.</p><br/><p>Solemn expressions don\u2019t suit Milim.</p><br/><p>And now that she\u2019s gone, I\u2019m feeling kind of lonely. We\u2019ve gotten that close during these two measly weeks.</p><br/><p>What a strange demon lord she is.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s no time to feel sorry for ourselves.</p><br/><p>Her departure is also a chance.</p><br/><p>We must go to a human village right now. After checking it out, if there are no problems, I\u2019ll take Milim there next time.</p><br/><p>Previewing content is important before a public release.</p><br/><p>The three idiots were planning to stay for two weeks, secretly gathering monster body parts.</p><br/><p>They are using it to fulfill a subjugation request, aren\u2019t they? But are they allowed to cheat like that?</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s not really my problem, but I\u2019ll have them buy my silence by guiding me to a human city.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd so, you\u2019re showing the way.\u300d</p><br/><p>I said in response to their troubled expressions,</p><br/><p>\u300cWe understand, danna!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe shall lead the way! Should we also stop by the royal capital on the way?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI know how to get around the back alleys, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>They accepted.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll leave it to them.</p><br/><p>I decided to leave in two days.</p><br/><p>When I had gone to notify Rigurdo of the fact, I found out that he had already prepared the bags for departure. How diligent.</p><br/><p>And after using the magic circle to get to the cave, I had Gabil show me to our medium grade medicine stash.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Rimuru-sama! We have been waiting!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy, Rimuru-dono! I am ecstatic that you let me work in such a wonderful environment!\u300d</p><br/><p>While on our way there we ran into Bester\u2019s laboratory.</p><br/><p>Unlike Kaijin who has to supervise lots of people, Bester can devote himself wholeheartedly to research.</p><br/><p>So this must feel like heaven to him.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are eating properly, right? Not forgetting to sleep?\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked, worried.</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. While the meals are not very diverse, they are very delicious.</p><br/><p>So I never miss a meal.</p><br/><p>As for sleep: I am frugal with it, but had a bed prepared here.</p><br/><p>Besides, it\u2019s good for your body not to sleep for a while!\u300d</p><br/><p>No it\u2019s not\u2026</p><br/><p>I thought, but he\u2019s doing what he really likes. So I decided to leave him with a \u201cdon\u2019t over do it\u201d line.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh by the way, between Kurobee copying them and being produced here, which is more efficient?\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked,</p><br/><p>\u300cWe are getting faster here.</p><br/><p>Once we get more workers and proper equipment, we\u2019ll be able to continue production without relying on Kurobee-dono.\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what he said.</p><br/><p>Since it takes some time to grow Hipokte grass, we don\u2019t need production speed to increase too much.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, should I have five people or so come as lab members?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm\u2026 I need to teach them the basics too, so I\u2019d like about ten.</p><br/><p>Since I want to be rearing successors as well, you see.\u300d</p><br/><p>Current production speed is three hours to dilute one pill. Kurobee can manage the same in a single hour.</p><br/><p>I can make one immediately, but I refrain from doing so. They need to be able to make it without my involvement.</p><br/><p>Thus, they\u2019ll be able to manage without me in emergency situations.</p><br/><p>However, they do currently focus on diluting my restorative pills to create twenty medium grade pills. Doing so, using \u3008Membrane Creation\u3009, is Bester\u2019s job.</p><br/><p>Along that would be very difficult, so he has Gabil\u2019s men help him. After evolving into Dragonewts they learned to use some simple magic, it seems.</p><br/><p>If three people other than Bester learn to use it, the speed triples.</p><br/><p>Working on a single pill every hour. In other words, they\u2019ll be able to create twenty medium grade ones. So in a single 8 hour working day, they\u2019ll add 160 pills to our stock.</p><br/><p>An excellent production line we\u2019ve made here.</p><br/><p>If they fail at growing more, they\u2019ll be stuck with other chores while Bester will continue his research. Which makes sense.</p><br/><p>Approving of their plans, I left to let Rigurdo know.</p><br/><p>Until now Bester has been working without sleep, producing more than eighty pieces a day.</p><br/><p>Probably preparing the city for the future. Taking 500 pieces from our stash, I deposited them into my stomach.</p><br/><p>These I plan to sell in human city and purchase some magic stones.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll figure out the price with Kaijin later.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, continue as you have. As for Bester-dono, please do not overexert yourself!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease leave it to me! I will work myself to the bone for you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll leave the matter about ten people to you!\u300d</p><br/><p>They saw me off.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, I went to see Kaijin to decide the lowest price we\u2019d sell these at.</p><br/><p>Low quality medicine is called potions here and sells for about 3 silver coins a piece.</p><br/><p>Which is actually pretty high. It\u2019s not hard to imagine one\u2019s earnings for the day being spent on medicine.</p><br/><p>However, this medicine can treat 20% of most injuries and even grave ones.</p><br/><p>In comparison, restorative magic such as\u3008Heal\u3009will only restore 10% of injuries and hard to use in emergency situations.</p><br/><p>So our medicine is twice as effective. High grade medicine can restore 50%, but I digress. What should we set the price at?</p><br/><p>\u300cListen, danna. Don\u2019t set the price twice as high. Sell no lower than 15 silver coins a piece.</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t something a beginner would buy. It\u2019s meant for B rank and above adventurers.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s alright to raise the price even more! Aim to sell at about 20 silvers.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaijin fervently explained.</p><br/><p>As he says. This medicine is very useful, so we\u2019d be in trouble if we set the price too low and get too large of an order.</p><br/><p>If we don\u2019t make a profit we can\u2019t buy magic stones. So aiming for 20 silvers a piece is smart.</p><br/><p>Perhaps I should also sell one or two of my personal pills.</p><br/><p>After I acknowledged his words, we ended the meeting.</p><br/><p>And thus finished our preparations.</p><br/><p>The next day, I met up with the three idiots.</p><br/><p>After finishing their preparations, the trio was waiting for me.</p><br/><p>If we take the highway we\u2019ll run straight into Farmas Kingdom. The Count\u2019s domain that Youmu has spoken so much about.</p><br/><p>And that would mean meeting the greedy count, so no thanks.</p><br/><p>So, we\u2019ll be walking through the forest.</p><br/><p>We are aiming for the small country Brumund.</p><br/><p>To meet with Freedom Association\u2019s guild master and decide on a course of action.</p><br/><p>A year has passed since I was reincarnated into this world.</p><br/><p>And I am finally heading towards a human city.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Maybe I\u2019m just being too greedy.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I was thinking while munching on some delicious (or not?) weeds and stones.</p><br/><p>Since I can spit out water, can\u2019t I use it as a water cannon type of thing?</p><br/><p>Yeah, you don\u2019t have to say it.</p><br/><p>You think I\u2019m going to fail, don\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t I ridiculed enough?</p><br/><p>I mean, at times of need I can do what needs to be done.</p><br/><p>Even my report card read \u201cIf he tries he can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>And so\u2013I can do this!</p><br/><p>With that thought, I quickly hurried to the lake.</p><br/><p>As I had imagined while enshrouded in darkness, the underground lake it pretty damn big.</p><br/><p>But surpassing my imagination, the lake had a mysterious and tranquil atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Lacking any presence of life, it was completely serene.</p><br/><p>Although the magical energy permeates the water, I dare say that no living thing inhabits it.</p><br/><p>An example of uncorrupted nature!</p><br/><p>What a beautiful sight!</p><br/><p>That being that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Cause I didn\u2019t practice last time, I still suck at shooting water with full strength.</p><br/><p>When the \u201cmouth\u201d is this large, the jet propulsion strength is far too high.</p><br/><p>This time, while imagining a water pistol, I tried releasing just a bit.</p><br/><p>As if filling my mouth with water and spitting just little out.</p><br/><p>But no water is coming out.</p><br/><p>Is it too small, now?</p><br/><p>After increasing it just a bit, it did come out. And with good force.</p><br/><p>I tried soaking the nearby boulder.</p><br/><p>Alright, good.</p><br/><p>Next, let\u2019s widen the opening for combat use.</p><br/><p>\u30fb</p><br/><p>\u30fb</p><br/><p>\u30fb</p><br/><p>With the boulder as my target, I gently began practicing while increasing output.</p><br/><p>Okay. I kind of got the hang of this.</p><br/><p>But, although if this hit someone it will hurt, I certainly can\u2019t call this a finisher.</p><br/><p>How should I\u2026?</p><br/><p>While worrying over this question, I entered the lake.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s, at most, like a bath to relax when tired.</p><br/><p>No\u2026 I\u2019m not just playing in the water!</p><br/><p>I observed my body floating and sinking with [Magic Perception].</p><br/><p>Just like a jellyfish\u2026</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026 if I were to make my \u201cface\u201d oscillate, could I create a water current?</p><br/><p>After I reached out to the magic energy in my face, I tried making it oscillate.</p><br/><p>With a *pyoon pyoon\u2026 pyooooooon*, I felt small ripples being formed. And, I began moving through the water. A great success!!!</p><br/><p>Bemused, I played around in the water.</p><br/><p>What a nice change of pace!</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cSkill [Water Current Control] has been acquired\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>For a second I thought it was [Great Sage], but seems to be the \u201cVoice of the World\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>To have gained a skill while playing.</p><br/><p>In the end I was able to control depth, direction, and speed.</p><br/><p>And if I have to, I can just accelerate with [Hydraulic Propulsion].</p><br/><p>If you consider the fact that I don\u2019t need to breathe, it might actually be pretty easy to fight in the water.</p><br/><p>To say nothing of running away.</p><br/><p>Is what I thought as I got out of the lake.</p><br/><p>The break\u2019s over.</p><br/><p>The means of attacking is the problem.</p><br/><p>And through having taken this break, I got a new idea I wanted to try.</p><br/><p>I needed to increase the compression of water in the water gun.</p><br/><p>This time, I imagined loading a bit of water into a cylinder and shooting it out.</p><br/><p>By calibrating the aperture and the pressure, I could calibrate the power of the shot\u2013the same principle as the [Water Current Control].</p><br/><p>*Bishuu!!!*</p><br/><p>Flying out sharply, the water hit the targeted boulder.</p><br/><p>It left a small mark.</p><br/><p>Success\u2026. right?</p><br/><p>As to not forget that feeling, I decided to continue practicing.</p><br/><p>While regulating the aperture and pressure, of course.</p><br/><p>Then, I tried to imagine imagine the water rotating.</p><br/><p>And rather than the size of the opening, I tried to thin the shape of the water.</p><br/><p>Yes! The idea was \u201cCutting water!\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bishun!*</p><br/><p>The water blade cut the boulder!!!</p><br/><p>Honestly, even I was surprised at its power.</p><br/><p>A week\u2019s worth of practice (lol), had finally bore fruit!</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cSkill [Water Blade] has been acquired\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cThe skills [Hydraulic Propulsion], [Water Current Control], and [Water Blade] have evolved into Extra Skill [Water Manipulation]\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>What do you know!</p><br/><p>It really bore fruit.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a big difference in ability and strength between extra skills and normal ones.</p><br/><p>Thus, I\u2019ve found a way to fight.</p><br/><p>And with this, I am ready to set out on a journey.</p><br/><p>At last.</p><br/><p>Since I found myself reincarnated by this underground lake, 120 days have passed.</p><br/><p>Finally, the journey away from home begins.</p><br/><p>I am uneasy.

The greater power had crushed the weaker. That was all.</p><br/><p>Indeed, he had not used any magic, but it wasn\u2019t because he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>He could have used it if he wanted, but he had no need for magic.</p><br/><p>Not only that, but Diablo was also careful about how he destroyed the golems.</p><br/><p>He thought that Rimuru would be very happy if he could make a gift of the golems to him.</p><br/><p>And so he was careful to destroy them in a way that at the end, he would be able to take the parts and reconstruct a few that were perfectly whole.</p><br/><p>For Diablo, the Destroyers that Godama was so proud of had no more value than a toy.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026it can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo\u2019s complete lack of conventionality was causing Godama to doubt everything that he had ever believed in.</p><br/><p>Fearfully, he bent down and looked over the edge into the hole. There, as Diablo had said, was the broken Destroyers.</p><br/><p>Finally, Godama started to regain his calm.</p><br/><p>But that also meant fear.</p><br/><p>Before he knew it, Diablo had sat down in his chair and was relaxing in a graceful pose.</p><br/><p>Godama realized that Diablo was looking right at him, and his face turned pale.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that Godama finally realized what kind of person he was up against.</p><br/><p>One of Great Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s 12 Guardians.</p><br/><p>They were demons with great power. And among them, Diablo was considered the head and the strongest of them all.</p><br/><p>Someone that no one should ever touch\u2013It was only now that Godama realized this.</p><br/><p>(This is bad, bad-bad-bad-bad, bad!!)</p><br/><p>His calm quickly left him again.</p><br/><p>He was now ruled by fear and confusion.</p><br/><p>(So that\u2019s why those Accommodationist scum and the Moderates had said that the use of force was to be avoided at all cost\u2026)</p><br/><p>The Humanity Emancipation Alliance was an organization of people who were concerned about the future of humanity.</p><br/><p>Not all of their members had the same ideas or principles, but they all believed that it was wrong for humans to be ruled by demons.</p><br/><p>Among them, the Moderates were the great majority, and they had the largest voice.</p><br/><p>Their argument was this, \u2018direct hostilities towards the demon lords was to be forbidden and they would send their own people to various fields in order to widen their influence.\u2019</p><br/><p>As long as they were all human, it was only natural that their opinions would differ, but Godama could not forgive them.</p><br/><p>He believed that the will of humans should be united, and that they should move to destroy the demon lords.</p><br/><p>As for the Accommodationists who wanted coexistence with the demon lords, they weren\u2019t even worth discussing. Both of these sides were nothing but groups of cowards to Godama.</p><br/><p>And so Godama had always laughed in the shadows as the Accommodationists and the Moderates talked about the danger that the demons lords could pose\u2026</p><br/><p>(But it was I who was the fool\u2026)</p><br/><p>While Godama now knew the truth, it was too late.</p><br/><p>Much too late.</p><br/><p>The energy numbers that he had been so confident about meant nothing to the demon that was in front of him.</p><br/><p>Because the person in front of him was so powerful that no numbers could be used to measure his strength.</p><br/><p>The truth was that he had antagonised this incredibly dangerous person. And it was impossible to take it back.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor-forgive me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He knelt before Diablo and begged as if praying.</p><br/><p>Diablo\u2019s smile did not move as he stared at Godama.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I was a fool. Please, have mercy\u2026 Please spare my life\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes and nose were running as he pleaded with Diablo.</p><br/><p>And then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe. Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t intend on taking your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo answered with a kind expression.</p><br/><p>Godama shouted in his heart.</p><br/><p>(Yes! He is not as cold as they say he is!)</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website. Stop reading at pirate sites that steals translations.

Yes, you will not be killed. Lord Rimuru does not like it when humans are harmed, and Souei scolded me about it. But more than anything, I still have some things I would like to hear from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo said. His expression suggested that he was truly enjoying this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. So I cannot use magic in this room, was it? Then let me test it to see if that is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>He muttered, and then a chill ran up Godama\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>He had a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>As this room was connected to the Absolute Magic Space, it was impossible to use magic behind the door. Or at least, that was supposed to be the case.</p><br/><p>However, a magic circle now appeared in front of Diablo. The shadowy light was proof that magic was activating.</p><br/><p>\u201cHo-how is this!? Magic within an Absolute Magic Space!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godama had been shocked so many times today that his brain felt like it was about to explode.</p><br/><p>This reality was not possible, and yet it was occurring right in front of him.</p><br/><p>No\u2013he realized that for this demon called Diablo, this was normal.</p><br/><p>(So this is the kind of person I have provoked\u2026)</p><br/><p>Even considering it from his position as the first of the magic researchers, Diablo was completely abnormal.</p><br/><p>And just as Godama became fully immersed in his regret, Diablo\u2019s magic was completed.</p><br/><p>And that magic was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery basic magic. Demon Bug Summoning. I summoned the bugs that live in the demon world. Aren\u2019t they cute?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bugs crawled on Diablo\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>They had many legs and resembled centipedes as they began to cover Diablo\u2019s right hand.</p><br/><p>Godama felt his heart begin to beat wildly as he watched.</p><br/><p>His breathing became rough and the sound of his heartbeat seemed like it would destroy his eardrums.</p><br/><p>(He, Diablo, what is he going to do with those\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, have you ever heard of treants?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godama\u2019s question was ignored.</p><br/><p>Of course, Godama did know what treants were.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>They were a type of monster that looked like trees and were intelligent.</p><br/><p>Godama wondered what Diablo meant by talking about them. Diablo continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you know. This demon bug is called Majuju, you see, and it has the ability to turn its host into a plant. Of course, this includes animals, monsters, demons and even humans. It can deal with any living thing, so do not worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Godama felt as if he had been thrown into a deep pit of despair.</p><br/><p>He had figured out what Diablo intended to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you can\u2019t! You don\u2019t mean to\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Majuju was a fearful demon bug.</p><br/><p>It was a bug from the demon world that made monsters and even demons its food.</p><br/><p>There was no way for a human like Godama to resist it.</p><br/><p>Godama felt fear deep within his heart.</p><br/><p>The drawing room was filled with a very unique odor.</p><br/><p>The hot vapors that rose from his groin were accompanied by something more solid that dripped behind him. Godama let out a sob.</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive me! No-no! Anything but that!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He begged with desperation, but Diablo\u2019s smile remained the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, here is your new host.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then he unleashed the demon bugs on Godama with a look of pleasure.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

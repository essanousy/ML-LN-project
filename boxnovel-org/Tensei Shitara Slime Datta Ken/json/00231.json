What is going on here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino yelled.</p><br/><p>And the reply to that was,</p><br/><p>[Umm, for the time being, the fight is on hold. If you want to continue the fight, let\u2019s meet again later!]</p><br/><p>An ambiguous reply.</p><br/><p>(I see, that Zero completed the labyrinth encroachment so those guys are in a hurry to escape.</p><br/><p>Alright, nice, I am also probably saved with this.)</p><br/><p>Judging that he was able to escape from the danger, Dino chuckled.</p><br/><p>But that was a very naive thought.</p><br/><p>Having assimilated with the labyrinth, just as Rimuru and the others predicted, Zero had completely lost his reasoning power.</p><br/><p>At the end, his sense of self was just cultivated through printing.</p><br/><p>In front of great power, he couldn\u2019t resist and became an existence which only acts on instinct.</p><br/><p>However, that was also according to what Velda had predicted.</p><br/><p>Zero will absorb the surroundings energy, multiply and enlarge.</p><br/><p>And then, he will bring destruction upon that area.</p><br/><p>That was exactly the way to operate the completed Aji Dahaka.</p><br/><p>Even a strong being like Zero is nothing but an activation medium for it.</p><br/><p>The stronger the medium is, the stronger Aji Dahaka\u2019s rampaging state will be.</p><br/><p>Not to mention that the labyrinth\u2019s insides make replenishment of vast energy extremely easy.</p><br/><p>The evil dragon which was born, sublimed all the energy it had absorbed at once and turned into an existence which can even be called the 6th dragon species.</p><br/><p>And, abiding by its evil dragon-like instincts, it began the elimination of all life forms inside the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Its name is\u2013\u201dMad Evil Dragon\u201d Zero.</p><br/><p>Malice bared its fangs.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>The trembling inside the labyrinth started growing .</p><br/><p>The reason behind it was because the source of the vibration was closing in on the floor Dino and the others were on.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, is it just me, or do you also have a bad feeling about this\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence. I also do, Pico\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>Gracia and Pico conversed anxiously.</p><br/><p>And towards those two,</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, you two, that is fine, just help me get my legs loose!</p><br/><p>Beretta, that bastard, she left, leaving the floor all metal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yelled Dino, struggling to get his legs out of the metal floor.</p><br/><p>It was probably not fun for him, being completely forgotten like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha, sorry, sorry. But, I am surprised such an unpleasant ability exists.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t you apotheosize and turn yourself into energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. This stupid annoying ability also has jamming waves flowing through it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat demon doll like one, she seemed much stronger than the ones we fought, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being trapped by physical things\u2013such a disgrace for a spiritual life form, huh, Dino?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShaddap. Just help me already, Pico.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got what you deserved, Dino. It\u2019s because you\u2019re always so lazy that you have to go through these.</p><br/><p>If you had gone all out, you might have been able to avoid this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder? I was pretty serious. At the very least, I endured the pain seriously!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pico and Gracia looked at him as if they were looking at an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you had the time to be serious about the pain, why not be serious about escaping from it?\u2019\u2013was what could be clearly read from their expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what is it, ganging up on me like that? Even I was thin\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Dino was about to say something, \u2018that\u2019 had reached their floor.</p><br/><p>That being Zero, who had lost all sense of ally and foe due to an extreme feeling of hunger.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaa\u2026 how do I say this, that Zero, seems like a different guy\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr rather, that, is it really Zero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad, he seems to have lost all senses. Aren\u2019t we in danger, as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three were dumbfounded but it was Gracia who realized the danger first.</p><br/><p>And the bad feeling they were getting a while ago was indeed appropriate.</p><br/><p>Just as their eyes met, Mad Evil Dragon Zero came attacking the three.</p><br/><p>Pico and Gracia were saving their energy for their escape.</p><br/><p>Gracia came forward and blocked Zero\u2019s tentacle attack.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Circle Shield\u2019 Gracia had equipped on her left hand had transformed into a \u2018Huge Shield\u2019 unfitting of her slender body, and she kept on blocking the lance like tentacles one after another.</p><br/><p>Its shape had resembled Gerudo\u2019s Huge Shield a lot and the abilities were also equal in general.</p><br/><p>Gracia was originally a warrior specialized in defense.</p><br/><p>However, Zero\u2013Mad Evil Dragon Zero, who had now assimilated with the labyrinth, had tentacles in all directions, making it possible for him to attack in all directions, as well.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to block them all off with just one shield and as such, Gracia\u2019s situation did not look good.</p><br/><p>Protected by Gracia, Pico created several spears to negate the tentacles.</p><br/><p>But even that attack didn\u2019t have much of an effect in front of the unlimited tentacles.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way they could match up to the Mad Evil Dragon Zero, who possessed the amount of energy the dragons did.</p><br/><p>Pico and Gracia\u2019s energy were shaved off very fast and that, on the other hand, increased Mad Evil Dragon Zero\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad! At this rate, we will run out of energy and be eaten alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do? Even with my defense, we won\u2019t last long with this in front of us.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a limit to how many shields I can create, you know?!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment, the two of them were protecting themselves but as long as the fundamental problem of not being able to defeat Zero persisted, they would just be prolonging their death.</p><br/><p>On top of that, there wasn\u2019t much time to think.</p><br/><p>Mad Evil Dragon Zero could absorb the labyrinth\u2019s energy but Pico and Gracia had no choice but to release energy.</p><br/><p>(What do we do? At this rate, we will get annihilated. But, then Velda-sama will\u2013)</p><br/><p>Dino was troubled.</p><br/><p>\u2013Dino, think carefully. Veldanava and Velda are different beings, you know?\u2013</p><br/><p>Remembering Ramiris\u2019 words, he strengthened his resolve.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s right, that\u2019s exactly it. Why was I hesitating over something like this?</p><br/><p>Why was I trying to release Dagrule, to make him fall into depravity?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it all to get over Veldanava-sama\u2019s death?</p><br/><p>It is true that he still possesses his memories but his personality\u2013even the way he thinks is like that of a completely different person\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s weird when I think about it. Is it possible that he also controlled my thoughts?</p><br/><p>Either way, taking care of Zero comes first now!)</p><br/><p>Dino tightened his fists and punched his cheeks with all his strength.</p><br/><p>There was no pain. However, he could feel quite the damage to his brain.</p><br/><p>But with that punch, all the cloudy troubles inside Dino got blown away.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, you guys! I have decided to rise against that Velda bastard!</p><br/><p>But what will you guys do? Will you\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh, geez! Who cares about such trivial stuff, just save us you good-for-nothing!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Dino. If you don\u2019t hurry, my shield will be penetrated, you know?</p><br/><p>I have been creating defensive shields continuously for a while now but all of them are being destroyed.</p><br/><p>With my strength, even buying time will be\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides, Dino, I don\u2019t think this world is such a bad place.</p><br/><p>The fried squid I had when we sneaked into this country was pretty delicious too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard it had demon ingredients mixed in but it was pretty good, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, I actually didn\u2019t really want this war.</p><br/><p>I just came along \u2018cause you said you would follow Velda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Dino. We follow you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino couldn\u2019t hide his honest surprise to Pico and Gracia\u2019s reactions.</p><br/><p>He was perplexed by how they didn\u2019t have any loyalty towards Velda, who was equivalent to even God.</p><br/><p>However, at the same time, he thought that, as he suspected, he was probably under Velda\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, got it. Seems like I made you guys wait a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino said with a smile of no doubt.</p><br/><p>And while smiling, \u2018And so, Pico, do something about this metal holding my feet!\u2019 he asked Pico refreshingly\u2013but don\u2019t tell anybody about this.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Dino came forward with a daring smile.</p><br/><p>He had Pico destroy the ground and was successful in escaping.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, then. I guess I will go all out for once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Muttered Dino, who normally looked very sleepy but now had his eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine armament manifestation!\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time in a long while, Dino apotheosized and turned his body into battle form.</p><br/><p>His appearance was blazing with splendor, with 6 pairs of wings. Shining black and white wings.</p><br/><p>He had attired himself with a jet black pastor-like formal clothing and summoned 2 swords.</p><br/><p>Excalibur and Caliburn.</p><br/><p>On top of it being a God level weapon, it was also tempered thoroughly with \u2018Star Heart\u2019.</p><br/><p>White and black, holy sword and demon sword.</p><br/><p>Excalibur, which shone like gold, and Caliburn, with a jet black body and star mount.</p><br/><p>Maneuvering those two extreme opposite swords skillfully with both hands, that was Dino\u2019s way of fighting. He was a dual-wielding swordsman.</p><br/><p>Using the Gods\u2019 greatsword Crumbling Fang was only his temporary fighting style and it was also how Ramiris knew Dino wasn\u2019t serious.</p><br/><p>As Dino had not trained using a greatsword with both hands, he was only relying on his Ultimate Skill: Belphegor\u2019s Hyper Mode to fight.</p><br/><p>If Dino had brought out his two swords, his skill would even excel that of Albert or Grasword.</p><br/><p>The strongest swordsman in this world, that was Dino.</p><br/><p>Dino casually walked forward and lined up with Gracia, who was blocking the tentacles.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the rest to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>And just as he said that, he cut off all the tentacles in an instant.</p><br/><p>Gracia took a breather.</p><br/><p>It had been more than a thousand years since she saw Dino in this form but, as always, it gave her that sense of security.</p><br/><p>(Good grief\u2026 you\u2019re so lazy\u2026)</p><br/><p>On contrary to her thoughts, Gracia had a smile on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Dino! Send that monster flying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pico cheered for Dino.</p><br/><p>Dino responded to her cheers by slightly shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p>And, at that moment.</p><br/><p>-Clang, clang-</p><br/><p>Metallic footsteps could be heard.</p><br/><p>Someone was walking towards them calmly.</p><br/><p>And then, that person asked Dino,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that your true form?</p><br/><p>Even the seal of \u2018Death Butterfly\u2019 I carved on you disappeared, eh?</p><br/><p>It stands to reason. As I thought, my eyes hadn\u2019t misjudged.</p><br/><p>So? Are you ready to apologize to Ramiris-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who came, Zegion, asked, without even showing any sign of surprise towards Dino\u2019s transformation.</p><br/><p>He probably guessed as much when he couldn\u2019t completely control Dino.</p><br/><p>That Dino\u2019s true power rivals that of Zegion\u2013or perhaps even exceeds him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, sorry about that, Ramiris.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino honestly apologized to Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Ramiris\u2019 reaction towards that\u2013</p><br/><p>[Hoooohhohohohoh! Seems like my righteousness has been proved, huh!</p><br/><p>Fine, I will forgive you! And so, Dino\u2013</p><br/><p>Defeat that Evil \u2018Dragon species\u2019 already!]</p><br/><p>Was as such.</p><br/><p>Dino gave a bitter smile and then his expression stiffened.</p><br/><p>He noticed how Ramiris mentioned \u2018Dragon species\u2019 there.</p><br/><p>(Good grief, Zero, that bastard\u2026 So he took in the labyrinth and evolved into a dragon, eh?</p><br/><p>No\u2013That\u2019s exactly what Velda aimed for, giving him Aji Dahaka.</p><br/><p>If so, I can\u2019t think of anything other than him trying to use and destroy his subordinates.</p><br/><p>Certainly\u2013such a guy can not possibly be Veldanava-sama\u2019s reincarnation.)</p><br/><p>Dino stood, without any doubt in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, will you help me out, Zegion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zegion\u2019s unhesitant reply, Dino smiled.</p><br/><p>Dino casually threw his sword to Zegion.</p><br/><p>That was Dino\u2019s favourite temporary weapon, Gods grade Crumbling Fang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will let ya have that. I need to defeat this guy quick and pay my debts to Velda.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zegion lightly nodded and said \u2018I shall accept\u2019 and caught the sword with one hand.</p><br/><p>He then went and sheathed the sword on his back.</p><br/><p>And at that moment, the Crumbling Fang started shining dazzlingly.</p><br/><p>By the time that light settled down, a pair of wings had grown on Zegion\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>That was the Crumbling Fang\u2019s newborn appearance after having combined with Zegion.</p><br/><p>It was the moment Zegion\u2019s new ability, \u2018Crumbling Feather\u2019 was born.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.It accepted you as it\u2019s master quite easily.</p><br/><p>Looks like I wasn\u2019t accepted by it till the end, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino grumbled.</p><br/><p>Zegion didn\u2019t pay any heed to Dino and turned to face Pico and handed over the thing he was holding in his other hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyuiii\u2013!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the mini dragon Gaia.</p><br/><p>Before Zegion went to defeat Zero, he searched the labyrinth and took Gaia under him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis dragon is Demon Lord Rimuru-sama\u2019s pet. Treat with utmost sincerity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, ah? Wait?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pico became flustered.</p><br/><p>She lamented \u2018why me?!\u2019 but it was quite an appropriate role.</p><br/><p>As long as Gracia focuses solely on defense, there\u2019s no one else free.</p><br/><p>Even while doing all these, the tentacle attacks didn\u2019t pause for a moment.</p><br/><p>Dino brushed it all aside.</p><br/><p>And then, the preparations of the ones left behind in the labyrinth was complete.</p><br/><p>Dino and Zegion.</p><br/><p>Next, it was their turn to attack.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

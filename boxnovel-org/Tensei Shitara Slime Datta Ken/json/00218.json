However, Veldora was the same.</p><br/><p>Veldora could circulate his own energy and naturally generate lightning.</p><br/><p>So, both of them have high lightning resistance. Hence, using lighting strike against each other was insignificant.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t effective, both of them converted their fighting aura into lightning and fired it against each other.</p><br/><p>The result, energy with different natures colliding with each other became a pillar of lighting which flooded the surrounding area.</p><br/><p>Dagruel freely manipulated the vibration wave.</p><br/><p>If the earth was vibrated, earthquake occurred, if the atmosphere was vibrated, electrical discharge was generated. It was easy to create a vacuum wave when he manipulated the airflow intentionally.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t affect Veldora.</p><br/><p>That was a justified matter. After all, Veldora is the incarnation of storm.</p><br/><p>Dagruel was well informed about that, there was no need for him to be flustered.</p><br/><p>Because both of them were longtime opponents, each of them knew well each other\u2019s character.</p><br/><p>However, as his limitation was released and became Trinity, this is the first time Dagruel fought with his original form which was the \u2018Battle Form\u2019.</p><br/><p>Dagruel was aware that his blood was boiling with excitement.</p><br/><p>Now was the time where he\u2019d have a showdown with Veldora who was his longtime fated opponent.</p><br/><p>Therefore\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cFuhahahahaha! As I expected from you, Veldora.</p><br/><p>But, I released my true power, I\u2019d be different from before!\u300d</p><br/><p>So Dagruel shouted.</p><br/><p>Becoming an Ashura, his blind spot has disappeared.</p><br/><p>Just like before, magic didn\u2019t affect him.</p><br/><p>And\u2015\u2015with\u300eHardening Power\u300f, his body easily surpassed the hardness of diamond, any kind of attacks would be repelled.</p><br/><p>For example, even if Dagruel was attacked by a master with the same level as Grasword with a god class weapon, it probably wouldn\u2019t affect him.</p><br/><p>To that extent, as the current Dagruel specialized in defensive power.</p><br/><p>Invincibility. That was Dagruel\u2019s current state.</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahahaha! Laughable!\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora laughed down Dagruel\u2019s shout.</p><br/><p>And then, he threw Thunderstorm (Lightning Storm Roar) as it was.</p><br/><p>The compressed mass of atmosphere draws near Dagruel while releasing electrical discharge.</p><br/><p>However, that super-density attack was grabbed by Dagruel with one hand and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s useless, Veldora. Didn\u2019t I say that such superficial techniques like this would not affect me.\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora didn\u2019t heed him.</p><br/><p>Faster than his main body which shot the Thunderstorm, Veldora\u2019s clone went behind Dagruel\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe real thing is this! Taste this, Dragon Claw!\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s fist, which was thrown at super high speed, was small, unlike the dragon\u2019s large body.</p><br/><p>However, the ominous claws that grew on his six fingers possessed\u300eSundering Power\u300fwhich could tear apart any kind of material in this world.</p><br/><p>Dagurel\u2019s\u300eHardening Power\u300fand Veldora\u2019s\u300eSundering Power\u300fcollided, resulting in sounds as if the world was creaking.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crash\u2019 \u2015\u2015and so, both have their arm disappeared.</p><br/><p>One of Dagruel\u2019s arms which defended against Veldora\u2019s claws disappeared, Veldora\u2019s left hand which accomplished the feat has also disappeared.</p><br/><p>It was a draw.</p><br/><p>Dagruel still have 5 arms which still intact. Also, the lost arm regenerate in a moment.</p><br/><p>The one he was fighting against, Veldora also can produce clones as many as he liked with\u300eParallel Existence\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch! As ever, what an absurd strong fellow he\u2019s\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe absurd one is you, Veldora. For the current me to be wounded\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora felt irritated as Dagruel was able to defend from his special attack, likewise Dagruel also felt annoyed as his invincible body was damaged.</p><br/><p>Still, both of them were warming up.</p><br/><p>Likely enjoying the fight, both of their attacks became more severe.</p><br/><p>A half-hearted attack would not affect both of them.</p><br/><p>They both knew about this well, but on the other hand they couldn\u2019t bring out a big technique so suddenly.</p><br/><p>Since it was not possible to expect the opponent to be careless, it was necessary to made the chance somehow.</p><br/><p>\u201cDestruction Deva\u201d and \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d, both were equal.</p><br/><p>Like \u201cKuzushi[1]\u201d in Judo, first of all, securing one's own superiority was important.</p><br/><p>It would be sheer stupidity to bring out everything in the beginning of fight.</p><br/><p>However \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Veldora completely disregarded such theory, he began attacking Dagruel at once.</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahahaha! I\u2019ll keep going! Wing Blade!\u300d</p><br/><p>Several of Veldora\u2019s clones approached Dagruel in a super high speed flight.</p><br/><p>The wings generated vibration and turned it into a high frequency blade. The vibrations of the 2 pairs of big and small wings created a death end barrier which could tear molecular bond.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s large build was covered with death end barrier and became a huge destruction sphere.</p><br/><p>Such fiendish destruction sphere was a thing that can only be created by several clones of Veldora.</p><br/><p>Everyone attacked Dagruel at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuuh!\u300d</p><br/><p>However, Dagruel didn\u2019t panic.</p><br/><p>Grasword\u2019s face turned to the front, preparing great swords on both of his hands.</p><br/><p>And then, he moved to intercept it while at the same time several of Veldora clones approaching.</p><br/><p>The speed of the great sword\u2019s edge which length exceeded 10m easily surpassed the speed of sound.</p><br/><p>By each one of Dagruel\u2019s sword flash, the destruction sphere that Veldora\u2019s clones had created was negated.</p><br/><p> In other words, that means the clones were destroyed.</p><br/><p>Dagrueal didn\u2019t slacken his attacks.</p><br/><p>He continued,</p><br/><p>\u300cExploding Chains of the Sealed Destroyer Prison!\u300d</p><br/><p>With Fenn\u2019s face facing the front, he tried to capture Veldora using Gleipnir in his hand.</p><br/><p>With his\u300eEyes of Truth\u300f, he discovered the one which have the greatest amount of energy from among the countless clones without any difficulty.</p><br/><p>No matter how many Veldora created his clones, it would be useless in front of his\u300eEyes of Truth\u300f\u2015\u2015 or should it have be\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cUnfortunately! That just my clone~!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora shouted like making fool of him.</p><br/><p>In fact, any individual that get caught by Gleipnir would immediately annihilated and disappear.</p><br/><p>Since it was so quick and overdone.</p><br/><p>\u300cOhh\u2026\u2026 you, to be able to deceive my eyes\u2026\u2026 What kind of trick did you use?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu. Oh Dagruel, even when you unleash your true power, you can\u2019t defeat me.</p><br/><p>As there\u2019s no chance for you to win!</p><br/><p>Besides, even I have grown stronger. I\u2019d be bothered if you think I\u2019m still the same as the old me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora dodged Dagruel\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Properly speaking,\u300eEyes of Truth\u300f can\u2019t be deceived.</p><br/><p>However, with his\u300eExistence Probability Fluctuation\u300f, it was possible for Veldora to shift himself with his clones momentary.</p><br/><p>It was possible by manipulating Parallel Existence and Probability Manipulation at the same time, one of his secret technique.</p><br/><p>In addition of those two, it also utilized Space Manipulation or so Rimuru (Ciel) had explained it to him about the ability, but Veldora ignored it.</p><br/><p>Even if he didn\u2019t completely understand the fine details, there was no problem because he mastered how to use it instinctively, so Veldora thought.</p><br/><p>For such reason, it was true that he can\u2019t give an explanation about it.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, in case he understood it, he would be boastfully explaining about it, it could be said that it was good that Veldora didn\u2019t really comprehend it.</p><br/><p>Adding another thing for Veldora\u2019s credit, it was not because his comprehensive ability that was lacking, it just that the theory behind it was too difficult.</p><br/><p>Even if he was able to understand and mastered it instinctively, it was not possible for him to explain it to other person with words.</p><br/><p>Because Dagruel wasn\u2019t expecting Veldora to gave him the answer, he continued his words not caring about it.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat no chance to win you said? What a nonsense you talked about\u2026\u2026 But it seems to be true that you\u2019re different from the old time.</p><br/><p>If I can\u2019t see where your main body are, then I shall erase all of your clones at the same time!\u300d</p><br/><p>While talking, he created a convenient situation for himself.</p><br/><p>It also one of fighting techniques.</p><br/><p>Even a strong person of Dagruel\u2019s caliber, wouldn\u2019t ignore such petty tricks</p><br/><p>Instead, he thought that obtaining a bit of superiority even by using such petty technique was a big matter.</p><br/><p>He calmly activated Space Grasp and the range of his interference wave expanded.</p><br/><p>After he confirmed that it wasn\u2019t Veldora\u2019s clone and he wasn\u2019t hiding using\u300eEyes of Truth\u300f, he cut out the dimension, creating an isolated space.</p><br/><p>In this space, there were only Dagruel and Veldora.</p><br/><p>Also, all of Veldora\u2019s clones, in order to eliminated them together at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u300cMuu!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI got you, Veldora. Eat this! Quasar Break[2]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>A great earthquake shook this cut out space.</p><br/><p>The inside of the space was filled with super dimensional vibration with Dagruel as its epicenter.</p><br/><p>Irreversible, interfering destructive waves were generated and emitting invisible lights. Dagruel consumed 60% of his energy to bring forth absorption light rays.</p><br/><p>Dagruel converted his own body into a pseudo-black hole, absorbing and destroying all matters inside the space.</p><br/><p>At that time, because of the generated friction which exceeding the isolation space, dazzling light begun to overflow.</p><br/><p>No matter what kind of life form, if they receive the interference of this overwhelmingly high energy concentration, it might be impossible for them to preserve their own existence.</p><br/><p>Not just disintegrated, they would be swallowed into the black hole and disappear.</p><br/><p>However, the majority of the absorbed energy was used by Dagruel to maintained his own existence. It didn\u2019t meant that Dagruel can absorb everything, so as a special attack, it can\u2019t be used continuously.</p><br/><p>Dagruel had the conviction on his special attack, and checked the result.</p><br/><p>The completely isolated space that Dagruel created closed together when he absorbed the radiated light rays.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed that some distortion remained in the dimension, even affecting the real world.</p><br/><p>It could be said as a scar of transcendental destruction\u2015\u2015 although it would assimilate with the surroundings and returned to normal once time flows.</p><br/><p>There should be no one who able to survive that attack\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cUhhhhhhhh\u2026.. tha, that just now is very dangerous you know\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Dagruel was astonished with his eyes wide opened.</p><br/><p>\u300cIm, impossible! You able to survive that!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Dagruel shouted due to the rest of the shock.</p><br/><p>It was his strongest attack that should eliminate anyone completely.</p><br/><p>For Dagruel to be surprised was normal.</p><br/><p>In the isolated space, there was no escape. Yet, for Veldora to survive after receiving the direct hit should be impossible.</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019s a fact that Veldora survived.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026Ku, Kuha, Kuahahahaha!</p><br/><p>So, something like this isn\u2019t a big deal for me!\u300d</p><br/><p>When you observe him carefully, Veldora was not unharmed.</p><br/><p>His wings were tattered, and his whole body was injured all over. He just pretended to be okay.</p><br/><p>In fact, he was not completely evading the attack just now.</p><br/><p>Making good use of Ultimate Skill\u300eChaotic Lord Nyarlathotep\u300f, Veldora thinned his existence probability to the utmost limit, and was barely able to evade the interference wave of the destructive energy. However, several of the clones failed in evasion, they were all annihilated.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a terrifying technique, and if Veldora was even a bit late, Veldora would be definitely destroyed.</p><br/><p>Veldora integrated all of his remaining clones and checked the current situation.</p><br/><p>His remaining energy currently was at 50%, he included the amount that was lost to Shion.</p><br/><p>(I consumed a lot. However, it\u2019s all according to the calculation!)</p><br/><p>Dgaruel and Veldora were almost even.</p><br/><p>Veldora had about 30% of his energy taken by Shion before the fight began.</p><br/><p>Therefore, to overturn the disadvantageous situation, it was necessary to make Dagruel wasted his.</p><br/><p>The current situation of the amount of their remaining energy are, Veldora at 50% against Dagruel with 40%. A reversal.</p><br/><p>However, it was good because he succeeded in the gamble, the probability of his survival was very small against the attack.</p><br/><p>Veldora gambled that he could evade it with Ultimate Skill\u300eChaotic Lord Nyarlathotep\u300f.</p><br/><p>Veldrora had won the gamble.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026 In the first place, even if he lose the gamble, he act with the prediction that there was no doubt that he could be regenerated by Rimuru.</p><br/><p>(If I know that it\u2019s possible for me to regenerate, I\u2019m not going to be scared of any dangerous battle! Kuahahaha!)</p><br/><p>Veldora laughed loudly with his true feelings that can\u2019t be let out.</p><br/><p>This was exactly the reason why Veldora said Dagruel had no chance to win against him.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, do you know? If you make one mistake, you could be annihilated and won\u2019t be able to regenerated!?</p><br/><p>Why you don\u2019t focus on defense? Without doing any risky gamble, if you focused yourself on defense with all of your power, you could avoided getting annihilated\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Even I didn\u2019t think that I can deliver the final blow on you who become unable to fight.</p><br/><p>Why you need to wager your life for Ruminas and humans!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHumph! That aside, Dagruel.</p><br/><p>Why do you need to obey Velda\u2019s order? That person is not my older brother!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015That maybe so.</p><br/><p>But, his aura, was without doubt, Veldanava-sama\u2019s.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s enough. I lived to serve that Person.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLaughable! For you to work hard for an impostor, you\u2019re not worthy of the reputation of Destruction God!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up, Veldora! I won\u2019t forgive you if you mocked that Person ,even if you\u2019re His younger brother.\u300d</p><br/><p>Dagruel boosted his fighting aura.</p><br/><p>Then, he turned small from his about 15m large body in a flash.</p><br/><p>Dagruel became around 3m in size. However, lightning flashed from his body, super compressed energy could be felt.</p><br/><p>\u300cMu!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFuhahahaha. It was you who taught me, Veldora.</p><br/><p>When you control your anger, further power can be gained\u2015\u2015or so\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora recalled those words.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, he had talked with Dagruel about the knowledge of the holy book (manga).</p><br/><p>Just from that bit of information, Dagruel had splendidly sublimated it to actual combat level.</p><br/><p>Compressing himself, the density of Dagruel\u2019s energy seemed to be tremendous.</p><br/><p>Size is power, but he would be at disadvantage with the way things are going. Veldora realized so.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood grief, for you to learn to control that far.</p><br/><p>As expected from Dagruel. However, I will not be defeated!\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora also compressed his energy and transformed into human form, as a respond to Dagruel.</p><br/><p>The unordinary melee fight begun.</p><br/><p>Dagruel\u2019s fist sunk into Veldoro\u2019s abdomen.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Veldora\u2019s elbow hit Dagruel\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Their fight lasts several hours, neither of them yielding to the other.</p><br/><p>A kick for a kick, a fist for a fist.</p><br/><p>Each other\u2019s attacks will be countered with the same attack.</p><br/><p>Instead of fighting firmly on the ground, the places of their battle were changing one after another.</p><br/><p>From the sky to the ground.</p><br/><p>And blowing off the surroundings, to the desert.</p><br/><p>And again to the sky high.</p><br/><p>Sometimes outside the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>For both of them who are masses of energy, the battlefield was same whether they go.</p><br/><p>With their own body as the launch pad, they driven super compressed energy to the opponent.</p><br/><p>And then, splendidly discharging the received energy out of their body, they prevented fatal injury.</p><br/><p>It was important to suppress one\u2019s own energy loss while making the opponent waste theirs.</p><br/><p>Each of their attacks intersected, properly speaking with the power of their blow, even high class Majin would be blown into oblivion.</p><br/><p>Although they were causing large damage on the surroundings, both of them already stopped caring.</p><br/><p>A fierce battle that seemed to last forever.</p><br/><p>However \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Veldora continued to wait for the opportunity.</p><br/><p>With his training with Zegion and Ultima, and guidance of the strong people in the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>In addition, his combat experience with Veldrind and Rimuru had made Veldora grew stronger by one level.</p><br/><p>Close quarters combat was the best combat technique for Veldora.</p><br/><p>\u300cI thought that I was a master, but it seem I still have a long way to go\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll say it once again, Dagruel. Stop obeying that impostor.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re so stubborn, Veldora. My loyalty won\u2019t change even if He died!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m so disappointed, Dagruel. I shall end you with my strongest secret technique!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dagruel tensed to Veldora\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>However, it was already too late. Veldora had already completed his preparation.</p><br/><p>Veldora activated his ability.</p><br/><p>That moment, the surroundings are covered with prismatic darkness[3].</p><br/><p>Engulfing a vast area that even covered the region of the death desert of Holy Kingdom Ruberios\u2019 territory.</p><br/><p>\u300cFertile Paradox!!\u300d[4]</p><br/><p>Veldora muttered in small voice.</p><br/><p>Inside the prismatic darkness, a cruel miracle manifested.</p><br/><p>[1] a Japanese term for unbalancing an opponent in the Japanese martial arts.

That one just now was considerably dangerous you know-ssu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karion let out a deep sigh while sending a sidelong glance at Gobuta who was running, trying to escape while screaming.</p><br/><p>\u2018This guy, he\u2019s clearly doing it intentionally!\u2019 so Karion thought, as Gobuta repeatedly evaded Vega\u2019s attacks at the last moment.</p><br/><p>Yes certainly, if he was late by one beat, Gobuta would be hit by the magic bullets and die. There\u2019s no doubt about it.</p><br/><p>But, that\u2019s only the case if he\u2019s hit.</p><br/><p>\u300eKarion-san, take a half step to the right, and then jump slightly-ssu!\u300f</p><br/><p>Karion receives Gobuta\u2019s instructions and followed them without hesitation.</p><br/><p>He carried it out obediently without asking questions. This action hasn\u2019t changed since the their special training with Milim.</p><br/><p>Soon after moving according to those instructions, magic bullets hit the spot he was standing before, and the ground was gouged out by the magic bullets which bombarded his feet. Thankfully, there was no effect on Karion as he moved according to Gobuta\u2019s instructions.</p><br/><p>(As I expected, this guy is really a genius)</p><br/><p>Karion cannot see it.</p><br/><p>Even the aura bullet from before came flying faster than the speed of sound. The magic bullet was much quicker after being shot, despite it needing some time to knead magic power into the aura.</p><br/><p>Evading them with sight is difficult. Karion thought not just that it might be impossible to dodge himself, but even more to give instructions to other people.</p><br/><p>If was communicated using voice, then it would be impossible. Because before someone understood the content of the instructions, they would\u2019ve received a direct hit from the attack.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Karion and Gobuta converse with\u300eTelepathy\u300fbut......</p><br/><p>How fast does someone have to think to be able to see through the enemy\u2019s attack, movement, ascertain the kind of attack being used, then predicting the timing and the location of impact.</p><br/><p>Karion was interested in how far Gobuta had forseen, as he could barely respond with super instinct ability that was beyond his imagination.</p><br/><p>He remember the conversation happened when Gobuta arrived a little while ago.</p><br/><p>\u300cKarion-san, it will be bad if you are still like that-ssu. Can\u2019t you use\u300eBeastification[1]\u300fjust for a moment and immediately cancel it-ssu?\u300d</p><br/><p>He said such a thing.</p><br/><p>Karion understood that he was in a dangerous situation as he more or less lost half of his body. However, he couldn\u2019t understand the meaning of Gobuta\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? You, what are you saying\u2026\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s easy, you know-ssu. You just need to activate\u300eBeastification\u300f and immediately tell your mind to cancel it-ssu!\u300d</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t understand the meaning, he carried it out just as Gobuta had said.</p><br/><p>Because Gobuta is his bestie, he did it and matched Gobuta\u2019s timing.</p><br/><p>And then, an unbelievable thing happened.</p><br/><p>In a moment, his ability rose tremendously and his body regenerated due to the effect of super restoration.</p><br/><p>And, he should have transformed, but \u300eBeastification\u300f didn\u2019t activated because he cancelled it.</p><br/><p>In other words, only the recovery effect was activated. With the added bonus of his energy recovering about half by taking in the surroundings\u2019 magic essence.</p><br/><p>(Haaaaaa!? What the hell is this!!)</p><br/><p>Karion was astonished.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t clearly understand what happened, but was certain he was able to recover while keeping\u300eBeastification\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cWow, as expected from Karion-san, you\u2019re able to do it in one try-ssu!</p><br/><p> In case you failed I had a Full Potion-ssu, but with potions-su your energy wouldn\u2019t restore right-ssu.</p><br/><p>How is it, convenient right? I also taught this to Gabil-san, I\u2019m overjoyed-ssu!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gobuta said those words.</p><br/><p>In other words, it\u2019s possible for people who possess transformation type abilities to receive the complete recovery effect by canceling the transformation at the right time.</p><br/><p>\u2018How can you know this without a transformation ability!!\u2019 so Karion wanted to ask Gobuta, but he needed to act rationally now and strongly endured it.</p><br/><p>Anyway, right now it\u2019s time for him to defeat Vega.</p><br/><p>(Actually, that guy looks like a bad joke\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>While Karion thought so, he kept avoiding Vega\u2019s attacks by following Gobutas\u2019 instructions.</p><br/><p>Vega felt that he had never before been made a fool by a Hobgoblin, who impudently came to support his opponent.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s so weak to the extent that it would die if I hit it with one bullet.</p><br/><p>His opponent is only a small and weak devil class with a meager amount of magic power whose barely surpass A rank.</p><br/><p>His attacks couldn\u2019t hit this opponent.</p><br/><p>(Shit! Stop messing around!!)</p><br/><p>He violently throws out the aura bullets without refining them against the ground.</p><br/><p>The aura bullets explode on the ground, blowing the earth and sand to the sky.</p><br/><p>(Humph! With this I\u2019ve deprived them of their sight. You insolent trash!!)</p><br/><p>Hidden by the raised dust, Vega molds an extra-large magic bullet. And then, against his targets who have their sight deprived from them, he releases his sure kill attack.</p><br/><p>The large magic bullet goes on while blowing away the dust.</p><br/><p>However, he notices that the presence of his targets disappeared right before the large magic bullet hit them.</p><br/><p>\uff08\u2015\u2015\uff01\uff1f\uff09</p><br/><p>Vega\u2019s question was answered by a short sword stabbing his flank.</p><br/><p>\u300cWaa! It\u2019s so tough-ssu. My hand that tried to stab him became numb-ssu!\u300d</p><br/><p>That damn impudent goblin seems to have sensed the place where magic power was refined beyond the blockage of the dust and at the same time tried to stop it.</p><br/><p>Gobuta didn\u2019t immediately utilize the smokescreen and attack. Instead, he completely suppressed his presence and slipped into Vega\u2019s bosom under the cover of the earth and sand.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t make fun of me, you lowly goblin!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Vega who\u2019s enraged, shouts so.</p><br/><p>But, Gobuta without panicking,</p><br/><p>\u300cOoh, you have mistaken-ssu. I\u2019m a Hobgoblin-ssu!\u300d</p><br/><p>So, Gobuta corrected Vega\u2019s statement in a cheerful manner.</p><br/><p>Vega\u2019s mind is boiling with anger due to Gobuta making fun of him</p><br/><p>But, that state of mind is a reaction that Gobuta expected...... Karion who had been forgotten by Vega, who can\u2019t think straight because of anger, is getting closer to Vega while suppressing his presence.</p><br/><p>Then,</p><br/><p>\u300cDie, Beast Roar!\u300d</p><br/><p>Vega who nearly attacked Gobuta at that moment received a direct hit from Karion without being able to react.</p><br/><p>Gobuta splendidly made Vega dance in his palm.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a deadly blow from the Lion King Karion, not just surface-grazing power. Half of Vega\u2019s body had been blown off by the magic particle cannon.</p><br/><p>However, even in such conditions, this isn\u2019t a serious problem for Vega.</p><br/><p>Because his auto-recovery ability activates immediately, his body simply starts regenerating.</p><br/><p>The problem was the inferior race, a hobgoblin, who was currently leading him around by the nose for no good.</p><br/><p>\u300cDamnnnnn!! I will not forgive this, you inferior insect trashhhh!!\u300d</p><br/><p>So Vega shouted.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s already wanting to smash it with all of his power.</p><br/><p>His eyes burn with anger, there\u2019s no longer any fragment of his pride to prevent him from doing things seriously, or make him underestimate weak opponents.</p><br/><p>Vega, for the first time, recognized Gobuta as his opponent.</p><br/><p>At the same time Vega recognized Gobuta as an enemy, he regained his calm train of thought.</p><br/><p>He changed his thoughts, \u2018If it was an enemy he himself recognized then he was not made a fool of, it\u2019s just a great opponent\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u300cKukkuku. Is that so? That\u2019s right. Yours truly wouldn\u2019t have much trouble against a mere goblin.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re pretending to be a goblin, but you\u2019re not actually an ordinary one, something like that right?!\u300d</p><br/><p>Vega revealed a thought that he himself agreed with, while laughing.</p><br/><p>Karion looked on with eyes that said \u2018What is this guy talking about?\u201d and ignored him, Vega then continues.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut\u2026\u2026 Yours truly doesn\u2019t have a bad eyes. Your true abilities have been seen through easily!!</p><br/><p>Well now! You should reveal your true colors quickly! Yours truly will destroy you!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying so, he pointed his finger at Gobuta.</p><br/><p>To Vega, who said such a thing,</p><br/><p>\u300cHuu, good grief-ssu. If it\u2019s been seen through then there\u2019s no other choice-ssu.</p><br/><p>Okay-ssu. I will show you-ssu! My true form!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gobuta\u2019s playing along well.</p><br/><p>And while acting like that,</p><br/><p>\u300eWell then, without any delay. Karion-san, get behind him and fire another one-ssu!\u300f</p><br/><p>Gobuta gave out the most cowardly instructions to Karion.</p><br/><p>Even so, Karion didn\u2019t have any reason to object to it.</p><br/><p>He left Gobuta, who was saying his catchphrase and for some reason taking a strange pose, to sneak around behind Vega.</p><br/><p>\u300c \u201cStar Lord\u201d Ranga, it\u2019s your turn-ssu! Activated\u300eStar Wolf Summon\u300f!!</p><br/><p>\u300eRight now-ssu!!\u300f</p><br/><p>See this carefully! \u201cTransform\u201d!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gobuta shouts, and in an instant, Ranga jumps out of the shadow.</p><br/><p>(Well well, I\u2019m tired of waiting you know, Gobuta)</p><br/><p>(Well~ it takes time to reach the climax you know-ssu!)</p><br/><p>Vega hadn\u2019t imagined such exchanges happening.</p><br/><p>Vega looked at Gobuta, with a surprised and delighted expression, as Gobuta was wrapped in light and the appearance of a huge amount of magic power was fused with him.</p><br/><p>Karion, who had done with his preparations, fired out a Beast Roar at Vega\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Alas, it has no effect on Vega even though he had already been hit by it many times. Even the holes in his body got healed in an instant.</p><br/><p>He shoots it with the maximum power, but even the 1 decimeter wide flash didn\u2019t seem to burn Vega completely.</p><br/><p>It\u2019d be the same even if he did it with Diffusion Roar.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s able to understand that the result wouldn\u2019t change, even if 9 magic particle cannons were fired at the same time, it wouldn\u2019t stop Vega from recovering.</p><br/><p>He understood it now.</p><br/><p>Vega wasn\u2019t really doing things seriously.</p><br/><p>Karion shot his technique according to Gobuta\u2019s instructions, Vega already received more than three direct hits as he was careless due to the smokescreen and his aura bullets.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, Karion\u2019s energy was about to run out. Because the timing for the skill he learnt a while ago was difficult, restoration wasn\u2019t an option, it has a low success rate so it can\u2019t be expected much.</p><br/><p>Above all,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt cannot be used many times-ssu. Because it is absorbing the magic essence from the surroundings-ssu, the concentration of the magic essence will get thinner and eventually the restoration won\u2019t happen-ssu.</p><br/><p>If someone powerful like Rimuru-sama or Veldora-san did it, who have much of their own magic power, such worry is not needed\u2026..\u300d</p><br/><p>Because of that.</p><br/><p>Karion could certainly understand that it\u2019s not a technique that could be abused.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, what\u2019s the purpose of attacking so many times while knowing that it\u2019s useless?</p><br/><p>At first even Karion questioned it, he was able to understand the purpose a bit now.</p><br/><p>Vega was looking down on them and never going seriously. With that, his weaknesses can be analyzed by attacking him from various angles and positions.</p><br/><p>And Gobuta wonderfully provoked the self-conceit Vega by showing off that weakness and taking the role as the decoy.</p><br/><p>(Splendid, As expected of Gobuta\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If we used full power from the start, then we wouldn\u2019t have been able to draw information smoothly up to now\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Karion praises Gobuta\u2019s strategy honestly.</p><br/><p>But, the result was only this dangerous feeling he got, that was, Vega didn\u2019t have a weakness.</p><br/><p>Vega had taken root in the ground and absorbed the nourishment from it.</p><br/><p>And he\u2019d take in the organic matters such as corpses and plants to made up his body. The only saving grace was how it seems he\u2019s unable to use inorganic substance for his body.</p><br/><p>The battlefield continued spreading, and so new corpses are being mass-produced on the ground.</p><br/><p>It was possible for Vega to restore his body near limitlessly.</p><br/><p>Karion bit his mouth and thought unpleasantly, as he saw that the wound he just gave to Vega was quickly restored.</p><br/><p>However, in front of Karion and Vega, the light which came from Gobuta became jet black fog that was cladding Gobuta inside it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Transform!\u2019 so Gobuta\u2019s voice reached Karion\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Then\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>What appeared was the figure that Karion had witnessed several times during their special training before.</p><br/><p>This is the combined state of Gobuta and the Black Storm Star Wolf, Ranga, in this form Gobuta has energy levels comparable to an awakened Demon Lord[2].</p><br/><p>In other words, gathering the information was done. From now on, it was the real performance.</p><br/><p>\u300eKarion-san, please move back and refine your aura-ssu!</p><br/><p>I request one big shot-ssu, on my signal!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eBut, I\u2019m already out of energy.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, I can\u2019t shoot anymore\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat are you saying! You still have\u300eDragon Body\u300fdon\u2019t you-ssu?</p><br/><p>With that, please pour all your magic power in that one shot\u2013ssu!\u300f</p><br/><p>Karion steels himself.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s his trump card, but it will not mean anything if he didn\u2019t use it.</p><br/><p>If not right now, then when will he use it?</p><br/><p>\u300eUnderstood. I will use it, but it only has a 10 minute duration, is that good?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eEhh!? Wasn\u2019t it 3 minutes before-ssu!? As expected from you-ssu!</p><br/><p>But, I intend to end this battle with a huge one.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t worry about what happens later, let\u2019s go with a bang-ssu!\u300f</p><br/><p>Gobuta, cheery to the end, said it with a carefree tone like he wasn\u2019t worried about anything at all.</p><br/><p>Karion can\u2019t help but smile wryly to Gobuta\u2019s cheerfulness, which blew away even his worries.</p><br/><p>\u300eGotcha. I\u2019ll leave it to you!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The conversation ended with Karion\u2019s reply as the last.</p><br/><p>And with Vega, who became serious, Gobuta\u2019s true battle has begun.</p><br/><p>A Vega who became serious, was strong.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuhaahhahahaha!!</p><br/><p>For yours truly to play seriously, you should feel honored!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEhhh, that\u2019s my line-ssu!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Both of them clashed.</p><br/><p>With just that, they made the surroundings\u2019 air vibrate and made explosions occur.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a clash of pure energy</p><br/><p>It was an exchange of supernatural powers beyond Karion\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>Ultimate Skill\u300eEvil Dragon Lord Azi Dahaka\u300f possessed the ability to manipulate organic matter.</p><br/><p>He constitutes his body with an aggregation of very small bacteria. Thus, he can freely regenerate himself.</p><br/><p>Even acquiring new abilities by predation thanks to imitating the structure of his prey, this he can freely use too.</p><br/><p>He was an existence that should be called an Imitation Slime (Pseudo-Artificial man-made Slime) which Yuuki created.</p><br/><p>He had taken the characteristic of various creatures and added improvements to the original, allowing him to use it efficiently.</p><br/><p>What he let out on the surface was only a small part of him which transformed into a humanoid form, while his main body stays hidden.</p><br/><p>In other words, beyond what\u2019s standing on the surface, everything is connected to the ground, so it\u2019s possible to replenish himself without limit.</p><br/><p>And, not only his detached kin whom he give a simple order like the evil dragon beasts from before, he can create several clones of himself.</p><br/><p>His clones have all of his abilities.</p><br/><p>But, because there\u2019s a limit to his ability to control a person, they have the weakness that they can\u2019t perform a complicated action even if he commanded them at the same time.</p><br/><p>Vega knew this well, so he was only using the ability to regenerate himself and stopped making evil dragon beasts which could only take simple orders.</p><br/><p>However, this usage of the ability didn\u2019t make use of the true capabilities of\u300eEvil Dragon Beast Azi Dahaka\u300f.</p><br/><p>Ultimate Skill\u300eEvil Dragon Beast Azi Dahaka\u300f</p><br/><p> \u2026Thought Acceleration, Parallel Thought, Organic Matter Control</p><br/><p> Duplication Mass Produce, Ability Absorption, Space Control, Multidimensional Barrier.</p><br/><p>Those are the full contents of this ability.</p><br/><p>A dreadful ability, with very high performance .</p><br/><p>It was an ability that could be strengthened to the utmost if someone could master it.</p><br/><p>If someone could master it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Unfortunately Vega didn\u2019t have many experiences after he was born.</p><br/><p>He grew up at a dreadful speed and his capability rose, but he didn\u2019t get to master his abilities.</p><br/><p>If he was able to master Parallel Thought, he might be able to control two or more main bodies, even if there was a restriction of standing on the surface.</p><br/><p>Such threat would be unimaginable, but that was just an assumption.</p><br/><p>In the reality, Vega couldn\u2019t master it.</p><br/><p>And so, Gobuta saw it through accurately.</p><br/><p>He used his own body as a decoy, making Vega careless, and succeed in landing several strikes on Vega.</p><br/><p>Knowing the ability of the enemy when fighting with full power; will directly connect to a life or death situation.</p><br/><p>Gobuta had been taught that he should use his trump card only after he\u2019s finished analyzing the enemy\u2019s power as much as possible.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 The combat experience of the absolute master who Gobuta respected, the Great Demon Lord Rimuru, was the proof for this.</p><br/><p>As the most senior subordinate, Gobuta always witnessed Rimuru\u2019s fights.</p><br/><p>It was carved in his heart, that what was most important, above anything else, was information.</p><br/><p>Therefore\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>With Karion\u2019s cooperation, He judged that he had gathered enough information.</p><br/><p>With Vega\u2019s characteristics, which were informed by Rimuru, and the sensation that he felt when he fought him before.</p><br/><p>The answer went out naturally as he compared and matched the details.</p><br/><p>The memory and ego seem to transferred to the main body even if the part seen on the surface was erased. His regeneration is near infinite as long as he\u2019s connected with the ground.</p><br/><p>But when the temporary main body disappears and disconnected with the ground, there was some time lag that occurred during the memory and consciousness transfer.</p><br/><p>In other words, Vega\u2019s true main body is in the ground. No, he thought that there\u2019s a possibility that Vega would not be able to transfer the memory and consciousness if he vanishes at a place separated from the ground.</p><br/><p>(What a troublesome opponent-ssu. Even so, he\u2019s not invincible-ssu!)</p><br/><p>He finished analyzing most of the enemy\u2019s abilities, Gobuta was convinced of victory.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I\u2019m going-ssu!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He spoke to encourage himself and Ranga, so Gobuta went full power combat mode.</p><br/><p>Vega admired the high fighting power of Gobuta.</p><br/><p>Much like when he guessed before that this goblin was not an ordinary one, Vega trembled with joy.</p><br/><p>Vega was defeated overwhelmingly in a contest of speed.</p><br/><p>The power is on par with him, no, it seems to surpass him slightly.</p><br/><p>But, Vega was still able to continue thanks to his marvelous recovery power.</p><br/><p>He steadily amplifies his power. If he could steal his enemies abilities, his power would rise sharply in an instant.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the stronger the enemy is, the stronger he can be.</p><br/><p>He was convinced that the Ultimate Skill\u300eEvil Dragon Lord Azi Dahaka\u300fthat he obtained was certainly the ultimate invincible ability.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuhaahahahahaha!! You\u2019re pretty good. As expected from the man recognized by yours truly!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gobuta ignored Vega\u2019s praises.</p><br/><p>(Ranga-san, be ready for it soon, please your help-ssu!)</p><br/><p>(Kukukku. Very well, I understand!)</p><br/><p>That is because it\u2019s almost over.</p><br/><p>Vega got cocky before he himself recognized the real threat, he now understood that he needed to fight seriously.</p><br/><p>And he was correct.</p><br/><p>\u300cVega-san, unfortunately-ssu, it\u2019s my victory-ssu!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs if, for a goblin, no I admit that you\u2019re strong and I can\u2019t think of you as a goblin.</p><br/><p>But, yours truly is still the strongest, you still have a long way to go\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so-ssu? Then, is it okay for those to be your last words-ssu?</p><br/><p>Oh yeah, I will correct you once again Vega-san before you die-ssu, I\u2019m a Hobgoblin you know-ssu!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015what!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Gobuta and Vega locked onto each other.</p><br/><p>Vega\u2019s bacteria began its corrosion effect attack and preyed on Gobuta, but all of it was blocked by the Demon Wind Barrier of Ranga which clad Gobuta\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The magic power of the wind has deadly corrosion and decaying effects which destroyed Vega\u2019s bacteria.</p><br/><p>Gobuta declared the end to Vega who was irritated he couldn\u2019t eat him.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, Gobuta and Vega soared up into the sky due to the wind\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>All the corpses and vegetations on the ground were rolled up to the sky.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the effect of Ranga\u2019s power which allow him to freely manipulate the atmosphere. The ground became a cleared surface due to the corrosion effect of the wind, all of the germs crawling on the ground and all of organic matter were ejected to the sky.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, you! It, it can\u2019t be, yours truly\u2019s ability is\u2015\u2015!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOhhh, seeing you panic so much, did I hit the bull\u2019s-eye-ssu?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath Heralding Wind\u201d included both \u201cStorm of Destruction\u201d and \u201cLightning of Destruction\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuoooooooo!! Damn you, stop it!!

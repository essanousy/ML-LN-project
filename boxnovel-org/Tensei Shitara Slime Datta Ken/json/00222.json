Can\u2019t you leave the matter to Masayuki-dono?\u300d</p><br/><p>Nicholas called out Hinata, but she didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Masayuki heard Nicholas\u2019 word, but he stiffened as though he was startled</p><br/><p>On Hinata\u2019s mouth, there\u2019s a small smile.</p><br/><p>It was a frightening smile, reminiscent of the former Hinata.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, there\u2019s no problem. That\u2019s right\u2026.. There\u2019s no problem. Everything was as expected.\u300d</p><br/><p>Rather than answering Nicholas, Hinata muttered instinctively to feel convinced that what she thought is correct.</p><br/><p>In fact, it\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>Hinata had believed in his guess and went along with it.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Hinata had seen everything up to this result.</p><br/><p>In a word, everything was as she expected.</p><br/><p>Even when she was tormented by Reiner, all were expected events.</p><br/><p>Actually, these days Hinata had been attacked by an intense sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><br/><p>She could see a scene from a few seconds to a few minutes ahead as if she had experienced it.</p><br/><p>She experienced the same thing several times, she was convinced that it was the experience of a bit later in the future.</p><br/><p>This time luckily\u2015\u2015 although it may not be so\u2015\u2015 she was tormented by Reiner, she had been able to see the scene where he cut her limbs and gouged out her eyes.</p><br/><p>(As expected, it\u2019s difficult to restore cut limbs; though it\u2019s not amusing if the face was wounded \u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s Hinata\u2019s thought.</p><br/><p>Her face which was clean of injury was unnatural, it\u2019s not because Reiner going easy on her, the correct answer was because Hinata had evaded all of the attacks.</p><br/><p>As for her limbs, she normally received the attacks, to the extent of her tendons was cut.</p><br/><p>She was able to do this and that because she knew the future.</p><br/><p>And so, Hinata\u2019s victory condition wasn\u2019t to survive until the truth was exposed to the people, it\u2019s for the people taking shelter in the church to not be harmed.</p><br/><p>In case she poorly resisted, the knight under Reiner\u2019s command would start attacking the church, it was one of the possible futures that she saw.</p><br/><p>(Is the cause because I\u2019m connected with Chloe\u2019s soul? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my ability after all.)</p><br/><p>With a terrifying accuracy, Hinata sees the fact.</p><br/><p>Due to a small connection with Chloe, a fragment of Chloe\u2019s ability had shown memory of the future to Hinata.</p><br/><p>However, Hinata was indifferent to such thing.</p><br/><p>The important thing is only the reality that led to the best results.</p><br/><p>As things going as Hinata planned, Reiner, the subject of scorn is in front of her.</p><br/><p>He was the man who tormented her until now, she has no sympathy at the slightest for him.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then. Did you say your name is Reiner?</p><br/><p>You wanted to fight me right. Very well, I shall fight you seriously.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata sprouts a smile full of kindness and look on Reiner</p><br/><p>However, her eyes are cold.</p><br/><p>\u300cDamn you! I\u2019ll kill you and also that Hero. I\u2019m the strongest, the result is obvious.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll slaughter everyone who knows about the matter!\u300d</p><br/><p>Reiner shouted with a mind full of madness.</p><br/><p>And then he raised his sword charging towards Hinata.</p><br/><p>Without panicking, Hinata raised her rapier.</p><br/><p>Unlike the one-sided torment a while ago, there\u2019s no need for her to hold back now.</p><br/><p>She evaded the big slash from Reiner\u2019s sword, and without hesitation, she stabbed his foot.</p><br/><p>\u300cGyaaa\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Reiner screamed.</p><br/><p>Due to the intense pain, he recovered a bit of his sense.</p><br/><p>(What, what the heck is this pain\u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>Reiner was grinding his teeth as he felt an abnormal pain.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t conceal his confusion as the skill\u300ePain Perception Blockade\u300fthat he had hadn\u2019t shown its effect.</p><br/><p>The damage was not a big deal, but there\u2019s no sign of any injury.</p><br/><p>\u300cUfufufufu. Is it painful? Raise your voice more and entertain me more!\u300d</p><br/><p>With an expression of ecstasy, Hinata moistened her lips with her bewitching tongue.</p><br/><p>Nicholas and Fritz sent a hot gaze towards current Hinata.</p><br/><p>As one would expect, it\u2019s only Leonard who grieved due to it.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Hinata-sama\u2026\u2026 Your image just improved with a lot of trouble, it\u2019s spoiled now\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Certainly, her image was spoiled, but her gesture brings forth some wild enthusiastic fans.</p><br/><p>That suited Hinata very well.</p><br/><p>Because it reminded people that the strong predate the weak.</p><br/><p>Hinata started pursuing Reiner without showing any behavior of minding the response of the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Afraid of the attack which caused him intense pain even if it just grazed him, Reiner naturally fought defensively.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou-you bastard! Enchanting the sword with magic is unfair.\u300d</p><br/><p>Reiner accuses foulmouthed.</p><br/><p>However, Hinata only showing a smile, she didn\u2019t respond to Reiner\u2019s accusation.</p><br/><p>Because it\u2019s a fact, she didn\u2019t intend to deny it. Moreover, enchanting her sword with magic was not a bad reason either.</p><br/><p>Her sword is a Unique class Magic Sword.</p><br/><p>Hinata\u2019s spiritual armaments were transferred to Chloe leaving her with nothing, even if she borrowed a mass-produced type spiritual armament before, she didn\u2019t have enough power to activate it.</p><br/><p>At that time, this rapier was sent by Rimuru.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s called Phantom Pain (Phantom Rainbow Spirit Sword).</p><br/><p>It was a sword with abilities that could be said the upgraded version of the magic sword Hinata used before.</p><br/><p>Naturally, it\u2019s possible to use it to cause the opponent to die in the seventh attack like\u300eDead End Rainbow\u300f.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s the former sword, it was to destroy the spiritual body at the seventh strike.</p><br/><p>But, the sword given by Rimuru was frighteningly able to destroy even the astral body.</p><br/><p>Originally it\u2019s a legend class weapon, but it has been readjusted so Hinata able to use it.</p><br/><p>(The one before can\u2019t be compared with the performance of this one. Even I who lose my power can use it)</p><br/><p>While slightly admiring it, Hinata was satisfied with the sword\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>And then she narrowed her eyes and sent a cruel smile towards Reiner.</p><br/><p>Right now, she already hit Reiner with five attacks.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s possible to kill him immediately in the next two attacks, but she thought it would be not interesting.</p><br/><p>And, even in such situation this sword is useful.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, let\u2019s wrap it soon. I\u2019m tired of seeing your unpleasant face.\u300d</p><br/><p>Telling Reiner so, Hinata raised her sword.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo-don\u2019t underestimate me, you female fox! Th-there\u2019s no way for me to be defeated by the likes of you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Reiner shouted with squeaky voice while he swung his sword.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ll be so kind and let you live because you\u2019re a woman\u2015\u2015 Become mincemeat! Violent Decapitating Slash Wave!\u300d</p><br/><p>The power of the high-speed rotation produced by Reiner\u2019s trained body was transmitted through the sword, the target hit by the impact would be pulverized.</p><br/><p>Surely, a person who receives it will be turned into pieces of meat, it was the strongest attack Reiner can bring out.</p><br/><p>However\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cHow na\u00efve. It\u2019s only of this level\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Reiner\u2019s attack slipped through Hinata who was sneering.</p><br/><p>It was Hinata\u2019s afterimage.</p><br/><p>Blood rose to Reiner\u2019s head as he fell to the beginner trick that Hinata used.</p><br/><p>\u300cIm-impossible!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGoodbye. Please die and taste the eternal suffering in these three minutes. Dead End Pain!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Reiner unwillingly tasted the true power of Hinata who he underestimated as a weak person.</p><br/><p>Coupled with the surprise of his strongest attack missed, he was unable to react to Hinata\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Hinata\u2019s blow accurately pierced through Reiner\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>(Only this extent! With my\u300eBody Recovery ex\u300f, I can regenerate even a heart\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>And then, I will no longer forgive this woman. I\u2019ll kill you, you female fox!)</p><br/><p>Reiner admonished himself for being careless and swore to seriously kill Hinata next time.</p><br/><p>However \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Ha? What, why the pain\u2026... ha?)</p><br/><p>Reiner tried to activate his\u300eBody Recovery ex\u300f to restore the wound he received, but the ability won\u2019t active\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Not just that skill, even the effect of the skill of the body control series such as\u300ePain Sense Blockade\u300f\u300ePhysical Condition Control\u300fhad also disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cGugiyaoooooo\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u300d</p><br/><p>Reiner was gasping and writhing in pain.</p><br/><p>For a long time, Reiner didn\u2019t feel pain due to the effect of\u300ePain Perception Blockade\u300f, but now he felt intense fear and suffering.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s one of the abilities of Hinata\u2019s weapon.</p><br/><p>\u300eDead End Pain\u300f which activate at the time of the 6th attack.</p><br/><p>After sealing off the enemy\u2019s abilities, the effect of complete destruction of the spiritual body began after three minutes.</p><br/><p>It was a frightening ability which wouldn\u2019t let the enemy fell to madness and kill them while making them feel despair and pain.</p><br/><p>The pain of their soul destroyed is not physical pain.</p><br/><p>A person who received this attack might felt the three minutes as if it\u2019s an eternity.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood night. Have a good dream.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata spoke gently like putting Reiner to sleep.</p><br/><p>And then, Hinata gazes at Reiner who writhing in agony with a satisfied feeling.</p><br/><p>(Oh well. The pain that I received, I had returned it back ten thousand times.)</p><br/><p>Satisfied, Hinata loses her interest in Reiner.</p><br/><p>The pain was not repaid back ten thousand times, but Hinata didn\u2019t really care.</p><br/><p>Anyway, the hopeless situation was averted.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s most important than anything else.</p><br/><p>Rolling on the ground, Reiner was screaming.</p><br/><p>However, no one tried to help him.</p><br/><p>The soldiers who were instigated by Reiner and the prince were also unable to determine to correct action as they try to understand the situation.</p><br/><p>With the appearance of Hero Masayuki who is the hero of the people, the public opinion had gone away from Reiner and co.</p><br/><p>The prince\u2019s confession was decisive.</p><br/><p>Being the royal family\u2019s guard is the duty of the Guard Knights, but there\u2019s no reason for them to defend a regicide.</p><br/><p>In this place, there\u2019s no one who swore their loyalty to Prince Elrick.</p><br/><p>At the same time, it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s no righteousness in their leader, Reiner.</p><br/><p>\u300cWh-what we should do now\u2026\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>The knights and soldiers were trembling.</p><br/><p>Seeing everyone currently, as the chance has arrived, Masayuki stands up.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone! Which side is correct, and which side is wrong? I think it\u2019s obvious if you look at this spectacle.</p><br/><p>If all of you are wise, all of you will know the correct answer even if I don\u2019t say it\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Please, I want you all to believe in that answer. I also want to believe in everyone!\u300d</p><br/><p>Actually, Masayuki still had hesitation.</p><br/><p>The development was too fast, he didn\u2019t catch up with the situation.</p><br/><p>However, his instinct told him that this is the biggest chance to lead the people opinion.</p><br/><p>So as not to be his own opinion, he decided to induce the people with provisional wording.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s perfect. Like this, even if I make a mistake, I won\u2019t be blamed.)</p><br/><p>Masayuki was praising himself inside his mind.</p><br/><p>\u300cOoh, Masayuki-sama is trusting us\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat have we done!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf we must to meet Masayuki-sama\u2019s expectation\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>In response to Masayuki\u2019s words, the knights threw away their sword and kneeled.</p><br/><p>Their act shows that they have no hostility against Masayuki.</p><br/><p>Seeing the knights like that, relieved mood begins to flow through the people.</p><br/><p>And then\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cHero-sama seem to have straightened out the problem\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe prince have the king\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, luckily we have Hero Masayuki-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe mastermind is the Knight Leader, Reiner.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s mean, Hinata-sama is\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, it\u2019s Masayuki-sama who see the truth and save Hinata-sama from the predicament!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected from Hero-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>In this way, naturally, Masayuki\u2019s exploits had increased</p><br/><p>It spread quickly among the people,</p><br/><p>\u300eMA~SAYUKII, MA~~SAYUKII!!\u300f</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take a long time for it to be the usual grand cheering.</p><br/><p>Masayuki raised one hand awkwardly to response the people while having stiff cheeks.</p><br/><p>He had teary eyes inside his mind.</p><br/><p>However, that was a usual occurrence too.</p><br/><p>After waiting for the place to quiet down, Hinata walked to Masayuki.</p><br/><p>And then she held out her right hand,</p><br/><p>\u300cI have been indebted to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>So, she requested a handshake from Masayuki.</p><br/><p>Masayuki felt nervous as he looked at Hinata closely due to her beauty.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of beautiful women in Tempest, but Hinata\u2019s pretty face had a different peculiar charm from them.</p><br/><p>Masayuki trying to respond Hinata\u2019s request and panicky rubbing his hands.</p><br/><p>But\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>As Masayuki was charmed by Hinata, he tripped by a pebble and like a skilled mime he fallen down on his feet.</p><br/><p>As the result\u2026...</p><br/><p>He felt a soft sensation on his right hand.</p><br/><p>And he felt hair smoothly tickling his cheek\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A sweet smell that made his mind astray stimulates his nose.</p><br/><p>(Wh-why it becomes like this\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>To the rest of the event, Masayuki can\u2019t see the reality for a moment.</p><br/><p>(Or rather, this feeling on my right hand, it\u2019s like touching a finest quality cushion, it can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>Masayuki stumbled and just like that he pushed down Hinata.</p><br/><p>Carefully, his right hand was groping Hinata\u2019s plump breast.</p><br/><p>Even to this extent, he\u2019s a lucky pervert.</p><br/><p>However, it was Masayuki who feared that the result will be frightening.</p><br/><p>When Masayuki tried to stand up and making an excuse while his face turning pale \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Huh? What just now\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Masayuki realized that something passed over his head.</p><br/><p>He felt a shock as if something passed through the back of his head.</p><br/><p>(Oh! From where did I get sniped!?)</p><br/><p>However, it was somewhat different from Masayuki\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>Masayuki realized that it was the shockwave that arrived late, not the attack.</p><br/><p>In other words, the attack passed with a little difference when Masayuki fell down.</p><br/><p>If Masayuki didn\u2019t get tripped by the pebble, his life would be gone.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch. Impossible\u2015\u2015 for you to evade my assassination!?\u300d</p><br/><p>A person appeared in front of Masayuki and co, raising his astonished voice.</p><br/><p>A man who is dressed in black priest outfit, pure white wings sprouted from his back.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s the leader of the Executioners, Arios.</p><br/><p>Masayuki was confused due to the appearance of an unfamiliar man. He\u2019s not able to catch up with the situation completely.</p><br/><p>However, Venom who was guarding Masayuki immediately responds to the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell done, as expected from Masayuki. I have been vigilant, but sorry!</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t grasp any presence of that guy at all. Masayuki, you noticed him well.\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying those words, Venom came in front of Masayuki.</p><br/><p>Without noticing that Masayuki who heard it was turning pale.</p><br/><p>In fact, Venom was always scanning for any presences while guarding Masayuki.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t mean he let down his vigilant, but he couldn\u2019t catch the enemy\u2019s presence at all. In other words, the man in front of him was a very dangerous person.</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know what your purpose it, but if you want to lay your hand on Masayuki, I\u2019ll be your opponent. It\u2019s alright, Masayuki?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Ah, yes\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki nods instinctively.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Masayuki thinks that\u2019s unreasonable for him to fight the enemy.</p><br/><p>If Venom wanted to take his place, there\u2019s no reason for him to refuse.</p><br/><p>And, to Masyuki who was still confused, he heard reliable voices.</p><br/><p>\u300cMasayuki an-chan, we also here! We will show growth here!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf Masayuki-san watching, we can be relieved too!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, please see Alice and co\u2019s efforts!\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki worried about how to reply to the children.</p><br/><p>He was wondering of letting the children to fight in this trip.</p><br/><p>(But, the children are actually stronger than me\u2026\u2026 It can\u2019t be helped right!)</p><br/><p>In the end, he decided to approve them.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, how long do you intend to groping my chest?\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki jumped back panicking at that word.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-I\u2019m sorry. It-it\u2019s not on purpose\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki can\u2019t make a good excuse, but his word is interrupted by Hinata.</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand. On the contrary, I want to thank you. That man was aiming at me right?\u300d</p><br/><p>That said, Hinata was thanking Masayuki.</p><br/><p>(Well, I didn\u2019t aim for it \u2026\u2026 I feeling relieved of what happened though\u2026..)</p><br/><p>He wanted to say that, but Masayuki felt that destruction was waiting for him if he said it, he had no choice but to kept silent.</p><br/><p>Actually, Arios\u2019 target was Hinata.</p><br/><p>The reason was one.</p><br/><p>It was because Yuuki used to be worried about Hinata before.</p><br/><p>Although she was not special existence anymore, he was still anxious.</p><br/><p>He thought he should deal with her quickly as she was not a person worthy enough for him to kill.</p><br/><p>However, as he knew Reiner and co\u2019s plan, he tried to assassinate Hinata during the gap.</p><br/><p>Velda declared that don\u2019t aim at the royal capital, he didn\u2019t want to interfere as much as possible but\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Reiner failed.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he thought that he would assassinate her in an instant and immediately withdraw.</p><br/><p>However, He failed.</p><br/><p>Masayuki\u2019s luck had thwarted the timing of Arios\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s can\u2019t be helped for things to be like this. Sadly, I\u2019ll have everyone dead!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up! I\u2019m strong, you know? We have Masayuki here too!\u300d</p><br/><p>Venom responded to Arios\u2019 statement fearlessly.</p><br/><p>And so, the fight started quietly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

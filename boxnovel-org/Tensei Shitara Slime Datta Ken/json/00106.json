At a time like that, I think it might be best not to have Poison Nullification.</p><br/><p>After all, it's possible the food or drink could be poisoned. But I think everyone in there more or less had some poison resistance.</p><br/><p>Oh well. I just pretended to be drunk. After all, I just like the act of drinking itself.</p><br/><p>The ones who drank too much were the invited guests.</p><br/><p>It seems they couldn't forget the excitement of the battle they saw during the day... they all kept talking about it and drank late into the night.</p><br/><p>As a result, everyone looked exhausted heading over to the Colosseum the next morning.</p><br/><p>In the Colosseum, all of the contestants assembled, forming a line at the center.</p><br/><p>Or rather than a line, it was a linked circle. They stood in while facing the audience.</p><br/><p>On the large monitor, the contestants were projected on the screen one by one, their appearance came out nicely.</p><br/><p>In front of the contestants, I greeted everyone through the mike.</p><br/><p>By the way, I didn\u2019t call Veldora out since yesterday.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t dare to call him out while he's engrossed in making the Underground LabyrinthDungeon.</p><br/><p>If he starts raging again it will be troublesome, and at the same time that dangerous fellow might also come with him.</p><br/><p>If Milim comes, surely she will want to participate in the tournament. I don\u2019t think that she will be satisfied just sending in a substitute.</p><br/><p>For that reason, today's commentary will be performed by me alone. </p><br/><p>First thing first, the contestant introductions.</p><br/><p>I send the signal and the contestants were introduced one at a time.</p><br/><p>The large screen changed for the introduction of each contestant that will be battling today.</p><br/><p>First, the people who won yesterday's Battle Royal, those three people were introduced.</p><br/><p>As the representative of Souei\u2019s subordinates, the dragonewt Souka took on the role as the Announcer.</p><br/><p>She gave a brief commentary about the contestants that will participate in today's match.</p><br/><p>Well then, shall we begin?</p><br/><p>First was the Gozu.</p><br/><p>This guy... I gave him a \u201cName\u201d, \u201cGozurl\u201d. It was because he came out victorious yesterday and as my praise for him. </p><br/><p>After he received the name, my magic power decreased, although it decreased only to the extent that he could grow a little.</p><br/><p>However, he was formerly a high A-Rank.</p><br/><p>His race also evolves as Gyuuki[1].The way his power now gushed from him, he felt like a completely different person than he was yesterday.</p><br/><p>He has acquired a Unique Skill\u300eRestrainer\u300f[2] and an Extra Skill\u300eSelf Regeneration ex\u300f.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t receive additional special abilities or skills, his physical power was greatly enhanced.</p><br/><p>Unique Skill\u300eRestrainer\u300f's ability was to create a space where he could put a restraint on what ability can be used in that space.</p><br/><p>However, if the other party didn\u2019t agree with it, the restraint in that space will be canceled.</p><br/><p>It was ability with bad usability.</p><br/><p>Although it might be possible to force the opponent to agree with it, but I think that depends on who the opponent was.</p><br/><p>If it's an opponent of the same rank, it won\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, just like Holy Barrier, that space creates a rule where skills can\u2019t be used... but I speculate that physical ability will still be effective.</p><br/><p>It was an interesting idea.</p><br/><p>Since I think it could be useful (if I think of ways to use it), I didn\u2019t forget to absorb it with\u300eCovenant Lord Uriel\u300f.</p><br/><p>Because it was under the Space series, it was easy to add it.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, the champion of the yesterday\u2019s first match, Gozurl!</p><br/><p>By stopping the 100 years conflict, he received right to participate in this match!</p><br/><p>His power gives rise to a new wind that can sweep over Tempest!\u300d</p><br/><p>Souka spoke the words merrily.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t turn around.</p><br/><p>Since she's cute, the audience became excited.</p><br/><p>With the tail, the wings and the horn, there was no problem labeling her as \u201cCute\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300cFurthermore, Gozurl is a champion from the Underground LabyrinthDungeon that Tempest is proud of~!</p><br/><p>Pay attention to his strength! And for those who are confident that they can beat him, please head towards the labyrinth!!\u300d</p><br/><p>She said it in high spirits.</p><br/><p>She even advertised the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Because it's not opened to the public yet, it can\u2019t be considered a Labyrinth yet.</p><br/><p>Oh well, after seeing its power, I don\u2019t know if there will be a challenger for the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>I have no idea how the first match will turnout. Even after being advertised like this, he might be defeated quickly.</p><br/><p>However, I already thought that.</p><br/><p>If he got defeated, then his challenger will get an additional monetary reward.</p><br/><p>Well, it depends on his opponent. Everything will be decided by the lot.</p><br/><p>Next, Dagura.</p><br/><p>The eldest of Dagruel\u2019s three sons.</p><br/><p>I received greetings from Dagura, Ryura and Debura at the same time of the report of yesterday\u2019s victory.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been told that their father, Dagruel, sent them to this country so they could learn various things.</p><br/><p>\u300eWe will do anything, even the chores. Please give us your permission to stay in this country, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama! \u300f</p><br/><p>The trio bowed their head together.</p><br/><p>Because it was troublesome, I decide to place them under Shion. It was their wish after all. </p><br/><p>They even wear clothes with \u201cShion for Life\u201d written on them...</p><br/><p>I knew that the reality was cruel, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before their illusion gets broken, but that was their way of life.</p><br/><p>Their power was dreadfully high.</p><br/><p>However, the eldest was the most balanced one among the three, so he was quite strong.</p><br/><p>\u300cNext up is the champion of the second match, Dagura!!</p><br/><p>Emitting his overwhelming aura alone, all of the evil spirits from the Great Jura Forest were blown away!</p><br/><p>His figure is certainly a masterpiece. If he becomes serious, who knows what will happen!</p><br/><p>How will such power fare against the executives[3] of Tempest?</p><br/><p>The anticipation is rising!\u300d</p><br/><p>During his introduction Dagura waves his hand high.</p><br/><p>If compared with the quiet fighting spirit[4] of Gozurl, I could sense a surplus of power.</p><br/><p>How high was the surplus power that he held? Just like before, I didn\u2019t speak anything to the Executives.</p><br/><p>Then, the next one was the Hero Masayuki[5].</p><br/><p>It would become clear in today's match whether this guy's abilities were the real deal or not.</p><br/><p>Although, it might be tomorrow as there only four matches today, so it all depends on the lot.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd now, the champion of yesterday\u2019s third match, Hero Masayuki~!!</p><br/><p>No one could catch a glimpse at his magnificent sword technique! Because, at the same time his sword was unsheathed, the opponent was already dead[6]!</p><br/><p>With overwhelming power he made his name renowned--the man who introduces himself as the young Hero.</p><br/><p>There is no end of people who are fascinated by his sweet mask[7]. They say with just one look at his eyes, no woman can resist falling for him!</p><br/><p>Ma~sa~yu~ki~!! For those who have seen his previous battle, rejoice~!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Was it true?</p><br/><p>Was this guy really that popular?</p><br/><p>Or was Souka just making stuff up for that publicity?</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, she has an unexpected talent.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that mostly lies and backhanded compliments? What with that, \u201cMa~sa~yu~ki~!!\u201d announcement?</p><br/><p>If anyone took her words seriously, then I think there's something wrong with their heads.</p><br/><p>If he loses in the first round after that big speech, won't he be embarrassed?</p><br/><p>Maybe that was her plan. If so, that's just harassment.</p><br/><p>If it's Souka, then without doubt it's high class harassment[8].</p><br/><p>The remainders were special participants and the executives.</p><br/><p>Starting with Arnaud.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell~then, let's continue the contestant introduction with the special participants~!</p><br/><p>First introduction is for the Holy Knight Arnaud Bauman!</p><br/><p>The name of a man renowned as the strongest Holy Knight!</p><br/><p>After the zealous fight against our Tempest executives a bud of friendship has bloomed~!</p><br/><p>He aims for complete victory! The pride of a man doesn\u2019t allow a draw.</p><br/><p>To achieve his aims for complete victory, he will exhibit his true strength this time ~!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yes.</p><br/><p>An amazing ability, actually.</p><br/><p>Down the side of Arnaud's face, I see a sweat hanging on his forehead.[9]</p><br/><p>What was she talking about?</p><br/><p>It was completely unnecessary to say all of that. Now the pressure was on him to win.</p><br/><p>Souka, are you really a Blood-Sucking Demon? The way you're cornering them was not something just anyone would do.</p><br/><p>As the little sister of the naturally airheaded Gabil, I never imagined you could be so vicious.</p><br/><p>\u300cNext up, another special participant! His name is Damurada!</p><br/><p>Dispatched from a secret organization, he's a mysterious man!</p><br/><p>He aims to show off his combat prowess in this tournament~!</p><br/><p>Will he able to display his power as a mercenary!?</p><br/><p>The man who catches Demon Lord Rimuru-sama interest. Keep your eyes on him everyone!\u300d</p><br/><p>No, no......</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have the slightest interest in him. Also, what's the deal with the secret organization you speak of....?</p><br/><p>Saying that while looking at me with that fearless smile.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m glad there was no problem. I\u2019m glad that even if the name gets found out it will be fine.</p><br/><p>Well, I had been warned about this, but I will stop it if it becomes a problem.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s continue! Another special participant... a mysterious masked man intrudding the Colosseum~!</p><br/><p>The unknown Lion Mask! Is he a champion of justice or an envoy of evil!?</p><br/><p>Really, what kind of enchanting battle he will show us!?</p><br/><p>By the way, there\u2018s a message from a certain anonymous person.</p><br/><p>\u300eI think you already know, but if you show a unsightly fight, prepare yourself.\u300f</p><br/><p>That what the person said.</p><br/><p>What does this message mean? I don\u2019t know, but it sounds fun~!\u300d</p><br/><p>No, his fate was already sealed.</p><br/><p>Souka already knew that but she still took pleasure in cornering him.</p><br/><p>I had no choice other than to pray for the cornered Lion Mask\u2019s fortune in the match.</p><br/><p>\u300cContinuing, the final special participant.</p><br/><p>The Ultimate Battle Machine! In front of it, both Holy and Evil[10] hold no meaning!</p><br/><p>I have received a written introduction from an anonymous person.</p><br/><p>\u300eMy Beretta, is the Strongest\u300f[11]</p><br/><p>That\u2019s all it says.</p><br/><p>However, isn't this it's first real combat?</p><br/><p>How can it already be the strongest? I really don't understand, but anyway! This raises our anticipation even higher!\u300d</p><br/><p>N~o.</p><br/><p>I really didn\u2019t expect this, you know?</p><br/><p>She finished the forcefully overbearing introduction.</p><br/><p>Certainly, the people who know about the existence of Beretta were few, so its power was unknown.</p><br/><p>So there was nothing wrong in her words.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, from this point on the truly strong ones will make their appearance!</p><br/><p>The executives of Tempest.</p><br/><p>Each one's abilities are equal that of a thousand warriors.</p><br/><p>First up: Go~Bu~Ta~!!</p><br/><p>There are many who admire that nihilistic mask[12] of his, an elite warrior!</p><br/><p>Although he wished to have fame as a genius, he is the greatest of all young warriors.</p><br/><p>What kind of enticing battle will he show us this time?!\u300d</p><br/><p>Stop that ssu~!! Was probably what Gobuta\u2019s heart was screaming right now.</p><br/><p>His face also turned pale, you know.</p><br/><p>That was so, after all, he was in a sorry state similar to the half-killed Lion Mask-san</p><br/><p>Oh, well...</p><br/><p>If Gobuta were desperate, he might become serious.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe next contestant is Gabil!</p><br/><p>Commander of the Hiryuu[13], a warrior of the blue sky.</p><br/><p>Will his dragon\u2019s blood that flows in his body awaken an invincible warrior in him!?</p><br/><p>By the way, he is my biological brother.</p><br/><p>Since father is watching, you can\u2019t show us a pathetic battle, you hear me?!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ah.......</p><br/><p>No mercy, even for her biological brother.</p><br/><p>Of course not, since her performance was to drive everyone into a corner.</p><br/><p>Since no one knows who's fighting who, I might actually get to see Gabil unexpectedly awaken.</p><br/><p>And since it\u2019s true that Abil was watching, I think I can look forward to it a little. </p><br/><p>\u300cThat's it for the Sideshow[14]! Now we're on to the Main Show[15]!</p><br/><p>Continuing the introduction, the High Orc Gerudo!</p><br/><p>Tempest Guardian Deity. A crucial guardian with impregnable defense!\u300d</p><br/><p>Uh, did she just say \"sideshow\"?</p><br/><p>Certainly, the people after this were really strong. She changed her tone and went into her serious introduction mode.</p><br/><p>\u300cContestant Hakurou, master of the sword.</p><br/><p>Appointed as the Sword Art[16] Instructor, he is also the one who trained us.</p><br/><p>Contestant Shion, Demon Lord Rimuru's number one secretary!</p><br/><p>Fitting her intellectual appearance, she is a woman who can do anything.</p><br/><p>She not only protects Rimuru-sama, but also counsels him. It can be said that she has monopolized the position that is yearned by every woman.\u300d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>Was there some kind of secret dealing?</p><br/><p>I can't help but notice that Shion was nodding in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Somehow or another, there was no mistake that some black dealings had been carried out here.</p><br/><p>\u300cSouei-sama! He is my superior, and a manperson of yearning.</p><br/><p>Everything he does is flawless, but there is nobody who knows his true strength.</p><br/><p>I'm sure this time too, he will surely show us a splendid and wonderful battle!\u300d</p><br/><p>Do you need to add -sama to Souei?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, her tone was serious but she was clearly blushing.</p><br/><p>Oh well, its fine.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, the sole contestant in this tournament that is not a humanoid but a beast[17], Ranga!</p><br/><p>Reigning as Rimuru-sama\u2019s GuardPet, a superior wolf that allows no one to come near!</p><br/><p>And now...the top favorite of this tournament, contestant Diablo!</p><br/><p>Needless to say but no one has seen his true abilities in live combat.</p><br/><p>Will there be a contestant this time that can expose his secrets? Is there anyone in existence that can do it!?</p><br/><p>It will be a match on whole new levels!</p><br/><p>Next contestant is the last contestant!</p><br/><p>Tempest supreme commander, contestant Benimaru!</p><br/><p>Among the subordinates of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, his power is said to be the strongest, but just how strong is he?</p><br/><p>Rumor has it that he is equal in strength to Souei-sama, but is it true!?</p><br/><p>It's time for the truth to be made clear in the eyes of the public!\u300d</p><br/><p>As expected, the last introduction was normal.</p><br/><p>But, who really is the strongest? I don\u2019t honestly know.</p><br/><p>Diablo, Ranga, Souei, Benimaru.</p><br/><p>In addition of the strong four, Shion and Beretta.</p><br/><p>Because they learnt their techniques from Hakurou, recently they have leveled up.....</p><br/><p>Also, that Lion Mask... was the former Demon Lord Karion-san, right?</p><br/><p>Against a former Demon Lord, how far can our executives fight?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m really looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>As the introductions came to an end, lots were drawn and the matches were decided.</p><br/><p>Due to the number of participants, the match will be divided into two days. Four matches on the first day and another four on the second day.</p><br/><p>Immediately after the lots were drawn, names were filled out on the tournament chart.</p><br/><p>The result...</p><br/><p>The First Day</p><br/><p>1st match \u2026\u2026 Benimaru vs Gozurl</p><br/><p>2nd match \u2026\u2026 Souei vs Dagura</p><br/><p>3rd match \u2026\u2026 Gobuta vs Hero Masayuki</p><br/><p>4th match \u2026\u2026 Gabil vs Ranga</p><br/><p>The Second Day</p><br/><p>5th match \u2026\u2026 Arnaud vs Beretta</p><br/><p>6th match \u2026\u2026 Lion Mask vs Diablo</p><br/><p>7th match \u2026\u2026 Hakurou vs Damurada</p><br/><p>8th match \u2026\u2026 Gerudo vs Shion</p><br/><p>That was the result.</p><br/><p>Because the matches were made fair and square by drawing lots, so there were no hard feelings, but Gabil looked awfully pitiful.</p><br/><p>His unique skill, \"Tuner[18]\", would work fine if he was matched up against an opponent he can win against, but since his opponent was Ranga, it might be impossible to win.</p><br/><p>He wore an expression of hopelessness. I hope he will still work hard and show us his utmost best.</p><br/><p>And then there was Gobuta...</p><br/><p>If the hero really was the same rank as Hinata, Gobuta's chance of victory was nonexistent.</p><br/><p>But as far as testing the Hero's ability, Gobuta might be suitable for that.</p><br/><p>I also want him to work hard and perform his utmost best.</p><br/><p>After this, it will become a considerable great match that I want to see.</p><br/><p>By the way, Wisdom King Raphael had perfectly predicted the outcome of these matches.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t say anything, so it might be interesting.</p><br/><p>Because there was free will, there might be case where the contestant actions could overturn even 10.000 calculations, so it can\u2019t reach any conclusion.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, if the contestants were manipulated, then it could be possible to make a 100% perfect forecast.</p><br/><p>Well then, now, I somehow expected it, how the result will be.</p><br/><p>Without delay, the first match had begun.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>The first match\u2026\u2026Benimaru vs Gozurl!</p><br/><p>For some reason, they were just glaring at each other in the middle of the arena.</p><br/><p>Neither showed any response to Souka's \u300cBegin!\u300d.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu, how lucky to be able to meet you in the first match.</p><br/><p>Benimaru-san, your reign as the supreme commander will end today!</p><br/><p>Today onwards shall be known as the era of Gozurl-sama!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gozurl was spouting remarks one after another.</p><br/><p>This was ba~d. After receiving a name and gains new powers, it seems he's become rather arrogant.</p><br/><p>Was this also...a rebellion against me[19]... or so I'd like to think, however...</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease watch me, Rimuru-sama!</p><br/><p>I, Gozurl, will become your new right hand.</p><br/><p>And if I do then I shall take Shion-dono as my bride!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He respectfully bows towards me, while declaring such things.</p><br/><p>To his remarks,</p><br/><p>\u300eShion-sama is my, our bride!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The crowd booed at him.</p><br/><p>It seemed that one section of the spectators were all crazy fans of Shion.</p><br/><p>Ah well. So foolish.</p><br/><p>Nothing I can do. Let the match begin...</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, do the match seriously.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t need foolish words.\u300d</p><br/><p>Since I said it into the mike, it echoed throughout the Colosseum.</p><br/><p>The spectators burst out in laughter, I guess they think this was just part of the show.</p><br/><p>Since I was being serious, I'm really thankful that they misunderstood.</p><br/><p>I was quite embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u300cBegin!\u300d</p><br/><p>Once again, Souka declared.</p><br/><p>This time it began for real.</p><br/><p>Gozurl made the first move. And thus, a large magic formation suddenly appeared on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cTake this! The position of supreme commander will be mine!</p><br/><p>Unique Skill, \u300eRestrainer\u300f, executed!\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh, he sure wasted no time using it.</p><br/><p>It was not an ability that a fool can use. The magic formation that was drawn on the ground... was it a prevention against cancellation?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m impressed.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how I see it, Benimaru was deliberately receiving that.</p><br/><p>Even when provoked to that extent, there was no sign of rage in him... quite different from his former self.</p><br/><p>After he was entrusted as the supreme commander of this country, Benimaru's short temper disappeared.</p><br/><p>And the now calm Benimaru was tremendously strong.</p><br/><p>If he fought against Hakurou now, their swords would clash endlessly.</p><br/><p>It was after suppressing his physical strength to same level of Hakurou. In other words, his sword skill was now at the same level as Hakurou's.</p><br/><p>Without his short temper he can carefully listens to his opponent\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Hence was his growth.</p><br/><p>Due to the restraining ability of Gozurl\u2019s\u300eRestrainer\u300f, Skill, sorcery, and magic were prohibited.[20] See the note</p><br/><p>\u300cWahahahaha! I hear that your specialty is Inferno[21] attack, right?</p><br/><p>How\u2019s that!? How does it feel to have your special technique sealed?!</p><br/><p>Just hand over the supreme commander position to me now, and I might make you my vice commander. You can become my right hand, how about that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmm.</p><br/><p>Gozurl was too elated.[22]</p><br/><p>It seems to be a bad idea to hand out names so easily, since it seems that it could mass produce idiots like him.</p><br/><p>Even if he's loyal to me, he didn\u2019t takes into consideration the power of his senpai, whom he should respect.</p><br/><p>However. It\u2019d be different if said senpai was making a mistake.</p><br/><p>Even Diablo was polite when he meets with opponents that were weaker than him.</p><br/><p>Well, he's really frightening when he's angered, though his attitude is that he never underestimates anyone...</p><br/><p>Well then, how will Benimaru fight back?</p><br/><p>If this was before, the opponent will be killed at this stage. Thanks goodness it was only half-killing.</p><br/><p>Believing he sealed off his opponent\u2019s ability, Gozurl, who became too elated, he attacked Benimaru incessantly with his Great Axe.</p><br/><p>Since Benimaru's Magic and other skills were sealed off, Gozurl seemed to believe that he now had the upper hand in both power and speed.</p><br/><p>However...</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, is that the extent of your power?</p><br/><p>Do you have anything else besides that?</p><br/><p>30 minutes will soon pass. Until that time, I allow you to attack as you like.</p><br/><p>Give it all you've got so you don't have any regrets later.\u300d</p><br/><p>30 minutes.</p><br/><p>That was the match time I set beforehand.</p><br/><p>One match was about 30 minutes; it was something that I had consulted with Benimaru beforehand.</p><br/><p>So that means, for the sake of punctually, he's deliberately allowing his opponent to attack as he likes?</p><br/><p>I was nothing but astonished at the growth of Benimaru.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? Are you sleep-talking?</p><br/><p>You're just receiving all of my attacks since the truth is you can't do anything against them, am I right?!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t be a sore loser! Don\u2019t get carried away, chump!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gozurl doesn\u2019t seem to realize the difference in their ability. It seems he still believes that he's attacking Benimaru one-sidedly.</p><br/><p>Gozurl... above Benimaru in power and speed?</p><br/><p>No, that was wrong.</p><br/><p>That Benimaru, without me knowing, his abilities increased drastically.</p><br/><p>His maximum amount of Energy Magic power had probably increased a substantial amount.</p><br/><p>It was only because he suppressed his youki[23] that its increase went unnoticed.</p><br/><p>Wisdom King Rafael usually conducts measurement without failure, but I didn\u2019t hear anything even from him.</p><br/><p>And so, 30 minutes had elapsed.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s time.\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru mutters lazily as Gozurl fell to his knees on the spot.</p><br/><p>In Benimaru\u2019s left hand was a Katana with a crimson blade called Crimson Lotus Edge[24].

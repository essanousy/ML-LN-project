Setting Off</p><br/><p>Hinata returned from her attack on Tempest\u2013which would later be called the \u201cTemplar Captain\u2019s revolt\u201d\u2013having suffered a crushing defeat.</p><br/><p>Without a single apology or excuse, Hinata resigned as the head of the imperial guard and cut all ties with the Holy Empire Ruberion.</p><br/><p>As such, even the Empire\u2019s representatives, the Seven Celestial Sages could not punish her. Therefore, they simply decided to continue observing the situation.</p><br/><p>The Western Saint\u2019s Church, however, could not stay silent.</p><br/><p>She selfishly went off on her own and even lost. Losing to monsters is a problem in itself, but she even dared to return alive. And even confirmed that those remaining in Tempest were alive and well.</p><br/><p>In other worlds, they came as assassins but were defeated fair and square. That\u2019s not a mistake one can easily recover from.</p><br/><p>In fact, had they all died, the Church could have attributed it to monsters\u2019 wicked and cruel nature, rile up all of humanity, and\u2026.</p><br/><p>For the Church, this is by far the worst outcome.</p><br/><p>Even then, Nicholas was happy that Hinata returned.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s a different matter. The problem remains.</p><br/><p>And then, to Nicholas, who was holding his head, Hinata so said:</p><br/><p>\u300cJust say that I acted on my own. Fooled the knights and acted without the Church\u2019s approval.</p><br/><p>Though it will contradict the Church\u2019s dogma that all monsters are evil, but at least it won\u2019t subvert all of it.</p><br/><p>After all, the weak need the Church.</p><br/><p>We can\u2019t go around losing an organization that is willing to extend the weak a hand, now can we?\u300d</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation she proposed to Nicholas.</p><br/><p>Just as before, as if looking down upon the world she presented the most logical conclusion.</p><br/><p>If necessary, cut away one to save the whole\u2013perfectly pragmatic.</p><br/><p>Even if the one to be cut away is she herself, she would not hesitate.</p><br/><p>But still, she seems to have changed a bit: no longer are her eyes filled with blind devotion to the creed.</p><br/><p>Her face instead carries a smile of nearly divine kindness.</p><br/><p>And this was a proposal Nicholas could not refuse.</p><br/><p>Though her face now expresses heartfelt kindness, it did not change her nature. Her proposal is well thought out and the Church would suffer minimal damage as the result. Nicholas understood that too well.</p><br/><p>\u300cHinata, did you change a bit\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHave I? Can\u2019t know yourself, now can you? But I do think that I was in too much of a hurry. To save people with my own hands, so I thought. I don\u2019t think I was wrong to sacrifice the few to save the many. I can proudly say that I fought for what I believed in. But\u2026 I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to try to save everyone. I think I was too focused on the big picture and lost something important. I don\u2019t want to save just the majority\u2013I want to save everyone. Feel free to laugh if you think it impossible. I just want to see the world, judge it with my own eyes, and pick the path I truly believe in\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that what the Demon Lord taught you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, not really. A beloved teacher admonished me, and I recognized the existence of a demon lord\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRecognized\u2026 a demon lord?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. It was not pure evil. Just another soul living quite selfishly\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so\u2026 Well then, I will believe in you Hinata-sama. And the Demon Lord whom you believed in\u300d</p><br/><p>For Nicholas, Hinata is and was everything.</p><br/><p>Even if she lost, he could not complain if she returned alive.</p><br/><p>If the Empire decided to punish Hinata, he fully intended to use the West Saint\u2019s Church to defend her.</p><br/><p>This time, however, it was unnecessary because Hinata herself decided to resign from her post.</p><br/><p>And disposing of the whole affair as the \u201cTemplar Captain\u2019s Revolt,\u201d Hinata became a stray adventurer.</p><br/><p>One who gives hope to the weak\u2013a Hero.</p><br/><p>The knight who lived by the creed was dead, and instead the hope of the people was born. Nicholas understood this as well.</p><br/><p>Thus, he did not oppose her actions. Later, he would come to regret it.</p><br/><p>Hinata then assembled the Templars and the Blood Shadows and declared that she steps down from her post.</p><br/><p>The Templars were content but the shadows opposed her declaration.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\u300cHinata-sama has been corrupted! She has become weak from her defeat. Actually, the demon lord must have seduced her. We need to open her eyes!\u300d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>And various other things the shadows said, troubling Hinata.</p><br/><p>To them,</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, that country\u2019s demon lord has created a dungeon.</p><br/><p>If you clear it you get an audience with the demon lord.</p><br/><p>So if you want to \u201copen my eyes,\u201d go clear it first\u300d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Hinata said, and the Blood Shadows, as if having received their orders, departed.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Nicholas asked,</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\u300cProbably. No one dies in that dungeon.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord manages it for fun.</p><br/><p>But it just might become good practice for them.</p><br/><p>Maybe they\u2019ll go mad, but it just might reforge their spirits\u300d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>She said without thinking.</p><br/><p>Having faced Demon Lord Rimuru once before she has some trust in him.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also the fact that Arnaud is there and has related enough for her to make her own conjectures.</p><br/><p>She also has a good idea as to how to clear that dungeon.</p><br/><p>Besides, perhaps only Hinata could, but those shadows would be unable to clear the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Blood crazed and seeing nothing but dogma, the labyrinth may only break their spirits.</p><br/><p>In fact, later on this became a sort of pilgrimage for forging your spirit.</p><br/><p>You would challenge that hell again and again, as long as your spirit doesn\u2019t break.</p><br/><p>As Hinata said, it became a place for those weak-willed to gain some mental strength.</p><br/><p>And the remaining Blood Shadows returned to the Holy Empire of Ruberion.</p><br/><p>Since they were affiliated with the Empire anyways, they simply swore loyalty to the Emperor.</p><br/><p>And upon seeing these men again, Hinata</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\u300cWho would\u2019ve thought\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>She lamented.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Their presence stank of blood.</p><br/><p>That she noticed one time when she was reporting a matter at the Empire.</p><br/><p>She concluded that their journey to the dungeon was the reason for their much to mechanical and artificial movement.</p><br/><p>But back to present time,</p><br/><p>Excusing herself before the Seven Celestial Sages was a trial in itself.</p><br/><p>If she fought would she win or lose? The thing is, they gave off magic power unbecoming of humans.</p><br/><p>Why she had not noticed it was a mystery in itself.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s because her \u201cHero\u201d egg has increased a level allowing her to feel their real presence, but she did not know this at the time.)</p><br/><p>She figured that being focused on the whole made her blind to such an obvious fact.</p><br/><p>So even though she was not wrong she simply was not right either. And this mistake too would lead to her growth.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Holy Empire of Ruberion was most likely a temporary form.</p><br/><p>The real form was of a city controlled by powerful, demon lord level, monsters.</p><br/><p>A monster city undiscovered for many hundreds of years, where human thoughts are manipulated.</p><br/><p>Not that they are being brainwashed, but undoing the teachings of the Empire is most likely impossible.</p><br/><p>What terrifying foes they are, Hinata thought.</p><br/><p>At this point, Hinata could not raise a sword against them.</p><br/><p>A monster who does not wish to recognize other monsters? No, not simple lack of recognition, but outright hostility?</p><br/><p>Either way, an enemy who hides behind a veil of humility is far more dangerous than one in plain sight.</p><br/><p>Before, Hinata would have charged at them demanding a fight. But now she fully thinks through her actions.</p><br/><p>Because she wishes to think through things in greater depth.</p><br/><p>Not picking the path of least resistance but also considering the longest alternative.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s not like she\u2019s lost right no.w</p><br/><p>Hinata left the West Saint\u2019s Church.</p><br/><p>Nicholas and the knights follow behind her.</p><br/><p>She asked him to make Vice Captain Leonard the Captain and Arnaud remained as his Vice Captain.</p><br/><p>\u300cI hear and obey. I will do as you have instructed without delay.</p><br/><p>However, Hinata-sama, this is also your home.</p><br/><p>Please return to us at any time. We shall await your return\u300d</p><br/><p>And at Nicholas\u2019 words, other knights also bowed their heads.</p><br/><p>Even recalling this scene now, these words warm her heart.</p><br/><p>Though she lived discarding what she had no use for, she was able to acquire truly kind comrades.</p><br/><p>For their sake she should not remain there any longer.</p><br/><p>But,</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you okay?\u300d</p><br/><p> Without turning around she asked one of the people following her.</p><br/><p> .</p><br/><p>\u300cNo problem. My spirit was broken quite a few times during that fight.</p><br/><p>That curr (Ranga), was it\u2026</p><br/><p>Besides, after talking to them at that banquet, I have realized my own narrowmindedness.</p><br/><p>Please take me along with you. Besides,</p><br/><p>The West Saints\u2019 Church needs people, so they won\u2019t be able to spare any as your guards.</p><br/><p>Well, I probably do for a poor guard, but please let me do it!</p><br/><p>We probably would never meet another monster like that curr again!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo as you like. What a whimsical fellow.</p><br/><p>But thanks\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah! When I said do as you like I didn\u2019t mean you are free to crawl into my bed. That I won\u2019t permit\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWha! Who do you think I am?!</p><br/><p>I would never dare to touch Hinata-sama!</p><br/><p>Besides, I would be crucified by Cardinal Nicholas\u300d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy seriously doesn\u2019t know how to hold back, he\u2019d seriously kill me!\u201d And various other such lines Fritz mumbled, causing a small smile to break out on Hinata\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Fritz saw that smile and was immediately at loss for words.</p><br/><p>This is bad, he thought, seriously\u2026 For a second, I would not have minded being killed\u2026</p><br/><p>Feeling a chill, Fritz dispelled these thoughts.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Beautiful but lacking humanity. Overwhelming in strength, but lacking in feminine charm.</p><br/><p> .</p><br/><p>So was she known among people. Fritz was no exception and did not see her as a member of the opposite sex.</p><br/><p>But, that smile blew all these preconceptions away.</p><br/><p>This is bad, he thought, didn\u2019t think this post would come with such a side benefit\u2026 but if others find out, I\u2019ll have more people to compete against!</p><br/><p>Having come down a bit, Fritz tried to order his feelings.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s alright, no problem. He steadied his trembling heart and oriented himself towards his normal train of thought.</p><br/><p>Completely oblivious to his struggles, Hinata put on her glasses, leaned her head on his shoulder and looked up at him.</p><br/><p>And with a weak smile,</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, you\u2019ll take care of me, won\u2019t you? Fritz\u300d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>She said.</p><br/><p>And that was the death knell of his reason.</p><br/><p>(Cardinal Nicholas, I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s open season now!)</p><br/><p>This was the moment when Fritz decided to treat her not as a guard captain but as a woman to be protected.</p><br/><p>And his feelings towards her were not of loyalty towards a guard captain but of an earnest desire to follow her.</p><br/><p>And thus their journey began.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Hinata was concerned about the five children Rimuru mentioned.</p><br/><p>Nearing Kagurazaka Yuuki is dangerous but she had her anti-mind control item equipped. ANd she did not intend to be reckless.</p><br/><p>She merely wanted to confirm the situation and rescue the kids if possible.</p><br/><p>What relationship stands between Yuuki and Chaos Lord Gazalim is a concern, but she intended to avoid any and all contact with him.</p><br/><p>She did not think she would lose, but Shizu-san asked her to avoid him and she intended to keep her promise.</p><br/><p>But, Chaos Lord Gazalim.</p><br/><p>If he is manipulating Yuuki\u2026 she would not allow that to go unpunished.</p><br/><p>Having been manipulated for over ten years it isn\u2019t something she can forgive.</p><br/><p>In her memories Yuuki was a boy with a wide smile.</p><br/><p>(I must confirm if that smile was genuine. And save the kids.)</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way. Thus Hinata decided to act.</p><br/><p>She headed out to Ingrasia Kingdom.</p><br/><p>The city brainwashed by Yuuki, or perhaps by Gazalim.</p><br/><p>Traveling by the magic circle may alert him, should there be spies, so instead she journeyed there on foot.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>And a new struggle was on the horizon\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

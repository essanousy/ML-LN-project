SWORD OF TEMPEST</p><br/><p>I succeeded in freeing Veldora.</p><br/><p>But the danger still loomed.</p><br/><p>Basically, these were \u201cScorch Dragon\u201d Velgrynd, the Emperor, and finally, the army uniform guy who had shot at Veldora.</p><br/><p>There were several others who could also be placed under the label of \u201cdanger\u201d, and I wanted to get rid of them all at once.</p><br/><p>But really, other than those first three, the others didn\u2019t feel like a \u201cdanger\u201d at all.</p><br/><p>My body, having transformed into that of a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d with its Energy reaching the greatest heights, had yet again drastically exceeded in power in both quality and quantity.</p><br/><p>So much that, now, I could probably pack a punch against even Milim or Guy.</p><br/><p>But, I shouldn\u2019t get conceited, or something bad might happen; truly, negligence is sin.</p><br/><p>I will finish off all of them, leaving behind not a single drop of blood.</p><br/><p>That being said, the Black Numbers had already done quite a number on them, and it seemed like only the strongest of them remained.</p><br/><p>Well, as long as there weren\u2019t any casualties\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Were they following my order to not die?</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll worry about that later.</p><br/><p>As there was an enraged Velgrynd approaching as we speak.</p><br/><p>First, I think I should let Veldora come out using Storm Dragon Release.</p><br/><p>My Energy wasn\u2019t always at full capacity probably because, I let Veldora roam freely.</p><br/><p>But because Veldora\u2019s power was overflowing into me, the circulation had caused a revitalization effect on my body.</p><br/><p>Before attaining the nature of a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d, I had been using a large portion of energy to maintain releasing Veldora\u2015\u2015 but that neither caused me inconvenience nor did I particularly feel anything from it \u2015\u2015 but now, I only needed to allocate around 30% of my energy for the upkeep.</p><br/><p>Well, there weren\u2019t any problems using large scale magic despite that, so I didn\u2019t think too deeply about it.</p><br/><p>Thinking that, as I was about to perform Storm Dragon Release,</p><br/><p>(Wait. I requested that Wisdom Lord to enhance my Skills.)</p><br/><p>\u300aAlert. Currently in the process of synchronization of Master and individual: Veldora\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>Currently engaged in evolving \u300eInvestigation King Faust\u300finto \u300eChaos Lord Nyarlathotep\u300f.</p><br/><p>Please delay usage of Storm Dragon Release until completion.\u300b</p><br/><p>Both of them stopped me.</p><br/><p>Apparently it was Veldora\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t informed me, so that must have been the case.</p><br/><p>I wanted to tell them to do it some other time, but it\u2019s probably something that can\u2019t be done after Releasing.</p><br/><p>I guess it couldn\u2019t be helped, and would be harder to do later, but then,</p><br/><p>\u300aSolution. From the analysis of individual: Veldora\u2019s Skills, ability to evolve Ultimate Skill \u300eStorm King Veldora\u300fconfirmed.</p><br/><p>Consequently, Ultimate Skill \u300eCovenant King Uriel\u300fwill be erased.</p><br/><p>Would you like to synthesize Ultimate SKill \u300eStellar-Wind Lord Hastur\u300f? YES/ NO \u300b</p><br/><p>Wisdom Lord Raphael informs me almost as a side note.</p><br/><p>Good lord\u2026\u2026 this Raphael-san doesn\u2019t intend to slow down at all.</p><br/><p>To think of reconstructing Skills mid-fight, just how relaxed was she?</p><br/><p>As if \u201cScorch Dragon\u201d Velgrynd didn\u2019t matter at all.</p><br/><p>For now, it\u2019s a NO.</p><br/><p>Really, I did still have Gluttony King Belzebuth, but that didn\u2019t mean we should let our guard down.</p><br/><p>Rather, to fight a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d with only Belzebuth?</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you overestimating me a bit too much? I kept thinking.</p><br/><p>After this battle, along with my subordinates getting their Demon Lord ascensions done with, I guess I\u2019ll also undergo a massive Skill overhaul.</p><br/><p>Just what was I going to be made to become, I decided to think about it later.</p><br/><p>Now then, what to do about this \u201cScorch Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>The quality and quantity of my Energy had increased, and so had my strength.</p><br/><p>I was thinking of testing out these powers, and wanted to dive into battle, but as Wisdom Lord Raphael was in the process of refining Veldora\u2019s Skills, close-quarters combat seemed like a bad idea.</p><br/><p>I guess it wasn\u2019t too bad to fight head on, but getting damaged on top of using up Energy for attacks could make things troublesome.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want any weird effects from damage.</p><br/><p>Therefore, I wanted to maintain some distance, and finish this with ranged attacks.</p><br/><p>This was strategy, not cowardice.</p><br/><p>If I could win easily, I shouldn\u2019t hesitate and just do it.</p><br/><p>Though I say that, I didn\u2019t really have many ranged attack options.</p><br/><p>Covenant King Uriel\u2019s Severance Series abilities were powerful, but their effective range was rather small.</p><br/><p>It was a fearsome power like Dimension Severance, so obviously it was restricted to a certain range.</p><br/><p>So that leaves, Magic?</p><br/><p>Among the Nuclear Magics, there was one emission type attack more suited to ranged combat.</p><br/><p>\u201cNuclear Cannon\u201d, a type of laser cannon.</p><br/><p>It was relatively easy to control, so human Great Mages seemed to prefer it.</p><br/><p>That is to say, it was the easiest to control of the Nuclear Magics.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the cost-performance was pretty good too. Right now, my mana recovery rate was higher than its usage cost, so I could fire all I wanted without worrying about depletion.</p><br/><p>That catch was, it definitely wouldn\u2019t have any effect on Velgrynd.</p><br/><p>This was an emission attack that used concentrated mana particles, but at the end of the day, it was a heat based attack.</p><br/><p>Against Velgrynd, who governed \u201cHeat\u201d, it would be useless. Even if it was overlapped with the effects of Ultimate Skills, she could probably easily Resist it.</p><br/><p>It was the most powerful of the Emission type attacks, but it was useless if there was no effect.</p><br/><p>Really, what to do\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It suddenly came to me.</p><br/><p>There was a new ability added to \u201cStorm King Veldora\u201d.</p><br/><p>Reconstructed from \u201cStorm Blast\u201d, it was an ability called \u201cStorm Lightning\u201d.</p><br/><p>At present, it was in fact the strongest long range attack in my possession.</p><br/><p>This may just work on Velgrynd from a distance.</p><br/><p>I wanted to try out this \u201cStorm Lightning\u201d right away but \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 I happened to notice another thing I just had to try.</p><br/><p>Bladed Storm: Crystallization, Transforming into a Blade Core\u2026\u2026 ?</p><br/><p>It\u2019d been re~ally bothering me for a while now, what was this thing?</p><br/><p>That said, I couldn\u2019t let my guard down around Raphael-san.</p><br/><p>What in the world do you have to do, to evolve this overpowered Storm King Veldora into an Stellar-Wind Lord Hastur; I had not Idea at all.</p><br/><p>Apparently it would integrate with Covenant King Uriel, but what about the usability?</p><br/><p>Well whatever.</p><br/><p>The Bladed Storm did seem interesting, but it looked like it was a non ranged power.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll ignore it for now. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m supposed to crystallize in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u300aSolution. Ranged attacks possible with \u201cBladed Storm\u201d.</p><br/><p>Condensing the full spirit strength of Storm King Veldora, it is possible to launch a vectorized Energy blast.</p><br/><p>Unlike Storm Dragon Release, which is being withheld to reconnect the Soul Corridor, it is possible to use this at present.\u300b</p><br/><p>So crystallization means, the power from releasing Veldora, is directly injected into a sword?</p><br/><p>Which would mean that this sword represented all of Veldora\u2019s power\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300aSolution. That inference can be considered correct.\u300b</p><br/><p>Ok.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably like Veldora and me attacking at once, so it\u2019s the most powerful attack I have right now.</p><br/><p>Since I decided not to relax, I\u2019ll go for it.</p><br/><p>I timidly attempted to perform the Bladed Storm.</p><br/><p>\u300aAlert. Individual: Veldora\u2019s consent affirmed. Initializing Crystallization.\u300b</p><br/><p>Right then, the handle of my sword crystallized with a purple glow.</p><br/><p>I felt my hand connected to Veldora through the sword.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the sword had become part of my body.</p><br/><p>As expected, my Energy levels dropped by 30%.</p><br/><p>As I thought, it wasn\u2019t the Summoning, but the Release that drained the 30%.</p><br/><p>And the crystallization seemed to cause the same effect.</p><br/><p>In other words, this sword was like the manifestation of all of Veldora\u2019s Energy.</p><br/><p>Along with the Bladed Storm, as if right on time, Velgrynd started to move.</p><br/><p>It was a good time as any, so as a little test, I made a swing at Velgrynd.</p><br/><p>Well, it was more a thoughtless flick of the wrist really.</p><br/><p>And seeing that move, Velgrynd attempted a dodge.</p><br/><p>It was likely a normal reaction for her.</p><br/><p>Or maybe, it was her instincts doing the work.</p><br/><p>But as a result, that very act of evasion saved her life.</p><br/><p>A single swing of that sword had pierced the heavens, and split the seas.</p><br/><p>Literally.</p><br/><p>The deadly shockwave had no resemblance to the action of a sword, and cut down Velgrynd\u2019s wings mid-evasion.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s strength still not waning, it split multiple Imperial Airships in two along its path.</p><br/><p>And It didn\u2019t end there either.</p><br/><p>The Energy of the swing even cut apart the ocean.</p><br/><p>The waters divided.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t represent what unfolded below me in any other words.</p><br/><p>Something like an electric field coating the split ocean, was keeping the waters apart.</p><br/><p>The released Energy seemed to be further increasing the gap.</p><br/><p>What kind of joke is this\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I think I had the right to think that.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t mean to do this at all, it was only a simple swing.</p><br/><p>Et Voila the result, I also felt a large quantity of my energy being used up.</p><br/><p>\u300aReport. Failure occurred in controlling \u201cSword of Tempest\u201d. Energy usage was higher than predicted.\u300b</p><br/><p>Failure, huh\u2026. That aint the problem!</p><br/><p>No one cares about the Energy usage!</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s certainly not good, but back to the point.</p><br/><p>The point was: the output.</p><br/><p>We literally broke the ocean dammit! Normal environmental destruction looks like a joke in comparison\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Plus, the range was super long, and the damage was unreal too.</p><br/><p>It was so big, I probably needed to blacklist it.</p><br/><p>(Kuahahahaha! My bad, my bad. Put a little too much umph into it.)</p><br/><p>So he was the cause\u2026.</p><br/><p>I was really glad we were in over water.</p><br/><p>If this was in the middle of a city, it wouldn\u2019t just be a town disappearing, there was enough power to endanger an entire country.</p><br/><p>It seemed that control was divided between the wills of both me and Veldora, and it seemed like the output this time was caused by Veldora.</p><br/><p>Does that mean, if i also wanted to attack, the output would be even higher?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s too scary!</p><br/><p>This sword is too dangerous, it felt like a cheat item.</p><br/><p>(Hey, that was way overboard you know?</p><br/><p>Look, even your big sis looks like she doesn\u2019t understand what just happened, and is totally out of it.)</p><br/><p>(Heh, that\u2019s fine. If it\u2019s my elder sister, she wouldn\u2019t die even if she took a direct hit.)</p><br/><p>(That isn\u2019t the point\u2026\u2026 But enough, I\u2019ll be controlling the output from now on.)</p><br/><p>(Yeah, got it. No problem!)</p><br/><p>Geez Louise.</p><br/><p>If this happened every time, sooner or later places would become uninhabitable.</p><br/><p>Veldora had given the green light too, gotta keep the power down.</p><br/><p>\u300cB-bastard! What, was that? What the hell was that!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Velgrynd who came back to her senses, screamed at me, in a mix of anger and fear.</p><br/><p>Really, someone needs to tell me.</p><br/><p>But, if i had to answer,</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, Veldora Sword?\u300d</p><br/><p>I answered so.</p><br/><p>With that single attack, it looked as if the battle was decided.</p><br/><p>That one attack which pierced the heavens and split the seas was enough to utterly crush the spirits of the Imperial soldiers.</p><br/><p>Multi-layered barriers were sliced through like a hot knife through butter, there was also nowhere to escape being out at sea.</p><br/><p>Even if they managed to move beyond the speed of sound, it meant nothing if they couldn\u2019t outrun the attack.</p><br/><p>The hearts of the Imperial soldiers filled despair, and those feelings became the most delectable \u201cfood source\u201d for the demons.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo way, why?</p><br/><p>Why, did the effect of my Regalia Dominion\u2026. my \u201cSovereign Rule\u201d disappear?</p><br/><p>Why, was Veldora defeated?!</p><br/><p>Impossible, that\u2019s just impossible!</p><br/><p>It was just a lowly Demon Lord, a puny slime!</p><br/><p>It should have become powerless, after the source of its powers, Veldora, was taken away\u2026.</p><br/><p>How, could it consume it\u2019s master, and take that power for itself!!</p><br/><p>I was this close to finally achieving victory against Guy!!</p><br/><p>To get in the way of my plans\u2026. Unforgivable, you lowly Demon Lord!!\u300d(TN: Spaghetti status: DROPPED)</p><br/><p>Emperor Rudra, was furious.</p><br/><p>He was so angry that he wasn\u2019t conscious of what was happening around him.</p><br/><p>He had been ecstatic when he saw he could finally emerge victorious against Guy in their never ending game.</p><br/><p>The moment right before victory is when one should be the most wary.</p><br/><p>The cost of forgetting this ironclad rule, and being so careless, had now come back to bite him.</p><br/><p>The ones who defended the Emperor, had no cards to play to deal with the situation at hand.</p><br/><p>Everything was happening too fast.</p><br/><p>With no means to turn the tide in the present situation, the act now moved towards the finale.</p><br/><p>Now for something off topic, but not totally unrelated.</p><br/><p>The cause of the\u300eCalamity\u300fbeing a battle between \u201cTrue Dragons\u201d would be verified by scholars in the future.</p><br/><p>But, the real cause was something else.</p><br/><p>The emergence of the sea monsters in the \u300eCalamity\u300fstricken seas, was caused by that one swing of the Veldora Sword.</p><br/><p>The Energy overflowing from that attack, pressured and pushed aside the seawater.</p><br/><p>That phenomenon lasted a fairly long amount of time, which resulted in noxious amounts of Demonic Energy settling into the depths of the ocean.</p><br/><p>Thereafter great amounts of that Energy gradually spread throughout the ocean, causing ludicrous changes to the ecosystem.</p><br/><p>Although the\u300eCalamity\u300fwas named the \u201cScorching Tempest\u201d, the massive downpour from the evaporated seawater couldn\u2019t have caused such an impact on the ecosystem.</p><br/><p>In truth, the clash between Veldora and Velgrynd couldn\u2019t have caused this much damage.</p><br/><p>Of course, the location was obviously amazingly lucky, but there was no way it was planned by the perpetrators\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The point was, the resulting aftereffects of that single attack, would be the cause of headaches for future historians; but the truth of what transpired would never be known to the world.</p><br/><p>(TN: Author\u2019s words)</p><br/><p>I was concentrating more on the material, so the revision is lacking.</p><br/><p>Deepest apologies.</p><br/><p>I hope to start that and the matter of replies from tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Replying to everyone may be impossible, but I am reading all of it.</p><br/><p>Please understand, thank you.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Rant:</p><br/><p>So this chapter looks like it will make it in time ~ gao! This is all thanks to our local God Sushi-sama~~. I\u2019m just a lazy lion who can\u2019t meet deadlines (orz), but I do consider myself lucky for all the help. That includes many of you in the comments too! I haven\u2019t updated the tl;dr section it seems. I\u2019ll try to do it soon. Though back to the point, Sushi helped me edit and finish this in time so he is more or less half the translator for this chapter. We\u2019d probably be late every week without him lol. So next chapter tomorrow, hopefully the same time as this one. Until then, see you in another chapter ~ Gao!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

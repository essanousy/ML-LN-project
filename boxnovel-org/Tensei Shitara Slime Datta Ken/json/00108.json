With indomitable spirit, he stood up over and over again, seeming like a wall that couldn\u2019t be passed.</p><br/><p>His figure left a deep impression, captivating the spectators.</p><br/><p>Oh well, Souka secretly ignored Gabil\u2019s attempts to give up no matter how many times he tried.</p><br/><p>\u300cOoootto, what did you say? What? \u201cI can still do it...... Don\u2019t underestimate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Contestant Gabil, what motivation! Such an unyielding man! He still hasn\u2019t given up~!!\u300d(Souka)</p><br/><p>No matter how you look at it he already gave up, but his luck run out when Souka became the announcer.</p><br/><p>After all, for a full hour, Ranga toyed with him[1].</p><br/><p>Since the spectators didn\u2019t know the circumstances, it seems that Gabil was remembered as an unyielding man.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t decide whether that\u2019s a good or bad thing.</p><br/><p>However, I want to say that \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s not me!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the match ended, everyone returned to their respective inn.</p><br/><p>I got up from my seat and started to walk away to invite Masayuki for a meal.</p><br/><p>\u0300\u300cPlease wait a bit. I have something I want to ask.\u300d (Unknown)</p><br/><p>There was a person who called me to halt.</p><br/><p>It was the half elf girl from before.</p><br/><p>With pale light blue silver hair and her jade eyes, she was a super bishoujo[2]. </p><br/><p>\u300cAh, so you are here! Ah!*surprised*, Rimuru-dono, it\u2019s been a long time.\u300d(Elalude)</p><br/><p>Before I could reply to the girl, a person came and greeted me while panting. Did he come running? It was Duke Elalude. </p><br/><p>\u300cAh! Duke, it\u2019s been a long time. Are you well? And, is she your acquaintance?\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>She was a person the Duke was hurriedly looking for.......</p><br/><p>Although I expected it, more or less let\u2019s listen to his word*</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! Allow me to introduce you.</p><br/><p>This is Her Majesty, the Empress of the Sorcery Dynasty of Sarion, Elmeshia Elure Sarion.</p><br/><p>Her Majesty, this is the person I told you about before, Demon Lord Rimuru-dono.\u300d (Elalude)</p><br/><p>Pretty much, she was the ruler of the country who supported me. After he introduced the empress to me, he introduces me to her.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu. I know. This one[3] is the Empress of the Sorcery Dynasty of Sarion, Elumeshia Elure Sarion.</p><br/><p>I hope we will get along well.\u300d(Elumeshia)</p><br/><p>Although she a bishoujo, she emits a solemn aura.</p><br/><p>I think she might have suppressed it before, but the person before me is without a doubt someone worthy of being called an Empress. </p><br/><p>\u300cHello, I\u2019m Rimuru, the King of Tempest. Please take care of me as well!</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019m ignorant with the etiquette of King, please pardon my rudeness.[4]\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>I introduce myself as well.</p><br/><p>Oh dear, I sounded like an upstart Outlaw.[5]</p><br/><p>I wish you would excuse me from such stiff formalities. How should I put it, since the empress came dressed as an adventurer, I want to think something like that should be fine.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, it\u2019s not a problem. Such things aren\u2019t important.</p><br/><p>What is with this country\u2019s outrageous war potential! That\u2019s the real issue!\u300d(Elumeshia)</p><br/><p>She pressed me for answers while forcefully barraging me questions.</p><br/><p>Beside her, Duke Elalude was greatly perplexed.</p><br/><p>We changed locations, and we were now talking while eating dinner.</p><br/><p>I wanted to eat with Masayuki, but I gave priority to the Empress of Sarion this time. Though it was regrettable, it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>According to the Empress.</p><br/><p>Although she was a master in magic, she was defeated by a strong devil and couldn\u2019t do a single thing about it. That devil was Dagura.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he instantly defeated countless opponents by himself. He was a surprisingly outrageous opponent.</p><br/><p>Despite this, that devil was easily[6] defeated by by a single Tempest executive.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t accept this and became indignant.</p><br/><p>By the way, the Empress in here is a homunculus[7] that she transferred her consciousness into.</p><br/><p>So, there is no need to worry about her getting hurt, although she was frustrated about her loss.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell you see, because Her Majesty was never lost before. When it comes to magic she\u2019s the best....</p><br/><p>Therefore Her Majesty, what i can say? Since it was a Demon Lord, it won\u2019t turn out as a half-assed tournament.\u300d(Elalude)</p><br/><p>Duke Elalude soothes her as if he\u2019s given up on it.</p><br/><p>She acted recklessly because there was no danger to the real body, thanks to that I think Her Majesty\u2019s selfishness was great.</p><br/><p>That night, I enjoyed conversing with Sarion\u2019s Empress, and successfully struck an agreement about future technology.</p><br/><p>Although it was just a verbal promise, it was a promise between fellow rulers. I don\u2019t think it will be broken.</p><br/><p>After successfully making a promise with the Sorcery Dynasty of Sarion, I can say that the tournament was already successful.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m pleased with the progress, and I\u2019m convinced that the relationship between our countries will become even better in the future.</p><br/><p>And then, the night grew old, as the morning of the second day of finals arrived. </p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>The second day of the Finals.</p><br/><p>The fifth match\u2026\u2026 Arnaud vs Beretta</p><br/><p>A noteworthy match</p><br/><p>Although Arnaud said that he would conceal his status as a Holy Knight and registered as Mask Knight...</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? He doesn\u2019t depend on others, right?</p><br/><p>The one who is called the strongest of holy knights that vows to protect people how could he do something like run away [8]?</p><br/><p>If he is a man, it must be a fight fair and square! Isn\u2019t that right, Arnaud-san?\u300d (Demon Announcer)</p><br/><p>Souka seems to have asked again while smiling sweetly.</p><br/><p>She ended her words with \u201cfool\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, of course. A Holy Knight wouldn\u2019t run away from any fight!!\u300d(Trapped Knight)</p><br/><p>Maybe because he was desperate, he was muttering \u201cit will be alright if I win--If I win!\u201d It seems he decided to continue without concealing his true identity.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s just like a young rabbit that has been ensnared in a trap</p><br/><p>No, I think that conversation about escaping wasn\u2019t needed right? Well, whatever...</p><br/><p>A wicked smile seems to have appeared on Souka\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Or rather, when she was still Abil\u2019s Imperial Guard, she looked like an obedient and good child, but she changed suddenly after she revealed the fact that she was a woman.</p><br/><p>Was this her original personality? Or did she receive a wicked influence from someone (Probably Souei)?</p><br/><p>Or, it might be both.</p><br/><p>She has grown into a frightening little demon.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s too late now. I must be careful so I don\u2019t end up ensnared in a trap as well. </p><br/><p>\u300cBegin!\u300d(Souka)</p><br/><p>While I was thinking about the pitiful Arnaud, the match began before I realized.</p><br/><p>Arnaud was taking a distance from Beretta, vigilantly holding his sword.</p><br/><p>As expected, it seems he won\u2019t attack carelessly.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt started right. The day to show off Beretta\u2019s strength has come right!\u300d(Annoying Fairy)</p><br/><p>I was surprised! Suddenly Ramiris came and spoke near my ear.</p><br/><p>Veldora and Milim also came along from behind.</p><br/><p>\u300cY-You guys. Weren\u2019t you all engrossed inside the Dungeon?\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300cFuhahaha, Rimuru. It was completed a while ago. You'll looking forward to it!\u300d(Milim)</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I also have an interest in the tournament. Yesterday, I performed Probability Manipulation of Investigation King Faust[9].</p><br/><p>In yesterday matches, weren\u2019t the matches concentrated with ones that had clear results?\u300d(Otaku Dragon)</p><br/><p>WHAT\u30fbDID\u30fbYOU\u30fbSAY\u30fb!?</p><br/><p>That explains why for some reason people with similarly problematic powers were fighting each other.</p><br/><p>And, did he manipulate it so that the combination he didn\u2019t have interest in would be concentrated in yesterday\u2019s match?</p><br/><p>Certainly, there are a lot of highlights[10] in today\u2019s match.</p><br/><p>The combination like\u300eArnaud vs Beretta \u300fright now and\u300eLion Mask vs Diablo\u300f, were matches that Ramiris and Milim did not want to miss.</p><br/><p>For something that he considered uninteresting, he still accurately manipulated it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s overlook it for the sake of such interesting events like this one\u201d, he will never say such generous words, huh? As expected of him.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, I don\u2019t have an interest in the outcome, but it will serve as a good reference! Kuahahahaha.\u300d (Veldora)</p><br/><p>Veldora began proudly laughing.</p><br/><p>Unlike the old him, he seems to have become interested in the matters of strengths and weaknesses. It must be the influence of Manga. </p><br/><p>Now, he seems to be researching a beautiful way to win. What a hardworking fellow.</p><br/><p>Oh well, since he is such a strong person, I didn\u2019t think that he would let his imagination run wild for such useless things.</p><br/><p>While I was surprised by the entry of Ramiris and co, the match showed a new development.</p><br/><p>Arnold\u2019s sword attacks were easily repelled by Beretta\u2019s arm. Although it continued for some time.....</p><br/><p>\u300cOotto, Contestant Arnaud\u2019s attacks cannot pass at all?</p><br/><p>Is he going easy on his opponent? But if these are serious attacks then is he unworthy to be called the strongest Holy Knight!\u300d(Souka)</p><br/><p>That brief comment was a sharp wound.</p><br/><p>But those words couldn\u2019t disturb Arnold\u2019s mind yet.</p><br/><p>\u300cHah. Every attack so far was for the sake of a plan. Look below it\u2019s feet everyone!\u300d(Arnaud)</p><br/><p>Trying to look good, Arnaud pointed below Beretta\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>There, a magic formation was drawn without anyone having become aware. </p><br/><p>At the intervals between the sword attacks, without being noticed he had been drawing the formation by scattering silver dust.</p><br/><p>He was a skillful man.</p><br/><p>However, to be able to fight with this method, it seems he wasn\u2019t a simple muscle brain.</p><br/><p>\u300cActivate! Holy Field\u30fbWeak version!\u300d(Arnaud)</p><br/><p>So Arnaud shouted after he throws the Shuriken[11] with Barrier Tag[12] attached to them in four directions.</p><br/><p>Crystals were embedded in the handle of the Shuriken. Apparently, they were charged with Magic power, so it seems to enable the invocation of the barrier in a short time span.</p><br/><p>Although he said it was weak version, to able set up Holy Field by himself..........</p><br/><p>It seems that Arnaud is a man who cannot be underestimated.</p><br/><p>However, the equipment was made by Kurobee for Arnaud to test[13], so frankly it can be said that Kurobee was his contributor........</p><br/><p>It seems that after doing various experiments with Arnaud, the two got along well with each other.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, the quality of weapons from Tempest seems to have increased as well. It\u2019s really a great thing. </p><br/><p>Normally, although it is just a weak version of the Holy Field, most people would succumb to it when confined inside.</p><br/><p>It might be that only some of the executives would be able to cancel such a barrier.</p><br/><p>Is there even a method to completely capture Benimaru and Souei?</p><br/><p>Because the ability compatibility was only to this extent, I was unable to judge its strength and weakness.</p><br/><p>And, in the current situation, the compatibility was very bad. And for Arnaud...</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s useless. Because of the ability given to me by Rimuru-sama, I don\u2019t suffer the effects of Holy Field.\u300d(Beretta)</p><br/><p>Beretta moves to counterattack against Arnaud for the first time while informing him indifferently.</p><br/><p>It can be understood that Arnaud\u2019s sword attacks were not effective because Beretta has physical attack nullification.</p><br/><p>Also its body was created using Magic Steel.</p><br/><p>Beretta\u2019s fist was clad in helical mix of Youki and Aura[14] emitted from the Unique Skill\u300eSaint-Demon Fusion[15]\u300f, then it fired that bizarre energy.</p><br/><p>The disposition was similar to \u3008Energy Combat Arts[16]\u3009Aura Blade, but the power had increased tremendously.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s also possible to shoot it at high speed.</p><br/><p>Though it seems not to have been concentrated to the level of penetration like Benimaru\u2019s, the constant touki that clad its whole body was still beautiful without any blemish.</p><br/><p>The level was different from the irregular touki that Dagura emits.</p><br/><p>The power was not just simple Youki and Aura, one blow from that fist could be considered a Finishing Move[17].</p><br/><p>Beretta who shifted over to offensive let out an attack with fearsome precision.</p><br/><p>The spectators seemed to see the match as a great one, but my eyes couldn\u2019t be deceived. </p><br/><p>Beretta hadn\u2019t shown its true power. It only fought with 30% of its power.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu! How\u2019s dat! How\u2019s about dat! My Beretta, seriously cool!\u300d(Ramiris)</p><br/><p>Ramiris flew around my surroundings, boasting with a self-satisfied look.</p><br/><p>Not enough to only show it to me, she was also boasting to Veldora and Milim.</p><br/><p>Veldora only replied,\u300cHumph, even so I am stronger!\u300dbut,</p><br/><p>\u300cFufun[18], it\u2019s okay for you to be excited now.</p><br/><p>Tomorrow my Lion Mask will dismantle your Beretta, I\u2019m sure of it!\u300d(Milim)</p><br/><p>Not wanting to lose, Milim answered back to Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Geez, is this a children\u2019s squabble?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, don\u2019t you think we should have worried about the pitiful Arnaud-san?</p><br/><p>The brutal announcer herded him into a situation where he couldn\u2019t surrender, so his situation was hopeless.</p><br/><p>Or rather, won\u2019t Arnaud\u2019s spirit[19] be broken by this?</p><br/><p>Just with this, my own assessment of him considerably increased.</p><br/><p>When the fight between Ramiris and Milim ended, the match had also ended.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was a victory for Beretta. </p><br/><p>Arnaud used a Special Move he calls \u201cMeteor Slash[20]\u201d or something like that, but the sword broke and crumbled when came in contact with Beretta\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it was natural that the sword lost its durability after striking the hunk of steel that is Beretta\u2019s body continuously.</p><br/><p>The weapon will accumulate damage little by little even if the weapon is clad with touki.</p><br/><p>Even though his sword was broken the match continued.</p><br/><p>But Arnaud conceded defeat, and so the match ended.</p><br/><p>His sword being broken was just an excuse. In reality, he wasn\u2019t able to land a single hit on Beretta.</p><br/><p>However, since the spectators didn\u2019t know about it, the skillful announcer followed up Arnaud.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnfortunately because his sword has broken, he must reluctantly surrender from the match.\u300dWith such an explanation, the spectators understood.</p><br/><p>Souka, I will treat you to a meal! So I thought with teary eyes, somehow she gave a skillful commentary. However I pretended not to know about it.</p><br/><p>Arnaud\u2019s honor was protected. That is good.</p><br/><p>Thus, the fifth match ended with Beretta\u2019s victory.</p><br/><p>I'm sorry because it's short. </p><br/><p>Well guys because various reason (Exam for some who didn't know.), I will resume translating again after October 18th. I\u2019m very sorry (NO, I\u2019m not quitting.)</p><br/><p>See you guys on next week!</p><br/><p>[1]\u3092\u3059\u308b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f: can mean: become his opponent, or alternatively become his playmate (or plaything).</p><br/><p>[2] Pretty Girl/Beauty.</p><br/><p>[3] She is using yo, an archaic first person pronoun that mainly associated with King or Emperor.

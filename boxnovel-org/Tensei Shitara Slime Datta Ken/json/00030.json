How could that be!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: That\u2019s how it always it.</p><br/><p>Clown: What do I say? How do I make him laugh? Psychiatrists are those creatures that see meaning in ink blobs! They are beyond human!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m right behind you.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Psychiatrist: So\u2026 Mr. Clown. I am pleased to see you again.

Do you know what I\u2019d do?</p><br/><p>*silence*</p><br/><p>AK: I\u2019d start a fight with a Mime.</p><br/><p>Forest Disturbance Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 30 \u2013 Envoy</p><br/><p>Gabil had easily acquired the Goblin Villages\u2019 support.</p><br/><p>Without even having to show our power, the goblins quickly surrendered themselves to me.</p><br/><p>They are a pathetic race, after all. Should they show any intention to disobey, I\u2019ll quickly force them to obey.</p><br/><p>Gabil had completely forgotten the Head\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>He had every village bring out food from their storehouses.</p><br/><p>And, for have every warrior assemble before him.</p><br/><p>The goblin warriors numbered 7,000.</p><br/><p>They were clothed in battered leather armor, and armed with stone spears.</p><br/><p>A poor fighting force, but good enough for now.</p><br/><p>Those without the will to fight have already ran away.</p><br/><p>\u300cClan chiefs! Are there any other villages around here?\u300d</p><br/><p>The chiefs exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>One nervously replied,</p><br/><p>\u300cNo\u2026 though not exactly a village, but there is a community\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that?</p><br/><p>The way they are trying to avoid the question was getting on Gabil\u2019s nerves.</p><br/><p>And when he pressed further, they began telling him a bizarre story.</p><br/><p>That there was a group of goblins hunting atop of fang wolves.</p><br/><p>However, that makes no sense, he thought. Fang wolves are powerful monsters that move in packs.</p><br/><p>Called the rulers of the plains, they\u2019ve thwarted Lizadmen\u2019s advances many times.</p><br/><p>For them to serve some lowly goblins\u2026 impossible!</p><br/><p>And moreover, they\u2019ve concluded with a truly ludicrous statement.</p><br/><p>Those goblins obeyed a slime.</p><br/><p>A slime, the lowest of monsters! What wolf, or even goblin would serve such trash?</p><br/><p>He decided to confirm their words.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s probably some trick involved, he thought. If he handled this well, he could gain control over the fang wolves.</p><br/><p>Gabil thus decided\u2026 for the sake of his grand ambition.</p><br/><p>The village was not where he was told.</p><br/><p>That had angered him, but he decided to be patient. In order to control the wolves, he probably needed to be more patient.</p><br/><p>To achieve his desire of ousting the current Head, he needed to have more self-control.</p><br/><p>Thus, for the sake of his goals, he decided to be patient.</p><br/><p>Gabil perceived only one obstacle to his plans\u2013a lack of an army.</p><br/><p>If only he could command the wolves, the other lizardmen would surely follow.</p><br/><p>And with the rulers of the plains and the rulers of the marshes under one banner, how could they even think to fear the lowly orcs!</p><br/><p>Gabil so believed, without even a hint of doubt.</p><br/><p>By expelling the orcs, they would become the true rulers of the Jura Forest. And thus, surely Gelmudo-sama would distinguish them for their service.</p><br/><p>For such a grand dream, he\u2019d wait as long as necessary.</p><br/><p>The main army he\u2019d already sent back to the Shisu lake, ordering them to be on standby.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t have much provision, they had to act quickly. Time was of essence.</p><br/><p>And after receiving reports that tracks were found, he quickly issued orders.</p><br/><p>Including himself, he selected ten elites.</p><br/><p>Mounting the Overlizards, they ran towards their objective.</p><br/><p>The wolves were nothing to fear, as although they were certainly powerful, they obeyed some lowly goblins. Probably the leftovers of a pack.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll train them myself, and have them regain their former power!\u201d So he thought.</p><br/><p>Oh, but how could he have imagined what would lay before him\u2026!</p><br/><p>His head was filled with the dream of becoming a ruler of the forest and serving Gelmudo-sama.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>To meet with the lizardmen\u2019s envoy, I proceeded to the entrance of the city.</p><br/><p>There, we had built a small cabin that the guards used to rest in.</p><br/><p>The members who attended were myself, Rigurdo, Benimaru, Hakurou, and Shion.</p><br/><p>I had asked Shion to prepare some tea, but that ended in regret.</p><br/><p>She does not understand the beauty of gentle refinement and natural simplicity. She does everything with all her strength.</p><br/><p>As if screaming, strength is everything!</p><br/><p>When cleaning, \u201cEverything must be erased\u201d she concluded, and attempted to destroy the very building. Fortunately, we were able to stop her in time and did not need to rebuild it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI sincerely beg your forgiveness!\u201d she exclaimed dejectedly, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can let our guard down around her.</p><br/><p>She\u2019ll just try to solve any problem with her strength. So I worry about letting her out of my sight.</p><br/><p>However, she was ecstatic when I let her take wait on me.</p><br/><p>I just wish she wasn\u2019t that happy about it.</p><br/><p>And as I had expected, the tea was horrible. But was that even tea\u2026?</p><br/><p>I feel like there was strange grass, looking like wakame, floating in there. In short, that was not something you\u2019d drink.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo, fearing \u201cWhat is this\u2026 explain yourself!\u201d question, timidly turned away.</p><br/><p>What a guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Benimaru, keeping his eyes closed as if his life depended on it, refused to look this way.</p><br/><p>Damn you guys\u2026</p><br/><p>And the oblivious to our trouble, waiting for praise\u2013Shion.</p><br/><p>Wait! What is there to praise?</p><br/><p>Having said my prayers, I moved to take the teacup,</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! Tea, huh! I was just getting thirsty!\u300d</p><br/><p>With those words, Gobuta who had just arrived took the cup and drank it all.</p><br/><p>*Guuuuuuuuuudo!!!*</p><br/><p>Well done! I\u2019m proud of you from the bottom of my heart!</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s face, however, twisted into a smile devoid of any positive emotion\u2026</p><br/><p>That, Gobuta did not notice\u2026 couldn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>One last *Gobu~!* escaped from his mouth before it had filled with foam. And, *Bikun bikun!* he fell to the floor convulsing.</p><br/><p>Dodged that bullet. That could\u2019ve been me right there.</p><br/><p>Her face colored in surprise, Shion slightly inclined her head.</p><br/><p>But I won\u2019t be deceived. She\u2019s forbidden from cooking from now on.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Shion. When making food or drink for people, make sure to run it by Benimaru first!\u300d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s make sure she understands.</p><br/><p>Benimaru, choking on something, stares at me in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. She\u2019s your problem now, I leave her to you!\u201d I told him with my eyes.</p><br/><p>And thus both dejectedly hang their heads.</p><br/><p>I pray there be less victims from now on.</p><br/><p>Since the alarm sounded, an hour had passed.</p><br/><p>And the envoy had finally arrived.</p><br/><p>And, with a somewhat \u2018different\u2019 attitude, a Lizardman dismounted a giant lizard.</p><br/><p>Would he be\u2026 their leader?</p><br/><p>\u300cWell done with the reception! I\u2019ll allow you to become my servants. Be honored!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is he still asleep?</p><br/><p>Somehow\u2026 I have no words to say. What the hell is this idiot saying?</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. Haven\u2019t you heard? The orc army is advancing on the forest. The only one who can save you small fry is me!\u300d</p><br/><p>So the orcs are indeed coming. I was waiting for Souei to report, so this is within expectations.</p><br/><p>I guess it would make sense to unite against them, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, right. I\u2019ve heard there is someone among you who has tamed a fang wolf. I\u2019ll make him into an officer. Bring him to me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Umm\u2026</p><br/><p>Fighting together is good. But what if our ally is an idiot?</p><br/><p>An incompetent ally is worse than a hardened foe. That much is common sense\u2026</p><br/><p>I took a quick glance at Rigurdo. His mouth was gaping open.</p><br/><p>Benimaru scratched his head, and looked at me as if saying, \u201ccan I kill this idiot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I hadn\u2019t considered his offer.</p><br/><p>We refuse. No, not about Shion\u2019s cooking\u2013their offer!</p><br/><p>Hakurou simply crossed his arms, and closed his eyes\u2026 or is he sleeping?</p><br/><p>And, Shion, who is holding me, is flexing her arms\u2026</p><br/><p>Sto.! You\u2019ll crush me!</p><br/><p>But when she noticed my panic, she loosened up a bit.</p><br/><p>Being held in the slime body certainly feels good, but it\u2019s dangerous.</p><br/><p>I let my guard down. Being hugged to death would not be funny. Seems like she can\u2019t control her strength at all.</p><br/><p>In any case, this is rather troubling. Who\u2019d have though the envoy would be an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, the one who tamed the fang wolf\u2026 or rather made him his servant would be me\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Anyways, let\u2019s continue the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300cHaaah? A lowly slime? Then summon his now. If you do, I\u2019ll believe you.\u300d</p><br/><p>How condescending!</p><br/><p>Now I\u2019m annoyed. This guy\u2026 he\u2019s completely ignoring us, going at his own pace. He\u2019s looking down on us too much.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve met many politicians and office workers before, but never before have I met someone so blatantly foolish.</p><br/><p>For such a moron, it should be fine to ignore any rules of civility.</p><br/><p>And besides, there is no benefit in making such an ally.</p><br/><p>I decided to change my approach,</p><br/><p>\u300cRanga!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! I hear and obey.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ranga appears from within my shadow. Recently, lurking around in there has become his habit.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh. It seems I have business with you. I permit you to speak.\u300d</p><br/><p>I prefer to leave this things to others.</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s always someone who can better manage such people.</p><br/><p>But really, the only one who didn\u2019t treat me \u2013 while a slime \u2013 as trash was Rigurdo, huh.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s nothing I can do about losing interest in humoring this guy.</p><br/><p>And by the way, it seems that for every person that recognizes my aura while I hide it there is an idiot who doesn\u2019t even while I display it.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s something I need to think about.</p><br/><p>Noticing my displeasure, Ranga</p><br/><p>\u300cRather than with my lord, I have been ordered to speak with thou. I\u2019m listening. Speak!\u300d</p><br/><p>While intimidating the lizardmen, he confronted the envoy.</p><br/><p>Who, in turn, lost his composure for a second, but then quickly regained it.</p><br/><p>\u300cRi\u2026 right. So you are the Fang Wolf? The chief here? I am the Lizardmen\u2019s raid leader Gabil.</p><br/><p>Pleased to make your acquaintance. As I have just stated, I have received a name. So rather than that slime, how about serving me?\u300d</p><br/><p>He brazenly replied.</p><br/><p>Let me hit him!</p><br/><p>No, no, have to act like the mature monster here. Let\u2019s forgive him.</p><br/><p>I am an adult. Calm yourself.</p><br/><p>But more than myself, I want Shion to relax. Wait, any more power and I\u2019ll..!</p><br/><p>Noticing my squirming, Shion apologized by patting me. Seriously, calm down.</p><br/><p>However, isn\u2019t he too arrogant for a simple lizard\u2026</p><br/><p>Ranga too is begging to let him loose.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuruu. Lowly lizard\u2026 I am no longer a Fang Wolf. For you to not recognize that much, insignificant being\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Ranga gritted his teeth and a dangerous crimson light filled his eyes. He is stilling his anger.</p><br/><p>Ranga-san\u2026 don\u2019t over do it. Will the lizard survive?</p><br/><p>Were he not a messenger, I\u2019d laugh watching him torn to pieces for his stupidity, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cVery well! I\u2019ll show you my power! Who will be my opponent?\u300d</p><br/><p>Oi oi\u2026 that\u2019s a bad joke.</p><br/><p>Please read the mood, lizard. You\u2019re the weakest one here.</p><br/><p>At most, he might be stronger than Rigurdo\u2026</p><br/><p>I mean, even Rigurdo possesses B rank strength.</p><br/><p>Being the Goblin king, he is strongest warrior among the goblins.</p><br/><p>The average for a hobgoblin is C+, but he\u2019s worlds above that.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s not counting his armaments.</p><br/><p>Sure, the lizard is a named monster and maybe strong among them, but he pales in comparison to anyone here.</p><br/><p>Where the hell is this self-confidence coming from?</p><br/><p>We exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>Who will fight him\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u300cKukuku, fine. In that case, fight with one of my storm wolves, should you defeat him, I will listen.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ranga continued the conversation.</p><br/><p>Thank goodness. We couldn\u2019t agree on who\u2019d fight him.</p><br/><p>Everyone wanted to beat the guy senseless, and had a dangerous glow in their eyes.</p><br/><p>But somehow, seeing them act like that, made me relax.</p><br/><p>And whenever someone had an outburst of anger, the rest of us seemed to calm down.</p><br/><p>For guys like this, only I seem to be able to keep my cool at all times\u2026 but whatever.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that fine? I am willing to face you, you know?</p><br/><p>Well, if you feel like making excuses when you lose, you are free to send out your subordinate!\u300d</p><br/><p>Uoooooooooo!!! Ranga howled.</p><br/><p>Damn it! Just when the anger had subsided, the lizard had to provoke us again.</p><br/><p>Ranga calmly summons a wolf.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know he had learned such a summoning skill.</p><br/><p>Moreover, a black wolf appearing thus, I must admit, looks pretty damn cool.</p><br/><p>\u300cGaruu. Shut this lizard up!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGau! (Ay!)\u300d</p><br/><p>And then, to the lizard,</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you wish to borrow my strength, first show your own. Now, begin!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ranga shouted.</p><br/><p>At the sound of his voice, the battle began.</p><br/><p>The lizard, no, Gabil readied a trident, and carefully observed the storm wolf\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>The wolf, on the other hand, stood composed.</p><br/><p>*Ton!* He kicked the ground, covering the distance to his opponent in a single leap.</p><br/><p>Surpassing Gabil\u2019s perception ability, an overwhelming speed.</p><br/><p>Completely unable to react, Gabil never knew what hit him.</p><br/><p>In a split second, he received a blow to the chest. The wolf then circled behind him, and held him by the neck \u2013 with his mouth, of course \u2013 in midair.</p><br/><p>He threw Gabil into the air once, and then smashed him to the ground.</p><br/><p>That all had happened in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Not Ranga, but some average storm wolf had completely overwhelmed the B ranking Lizardmen\u2019s raid leader Gabil.</p><br/><p>I knew Ranga had been growing stronger recently, but to think that the other wolves have developed this far\u2026</p><br/><p>As a result of the attack, Gabil\u2019s scale armor fell apart, and the lizard himself had fainted.</p><br/><p>Gabil\u2019s subordinates, who were busy encouraging him a second ago, now stood troubled.</p><br/><p>They could not understand what had happened at all.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi. The winner has been decided. The offer I refuse.</p><br/><p>If you come asking for help to fight against the orcs, I may consider it.</p><br/><p>Today, however, take that away and leave\u300d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing my words, the Lizardmen finally began leaving.</p><br/><p>And thus, the troublesome Lizardmen\u2019s envoy had finally departed.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 the orcs are still going to invade, and we do not have a solid plan yet.</p><br/><p>Moreover, we seem to have met a headache-inducing, unreliable \u201callies\u201d known as the Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>The more I thought about these things, the deeper into melancholy I fell.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

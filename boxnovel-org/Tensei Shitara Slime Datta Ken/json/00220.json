That witch had falsely accused me and made me lost my position in the council.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she killed my father and brought chaos and sorrow to this country.</p><br/><p>If you all are wise, I believe that you\u2019ll understand whose words are correct!\u300f</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right\u2015\u2015 because it was Elrick himself, the prince of this country.</p><br/><p>The figure of the leader of the Guard Knight Order, Reiner can be seen on his side.</p><br/><p>The perpetrator who murdered the king and leading the Knight Order without a doubt is Reiner, Hinata thought while letting out a sigh.</p><br/><p>He completely forestalled Hinata. He planned everything, even if she said anything right now, all of the evidence must have been destroyed.</p><br/><p>The problem above all of it is Prince Elrick is pretty popular among the population.</p><br/><p>Prince Elrick with his gentlemanly appearance is pretty popular with the women. His ability aside, he gained the people\u2019s favor due to his sociable appearance.</p><br/><p>His blunder in the council was not told to the people.</p><br/><p>As it was the royal family\u2019s disgrace, Elrick was just punished with house arrest for 1 year.</p><br/><p>Taking a consideration as he is the heir of the kingdom, the house arrest was said to be a form of re-education.</p><br/><p>Either way, Tempest has become the major power. What happens to the heir of a country is not Hinata\u2019s concern.</p><br/><p>So she thought, he didn\u2019t raise any objection to that punishment, but it seems it had backfired.</p><br/><p>His terrible and reckless actions to plan to murder his father and usurp the throne was an unexpected event for Hinata.</p><br/><p>(I never thought that he was this foolish \u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>Hinata cursed her own carelessness inside her mind. Hinata feels the naivety that can\u2019t be found in her previous self.</p><br/><p>It might be said that it\u2019s Hinata\u2019s mistake that she failed to see that Prince Elrick was this foolish and didn\u2019t execute him that time.</p><br/><p>Although there\u2019s no use in regretting it now\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be said that Holy Church\u2019s grounds is vast.</p><br/><p>But, even so, more than 1.000 citizens were taking shelter inside.</p><br/><p>The former members of the Freedom Association who lives in the vicinity of the Ingrassia Kingdom have no house in the capital.</p><br/><p>Now they were working for the committee, but as they don\u2019t belong to the country, neither land nor house can be owned by them within the kingdom.</p><br/><p>Apart from the people who stay in the building borrowed by the committee, most people lived in the city blocks around the capital.</p><br/><p>It was Hinata who chose the church as a place to accept those people.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Prince Elrick\u2019s speech was not for the people inside the cathedral.</p><br/><p>His speech is for the nearby citizens who look at the national army surrounding the church with their trembling eyes.</p><br/><p>In response to this unprecedented crisis is the answer to the question of what\u2019s happening in the kingdom for the army to move.</p><br/><p>\u300cThose bastards, to smooth over the blunder in the council, what an overbearing way\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMoreover, they killed the king and intend to charge Hinata-sama as the culprit\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>To Hinata\u2019s mutter, Nicholas calmly throws his interjections.</p><br/><p>It seemed Elrick intends to take advantage of this chaos to make all of his mistakes and crimes forgotten.</p><br/><p>The annoying thing is, Elrick as the prince of this kingdom is popular.</p><br/><p>Which one will the people believe? That\u2019s clear as day.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s because Hinata-sama can\u2019t be said to have a good reputation\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Fritz crack a joke, the Holy Knight Leader Leonard makes a small consent.</p><br/><p>The two of them are the only Holy Knights left in here.</p><br/><p>Everyone else is either dispatched to various places or assigned to the duty of defending of the Holy Capital under Arnaud, the vice-captain\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>In contrast to the capital that is a safe ground, there was no room to spare for additional war forces.</p><br/><p>Although there are dozens of apprentice soldier, many of which are boys, it\u2019s unlikely for them to be war forces.</p><br/><p>As for the adventurers, they are guarding the refugees gathering around in each country under Hinata\u2019s order.</p><br/><p>There were only 4 people among Hinata and co who can actually fight.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the opponent is a country\u2019s army.</p><br/><p>Soldiers and knights, the Ingrassia Kingdom which is a large rich country boasted of</p><br/><p>a considerable number of knights commanded by Reiner seems to have surrounded the church.</p><br/><p>Even a regular soldier is troublesome, and Hinata and co can\u2019t move carelessly since there are knights.</p><br/><p>There are two Holy Knights here, but it will be difficult to protect the citizens who have taken shelter.</p><br/><p>The refugees were just like a hostage to Hinata and co.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, what will we do? It\u2019s a matter of time before those guys break in as things are.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s just us, we can break through and escape, but we will let the citizens die.</p><br/><p>Is it impossible to protect the citizens?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf this is going to happen, it would be better if we moved to the Holy City\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it\u2019s hard over there too.</p><br/><p>The opponents over there are the angel army and Chain of Restraint Titan Army of Demon Lord Dagruel, the war seems to have intensified.</p><br/><p>A little while ago, not only the telepathy got cut off, the gate also stopped working.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m certain that there\u2019s some kind of emergency happened there.\u300d</p><br/><p>To Leonard and Nicholas\u2019s information, Hinata knits her eyebrows.</p><br/><p>In the worst case, it was planned to escape to the Holy City, but that escape path seems to have been closed.</p><br/><p>However, there probably won\u2019t be enough time to transfer everyone.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did those guys demand?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, they said to bring out Hinata-sama from a little while ago.</p><br/><p>That guy named Reiner seems wants to display his power.</p><br/><p>They said, they dislike that Hinata-sama was called as the strongest.</p><br/><p>If you want, should I be their opponent?\u300d</p><br/><p>Fritz answered Hinata\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn this crisis situation, how leisurely\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>No way, he seriously said that?</p><br/><p>Was Reiner is such a big fool to that extent?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata tries to laugh it away and stops moving.</p><br/><p>And, she timidly asked Fritz</p><br/><p>Fritz lets out a sigh and,</p><br/><p>\u300cThat \u2018No way\u2019 indeed\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>He answered while shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p>According to Fritz\u2019s explanation, it seems Reiner want to wipe out the disgrace of wetting himself due to Shuna\u2019s coercion at the council by all means.</p><br/><p>For that reason, he plans to clear his name by defeating Hinata who is called as the strongest holy knight.</p><br/><p>\u300cFool. I already don\u2019t have power as I did before. I already retired you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems to be irrelevant.</p><br/><p>For Reiner, he wants to overwhelm Hinata-sama in front of the masses to show off his strength.</p><br/><p>In this regard, I could see that his ulterior motive to harass you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Fritz reported with his full of contempt appearance.</p><br/><p>Nicholas who hears it, was enraged.</p><br/><p>\u300cHe can\u2019t be forgiven, we need to kill him. That low-life is not qualified to live!\u300d</p><br/><p>Immediately, Nicholas who might go to kill was stopped by Leonard from behind.</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease wait, Cardinal. That\u2019s what the enemy wants!\u300d</p><br/><p>Leonard said so and desperately restrained Nicholas.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s thinking about measures while waiting for Nicholas to settle down.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s not much time left.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen? If I get defeated, will the citizens survive?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI can\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>However, although he says defeat, it means death.</p><br/><p>Laying the blame for the crime of killing the king is Prince Elrick\u2019s goal.</p><br/><p>Reiner and the prince cooperated in this coup d\u2019\u00e9tat because their interests matched.</p><br/><p>Showing your defeat is\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Fritz stopped talking.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t need to be said, their plan was a stupid one, and even Hinata was able to understand that.</p><br/><p>But, there seems to be no other plan to suppress damage.</p><br/><p>At least, if she accepted the duel, the citizens would be out of harm\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She would somehow counterattack.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as she done it, Hinata won\u2019t be able to wipe the stigma that accused to her.</p><br/><p>As the witch who rebels against the country army.</p><br/><p>Right now, as long as she has a chance for excuses, it might be possible to clear her name of that false accusation.</p><br/><p>If thing goes well, there might be a possibility for evidence to be found that Prince Elrick and co were the ones who killed the king.</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t have another choice but to go out.</p><br/><p>In the meanwhile, strengthen the defense as much as possible.</p><br/><p>Put a lot layer of defense barrier, turns the cathedral as an impregnable fortress.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015After all, although it might be just a temporary peace, I\u2019ll be able to buy some time rather than doing nothing.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t expect anything though\u2026\u2026 By any chance, that something might occur\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>In this time of emergency where people should think about measures against the angel and Velda, there\u2019re people who did a really foolish action.</p><br/><p>Hinata issued her order to the three people while hiding her depressed and desperate mind.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, Hinata-sama\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Nicholas tries to stop Hinata with uneasy expression but,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t intend to die.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll struggle as far as I can to buy you all time.</p><br/><p>No matter how ungraceful I\u2019ll be, I won\u2019t give up.\u300d</p><br/><p>Leaving behind those words, Hinata begins to walk.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015To stands in front of Reiner, sacrificing her body to buy time.</p><br/><p>Nicholas and co finished putting up barriers in a rush as Hinata ordered and went outside the church.</p><br/><p>What they saw outside was too horrible.</p><br/><p>Hinata\u2019s clothes were tattered and torn, black bruises are visible.</p><br/><p>It seems she has received violent assault of punches and kicks.</p><br/><p>Her fingers also stamped on, it was obvious that they\u2019re broken.</p><br/><p>What stands out are her hands and feet.</p><br/><p>She was groveling in the ground as her tendons were cut.</p><br/><p>Not to mention holding a sword, it\u2019s unlikely that she can stand.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, there\u2019s no wound on her face, it\u2019s what made Hinata\u2019s disastrous condition stand out.</p><br/><p>\u300cHi-hinata-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>Nicholas rushes over to Hinata.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, You\u2019re unable to live up to your claims! What a cheeky bastard, it\u2019s more suitable for you to rolling on the ground!\u300d </p><br/><p>With an irritating laugh, Reiner laughs loudly.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard! Wasn\u2019t it\u2019s a fair and square one on one fight!?\u300d</p><br/><p>To Leonard\u2019s words who shouting angry, Reiner laughed to the nose.</p><br/><p>\u300cA criminal has no human rights you see. What, we\u2019re merciful.</p><br/><p>If she cried and begs for forgiveness, I\u2019d think to delay the day of the death penalty a bit.</p><br/><p>Anyway, in the meantime I\u2019ll make you show your gratitude.\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying so, Reiner grins and laughs vulgarly.</p><br/><p>\u300cI can\u2019t endure it any longer. As I excepted, here and now you bastard will\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Wait\u2026\u2026 Fritz\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 The match\u2026\u2026 is sti-still\u2026\u2026 going\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Fritz who enraged and pulling out his sword was stopped by Hinata who is dying.</p><br/><p>And then, she cast for a small recovery magic and connect the cut tendons.</p><br/><p>Hinata stands up while staggering and somehow holding her sword up.</p><br/><p>\u300cHyaahahahahaha! Do you still want to be cut? Are you a Masochist?!</p><br/><p>No matter how many times you try, you seem to not able to understand that you won\u2019t be able to win against me.</p><br/><p>Alrighty then, I shall cut you over and over again!\u300d</p><br/><p>With frenzy bloodshot eyes, Reiner shouted.</p><br/><p>Being driven by his sadistic pleasure, his reasoning starts flying.</p><br/><p>Normally, it won\u2019t be out of control but, due to pleasures of being able to trample someone who stronger than him, Reiner\u2019s mind was on the verge of abnormality.</p><br/><p>Even Reiner was aware that he was inferior to Hinata.</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019d be correct that their differences were clearly pointed at the moment of the confrontation.</p><br/><p>Even though a lot of the power of Hinata\u2019s soul has gone, the ability etched to her body was still there.</p><br/><p>Even with only her swordsmanship, it surpassed Reiner\u2019s slightly.</p><br/><p>But \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Reiner whispered, \u2018Don\u2019t resist if you don\u2019t want to be attacked by everyone all at once\u2019, in accordance with such unreasonable order, Hinata was doing exactly as she was told to do.</p><br/><p>It was just as Reiner planned.</p><br/><p>He makes sure that her face uninjured, such is his purpose to enjoy seeing her beautiful, well-featured face warped by pain.</p><br/><p>And then, after beating her up severely, he was waiting for \u2018another\u2019 fun.</p><br/><p>Just by imagining it, Reiner felt his own blood boiling and brimming with power.</p><br/><p>Absolute superiority.</p><br/><p>Even if she contacts them now, it would take time for the Holy Knights to return.</p><br/><p>Even if they stop guiding the evacuation and return, they won\u2019t be able to return so easily.</p><br/><p>Besides, if he felt such presences, he would only need to give the attack order quickly.</p><br/><p>Reiner takes along with him 4.000 soldiers of the army and 300 knights of the Guard Knight Order.</p><br/><p>There was no chance for defeat.</p><br/><p>(He! After I finish tormenting her who made a fool of me, I\u2019ll also make that woman named Shuna\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>At the time Reiner swung his sword downward while having such delusion\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u2018Shing!\u2019 such clear sound was heard, Reiner\u2019s sword was stopped.</p><br/><p>\u300cHinata nee-chan! I came to help!!\u300d</p><br/><p>It was a Hero with little light.</p><br/><p>Following behind him are four children.</p><br/><p>And\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Small whispering voices begin to be heard from the people\u2019s mouths that saw the person who appeared in front of them,</p><br/><p>\u300cHe-hero-sama\u2015\u2015?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s Hero-sama\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s Hero-sama! Hero-sama has returned!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt-it\u2019s Masayuki-sama! Masayuki-sama has returned\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!\u300d</p><br/><p>And so, it doesn\u2019t take a long time for it to be a grand chorus.</p><br/><p>\u300eMA~SAYUKI, MA~~SAYUKI!!\u300f</p><br/><p>Bathed inside the chorus, a young man stands in front of the crowd.</p><br/><p>Reiner with his bloodshot eyes glared at that person.</p><br/><p>That person stands in front of Reiner.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! That person for sure is the strongest man in Ingrassia Kingdom.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s Hero Masayuki!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Everyone had gathered in the work</p><br/><p>room.</p><br/><p>Yesterday, we had borrowed a vacant room that was meant for apprentices</p><br/><p>in order to stay the night. When we first entered the work room, there were</p><br/><p>already four people inside that were just staring at the \u201cmagic steel ingot\u201d.</p><br/><p>All the while sighing, they were turning it over and over in their hands,</p><br/><p>checking if it was real. The ingot I had handed over was only the size of a</p><br/><p>human\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>I thought it was an overly exaggerated reaction, so I asked, \u2018Is it really that</p><br/><p>rare to see?\u2019</p><br/><p>[What are you even saying?]</p><br/><p>Uncle-san (Kaijin) answered me, and followed it up with an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic ore\u201d was the raw form of \u201cmagic steel\u201d. Even in its unrefined</p><br/><p>form, \u201cmagic ore\u201d was considered to be valuable.</p><br/><p>The reasoning was very simple. Its rarity, and its versatility.</p><br/><p>There was a major element that existed in this world called \u201cmagic</p><br/><p>essence\u201d.</p><br/><p>This \u201cmagic essence\u201d that didn\u2019t exist in my original world, occupied a</p><br/><p>major role in this one.</p><br/><p>When a demon was defeated, very rarely it would drop a condensed mass</p><br/><p>of magic essence called a magic stone. This magic stone was something</p><br/><p>like a concentration of energy, which was used as fuel for an invention</p><br/><p>unique to this world: spirit engineering.</p><br/><p>This magic stone acted as a core for superior demons, and on top of being</p><br/><p>more beautiful than most precious gems, it was said to contain an</p><br/><p>unimaginable amount of energy.</p><br/><p>As such, magic stones of superior demons were used as the core for many</p><br/><p>manufactured goods. Craftsmen were said to even use these as raw</p><br/><p>materials for the accessories they created. Those items would grant</p><br/><p>various effects upon the wearer, such as an increase in abilities, or an</p><br/><p>effect that would bind the item to the user only.</p><br/><p>And between \u201cmagic ores\u201d and regular ores, there was one decisive point</p><br/><p>that set them apart. Without exception, \u201cmagic ores\u201d would only form</p><br/><p>around the vicinity of superior demons. The reason was, that when regular</p><br/><p>ores are exposed to dense concentrations of magic essence, they would</p><br/><p>slowly absorb it over a very long period of time. Only when a great</p><br/><p>amount is contained would regular ores finally undergo a change into</p><br/><p>\u201cmagic ores\u201d. It was similar to how minerals would suddenly change.</p><br/><p>Naturally, only powerful demons would be inhabiting locations with high</p><br/><p>levels of magic essence. \u201cMagic ore\u201d was hard to find in locations like the</p><br/><p>habitats of weak demons that adventurers defeated to earn pocket money.</p><br/><p>For \u201cmagic ores\u201d to form, at the very least, it needed to be a place that Branked</p><br/><p>demons or above would live in.</p><br/><p>Incidentally, this was the first time I learned some information regarding</p><br/><p>the ranking of demons.</p><br/><p>[So that\u2019s how it is! Well then, I wonder\u2026I should also be around B-rank?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.(If that\u2019s what you think, it must be true. Though you\u2019re alone in</p><br/><p>thinking that!!!)]</p><br/><p>*Everyone thinking to themselves</p><br/><p>Most likely, everyone apart from that ninny Gobuta was thinking the same</p><br/><p>thing.</p><br/><p>Well, leaving the idiot aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic ore\u201d was already such a difficult thing to obtain, but the amount of</p><br/><p>\u201cmagic steel\u201d that could be extracted from that said ore was only roughly</p><br/><p>3~5%.</p><br/><p>In other words, a lump of \u201cmagic steel\u201d the size of a fist, was worth money</p><br/><p>that was 20 times its value in weight.</p><br/><p>The way money was valued here, was almost the same as in my original</p><br/><p>world.</p><br/><p>A common way of measuring money, the gold standard system, was</p><br/><p>adopted across the nations.</p><br/><p>Well, what all this meant to me, was that the metal was much rarer than I</p><br/><p>had guessed.</p><br/><p>As expected of me! Not missing a single thing! (in the cave).</p><br/><p>By the way, I became just a little bit scared about the fact that I secretly</p><br/><p>possessed a huge amount of that \u201cmagic steel\u201d. There was no way anyone</p><br/><p>could find out but\u2026what if someone did?! Was I thinking this because I</p><br/><p>was a petty bourgeois?</p><br/><p>Anyhow, the main issue was from here on.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic steel\u201d was not simply valuable just because of its rarity.</p><br/><p>There was a true reason for its worth. That was because the metal</p><br/><p>possessed a property that had extremely good affinity with guiding magic</p><br/><p>power.</p><br/><p>It was possible to control magic essence to a certain degree using imagery</p><br/><p>in the mind.</p><br/><p>My \u300eMagic Perception\u300f was the same, and even the effects of \u300eWater</p><br/><p>Manipulation\u300f was brought about the same way. The majority of skills</p><br/><p>used by demons were based on using magic essence in such a way.</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t know much in regards to magic, I had suspected that the</p><br/><p>theory behind its use was no doubt similar.</p><br/><p>And so, what if a huge amount of magic essence was included in the raw</p><br/><p>materials of a weapon?</p><br/><p>Astonishingly, apparently it will become a \u201cweapon that grows\u201d!</p><br/><p>How romantic!!!</p><br/><p>Eh, what\u2019s it like? I want it!!!</p><br/><p>Though I managed to firmly hold my inner thoughts back, the words that</p><br/><p>almost burst from my throat still remained on the very tips of my tongue.</p><br/><p>It was a weapon that responded to the thoughts of the user, gradually</p><br/><p>altering its shape into the desired ideal form. And depending on the magic</p><br/><p>power of the user, it was even possible to freely transform its form in the</p><br/><p>midst of battle! Furthermore, due to its high affinity with magic essence, it</p><br/><p>would amplify the power of skills.</p><br/><p>In a way, when compared to normal weapons, unless there was a great</p><br/><p>difference in talent, the magic weapon would definitely bring its user</p><br/><p>victory.</p><br/><p>Perhaps\u2026though this was just my speculation of a case of pouring money</p><br/><p>and utmost use of technology\u2026if a superior demon\u2019s magic stone was</p><br/><p>inserted into a blade of pure magic steel, would it possibly become a</p><br/><p>\u201csword of fire\u201d, or \u201csword of ice\u201d?</p><br/><p>Though in my heart I was screaming, \u2018Hurry and make it already!!!\u2019, it</p><br/><p>was not good to get too excited. I felt that it could be done, so I wanted to</p><br/><p>procure a magic stone if the occasion presented itself.</p><br/><p>After a long time of explanations, Uncle-san and co were now working on</p><br/><p>the sword.</p><br/><p>For future reference, we were also observing what they did. Although that</p><br/><p>Gobuta was no doubt just sleeping\u2026.</p><br/><p>When creating a sword, there were a variety of kinds that could be made.</p><br/><p>In my heart, the strongest sword is of course, the Japanese sword.</p><br/><p>However, even among katanas\u2019 there was still all kinds of varieties. To</p><br/><p>contemplate on what kind of sword you could make, was also something</p><br/><p>quite interesting to think about.</p><br/><p>It had been 10 hours since they had begun work. A longsword that looked</p><br/><p>nothing out of the ordinary had been completed.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this? A large part of magic steel was still left unused. The</p><br/><p>remaining amount was still largely the size of a fist. It was to the extent that</p><br/><p>made me think to myself, would it be alright to use just that much for one</p><br/><p>sword?\u2026</p><br/><p>Upon asking, I was given an answer saying, \u2018If all of the magic steel was</p><br/><p>used as raw material for the sword, who knows how much money that</p><br/><p>would cost!\u2019.</p><br/><p>If you thought about it, it was natural. It was no wonder they didn\u2019t make</p><br/><p>such extravagant things like elemental swords. I now understood that it</p><br/><p>simply required too much money.</p><br/><p>Apparently, they had used magic steel as the core part, while most of the</p><br/><p>blade was made out of ordinary iron and steel. I was told that magic</p><br/><p>essence in the magic steel would seep into the iron and steel parts, then</p><br/><p>eventually become completely merged. It was said that the more it aged,</p><br/><p>the stronger it became.</p><br/><p>Another special characteristic of magic weapons was that the blade would</p><br/><p>never rust or become chipped. Curiously, I was told that the weapons had a</p><br/><p>life of their own. If it became completely broken or bent, then the magic</p><br/><p>essence would burst out and dissipate all at once.</p><br/><p>Uncle-san had explained all that to me, all the while holding up and</p><br/><p>displaying the sword he had completed.</p><br/><p>It was quite interesting to listen to.</p><br/><p>I took up the finished sword and gazed at it in my hands. (Though I had no</p><br/><p>hands.)</p><br/><p>Looking carefully, although it was of a simple design, it was perfectly</p><br/><p>straight. It could be said that there was no unnecessary part to it.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t appear to be meant for pure cutting, which was the main principle</p><br/><p>behind a Japanese sword, but still seemed capable to be used for slashing</p><br/><p>attacks.</p><br/><p>I see. The goal of this design was to use this simplicity as a base to make it</p><br/><p>easier to realize an individual\u2019s respective ideal form!</p><br/><p>Keeping that in mind, I could agree with the way it was made.</p><br/><p>Well then.</p><br/><p>As promised, Uncle-san and the others had completed a magnificent sword</p><br/><p>for me.</p><br/><p>Now it was my turn.</p><br/><p>[Alright! From here on I\u2019ll be working in secret. I\u2019m sorry, but after</p><br/><p>confirming the raw materials, I want everyone to leave the room!]</p><br/><p>Saying that, I made sure that everyone would leave the room.</p><br/><p>After all, I couldn\u2019t afford to let anyone know my manufacturing method.</p><br/><p>Mainly because it would be troublesome to explain!</p><br/><p>[All the necessary materials are assembled in this room. But will you be</p><br/><p>alright? If needed, I can help out.]</p><br/><p>[Mhm. I\u2019ll be fine! Rather than that, during the next three days, make sure</p><br/><p>not to peek in the room okay? It\u2019s a promise!?]</p><br/><p>[I got it. I\u2019ll believe in you and wait\u2026]</p><br/><p>After that, Uncle-san and the others left the room.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Gobuta also went with them\u2026</p><br/><p>There might be a need to strangle some sense into that idiot at least once\u2026</p><br/><p>Now then, today\u2019s recipe on the menu shall be, how to make \u201clongsword \u00e0</p><br/><p>la carte\u201d!</p><br/><p>The method of production was simple!</p><br/><p>The first step, was to swallow up the model product!</p><br/><p>Next, what I had to do with all these materials lined up here was\u2026to</p><br/><p>swallow them all!</p><br/><p>Chew, chew, gulp!</p><br/><p>And then, I would mix them well inside my stomach\u2026</p><br/><p>All I had to do was repeat that process 19 times over, and it would be</p><br/><p>finished~!!!</p><br/><p>Easy, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>But still, good children should never imitate this, right?</p><br/><p>And that was how I carried out my work, with my head full of silly</p><br/><p>thoughts.</p><br/><p>This was bad\u2026the time needed to copy one sword took roughly 10</p><br/><p>seconds.</p><br/><p>190 seconds\u2026a little over 3 minutes, and I had made all 19 longswords\u2026</p><br/><p>it hadn\u2019t been 5 minutes since I had driven out Uncle-san and the others.</p><br/><p>How should I put it\u2026even though I knew I could do it, the way I did it so</p><br/><p>easily made me feel a little guilty toward all of the hardworking</p><br/><p>Craftsman-sans out there\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300ePredator\u300f was seriously too cheat-like.</p><br/><p>Well, what now?</p><br/><p>Since I had told them something like, \u2018Don\u2019t peek in for three days!\u2019, was I</p><br/><p>to confine myself in here for next three days?</p><br/><p>No\u2026. As one would expect, there wouldn\u2019t be any use in pointlessly</p><br/><p>staying here.</p><br/><p>I might as well be out with it and tell them bluntly that I was done\u2026</p><br/><p>Baaaang!</p><br/><p>Loudly opening the door, I stepped outside.</p><br/><p>Kaijin-san and the three brothers were looking over in worry as they</p><br/><p>hurriedly rose to stand up.</p><br/><p>Gobuta was\u2026sleeping.</p><br/><p>You\u2026to be asleep within a mere five minutes since I was in there, what</p><br/><p>was up with you?</p><br/><p>Indeed. That was the moment I decided somewhere in my mind, I would</p><br/><p>really strangle him sometime.</p><br/><p>[Hey, what\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?]</p><br/><p>[Was the materials perhaps not enough?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Or was it that it was impossible after all?]</p><br/><p>Everyone was questioning with the same concern in their faces.</p><br/><p>[Uh, mm. No, actually\u2026you see.]</p><br/><p>All those eyes full of worry was hard to stand. I couldn\u2019t help but put on</p><br/><p>airs.</p><br/><p>Still the same as ever, I had such a bad personality. I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t be</p><br/><p>cured of this even if I died.</p><br/><p>[Just kidding~! Actually, I\u2019ve already finished it all!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026. Haa???]</p><br/><p>*Altogether</p><br/><p>They raised their shocked voices in perfect harmony.</p><br/><p>Well of course they\u2019d be surprised\u2026!</p><br/><p>[Cheers~~~!]</p><br/><p>In honor of successfully completing our work, we were drinking in a bar.</p><br/><p>We were celebrating under the pretext of having made sure the goods were</p><br/><p>safely delivered.</p><br/><p>Well, I did tell them that it wasn\u2019t a necessary thing to do\u2026But they said\u2026</p><br/><p>[Now now, there\u2019ll be plenty of pretty elder sisters there!]</p><br/><p>[Yeah yeah!!! Young pretties and mature ladies! It\u2019s just the right place for</p><br/><p>gentlemen to visit!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.!!!]</p><br/><p>*Third bro is silent.

If master Rimuru doesn\u2019t go, the party won\u2019t begin?]</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to, but there was no choice!</p><br/><p>These guys were really a handful!!!</p><br/><p>Man~, my sincere image of a refined man will go to waste~! This was</p><br/><p>really troubling!!!</p><br/><p>I was told the name of the establishment was, \u300eNight Butterfly\u300f.</p><br/><p>Would there really be butterflies?

Who was this old man?</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, our surroundings had quietened down.</p><br/><p>As if they disliked that old man, the serving girls all had a hint of dislike</p><br/><p>on their faces. But it was hard to notice unless you carefully observed</p><br/><p>them.</p><br/><p>Unusually for a dwarf, the old man was of a slender build, and rather tall.</p><br/><p>Though I say that, he was around the height of a normal human.</p><br/><p>[Hey, madam! Do you permit the entering of demons into this shop?]</p><br/><p>[N-, no, even though it\u2019s a demon, it was only a harmless looking slime</p><br/><p>so\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Huuh?

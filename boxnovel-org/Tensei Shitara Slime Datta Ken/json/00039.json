Sigh\u2026 why can\u2019t we have free housing\u2026 hey, landlord!</p><br/><p>Landlord: What? Come with the rent?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Yeah, yeah\u2026 (pig)</p><br/><p>Landlord: Hmm? Did you say something?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: I asked if you wanted to hear a joke.</p><br/><p>Landlord: Haaah\u2026 I\u2019ll raise your rent.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: We have a contract, you can\u2019t do that.</p><br/><p>Landlord: I\u2019ll just get you evicted.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: What for?</p><br/><p>Landlord: Crappy jokes.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: They are not crappy!</p><br/><p>Landlord: \u2026 Fine. Let me hear it.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: What do you call 50 landlords drowning at a bottom of a lake? \u2026 A good start.</p><br/><p>Landlord: \u2026</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Forest Disturbance Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 39 \u2013 Gears of Fate</p><br/><p>So\u2026 a guy shows up looking like a clown and shouting some stuff about ruined plans or something.</p><br/><p>I got it of course. This is all his fault. No question about it.</p><br/><p>I mean, we didn\u2019t even ask him, but he goes and confesses his crimes\u2026 is he an idiot?</p><br/><p>Acting like some big shot while looking like that. Maybe he\u2019s not dressing up like a clown.</p><br/><p>Maybe he is a clown, so I concluded.</p><br/><p>From what I gathered, he also led the Orc Lord here.</p><br/><p>The Clown\u2013Gelmudo-san seems to be very angry.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he seems to be trembling and greatly flustered, so he\u2019s very incoherent.</p><br/><p>Is he just calcium-deficient? I guess devils need vitamins.</p><br/><p>Then the clown said,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat a useless blockhead!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s all because you haven\u2019t evolved into a demon lord even after eating the lizards and the ogre trash!</p><br/><p>Making this great Gelmudo-sama come out all the way out here!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>What a horrible manner of speech.</p><br/><p>Waking to these words, Gabil called out.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Gelmudo-sama! You\u2019ve come to our rescue!\u300d</p><br/><p>Eh? This lizard\u2026 was he passed out the entire time?</p><br/><p>You\u2026 he called you orc food, you know.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh? Oh, what do you know, it\u2019s Gabil. You should\u2019ve been killed already!</p><br/><p>Whatever. Since I came out here I might as well finish the job.</p><br/><p>Rejoice! You are dying for my sake!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying thus, Gelmudo pointed his hand at Gabil.</p><br/><p>And saying, \u201cDie!\u201d, he fired a magic bullet at him.</p><br/><p>\u300cProtect Gabil-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGabil-sama is in danger!\u300d</p><br/><p>Screaming their lungs out\u2013Gabil\u2019s followers.</p><br/><p>A single magic bullet downed five lizardmen.</p><br/><p>Well, maybe because hitting five targets weakened it, or maybe they were just really tough, but none of them died.</p><br/><p>Gravely wounded, but still alive.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuys\u2026 what is the meaning of this, Gelmudo sama?!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>A panicked Gabil asks.</p><br/><p>Figure it out already, you were used! However, this isn\u2019t the right time to say it.</p><br/><p>Betrayed by his most trusted person, Gabil\u2019s face was pale despair.</p><br/><p>\u300cGa\u2026 Gabil-sama, it\u2019s dangerous here\u2026 please run away\u2026!\u300d</p><br/><p>Even when on verge of death his subordinates worry about him. What great subordinates he has.</p><br/><p>Soldiers that a commander yearns for\u2026 something like that?</p><br/><p>\u300cLowly lizards! If you want to die that much, I\u2019ll gladly kill you all!</p><br/><p>And have the Orc Lord devour your bodies!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>While saying that, I felt him gathering a larger magic bullet in his hand.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t magic, right? I didn\u2019t hear an incantation. Feels more like he gathers magic in one spot.</p><br/><p>Hmph.</p><br/><p>I walked ahead, right in front of the lizardmen.</p><br/><p>Right in front of the scared and trembling Gabil.</p><br/><p>My expression hidden by the mask.</p><br/><p>I wonder how I look to Gabil? A passing thought.</p><br/><p>Why did I walk over here?</p><br/><p>Gabil caught my interest. So I\u2019ll save him. That was the only reason.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s all the reason I need. I\u2019ve chosen to live as I please.</p><br/><p>I live free!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the kind of \u201cme\u201d that I want to show Gabil.</p><br/><p>However, he looks completely lost. Maybe all the new information overloaded his brain?</p><br/><p>But don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not like I want him to say anything.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m just pissed at the clown.</p><br/><p>Gelmudo, however, completely ignored me and fired the magic bullet.</p><br/><p>\u300cFuhahahaha! I\u2019ll show you the power of a high class devil!</p><br/><p>Die! Shisha no Koushinenbu!!! (Death March Dance)\u300d</p><br/><p>A large magic bullet, split in mid air, and as if drawing a circle flew at us.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it won\u2019t be passing me.</p><br/><p>In my child form, I lift my small hand as if to grab it.</p><br/><p>And with just that, the magic bullet is absorbed into it.</p><br/><p>I was immediately able to analyze it. It was a simple magic manipulation skill.</p><br/><p>With low energy cost, it\u2019s easy to change the output. Well, as long as the caster is within range.</p><br/><p>If he went all out to fire this round, then he\u2019s no threat to me.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s make sure,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, did you really intend to kill me with this boring skill? To test your words, could you please show me how to die? \u300d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I fired off a magic bullet.</p><br/><p>If I wanted to, I could also split it like he had, but I see no need. Putting in more magic energy, I make it the size of a fist.</p><br/><p>That got me thinking. The one he had fired was the size of a head, so was probably denser and more potent.</p><br/><p>If I use the same magic theory with the fire bullet, I should be able to increase its strength even further.</p><br/><p>How fun!</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not forget that the clown looks pretty tough, so he makes a great target.</p><br/><p>And if I bore of this, I can just eat him.</p><br/><p>I further accelerated the bullet and it made contact with the clown. And the moment it did, I released the magic energy.</p><br/><p>Gelmudo was sent flying.</p><br/><p>He had meant to evade, but couldn\u2019t due to the sudden acceleration.</p><br/><p>Rolling over, he desperately started to regenerate his wounds.</p><br/><p>Heeeh. He\u2019s got a regeneration skill. Isn\u2019t that wonderful! I bet he tastes great.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s enjoy (eating) my first devil.</p><br/><p>As if understanding my intentions, Benimaru and Ranga are standing pleased, but on guard.</p><br/><p>And Shion, despondent due to not being able to go all out\u2026 nope, that\u2019s not how she looked.</p><br/><p>Rather, her eyes were sparking in delight watching my fight.</p><br/><p>No idea how she\u2019ll be venting all the pent up later though, but it should be fine.</p><br/><p>I leisurely walk right up to Gelmudo \u2013 who was still rolling on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cJust get up already. Weren\u2019t you going to show me the power of a high class devil?\u300d</p><br/><p>I kicked the collapsed Gelmudo.</p><br/><p>Seems like it was more powerful than I thought, since he was blown away again.</p><br/><p>What a brittle guy.</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yo-you! How dare you! To a high\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Kicking the ground, I immediately appear right in front of Gelmudo.</p><br/><p>Aiming at his solar plexus, I throw some punches. Punches that are reinforced with armor.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t feel pain of the impact of course, but as my punch drives further and further into his flesh, Gelmudo\u2019s face distorted in anguish.</p><br/><p>Without care, I continue punching the guy.</p><br/><p>And once again, I fire off a magic bullet.</p><br/><p>Though I can regulate its strength, I was able to figure out that the bullet does five times more damage than one punch.</p><br/><p>Unless I start infusing my punches with energy, of course. If I do, my punches also become quite lethal, and energy consumption grows.</p><br/><p>However, as the bullet uses less energy, it is a more efficient weapon.</p><br/><p>Seems like I can fight barehanded like a certain warrior race. Not that I will.</p><br/><p>But anyways, this guy is clearly above an A rank, but still way weaker than Benimaru.</p><br/><p>I wonder why?</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. It is based on ranking system as defined by humans that focuses on the amount of energy in circulation.</p><br/><p>However, even if those with the same amount of energy battle, the one who is able to utilize it more efficiently shall have the advantage.</p><br/><p>Moreover, since skill level is not included in the ranking, great difference of strength tend to occur among those of the same rank\u226b</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s how it was.</p><br/><p>Level is not something I can just figure out by looking. Since this isn\u2019t a game, if I don\u2019t fight them, I wouldn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s why Hakurou, who\u2019s skill level was surely high, had obtained that powerful body.</p><br/><p>Even if you possess a lot of energy, it\u2019s meaningless if you can\u2019t use it.</p><br/><p>So right now, I know I cannot possibly lose against either Gelmudo or the Orc Lord.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, can\u2019t you put on a good show? Or is that clown appearance just for laughs?\u300d</p><br/><p>What kind of skills does he have?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t feel any threat from him. Rather, it\u2019s like I\u2019m asking a shopkeeper to show me his wares.</p><br/><p>\u300cWh-wha-whaaat\u2026 you! Y-y-y-youuuu!!! Such words, to a high ranking devil, such\u2026 you\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I hit him.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t this guy properly respond when asked?</p><br/><p>\u300cSto-stop! Please stop! I\u2019m backed by the Demon Lords! For you to do such a thing!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Seems like he\u2019s saying something.</p><br/><p>How annoying. Is he thinking that he\u2019ll be able to cry about this to his patrons?</p><br/><p>And\u2026 demon lord Leon is, well, my prey.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd? How are you planning on going back to cry to them? You aren\u2019t thinking that I\u2019ll let you live, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing my question, Gelmudo pales and he begins to tremble in fear.</p><br/><p>That kind of response was surprisingly amusing. As expected of a clown.</p><br/><p>Gelmudo then used some kind of spell and flew into the air. Seems like he\u2019s trying to escape.</p><br/><p>But, all I could think of looking at that was: that magic looks delicious!</p><br/><p>I could fly with by sprouting wings, but not at supersonic speeds. This guy, on the other hand was pretty fast. I want it.</p><br/><p>And it\u2019s not like I was planning on letting him go.</p><br/><p>I shot him down with a fire bullet.</p><br/><p>Well, even if it hadn\u2019t hit, I had already tied some sticky thread around his foot.</p><br/><p>Gelmudo fell crashing into the ground. He was so flustered that he didn\u2019t even put up a guard.</p><br/><p>Though I like those that yearn for subordinates, I hate the opposite type of personality.</p><br/><p>Especially those who\u2019d take advantage of and discard people\u2013for them I show no mercy. But since he possesses various abilities, let\u2019s at least munch on him a bit.</p><br/><p>When I approach,</p><br/><p>\u300cKieeeeeeeeeee!!! Stay away! You\u2019re finished! The demon lords won\u2019t forgive you!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He blurted out while trying to crawl away.</p><br/><p>Demon lords, huh. Seems like he knows a lot, and I\u2019d certainly want to question him, but there\u2019s a chance of him running away.</p><br/><p>Probably need to interrogate him before he has a chance to.</p><br/><p>Even if I eat him, I won\u2019t get his knowledge. I can only get my hands on his skills. Though that\u2019s also a bit random.</p><br/><p>Though I can acquire the skills, there being too few of them is one of the flaws (if I can call it that).</p><br/><p>I approach silently.</p><br/><p>In utter terror, Gelmudo shoots magic bullets at me while crawling away. Not that they have any effect.</p><br/><p>I repel them all with my barrier.</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t have enough power to break through my barrier. That much we already established.</p><br/><p>After finally figuring it out, he stood up and tried to run away.</p><br/><p>The Orc Lord stands there, does he plan to ask for help?</p><br/><p>Whatever. I\u2019ll let him do that.</p><br/><p>In any case, I had planned to exterminate the Orc Lord later. If they both come at once, it save me some trouble.</p><br/><p>I can easily beat them alone, but this is all so tiring.</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t mind if the orc lord peacefully capitulates; I don\u2019t hate him.</p><br/><p>The easier this ends the happier I\u2019ll be.</p><br/><p>Though I do worry that orc soldiers will then be running around causing trouble in the forest.</p><br/><p>While thinking these things, I let him distance himself from me.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou blockhead! Don\u2019t just stand there doing nothing! Save me!</p><br/><p>Hyahahaha! I don\u2019t know who the hell you are, but you must be able to see this orc\u2019s power! Go, Orc Lord! Make the idiot who dared strike me regret\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>*Doshun!*</p><br/><p>A head rolled.</p><br/><p>*Baki, baribori\u2026*</p><br/><p>Gelmudo\u2019s body was cut up into a thousand pieces.</p><br/><p>*Guchaguchaboriboriguchabaki*</p><br/><p>Ueh\u2026 He\u2019s being eaten.</p><br/><p>The Orc Lord, to whom Gelmudo ran with the intention of intimidating me, had lopped off his head with a butcher knife.</p><br/><p>And ripping his body up, he began eating him.</p><br/><p>What to say\u2026 he really died like a small fry.</p><br/><p>And besides, the Orc had also been aiming to eat him? Or was it by instinct?</p><br/><p>Whichever is the case, this has gotten rather troublesome.</p><br/><p>His eyes glowing a pale light, he seems to have become intelligent.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Orc Lord, who had been moving on instinct alone, finally acquired self-awareness.</p><br/><p>And released an aura that could not be compared with his past self.</p><br/><p>\u226aConfirmed. The Orc Lord\u2019s magical energy has greatly increased.</p><br/><p>Evolving into a demon lord \u2026 success.</p><br/><p>Individual: Orc Lord has evolved into Demon Lord Orc Disaster\u226b</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t ask about that! I can do without an explanation.</p><br/><p>Seriously, cut me some slack.</p><br/><p>Without a care for my thoughts,</p><br/><p>\u300cFuhaaaaa!I am the Demon Lord Orc Disaster. The Devourer of the World.</p><br/><p>Call me, Demon Lord Gelmudo!!! Honor given to my first prey!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>See.</p><br/><p>Just cause I got carried away a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s why I should have just killed him already!\u201d I cursed. \u2026 well, it\u2019s too late now.</p><br/><p>Just like some alien with an M-shape bald spot, getting carried away and losing. Letting the enemy increase their power only to lose afterwards. Pathetic.</p><br/><p>I always made fun of him when I read that, but now that I did it myself\u2026</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s remember from now on. Kill them when you can. A golden rule.</p><br/><p>That aside\u2026</p><br/><p>What should I do about him? Thinking that, I got a little depressed.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>The Demon lords silently observed the scene.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow fun!\u300d</p><br/><p>The girl muttered.</p><br/><p>Gelmudo hadn\u2019t noticed it, but the Girl had already made use of his eyes.</p><br/><p>The moment he looked over at her.</p><br/><p>After Gelmudo had left, she had his sight projected unto a water sphere she created\u2026</p><br/><p>And as expected, Gelmudo wanted to cheat by intervening in the conflict.</p><br/><p>That much earned him death, but the demon lords had not expected a human to do it.</p><br/><p>A human child wearing a beautiful mask.</p><br/><p>Moreover, since they were following Gelmudo\u2019s vision, they didn\u2019t see the surrounding group.</p><br/><p>The flustered and irrational Gelmudo had not noticed the large gathering of high class monsters.</p><br/><p>The oni race. Once every few hundred years an elderly ogre could evolve into one.</p><br/><p>Their ability unnaturally high, they are often said to be capable of crushing the heavens. And three of such oni were present.</p><br/><p>Had he noticed, he would know that they weren\u2019t someone he could handle.</p><br/><p>And a fang wolf that evolved strangely was also present. Judging from his appearance alone, he was at least an A rank monster.</p><br/><p>Thus, four rank A+ monsters were present. And they obeyed a single child?</p><br/><p>A child wearing a beautiful mask. Certainly not a normal person. Probably a monster that took on the appearance of a human.</p><br/><p>If not that, then a new \u201chero\u201d had been born among the humans.</p><br/><p>Those summoned or \u201cWorld Travelers\u201d were certainly strong, but none so as a child.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because their souls have not yet developed so they can\u2019t properly put their skills to use.</p><br/><p>By a process of elimination, they demon lords figured out the correct answer.</p><br/><p>A mimicking monster!</p><br/><p>One capable of easily overpowering the A rank high class devil Gelmudo.</p><br/><p>And four high ranking monsters serving him.</p><br/><p>Power that they couldn\u2019t ignore.</p><br/><p>\u300cWho would\u2019ve thought that that Gelmudo would put on such a good show!\u300d</p><br/><p>The girl exclaimed happily.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously\u2026 That monster, should we crush it? Or raise it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo getting a head start. Though negotiating to make it a servant is allowed!\u300d</p><br/><p>The demon lords thought.</p><br/><p>If they could acquire that as their servant, they could surpass the other demon lords.</p><br/><p>However, they also needed to consider the chance of it becoming a threat.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, about this, can we keep it a secret among the four of us? Since we finally got something to kill our boredom with!\u300d</p><br/><p>The real purpose was, of course, to gain a trump card against the absent demon lords. That\u2019s how highly they valued that monster.</p><br/><p>Should that monster selfishly proclaim themselves as a demon lord, they are sure to immediately lose interest and eliminate it.</p><br/><p>However, that time has yet to come.</p><br/><p>The four nodded, and thus formed a new coalition.</p><br/><p>Had the demon lords moved at this time, then Rimuru\u2019s fate would be very different.</p><br/><p>However, the demon lords did not move.</p><br/><p>That decision moved the gears of fate.</p><br/><p>And, pushed this story onto an unalterable route.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The order to kill was the only thing left in her mind because of Ultimate Dominion</p><br/><p>For Velzard to still be able to retain her ego was proof that she had a strong spirit.</p><br/><p>However, even with such a strong spirit\u2015\u2015 Velzard couldn\u2019t defy the order of Ultimate Dominion.</p><br/><p>After a momentary hesitation, Velzard unleashed blades of envy towards Velgrind.</p><br/><p> \u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Velgrind had realized quickly that she could fight her older sister Velzard on more than equal terms thanks to\u300eFlame God Sovereign Cthugha\u300f\u2018s peerless ability which had evolved to overcome the control over herself.</p><br/><p>After all, since she lost in terms of energy, if she just had an equal ability like before, it was clear her defeat was a matter of time.</p><br/><p>Even now she was still inferior in energy levels, but she could fight her sister equally in terms of energy efficiency. It was a very surprising evolution.</p><br/><p>And even about the energy\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(What is this connection\u2015\u2015 \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d? As long as I wish for it, an unknown energy will flow into me\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Yes, through the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d that had been constructed between her and Rimuru, it was possible for her to replenish her energy.</p><br/><p>Actually, Velgrind had lost the majority of her magic essence in \u201cAlteration\u201d into \u300eFlame God Sovereign Cthugha\u300fand its Ignition[1], but right after that, energy flowed into her from the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d, so her energy was almost completely recovered.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t think that she could lose,</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel I won\u2019t lose\u201d, that was Velgrind\u2019s honest thoughts.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, Velgrind noticed that her older sister\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>(Is it coming!?)</p><br/><p>Velgrind put herself on guard.</p><br/><p>It seems her intuition was right. Velzard\u2019s trump card was activated and sent towards Velgrind.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhiteout Absorb[2]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>A strike filled with everything Velzard has got.</p><br/><p>It was Velzard\u2019s strongest attack which combined her own ability\u300eCessation Lost[3]\u300fand\u300ePatience Lord Gabriel\u300f\u2019s ability\u300eSolidification[4]\u300fwith also\u300eEnvious Lord Leviathan\u300f\u2019s ability\u300eAbsorb[5]\u300f.</p><br/><p>With the attack coming towards her, Velgrind accelerated her own energy to the maximum in order to oppose it.</p><br/><p>\u300cCardinal Acceleration!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Two polar lights, white and red collided.</p><br/><p>The northern land experienced a severe earthquake, as the falling ice and snow repeatedly sublimated and froze with a death blizzard raging on.</p><br/><p>The victor was Velzard.</p><br/><p>Due to her new ability\u300eEnvious Lord Leviathan\u300f, she had downgraded Velgrind\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Velzard\u2019s energy which should have been exhausted had recovered for some reason.</p><br/><p>The essence of\u300eEnvious Lord Leviathan\u300f was to degrade her opponent to below her level.</p><br/><p>Besides that, it also had the effect of absorbing the opponent\u2019s energy\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In addition to her absolute defense power and overwhelming Velgrind in terms of maximum energy, Velzard possessed energy absorption too.</p><br/><p>Now that her abilities had been downgraded, it seemed impossible for Velgrind to win.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s the end, Velgrind. I shall praise you for growing stronger to be able to oppose me. However, the result won\u2019t change. You aren\u2019t a threat for me when I got serious. Now, I have downgraded your abilities by one level. It\u2019s impossible for you to have an advantage against me anymore.\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. For Velzard, Velgrind wasn\u2019t a threat even if she was an obstacle.</p><br/><p>Because of the opposition of their abilities, it would be impossible for Velgrind to break through Velzard\u2019s defense.</p><br/><p>However\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, Nee-san. I don\u2019t need to defeat you. Besides, even if my abilities are downgraded, the original acceleration ability has not been affected in any way. Since the abilities only support me, it will not affect me even if I lost them!\u300d</p><br/><p>Velgrind fearlessly declared.</p><br/><p>In fact, Velgrind\u2019s abilities were focused on only one thing, that was\u300eAcceleration\u300f.</p><br/><p>Now that she had already circulated her energy with full power, it wouldn\u2019t affect her even if\u300eFlame God Sovereign Cthugha\u300fwas sealed off.</p><br/><p>And the most important thing was\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Hurry up, Guy. Be quick and release Nee-san from their control!)</p><br/><p>Velgrind didn\u2019t have to defeat Velzard at all.</p><br/><p>Velgrind\u2019s victory condition was to earn time until Guy releases Velzard from Ultimate Dominion.</p><br/><p>At that time, in Velzard's inner world[6], Guy was about to finish the final touches</p><br/><p> \u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Passing through multiple mental walls, Guy dove into the abyss of the heart.</p><br/><p>If he lost his focus, his ego would be swallowed up by Velzard\u2019s soul and the Spiritual Dive would be broken.</p><br/><p>Then, Guy\u2019s consciousness would disappear.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, if he pushed forward forcibly with all of his strength, he would destroy Velzard\u2019s heart. If that happened, the result would be Velzard releasing all her energy after a rampage and a new \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d would be born somewhere in this world.</p><br/><p>Guy had to avoid that from happening.</p><br/><p>Despite being under pressure, Guy passed through the walls without being impatient.</p><br/><p>Finally, he found it.</p><br/><p>It was a young spirit of Velzard sitting hugging her knees.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, I\u2019ve been looking for you, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy talked naturally and calmly.</p><br/><p>This was a critical moment. A single mistake would change Velzard\u2019s action for the worse.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it? What did you come here for? Are you here to laugh at me?\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzard asked while acting the way she appeared..</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I came to pick you up. Let\u2019s go back quickly, Velzard.\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy shrugged his shoulders and answered.</p><br/><p>His reply irritated Velzard.</p><br/><p>It was always the same.</p><br/><p>Guy always spoke one-sidedly and arrogantly only to Velzard.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even care about Velzard and said things bluntly as if it was natural for him to do so.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is with you! Guy, you never listen to my opinion. It\u2019s always, always me who had to be patient! As the Tuner, I had the role to guide this world that my older brother left behind. That\u2019s why I always observed you so that you wouldn\u2019t go on a rampage. Even though I really hated it\u2026\u2026 Even Velgrind went freely to the place of the man she loved and Veldora was so carefree and rampaged as he pleased. As for me, I endured it all the time, you know!? Everything was because you were acknowledged by my older brother! It was because you were the only being except for my older brother who could destroy this world. I couldn\u2019t afford to leave your side, you know\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m the only one who needed to have patience\u2026\u2026 And yet, you\u2019re going to leave me behind. I will never forgive you for that. Why do you have to support that suspicious slime now!? It would have been fine if you lived quietly in this northern land! You oppose my older brother even though there\u2019s no way for you to win. Rather than letting you be killed by my older brother, I would rather be the one who will kill you with my own hands!\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy\u2019s words sparked a fire inside Velzard\u2019s frozen heart.</p><br/><p>As she raged, Velzard threw out all of her displeasure she felt until now.</p><br/><p>With all of her feelings, she lashed out at Guy with her fierce will.</p><br/><p>They became imaginary blades which cut at Guy\u2019s body, but Guy didn\u2019t try to avoid the attack.</p><br/><p>He just stood there being exposed to the attacks without resistance as if he tried to accept all of Velzard\u2019s anger and complaints.</p><br/><p>\u300cBesides\u2026... You even acknowledged a human but you never acknowledged me\u2026\u2026 What am I to you!? Even though I always tried my best, because I wanted to be acknowledged by you\u2026\u2026 There\u2019s no place for me at all!\u300d</p><br/><p>Her attacks gradually became weak, and eventually, Velzard started to hit Guy\u2019s chest feebly.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you an idiot? I acknowledged you, you know? My partner is only you alone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m an idiot, you said!? I don\u2019t want to be called that by you who will always do whatever as you please!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI guess nothing can be done about it. If you don\u2019t like it, can\u2019t you just say it? You are too concerned about boring things, you know. Also, I lost to Veldanava a long time ago, okay? I\u2019ll win next time!\u300d</p><br/><p>Before she realized it, Velzard had stopped hitting Guy.</p><br/><p>Then, she buried her face in Guy\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026You are the idiotic one. There\u2019s no way you can win\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt might be impossible for me alone. So please cooperate with me. You will fight together with me, right? Right, Velzard?\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzard was speechless.</p><br/><p>Guy\u2019s arrogance was too much.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015And, towards that very Guy-like words,</p><br/><p>\u300cI hate you. I really, really, really, really, really hate you. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you\u2015\u2015 I hate you so much that I love you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzard confessed with her whole heart.</p><br/><p>Guy\u2019s response to that was very simple\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I knew.\u300d</p><br/><p>So, a simple word as if he said something unimportant.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo arrogant, you are really an unpleasant\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight? That is proof that I\u2019m me after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, this makes me looks like an idiot for worrying all by myself\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. I also think so, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026Shouldn\u2019t this be the part where you deny it and console me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy? That\u2019s bothersome. Never mind that, quickly cut off the control. If you don\u2019t hurry up, I don\u2019t think even Velgrind will last long.\u300d</p><br/><p>In fact, if the fight was prolonged, Velgrind would have been at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>If the energy supply from the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d between her and Rimuru ceased, Velgrind\u2019s defeat would become a certainty.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re unkind as usual towards me\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, really? You\u2019re my partner after all. I don\u2019t have to be considerate with you cause we\u2019re like a family, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPartner\u2026\u2026 Family\u2026\u2026 Family!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzard\u2019s face, which was buried in Guy\u2019s chest, turned red instantly.</p><br/><p>In panic, Velzard jumped away from Guy.</p><br/><p>Guy remained calm and didn\u2019t notice Velzard\u2019s unrest.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u300d</p><br/><p>He said so without minding Velzard\u2019s feelings.</p><br/><p>Although Velzard thought that Guy\u2019s attitude was a bit disappointing, she was relieved that Guy responded to her as usual.</p><br/><p>There was already no hesitation in her heart and light of a strong will returned to her eyes.</p><br/><p>She then focused her mind in order to resist Ultimate Dominion that had been cast on her.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood, I\u2019ve also steeled myself. But, it won\u2019t be easy to cut off my brother\u2019s control\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s a way. It seems that the\u300eControl\u300fhad been established using angel series\u2019 skill as the key and lock[7]. Then, if you neutralize it with a demon series\u2019 skill, you can erase that lock. If you do so, no matter how powerful his control is, you can resist it.\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy answered without hesitation.</p><br/><p>In his words, there was a powerful confidence that Velzard could do it.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou make it sound so easy. Fine, I shall meet your expectations.\u300d</p><br/><p>And so, Velzard overcame her own hesitation and confronted her brother\u2019s curse deep inside her consciousness.</p><br/><p>In response to the change of Velzard\u2019s mind, the Ultimate Skills etched in her soul began to fight each other for domination of her soul.</p><br/><p>As Velzard\u2019s will dictated,\u300eEnvious Lord Leviathan\u300fbit off\u300ePatience Lord Gabriel\u300f. However\u300ePatience Lord Gabriel\u300fstubbornly resisted and tried to protect the lock of the control with its strong defensive power.</p><br/><p>The fight in Velzard\u2019s inner world seemed to fall into a stalemate, but Guy wouldn\u2019t allow that.</p><br/><p>\u300cVelzard, I\u2019ll help you just a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy said so and activated his imitation of the unbelievable ability he saw just a while ago.</p><br/><p>It was \u201cAlteration\u201d, which helped Velgrind overcome the control and evolve her skill.</p><br/><p>\u300aQuestion. Will you synthesize Ultimate Skill\u300ePatience Lord Gabriel\u300fwith\u300eEnvious Lord Leviathan\u300fand activate \u201cAlteration\u201d? YES/NO\u300b</p><br/><p>The \u201cVoice of the World\u201d echoed inside Velzard\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>(Is this what Guy means as help!? But, let\u2019s believe in him for this.)</p><br/><p>Velzard answered YES without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u300aConfirmed. Individual: \u201cIce Dragon Velzard\u2019s Ultimate Skill\u300ePatience Lord Gabriel\u300fand\u300eEnvious Lord Leviathan\u300fare synthesized and evolved into Ultimate Skill\u300eIce God Sovereign Cthulhu[8]\u300f.\u300b</p><br/><p>At the same moment that the voice echoed inside her inner world, the lock binding Velzard\u2019s heart crumbled and disappeared.</p><br/><p>The lock of the heart that she could never break no matter how desperate she tried to resist it until now had been smashed to pieces easily as if it was glass.</p><br/><p>Velzard and her skills had united splendidly and beautifully.</p><br/><p>(This is the mental state that Velgrind reached!? And\u2015\u2015the strength Guy had given to me. If I have this ability, there will be no one who could bind me down.)</p><br/><p>And so, Velzard received it as a matter of course.</p><br/><p>If she and Guy banded together, they would have no opponents in this world.</p><br/><p>\u300cSee, it was simple, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy\u2019s voice, that was so arrogant to the extent of loathsome, echoed in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, it was\u2026\u2026 I really look like an idiot\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou think so? But I don\u2019t hate it, you know? It\u2019s a part of you too.\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzard laughed a bit due to Guy\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The young Velzard was nowhere to be seen now.</p><br/><p>She returned to her original ladylike appearance, beautiful and graceful.</p><br/><p>With a bashful smile that could charmed everyone, she quietly muttered\u300cI\u2019m home.[9]\u300dto Guy.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Guy\u2019s consciousness instantly returned to his body.</p><br/><p>A bit of impatience could be seen in his expression.</p><br/><p>He was the one who did it, but he was astonished by Velzard\u2019s rapid changes due to \u201cAlteration\u201d.</p><br/><p>(Rather, what exactly is that? That wasn\u2019t on the level of ability modification. Moreover, the only thing I did was activate it, I actually got the impression that something else had done it as a proxy\u2026\u2026 As if it had anticipated that I would do so\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>To Guy who seemed that he was about to drift into his sea of deep thoughts,</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re back? What happened to my older sister?\u300d</p><br/><p>He heard Velgrind\u2019s voice asking him.</p><br/><p>\u300cAhh, the control was released safely. She will wake up soon.\u300d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Guy answered, Velzard woke up.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have caused some trouble for you, Guy. And, Velgrind, I have shown you my unsightly side and I apologize for insulting Rudra.\u300d</p><br/><p>She said so and lowered her head towards Guy and Velgrind.</p><br/><p>\u300cFor Ane-sama to apologize to me, I must have gone crazy. But, I\u2019m so glad. It would be impossible for me to tolerate that Nee-san was being controlled by someone after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems I have made you worry. But putting aside whether Velda is Nii-san or not, it\u2019s true that his strength is comparable to Nii-san, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHumph. Even if it is so, if he\u2019s not Nii-san\u2015\u2015 No, even if he was Nii-san, I won\u2019t change my mind that I have to defeat Velda. Velda is Rudra\u2019s enemy after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re so straightforward, heh, Velgrind\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m a bit jealous.\u300d</p><br/><p>The sisters threw a straight gaze at each other and confirmed each other intention.</p><br/><p>Guy called out the two people with\u300cNever mind that, let\u2019s end this quickly.\u300d.</p><br/><p>Guy had already returned to his combat form while the two were talking.</p><br/><p>And the three of them turned their sight on the girl, who was Veldora\u2019s opponent.</p><br/><p>The Hero Chloe\u2015\u2015 No, towards Manas: Lucia who had taken over her body.</p><br/><p>However\u2015\u2015simultaneously with her blade flashed, Chloe\u2019s body split into two.</p><br/><p>No, that was just an illusion.</p><br/><p>The blade of will released from inside Chloe had interfered with the real world which is why such an image was shown to those in this place.</p><br/><p>Veldora had been cut here and there, but he had not received a fatal injury.</p><br/><p>The two sisters were relieved to see that.</p><br/><p>Guy had his eyes glued towards Chloe\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(I see, as I expected, it had been concealed\u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>A thin smile appeared on Guy\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Guy had realized.</p><br/><p>Lucia\u2019s extinction and Chloe\u2019s victory.</p><br/><p>And so\u2015\u2015 Just now, the fight in the northern land had ended.</p><br/><p>[1] (\u30a4\u30b0\u30cb\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3) Nouryoku Hatsudou, (Igunisshon), Ability Activation.</p><br/><p>[2] (\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30a2\u30d6\u30bd\u30fc\u30d6) Reigoku Shoushitsu Gyoushuu Ha (Howaitoauto Abus\u014dbu).</p><br/><p>[3] (\u30bb\u30bb\u30a4\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30fb\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8) Teishi Shoushitsu (Seseishon Rosuto), Suspended Dissipation.</p><br/><p>[4] (\u30bd\u30ea\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3) Banbutsu Kotaika (Soridifuikeishon), All Creation Solidification.</p><br/><p>[5] (\u30a2\u30d6\u30bd\u30fc\u30d6) Koukaku Kyuushuu (Abus\u014dbu), Downgrade Absorption.</p><br/><p>[6] Mind world, Mental world etc.</p><br/><p>[7]  Kagi, the kanji would normally mean key, but depending on the context, it can also means lock.</p><br/><p>[8] (\u30af\u30c8\u30a5\u30eb\u30d5) Hy\u014djin/K\u014dri Kami no Ou (Kuturufu).</p><br/><p>[9] \u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e Tadaima (I\u2019m home/I\u2019m back) used when you return to you home/a place where you belong to or to someone who you loved.

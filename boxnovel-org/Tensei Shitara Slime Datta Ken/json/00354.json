If it were, it would have killed all witnesses.</p><br/><p>So was it really survivors from the fallen city then\u2026?</p><br/><p>Nothing was certain, except that it was not related to the Empire.</p><br/><p>Then perhaps if she explained the situation\u2026</p><br/><p>At worst, it would mean she would have to kill it herself, but it might be worth trying to have a talk with it.</p><br/><p>After considering all of this, she came to a decision.</p><br/><p>The truth was, that while Michelle was one of the rulers, she had few subordinates she really trusted.</p><br/><p>There was her adjutant, Jegyll, and only a few others.</p><br/><p>Everyone obeyed her to be sure, but it was only because she had the strength of the Empire at her back.</p><br/><p>If she were to declare that the resistance were to be forgiven, then there would be some who would not follow her.</p><br/><p>Not only that, but it could result in yet another riot. Perhaps Michelle and those close to her would be purged.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>(From what information I have secretly gathered, there are clearly dissident within the Empire\u2026 )</p><br/><p>Yes, while Michelle was at the top of the ladder, she did not put her trust in the Empire.</p><br/><p>In that case, wasn\u2019t there a good chance that this enemy, which had nothing to do with the Empire, could become a valuable collaborator?</p><br/><p>She hoped so.</p><br/><p>And because of that\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn him! So he has betrayed me!! You shall pay for this, Karman!!\u201d</p><br/><p>She made a show of being furious.</p><br/><p>And since all were too scared to approach her when she was like this, she had a good excuse to tell everyone to wait while she went out to the field alone.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013And now.</p><br/><p>Michelle repressed her feelings of surprise as she faced Veldora and the others.</p><br/><p>There was a large man with gold hair and dark skin.</p><br/><p>A combat doll with a mask.</p><br/><p>And a small girl that she could tell nothing about.</p><br/><p>She was able to single out Beretta, as the reports had described the mask.</p><br/><p>However\u2014</p><br/><p>(This person called Beretta is indeed very powerful. But this man called Veldora\u2014)</p><br/><p>\u2013He had immense power that was incomparable to Beretta.</p><br/><p>Michelle had a specific method for measuring such things, and she could see through just about anyone.</p><br/><p>She could see just just how much energy people contained within them.</p><br/><p>Beretta\u2019s was immense.</p><br/><p>It was nearly unbelievable, but not exceeding understanding.</p><br/><p>However, this man called Veldora\u2026</p><br/><p>She had tried provoking him, but this was not the kind of person you wanted to get truly upset.</p><br/><p>And so she continued her act.</p><br/><p>She would use this opportunity to test him.</p><br/><p>Judge his true nature and determine whether or not he could be trusted.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>The fight began.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, are you ready? Give it all you got. I will show you how outmatched you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora declared and Michelle moved.</p><br/><p>A flashed cut the air in half.</p><br/><p>Michelle\u2019s blonde hair seemed to leave a trail of blinding light as she rushed towards Veldora.</p><br/><p>It was her right fist that was unleashed with immense power.</p><br/><p>Machinery Arts\u2013Vibration Fist Wave.</p><br/><p>Even without making contact with your target, you could apply ultra waves of energy, causing an internal change that put molecules into a high-vibration excited state.</p><br/><p>While it may have looked like a simple punch\u2014it was so fast that the eye could not see it\u2014and it had more than enough power to kill in the first hit.</p><br/><p>It was a combat art unique to this world\u2013Machinery Arts.</p><br/><p>For cyborgs whose joints could move freely, old ideas of combat had to be changed.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, as their fists were made of superalloys, the one who punched them would usually be the one who was hurt.</p><br/><p>As this was all pointless, it became necessary to develop a new way to fight that allowed you to remain safe while also dealing damage to your opponent.</p><br/><p>Machinery Arts was created during this time as a method that did not rely on direct contact.</p><br/><p>Veldora received Michelle\u2019s punch head-on.</p><br/><p>He parried Michelle\u2019s right fist with the palm of his left hand, then his torso moved forward to the left.</p><br/><p>From Michelle\u2019s point of view, Veldora\u2019s arm should have blown off, and his entire body should have taken damage by that point.</p><br/><p>She had not meant to kill him, but just deal a degree of damage.</p><br/><p>However, Veldora was completely unharmed.</p><br/><p>His body was made up of mysterious substances called magic essence and he was able to freely parry the vibrations.</p><br/><p>If it had been against Beretta, he would have taken damage by this unknown attack.</p><br/><p>However\u2014Physical damage was not effective on Veldora.</p><br/><p>And in a world where this magic essence did not exist, Veldora was an anomaly.</p><br/><p>There was no time to think about the laws of nature.</p><br/><p>Just as Beretta had been stumped by the unknown, Michelle was also confused by the irrationality of Veldora.</p><br/><p>Veldora then tried to move behind Michelle, but things didn\u2019t go too smoothly.</p><br/><p>While she was confused by Veldora, her instincts caused her to act quickly in dealing with any situation.</p><br/><p>Her momentum was not killed as she used the right foot she had planted in the ground as an axis and swung her left leg for a swipe kick.</p><br/><p>Veldora saw this and pulled in his jaw and bent backwards to dodge it.</p><br/><p>He continued to rotate in the air and landed a few feet away from Michelle.</p><br/><p>And with that, he had avoided being hit by her attacks twice in a row.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised. I didn\u2019t think you would be able to dodge my attacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKahahaha! Very impressive. This is more amusing than I could have ever imagined! Beretta! I think this woman might be stronger than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora said with a good-humored laugh.</p><br/><p>It had been a while since Veldora had last looked so important.</p><br/><p>But there was one thing that one shouldn\u2019t forget, and that was that Veldora was Zegion\u2019s master.</p><br/><p>Due to Veldora\u2019s usual words and actions, it was easy to think that he wasn\u2019t much, when he was in fact a first-rate martial artist.</p><br/><p>In one strike, he had seen the true nature of Michelle\u2019s art, and had even acquired it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was tied to what looked like a dirty log.</p><br/><p>But on closer inspection, it wasn\u2019t a log, but a person who had been turned into a tree.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! This guy had crawled into the NNU Magic and Science Investigation Academy, and so I punished him. As you commanded, I refrained from taking his life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo answered proudly.</p><br/><p>While it was true that he had not killed him, what did he intend to do now\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe. Once the questioning is finished, I intend to put him in the treant labyrinth town.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know if Trainee would like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think so? Then what if I give him to you as a present, Lord Rimuru?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him! This isn\u2019t just a questionable hobby, you know? They will question my sanity!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true. I am very sorry. Shall I burn him now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Maybe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation was like some kind of comedy sketch. Just then, the log\u2013I mean, Godama, began to cry.</p><br/><p>I felt a little sorry for him.</p><br/><p>But upon further questioning, it turned out that he was causing the most mischief in regards to my plans for the school\u2026 I could not forgive him for that.</p><br/><p>I had no reason to forgive him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, well. After making him an example for other fools and enduring one hundred years of tree life, he can be released. He may even be able to start life again if his brain is fine. In the end, it is important to repent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Lord Rimuru. You are always overflowing with mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, really?</p><br/><p>I felt like I was being rather harsh.</p><br/><p>He was feeling a lot of pain but couldn\u2019t die. He couldn\u2019t faint or even go mad. Perhaps it would be better to just die.</p><br/><p>However, he would be much more mentally stronger if he came out of this intact after a hundred years.</p><br/><p>Depending on his attitude at that time, I may just hire him at Tempest.</p><br/><p>It was not particularly pleasant, but it would work as an experiment.</p><br/><p>And there was one other person.</p><br/><p>Jujilas, who had been crying for quite some time now\u2026</p><br/><p>His heart certainly would not be able to survive turning into a tree\u2026</p><br/><p>Hmm. In fact, just like the small fry he was, he hadn\u2019t actually committed that grave a crime.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, he had affected the school and put meaningless status systems in place and shown open hostility towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI could kill him for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Souei was quick to say.</p><br/><p>Do you mean it? Diablo seemed to ask as he looked at Souei with surprise.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute? I just remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! This guy is fixated on class. We can strip him of his status and make him labor as a prisoner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. He can help clean the labyrinth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe. And there will be no worry of him dying if he wears the bracelet.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like a very harsh punishment indeed.</p><br/><p>The bracelet would cause him to resurrect every time that he died.</p><br/><p>And cleaning the labyrinth was very dangerous work.</p><br/><p>A certain number of the monsters had been dealt with, but there was still parts that needed work.</p><br/><p>It was Trainee and the other labyrinth managers that went their periodically, but they would need people to help them.</p><br/><p>Or course, it was all very dangerous.</p><br/><p>There was a possibility of being killed by monsters repeatedly. So it was usually work for prison laborers.</p><br/><p>The least popular job in Tempest.</p><br/><p>However, this was not the kind of conversation we could have in front of the students.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just a matter of having a bad influence on them.</p><br/><p>So all of these thoughts remained in my head as I decided on Godama and Jujilas\u2019s fates.</p><br/><p>After that, there was also Magnus, Rozari and Irina.</p><br/><p>Irina would sometimes look at my face and shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk. Just kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah! How typical!</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe. Then without further ado!\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo began to move, and so I stopped him frantically.</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t kill the person who begs to be killed.</p><br/><p>It was against the rules.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, I understand that you hate me and everything. But, it\u2019s not exactly justified. The ruler cannot just stand by without resisting during a war. A country cannot exist without protecting its citizen\u2019s safety and assets. It is fine if people want to sing about being pacifists, but the ruler cannot. Or else the country will fall. Can you understand that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 I understand that I am wrong. But! I cannot help but hate you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, she couldn\u2019t help herself then.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

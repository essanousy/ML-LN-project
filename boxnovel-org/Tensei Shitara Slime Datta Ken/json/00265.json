We will head for the island\u2019s edge with just the battle elites. It\u2019s fine if we can call for help there. And even if we can\u2019t we will be able to collect points.\u201d</p><br/><p>He declared, as if it was obvious from the start.</p><br/><p>Julius\u2019 reasoning went like this:</p><br/><p>There are some students who can also use \u2018s.p.a.ce storage\u2019 so they will be setting up a base here.</p><br/><p>The research, economics and politics students will engage in constructing a place to sleep. Food supply is also not stable so they will be gathering as much food as they can.</p><br/><p>While doing that, they will take actions such that they gain the most points possible.</p><br/><p>The fact that some students got points just for helping set up the tent was made public and so they wanted to find out if there were any other ways to get points, as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people staying behind, you guys also need to act such that you get as much point as possible. It won\u2019t be a problem if we can blow away the mana storm but if we were to fail, we won\u2019t have any other choice than to listen to those pirates. Being isolated in this island for labor work-we mustn\u2019t accept that at any cost. The most important thing is to earn points and at least make it out of the island!\u201d</p><br/><p>Julius\u2019 confidant gave a speech.</p><br/><p>If I remember right, he is Julius\u2019 escort knight and his name is Clad.</p><br/><p>It seems like Clad has been entrusted with leading the students.</p><br/><p>It also looks like making certain of battle types is also Clad\u2019s job.</p><br/><p>As soon as he was done with his speech, he looked at the students and started selecting the ones who seemed to be dependable in fights. And then, he made groups of 5.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat plan is better than I expected. I was worried he would work us really hard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespite everything you say, you really do your job properly after all, Karma. While Julius does treat you like an idiot and what not, I am sure he can\u2019t ignore your skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, I could hear Karma and Magnus having a conversation.</p><br/><p>Maybe because of the mingling in the academy, they seemed to be closer than just normal acquaintances.</p><br/><p>Although, it also doesn\u2019t seem like both of them trust each other from the bottom of their hearts.</p><br/><p>I secretly listened to their conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I will cooperate. What\u2019s important is everyone being saved and if he does it properly then I am willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, then I shall also see how it turns out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Putting the serious Karma aside, even Magnus didn\u2019t seem like he would oppose Julius.</p><br/><p>Well, it is true that having a dispute at this point wouldn\u2019t be a wise thing to do but\u2026</p><br/><p>But it looks like Karma was even more surprised by Magnus\u2019 words than me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rare. For you to listen to Julius.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really. It is true that what he said makes sense. If we just earn the points, we won\u2019t be left in this island. If we do that, we could look for opportunities to call for help while pretending to do as the kidnappers say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then I guess we will be having a joint struggle for a while, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, I will be counting on you, Karma.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here, Magnus.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Karma asked surprised, Magnus just replied shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p>It seems even Karma was convinced by his logic.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, it seems both of them aren\u2019t actually content with Julius taking the lead but they have come to the conclusion that they will see how it goes for a while.</p><br/><p>They are much more rational and it isn\u2019t like they completely lack the spirit of cooperativeness like I had thought earlier.</p><br/><p>My opinion of them has improved but still, we have a whole to go.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to hurry so I shall be watching closely.</p><br/><p>Now then, it would be great if they go at it with this level of cooperativeness-while thinking that, I restrained from making an evaluation before the results.</p><br/><p>The grouping had ended.</p><br/><p>5 teams were made and 5 members were in each group.</p><br/><p>As you can only register 5 people in the bracelet, the group members were now registering each other.</p><br/><p>And the members of Julius\u2019 group were registering all of the 5 members of the other groups.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

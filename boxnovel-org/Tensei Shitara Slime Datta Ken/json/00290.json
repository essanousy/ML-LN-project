I think everyone will be really happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Marsha smiled happily.</p><br/><p>And while we were doing that, the students woke up one by one and came out.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Even the instructors who were in critical condition came out and thought it was weird that their wounds had healed but they all understood once they saw me.</p><br/><p>I will applaud them that they didn\u2019t say anything unnecessary.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be done soon. Could you prepare the bath in the meantime?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I asked that of Marsha, she replied \u2018got it!\u2019 and happily nodded before going off to the for-bath-use tent.</p><br/><p>It seemed like she was in shock because of the events last night but now that she saw good food and has something she can do, she had regained some willpower.</p><br/><p>At times like this, it is good to do something to change gears.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>First, we have food.</p><br/><p>And then, we get in the tub to wash away all the dirt from the battle.</p><br/><p>There are probably those who were bathed in the others\u2019 blood too so it would be good for them to be clean.</p><br/><p>And after that\u2013</p><br/><p>As Marsha left, William came up to me seeing I was alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs now a good time, Rimuru-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>He came to speak as the representative.</p><br/><p>I nodded and decided to plan on what to do from now on.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre all the wounded healed?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYes. With the help of the healing potions you gave us, everyone has healed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I think you understand but\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I told them these are healing potions Pyuri the health doctor prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2013However, how exactly are we, still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Moss was there.\u201d</p><br/><p>To introduce him to sage William, I called out Moss.</p><br/><p>[It is very nice to meet you. I am Testarossa-sama\u2019s aide, who is of the equal rank and is a coworker to Diablo, who is Rimuru-sama\u2019s trusted retainer. I am called Moss. Pleased to make your acquaintance\u2013]</p><br/><p>The small Moss showed hypocritical courtesy as he introduced himself to William.</p><br/><p>But William didn\u2019t take any offense from that, rather he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cA-ah, yes, same here. I thank you for saving us.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Although Moss is being used as a handyman, his position in Tempest is indeed high. I guess he would be a god-like existence even to the academy\u2019s elders.</p><br/><p>Besides, even though Moss looks like this, even arch demons don\u2019t match up to him.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t weird for the sage William\u2019s expression to stiffen seeing a being who can destroy large countries with ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, will this \u2018Human Liberation Alliance\u2019 thing be taken care of by Moss-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>William asked me, pulling himself together.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

I had completely assumed that anyone who opposed you would be annihilated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s vexing seeing how my image is being passed on like this.</p><br/><p>I mean, sure, I would annihilate people who are clearly enemies but I won\u2019t go killing everyone like a barbarian just because their position is in opposition to mine\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNow listen here, \u2018enemy\u2019 can mean many different things, alright? I would have crushed them if they were destroying towns or killing people but the Human Liberation Alliance is different, right? I will just fight them in their own ring and have defeat etch into their mind and body so that they never think of opposing me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In the first place, it is hard to charge anyone this time.</p><br/><p>What the Human Liberation Alliance did was persuading the students and instructors to agree to their thinking\u2014which is to free themselves of me, the demon lord\u2019s rule.</p><br/><p>Even if money is involved in this, it would be hard to judge it as a crime.</p><br/><p>It is clear that they are opposing me but they are innocent in terms of law.</p><br/><p>That is the tough part.</p><br/><p>It is true that I hold absolute authority but even then I wouldn\u2019t around tampering with the laws freely.</p><br/><p>I can suggest a certain law in the parliament but a majority vote can only bring it to shape. Well, even then, most of my laws would pass but I never really presented a law to begin with.</p><br/><p>I had decided to not touch politics since the time I started leading the Goblins.</p><br/><p>All I had to do was watch over the management after fixing a set of rules.</p><br/><p>I could easily reject an absurd law suggestion by a lower legislature house and even if they do pass, I could reject them later. Even I need to go through the proper procedures to set a new law.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>I don\u2019t have any plans on trying to do anything absurd like \u2018to death with him!\u2019 and even if I did, it wouldn\u2019t pass.</p><br/><p>This time around as well, I am upholding such values.</p><br/><p>Even the actions taken in this island\u2014I can condemn them in terms of humanity but there are no concise law.</p><br/><p>They had been hiding their identity until the instructors or students who could pose a problem were defeated.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>But to say that is a crime is difficult.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt that they left the others to die but it can\u2019t be said to be a crime just because they didn\u2019t save them.</p><br/><p>They probably plan on leaving the students or teachers who won\u2019t cooperate in the island and have the monsters deal with them\u2014but that can\u2019t be charged as a crime as of yet.</p><br/><p>After all, they can\u2019t be charged unless they directly had a hand in it.</p><br/><p>They haven\u2019t committed any clear crimes at present and the actions which they are assumed to take when leaving the island are just assumptions.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a pain but since I don\u2019t have any charges I can file against them, I can\u2019t do anything yet.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cIf so, what do you plan on doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple, William-kun. The students who are angry at Magnus for the betrayal will try to take revenge. That too by a legal and formal way\u2014by a duel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2013Don\u2019t tell me, Julius and Karma? However, with the skill difference between them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a problem. We still have 3 days. Once they are done eating, I plan on going full spartan coaching on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-oh\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will have you cooperate as well. And then we will win and return triumphantly. They probably plan on leaving anyone who don\u2019t align with their ideals in this island. However, if we are able to escape this island with everyone alive, we will win. Right?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

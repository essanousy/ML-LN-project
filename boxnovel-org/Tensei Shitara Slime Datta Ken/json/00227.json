Everything is going as planned\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris nods to Benimaru\u2019s mutters.</p><br/><p>Ramiris is sitting on a luxurious chair which made exclusively for her personal use, taking a contemplative pose of putting her clasped hands in front of her chin.[1]</p><br/><p>Benimaru stands on her right side, looking at the screen keenly.</p><br/><p>Although the two people are conversing as if their atmosphere is serious\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t fool around, do your work!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shuna hits Benimaru\u2019s head with a folded fan in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cOuch! Hey, it\u2019s hurts if it\u2019s folded! Don\u2019t you have any gentleness for your beloved older brother!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s none. That kind of thing is unimportant, please do your job seriously!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shuna cut him down in single hit.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s another person who supporting Shuna with their words.</p><br/><p>That person is Beretta.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy are you fooling around, Ramiris-sama\u2026\u2026 If you don\u2019t stop, I will report this to Rimuru-sama, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWai! You, what are you talking about! I\u2019m being serious~!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris panicking after hearing Beretta\u2019s tsukkomi.</p><br/><p>She stops doing her competitive behavior and starting to explain in panic.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou too, Benimaru. It\u2019s not time for playing around, a very serious crisis is approaching, be more conscious\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Scolded by Souei, Benimaru meekly nods.</p><br/><p>Although he and Ramiris are enjoying themselves with the atmosphere\u2026\u2026 it seems to be taken negatively by the serious people.</p><br/><p>(This is because these guys are not playful\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>(Hey. I only playing around a bit, I wish Rimuru wasn\u2019t mad at me\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Their gaze intersect, Benimaru and Ramiris are communicating their inner feelings.</p><br/><p>However, they can read the mood and so they decided to stop playing anymore.</p><br/><p>In fact, the situation is unsatisfactory.</p><br/><p>The floors that have been invaded so far by the enemy are displayed on the big screen.</p><br/><p>According to the display, the enemy is fighting the boss of the 50th floor currently.</p><br/><p>With a terrifying speed, the enemy broke all of the past records.</p><br/><p>In such critical situation, Benimaru and Ramiris still have time for their behavior.</p><br/><p>Which isn\u2019t surprising\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A little while ago, an order from Rimuru had reached Benimaru.</p><br/><p>Rimuru conveyed the enemy\u2019s predicted goal and the countermeasures.</p><br/><p>As for defending the labyrinth, Benimaru and the others[2] are not needed.</p><br/><p>To this matter, Ramiris and Zegion agreed, intercepting the intruder by themselves is decided unanimously.</p><br/><p>Benimaru presents everybody\u2019s intentions to Rimuru who still anxious about the labyrinth war potentials.</p><br/><p>And then, from Rimuru, \u2018Defend the labyrinth till the end!\u2019 such order was received.</p><br/><p>Benimaru still hasn\u2019t recovered from the exhaustion after his fight with Kazaream, but there\u2019s no worry about that.</p><br/><p>After all, it\u2019s due to the thick density of the magic essence inside the labyrinth which beyond comparison from the outside. Noticeably, he can feel that his energy is recovering.</p><br/><p>Moreover, probably because he released magic essences to the limit once, he has a hunch that he can take in the energy of\u300eTurn Null\u300fwhile becoming more used to it.</p><br/><p>Filling and mixing it while emptying the container little by little, in a sense replenishing magic essence at the same time.</p><br/><p>(Huff! Like this, I think I can considerably control this energy!)</p><br/><p>The top group of the defense war potential of the labyrinth is still alive, in the worst case; Benimaru might also need to go too.</p><br/><p>Prediction of the enemy\u2019s action can be made, and the war potentials are alive.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no factor to be uneasy of.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell. Then, should we work seriously now?</p><br/><p>Ramiris-sama, what is the percentage of the labyrinth that has been eroded by that guy currently?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u2026 right now, it\u2019s 15% I think. There\u2019s still more to spare!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood. So, when Gozurl and Mezurl on the 50th floor are defeated, do we commence the strategy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell. As my preparations will be done with just a bit more, it\u2019ll be the right time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, we will start.\u300d</p><br/><p>After such exchange, Benimaru began to issue instructions regarding the specific strategy.</p><br/><p>Ramiris also resumes her work.</p><br/><p>Gozurl and Mezurl who were defeated easily are revived on the lowest floor.</p><br/><p>And then they come to the control room ashamed.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood work! Well, please rest at ease.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re very sorry, we have no excuse to offer, Benimaru-sama. We wanted to exhaust the enemy even a bit though\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe are not even an obstacle to that guy\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t mind it. You guys aren\u2019t weak, it's just those guys are strong.</p><br/><p>Be relieved as everything is as planned.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gozurl and Mezurl who hanged their heads in front of Benimaru seem to have been relieved a little when they heard those words.</p><br/><p>With meek faces, they sit on the reserved chairs.</p><br/><p>At the same time\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then. As planned, the strategy will start! Everyone, on your position!!</p><br/><p>The strategy will be put into action now.</p><br/><p>And then, at the time of the retrieval of the Demon Golem (Demon Lord Protector Colossus), the strategy will shift to its second stage.</p><br/><p>Everything is as planned. Everyone, accomplish your own work without rushing! Leave the rest to the combat group!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru ordered so.</p><br/><p>Tension runs through to the Ramiris\u2019 subordinates, the Dragon Kings and the operator, the dryads with Trainee as their leader.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, Ramiris-sama. I shall depart too.\u300d</p><br/><p>Beretta respectfully told Ramiris.</p><br/><p>\u300cOk! You can lose, but dying is not permitted!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu, what a joke. If I lost so many times, then I\u2019ll be branded as a loser. I\u2019ll surely triumph this time.\u300d</p><br/><p>Leaving behind those words, Beretta immediately teleport away.</p><br/><p>Then, he already stood by Zegion\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>And so, the battle inside the labyrinth slowly intensifies\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>The guardian of the 60th floor is the Demon Golem.</p><br/><p>It received order to eliminate the intruder, showing its overwhelming destructive power, it\u2019s a violence machine.</p><br/><p>Modified by Gadra-roushi, it\u2019s equipped with various weapons; its viciousness is nothing like before.</p><br/><p>However, in front of Dino and co, even with its power, stalling the enemy didn\u2019t come true.</p><br/><p>\u300cGeez, it\u2019s so much trouble\u2026\u2026this thing is stupidly strong\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRather than that, why doesn\u2019t it vanish as light particles?</p><br/><p>Just probably though\u2026\u2026 This golem won\u2019t revive, right\u2026..?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt won\u2019t I guess. Oh well, even if it did, it\u2019s not a threat anyway.</p><br/><p>But if it\u2019s about this thing is troublesome, I\u2019d agree.\u300d</p><br/><p>To Dino\u2019s grumble, Pico and Garasha respond respectively.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Dino thinks that it\u2019s absurd for Golem which is an artificial object to revive, but recalling Ramiris\u2019 wicked smile, there was an uneasiness which makes Dino unable to deny it.</p><br/><p>(If it\u2019s that person, it might be possible\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not Ramiris who has the power to be a threat, but that can\u2019t be said with the other people in the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, their threat level are beyond imagination with the bestowed immortality inside Ramiris\u2019 controlled area.</p><br/><p>Besides, Ramiris\u2019 ability is unreasonable, it won\u2019t be strange if she was able to grant the effect even to an artificial being.</p><br/><p>From Dino\u2019s point of view, Ramiris\u2019\u300eLabyrinth Creation\u300f was such a threat.</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, the enemy was suddenly gone. From floor 61, I\u2019m sure that ghost type enemy would come out in swarms, right? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s true. I sighted low-class wraiths, but they\u2019re only small fry\u2026\u2026 In that case, the upper floors were more troublesome, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>As Pico and Garasha said, they can\u2019t see any appearance of enemies after they defeated the Demon Golem and descended a floor below.</p><br/><p>But, Zero knew the reason why. That\u2019s because Adalman and co went outside to intercept Dagruel, which Zero witnessed himself.</p><br/><p>Because there\u2019s no reason to tell it, Zero keeps his silence.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, maybe because of that. Perhaps, they went to intercept Dagruel I guess.\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino carelessly said the correct answer.</p><br/><p>Zero hears it, he thought that he needs to raise his evaluation of Dino a bit.</p><br/><p>Zero thought that Dino is a foolish guy, but he\u2019s surprised due to Dino\u2019s sharpness in the situational awareness.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, did that means all monsters from here on were outside? Can you do such a thing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRather than that\u2026\u2026 Using the monsters living inside the labyrinth as an army\u2026\u2026 Honesty, isn\u2019t that a foul play?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI dunno, don\u2019t say it to me. Say your complains to Rimuru!\u300d</p><br/><p>Because enemies won\u2019t come out, Dino and co have such free time to have such talkative quarrel.</p><br/><p>Zero who indifferently watched them, opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys, listen.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m going to return to the 60th floor, I\u2019ll concentrate in my work to steal the authority of this labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Even now I have eroded the labyrinth as we travelled, but only about 15% taken by me and it\u2019s not advancing.</p><br/><p>However, I succeeded in containing the transfer function.</p><br/><p>Above the 60th floor has become my area.</p><br/><p>However, it will take time to erode 61th floor and below.</p><br/><p>As the way things are going, it won\u2019t progress well.</p><br/><p>I leave the rest to you guys, rampage as much as you can and earn me time.\u300d</p><br/><p>Zero was able to analyze mostly of the enemy\u2019s war potential.</p><br/><p>As he attacking with a small group of people, there\u2019s no fear of the group being divided into parts.</p><br/><p>It would be the suitable time soon.</p><br/><p>With the roots of his ability stretched around since the time he entered, he succeeded in stealing a part of the authority of the labyrinth\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>After that he thought to concentrate himself in eroding the labyrinth and finish this mission quickly.</p><br/><p>Shutting down the teleport means that a direct attack to Zero inside the labyrinth becomes impossible.</p><br/><p>Then, he judged that by letting Dino and co advance and rampaging around, in that opportunity he would be able to concentrate in taking over the control of the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>\u300cAhh, leave it to me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino responded powerfully to Zero\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Zero nods to the answer, he says\u300cRampage as much as you want\u300dand then he turned his back.</p><br/><p>Zero returns to the 60th floor\u2019s boss room while confirming the safety of the surroundings.</p><br/><p>And then, he unleashes the ability of the completed and evolved Ultimate Skill\u300eEvil Dragon Lord Azi Dahaka\u300fand begins the encroachment of the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>In order to usurp the labyrinth complexly.</p><br/><p>\u300eEvil Dragon Lord Azi Dahaka\u300fhas the ability to make clones infinitely by spreading its roots to the ground, but it was originally ability of\u300eEnergy Absorption\u300f on the surroundings.</p><br/><p>It assimilates into surroundings\u2019 natural environment, and make it possible to regenerate himself infinitely as part of the nature.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s, the truth of Ultimate Skill\u300eEvil Dragon Lord Azi Dahaka\u300f and its correct usage.</p><br/><p>The environment that has its energy sucked up empty will be ruined and destroyed.</p><br/><p>By assimilating to this labyrinth, he will plunder the authority of the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>If he does so, Zero will be able to steal the power of Ramiris\u2019\u300eLabyrinth Creation\u300f.</p><br/><p>Even in case he fails, he could cancel the authority and nullify it.</p><br/><p>Then, at his side has four strong people of awakened Demon Lord Class, they would be superior in fighting power, so was Zero\u2019s calculation.</p><br/><p>(In the worst case, I will suck up the energy of this labyrinth and destroy it</p><br/><p>Then, in any case, the enemy doesn\u2019t have refuge. They will hastily flee and rounded up by Mai\u2019s concentrated attack. Although, if I finish assimilating with this labyrinth, I won\u2019t let the enemy escape\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>Zero is convinced of the victory.</p><br/><p>Zero thought that immortality inside the labyrinth is troublesome, and by manipulating the dimension and space making it impossible for an army to capture the labyrinth is invincible.</p><br/><p>However, if ability of the labyrinth is sealed off, it\u2019s Zero\u2019s side\u2019s turn to invade.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think that it\u2019s funny that Dino and co so abnormally wary inside the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Certainly, it\u2019s a dangerous ability.</p><br/><p>However, for Zero, the more dangerous the labyrinth is, greater the power as the reward after he deprives it.</p><br/><p>(Velda-sama, it\u2019s our victory!)</p><br/><p>Zero sits with his legs crossed and concentrated his mind on eroding the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>The three people go ahead, leaving Zero behind.</p><br/><p>Although Dino declared his reply impressively to Zero, inside his mind is\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(Idiot. From the start, don\u2019t expect someone else to help your work and such.</p><br/><p>But, I can\u2019t even run away from Velda-sama\u2019s side\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Because there\u2019s a thing with Rimuru too, I can\u2019t do careless action\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ahhhh how troublesome\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!\uff09</p><br/><p>So, various conflicts jumbled together.</p><br/><p>Consequently, with that gloomy Zero gone, it becomes very refreshing.</p><br/><p>Dino and co felt uneasy due to being observed so much.</p><br/><p>In either case, escaping was already impossible.</p><br/><p>Dino and co give up and go to the other side.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey~, isn\u2019t that guy is super strict! Who do he think he is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. Ordering us self-importantly, to be frank, I hate it. Why did you do exactly what he told you to do, Dino?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight right! Dino, please beat that guy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. If you kill that guy, we will cooperate so it will not be exposed Velda-sama, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2018That guy you mention, is Zero you know!?\u2019 so Dino thought while laughing vaguely to dodge the issue.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way to not be exposed, and to be honest, it\u2019s troublesome.</p><br/><p>With this and that, Dino and co arrives at the 70th floor.</p><br/><p>However, that place is naturally empty\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected, Adalman has gone to the battlefield.</p><br/><p>It would be troublesome if that guy remain here, aren\u2019t we lucky?\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino thinks positively.</p><br/><p>Pico and Garasha also agree and then they go ahead.</p><br/><p>However, even below floor 71th, no enemies appear.</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t this strange? This place should be the paradise of the insect type monster though\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>When Dino says his doubt\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300eHoohohohoho! You came, Dino.</p><br/><p>You had betrayed me not a long ago, I will make you regret it now!!\u300f</p><br/><p>Ramiris\u2019s loud laughter echoed in the surroundings, suddenly, the structure of the floor changes.</p><br/><p>And then 4 shadows appeared.</p><br/><p>Gabil, Gerudo, Beretta and then Zegion.</p><br/><p>Those 4 are the one who appear to meet Dino and Co.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch. They come out as expected heh\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino looked up above and saw Zegion.</p><br/><p>\u300eEh? Dino, you guys are only three people?\u300f</p><br/><p>Ramiris asked Dino.</p><br/><p>In Dino\u2019s eyes who looking at Ramiris who waiting for answer, he saw Ramiris being projected with stereoscopic imaging.</p><br/><p>(She does such elaborate action for weird stuff\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh well whatever\u2019 so he sighs,</p><br/><p>\u300cOne person is late due to his business.\u300d</p><br/><p>So, Dino replied indifferently.</p><br/><p>Besides,\u300eHmm.\u300f and nodding, Ramiris drops a bombshell statement.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell then, Dino\u2019s opponents are Zegion and Beretta heh~\u300f</p><br/><p>So.</p><br/><p>\u2019What did she say?\u2019 Dino fails to understand it.</p><br/><p>But, when her words reach his brain, he understands the meaning.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t joke around, you idiot!! Like hell I could win!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino\u2019s scream who understands the meaning of Ramiris\u2019 words echoed inside the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>[1] For those who didn\u2019t realize what Ramiris doing, she\u2019s doing Gendo Pose.</p><br/><p>[2] Meant for those who went outside Tempest and not present and defending Tempest from the start like Gabil and Gerudo.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Because, if the predation failed, and I took a direct hit, my body would be destroyed with that one shot.</p><br/><p>I feared that the destruction speed would be quicker than my ability to escape via clone.</p><br/><p>Having a clone ready from the start, similar to my first battle against Hinata, would be pointless.</p><br/><p>After all, if I couldn\u2019t grant Ultimate Abilities onto the clone, it would be immediately destroyed.</p><br/><p>In the end, the seemingly all-powerful clone couldn\u2019t be used for anything other than as a decoy against weaker foes.</p><br/><p>Well it depended on the opponent, and, with retreat being a priority, if victory wasn\u2019t necessary, then there were several uses for it.</p><br/><p>Under circumstances where defeat wasn\u2019t an option, it would be useless.</p><br/><p>Therefore, I had to defeat the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d head-on.</p><br/><p>Attacks other than \u201cStorm Blast\u201d would be dodged if possible, and otherwise offset with another attack.</p><br/><p>With Raphael\u2019s calculations assisting my instincts, it had gotten much easier since a while ago.</p><br/><p>However, it was true that the abilities of the Ultimate Skill \u300eStorm King Veldora\u300f were left behind really helped.</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t there, there were high chances of defeat due to the not being able to offset the oncoming attacks.</p><br/><p>The fact that the abilities were able to remain was probably due to Veldora\u2019s timing.</p><br/><p>You\u2019ve done all this, so I\u2019ve got to answer to those expectations.</p><br/><p>And so I attempted to find the timing.</p><br/><p>Since I didn\u2019t know the location of Veldora\u2019s Nucleic Heart, I couldn\u2019t initiate any attacks.</p><br/><p>Or rather, there were ways for me to attack, however it would be difficult to inflict any fatal damage.</p><br/><p>Using various Nuclear Strike magics overlapped by Ultimate Skills would definitely inflict some damage.</p><br/><p>I could also use \u300eHoly Demonic Inversion\u300f, and release a holy attribute Ultimate Magic \u201cDisintegration\u201d.</p><br/><p>However, this kind of magic wouldn\u2019t be fatal with just one or two shots.</p><br/><p>This was, without a doubt, due to the greatest trait of the \u201cTrue Dragons\u201d that even surpassed that of Demon Lords, their heightened durability.</p><br/><p>Even so, if I wanted to take down the Heart-less \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d, I\u2019d only have to assemble a multi-layered magic formation, and strike with the compressed synergetic magic.</p><br/><p>After all, without the Heart, its attacks had become patterned, and through her calculations, Wisdom Lord Raphael could perceive the next attack.</p><br/><p>Having analyzed many attack patterns, she used the knowledge to make her predictions.</p><br/><p>This was something I didn\u2019t understand, but analyzing algorithms was indeed very useful.</p><br/><p>Though I thought it was enough to just randomize our attacks since their results would get their \u201cprobability manipulated\u201d\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After all, it was at a Heart-less, rampaging state.</p><br/><p>One could call this the sorrow of the dominated.</p><br/><p>Frankly speaking, the reason I could also evade was thanks to this.</p><br/><p>And now, with Wisdom Lord Raphael, it was like having a child as an opponent.</p><br/><p>Wisdom Lord Raphael-san who was brimming with confidence for some reason could easily come up with a plan to kill.</p><br/><p>And thus, simply defeating it was not an issue.</p><br/><p>There were two problems.</p><br/><p>The time limit, and the location of the Nucleic Heart.</p><br/><p>If by chance, the Heart got destroyed then it was all over.</p><br/><p>Complete operation failure.</p><br/><p>The main body of the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d would be under the complete dominion of the Emperor, and the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d needed for Veldora\u2019s resurrection would no longer be reconstructible.</p><br/><p>Then it would all be meaningless.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I had to be careful.</p><br/><p>I was looking for the right timing since a while ago.</p><br/><p>The reason I got close to the rampaging \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d, and initiated a close combat, was for this timing.</p><br/><p>The clock was ticking, but I didn\u2019t worry.</p><br/><p>There were 2 minutes remaining, but rather than rushing I evaded the attacks, slyly creeping in, and shortening our distance.</p><br/><p>The more our distances shortened , the harder it became to evade the attacks\u2026\u2026 however Raphael\u2019s attack prediction increased dodging precision.</p><br/><p>With my intuition and \u300eFuture Attack Prediction\u300f used simultaneously, we could somehow manage to evade.</p><br/><p>Carefully, without flustering, indifferently handling the attacks \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 Now!</p><br/><p>Without overlooking the opening for an instant immediately right after the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d attacked, I activated Gluttony King Belzebuth, and devoured the \u201cStorm Dragon\u2019s\u201d main body.</p><br/><p>My body changed from human to fluid form, its viscous property strongly emphasizing the irregular shape.</p><br/><p>In accordance to my intentions to attack and devour, it changed into a shape suitable to entangle the opponent.</p><br/><p>To bind, and devour the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>However, naturally, the opponent was too large. Even if I stretched my body, I couldn\u2019t pass a certain point.</p><br/><p>However, there was no need to worry, as Gluttony King Belzebuth\u2019s erosion had begun.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, the \u201cStorm Dragon\u2019s\u201d destruction aura that resisted hostile existences had begun to break down my body.</p><br/><p>Towards I who was trying to devour it, the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d in turn attempted to exhaust me.</p><br/><p>A violent attrition battle had begun.</p><br/><p>It hurt, it burned, it was excruciating.</p><br/><p>I was not supposed to feel pain, yet now, intense pain surged throughout my body.</p><br/><p>Me feeling heat didn\u2019t make any sense either, yet I felt like I was melting.</p><br/><p>This was the first time I felt like this in this world, this intense pain.</p><br/><p>My intuition detecting the destruction of my very existence may have stimulated my senses.</p><br/><p>However, I will never slow down the predation.</p><br/><p>I will win.</p><br/><p>At this rate the \u201cStorm Dragon (Energy)\u201d will be devoured and absorbed.</p><br/><p>And then, Veldora\u2019s Heart will be separated, and the \u201ccurse\u201d that destroyed the magic circuit will be analyzed and nullified.</p><br/><p>For that, this amount of pain was nothing.</p><br/><p>(Raphael, are there any problems?)</p><br/><p>\u300aSolution. There are absolutely no problems.\u300b</p><br/><p>Everything\u2019s alright.</p><br/><p>Obtaining the absolute answer, I further accelerated the erosion.</p><br/><p>As as I converted what I devoured into energy, the equivalent amount of flesh was destroyed.</p><br/><p>My flesh was reconstructed once more, and the erosion continued.</p><br/><p>This repeatedly repeated.</p><br/><p>Time was running out, and with the target being so large, I feared that I would not make it.</p><br/><p>However, I believed in Wisdom Lord Raphael.</p><br/><p>I will make it in time.</p><br/><p>\u300aAlert. Reporting results of Parallel Analysis.</p><br/><p>Analysis of \u201cCardinal Acceleration\u201d has concluded.</p><br/><p>Reproduction of ability has failed.</p><br/><p>Analysis of \u201cStorm Blast\u201d has concluded.</p><br/><p>Reproduction of ability successful\u2026\u2026it is now possible to use it.</p><br/><p>Analysis of \u201cStorm Dragon Energy\u201d has concluded.</p><br/><p>It is now possible to reconfigure the bodily composition into the same type as \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>Would you like to execute? YES/NO \u300b</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you just say something weird?</p><br/><p>Even though the analysis of \u201cCardinal Acceleration\u201d was a success, it\u2019s natural I wouldn\u2019t be able to use it.</p><br/><p>Since I didn\u2019t take \u201cScorch Dragon\u201d Velgrynd\u2019s abilities, replicating her Ultimate Skill merely by seeing it would be impossible.</p><br/><p>The fact I was able to use \u201cStorm Blast\u201d after analyzing made sense.</p><br/><p>My Ultimate Skill \u300eStorm King Veldora\u300f remained, and the power\u2019s basis had already been analyzed.</p><br/><p>Although it\u2019s amazing I could use a powerful ability and I\u2019m happy about it, it\u2019s something that fell within the range of my understanding.</p><br/><p>If it was Wisdom Lord Raphael-san, this wasn\u2019t unusual, I got used to it.</p><br/><p>However, that last line.</p><br/><p>It was possible to reconfigure my body into the same type as a \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t quite get the meaning of this.</p><br/><p>If my understanding is correct, that would mean I would become the same as a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300aAnswer. That inference is correct. \u300b</p><br/><p>The wha-!?</p><br/><p>Correct, err, hey you!?</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Are you serious?</p><br/><p>\u300aInquiry. Would you like to begin reconstructing your body into a \u201cTrue Dragon? YES/NO \u300b</p><br/><p>Fufufu, Fuhaha, Fuhahahahaha\uff01</p><br/><p>Certainly, I executed a 3 part laugh, and thus commanded.</p><br/><p>YES! (TN: \u201cI\u2019m now one step closer to My Veldora!\u201d Rimuru, jk.)</p><br/><p>In that instant, the pain I felt vanished.</p><br/><p>The pain, the heat, the agony.</p><br/><p>Due to my new body, the corrosive anti-threat aura the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d released was nullified.</p><br/><p>In other words, I now simply kept on devouring, and converted everything into my energy.</p><br/><p>Rapidly, my magic Energy replenished, and began to rise.</p><br/><p>That was done at an accelerated pace, because if I slowed down against the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d, it would be fatal.</p><br/><p>If this was Veldora, he probably would have been able to immediately respond.</p><br/><p>But, since the dominated being was only the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d, it didn\u2019t have the corresponding reaction speed.</p><br/><p>In the first place, if Veldora was the opponent, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to even get a hold of him.</p><br/><p>This being was only able to act in accordance to its programming.</p><br/><p>Once I understood this, it was no longer a threat.</p><br/><p>(Now then, let\u2019s end this!</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t forgive you (Bastard) for calling yourself my cherished \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>Devour, Gluttony King Belzebuth!!)</p><br/><p>(TN: This Rimuru x Veldora ship is cruising on!) (EN: cherished\u2026 0.0)</p><br/><p>In accordance to my order, Gluttony King Belzebuth gleefully restarted devouring \u201cStorm Dragon (Energy)\u201d. And that, at a terrifying speed.</p><br/><p>Unlike previously, the power-balance was now one-sided.</p><br/><p>The hunter, and the hunted. It was the very essence of the law of the Jungle.</p><br/><p>And so, my body had been reconstructed into a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d, my Energy broke through the limit, and continued to increase.</p><br/><p>An evolution and rebirth had occurred, and blinding light flooded the surroundings.</p><br/><p>My old body couldn\u2019t withstand the energy used for the reconstruction into a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d, and it was released in an explosion of light.</p><br/><p>\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>When the light faded, the \u201cStorm Dragon\u2019s\u201d figure had disappeared.</p><br/><p>In its place was an unknown life form.</p><br/><p>Devouring the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d which could be called its parent, its body was reborn as the 5th \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d, the Ultimate Slime (Viscous Dragonoid Demon God). (EN: haha, wtf )</p><br/><p>That figure soon took the form of a human.</p><br/><p>It looked around the age of 15~16, with a lustrous silver hair with a visible hint of violet mixed into it.</p><br/><p>With golden eyes that looked as if it could see all, they were sharp and beautiful.</p><br/><p>Albeit genderless, one could call her features cute rather than beautiful.</p><br/><p>However, clad in a divine aura (presence), her beauty was sublime.</p><br/><p>A single sword in her hand, she lacked clothing.(TN: now THIS is an LN illustration I\u2019d like to see~!)</p><br/><p>With dazzling white skin, one could see the black and gold aura (magic) coated around her. (EN: well, at least it\u2019s censored)</p><br/><p>As if whispering something in dissatisfaction, light enveloped her whole body, and a set of divine jet-black clothes appeared.</p><br/><p>It was different from matter creation, a part of her body was modified and turned into armor.</p><br/><p>By using the Energy that overflowed from her body, she created that set of clothing.</p><br/><p>Just like that, all the excessive energy was released, and suppressed.</p><br/><p>Visibly satisfied, a grin appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>Velgrynd saw all that whilst trapped in her prison.</p><br/><p>One more strike was all that was needed to break out of the prison.</p><br/><p>However, she completely forgot about that one strike as she gawked at the spectacle.</p><br/><p>Her own brother, the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d Veldora ,against the \u201cDemon Lord\u201d Rimuru; \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d Veldora should have had the overwhelming advantage.</p><br/><p>According to investigations, Rimuru was born from the congregation of magic essence from Veldora\u2019s leaked Aura.</p><br/><p>Since it could be considered an inferior copy of a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d, it would naturally be a strong monster more or less.</p><br/><p>It would naturally be a Unique Monster.</p><br/><p>However, it was definitely impossible for it to surpass its creator, the \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d. If it could, that would imply that it was a being of equal rank to begin with.</p><br/><p>(A coincidence? It can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026by chance, and she was born just like that?!)</p><br/><p>Concluding her thoughts, and shocked at the answer she came up with, Velgrynd needed some time to take it in.</p><br/><p>A monster that was born near a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d out of pure coincidence, and was born with a soul that was compatible with a dragon\u2019s essence, something like that.</p><br/><p>Above all it was a non-elemental, absorbing the elements it took in, she couldn\u2019t possibly accept this so easily.</p><br/><p>Then it could possibly even be called the 5th, another younger brother(?), but strictly speaking it wasn\u2019t a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>And if it was to be classified, it\u2019s something with the ability of a \u201cDragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to recognize this, nor would she do so.</p><br/><p>That thing had to be eliminated immediately.</p><br/><p>That for sure, would also to serve as vengeance for her brother.</p><br/><p>Although things happened, he was still her cute little brother.</p><br/><p>Although she intended to control him as a pawn, for a dragon it would only be for a few insignificant years. (TN: #BestSister2016)</p><br/><p>She did not have the intention to kill him or the sort at all.</p><br/><p>And so, when she finally accepted that he was devoured before her very eyes, Velgrynd\u2019s anger blew away all reasoning.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy brother (Veldora) you\u2026\u2026 HOW DARE YOU!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Breaking out her prison as she roared in anger, the \u201cScorch Dragon\u201d Velgrynd rushed towards and assaulted Rimuru.</p><br/><p>\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>The same time as I finished devouring the \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d, my evolution had completed, and it appeared that I was born anew as a unique species.</p><br/><p>Although it had the fancy name \u2018Ultimate Slime (Viscous Dragonoid Demon God)\u2019, it\u2019s not a slime at all, I thought in secret.</p><br/><p>This late into it, if I think too much about it I lose.</p><br/><p>Now to check out the new body.</p><br/><p>This body that was born without consuming Energy had a greatly increased capacity.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, the body that once looked around 12 years old, now looked around the age of 16.</p><br/><p>This feeling of growth felt interesting, but for me who could freely modify my age this wasn\u2019t anything of significance.</p><br/><p>Well, in regard to Energy usage, as long as I\u2019m able to move about in my relaxed state then there were no problems.</p><br/><p>My slime form probably had an increase in mass. I might even have a diameter of 70~80cm now.</p><br/><p>I should confirm that later.</p><br/><p>And so, I was currently not wearing anything. In other words, I\u2019m naked.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s no good.</p><br/><p>A strange aura has leaked out, covering my body\u2015\u2015Even though I didn\u2019t have any reproductive organs as usual\u2015\u2015however, from my own ethical point of view this was something unfavorable.</p><br/><p>(TN: aka, there\u2019s neither hole or pole down there\u2026god this sounds so wrong\u2026.)</p><br/><p>And so, I produced some clothes.</p><br/><p>Using the matter creation ability from Diablo and the other demons, I used my Aura, and created clothes.</p><br/><p>This also had some defensive capabilities to a certain extent. If the creator\u2019s own body is used, it would have a complementary performance.</p><br/><p>In an instant, my body felt like it was garbed in clothing. It felt very pleasant; it was a set of cool black</p><br/><p>garbs.</p><br/><p>The performance was\u2026\u2026God tier.</p><br/><p>God tier? God tier was it ~ I see\u2026\u2026wait, Huh?!</p><br/><p>This was what it meant to be shocked stupid.</p><br/><p>In other words, the part of my body \u2015\u2015the flesh of my main body\u2015\u2015had this kind of ridiculous defensive capability.</p><br/><p>I felt like I had evolved, I see, indeed.</p><br/><p>One reason may be that several of my subordinates were awakening into Demon Lords, and their abilities were gather via \u300eFood Chain\u300f.</p><br/><p>Coming here, I felt like I had awakened a whole lot more.</p><br/><p>Well, since my body was rebuilt into a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d, it was only natural I would have this kind of defensive capability.</p><br/><p>This was all the result of a successful operation.</p><br/><p>In short this was all thanks to Wisdom Lord Raphael-san. This was really well done, truly befitting of Sensei.</p><br/><p>\u300aAlert. Not at all.\u300b(EN: *Algorithmically blushes*)</p><br/><p>She may have said, but I ignored it.</p><br/><p>Well, I\u2019ve got clothes now, but I haven\u2019t forgotten my original objective.</p><br/><p>(Veldora, you alright?)</p><br/><p>(Kuahahahaha!</p><br/><p>How many times have I told you.</p><br/><p>Of course I\u2019m safe.</p><br/><p>Or rather look at you, well done defeating my main body safely.</p><br/><p>(It was really intense though.</p><br/><p>But, this is wonderful, it truly is!)</p><br/><p>Veldora and I were both glad the other was all right.</p><br/><p>And so, as proof of Veldora\u2019s release, I heard the voice of Wisdom Lord Raphael.</p><br/><p>\u300aReport. \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d with individual: Veldora successfully re-established.\u300b</p><br/><p>Wisdom Lord Raphael was always constantly working.</p><br/><p>This time too, it was flawless work as usual.</p><br/><p>\u300aReport, there have been modifications to the ultimate skill \u300eStorm King Veldora\u300f.</p><br/><p>Storm Dragon Summon: Summon Veldora in his original dragon form.</p><br/><p>\u203bEnergy required would vary corresponding to summoning delay.</p><br/><p>Storm Dragon Release: Individual: Veldora would be granted a clone to take free action.</p><br/><p>\u203bUpon death, memories could be restored, and releasing once again is possible.</p><br/><p>Storm series magic\uff1a \u201cDeath Heralding Winds\u201d \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d \u201cStorm of Ruins\u201d \u201cStorm lightning\u201d</p><br/><p>\u203bChantless, instant activation possible.</p><br/><p>Bladed Storm\uff1aCrystallization, Transforming into a Blade Core.</p><br/><p>That is all. \u300b</p><br/><p>Alright.</p><br/><p>The first tactical victory condition has been cleared.</p><br/><p>Next came the second and third.</p><br/><p>Eliminating the threat, slaughtering the Imperial soldiers.</p><br/><p>Now that my anger had settled, I started to think like\u2026\u2026it\u2019s fine not to kill them all right~</p><br/><p>but with the Black Numbers rampaging about, it was probably too late.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it was necessary to eliminate the threat anyway.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s maintain our momentum up until the end.</p><br/><p>Steeling my determination, I faced the \u201cScorch dragon\u201d Velgrynd who would attack me shortly.</p><br/><p>Editor\u2019s Rant:</p><br/><p>Gao~!~!

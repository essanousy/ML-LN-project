Do you remember our promise? \u2026 and besides, for all that complaining, you\u2019ve learned it pretty easily.)</p><br/><p>(Of course~! I was just kidding. I can see my surrounding, and I can also hear sounds. Thank you!)</p><br/><p>(Ay. Could have taken more time learning it, though\u2026)</p><br/><p>Well, I should be fine.</p><br/><p>Got scared a bit, but can\u2019t ignore the fact that this dragon has been so nice to me.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he really is just lonely.</p><br/><p>Just from the glance, he\u2019s looks like he\u2019s lost a lot. Kind of like the \u201ccrying red ogre\u201d.</p><br/><p>(TL Note: look up The Ogre Who Cried on google for more information)</p><br/><p>(So\u2026 what shall you do now?)</p><br/><p>(Umm\u2026 I think I\u2019ll go around looking for fellow world travelers, though no harm if I don\u2019t find any. )</p><br/><p>Finding some would be good, but only if on good terms.</p><br/><p>And besides, since I finally can see might as well see the world.</p><br/><p>The world seems so much bigger now.</p><br/><p>No need to munch on grass to kill time anymore.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 this dragon.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t seem like he can even move a muscle.</p><br/><p>And you\u2019re saying he stayed like that for 300 years?</p><br/><p>(By the way, Veldora-san mentioned that you have been\u2026 sealed?)</p><br/><p>(Mu? Ah, yes. I made the mistake of underestimating a small nuisance\u2026 had I went all out, I would not have been defeated!)</p><br/><p>Somehow, the way he announced \u201cdefeated\u201d sounded prideful rather than anything.</p><br/><p>Honestly, doesn\u2019t really seems like sword nor spear, and certainly not magic, can even wound this guy, but\u2026</p><br/><p>(Was he really so strong?)</p><br/><p>What beast could possible be stronger than him?</p><br/><p>The outside world is scarier than I thought! \u2026 probably.</p><br/><p>(It is so. Strong indeed. Clothed in divine protection, the humanity\u2019s \u201chero\u201d.)</p><br/><p>Hero.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m rather familiar with the term from gaming.</p><br/><p>Recently, the \u201cstumbled into the position of a hero\u201d plot line has been popular, but I don\u2019t remember them being so overpowered.</p><br/><p>In this world, seems like they are truly strong.</p><br/><p>(Speaking of, the hero referred to oneself as the \u201cSummoned\u201d. Could the hero have been from your world?)</p><br/><p>(Eh? No no! No one is that strong in my world!)</p><br/><p>(Nay, the world travelers in this world typically hold some special power. That is what serves as the power to etch their souls into this world.</p><br/><p>The \u201cSummoned\u201d most certainly holds some special power. Most likely, holding the one of a kind\u2013unique skill.</p><br/><p>Different from those who stumble by chance, summoned souls are especially strong.</p><br/><p>The success rate is less than 0.03%, but in this hero\u2019s case it succeeded.)</p><br/><p>(When you say summoning, do you mean calling something out with magic?)</p><br/><p>(As you say. It is a three day ritual involving thirty people. The success rate is low, but success is typically met with a powerful weapon.)</p><br/><p>(Huh? Weapon?)</p><br/><p>(Ay. The summoner engraves a curse into the soul of the summoned to prevent rebellion.)</p><br/><p>(What\u2019s with that?! Are summoned people not recognized as humans?!)</p><br/><p>(Humans? \u2026 world travels sometimes complain about that. That type of thing is but an illusion in this world. Survival of the fittest, that is the only truth in this world.)</p><br/><p>I see\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s pretty hard to accept this worlds summoning with my world\u2019s stories in mind.</p><br/><p>(In that case, would the \u201cWorld Travelers\u201d also be treated much like slaves?)</p><br/><p>(That would depend on the person. They have not received the \u201cMonster Warding Charm\u201d\u2013 those that do either live quiet lives or become adventurers, or something like that.</p><br/><p>Truly, among the many foes I have repelled, quiet a few came from another world! Fuhahaha!!!)</p><br/><p>(In other words, forced labor is only limited to the \u201cSummoned\u201d case, huh?)</p><br/><p>(I do not know whether it is appropriate to call it \u201clabor\u201d\u2026 but, so be it.</p><br/><p>I know much about humans, but certainly not everything.)</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s only to be expected\u2026 sorry.)</p><br/><p>Rather, for a dragon he seems extremely informed.</p><br/><p>Anyways, just talking makes him seem so happy, and he answers any question.</p><br/><p>So for now, the dragon and I, will continue or conversation.</p><br/><p>About how he fought the hero.</p><br/><p>About how strong the hero was.</p><br/><p>White skin.</p><br/><p>Deep crimson, small lips.</p><br/><p>Jet black, long hair.</p><br/><p>Not too tall, petite and thin physique.</p><br/><p>And though the eyes were hidden by a mask, that the hero was beautiful was clear.</p><br/><p>A woman.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 was it her looks that got him? When I asked that, \u201cDon\u2019t be spouting nonsense!\u201d\u2013came the angry reply.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>She carried a peculiarly curved blade \u2013 called a \u201ckatana\u201d \u2013 and fought without a shield.</p><br/><p>Unique Skill [Certain Severance]</p><br/><p>Unique Skill [Endless Prison]</p><br/><p>With these skills, and every form of magic, she overwhelmed me! \u2014 so he happily exclaimed.</p><br/><p>I understood the tale but, this dragon, he just loves humans, huh.</p><br/><p>He calls them small fry and trash, but it seems he has never killed any of them.</p><br/><p>At least those that have not earned his wrath.</p><br/><p>That one time,</p><br/><p>300 Years ago, after a certain incident, he turned one city to dust.</p><br/><p>And due to that incident, the hero was dispatched, and Veldora was sealed.</p><br/><p>By the hero\u2019s skill [Endless Prison].</p><br/><p>I doubt I can understand the dragon\u2019s feelings.</p><br/><p>More than it just being someone else\u2019s emotion, in the end, imagination can hardly lead to true sympathy.</p><br/><p>But, at least I can say that he isn\u2019t a bad dragon.</p><br/><p>And hey, I like him.</p><br/><p>So of course I\u2019m no longer afraid of him.</p><br/><p>And so,</p><br/><p>(Okay! So, with me\u2026 no, can we be friends?)</p><br/><p>Ouch\u2026 that\u2019s still pretty embarrassing.</p><br/><p>I must be bright red right now\u2026</p><br/><p>(Wha, what did you say? For the feared Storm Dragon Veldora to become f-f-friends with someone of s-s-slime\u2019s social standing?!)</p><br/><p>(Ah\u2026 well, if you hate it that much\u2026)</p><br/><p>(Stupid! You! Nobody said anything about hating!)</p><br/><p>(Eh, then? Umm\u2026 what will you do?)</p><br/><p>(\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 well, if you insist\u2026 I can consider\u2026)</p><br/><p>Somehow, it seems he is timidly stealing glances my way.</p><br/><p>Had this been done by a cute girl, I\u2019d be very happy\u2026 but when it\u2019s done by an evil looking dragon\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, it is interesting.</p><br/><p>(I insist! Decide! If you hate, the deals off. No second chances!!!)</p><br/><p>(Cho\u2026! Then I have no choice! I\u2019ll become your friend! Show me your gratitude!)</p><br/><p>Phew.</p><br/><p>This dragon isn\u2019t very obedient.</p><br/><p>I also aren\u2019t, so we\u2019re a good fit.</p><br/><p>(Then, I\u2019ll be in your care!)</p><br/><p>(Ay! \u2026 oh, and let me grant you a name. You also give me one!)</p><br/><p>(Huh? Why? So suddenly?)</p><br/><p>(To etch into our souls that we are equals. As humans call it, Family Name type of thing.</p><br/><p>The one I grant you will bestow upon you \u201cDiving Protection\u201d. You still lack a name, so you shall become a named monster now!)</p><br/><p>Mu mu.</p><br/><p>So, I have to come up with a Family Name (one for common use), huh?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not really good at this stuff\u2026</p><br/><p>(Since you are called the Storm Dragon, how about simply \u201cTempest\u201d?)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s no good, right?</p><br/><p>Since it sound good, I simply took Storm and changed it into Tempest\u2026</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s decided! What a wonderful name!)</p><br/><p>He liked it!?</p><br/><p>(From now on, I am Veldora Tempest. And you\u2026</p><br/><p>Shall be called \u201cRimuru,\u201d Rimuru Tempest shall be thine name!!!)</p><br/><p>And that name was etched into my soul</p><br/><p>From what I can see and feel, I don\u2019t feel any different.</p><br/><p>But somewhere deep in my soul, I felt something change.</p><br/><p>That would be something to mention to Veldora, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>And so, I have become friends (or would it be more appropriate to call this soul-mates?) with him.</p><br/><p>(Oh, and before I go, I wanted to ask. Is there nothing you can do about that seal?)</p><br/><p>(Not with my power. If it were a unique skill like that of a hero, then it could perhaps be possible\u2026)</p><br/><p>(You do not possess any unique skills?)</p><br/><p>(I do. But from the moment the seal was placed, I could no longer use any. I barely managed retaining my telepathy\u2026)</p><br/><p>At the moment, the hero\u2019s unique skill [Endless Prison] prison seals the target in endless time and imaginary space; an unpleasant skill that does not permit interference from here.</p><br/><p>Though it does seem strange that the only thing he can do is to communicate telepathically\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like the skill weakens with time, after all.</p><br/><p>Being able to even recognize the present and converse with other creatures all seem like example of interference. What\u2019s unusual is Veldora himself here\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, both us noticed this.</p><br/><p>(Alright. There\u2019s something I want to try\u2026)</p><br/><p>As I said that, I touched Veldora.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cAttempting to predate unique skill [Endless Prison] via unique skill [Predation]\u2026 failure\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>As expected, a hero\u2019s seal is not going to be this easy.</p><br/><p>For but a second, interference with the hero\u2019s skill released a blinding light, but then it returned to normal.</p><br/><p>Seems like for a brief moment, a seam opened in this endless prison. But it quickly restored itself.</p><br/><p>And anyways, \u201cSince it\u2019s also a unique skill, something\u2019ll happen\u201d type of thing will only lead to trouble.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t there anything I can do?</p><br/><p>What to do\u2026</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cSolution. Unique skill [Endless Prison] has been partly analyzed. I shall present the escape method.</p><br/><p>It is impossible for flesh to escape. Physical damage wise, the chance of destroying the prison is 0%.</p><br/><p>With regards to the imaginary space escape method\u2013the analysis proved impossible.</p><br/><p>Analysis in identical situation\u2013imprisonment in an [Endless Prison] is necessary for analysis. Therefore, currently this is impossible.</p><br/><p>The chance of releasing a spiritual body is 1%.</p><br/><p>Should one prepare a host for the spirit ahead of time, and move there in the process, the success rate increases to 3%.</p><br/><p>At the moment, this process is similar to reincarnation. Should the affinity with the host be poor, memories and skills will all be reset.</p><br/><p>End of the report on escape methods\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>\u2026Fumu.</p><br/><p>The chances are far too low.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t look more than flimsy film, this [Endless Prison] skill.</p><br/><p>But for it to be impervious to physical damage\u2026.</p><br/><p>There must be some weakness to this absolute defense.</p><br/><p>(Did hero take any damage? Any wounds or something?)</p><br/><p>(Well asked! Our blows were well watched, and I have landed a few direct hits! But, there was no effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath Calling Winds\u201d, \u201cBlack Lighting\u201d, and even \u201cStorm of Destruction\u201d. All are skills that cannot be evaded, and yet no effect! I gave up! It was laughable!!!)</p><br/><p>And all other similar babble would end in Veldora\u2019s loud laughter.</p><br/><p>Unique skill [Endless Prison] was definitely used to cover her body, if all outside interference is negated, no shield is necessary.</p><br/><p>What a useful skill!</p><br/><p>Unique skill [Certain Severance]</p><br/><p>Unique skill [Endless Prison]</p><br/><p>If you combine these two, wouldn\u2019t you be essentially invincible?</p><br/><p>Definitely don\u2019t want to meet her\u2026</p><br/><p>She should have passed away by now, so should be okay.</p><br/><p>Without a question, she belonged in the strongest class.</p><br/><p>\u203bIn reality, Veldora was also in the strongest class but the Rimuru of the time could not have known this.</p><br/><p>Anyways.</p><br/><p>The escape to host method, huh?</p><br/><p>To escape, a host to transfer the soul to seems to be necessary. It is also possible to escape in a spiritual body, but the success chance is low.)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t really see the reason to mention the percentages.</p><br/><p>If Veldora\u2019s desire to escape decreases so could the chances\u2026</p><br/><p>(Mu? There was an escape method! Honestly, after some 100 years my magical energy hit empty!</p><br/><p>Probably since I didn\u2019t stop the flow of magical energy\u2026)</p><br/><p>(I see\u2026 that would be the reason why the magical energy concentration around here is so high.)</p><br/><p>(Ay. The truly strong monsters also avoid this area. Grass also hardly grows underground. Only some rare vegetation inhabits these caves!)</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>I remembered about the Hipokte Grass.</p><br/><p>In this case, it\u2019s a pretty valuable medicine\u2026</p><br/><p>(Well\u2026 since that\u2019s the case, will you attempt to escape? If you had a place to transfer to, the chances would be higher\u2026 and also, what\u2019s considered a good host?)</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Unfortunately, even if I detach my spirit, to gather the magical energy into a single core is rather difficult\u2026</p><br/><p>By opening a seam in the seal, that\u2019s how this will succeed.</p><br/><p>And a host, huh. That is, preparing a new core and moving there\u2026 reincarnation!)</p><br/><p>This guy!</p><br/><p>I thought that he might be slightly slow-witted, but he perfectly understood all of it.</p><br/><p>How wondrous\u2026 he reached the same conclusion as the [Great Sage].</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s the thing. So, if there\u2019s something I can prepare, should I go look for it?)</p><br/><p>(Hmm. The thing is, I don\u2019t really need a core\u2026 oh, and keep this secret? I am a \u201cbeing perfect as one\u201d. Especially durable.</p><br/><p>I am a spiritual life-form, and thus have no attachment to this body. I merely responded to the wishes of religions and the like when forming it.)</p><br/><p>Again with that incomprehensible stuff.</p><br/><p>And so we spoke untill I understood.</p><br/><p>The result.</p><br/><p>Gather the magical energy with one\u2019s mind, and then form the flesh.</p><br/><p>At the moment, the flesh being bound is beyond question, but the mind also cannot affect the surrounding magical energy.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the situation.</p><br/><p>So I asked if he could leave as a spirit.</p><br/><p>(That is impossible. I would require an offering.)</p><br/><p>Is what he said.</p><br/><p>If he were to leave in this way, he would scatter with the magical energy and cease to exist.</p><br/><p>And, somewhere else, another \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d would be born.</p><br/><p>That is one means of escape, but if there\u2019s no meaning to it if it means becoming a different person.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m at a loss.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t eating Veldora with [Predator] be a better alternative?</p><br/><p>Place him into the [Predator]\u2019s stomach, analyze at depth the [Endless Prison]\u2019s effects and eliminate just them\u2026 could this work?</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cSolution. Target: Veldora can be absorbed with the unique skill [Predator]\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>It\u2019s possible, huh\u2026</p><br/><p>If I explain it, will he consent?</p><br/><p>If this goes on, after a hundred years of isolation, only to disappear would be his fate.</p><br/><p>And so, I explained to Veldora the [Predator] ability and how I thought to use it.</p><br/><p>This would be impossible, however, without the [Great Sage] ability correction.</p><br/><p>(Kuahahahaha! Interesting!!! Of course I\u2019ll try it. To you, I\u2019ll entrust my everything!)</p><br/><p>(Should you be trusting me so easily?)</p><br/><p>(Of course! Rather than waiting for you to come back here, tearing [Endless Prison] asunder and leaving together inside of you sound so much more amusing!)</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Not alone. Together.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it fine?</p><br/><p>With [Great Sage] and [Predator], I\u2019ll continue analysis and seek to free Veldora from his imprisonment.</p><br/><p>And in this stomach there is no fear of scattering and disappearing.</p><br/><p>I think we can do this.</p><br/><p>(Alright. I\u2019ll eat you now, try to break out of [Endless Prison], okay?)</p><br/><p>(Kukuku! Leave it to me! Don\u2019t wait, I\u2019ll pause it for you!!!)</p><br/><p>Okay!</p><br/><p>I made my decision.</p><br/><p>I touch Veldora, and begin Predation.</p><br/><p>In a second, the giant Veldora disappeared from my view.</p><br/><p>That was too quick.</p><br/><p>He was speaking up until a second ago.</p><br/><p>Having disappeared so suddenly\u2026 makes me lonely.</p><br/><p>The skill highly depends on the target\u2019s resistance to being absorbed, but as expected of Velodra\u2013no resistance what so ever.</p><br/><p>Must say, I\u2019m surprised I could absorb that huge body.</p><br/><p>It seems that at the moment, my stomach is 25% occupied\u2026</p><br/><p>Just how big of a space have I got in there?</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cWill you begin analysis of the unique skill [Endless Prison]? [YES]/[NO]?\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>I beg you!</p><br/><p>As if in a prayer, I accepted.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: the Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Title: None</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Techniques: Unique Skill [Great Sage], Unique Skill [Predator], Slime-Specific Skill [Dissolve], [Absorb], [Regeneration], skill [Hydraulic Propulsion], extra skill [Magic Perception]</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance EX, Physical Damage Resistance, Pain Resistance, Electricity Resistance, Paralysis Resistance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

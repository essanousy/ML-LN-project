It was passed down to me when our souls were one\u2026 So it\u2019s yours to begin with, is it not?\u300d</p><br/><p>The spirit equipment bracelet.</p><br/><p>That bracelet which Rimuru made by copying the destroyed spirit equipment and gave to Hinata.</p><br/><p>Because it was linked to Hinata\u2019s soul, upon merging with Chloe it was also sent to the past.</p><br/><p>And though even at the beginning it was called a legendary piece of equipment, it had further evolved by feeding off of Chloe\u2019s power during her travels.</p><br/><p>Now it was a Divine piece of equipment; Chloe\u2019s personal piece.</p><br/><p>Hinata considered accepting the bracelet.</p><br/><p>Indeed, when they were one Hinata was able to use it. However, this piece of equipment has shared many years with its master Chloe.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Hinata who has lost much of her original strength was simply no longer able to sustain the equipment\u2019s summoning even for a moment.</p><br/><p>Thus, with a sigh,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is yours, Chloe. I can no longer use it.</p><br/><p>Besides, this was made by your teacher, Rimuru.</p><br/><p>It fits you better\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata said with a warm smile, and returned the bracelet.</p><br/><p>Chloe took it in her hands and held it close to her heart.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh\u2026 sensei made this? Is that so\u2026</p><br/><p>So sensei has been protecting me for so long\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen I meet Rimuru I\u2019ll tell him that you\u2019re doing fine and holding onto that bracelet.</p><br/><p>So use it. Or is it called a Hero\u2019s personal garb for naught?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks\u2026 I\u2019ll treasure it\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe responded with a smile and nodded.</p><br/><p>Hinata nodded in return.</p><br/><p>The two souls who have fought together for so long would no journey separate.</p><br/><p>Chloe bowed in gratitude, silently opened the door, and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Without a word to the other children.</p><br/><p>For Chloe the four kids are irreplaceable.</p><br/><p>She truly wants to call out to them and throw her arms around them.</p><br/><p>But now is not the time.</p><br/><p>When the world\u2019s destruction is avoided, then she could do it. Then she would finally be released.</p><br/><p>So Chloe will no waver.</p><br/><p>She will not meet with Rimuru and will not call out to the kids.</p><br/><p>For she was yet cursed by Yuuki.</p><br/><p>At the very least, until she was released from this curse she could not let her guard down.</p><br/><p>Meeting old friends will certainly consume time. Though she is permitted some freedom of movement, she should not stay separate from Yuuki for long.</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s three commands are powerful chains binding her.</p><br/><p>Although he is obligated to give her specific commands, she must still obey his orders.</p><br/><p>Chances are, Yuuki is now aware that Chloe has awakened as a true hero.</p><br/><p>Though Yuuki never gives out orders without carefully thinking of the consequences, he just may order her to fight Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Which is why she must move only after considering every possibility.</p><br/><p>Upon exiting Chloe dispelled her spell.</p><br/><p>Though no one has noticed, Chloe has been slowing time the whole while.</p><br/><p>Since Hinata and Chloe awakened only three minutes in the world have passed. Chances are that Ruminas noticed, but did not mention it.</p><br/><p>This only shows how wary Chloe is of Yuuki.</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s destruction was caused by Yuuki\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>The forces in this world have been altered and a resistance force has sprouted.</p><br/><p>Even Chloe\u2019s strength is far above what it used to be.</p><br/><p>(I will defeat you this time! No, this time I will protect it!!)</p><br/><p>She recalled the future where she was powerless to protect anything.</p><br/><p>This time she swore to defeat Yuuki and protect the world.</p><br/><p>She said her prayers and set off.</p><br/><p>She was the one who was called the true hero.</p><br/><p>Having thus been born, awoken, and with her resolve set,</p><br/><p>The Hero Chloe began her rebellion.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>A young lad relaxing in an expensive cahir,</p><br/><p>Behind him is a beautiful elf preparing tea.</p><br/><p>In the chamber of the Freedom Association\u2019s master appear Yuuki and Kagali.</p><br/><p>\u300cHero Chloe seems to have completely awoken.</p><br/><p>Hasn\u2019t she obtained some seriously ridiculous power?</p><br/><p>Though it seems we are still able to control her thanks to the restraints placed upon her</p><br/><p>But we won\u2019t be able to use even half of her power.</p><br/><p>Seriously, nothing is going well.</p><br/><p>Claymen\u2019s awakening failed, Rimuru-san is still alive.</p><br/><p>There should have been more chaos by now.</p><br/><p>What do you think, Kazalim?\u300d</p><br/><p>Clearly amused the lad called out behind him.</p><br/><p>Turning towards the inquirer,</p><br/><p>\u300cYou ask me that?</p><br/><p>Haven\u2019t you already come to a conclusion?</p><br/><p>The plan is a failure.</p><br/><p>Cutie-pie Clayman is dead, too.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way to sow discord among the demon lords now.</p><br/><p>Though we could denounce the Western Saint\u2019s Church\u2019s ineptitude, there\u2019s people among us who oppose that action.</p><br/><p>The countries surrounding Jura\u2019s forest are also moving differently than we wanted.</p><br/><p>The destroyed Farmas Kingdom is being brought back together by a people\u2019s hero.[1]</p><br/><p>He\u2019s got to have some terrifyingly smart friends to have managed things so fast.</p><br/><p>He stabilized the country and reeled in neighboring violence.</p><br/><p>Even the monster\u2019s activity has been stifled by Tempest.</p><br/><p>The Jura Forest counties are enjoying a time of never-before-seen peace and prosperity.</p><br/><p>In short, it\u2019s complete opposite of what you had expected\u300d</p><br/><p>Kazalim replied with a bored expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, why did you choose a pretty girl but are talking with so crudely?</p><br/><p>Is that your type?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t mess with me. It\u2019s cause I am Kazalim!</p><br/><p>\u2018Tis a matter of appearance, Master\u300d</p><br/><p>Kagali suddenly finished the sentence.</p><br/><p>For Kazalim, no, for Kagali these things did not matter.</p><br/><p>Strength was everything and Kagali\u2019s master possessed it. Therefore, all was well.</p><br/><p>Human society despises cooperation and is fraught with grief and death.</p><br/><p>So Yuuki had said, but his plan seems to have gone poorly.</p><br/><p>So he\u2019s mumbling things like \u201cIsn\u2019t the difficulty setting set too high?!\u201d and such while Kagali is making tea.</p><br/><p>Expression and tone aside, mastering one\u2019s limbs was not a matter for a single day.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Kazalim was not a being who understood gender, but was affected to some degree by possessing Kagali.</p><br/><p>One of those effects was to gain a cooking and tea brewing skill.</p><br/><p>So playing her role as Yuuki requested, Kazalim, no, Kagali spent her time learning to interact with people.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2026 for someone who doesn\u2019t fight, you\u2019re surprisingly good with your hands.</p><br/><p>Well, whatever.</p><br/><p>But seriously, to have things go so poorly\u2026 breaks my heart.</p><br/><p>I feel like blowing off some steam\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t do that!</p><br/><p>Actually, do that when I\u2019m not here!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAren\u2019t you crafty.</p><br/><p>So weak and helpless, but sly to the end\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do you expect?</p><br/><p>I, with my\u300eplanner\u300fability, am not fit for combat.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd considering that we use your ability and my wisdom, I wonder how we ever fail!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTrue.</p><br/><p>I have a hypothesis: I fear there is a superior calculating ability at work here\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cReally? In that case it\u2019s time.</p><br/><p>We\u2019re heading east. Everyone will depart from the headquarters\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that fine? Even though we had built such a solid foothold here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be helped. If we don\u2019t cut our tracks now who knows how much we\u2019ll lose.</p><br/><p>Besides, this is not the end.</p><br/><p>We have secured the \u201cHero\u201d who could have killed me\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right\u2026 that is true</p><br/><p>Understood. I will prepare proper personnel to be left behind.</p><br/><p>The rest will follow us east. Would that be all?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. That\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>Though I even had a plan to go Demon Lord hunting and to mess with Saint Church\u2019s Ruminas.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s too dangerous for now.</p><br/><p>And using the hero here would be a waste. So we move\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus Yuuki made the order to evacuate his chambers.</p><br/><p>The ten years he had spent building up trust to rise to this position.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, Yuuki did it solely to advance his goal.</p><br/><p>Now that his plan was facing failure after failure, he had no choice but give up some things.</p><br/><p>Kagali received his order, and departed to make it happen.</p><br/><p>Watching her leave with cold eyes,</p><br/><p>\u300cBut damn, Chloe, to think you would become that much stronger than I am.</p><br/><p>A waste, but I fear I\u2019ll have to order you to never use your abilities against me\u300d</p><br/><p>He muttered.</p><br/><p>That a proclamation that bore the full knowledge of the difference in their power.</p><br/><p>Wearing a smile of utter delight, Yuuki began to think.</p><br/><p>A trump card, but also a joker which could kill him.</p><br/><p>(How exciting it is!)</p><br/><p>He thought.</p><br/><p>Completely ignoring his recent failures, Kagurazaka Yuuki was enjoying the current situation.</p><br/><p>And by thus abandoning the post of the Grand Master and disappearing into darkness, he brought great calamity to the world.</p><br/><p>Thus the bringer of chaos was released\u2026</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>When the kids awoke Chloe was already gone.</p><br/><p>The one most upset at her was Alisa.</p><br/><p>\u300cChloe grew up first!</p><br/><p>I bet the only reason she did it was to get Sensei\u2019s attention!\u300d</p><br/><p>She grumbled furious; the other children were upset for another reason.</p><br/><p>They were upset because she left without saying goodbye, but the three boys decided to console Alisa instead.</p><br/><p>Watching those kids Fritz\u2019s only thought was relief that he didn\u2019t have to deal with them.</p><br/><p>But in the end,</p><br/><p>\u300cFritz, we\u2019re headed to to Tempest. I want you to come along\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata said, implying that he would be babysitting them from now on.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s come to this,\u201d he sighed and gave up.</p><br/><p>But not all was amiss.</p><br/><p>She said come along, so that means Hinata would also be going.</p><br/><p>Cardinal Nicholas cannot leave the Western Saint\u2019s Church. So, this was a chance to make some more memories with Hinata!</p><br/><p>Fritz thought and smiled.</p><br/><p>Hinata who (was? now appeared?) nicer felt even more womanly and truly became an unattainable flower for the templars.</p><br/><p>Fritz could not possible allow Nicholas to monopolize that flower.</p><br/><p>For Fritz who was in his twenties, Nicholas (30s) was an old man. To allow that old man to have Hinata would hurt Fritz\u2019s Templar pride.</p><br/><p>They have already formed an alliance to get ahead of Nicholas.</p><br/><p>Feeling their earnest support (Actually, deluding himself into believing they supported him), he accepted her request.</p><br/><p>Nicholas was pouting due to being again separated from Hinata.</p><br/><p>Oh, and Hinata did ignore the fact that someone\u2019s hand was injured.</p><br/><p>That someone, with a pretty face, was staring intently at Fritz.</p><br/><p>(Fritz, I forbid you from laying a hand on Hinata!)</p><br/><p>(Fufu, Nicholas-san, though you may be my superior here, this matter is one of man to man! I will not obey that order!)</p><br/><p>Ah, well, that\u2019s the conversation they did not have, as they were silent, and clearly cannot communicate with their thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u300cNicholas-sama, what would that injury be?\u300d</p><br/><p>Fritz asked noticing that Nicholas was desperately trying to hide the injury.</p><br/><p>The injury he located as if by smell. Perhaps Fritz developed that skill when avoiding all those attacks from Ranga.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmph! Th-this doesn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>More importantly, absolutely protect Hinata this time!</p><br/><p>Do not fail me a second time!\u300d</p><br/><p>Nicholas avoided the question.</p><br/><p>The truth of the matter is this: last night when Hinata, Chloe, and Ruminas were talking Nicholas was hugging Hinata the whole time\u2026</p><br/><p>Then he got particularly bold and touched her chest.</p><br/><p>With a smile, Hinata crushed his hand. Of course he could not say this to anyone.</p><br/><p>Just when he had intended to use her return as a pretext to invite her to his chamber!</p><br/><p>He himself ruined the opportunity.</p><br/><p>As a child he just couldn\u2019t contain his desire any longer.</p><br/><p>And attempting to hid this disgrace he strongly commanded Fritz to protect Hinata.</p><br/><p>In reality, they will be traveling on a carriage prepared by Demon Lord Ruminas with her hand picked guards guarding them. So there should be no problems.</p><br/><p>But still, Nicholas was worried.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019ll be fine, Nicholas. I\u2019ll be back!\u300d</p><br/><p>In the end, Hinata departed with a smile, and Nicholas could express his worries in no more than</p><br/><p>\u300cBe careful!\u300d</p><br/><p>And the other knights too watched depressed as Hinata departed.</p><br/><p>Thus the kids\u2019 group set off for Tempest.</p><br/><p>The time of the great Saints-Demons alliance would be coming soon.</p><br/><p>But that alliance also signalled the beginning of great chaos.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

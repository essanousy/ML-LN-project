What kind of idiocy is that!?\u2019.</p><br/><p>Indeed, for the past 300 years it had remained a peaceful era.</p><br/><p>Kaijin couldn\u2019t understand. Why would the Empire, which was plenty rich</p><br/><p>enough as it was, go through the trouble of invading other lands?</p><br/><p>Although for this dwarf, who made a living through creating weapons, the</p><br/><p>beginning of the war should have been a really good chance to make huge</p><br/><p>profits\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018But still! Why did my workload have to increase so suddenly!!!\u2019, was all</p><br/><p>that ran through the dwarf\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there was one thing that he was greatly worried about\u2026</p><br/><p>Even as he cursed and fantasized about beating up a certain government</p><br/><p>Minister, the dwarf was in deep consideration regarding another matter.</p><br/><p>[What should I do\u2026]</p><br/><p>He breathed a tired sigh as he continued to think.</p><br/><p>There was almost no time remaining for him to complete his work orders.</p><br/><p>Missing the deadline would be a huge blow to his reputation.</p><br/><p>Saying \u2018I couldn\u2019t do it!\u2019, was simply not an option.</p><br/><p>Right now, his future depended on whether he would receive contact from</p><br/><p>the friends he had sent word for.</p><br/><p>He was well known for his skill as a blacksmith, but there were still some</p><br/><p>things he couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>What was troubling him so much, was the lack of materials to create</p><br/><p>weapons with!</p><br/><p>And then the people he had been waiting for finally appeared before him.</p><br/><p>[Sorry\u2026we should have made it by yesterday, but there was a matter</p><br/><p>beyond our control\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Saying that, the three men entered Kaijin\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>There were three of them, all siblings, and also of the dwarven race. All of</p><br/><p>them were in the business of mining.</p><br/><p>The eldest son Garm. He was a skilled armorsmith.</p><br/><p>The second son Dold. He was for known his first-rate craftsmanship.</p><br/><p>The third son Mild. Though he was a dwarf of few words, he was an expert</p><br/><p>at what he did. Having knowledge in construction, and well-versed in the</p><br/><p>arts, he was a one of a kind genius.</p><br/><p>By all rights, these three outstanding talents should have been the owners</p><br/><p>of their own shops, but unfortunately, they were all rather clumsy in</p><br/><p>regards to general living.</p><br/><p>Blessed only in their respective specializations, they were hopeless when it</p><br/><p>came to planning things or business trades, which was why they were</p><br/><p>frequently taken advantage of by the people around them.</p><br/><p>And so, their shop was taken over by a person they had trusted in, and what</p><br/><p>was more, they even fell into a trap laid by a fellow apprentice who was</p><br/><p>jealous of their talents, and ended up literally kicking an officer of the</p><br/><p>king and was now under watch by the country\u2026</p><br/><p>Having nowhere else to go to, they chose to rely on Kaijin, who was their</p><br/><p>childhood friend as well as the big brother of the group.</p><br/><p>Although he ruefully thought to himself, \u2018You should have depended on</p><br/><p>me sooner!\u2019, he was aware that it was already far too late to say that.</p><br/><p>He had decided to shelter three brothers into his shop and hire them to</p><br/><p>work for him. However, there was no work to entrust to them.</p><br/><p>While Kaijin\u2019s shop mainly sold weapons, his other goods were bought</p><br/><p>from other suppliers.</p><br/><p>Since he personally made his weapons, there would be no problem in</p><br/><p>receiving assistance in regards to that, however\u2026he feared that</p><br/><p>unnecessary troubles would occur if his shop suddenly stopped trading</p><br/><p>with the other suppliers and began self-producing armors and crafts.</p><br/><p>There was a need to continue business operations as usual until the three</p><br/><p>settled down. This was why he had tasked the three brothers with</p><br/><p>overseeing laborers in the gathering of ores and raw materials.</p><br/><p>After hearing their circumstances, he found out that they had encountered a</p><br/><p>demon. Kaijin was greatly perplexed at this. Nevertheless, their safety was</p><br/><p>something to be happy about.</p><br/><p>Thinking of how fortunate the three were to avoid any injuries, he voiced</p><br/><p>his relief.</p><br/><p>[Well, it\u2019s good that you guys are safe! You must have done well in</p><br/><p>running away. It\u2019s great that none of you were hurt!]</p><br/><p>Indeed, as long as they were safe, it was always possible to go back to</p><br/><p>gathering the needed ores.</p><br/><p>But while he was thinking to himself, \u2018The safety of my friends are much</p><br/><p>more important!\u2019, the three brothers exchanged awkward looks with each</p><br/><p>other.</p><br/><p>They said,</p><br/><p>[No\u2026it\u2019s not like we managed to get away in time.]</p><br/><p>[Mhm. To tell you the truth, even now I still can\u2019t come to terms with what</p><br/><p>happened yesterday\u2026]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>*Third bro is silent</p><br/><p>From then on, he listened as they explained what happened in detail.</p><br/><p>They claimed, \u2018A mysterious slime gave us medicine that brought us back</p><br/><p>to life!\u2019.</p><br/><p>Normally, he would have laughingly replied, \u2018I don\u2019t believe that!\u2019, but he</p><br/><p>knew that the brothers were never the kind to lie. Or rather, they just</p><br/><p>weren\u2019t skillful enough in telling lies. Which meant that what they said was</p><br/><p>true\u2026</p><br/><p>However, seeing as it was only yesterday that a demon attack had resulted</p><br/><p>in casualties, hiring new miners would most likely be impossible.</p><br/><p>Due to yesterday\u2019s events, the men he had employed were resigning one</p><br/><p>after another. Since they also incurred considerable injuries themselves, he</p><br/><p>could not really complain.</p><br/><p>In regular circumstances, this would precisely be the time to go to the</p><br/><p>Freedom Association with a request, but that was not an option.</p><br/><p>He had already issued a request for the gathering of ores, but there was yet</p><br/><p>to be a reply. It was the same situation for every other workshop, and so</p><br/><p>the stocks of goods in the market were deteriorating.</p><br/><p>In the case of commissioning guards, not only would the fee be</p><br/><p>comparatively high, they would only work within the extent of the request.</p><br/><p>If you asked for escorts, they would do just that and no more\u2026</p><br/><p>And when it came to the price of adventurers capable of defeating a B rank</p><br/><p>demon\u2026it wouldn\u2019t do any good. Far from making a profit, he would go</p><br/><p>bankrupt instead.</p><br/><p>He thought to himself, \u2018Tsk! Why did such a strong demon have to come</p><br/><p>out in the outer zone of the mines!\u2019.</p><br/><p>Kaijin sighed heavily.</p><br/><p>He contemplated on what he should do.</p><br/><p>The deadline was drawing nearer. He even considered going so far as to</p><br/><p>personally gather all the ores with his own hands</p><br/><p>But no good ideas popped into his head, and time was running short\u2026</p><br/><p>The four dwarves were all lost in thought as they looked at one another.</p><br/><p>And it was then that a strange group came into sight.</p><br/><p>*Returning to slime perspective</p><br/><p>[Hey! Big bro, you there?]</p><br/><p>While calling out to someone inside, Captain-san, now known as Kaidou\u2013</p><br/><p>san, entered the shop.</p><br/><p>In the midst of our conversations, we had become much more open and</p><br/><p>friendly towards each other, and were now on a first name basis. I was told</p><br/><p>that the owner of the shop , the one he wanted to introduce me to, was his</p><br/><p>actual elder brother.</p><br/><p>From the outside, it looked like the kind of small shop run by a stubborn</p><br/><p>old uncle.</p><br/><p>[Sorry to intrude~!]</p><br/><p>*Rimuru greets</p><br/><p>[How do you do!]</p><br/><p>*Gobuta-kun greets</p><br/><p>Saying our greetings, we followed Kaidou-san inside the shop.</p><br/><p>The moment we entered, we saw that many eyes were focused on us.</p><br/><p>[Ah!]</p><br/><p>All three dwarf brothers had exclaimed at the same time</p><br/><p>The three dwarfs I saw yesterday had all raised their voices in surprise and</p><br/><p>were looking over here. They were looking healthy now. Although for</p><br/><p>some reason they were making depressed faces\u2026</p><br/><p>And then surely, as expected, there was a grim looking uncle whose face</p><br/><p>didn\u2019t lose one bit to those of the scary town construction old men. He was</p><br/><p>the owner of this shop.</p><br/><p>Honestly, he didn\u2019t resemble Kaidou-san at all.</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s this? They friends of yours?]</p><br/><p>[Kaijin-san! It\u2019s this slime!!! The one that saved us yesterday!!!]</p><br/><p>[Yeah, that\u2019s right! So the Captain-san was the younger brother of our shop</p><br/><p>owner!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>*Third bro is silent</p><br/><p>[Ohh\u2026! So that\u2019s the slime you were talking about! I\u2019ve heard you were</p><br/><p>the one who saved these guys. You have my gratitude!]</p><br/><p>[Not at all! I don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019ve done that much, or perhaps I might have?</p><br/><p>Hahahahaha~~!!!]</p><br/><p>For one such as I, who easily gets carried away and goes too far, words of</p><br/><p>praise is taboo\u2026because I wouldn\u2019t be able to calm down for the next long</p><br/><p>while.</p><br/><p>[So, why have you come here today?]</p><br/><p>After slightly regaining his composure, Uncle-san asked a question.</p><br/><p>All of us had moved further inside of the shop to talk. And then, Kaidou\u2013</p><br/><p>san began briefly explaining my situation. I also chipped into the</p><br/><p>conversation, when needed, to help move it along smoothly.</p><br/><p>But I must say, this third dwarf brother called Mild-san, he never says a</p><br/><p>single thing! I mean, how did he still manage to actually communicate? It</p><br/><p>was mysterious.</p><br/><p>[I understand what you want now. But I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t think I can be of</p><br/><p>any help\u2026. The thing is, we\u2019ve already received a request from a certain</p><br/><p>country\u2026.]</p><br/><p>He told us that it was a secret, and explained what was happening</p><br/><p>worldwide while withholding the important information.</p><br/><p>It appeared that many countries were feeling pressured by the fear of a war</p><br/><p>occurring because of \u2018A certain fool somewhere!\u2019, and that was why craft</p><br/><p>orders for weapons and armors were being issued everywhere. Putting this</p><br/><p>information into consideration, it made sense that the medicines and other</p><br/><p>goods were out of stock yesterday.</p><br/><p>[And so, about the request I received. Although I did manage to make 200</p><br/><p>steel spears overnight\u2026but on the other hand, regarding the main order of</p><br/><p>20 swords, not even a single one has been made yet. I don\u2019t have the</p><br/><p>materials, you see\u2026]</p><br/><p>Despite hanging his head low, Uncle-san still grumbled.</p><br/><p>[If it can\u2019t be done, isn\u2019t it fine to cancel the order?]</p><br/><p>It was a reasonable question, asked by Kaidou-san.</p><br/><p>[You idiot! Even I told them from the beginning that it was unreasonable!</p><br/><p>\u2026but then that sh*tty government Minister Bester butted in and said\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eFamed throughout our kingdom for your skills, can not a man of your</p><br/><p>caliber, Kaijin, complete a small task of this degree?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026is the kind of drivel he prattled on to me!!! Not to mention, this was said</p><br/><p>in front of the king! Would you forgive him? That sh*tty bastard!!!]</p><br/><p>He was furious the whole time he talked.</p><br/><p>As we continued to converse, I learned that in the past, the third dwarf</p><br/><p>brother Mild-san had rejected a request from Minister Bester to build a</p><br/><p>house that he wanted. Bearing a grudge from that incident, the Minister had</p><br/><p>repeatedly harassed Mild-san to the point where he was starting to think</p><br/><p>about escaping from the country. And I was told that the one who took him</p><br/><p>in at that time was Kaijin-san.</p><br/><p>However you looked at it, it was definitely an unjustified resentment</p><br/><p>towards Mild-san.</p><br/><p>Then I thought to myself, \u2018Wasn\u2019t it likely that the Minister bought up all</p><br/><p>the materials to obstruct Kaijin-san\u2019s work?\u2019.</p><br/><p>[If you couldn\u2019t make the swords due to the lack of materials, does that</p><br/><p>mean that spears require different materials?]</p><br/><p>And to my question Kajin-san replied,</p><br/><p>[Yeah. The swords require a special material called \u201cmagic ore\u201d. The</p><br/><p>spears only needed to be made out of steel.]</p><br/><p>He had replied in a very tired manner</p><br/><p>Without the materials, even a master blacksmith was just an ordinary</p><br/><p>person. It must be so frustrating for him.</p><br/><p>But when you think about it, wasn\u2019t it possible that the Minister was</p><br/><p>waiting for Kaijin-san to come to him begging for help?</p><br/><p>[To top it off\u2026it takes a whole day to complete one sword. Even by using</p><br/><p>the assembly -line system for efficient production, it would still take 2</p><br/><p>weeks to make 20 of them\u2026.]</p><br/><p>I was about to ask about the time limit, but then decided not to. The despair</p><br/><p>on his face told me everything I needed to know.</p><br/><p>But he told me anyway.</p><br/><p>[The deadline is by this weekend\u2026. On the first day of next week, I have to</p><br/><p>deliver it all to the King. This job is something that is assigned to each and</p><br/><p>every craftsman, commissioned by the country\u2026if you can\u2019t complete it,</p><br/><p>it is possible to have your qualifications as a craftsman revoked\u2026]</p><br/><p>In other words, only 5 or so days left to complete the order. Or rather,</p><br/><p>since any progress couldn\u2019t be made today, then only 4 days until the</p><br/><p>deadline?</p><br/><p>I got the feeling like the talk was getting serious. I had nothing to do with</p><br/><p>this, so why was I here?</p><br/><p>Just wait a moment, I can\u2019t seem to understand what\u2019s going on~?</p><br/><p>Actually, if it\u2019s \u201cmagic ores\u201d, don\u2019t I have some? Well, it\u2019s not like it was</p><br/><p>my business\u2026</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know if they were misunderstanding something or not, but</p><br/><p>everyone was looking towards me. Being stared at by men doesn\u2019t make</p><br/><p>me happy!</p><br/><p>Their eyes seemed to be telling me, \u2018Hey you! Can\u2019t you do something</p><br/><p>about this?\u2019.</p><br/><p>These people\u2026what did they think a slime was capable of?</p><br/><p>Guess I\u2019ve got no choice.</p><br/><p>For now, I should magnanimously lend my help them\u2026And while I\u2019m at</p><br/><p>that, I\u2019ll have them assist me with the revival of our goblin village!</p><br/><p>[Fufufu. Hahaha. Ha~~~hahaha!!! Hey now, isn\u2019t this talk just too</p><br/><p>insignificant? Uncle! This thing, can you use it?]</p><br/><p>With a loud thud, I placed before their very eyes, a fully extracted ore on</p><br/><p>the work table. And then I went to lay down on the sofa with my legs</p><br/><p>outstretched! (That\u2019s how I imagined it)</p><br/><p>[\u2026He, hey! Heeeey!!! Thi-, isn\u2019t this \u201cmagic ore\u201d!? Moreover, its of</p><br/><p>unbelievably high purity!!!]</p><br/><p>Heh. Actually, that wasn\u2019t \u201cmagic ore\u201d.</p><br/><p>It was a premade \u201cmagic steel ingot\u201d~!!!.</p><br/><p>[Hey now, uncle, are your eyes just for show?]</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t even capable of identifying this, I doubted he would be of any</p><br/><p>use to me.</p><br/><p>I would sell the material to him at a suitable price, but wouldn\u2019t further</p><br/><p>involve myself!</p><br/><p>[What\u2026? \u2026You don\u2019t mean\u2026no, that\u2019s ridiculous! Are you saying that</p><br/><p>the whole of this ingot is \u201cmagic steel\u201d!?]</p><br/><p>As expected, Uncle-san saw through it! But still, like how he was</p><br/><p>astonished, I was pleasantly surprised as well!</p><br/><p>[Wi-, will you turn this over to me? Of course, I\u2019ll pay the asking price!]</p><br/><p>Fufufu. I caught him!</p><br/><p>[Well now, how should I go about this~]</p><br/><p>[Argh. What is it you want? I\u2019ll do anything that is within my ability!]</p><br/><p>[I was waiting for those words! You\u2019ve already heard of our</p><br/><p>circumstances, yes? Among uncle-san\u2019s acquaintances, I want you to find</p><br/><p>someone capable of teaching crafting techniques.]</p><br/><p>[What did you say? You\u2019re okay with just that?]</p><br/><p>[Hmph. Our first priority is to secure the life necessities, clothing and</p><br/><p>housing! And also from now on, I want to request an intermediary for</p><br/><p>supplying clothes, and someone capable of making weapons.]</p><br/><p>[If that\u2019s all you need, there\u2019ll be no problem at all!]</p><br/><p>With this agreement, I handed over the \u201cmagic steel ingot\u201d to Uncle-san,</p><br/><p>Kaijin, and in return I gained a promise.</p><br/><p>We planned to go over the smaller details after he completed his work</p><br/><p>orders.</p><br/><p>From the response he showed, it would have most likely been fine to</p><br/><p>request a little more, but wanting too much wasn\u2019t good.</p><br/><p>After all\u2026greed was always the cause of my failures!</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve learned from my past mistakes.</p><br/><p>The very same day, after everyone had dinner, Kaidou-san left us and</p><br/><p>returned to his post.</p><br/><p>Even though he was captain of the guards, it wasn\u2019t a good example he was</p><br/><p>setting by skipping his work from noon. But well, it was for the sake of</p><br/><p>guiding me around. I have nothing to say about that!</p><br/><p>And then, the three dwarf brothers had excessively expressed their thanks</p><br/><p>to me.</p><br/><p>It appeared, that because they thought it was their fault that Uncle-san</p><br/><p>(Kaijin) was under supervision of the country, they felt very grateful that I</p><br/><p>helped out.</p><br/><p>When I asked, \u2018If you like, why don\u2019t you three join us?\u2019, their eyes went</p><br/><p>wide with surprise, and then they began a discussion among themselves.</p><br/><p>Well, I was sure they would arrive to some sort of conclusion.</p><br/><p>But it was about time to ask the most important question.</p><br/><p>[Uncle-san, there are 4 remaining days. Including today, that makes it 4.5</p><br/><p>days. Will it be enough time to finish your work?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026. To be honest, I don\u2019t think it can be done. Even so, I\u2019ve no choice but</p><br/><p>to do it!]</p><br/><p>So he was planning on going ahead with only fighting spirit\u2026.</p><br/><p>However, I know this. What can\u2019t be done, can\u2019t be done!</p><br/><p>To be successful in something, all the components that makes it possible</p><br/><p>must be assembled.</p><br/><p>There was nothing to be done about it\u2026since I started this, I\u2019ll see it</p><br/><p>through to the end!</p><br/><p>[I understand. I have a plan! For the time being, wait until tomorrow. I need</p><br/><p>you to calm down and make me one sword that is of the finest quality</p><br/><p>possible!]</p><br/><p>[What are you saying? Aren\u2019t you an amateur in this? What can you do to</p><br/><p>help?]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a secret. Believe in me! If you can\u2019t, then do as you like. However, I\u2019m</p><br/><p>sure that you won\u2019t be able to fulfill the request!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 It\u2019s okay to trust in you, right? In the case that you can\u2019t make this</p><br/><p>succeed, I won\u2019t be paying you for the \u201cmagic steel\u201d. Well, it wouldn\u2019t</p><br/><p>make a difference to me either way, since I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay</p><br/><p>anyway!</p><br/><p>But, if you manage to keep your promise\u2026I swear to keep my side of the</p><br/><p>promise as well! I\u2019ll prepare for you the best workers there is!!!]</p><br/><p>We\u2019ve made our promises!</p><br/><p>And a promise made was something to be kept!</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: Crest of Storm</p><br/><p>Titles: \u201cOne Who Controls Demons\u201d</p><br/><p>Magic:</p><br/><p>None</p><br/><p>Skills:</p><br/><p>Unique Skill \u300eGreat Sage\u300f</p><br/><p>Unique Skill \u300ePredator\u300f</p><br/><p>Slime Inherent Skills \u300eDissolution, Absorption, Self-Regeneration\u300f</p><br/><p>Extra Skill \u300eWater Manipulation\u300f</p><br/><p>Extra Skill \u300eMagic Perception\u300f</p><br/><p>Acquired Skills:</p><br/><p>Black Snake \u300eHeat Perception, Poison Mist Breath\u300f</p><br/><p>Centipede \u300eParalysis Breath\u300f</p><br/><p>Spider \u300eSticky Thread, Steel Thread\u300f</p><br/><p>Bat \u300eUltrasonic Waves\u300f</p><br/><p>Lizard \u300eBody Armor\u300f</p><br/><p>Black Wolf \u300eSuper Olfaction, Thought Transmission, Intimidation,</p><br/><p>Shadow Movement, Black Lightning\u300f</p><br/><p>Resistances:</p><br/><p>Heat Fluctuation Resistance EX</p><br/><p>Physical Attack Resistance</p><br/><p>Pain Immunity</p><br/><p>Electrical Resistance</p><br/><p>Paralysis Resistance</p><br/>\n</div>"}

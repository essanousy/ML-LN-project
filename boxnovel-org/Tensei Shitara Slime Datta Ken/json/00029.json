We\u2019ll crush them!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Head was full of confidence.</p><br/><p>Had they fought on the plains it might have been different, especially considering the Lizardmen\u2019s were outnumbered,</p><br/><p>But this battle would be on their terms.</p><br/><p>If they set traps and proceed carefully, they were sure to win.</p><br/><p>While sending some to prepare for battle, he also sent a reconnaissance team to investigate the orcs.</p><br/><p>Knowing the size of the enemy is a must.</p><br/><p>Along with becoming the leader, his intelligence increased.</p><br/><p>The carnivorous Lizardmen would individually rank as a C+ monster.</p><br/><p>The warriors could reach B-, and some special individuals among them could even reach B rank.</p><br/><p>The total number of their troops numbered ten thousand\u2013if calling half of their entire population to arms.</p><br/><p>However, even so, their abilities are rather highly ranked.</p><br/><p>If they properly cooperate and fight as a single unit, they can easily rival the army of a small human country.</p><br/><p>Thus, this battle seems completely to their advantage.</p><br/><p>There is no way we will lose! So thought their head.</p><br/><p>However, his heart was still heavy.</p><br/><p>Orcs were typically a race that wouldn\u2019t attack those stronger than themselves.</p><br/><p>And by no means are Lizardmen weaker.</p><br/><p>Had they attacked the goblins, then it would\u2019ve made some sense\u2026 but why them?</p><br/><p>And thus the question slowly grew into unease that tormented him.</p><br/><p>A bold personality, but with enough humility. That was the Head of the Lizardmen who ruled them carefully for many years.</p><br/><p>And this lizard\u2019s fears were soon to come true.</p><br/><p>That much was confirmed but the reconnaissance team.</p><br/><p>The orcs numbered 200 thousand!!!</p><br/><p>Impossible!\u2026 so he thought.</p><br/><p>The orcs were indeed a race bursting with life, renown for their reproductive abilities. However, even then, to prepare 200 thousand warriors was unthinkable.</p><br/><p>How were they able to procure enough food?</p><br/><p>Who had united that many selfish and greedy orcs under one banner?</p><br/><p>With their power, at most a thousand would follow\u2026</p><br/><p>The best the head could do would be raise an army for twenty thousand.</p><br/><p>Are they divided into sections controlled by some outstanding individuals?</p><br/><p>But even so, someone has to unite the leaders\u2026</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t have been\u2026</p><br/><p>The mere thought evoked fear.</p><br/><p>He wanted to reject that thought with all his might.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how terrifying that existence was. The\u2026 Orc Lord, said to be born once in many hundreds of years!</p><br/><p>However, no matter how hard he thought, only that entity could have achieved such results.</p><br/><p>If\u2026 if the Orc Lord has indeed been born, then the advantage he so depended on would probably be meaningless.</p><br/><p>If they fight normally, defeat is almost inevitable. They don\u2019t have enough troops!</p><br/><p>So the Head thought.</p><br/><p>What could they do to escape from this predicament?</p><br/><p>If his worries proved mistaken, he would only jump for joy. However, one has to prepare for any circumstance before the decisive battle.</p><br/><p>So he decided to call for reinforcements.</p><br/><p>And thus he sent one of his subordinates.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was that subordinate that caused the chaos.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Lizardmen\u2019s Raid Leader Gabil, upon receiving the orders from the head, left the marshes.</p><br/><p>Taking with him a hundred warriors.</p><br/><p>Gabil was not pleased.</p><br/><p>To him, who had a name, to be taking orders from a the nameless head\u2026 how revolting!</p><br/><p>I am a chosen one! That very fact was the root of Gabil\u2019s pride and confidence.</p><br/><p>A certain devil he had met granted him this name.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou show promise! Someday, I\u2019ll come back to call you to my side!\u300d</p><br/><p>So the great devil told him.</p><br/><p>He remembers those words as if they were said yesterday.</p><br/><p>My great master, the devil Gelmudo himself bestowed this name upon me!</p><br/><p>So how could I be satisfied working under those low class lizardmen and their pathetic leader?</p><br/><p>For Gelmudo-sama\u2019s sake, I must take control of the lizardmen\u2026</p><br/><p>Gabil kept thinking the same thing: is this fine? Of course not!</p><br/><p>In that case, what should he do?</p><br/><p>The orders from the Head were to journey to the goblins\u2019 village and to request their assistance.</p><br/><p>He did allow some forceful coercion, but strictly forbid any action that would prompt a violent response.</p><br/><p>Pathetic! So thought Gabil.</p><br/><p>We should just conquer the goblins! We should have some faith in our abilities, and all will go as planned!</p><br/><p>Yes!</p><br/><p>We have no need for the weak head who overestimates the power of some lowly orcs!</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this the chance for take over that I was waiting for?</p><br/><p>It is. So\u2013how should I proceed?</p><br/><p>Those lowly goblins can at least serve as meat shields. So let\u2019s gather them up and put those lowlifes to use.</p><br/><p>Ten thousand goblins should be useful.</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026 I got a better idea.</p><br/><p>This is the perfect opportunity to show the world our power!</p><br/><p>My power!</p><br/><p>For that goal, I should proceed carefully here.</p><br/><p>Carefully, without letting my guard down, wait for the right timing.</p><br/><p>First, gather forces.</p><br/><p>This Gabil will proceed onward to the Goblin village!</p><br/><p>For the sake of my great ambition!</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>The goblin village chiefs gathered with paled faces.</p><br/><p>Compared to before, their numbers significantly dwindled.</p><br/><p>It all began with the coming of the fang wolves.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps it began when they abandoned the village of the Named warrior.</p><br/><p>The villages which wanted to fight along that seemingly despondent village have now joined it.</p><br/><p>A savior appeared in that village.</p><br/><p>A being with unbelievable power.</p><br/><p>Those goblins came under the protection of that being, gained new powers, and successfully reconstructed their village.</p><br/><p>But the goblin chiefs can\u2019t do something as shameless as request to join them now of all times.</p><br/><p>Actually, a lot want to do that. There are many who already have.</p><br/><p>But if they join them now surely they would be treated as slave. That was the thought that prevented them from making a decision.</p><br/><p>However, time doesn\u2019t wait.</p><br/><p>The orc army has begun their advance.</p><br/><p>A few chiefs have decided to serve the orcs.</p><br/><p>Rather than be trampled down by them, better to promise help in advance, and live under their protection\u2026</p><br/><p>With those intentions, they sent a messenger.</p><br/><p>The messenger did not return\u2026 not all of him.</p><br/><p>The orc envoy brought the messenger\u2019s head, and said this.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuhahahaha! We shall not permit your capitulation! However. If you chose to become our slaves, we shall at least spare your lives! Such is our response.\u300d</p><br/><p>And he leisurely left.</p><br/><p>Yet anger did not arise within them. For they witnessed that overwhelming power.</p><br/><p>That single orc could have slaughtered everyone in the village himself.</p><br/><p>Normally, orcs are a rank D monster.</p><br/><p>Stronger than your average goblin, but not so overwhelmingly strong.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the report, the village chiefs fell into an ever deeper despair.</p><br/><p>They should have chosen to serve under fellow brethren, at least\u2026</p><br/><p>The orc who promised to save their lives also demanded that they give up all their food.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t kill you, but die!\u201d That\u2019s what he\u2019s saying.</p><br/><p>However, even if all the goblins assembled, they would certainly be annihilated.</p><br/><p>The goblins who could fight numbered slightly less than ten thousand.</p><br/><p>Their brothers from the savage regions, those not included in their gatherings, could not be contacted.</p><br/><p>So, they were out of options.</p><br/><p>At that time, an urgent report arrived.</p><br/><p>Lizardmen warriors have entered the village! It read.</p><br/><p>Was this not a glimmer of hope?</p><br/><p>So the village chiefs went to meet the Lizardmen\u2019s Raid Leader; he was their only hope, they thought.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he was a named monster! Surely he would become their savior.</p><br/><p>And then, their messiah proclaimed</p><br/><p>\u300cSwear your loyalty to me! If you do, I promise you a bright future!\u300d</p><br/><p>We believe those words!</p><br/><p>Thus, the village chiefs made their decision.</p><br/><p>It was a mistake of the weak who had no one to depend on.</p><br/><p>There were some who insisted on serving their kind rather than the Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>However, they were greatly outnumbered, so the goblins chose to serve Gabil.</p><br/><p>If only they knew that this decision would decide their fate\u2026</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Hakurou is a master swordsman.</p><br/><p>Strength without a blemish.</p><br/><p>Although he\u2019s at the age to be someone\u2019s grandpa, his spirit is clearly years younger.</p><br/><p>Having taken my human form, I am learning the sword from him.</p><br/><p>Although I haven\u2019t held a sword since those kendo lessons in middle school\u2026</p><br/><p>My perception speed is a thousand times the norm!</p><br/><p>Receiving a blow is a piece of cake!</p><br/><p>I also had a time when I had thought that.</p><br/><p>Since moving around in the child form was unpleasant, I changed to my adult version.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me, gramps!\u201d I thought, watching Hakurou.</p><br/><p>Then he somehow grew hazy. At that moment.</p><br/><p>*Supaaaaan!*</p><br/><p>He landed a hit square on the top of my helmet.</p><br/><p>I felt no pain nor took any damage. The helmet was made from wood, so didn\u2019t offer any protection.</p><br/><p>Since the point is to learn these movements, it\u2019s best to hear when a hit lands.</p><br/><p>But, really\u2026</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t speed; it was skill. Completely a difference of skill.</p><br/><p>His ability is probably higher than mine.</p><br/><p>How unexpected.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t planning on being conceited, but this completely took me by surprise.</p><br/><p>So this is a swordsman! A power one can easily recognize.</p><br/><p>Had this been an actual fight, well I have a few tricks of my own, but if this were a surprise attack, I would have lost.</p><br/><p>Though even knowing this much, any mistake will certainly lead to my defeat.</p><br/><p>Besides, there\u2019s no way Hakurou has gone all out there.</p><br/><p>Next to me, Benimaru has been knocked out (with a pleased expression?).</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t have the accelerated perception, I surely would have been in the same state. Not something to laugh about at all.</p><br/><p>Two of us taken out at the same time.</p><br/><p>Since this old man regained his youthful spirit he became truly dangerous.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>*Karan, karan, karan, karan!!!!*</p><br/><p>A strange sound resounded from the surrounding.</p><br/><p>What is that?</p><br/><p>That noise, apparently, was an alarm system the goblins had set up.</p><br/><p>Of course, they\u2019ve done that without my knowledge. Using the traps I had previously set as a clue.</p><br/><p>Ending our practice, we head over to Rigurdo.</p><br/><p>When he sees me, Rigurdo rushes over.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere is trouble, Rimuru-sama! The Lizardmen\u2019s messanger has arrived!!\u300d</p><br/><p>So he impatiently reported.</p><br/><p>By the way, Rigurdo has pretty much established this panicky image, hasn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>That aside\u2026 Lizardmen?</p><br/><p>Sigh\u2026 I knew that annoyance would arrive someday, but seems like its finally here.</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s calmly listen like I always do!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Corner</p><br/><p>Clown: I usually try to avoid commenting about the chapter, but I feel this is necessary\u2026 Let\u2019s offer a moment of silence for Gabil. A prayer, anyone?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

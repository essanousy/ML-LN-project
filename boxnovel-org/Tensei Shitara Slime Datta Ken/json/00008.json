The corpse of an identified Pierrot had been found without a suicide note. The police are investigating this as a homicide by a certain Clown.</p><br/><p>Clown: No they aren\u2019t! And you aren\u2019t dead!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: You killjoy. I thought this might be an interesting way to start.</p><br/><p>Clown: Well, it\u2019s not. Don\u2019t be deceiving our readers like that. If we even have any\u2026</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Alright, how about this one? Waking up one morning, Pierrot has suddenly realized that she had started to change into a cockroach. What a shocking Metamorph*sis!</p><br/><p>Clown: We\u2019ll get shut down due to plagiarism! And why Kafka?!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Well, you know\u2026 giant cockroach, Rimuru being afraid of cockroaches.. thought it might be a good setting.</p><br/><p>Clown: *Sigh* What am I going to do with you?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Have my words inspire you to tell some crappy joke?</p><br/><p>Clown: Right! Speaking of bugs, have you heard this one? There was this guy who had a pet centipede. One day, he said, \u201cgo get the paper, and make it snappy!\u201d Half an hour later, he goes outside, sees the centipede and says, \u201cdidn\u2019t I say to make it snappy\u201d? The centipede replies, \u201cI had to put on my shoes!\u201d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Empowerment Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 08 \u2013 The Power in my Hands</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a while since I last walked under the sun.</p><br/><p>Not like I\u2019m a vampire who\u2019d melt or get hurt under the sun, though.</p><br/><p>Presently, using my monster instincts, I can sense such perilous conduct.</p><br/><p>However, I\u2019ll often do it even if I know it\u2019s dangerous.</p><br/><p>Nothing to laugh about.</p><br/><p>Really have to better my self-awareness.</p><br/><p>The cave seems to be in the middle of some forest.</p><br/><p>The entrance lay at the base of what you could call a small mountain or a big hill.</p><br/><p>Sticking out from among tall trees, the hill can be seen from afar.</p><br/><p>Regardless of description, it\u2019s the only place from which you can see the sun. The forest is dim in comparison.</p><br/><p>Has that magic circle feel to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cA wise man keeps away from danger\u201d, as they say.</p><br/><p>And so, I quickly left that place behind.</p><br/><p>Since the moment I left the cave, some time had passed.</p><br/><p>The sun has begun to dip towards the horizon.</p><br/><p>Seems like I left the cave exactly at noon.</p><br/><p>You\u2019d be surprised how much I want to align my biological clock with the sun.</p><br/><p>The moment I thought that, it naturally changed.</p><br/><p>Was it really so simple\u2026?</p><br/><p>Right now, it\u2019s 4 o\u2019clock in the evening.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s time for dinner, but sadly I don\u2019t need food.</p><br/><p>I could eat, but since I don\u2019t taste anything, it\u2019s pretty wasteful.</p><br/><p>With thoughts of food, I remembered.</p><br/><p>The monsters I ate in the cave.</p><br/><p>Though I got my hands on new powers, I have yet to put them to use.</p><br/><p>Black serpent [Heat Detection, Noxious Breath]</p><br/><p>Centipede monster [Paralysis Breath]</p><br/><p>Big spider [Sticky Thread, Steel Thread]</p><br/><p>Vampire Bat [Vampirism, Ultrasound Waves]</p><br/><p>Carapace Lizard [Body Armor]</p><br/><p>The black serpent\u2019s [Noxious Breath], for example, I can\u2019t use at all.</p><br/><p>Honestly, when the Carapace Lizard appeared, I had used it.</p><br/><p>And as a result\u2026</p><br/><p>As if it weren\u2019t armored at all!</p><br/><p>The lizard had dissolved before my eyes.</p><br/><p>An extremely gruesome sight. Even remembering makes me want to puke.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s why I avoid it.</p><br/><p>If, let\u2019s say, adventurers had chanced upon this snake, they\u2019d probably be annihilated before they could even cast a spell.</p><br/><p>Hmm? If I were hit by it?</p><br/><p>I hadn\u2019t given it any thought, nor do I want to.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s just say, thank goodness I shot first!</p><br/><p>To be hit by such a dangerous breath\u2026 would be bad.</p><br/><p>But wait, that isn\u2019t something that I want to remember.</p><br/><p>Since seeing scrambled organs and bloody remains of lizards is rather unpleasant\u2013at least for me, I decided to completely forget about [Noxious Breath]. As for what would happen when used as a slime?</p><br/><p>The radius decreases by at least one half.</p><br/><p>If transformed the breath spreads out for about 7~10 meters, without mimicking that is reduced to only one meter.</p><br/><p>Anyways, would you want to see your opponent melt before you? Therefore, this skill I\u2019ve sealed away.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, [Heat Detection] is simply wonderful.</p><br/><p>Living things radiate heat.</p><br/><p>If combined with [Magic Perception], no attack can go unnoticed. However, since humans and upper class monsters may possess some special skills or magic, this is no reason to let my guard down.</p><br/><p>Next, about the centipede.</p><br/><p>Not going to mimic this one\u2013because of appearance.</p><br/><p>The paralysis breath functions the same as the serpent\u2019s one. The range is no different, as well.</p><br/><p>And as I expected, the range decreases to a one meter when used as a slime. But, it just might be a good skill to use during ambush.</p><br/><p>Or so I\u2019d like to say, but if I had to fight an enemy that close, I\u2019d be better off transforming or running. Anything else would result in inevitable defeat.</p><br/><p>The lizard.</p><br/><p>It was absorbed after being completely melted by my noxious breath. As such, restoring the body had proved impossible.</p><br/><p>Anyways, having physical attack resistance kind of makes transforming pointless.</p><br/><p>So I tried to use [Body Armor] while a slime.</p><br/><p>My face hardened.</p><br/><p>As you\u2019d find in some MMOs, I had become a metal slime.</p><br/><p>My previously light blue body had changed color to a bluish silver metallic one.</p><br/><p>However, as I didn\u2019t try receiving damage, I don\u2019t know how good it actually is.</p><br/><p>I did gain a pretty color option as a result, though.</p><br/><p>Maybe I\u2019ll use it to surprise some enemy.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the extent of these three species\u2019 powers.</p><br/><p>The problem is the remaining two.</p><br/><p>They hold very interesting powers.</p><br/><p>You wonder what\u2019s amusing about them?</p><br/><p>First, the spider.</p><br/><p>Right, you all know about the hero who possesses spider powers, right?</p><br/><p>*Hyui!* He shoots out thread from his wrists, leaping from building to building.</p><br/><p>That famous guy.</p><br/><p>[Sticky Thread] is intended to trap your enemies and prevent them from moving.</p><br/><p>However, if I were to use it, could I reproduce his movements?</p><br/><p>Quickly, I put it to the test.</p><br/><p>Aiming at a large tree\u2026</p><br/><p>*Hyui! \u2026 Buraaaaan\u2026.</p><br/><p>Umm, let me explain [Steel Thread].</p><br/><p>[Sticky Thread]? What\u2019s that? Don\u2019t know anything about a skill that hangs you up on a tree.</p><br/><p>And so, about [Steel Thread].</p><br/><p>It is intended to be used to defend against enemy attacks.</p><br/><p>Or when making a nest, it can be used to increase your advantage (build a maze).</p><br/><p>But what I tried was to make one thin thread and whip it at a tree.</p><br/><p>*Pyun! Buchin.*</p><br/><p>It easily cut through.</p><br/><p>And, there\u2019s also that.</p><br/><p>While I can see it pretty easy with my [Magic Perception], it\u2019s actually very hard to see with a naked eye.</p><br/><p>With practice, it might become a dependable weapon.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll practice with it later.</p><br/><p>And last up\u2013the bat.</p><br/><p>I expected the most from these skills.</p><br/><p>[Vampirism] skill? By sucking the target\u2019s blood I can temporarily gain its abilities.</p><br/><p>Not a skill to worry about.</p><br/><p>I mean, [Predator] is simply better. Would it be too presumptuous to consider [Vampirism] its degraded version?</p><br/><p>And I don\u2019t really want to suck blood.</p><br/><p>So after learning all I could about it, I neglected [Vampirism].</p><br/><p>Rather, the skill that caught my interest was [Ultrasound Waves].</p><br/><p>More than bewildering the enemy or causing him to faint, the skill can also pinpoint one\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>In my original world, bats got around using the same ability.</p><br/><p>But don\u2019t miss the main point. These are essentially vocal cords!</p><br/><p>By itself, the skill\u2019s nothing special.</p><br/><p>So my next step became creating the organ necessary for using these sound waves.</p><br/><p>Luckily, I didn\u2019t have to create it from mere imagination and could instead reproduce it based on the bat I had absorbed.</p><br/><p>With this, I might finally be able to speak.</p><br/><p>Tired and exhausted, I continued working through the night without an ounce of sleep!</p><br/><p>\u2026 Not that I need any\u2026</p><br/><p>Three days and three nights of constant research, and behold the results!!!</p><br/><p>\u300ctAke mE To yOuR LeAdeR!\u300d</p><br/><p>Success!</p><br/><p>As for how it sounds\u2013have you ever spoken right in front of a fan, that distorted voice? Yeah, that\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>The rest can be fixed with minor adjustments.</p><br/><p>While calming my excitement, I carefully started adjustments.</p><br/><p>However, I can\u2019t seem to use [Ultrasound Waves].</p><br/><p>I could have sworn I could shoot out sound waves\u2026</p><br/><p>I was going to call it Sonic Blaster or Sonic Buster\u2026</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t I use those?</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cSolution. From skill [Ultrasound Waves], skill [Supreme Vibrations] can be derived. However, it cannot be currently acquired. \uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>Derive, huh? Probably need to have the skill evolve first.</p><br/><p>So I lack enough information to successfully derive the next skill.</p><br/><p>Shame\u2026 it would have been nice to have a skill that when fired would resonate with the target and destroy it.</p><br/><p>To be frank, if I don\u2019t get it myself, how can I expect to be able to use it?</p><br/><p>Seems like I\u2019m a pretty greedy slime.</p><br/><p>Having many abilities is, without question, a good thing. But, I see no need to hurry.</p><br/><p>I should just be satisfied with having restored my voice.</p><br/><p>And so, while trying out various things, I continued down this path.</p><br/><p>Without any direction in mind.</p><br/><p>But my goal, I felt, was a good one.</p><br/><p>Somewhere beyond the forest, there is a city with some nice people with whom I could talk\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, these days have been pretty peaceful.</p><br/><p>In the caves, I was frequently beset by monsters, but since coming out here, I have yet to fight one.</p><br/><p>Just this one time: while I was practicing speaking, I was attacked by wolves.</p><br/><p>\u300cA\u201d?\u300d</p><br/><p>I seem to have threatened them with my voice alone.</p><br/><p>\u300cKyaiiiiiiiiin!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>And they ran away with a miserable whimper.</p><br/><p>Larger than the largest breed of dogs, with a body length of more than two meters, and a whole pack of them\u2026</p><br/><p>What to say? Scared of some lowly slime\u2026 how pathetic.</p><br/><p>As for me, I had no desire to fight.</p><br/><p>Although I could acquire a sense of smell as a result\u2026</p><br/><p>That thought piqued my interest, so I kept an eye out; but no wolves were in sight.</p><br/><p>Actually, there was no monster within a hundred meters of me.</p><br/><p>Hmm? Somehow, it\u2019s like they are fearing me\u2026?</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>Yep, definitely, I can sense their fear.</p><br/><p>Having confirmed that, I felt a group of monsters approaching.</p><br/><p>Before my eyes, a group of 30 human-like monsters stumbled before me.</p><br/><p>Small bodies.</p><br/><p>Crude equipment.</p><br/><p>Covered in a thin layer of dirt, their expression lacked intelligence.</p><br/><p>But, not completely barbaric. There were also a few who wore swords, spears, stone axes, and bows.</p><br/><p>My grey matter (brain cells) quickly saw through to their true identity!</p><br/><p>The famous monsters that will attack adventurers! Yes, Goblins!!!</p><br/><p>How stereotypical.</p><br/><p>And the ones they attack are weak monsters\u2026 so myself?</p><br/><p>But hey, to come with 30 people against a single slime\u2026 that\u2019s too much!</p><br/><p>However, somehow I feel no fear.</p><br/><p>My instincts refuse to fear them.</p><br/><p>Many of their swords had rusted, and their armor is thin. Some have stitched together some rotting cloth.</p><br/><p>Compare: the lizard covered in thousands of hard scales; the spider with feet like sharpened blades.</p><br/><p>The I who have endured those battles, cannot imagine suffering at the hands of these goblins.</p><br/><p>And in worst case scenario, I\u2019ll just mimic the serpent and take out a few.</p><br/><p>As I was thinking these things, one of them stepped forward \u2013 probably the leader \u2013 opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuga. O strong one\u2026 Does You, have any business, up ahead?\u300d</p><br/><p>Huh, goblins can talk.</p><br/><p>I wonder if they can use any of [Magic Perception]\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026 and did they just call me \u201cstrong one\u201d?</p><br/><p>First surround me armed with weapons, and then politely ask a question\u2026 what a bunch.</p><br/><p>I was amused.</p><br/><p>In any case, it doesn\u2019t look like they will attack right away.</p><br/><p>Will my words reach them? I guess I just have to try.</p><br/><p>And so, I tried conversing with goblins.</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: the Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Titles: None</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Skills: Unique Skill [Great Sage], Unique Skill [Predator], Slime-Specific Skills [Dissolve, Absorb, Regenerate], Extra Skill [Water Manipulation], Extra Skill [Magic Perception], Acquired Skills: Black Serpent [Heat Detection, Noxious Breath], Centipede [Paralysis Breath], Spider [Sticky Thread, Steel Threat], Bat [Ultrasound Waves], Lizard [Body Armor]</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance EX, Physical Attack Resistance, Pain Resistance, Electricity Resistance, Paralysis Resistance</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You wouldn\u2019t found a magic item like this that possess such ability, no matter how many records were checked.</p><br/><p>However, It\u2019s not like there\u2019s nothing that comes to mind</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Impatient as usual I see. Well, I can\u2019t criticize others either.</p><br/><p>I will say the conclusion, it can\u2019t be appraised with magic. I let the Technology Department to examine the other two.</p><br/><p>But, I\u2019m afraid that the mystery of this bracelet will not be solved.</p><br/><p>Even so, It\u2019s not like there\u2019s nothing that comes to mind.</p><br/><p>So, the question is\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>You lot, where was this bracelet obtained from? What is the place called?\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, in order to ascertain that, Gadra ask a question in return.</p><br/><p>Gadra didn\u2019t hear about the origins of this bracelet. He only received a request saying to examine the effects of the bracelet.</p><br/><p>Three bracelets were handed to him and he was asked to check what kind of ability it has.</p><br/><p>He only heard a bit detail of it at the time, \u300eThe effect of automatic revival is possible only in a specific limited location\u300f or some unthinkable thing like that.</p><br/><p>When Shinji handed the bracelet, he said that he wanted Gadra to examine it without having any strange prejudice, but Gadra didn\u2019t heard the story in detail\u2026</p><br/><p>The result, it\u2019s impossible to be analyzed by magic.</p><br/><p>Due to its indefinite change of the spirit\u2019s wave, every interferences by magic were obstructed.</p><br/><p>Because the wave of all attributes was intermingled with each other complicatedly, it\u2019s in a state which the specific pattern couldn\u2019t be calculated. Therefore, Gadra gave up and end up asking the Technology Department to deal with it.</p><br/><p>Asking the Technology Department is like admitting he lost and it hurt his pride, but Gadra\u2019s personality was to prioritized gain over pride.</p><br/><p>While feeling frustrated too, he handed the remaining 2 bracelets over requesting an investigation. The results aren\u2019t out yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried appraised it myself with magic, but I failed\u2026 I couldn\u2019t find any clues.</p><br/><p>I thought the failure was due to my lack of ability, but even Shisho too\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The place is the west side \u2015\u2015 of the empire, it\u2019s the opposite end, the \u201cother side\u201d of the Jura Great Forest, or referred to as \u201cWest Side\u201d\u2015\u2015 of the forest,</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the satellite city of the emerging country governed by the Demon Lord, called Monster\u2019s Country Tempest.</p><br/><p>In that city, or at the underground dungeon, the bracelet is an item that can be purchased upon entry into the multi-layered underground structure.</p><br/><p>Then, as they sold it to us, they\u2019ve also given us explanation about the labyrinth\u2026</p><br/><p>We were skeptical at first, but we personally experienced it with our body.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, it has effect to revive even if we died.</p><br/><p>\u201cHohou\u2026\u2026labyrinth, is it? Then, Can this bracelet be used multiple times?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, once you die it will become light particles and disappears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well in this case, you will be outside the labyrinth, and you need to enter again.</p><br/><p>When you paid the fee, it seems you have to buy it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026So this dungeon, collects admission fees?</p><br/><p>Or rather, anyone can enter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. Apparently, the Demon Lord Rimuru seems to run it as a tourist attraction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026Demon Lord, huh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gadra was rendered speechless by Shinji\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>If you think about it, this is too terrible a conversation.</p><br/><p>A Demon Lord is referred as an enemy of humanity.</p><br/><p>The Demon lord is an absolute existence, and it\u2019s wise to go on basis of mutual non-aggression.</p><br/><p>The reason why the Demon Lord rule over an affluent territory is to nullify a Demon Lord\u2019s reason and ambition for the territories of other countries</p><br/><p>Due to this, Gadra is on the opposition position regarding the empire\u2019s ambition to expand towards the west side.</p><br/><p>One year ago, the Farmas Kingdom perished for incurring the Demon Lord\u2019s wrath.</p><br/><p>While the people weren\u2019t directly harmed, but the king suffered a gruesome end, and the country perished too.</p><br/><p>With this incident as the cue, there seemed to be some kind of movements among the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>As for the newly created Eight Star Demon Lords (Octogram), notification was sent to humanity.</p><br/><p>There are 4Demon Lords whom name is known widely.</p><br/><p>Guy, Mirim, Leon, and the one in the topic Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Gadra didn\u2019t know what are the western nation thought about this, but he believe that it was dangerous move to angered Rimuru as he\u2019s a Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>His name was known because he takes too many intensive actions.</p><br/><p>And the important thing is, even though Clayman who was one of the former 10 Great Demon Lords is gone, the newcomer Rimuru has left quite the impression.</p><br/><p>As indicated by that, the west side has an existence that more frightening than Clayman, so is the point.</p><br/><p>Besides, it\u2019s to the point where there\u2019s no survivor amongst the 10 thousand people that partook in Farmas\u2019s military campaign.</p><br/><p>In the case of an ordinary war, when the casualties were over 30%, it would mean this campaign is a failure.</p><br/><p>At that point, they would need to surrender.</p><br/><p>They thought that their life will not be taken if they surrendered because of the rumored personality of the Demon Lord, but the result was a massacre.</p><br/><p>Were they were annihilated without chance to surrender? Or was it because of the subordinates\u2019 reckless action?</p><br/><p>But, the most frightening thing above all might be his ability of impregnable defense that enclosed them and gave them no chance to escape.</p><br/><p>The army well over 10000, if there\u2019s no one survived\u2026\u2026it\u2019s not an event that common sense can be applied to.</p><br/><p>It might be possible if a large-scale spell was invoked.</p><br/><p>Enclosing the whole army, with a speed that didn\u2019t allow them to escape, if it\u2019s nuclear strike magic\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When using that large-scale magic, it would be a miracle if the opponent haven\u2019t deploy any defense barriers while the magic power for casting such great magic was being gathered.</p><br/><p>If such element cleared all the requirement, it might not be impossible for Gadra either.</p><br/><p>Though, this is all very unlikely.</p><br/><p>Above all, the effects on the natural environment due to terra-forming via nuclear strike magic has not been confirmed.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t kill the runaway enemies by some kind of unknown attack nor command a large number of subordinates to lock down the enemy and annihilated them.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s frightening, that\u2019s how he honestly feel.</p><br/><p>To especially wage war against such opponent \u2026\u2026 truth to be told, the higher ups of the military wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid incompetent criticism.</p><br/><p>(I should probably remonstrate to the emperor about this, huh\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>With such a thought, he let out a depressed sigh.</p><br/><p>After a change of mood, he decide to answer his disciple, Shinji\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s about the Demon Lords. Do you guys know how many Demon Lords there are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, is it 8 people right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t it 10 people? No, shouldn\u2019t it be 11 people now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015\u2015Mark\u2026\u2026 they made some changes last year\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gadra sighed, and began his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose idiots civilian employee\u2019s bad habit, they can\u2019t even do an intelligence gathering, I can see them be the first to die.</p><br/><p>There are 8 demon lords. They refer to themselves as the Eight Star Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 It may mean that they have ability that compared to a star.</p><br/><p>In fact, it\u2019s said that the \u2018Newbie\u2019, Rimuru alone has the strength to match an army.</p><br/><p>The higher ups of the military seem to think this remark about Rimuru is just boasting\u2026\u2026but I personally think it\u2019s the truth.</p><br/><p>But, this time let\u2019s put this aside.</p><br/><p>Among them, one of the Demon Lords is called \u2018The Fairy of the Labyrinth\u2019.</p><br/><p>What do you think about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>These words made the three held their breaths.</p><br/><p>Timidly, Shinji state his thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cLabyrinth \u2026\u2026 as in dungeons?[1]\u201d</p><br/><p>So he said.</p><br/><p>Nodding gravely, Gadra took out a copy of a book, and showed it to the trio.</p><br/><p>In the Ulgrasia Republic on the west side, there\u2019s a dungeon known as \u201cDwelling of the Spirits\u201d.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s said that the labyrinth expands in underground or in the air in this world, but the truth is different.</p><br/><p>In a sense this is correct, yet also wrong.</p><br/><p>According to the books, the \u201cDwelling of the Spirits\u201d not only houses spirits, but it\u2019s also the resident of their queen whose body changed from a spirit into a fairy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis queen, is one of the Demon Lords, the one known as \u2018 The Fairy of the Labyrinth\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gadra\u2019s words weighted heavily on the trio.</p><br/><p>In addition,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe entrance to the labyrinth seems to be only located in the Ulg National Park, but has now vanished.</p><br/><p>Not long after that, the Demon Lord Rimuru has identified himself.</p><br/><p>Then, an underground labyrinth (dungeon) was opened to the public after a few months later.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he continued</p><br/><p>By now, he\u2019s convince there\u2019s no mistake.</p><br/><p>As for Shinji and his friends, they can\u2019t utter a denial.</p><br/><p>\u201cShisho\u2026\u2026did you realize that?\u201d</p><br/><p>He barely had a reply.</p><br/><p>Gadra laughed maliciously,</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally! You idiot\u2026\u2026collecting information is the fundamental of everything you know!</p><br/><p>For War, and also Economy. If a person aspire to pursuit magic, it\u2019s all the more.</p><br/><p>Diligence is not enough!!</p><br/><p>And also, one more thing.</p><br/><p>You lot were defeated by such opponent, it\u2019s as expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! Shi, Shisho, why it\u2019s like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked Yuuki-dono. About where and what you lot doing.</p><br/><p>At that point when the answer come, it\u2019s good as naught to decide anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m very sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shinji was ashamed, His face dyed red.</p><br/><p>As a magician, his master had told him many times how inadequate was his information collecting, he felt ashamed that he wasn\u2019t able to realize it till someone pointed it out.</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019s certainly a bit harsh to compare the crafty Gadra who already lived for many years in this world with Shinji whose lacking in sense of tension due to being raised in Japan.</p><br/><p>Anyways, Shinji and co using this opportunity for some serious reflection as well, the information about the 60th floor Guardian was obtained.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a story of a noble-minded Priest accompanied by a great Holy Knight from a long time ago.[2]</p><br/><p>Such people were turned into devil, it\u2019s story that was agreeable even if it\u2019s said that their threat can be compared to Arc Demon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether this the truth or a lie, in this book,</p><br/><p>\u300eThe blade of the Holy Knight Albert, could cut even an Arc Demon\u300f</p><br/><p>So it was written. I\u2019m afraid he was a master of formidable sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his master words, Shinji is fed up.</p><br/><p>(If that so, I can\u2019t possibly win!)</p><br/><p>That was his state of mind. Since he was uncertain, it can\u2019t be helped, if he couldn\u2019t revive he would definitely be dead.</p><br/><p>In the future, in order to avoid exposing his comrades to unexpected dangers, he would definitely collect more detailed information, sworn Shinji.</p><br/><p>However, this decision was made a bit too late.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because, they, have already been caught up in a new crisis\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The door of Gadra, the Imperial Court Magician\u2019s room opened, and several soldiers entered.</p><br/><p>The sudden turn of events shocked Shinji and co.</p><br/><p>But, the situation has begun to proceed, and due to Shinji and co\u2019s late decision, they have lost the chance to escape from the empire.</p><br/><p>_________________________________________________________________</p><br/><p>[1] First labyrinth in katakana \u30e9\u30d3\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9 then labyrinth in kanji .

Ingrasia Kingdom</p><br/><p>The journey to Ingrasia Kingdom proceeded without incident.</p><br/><p>I summoned Ranga, and had him assume a smaller form. He also has fur armor equipped, so there shouldn\u2019t be any problems if humans see him.</p><br/><p>That is, he currently looks like a slightly bigger black wolf.</p><br/><p>Though the road we traveled by was unpaved, it was still considered a highway, so we did see some mounted soldiers.</p><br/><p>Few monsters spawn around here, and there\u2019s little magic in the air.</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t see any powerful monsters. However, the roads were infested, in some sense.</p><br/><p>Robbers and highwaymen, those petty types were all over them.</p><br/><p>But we didn\u2019t even run into them.</p><br/><p>Well, I guess that\u2019s to be expected. What kind of being could catch up with Ranga\u2019s pace?</p><br/><p>And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re running at neck-break pace; we\u2019re proceeding leisurely, but still at least 60 km per hour.</p><br/><p>Far faster than any horse carriage.</p><br/><p>Thus, the journey proceeded smoothly, and we arrived to Ingrasia Royal City in merely two days.</p><br/><p>The scale of the city was surprising.</p><br/><p>Sure, it\u2019s plenty wide, but there\u2019s also a large wall surrounding the city.</p><br/><p>Two gates lead into it, and there\u2019s no way in except for the two gates. It\u2019s baffling to think just how much money and time was needed to construct this.</p><br/><p>We entered the city and marveled at the sight.</p><br/><p>Many tall structures filled the city, but that much we expected; however, the scale of the buildings was incomparable those in Brumund.</p><br/><p>Most were at least five stories high.</p><br/><p>The city was full of brick and wood buildings.</p><br/><p>But more than anything, it was the strict city planning and the white castle in the middle of the city that made me wonder.</p><br/><p>A large lake occupied the center of the city, and a castle was built in the middle of it.</p><br/><p>Four bridges extend from the castle and connect to the city\u2019s main roads.</p><br/><p>This solemn piece of architecture properly conveyed the country\u2019s military strength.</p><br/><p>In short, all I thought was: amazing!</p><br/><p>From the perspective of defense, every important junction has knights monitoring public order.</p><br/><p>You\u2019d have to be pretty desperate to even attempt a criminal act.</p><br/><p>As expected of a city planned ahead of time by the Council.</p><br/><p>I mean, just think of the consequences if some foreign prince ran into trouble here. To prevent such occurrences, the city has perfected its defense.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the guild card I was able to quickly pass through one of the gates; normally, one has to undergo three different identity checks to be permitted access.</p><br/><p>At the first step, they check your identification documents. If you successfully pass this check, you have to go through a thorough body search.</p><br/><p>Then, line up in another line.</p><br/><p>Each point is heavily protected, and the lines are far longer than the one in the Dwarf Kingdom.</p><br/><p>In other words, I\u2019m truly happy that I had the guild ID.</p><br/><p>By the way, even if there are any problems during your second check, you could go on to the third, but you\u2019d be treated as a criminal from then on.</p><br/><p>You\u2019d basically be treated in a way that will discourage you from trying to enter.</p><br/><p>But still, there are many people trying to gain entrance. And so, extremely long lines stretch in front of the inspectors.</p><br/><p>This all proves just how beguiling this city is to foreigners.</p><br/><p>I proceed onward impressed.</p><br/><p>As for Ranga, he\u2019s entered my shadow from the moment we reached the royal capital.</p><br/><p>What? You thought I would just bring him here in the open?</p><br/><p>Of course not. Wolves don\u2019t belong in cities. Even I have that much common sense. Don\u2019t worry.</p><br/><p>And so, after having hidden Ranga in my shadow and spent half a day in line, we finally entered the city.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s amazing is more than its appearance.</p><br/><p>I was able to see a wonderful display of their advanced culture.</p><br/><p>I saw many large gymnasium styled buildings that are used for concerts.</p><br/><p>Busy squares are home to performers and theaters. There\u2019s also lots of advertisements for performances.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if paper is just that cheap here, but you see flyers thrown away on the streets.</p><br/><p>Truly a metropolis.</p><br/><p>I was finally able to smell the air of busy capital after such a long time.</p><br/><p>No way! I thought in surprise, looking at glass buildings.</p><br/><p>Behind the glass you could see products being sold, like the store windows of our world.</p><br/><p>Actually, I guess that\u2019s exactly what they are.</p><br/><p>The only difference would be that the main products on display are armors and weapons.</p><br/><p>The stores that specialized in dresses and such were located closer to the castle\u2014in the high class district.</p><br/><p>But those are not stores intended for the masses.</p><br/><p>You\u2019d have to be pretty rich just to live inside the city walls, but housing near the castle is certainly limited only to the nobles.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s a sign of wealth disparity.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s just how it is. Isn\u2019t it natural to treat those that contribute more to taxes better?</p><br/><p>Thus, after wandering around the city for a bit, I started looking for an inn.</p><br/><p>The city is separated into four large districts.</p><br/><p>The merchant\u2019s district, the sightseeing district, the production district, and the residential district.</p><br/><p>Separated by the castle in the center, a circular city.</p><br/><p>And easy to understand.</p><br/><p>So, I proceeded to the sightseeing district.</p><br/><p>As I thought, I quickly found a section dedicated to inns. There was also a bar in the back.</p><br/><p>That got me excited. However, that was not my goal today.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, I abstained from festivities, and reserved a room in the inn.</p><br/><p>The sightseeing district is near the walls, with various attractions lined up in the streets. There\u2019s also quite a few street vendors.</p><br/><p>Closer to the center is a large building intended for diplomats and conferences. There\u2019s also a school inside, it seems.</p><br/><p>Of the four sections of this district, it is the most heavily guarded.</p><br/><p>And close to this section stands the Freedom Association\u2019s main headquarters.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know where it was at first, so I had asked a knight for directions.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhich one do you have business in? The closest one is straight that way.\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, pointing.</p><br/><p>In that direction stood a large gaudy building.</p><br/><p>Next to it, was a building affiliated with the Western Saint\u2019s Church. A Saint Cross symbol stood proudly on the top.</p><br/><p>\u300cNext to that church?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, the gaudy one. Even a little girl like you wouldn\u2019t get lost getting to it.\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how I learned the way. The Freedom Association seems to have another building, but I\u2019ll head to the nearest one first.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a pretty large building, that can be seen from far away.</p><br/><p>Thus, after securing a place at the inn, I had come to the Freedom Association\u2019s Headquarters.</p><br/><p>Right now I have no business with the church. Actually, as an atheist, I\u2019d prefer to stay away from the church my whole life.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the church considers monsters its natural enemy. So I\u2019d rather not appear before it.</p><br/><p>But who would have expected it to stand so close to the Freedom Association.</p><br/><p>Well, as long as I don\u2019t reveal any of my aura they shouldn\u2019t recognize me for who I am.</p><br/><p>Not that there\u2019s any use worrying about it. If they find out, we\u2019ll figure out the next step then.</p><br/><p>The entryway to the Association is covered in glass. Must have cost a lot.</p><br/><p>Frankly, I hadn\u2019t expected to see glass doors in this world. Just what you\u2019d expect from \u201cWorld Travelers\u201d.</p><br/><p>They seemed to have achieved the impossible through pure will. I guess my own efforts have been lacking thus far.</p><br/><p>What you permit happens, and what you don\u2019t permit doesn\u2019t happen.</p><br/><p>Rather than saying what you can or can\u2019t do, simply doing it is important.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s remember that.</p><br/><p>And, when I had thought to enter, I felt a presence staring at me.</p><br/><p>The doors opened by themselves.</p><br/><p>Seriously! A sensor detects human presence and opens the door. What a useless example of intricate technology.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m surprised they went this far. Considering that the church next door is opened by hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it different. It\u2019s next door!\u201d I couldn\u2019t fathom the reason for the difference.</p><br/><p>When I entered I felt a gaze fall upon me.</p><br/><p>A lady by the door said,</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome! For what purpose have you visited us today?\u300d</p><br/><p>Just like in a hotel. The headquarters are too influenced by them.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I wish to meet with the Grand Master. I have an introductory letter.\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, and handed her the document.</p><br/><p>\u300cAllow me to verify it. Please wait in this room.\u300d</p><br/><p>She guided me to a waiting room.</p><br/><p>The Headquarters are really impressive. The moment I sat on the sofa another attendant brought me tea.</p><br/><p>They really leave nothing to be desired.</p><br/><p>I suddenly got curious, so I asked,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, security seems pretty lax around here; can just anyone waltz in like this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, this must be your first time to the headquarters.</p><br/><p>Only adventurers of B rank and above can enter it.</p><br/><p>The entrance scans your guild card, so people without a proper identification cannot enter.</p><br/><p>Those below B rank, C+ and below have to use the building near the entrance to the city.\u300d</p><br/><p>So she explained.</p><br/><p>I see, so the sensor also had that purpose.</p><br/><p>And the other building the knight had mentioned must be that one, huh.</p><br/><p>So outsiders don\u2019t know about the necessary rank requirements.</p><br/><p>I probably would have been sent here after presenting the letter, but I\u2019m glad I stopped by here first.</p><br/><p>Ranking up to B was also the correct decision.</p><br/><p>While I was thinking this, I heard a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>A door opened and in stepped a man.</p><br/><p>Black hair and black eyes, the appearance of a youth.</p><br/><p>A rather good face, blessed with a truly youthful appearance.</p><br/><p>He could easily introduce himself as a high school student.</p><br/><p>\u300cPleased to meet you, I am Kagurazaka Yuuki,</p><br/><p>The Grand Master of the Freedom Association.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m looking forward to our conversation, Rimuru-san. I\u2019ll listen intently!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, flashing bright smile.</p><br/><p>An easy to befriend young lad. That\u2019s how I met Kagurazaka Yuuki.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p> *Paaaaan!*</p><br/><p>The door flew open, and Milim entered.</p><br/><p>That was the norm, so Frey didn\u2019t react much.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the large mass of energy that was rapidly approaching her could only be Milim.</p><br/><p>When Milim entered, she happily exclaimed with a wide smile,</p><br/><p>\u300cYahoo, Frey! What wonderful weather we have today!\u300d</p><br/><p>She was combing her beautiful blond hair with her hand. Her hands adorned with an unfamiliar item.</p><br/><p>Not a ring. Something enveloping four of her fingers, with dragon images as decorations.</p><br/><p>It fit naturally around her small hands.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm\u2026. did I come too early?\u300d</p><br/><p>She said, fanning her face.</p><br/><p>Since when is she bothered with the heat\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u300cAra, Milim. It\u2019s been a while. You seem in a good mood today.</p><br/><p>Did something good happen?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNnn, does it show on my face? Look at this!\u300d</p><br/><p>She said, showing the dragon knuckles on her hands.</p><br/><p>Proudly laughing \u201cFufun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Frey could only sigh to herself.</p><br/><p>\u300cAra, my! They suit you quite well. Where\u2019d you get them?\u300d</p><br/><p>After deciding to praise her, Frey asked that question.</p><br/><p>While fidgeting in embarrassment, Milim said,</p><br/><p>\u300cWant to know? Should I tell you\u2026 should I\u2026</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026 what should I do\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>And similar pointless lines.</p><br/><p>How annoying. Frey, who had known Milim for a while now, could only think that.</p><br/><p>\u300cAra, aren\u2019t \u201cwe\u201d friends? You can tell me, can\u2019t you?\u300d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing these words, Milim\u2019s eyes opened wide.</p><br/><p>\u300cRight! We are friends!</p><br/><p>Alright. I\u2019ll tell you. The thing is\u2026!\u300d</p><br/><p>And thus Frey heard from Milim about the monsters\u2019 city.</p><br/><p>Constantly bragging and showing off the clothing she got.</p><br/><p>Frey could not hide her surprise at the sight of such a merry Milim.</p><br/><p>Once Milim finished telling the story once,</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, right. Milim, as \u201cfriends\u201d, I have a present I want to give you.</p><br/><p>Will you accept it?\u300d</p><br/><p>Frey said, and beckoned her attendant.</p><br/><p>The attendant brought it in. Lying on a purple cloth, a beautiful jewel.</p><br/><p>And this beautiful jewel was embedded inside a stunning pendant.</p><br/><p>Any person who saw it would recognize its astounding value.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? This is the present?</p><br/><p>Is it okay for me to accept it? Even if I do, I won\u2019t be giving you the dragon knuckles!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim said, with a wry smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry, Milim. It\u2019s proof of our friendship. A \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d gift, as I said.</p><br/><p>Will you wear it for me?\u300d</p><br/><p>Frey said with a soft smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will!\u201d Milim exclaimed with a brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>\u3008Incantation: Preparing Demon Marionette\u2026 success.\u3009</p><br/><p>At that moment, Milim\u2019s smiling face went rigid.</p><br/><p>Something flashed in her eyes, but her consciousness was already gone.</p><br/><p>The dragon knuckles slid right off her hands.</p><br/><p>Seeing this reaction, Frey sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s done, Clayman. Is this fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>She said to a dark, empty corner of the room.</p><br/><p>From where you\u2019d think no one could be a single man emerged.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Clayman. One called the Marionette Master.</p><br/><p>\u300cKukuku. Well done, Frey. I have now acquired the strongest doll!</p><br/><p>Kuuuuhahahahahaha!!!</p><br/><p>You\u2019ve looked down on me as a young demon lord, but to have fallen for such a petty trick\u2026 how pitiful, Milim!\u300d</p><br/><p>With a sinister smile, Clayman struck Milim across the face.</p><br/><p>Her plump cheeks turned red and her lip split.</p><br/><p>Milim, who was normally clothed in many defense barriers, did not have much defense right now.</p><br/><p>A normal girl, no, even lower than a human; it\u2019s natural for her to be hurt by a demon lord\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Kuahahahaha! While loudly laughing, Clayman continued his onslaught.</p><br/><p>\u300cShouldn\u2019t you stop now?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph, it\u2019s not a spell that would disappear with a little damage!</p><br/><p>Considering her arrogant attitude, surely you\u2019ve got a grudge or two against her?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that why you agreed to this plan? No?</p><br/><p>If so, then don\u2019t hold back. She can\u2019t resist anymore.</p><br/><p>Well, she is pointlessly sturdy, and we can just keep healing her when she breaks!\u300d</p><br/><p>His eyes bloodshot, Clayman kicked Milim into the air.</p><br/><p>Contrary to Clayman, Frey was calmly observing.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Clayman. You don\u2019t know, but Milim has an automatic defense mode, you see?</p><br/><p>We call it \u201cRampage\u201d where she uses abilities beyond her body\u2019s limit.</p><br/><p>So if you want to die, be my guest, but don\u2019t involve me in your side. Got it?\u300d</p><br/><p>Clayman regained his composure upon hearing these words.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch. What a joke of a demon lord. What\u2019s with the oldest demon lord. Looking down on us.</p><br/><p>Whatever. If I use her, I can improve my standing among the demon lords.</p><br/><p>Frey, you\u2019re my accomplice. So don\u2019t go thinking you can betray me now!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAra? Weren\u2019t we supposed to be equals?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFool! I\u2019m the one who came up with the plan! You\u2019ve already become one of my pieces.</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t want to die by Milim\u2019s hands right now, do you?</p><br/><p>Kuhahaha! Now that I obtained Milim, you can\u2019t reject me any longer!\u300d</p><br/><p>Frey made an unpleasant face upon hearing his words.</p><br/><p>You are the Sky Queen, the ruler of the skies, no? You wish for Milim to disappear and I can make it happen!</p><br/><p>She agreed to the plan because of those words.</p><br/><p>As she somehow learned that Milim is weak to the word \u201cfriend\u201d,</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGood. Just don\u2019t try to betray me.</p><br/><p>What, you aren\u2019t like Milim\u2013I won\u2019t order you around. Just ask a few favors here and there!\u300d</p><br/><p>While continuing his laughter, Clayman said.</p><br/><p>Now, he has assembled three demon lords beneath him. A power that their council can no longer ignore.</p><br/><p>At the very least, he\u2019s far surpassed the other young demon lords.</p><br/><p>Milim and Frey. By controlling these two, he could perhaps even force the others to follow.</p><br/><p>Then, even the old generation would come to fear him.</p><br/><p>He\u2019ll rule them all!</p><br/><p>After all, he\u2019s the marionette master! He\u2019ll lead them all under that name.</p><br/><p>The next one on the list is Demon Lord Karion. After that, the next would be\u2026</p><br/><p>Clayman was busy planning.</p><br/><p>Frey coldly observed this.</p><br/><p>On the floor, Milim\u2019s dragon knuckles emitted a faint light.</p><br/><p>But there was no light in Milim\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The dragon knuckles glowed in vain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

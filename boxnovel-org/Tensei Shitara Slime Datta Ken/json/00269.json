How is Mondo being so useful?!\u201d</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-672\"></span>\u201cShut up, Billy! I was there as the group leader so it\u2019s only natural!\u201d<span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-674\"></span></p><br/><p>One of the exhausted students was jealous of Mondo\u2019s results and was trying to flare up at him but was put down by George.</p><br/><p>Even after that, everyone was surprised by our group\u2019s high points and kept asking questions on what kind of activities we did.</p><br/><p>The other groups had no other choice but to remain silent in front of my 41 points.</p><br/><p>Although the highest point was earned by Marsha.</p><br/><p>It seems Marsha\u2019s magic helped her earn some points\u2014ultimately giving her 39 points for the fish and 5 for her magic.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t really care about losing in points but I can\u2019t accept losing to a beginner who started fishing just today.</p><br/><p>I mean, sure, I was making fishing rods for the most part later on but\u2026 even still, it seems like there is a need to show her the awesomeness of an expert next time.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>Well, leaving that aside.</p><br/><p>George, Mondo, Aina and Marsha explained in detail about our activities today.</p><br/><p>And after this and that, when we had reached the base, there were 15 tents completed.</p><br/><p>It seems they were simple tents and building them was simpler than I had thought.</p><br/><p>All of them only earned about 1-3 points so you can tell how much they really worked from that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake sure to store stuff which should not get wet, inside the tent!\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard an instructor say.</p><br/><p>They are probably going to use a big tent for a shared storage space.</p><br/><p>There was also a tent for meetings and a particularly extravagant one for the nobles.</p><br/><p>Are you kidding me? That\u2019s unfair! \u2014 it was luxurious enough to make me want to say that out loud.</p><br/><p>Well, I guess it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t really want to sleep outdoors either so it was fortunate that someone had tents.</p><br/><p>The thought of blowing it away by a sudden gust did cross my mind but that would lead to my points being decreased.</p><br/><p>I should think of something to make my tent\u2019s interior better.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\">Translations by AsianHobbyist Website</div><br/><p>While I was looking at the complete tents, the students started preparing for dinner after taking a small break.</p><br/><p>Our group also started working, so I decided to help out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre our groups preparing the exploration group\u2019s portion as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked, Marsha replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026 I do want to but I am not really good at cooking\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, not <em><i>really </i></em>good? You\u2019re nowhere near\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have something you would like to say, Mondo-kun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mondo tried to say something there but stopped after being overwhelmed by Marsha.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-12\"></div><br/><p>Even George was pretending as if he didn\u2019t hear anything and was preparing the stones for the stove. It seems it would be wise for me to pretend I didn\u2019t hear anything either.</p><br/><p>\u201cAina\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it~ Satoru-kun~?\u201d</p><br/><p>This is bad.</p><br/><p>I feel like I might step on a landmine.</p><br/><p>I could spot George on the other side shaking his head so I understood that these two are out of the equation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, just that I would like to ask you and Marsha to gather some branches to burn for the fire, is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be easy~if we combine our magic, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>George told them to be careful and not get out of sight.</p><br/><p>This place is surrounded by hills but the entrance to the forest can be seen clearly.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\">Translations by AsianHobbyist Website</div><br/><p>The other groups also seemed like they were going to gather some branches so these two girls should be fine.</p><br/><p>Normally, our roles would be opposite but since we have magic here, we do not decide on anything with just physical abilities.</p><br/><p>As such, we didn\u2019t pursue the topic any further and started our work.</p><br/><p>After driving away the two girls, I started dealing with the fish.</p><br/><p>As there was no kitchen knife, I prepared it with the small survival knife.</p><br/><p>I could tell that there were no parasite or poison in the fish with my <em><i>Appraisal Study</i></em> but for what it matters, I feigned ignorance and asked them to check it again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, it\u2019s fine! There doesn\u2019t seem to be any problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mondo told me with a lively voice.</p><br/><p>He is probably excited about being able to eat something other than the rations. I have been hearing his stomach roaring for a while now so I could tell how much he was looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then all that\u2019s left is to grill it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I raised my face, I saw that the students from other groups coming to watch.</p><br/><p>The students studying at the academies probably have experienced camping but they don\u2019t have survival training. As such, even if you hand them fish or grass, they won\u2019t know how to cook it.</p><br/><p>I guess I have no choice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

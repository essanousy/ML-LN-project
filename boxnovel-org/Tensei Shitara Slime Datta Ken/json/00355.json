But Veldora had converted some of his energy to vibrating energy.</p><br/><p>Michelle was surprised by this, but she was not so supid as to be beaten by her own moves.</p><br/><p>And so she parried it easily and muttered in an exasperated voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are abnormal. I heard about the bending of the Neutron Launcher during the fight with Karman, but it seems that that was no joke. I suppose I will have to be serious if I want to win\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said this, a black sphere appeared in her right hand.</p><br/><p>At the same time, she raised her forefinger to her lips and sent the signal by looking at Veldora.</p><br/><p>In spite of her words, Michelle no longer had any desire to fight Veldora.</p><br/><p>She had finished inspecting him and had decided that this mysterious man was not from the Empire.</p><br/><p>As for whether or not she could trust him, that was a different matter.</p><br/><p>She hoped he would see her intention\u2014as she turned around, completely exposing her back to Veldora.</p><br/><p>If he attacked her here, well, it could not be helped.</p><br/><p>It was this daring nature that had propelled her to the top.</p><br/><p>Michelle looked at the stairs she had come down, and then she threw the black sphere towards it.</p><br/><p>The black sphere then traveled up the staircase as if controlled by her will\u2026</p><br/><p>And with that, the upper floor was consumed by the flames of purgatory.</p><br/><p>However, it did not affect the lower floors.</p><br/><p>Gravitational field\u2013space distortion\u2013the isolation of specific topological spaces.</p><br/><p>Michelle was utilizing a paranormal attack that gave a glimpse of her power.</p><br/><p>Obviously, its purpose was to prevent eavesdropping.</p><br/><p>As First Lieutenant Hiragi was monitoring from the sky, she had to create a situation where she could cover his prying eyes while making it appear natural.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora showed interest but did not move.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>He looked a little disappointed that it wasn\u2019t an attack towards him.</p><br/><p>Veldora was too thick-headed to realize the meaning of Michelle\u2019s signal.</p><br/><p>The only reason that he didn\u2019t attack Michelle while her guard was down, was because he felt that it was something only a small fry would do.</p><br/><p>Fighting boldly and upfront.</p><br/><p>That was true beauty in Veldora\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>And Veldora had no intention of killing his enemy now. He would stop her attacks with his overwhelming superior strength and wait for her to surrender.</p><br/><p>By doing this, he would be showered with praise from all those who watched. That is what was going through his mind.</p><br/><p>However, his plans were ruined when Michelle did something most unexpected.</p><br/><p>Veldora had been waiting for Michelle\u2019s next attack with an attitude of calmness, but everyone just took it as him not being capable of reacting in time.</p><br/><p>No one could understand what he was thinking\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. So you must have noticed my signal. Now we won\u2019t have to worry about being monitored. We can speak honestly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michelle said. The confusion of the others only got worse.</p><br/><p>What? Veldora thought. But it was too late now.</p><br/><p>In other words\u2014it wasn\u2019t that Veldora was so great, but Michelle had just been holding back. That is what they thought.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Michelle clearly had no will to fight, as was proven by the explosion she caused on the upper floor. And with that, the tension seemed to leave the room.</p><br/><p>All of it was Veldora\u2019s miscalculation.</p><br/><p>Zaza was the first to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are truly lucky! You would have been turned to ash by now if she hadn\u2019t gone easy on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He laughed as he slapped Veldora on the back.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not just Veldora, but Michelle was surprised as well.</p><br/><p>Both of them realized that Zaza and the others had gotten it all wrong, but there was nothing they could do.</p><br/><p>There was no malice in Zaza\u2019s voice, he was just saying what they were all thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that is the reason. Yes, there is no way a mere cyborg could take on the Machinery Four!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, I wondered what would happen when Veldora stepped out. But I am happy that he is alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other adults interpreted the situation in a similar fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, that woman really wasn\u2019t fighting seriously\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? Still, I am impressed with him. Even standing in front of the legendary Bakusenhime would take real courage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. It\u2019s no wonder he is friends with Ramiris and Beretta. Is he an evangelist of Machinery Arts? Is that why he is called master?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had gotten it completely wrong and were now celebrating Veldora\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>In just one day, they had all come to think of Veldora very favorably. His uninhibited, cheerful attitude must have been looked at warmly.</p><br/><p>While he was not nearly as good as Beretta, he had probably taught Ramiris and Beretta the Machinery Arts.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what the adults thought.</p><br/><p>That would explain why Veldora seemed to think so highly of himself.</p><br/><p>And since Ramiris called him \u2018master,\u2019 this assumption seemed to make the most sense.</p><br/><p>(What!? After everything I have done, I did not expect this reaction. I don\u2019t know, I thought they would pamper me and praise me to the heavens\u2026)</p><br/><p>Veldora was perplexed.</p><br/><p>But Michelle no longer looked like she wanted to fight, so there was no platform for him to show off.</p><br/><p>It was just as Veldora had given up. He looked around and saw that the expressions of dazzled amazement.</p><br/><p>It was the children.</p><br/><p>There was respect and awe there as they looked up at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo coool!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to get cyborg surgery so you can teach me Machinery Arts too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou went out in order to save us, didn\u2019t you? That was so cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Words of passionate gratitude now rained over Veldora.</p><br/><p>(This! This is the praise that I have been waiting for!!)</p><br/><p>Veldora was moved.</p><br/><p>It was unfortunate that the adults had not understood how amazing he was, but he no longer cared about it.</p><br/><p>As long as he was popular, it did not matter if they were children.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaa-ahahahahaha! You all have very keen eyes. Very different from these adults who know nothing! Good! I am feeling very generous, and wish to splurge! Now! Let the grand pancake party recommence!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s excitement had reached a new high, and he prepared his grill once again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

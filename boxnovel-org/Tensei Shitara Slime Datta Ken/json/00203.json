So he snapped his fingers, he was able to turn the sound into a shock wave and send it out.</p><br/><p>He possesses a fiendish ability which doesn\u2019t match his appearance.</p><br/><p>The one who faced Tear were the two female knight leaders.</p><br/><p>The Yellow Knight Kizna and the White Knight Meutel.</p><br/><p>The two of them are very compatible.</p><br/><p>Against Kizna with her prided iron wall defense and Meutel who has a godsend healing ability.</p><br/><p>There could only be a few people who possess the offensive capability that is able to surpass their combination.</p><br/><p>On top of that, since they obtained the power of the demon duke class, the two could brag and didn\u2019t think that they could be defeated.</p><br/><p>Facing them, Tear laughed eerily.</p><br/><p>She brandished the large sickle she held in her hand while laughing.</p><br/><p>Tear the Teardrop. That\u2019s the name of the grim reaper who reaps life.</p><br/><p>Her favorite food are tears of entreaty.</p><br/><p>She loves more than anything to see the tears of someone who is asking for mercy[2].</p><br/><p>Tear possesses the Unique Skill\u300eThe Ignorant (Optimist)[3]\u300f.</p><br/><p>Her ideal is just doing what she is told to do without thinking about anything else.</p><br/><p>Just like her personality, her ability has a condition to activate, that is, all of her abilities will increase only when she receives an order.</p><br/><p>But for her, that\u2019s not a problem.</p><br/><p>Because Tear is strong, even without relying on her ability, as she had an unyielding mind which never worried and a strong body from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>Above all else, it is because there were always reliable comrades who gave her orders.</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t worry about anything.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she gives death to her enemy even more brutally.</p><br/><p>And, fighting against the last person, Laplace, is the Red Knight Fran and the Black Knight Claude.</p><br/><p>The Red Knight Fran is strong.</p><br/><p>Because she has experienced death once already, her energy rose greatly.</p><br/><p>And, it bloomed by fusing with a demon.</p><br/><p>The ability she obtained is called Unique Skill\u300eUnshaken One[4]\u300f.</p><br/><p>Her mind will not be affected by anything other than the feeling of excitement.</p><br/><p>A rather mysterious ability that increases her strength if she feels unrest in her mind.</p><br/><p>The ability that can even turn emotions like anger and fear into power.</p><br/><p>And now, Fran felt fury towards Laplace, who was carrying the Blue Knight Oxishan, who is her brother, on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>She changed her intense emotions into gushing power as she glared at Laplace.</p><br/><p>As the way it was at that moment, her sword wouldn\u2019t be able to graze Laplace. She understood that, thus she turned her emotions into energy in order to keep a calm mind.</p><br/><p>Since Laplace said that he was reading her actions from the waves of her emotions, then she just needed to make everything unperceivable.</p><br/><p>While facing against Laplace, Fran pushed her ability to a higher level.</p><br/><p>The Black Knight Claude is the strongest knight among Leon\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>However, he holds no arrogance in his heart.</p><br/><p>He experienced what the strongest person is like, when he was with Yuuki.</p><br/><p>The \u201cHero\u201d Chloe O\u2019Bell\u2015\u2015She is special.</p><br/><p>As well as the high-ranking people of the Mixed corps.</p><br/><p>A lot of Otherworlders were a part of the corps and it could be said that they all own troublesome special abilities.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t fight foolishly with just a sword, as they also learned the techniques to fight using all of their available abilities.</p><br/><p>Fair and square, that is to say, a phrase that is only true when the opponent also stands in the same arena. However, in real combat, justice is only for the one who survives.</p><br/><p>Understanding that, Claude even studied the way to fight people who are stronger than himself, and thus Claude changed.</p><br/><p>He became greedier and wanted for more strength.</p><br/><p>Fusing with the demon was merely an opportunity. In order to gain the power he desires.</p><br/><p>And the ability that he acquired was Unique Skill\u300eChallenger(Battler)\u300f.</p><br/><p>The exact power that Claude was hoping for, an ability which specializes in fighting.</p><br/><p>Claude didn\u2019t neglect his training and made the ability blossom. Time was irrelevant, as the power had answered his wish.</p><br/><p>And at this time, Claude was able to meet an enemy who he could test his ability on.</p><br/><p>Claude challenged Laplace whilst making a ferocious smile.</p><br/><p>And then there is Laplace.</p><br/><p>He is the strongest member of the Moderate Clown Troupe.</p><br/><p>He possesses fearsome power that could even be called at the level of an extraordinary Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>The power to foresee, he can see the future several seconds ahead of time due to his Unique Skill\u300eSeer (Future Vision)[5]\u300f.</p><br/><p>And, with his Unique Skill\u300eDeceiver[6]\u300f, he can unleash phantasmagoric attacks.</p><br/><p>It is as if he brings something into existence from nothing, a knife flies out from an empty space, whilst actually being a bomb that he disguised as a knife, and it ends before the enemy can understand anything.</p><br/><p>High physical strength and combat senses.</p><br/><p>And with his highly versatile offensive ability and perfect future foresight, he can be considered invincible.</p><br/><p>He introduced himself as the vice captain of the Moderate Clown Troupe, but if compared in fighting strength, Laplace surpasses Kazaream, who\u2019s the captain.</p><br/><p>It can be said that his combat ability is beyond the former Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>However, since he disliked the idea of being in a troublesome position, he didn\u2019t want to stand at the top.</p><br/><p>Happily hanging out with his fellow clowns was what made him happy.</p><br/><p>Kazaream, who had been his captain, severed the ties between the two of them after he rose to be one of the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>The reason was simple, because Laplace would overdo things.</p><br/><p>Since a temporary agreement had been made, quarrels between Demon Lords were forbidden.</p><br/><p>If Kazaream needed to ask Laplace to help him, the situation could easily go downhill.</p><br/><p>In this way, Laplace was aware that he was not helpful.</p><br/><p>In addition, it\u2019s in his nature that he will become unstoppable by seeing more blood.</p><br/><p>His nature is the reason why he doesn\u2019t have any intention to stand at the top.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Laplace was kept as the final trump card.</p><br/><p>And he was able to carry out his goal. He had done it.</p><br/><p>Bring chaos to the world!</p><br/><p>It was his dream to raise up an uproar of agonized cries and transform the world to become more chaotic.</p><br/><p>He is a genuine lunatic, he might become interested in Yuuki if he had the chance to talk with him.</p><br/><p>He had gained that goal because of a sorrowful event.</p><br/><p>Clayman, whom he had had a close relationship with, was murdered by Demon Lord Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Laplace who hadn\u2019t had a goal, obtained the goal of his dead best friend.</p><br/><p>He acts in order to scatter fear and chaos so to make the world a crazier place.</p><br/><p>Kagali didn\u2019t have any regrets about involving her subordinates of the Moderate Clown Troupe.</p><br/><p>She decided that she needed their power since this battle was the final and decisive one.</p><br/><p>If she had sent Laplace at the time when she was still Demon Lord Kazaream, the result may have been different.</p><br/><p>If she had requested Laplace\u2019s help, whose madness and ability were both authentic, she thought that she may have walked a different path by this time.</p><br/><p>Clayman could still be alive as her right hand man, so Kagali thought.</p><br/><p>However, all of those are no more than afterthoughts.</p><br/><p>At that time, she was a conceited person and had completely underestimated Leon.</p><br/><p>Even if she regrets it now, she should reflect and keep living, however\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The word \u2018reflect\u2019 does not exist in Kagali\u2019s dictionary.</p><br/><p>Because Kagali didn\u2019t have any strong fellowship with the others, like Laplace, she didn\u2019t feel anything when the weak were eliminated.</p><br/><p>She only had a small thought that perhaps there was a path like that too.</p><br/><p>Since she involved her former colleagues in this war, she couldn\u2019t do things half-heartedly.</p><br/><p>Even though her power increased greatly, she was anxious as she had few pawns.</p><br/><p>Thus, she called her most trusted people and gave them power.</p><br/><p>She introduced them to Velda and had each of them were given a large quantity of souls.</p><br/><p>In the process they obtained Demon Lord Seeds and awakened.</p><br/><p>Did Velda use some kind of technique? Since it gave them only the power they wished for, like magic.</p><br/><p>Currently, each of them had been strengthened to that of awakened Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>Leon\u2019s subordinates, the knights, seemed to have had their power increased greatly, but of course they were still no match for Kagali and Co.</p><br/><p> It was funny when she thought about it, as the knights who showed their best resistance were pitiful in her sight.</p><br/><p>At the same time, joy filled the innermost depths of her heart, she unconsciously broke into a smile.</p><br/><p>(Foolish people. They won\u2019t be able to defeat us anyway.)</p><br/><p>Thinking so, Kagali advanced towards Leon whilst basked in a feeling of absolute superiority.</p><br/><p>Intense battles commenced, and the situation declined quickly.</p><br/><p>The Moderate Clown Troupe were too strong.</p><br/><p>If the knights hadn\u2019t fused with the demons, they would have been defeated almost instantly.</p><br/><p>Leon\u2019s subordinates, the knights, were not able to compete at all against the overwhelming strength of the Moderate Clown Troupe members who were of the awakened Demon Lord class.</p><br/><p>Rather Leon might praise them for the fact that they had not been defeated at this point.</p><br/><p>The group Kagali brought was terrifying.</p><br/><p>(The situation will only get worse if this continues.)</p><br/><p>Leon analyzed the bad situation and ground his teeth.</p><br/><p>And, more importantly\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cUfufufufu. Leon, you will end here. Your subordinates don\u2019t seem reliable either.</p><br/><p>And yet, you haven\u2019t become serious, even in this situation.</p><br/><p>I have realized your weakness.</p><br/><p>You are too soft.</p><br/><p>When I watched your fight against Yuuki-sama, I thought of this.</p><br/><p>\u2018This guy, he\u2019s really a softie who can\u2019t get serious since he is always protecting his subordinates\u2019.</p><br/><p>You make me laugh.</p><br/><p>Unlike us, who don\u2019t feel anything even if we sacrifice 200.000 angels, you intend to protect 1 million citizens.</p><br/><p>Did you seriously think that you could win if the two of us fight?</p><br/><p>No way, you didn\u2019t think something immature like \u2019The desire to protect something will become power!\u2019 right?</p><br/><p>I investigated about how you created this city by gathering the oppressed people and orphans that you picked up.</p><br/><p>Also, I analyzed your behavior so far.</p><br/><p>Although you stand out with your villain-like speech and behavior, aren\u2019t you actually a nice guy?</p><br/><p>Yes, I understand.</p><br/><p>I know that you want to deny it too.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how you deny it, the fact that you cannot fight all out won\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>After all, your power is too strong, you would destroy this country if you fight seriously!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015That\u2019s right, Kagali\u2019s words were true.</p><br/><p>Leon\u2019s ability, Ultimate Skill\u300ePurity Lord Metatron\u300fis a wide ranged type ability suitable for large-scale annihilation.</p><br/><p>If he went all out, this magical city state would be destroyed from the inside.</p><br/><p>And Kagali who anticipated that the angels would be blockaded on the outside of the barrier, infiltrated with just her group.</p><br/><p>Against Leon, who can\u2019t go all out, she prepared more than enough forces.</p><br/><p>And now, the situation splendidly became just as how Kagali wished for it to be.</p><br/><p>Kagali who was happy, attacked Leon whilst laughing.</p><br/><p>Attacking as if to torment him, Kagali was having fun cutting off Leon\u2019s path of retreat.</p><br/><p>In order to clear her long time grudge, Kagali, who had reached the moment of her revenge, felt the greatest delight.</p><br/><p>Kagali who fused both the powers of an awakened Demon Lord and the power of a seraphim class angel, became a genuine monster.</p><br/><p>Even so, it didn\u2019t affect her desire to see Leon cornered and play with him to the end.</p><br/><p>And thus, she succeeded.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, how are you feeling now? I wonder what you feel at this point now that you\u2019ve been cornered by the person whom you looked down upon.\u300d</p><br/><p>The God class one-handed sword that Kagali held cut into Leon\u2019s Gold Circle.</p><br/><p>Although he was barely able to deal with all of her attacks, Leon was gradually being overwhelmed by the difference in strength.</p><br/><p>Although he thrust out his Flame Pillar, Kagali warded off the attack perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u300cShut your trap. There\u2019s no need for me to get serious against someone like you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon answered without getting agitated.</p><br/><p>The odds were against him. Which was exactly why it was not the time to panic.</p><br/><p>Leon is someone who had awakened as a Hero. He was certain that with just his basic fighting power he was capable of defeating Kagali without relying on his ability.</p><br/><p>However, that was a story from long ago.</p><br/><p>At this point Kagali had become a spiritual life-form. Which means, although her appearance was an elf, her essence was something completely different.</p><br/><p>Kagali\u2015\u2015Demon Lord Kazaream\u2015\u2015 was originally a long range support type devil who excelled at rear support.</p><br/><p>Manipulating his pawns, he would skillfully achieve his goal.</p><br/><p>Hence, she knew well that she wasn\u2019t strong enough to fight at the front herself.</p><br/><p>Besides, if it was with her original Demon Lord body, she could fight at an ordinary devil\u2019s level, but her physical elf body wasn\u2019t suitable for fighting, she realized that when she was defeated by Damrada.</p><br/><p>That was why, she reconstructed her body.</p><br/><p>She completely dominated her body with Ultimate Skill\u300eDominion Lord Melchizedek\u300f.</p><br/><p>The current Kagali has the physical ability to be able to fight against Leon equally, and supporting her is\u300eDominion Lord Melchizedek\u300fwhich provides her with high battle senses.</p><br/><p>Thus, Leon\u2019s attack didn\u2019t reach Kagali, instead Kagali grew each time they clashed as she absorbed Leon\u2019s fighting style.</p><br/><p>For Leon, he was in a very bad situation.</p><br/><p>Though Leon was speaking as if he still had composure to spare, but he immediately realized that the situation was indeed abnormal.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, just like what Kagali had said, the situation did not permit him to go all out.</p><br/><p>Impatience rose in Leon since he had underestimated his opponent too much.</p><br/><p>At that moment, one of Kagali\u2019s sword strikes finally grazed Leon\u2019s flank lightly. Leon received a small cut due to the tip of Kagali\u2019s sword entering a gap of his armor.</p><br/><p>Kagali who saw that, smiled complacently as she laughed evilly.</p><br/><p>\u300cUfufufu. Oh my, my my.</p><br/><p>Leon, even for someone like you, are you finally unable to handle my sword?</p><br/><p>My movement will become even faster you know? I wonder if you will be alright with that?</p><br/><p>If you cry and apologize to me whilst prostrating on the ground and swear your allegiance to me, I will spare your life, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFu. Shut up, I don\u2019t need to lower my head to the likes of you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh dear, I thought that you would say that.</p><br/><p>Well then\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>So, she stopped talking for a moment, and deepened her evil smile.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll make your beautiful face soggy with tears and covered with remorse!!</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll strip you bare, cut off your limbs, turning you into a Daruma doll, and then I\u2019ll attach a collar on your neck and parade you around in front of the citizens whom you protected!!</p><br/><p>Gyaaahahahahahahaha!!</p><br/><p>It will be fun to see the despair on their faces once they see your miserable and unsightly self.</p><br/><p>Even if they cry and beg for mercy, I won\u2019t spare them.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll slaughter them one by one in front of you, and at the end, turn them into dog food!\u300d</p><br/><p>She declared those words and laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>\u300cHohohohoho. Wonderful!! As expected from captain!!\u300d(Footman)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, so fun. I also like it!\u300d(Tear)</p><br/><p>\u300cIndeed, I didn\u2019t have that idea. I didn\u2019t even think of that, what a brutal act!\u300d(Laplace)</p><br/><p>Hearing Kagali\u2019s remark, all members of the Moderate Clown Troupe praised her highly in excitement.</p><br/><p>Even Leon frowned when he imagined it.</p><br/><p>He thought that even a low-life had a limit.</p><br/><p>Kagali smiled and grinned,</p><br/><p>\u300cUfufufufu. It\u2019s okay, Leon.</p><br/><p>Even if you destroy this country because you hate the idea of exposing your unsightly figure.</p><br/><p>If you get serious, I too, am willing to be fair and square and fight with you seriously, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>She provoked Leon with a sneer which was like saying \u201cyou won\u2019t be able do it\u201d.</p><br/><p>Even if Leon chose to do it, it was not a problem for Kagali either.</p><br/><p>At that time, she would beat Leon from the front and show off her strength.</p><br/><p>Now, Kagali didn\u2019t sense any threat from Leon since she felt she had become strong.</p><br/><p>If she could break Leon\u2019s high pride, she didn\u2019t care what sort of means she needed to take.</p><br/><p>Leon saw that it wasn\u2019t a bluff from Kagali\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, Kagali could actually be equal to him or perhaps even stronger than him.</p><br/><p>In any case, it would be difficult to put an end to this without casualties from the citizens with the way the things were going now.</p><br/><p>\u300cLeon-sama, please don\u2019t mind us!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAgainst fiends like them, you mustn\u2019t let them escape!\u300d</p><br/><p>Alrose and Claude advised Leon together.</p><br/><p>They were in their own desperate situations, however they didn\u2019t remain silent when Leon was made a fool of.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. If he was defeated, the people in his country wouldn\u2019t remain safe after all.</p><br/><p>(Forgive me, I will certainly kill this fiend!)</p><br/><p>Leon steeled himself.</p><br/><p>Either way, as long as he didn\u2019t defeat these fiends, his citizens\u2019 safety couldn\u2019t be guaranteed.</p><br/><p>Then he would do the only thing he could.</p><br/><p>Thinking so, he was going to release his powerful power\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease wait, Leon-sama. You do not need to worry, I have isolated this castle from the city.\u300d</p><br/><p>A clear woman's voice made him regain his senses.</p><br/><p>A Devil Lord named Mizari. Also, the woman who was working together with Leon now.</p><br/><p>With Mizari\u2019s ability, the castle was completely separated from the outside world.</p><br/><p>Observing the situation, Mizari prioritized to take the most optimum action depending on the situation.</p><br/><p>Thanks to her, the situation would change once again.</p><br/><p>Kagali unpleasantly knitted her brows due to Mizari\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh? Aren\u2019t you Guy\u2019s follower?</p><br/><p>You were able to act on your own will, heh.</p><br/><p>I certainly thought that you could only move by Guy\u2019s order.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s been a long time, Kazaream-sama.</p><br/><p>I certainly thought that you had died on some plain, but that stubbornness of yours is the same as before.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFu, fufufufufu. Nice speach, for a small fry who only hides in Guy\u2019s shadow!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou want to try me? Well anyway, it\u2019s this side\u2019s victory to buy some time.</p><br/><p>Because I had asked Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s aid, the reinforcements will come soon.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s aid you say? Ku, kukuku, ufu, uhahahahahahahaaaaaa!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kagali burst into laughter due to Mizari\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>It became a very loud laughter as Kagali\u2019s subordinates also joined in.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is so funny?\u300d</p><br/><p>Mizari asked her as she felt that it was strange.</p><br/><p>\u300cUfufufufu. Demon Lord Rimuru has died you fool!!</p><br/><p>That annoying Demon Lord is already gone. About this time, Rimuru\u2019s subordinates must be in the midst of pandemonium!</p><br/><p>Whether due to an unsightly internal discord? Or are they splitting and naming themselves as the new Demon Lord?</p><br/><p>Either way, this matter won\u2019t be settled quickly.</p><br/><p>Of course, they won\u2019t be able to be reinforcements. Do you understand?\u300d</p><br/><p>As one might expect, Leon and Mizari changed their expressions since Kagali said it triumphantly.</p><br/><p>It was too unexpected.</p><br/><p>For that absurd Demon Lord Rimuru to be the one who lost first, that wasn\u2019t a story that they could believe so easily.</p><br/><p>But, They didn\u2019t feel Kagali was telling a lie going from her looks.</p><br/><p>\u300cImpossible!? That stubborn Demon Lord wouldn\u2019t die so easily!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama who was recognized by Guy-sama, that is impossible\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Kagali who was filled with a sense of superiority due to the two\u2019s reactions, answered them.</p><br/><p>\u300cUfufufufu.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it may be good to taste your despair.</p><br/><p>This Great War, our victory is already set in stone.</p><br/><p>If you want to know why\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>It\u2019s because Demon Lord Milim is the one who destroyed Demon Lord Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Do you understand what this means?</p><br/><p>The strongest beings, that is Demon Lord Guy Crimson and Demon Lord Milim Nava.</p><br/><p>As well as that annoying Demon Lord Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Among those three. Demon Lord Milim Nava is under Velda-sama\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>And, Demon Lord Rimuru is dead.</p><br/><p>The remaining one that we need to be cautious of is Demon Lord Guy Crimson alone.</p><br/><p>And even that Guy will face the strongest hero.

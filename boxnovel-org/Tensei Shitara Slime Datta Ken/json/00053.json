Just kidding, next chapter made the name sound strange\u2026</p><br/><p>Life in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>053. Freedom Association</p><br/><p>We proceeded into Brumund\u2019s Royal Capital.</p><br/><p>The city appears old but sturdy.</p><br/><p>The pedestrians appeared bright and cheerful with no gloominess in sight.</p><br/><p>Probably due to the fact that there is no visible damage from powerful monsters or other threats.</p><br/><p>And as you\u2019d expect from such a remote country, there were many people geared up.</p><br/><p>Based on my appraisal ability, most armors and weapons used are of inferior quality. Similarly, they also seemed rather weak.</p><br/><p>However, smelling the air of a downtown area after so long was pretty exciting.</p><br/><p>Buying some roasted meat on a stick, we continued onward.</p><br/><p>I have no idea what meat this is, but it\u2019s strangely delicious.</p><br/><p>Actually, I can analyze the meat to find out where it came from, but I won\u2019t do that. I have something else that needs to be analyzed.</p><br/><p>The sauce. This sauce could come in handy for research. Though it is unfair to the chef, eating something lets me learn its recipe.</p><br/><p>So I made a mental note of the required ingredients for this meal.</p><br/><p>I am advancing further in, guided by the trio, with a specific store in mind.</p><br/><p>Magic Tool Store.</p><br/><p>Normal tool stores and magic tool stores are very different than what people from my world would imagine.</p><br/><p>When adventurers, for example, refer to \u201ctool stores\u201d they typically mean magic ones.</p><br/><p>And it is one of these magic tool stores \u2013 I\u2019ll simply call it tool store from now on \u2013 that was our destination.</p><br/><p>To learn current market prices.</p><br/><p>I am planning to sell medium grade medicine today. However, even if I want to sell it at 15 silvers a piece, I need to first know the price of low grade medicine.</p><br/><p>I also want to know if there is any product made from Illusion Flowers, or something related to them.</p><br/><p>If we turn them in to the guild, we can make ten silvers per bouquet.</p><br/><p>Though you\u2019d think you could make a lot of money this way, but going into the forest to search for this elusive flower often proves pointless, so most people abstain.</p><br/><p>So if you\u2019re planning on becoming a permanent harvesting adventurer, you shouldn\u2019t expect to become rich quick.</p><br/><p>Thus, usually people find them while adventuring somewhere and come to sell them; the buyer then collects them and turns them over to whoever requests.</p><br/><p>Which would mean that harvesting requests tend to stick around for years. It\u2019s a lengthy process.</p><br/><p>And since I have lots of such medical plants and flowers, I\u2019d want to know their current prices.</p><br/><p>So, we entered the store.</p><br/><p>A peculiar smell filled the room and the store itself gave off a queer aura.</p><br/><p>A store you\u2019d expect to be run by some elderly witch.</p><br/><p>Actually, the owner looks just like that.</p><br/><p>I looked around, quickly evaluating the goods. Sadly, I didn\u2019t see any rare items.</p><br/><p>Low grade potions are in stock, and at a higher price.</p><br/><p>Why? Simple: the neighboring Farmas Kingdom has stopped allowing goods to come from the Dwarf Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Though I guess I over exaggerated; they are merely preventing any goods that could be used by the military to reach here.</p><br/><p>And since high quality potions no longer arrive from the Dwarf Kingdom, they have no choice but to sell the inferior stuff made by the local pharmacists.</p><br/><p>Besides, since they are making things by boiling medical herbs found in forests and caves, the medicine they produce is naturally inferior.</p><br/><p>Hmm? Do I smell an opportunity\u2026?</p><br/><p>At the moment, low grade potion [Quality: Normal, Effect: 20%] is sold for 2 silver coin.</p><br/><p>In comparison, abysmal potion [Quality: Low, Effect 15%] is sold for 1 silver coin.</p><br/><p>So even a small change in effect can lead to such a drastic change in price. I guess considering that it could save your life, people are rarely stingy with medicine.</p><br/><p>And with such shortage of material, adventurers who come across medical herbs will quickly find a buyer even if their guild doesn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s always in demand, it seems.</p><br/><p>Next, Illusion Flowers.</p><br/><p>From this flower you can make Hallucinogens and Bewitching Perfume.</p><br/><p>The effects of these items are,</p><br/><p>Hallucinogens: Used to amplify\u3008Hypnotism-type Magic\u3009. Taking it normally will induce hallucinations. Leads to addiction.</p><br/><p>Bewitching Perfume: Amplifies the effects of\u3008Hypnotism-type Magic\u3009by up to 30%. Increases resistance to\u3008Hypnotism-type Magic\u3009by up to 30%.</p><br/><p>That would be for quality item, of course; normal one would increase the effects by only 20%.</p><br/><p>What is amplified? The success rate of the skill, the extent of control, and the duration. It is an item coveted by most practitioners of this type of magic.</p><br/><p>However, addiction is bad. It\u2019s probably similar to our world\u2019s hallucinogens. Though I doubt they sell it to just anybody.</p><br/><p>By the way, while I was analyzing the poison, I happened to have acquired some resistance to it. At this rate, I might get a new skill soon.</p><br/><p>If I harvest and analyze some more poisonous plants, of course. Eating the plant would be a bad idea, but I wouldn\u2019t get poisoned if I absorbed it into my stomach.</p><br/><p>So, I can\u2019t die from poison. And since I wouldn\u2019t get food poisoning either, I taste tested most dishes during the trip.</p><br/><p>But I digress.</p><br/><p>The effects of these items is easy to dispel, but surely they cost a lot?</p><br/><p>\u300cHaah? Hallucinogens and Bewitching Perfume? You can\u2019t get such amazing items here.</p><br/><p>Rather than in a small country like ours, you should be looking elsewhere!\u300d</p><br/><p>The store\u2019s granny told me.</p><br/><p>Did she think that I was ridiculing her?</p><br/><p>Chances are the fact that she has even heard of such medicines is impressive.</p><br/><p>In fact, the medicine sold here is made by her. She\u2019s pretty learned, it seems.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, my bad. The thing is, I happen to have gotten my hands on some of those, but aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s actually the real deal.</p><br/><p>I even borrowed a gold coin to buy it, so I\u2019m curious!\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, trying to deceive her.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say? Show me. I\u2019ll check if for you.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t charge you, so rest easy!\u300d</p><br/><p>The granny replied.</p><br/><p>Since she asked, I had no choice but to take out a small bag with a hallucinogen I made prior.</p><br/><p>I have quite a few more bags like this. The hallucinogen is fine like sugar, but red in color.</p><br/><p>The granny took it from my hands and used\u3008Identification Magic\u3009on it.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh my! It\u2019s real! Aren\u2019t you lucky.</p><br/><p>With this much, you can easily make 2 golds coins.</p><br/><p>But production and sales of this item is forbidden to amateurs.</p><br/><p>It can only be sold by magicians with a special license, so beware!</p><br/><p>If you want to pawn it, however, I\u2019d be happy to buy it from you for two gold coins!\u300d</p><br/><p>She said, surprised.</p><br/><p>Turning a bouquet in to the guild would earn you 10 silvers. Whereas processing it would yield you 2 gold coins. That\u2019s 20 times higher.</p><br/><p>Moreover, you can also make some Bewitching Perfume from it. All you need is to dilute the extract with water.</p><br/><p>So this is another product that will sell well; I\u2019m glad we picked it.</p><br/><p>I mean, I knew magic items were expensive, but for them to be so expensive! Well, it\u2019s my profit, so I don\u2019t complain.</p><br/><p>But now that she had evaluated it for me, I can\u2019t just leave without buying anything.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t she have any good items\u2026?</p><br/><p>Seeing a complete lack of rare items, I started searching for anything I might need.</p><br/><p>And then I found it, \u300eDummy\u2019s Guide! Easy to understand \u3008Elemental Magic\u3009theories!\u300f\u2013 a magic book titled thus.</p><br/><p>Seems like its a part of a popular publication, but to think that it is even sold out here?</p><br/><p>Well, I can read some, and even simply reading letters is practice. So let\u2019s buy the book.</p><br/><p>\u300cAha. So, little girl, you\u2019re aspiring to be a magician?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a beginner\u2019s book.</p><br/><p>Kids who want to enroll in an academy study from this book.</p><br/><p>But you know, you can\u2019t become a magician just from reading this book, are you sure you want to buy it?\u300d</p><br/><p>A magic academy! How wonderful. I want to go check it out someday.</p><br/><p>Someday, I\u2019ll use\u300eGreat Sage\u300fto get all the magic in the world\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, no problem. How much is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cChild, your face is pretty but you\u2019ve got the tongue of a middle-aged man\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah, well. Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t cheap. Magic is a rich-man\u2019s hobby.</p><br/><p>The masses, without connections or something, can never learn magic.</p><br/><p>Just this book costs a single gold coin; too much, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>I wonder\u2026 since I\u2019m wearing the mask, is the granny guessing by my voice?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t really care, either way. Maybe I should change my voice to seem older\u2026?</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s too late now. And since it\u2019s a pain, I\u2019ll leave it as is for now.</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019m around 150 cm tall right now, should I claim to be a young boy?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a year since I was born, but my soul is at least 38 years old; in other words, it\u2019s hard to figure out my age. In any case, I\u2019m a child at heart.</p><br/><p>So if I look young, that isn\u2019t a problem.</p><br/><p>An enigmatic boy wearing a mask. Don\u2019t fret, there\u2019s plenty of delusional idiots calling themselves heroes and demon lords, so I\u2019d fit right in.</p><br/><p>So let\u2019s introduce myself thus from now on.</p><br/><p>Magic is for the rich, huh. There\u2019s probably plenty among them that are incapable of learning magic, too.</p><br/><p>A single gold coin is about a hundred thousand yen.</p><br/><p>Though they do seem to have a printing press, I wonder why there\u2019s so few printed books?</p><br/><p>\u300cNo problem. I\u2019ll buy the book for 1 gold. However, I wonder why it\u2019s so expensive?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s simple. Magic books, you see, can only be written down by hand.</p><br/><p>Though the Ghost Researchers have the copying machine, it rejects magic manuscripts.</p><br/><p>So, any magic book on the market has been written by hand.</p><br/><p>By the way, this book I wrote myself when I was younger, so please take care of it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. I didn\u2019t know, so thank you. I\u2019ll treat it with care.\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, handing over a single gold coin. Transaction complete.</p><br/><p>\u300cDoesn\u2019t look it, but she\u2019s rich, huh\u2026 but still a child, right?</p><br/><p>What are parents doing handing their kids this much money\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She grumbled to herself, while handing over the book.</p><br/><p>Magic books are handwritten, so I should expect them to be expensive.</p><br/><p>From now on, whether I stop by the magic academy or another royal capital, I will buy every magic book in sight! So I decided.</p><br/><p>The trio have also purchased whatever they came for. Well, so I say, but they only came to restock on potions and other herbs, so they\u2019ve been waiting for me.</p><br/><p>After thanking the owner, I left the store. It was a time well spent.</p><br/><p>After leaving the store, I stop the trio.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys\u2026 you understand, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>The trio each handed me 10 Illusion Flower bouquets.</p><br/><p>And to each I handed a gold coin. Thus I have 16 gold coins left; so lots more to spend.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d much rather process the Illusion Flowers myself. It would be wasteful to hand them over to the guild.</p><br/><p>During my conversation with the trio, they looked as if they wanted to ask something.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a minute! Rimuru-san, when had you processed the Illusion Flowers?</p><br/><p>Actually, it\u2019s considered really difficult to do!</p><br/><p>There have been people who died from the poisonous gasses that the plants let out!\u300d</p><br/><p>I see. So it really was such a dangerous plant. I guess the price is fitting.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu. Processing such a weed is simple for someone like I!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo fair! I can\u2019t even do it\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected of danna. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at anything now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMe too. Danna is someone who can do anything.\u300d</p><br/><p>Three jealous idiots.</p><br/><p>But other then Ellen, the other two have already accepted the facts.</p><br/><p>And, considering that we have researched the cost as desired, we headed for the Freedom Association.</p><br/><p>We reached Brumund\u2019s Freedom Association Branch.</p><br/><p>The guild was at the end of road leading out of the commercial district where the magic store was.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a stately building made of stone.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf Kingdom often dug down into the stone, so most buildings were at most 3 floors tall.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen would make use of windows designated with magic to light their houses, but this is different. It depends on natural light.</p><br/><p>So I was under the impression that people didn\u2019t build high-rise houses in this world. Well, whether you can consider 5 stories \u201chigh-rise\u201d is a different story.</p><br/><p>When we entered, I noticed that they are somehow regulating the temperature; it was pleasant inside.</p><br/><p>While I actually can\u2019t feel the change in temperature due to my resistances, I could tell the difference using heat detection ability.</p><br/><p>I guess they are keeping the temperature constant with magic. Surprisingly advanced, I must say.</p><br/><p>I had thought that the world travelers kept the world relatively primitive, but I guess they\u2019ve been trying to develop it in a direction different than ours.</p><br/><p>Maybe if there were no monsters or demon lords, this world would be a true magic society.</p><br/><p>However, it can also be said that all the current knowledge has been researched to counter monsters.</p><br/><p>Since the demon lords exercised restraint, the humans bought them off by handing over fertile land; so when power shifts in favor of humans, an invasion into their realms is a legitimate possibility.</p><br/><p>That thought has been preached by the Western Saints Church, I heard.</p><br/><p>True, monsters are stronger right now; but no one knows what the future will hold. I guess I need to implement some real foreign policy to protect the rights of my city.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m glad I came here.</p><br/><p>By seeing a human city, by learning something about humans, I can better prepare against possible future threats.</p><br/><p>Thus, I decided to see more and more things.</p><br/><p>Now then, I shouldn\u2019t stand in the doorway.</p><br/><p>I was guided further in by the trio. The inside reminded me of a municipal building\u2019s reception room.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a desk like one you\u2019d see at an airport\u2013where you surrender your baggage, with a plate that reads: Sales Counter.</p><br/><p>All in all, there are three counters separated from each other.</p><br/><p>The Sales Counter I just mentioned.</p><br/><p>Counter for visitors and other general users.</p><br/><p>Counter specific for adventurers.</p><br/><p>The room is separated into these three sectors.</p><br/><p>The sales counter is exactly what it sounds like; items that you found or went to obtain on request are brought over here.</p><br/><p>The general counter is used by beginners and Freedom Association members who live in the city. That\u2019s where you go to register or retire from the guild.</p><br/><p>The adventurer\u2019s counter can only be used by authorized adventurers.</p><br/><p>An adventurer is a Freedom Association member who either goes foraging, subjugating, or hunting on request. Some take on different types of tasks, but most people still refer to them by the generic term\u2013adventurer.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, an adventurer is someone who has to have some basic combat ability.</p><br/><p>For example, there\u2019s a specialized division called the Magicians Guild. To be affiliated with them, you need to be able to use some kind of magic; however, affiliation with them does not guarantee usefulness to the Freedom Association.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no good if all you can do is use some magic. Only after you have lived by foraging, subjugating, or hunting are you recognized as an adventurer.</p><br/><p>So, what are the merits to becoming an adventurer?</p><br/><p>While every Freedom Association Branch is affiliated with a specific country, its members are able to change countries easily.</p><br/><p>Leaving the city or even crossing the border is far easier for an adventurer. Of course, this may not apply during wartime, but this allows for greater mobility.</p><br/><p>In other words, compared to people with clear allegiances, Guild Members are able to freely select a country where they want to live. Well, not like there\u2019s a big difference other than the tax you\u2019d have to pay.</p><br/><p>The origin of the name \u201cFreedom Association\u201d comes from adventurers who wanted to be able to freely move between countries.</p><br/><p>Well, even so, there\u2019s not that many people who constantly switch countries.</p><br/><p>This was explained to me by the three idiots on our way to the counters.</p><br/><p>After receiving this explanation, we proceeded to the back.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, we\u2019re leading our guest to the backrooms, so let us pass.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Cabal-san. You have returned. Who might this be?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, Guild Master\u2019s guest. Treat him with respect, please.\u300d</p><br/><p>After that exchange, we were let through.</p><br/><p>And in the background,</p><br/><p>\u300cCabal-san is so cool~!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEllen-san is so gorgeous\u2026 Always so beautiful!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFools! To not understand Gido-san\u2019s greatness\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cBut, who is that kid? Why treat her with respect?\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>I heard the people in the background say this, but couldn\u2019t really understand them.</p><br/><p>Why are the three idiots idolized here? Even in the first village we stopped by they were famous.</p><br/><p>We stopped in front of a room in the back. The room was guarded by two soldiers, who opened the door on Cabal\u2019s signal.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the room is a magic circle.</p><br/><p>Similar to the one that Bester drew. One that allows travel both ways.</p><br/><p>I was guided to the magic circle, and used it to teleport.</p><br/><p>It can be used to travel up to the fourth floor; the fifth floor is accessible via a different circle.</p><br/><p>To prevent infiltration from spies and such. How prudent.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, there are no windows passed the fourth floor. Probably to prevent break-in.</p><br/><p>The magic circle to the fifth floor lies directly beyond the guild master\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>We entered the room.</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome, \u201cOne who commands monsters\u201d!</p><br/><p>I am this Branch\u2019s Guild Master Fuze.\u300d</p><br/><p>A short man with a vigilant face extended his greetings.</p><br/><p>I see, he definitely fits the description of a Guild Master.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s plenty strong and seems rather capable. But if anything, it\u2019s the aura about him.</p><br/><p>He seems to be a rather gutsy individual.</p><br/><p>\u300cI am Rimuru Tempest. Ruler of the new Monster Country \u201cTempest\u201d of the Jura Forest. Pleased to make your acquaintance.\u300d</p><br/><p>After finishing our introductions, we started our questioning.</p><br/><p>Since our meeting lasted long into the night, I decided to stay in one of the Freedom Association\u2019s rooms.</p><br/><p>P.S. Sadly, although I had plenty of money left and finally arrived at a human city, I couldn\u2019t venture into a new \u201cfrontier\u201d for now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

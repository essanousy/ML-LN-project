That was why she approached her opponent with caution, slowly accumulating damage, and observing her opponent.</p><br/><p>\u300cHah! What cowardice. All that talk about demons and being above us, utter hogwash; you aren\u2019t a match for us, the strongest Knights.</p><br/><p>We are before his majesty, the Emperor, and I shall defeat you henceforth.</p><br/><p>I shall also wager that your master is far weaker than Kondo-dono. And you can continue to serve her in hell!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. Words are cheap, you can talk after you\u2019ve won.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a fairly patient person, while you look to be a hasty one.</p><br/><p>Well, Carrera-sama is also the type who has a short fuse, and needs someone to watch over her.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMe, hasty? Have you still not felt the difference in our abilities?</p><br/><p>That childish looking demon with the purplish ponytail is indeed strong.</p><br/><p>But, you are simply garbage! Just give up and die already!\u300d</p><br/><p>Showering insults in the midst of clashing blades, was Royal Knight No. 5 Garcia.</p><br/><p>A large build overflowing with chakra. And with the effect of ultimate gift\u300eAlternative\u300f, \u201cConquerer of the Hunt\u201d \u2015\u2015turning the will to hunt into power\u2015\u2015, he hunted down evil existences.</p><br/><p>It had a direct effect on his body, creating a sturdy physique.</p><br/><p>Plus the protection from his Legend grade armor, he needed not worry about recoil from his own power.</p><br/><p>Utilising high level abilities, Garcia, while taunting his opponent, was not being careless.</p><br/><p>Demon nobility were threats on a similar level to a Demon Lord. They were not foes to be taken lightly.</p><br/><p>But, his taunts bore no fruit. As Spirit Forms, the strength of demons were strongly influenced by their emotions.</p><br/><p>He was hoping to create an opening by taunting his opponent, but it didn\u2019t seem to work.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are indeed vulgar in addition to being hasty.</p><br/><p>I do not think all humans are inferior.</p><br/><p>But, then.</p><br/><p>Souls have their own distinction. No matter what they do to hide it, a person who has a vulgar soul is unable to hide the fact.\u300d</p><br/><p>Garcia was falling for the opponent\u2019s taunts instead.</p><br/><p>And for the next few exchanges, Agera did not unsheathe her blade, and, while observing Garcia, avoided attacks with a combination of magic and minimal movements.</p><br/><p>As long as she didn\u2019t take any fatal injuries, Agera would not be defeated.</p><br/><p>There was no sign of her current injuries starting to heal. This was most likely caused by the effect of Garcia\u2019s Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>But Agera was a Spirit Form, there were many ways to recover after the battle.</p><br/><p>Understanding the difference in abilities, she vividly felt her lack of ability to effectively deal with an opponent who wielded an Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>But, she knew that her base capabilities vastly overpowered his.</p><br/><p>That being the case, like her prey, if she could only grasp the essence of and focus her power\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>And then, hearing Emperor Rudra\u2019s outburst, the situation shifted.</p><br/><p>\u300cHis Majesty has declared his intentions. I\u2019m afraid you all, including your master, must die now!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing those words from Garcia, something snapped in Agera\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>(To lower our god, Rimuru-sama\u2026\u2026 To the level of a simple demon!?!</p><br/><p>Even stating that we\u2026\u2026 must die!?)</p><br/><p>Fury.</p><br/><p>Agera drew her blade with a naturally flowing movement.</p><br/><p>Battoujutsu\u2015\u2015Yaezakura\u2015\u2015Hakkasen. (EN: Sword Art \u2015\u2015 Double Cherry \u2015\u2015 Eight Petal Flash)</p><br/><p>\u300cHa? \u2026.eh?\u300d</p><br/><p>Garcia couldn\u2019t see it, nor could he understand.</p><br/><p>What in the world, just happened.</p><br/><p>While purely on defense\u2015\u2015plus, taking damage\u2015\u2015his prey, with him was unable to compute, had counterattacked.</p><br/><p>He died before he had the chance to, so it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>The source of his self-confidence, the \u201cArmor\u201d which had the effects of an Ultimate Skill, was sliced through as though it was paper-thin, there was no way he could have understood.</p><br/><p>And he was cut 8 times in a single moment, and lost his life before he had the chance to think about what just happened.</p><br/><p>Agera resheathed her blade,</p><br/><p>\u300cNo bushi (EN: warrior/samurai) would sit idly listening to her master(Rimuru) get insulted, fool!</p><br/><p>But, then again. My role is more of a retainer for my master(Carrera).</p><br/><p>To think I would be that agitated by the words of such small fry\u2026\u2026I have much to learn\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She mumbled.</p><br/><p>Agera grasped the intricacies of her skill at that point.</p><br/><p>Her Unique Skill\u300ePerciever\u300fobserved the enemy, and lets her understand the effective ways to use her strength.</p><br/><p>Then she recollected.</p><br/><p>Of whence, his single ultimate attack, reached the pinnacle of strength.</p><br/><p>Of whence, his lived as a human being, along with his \u201ckatana (soul)\u201d.</p><br/><p>Up till this point Agera, who had been depending on his magic, now understood why she took on the form of a bushi.</p><br/><p>In the distant past, before he reincarnated to this world as a Demon, he was once a samurai, she recalled. (TN: the actual word for samurai is used here, which is why I used bushi earlier)(EN: the gender pronouns got a bit weird here. Sasuga fuse-sensei!)</p><br/><p>\u300cIt may be possible that I was a son of man (human) once, on some other world.\u300d</p><br/><p>With such fleeting thoughts, she comes back to reality.</p><br/><p>All interest was lost on the garbage that she just killed.</p><br/><p>Agera turns her heels, and headed towards the subject of her loyalty, Carrera.</p><br/><p>Espirit was injured all over, and her face showed her composure was fading away.</p><br/><p>But, after hearing what the Emperor said, it contorted in anger.</p><br/><p>Espirit was usually half-hearted, and mostly a hedonist.</p><br/><p>While she usually only paid heed to Carrera\u2019s will, the fact that Demon Lord Rimuru, who she worshipped as a god, was insulted, simply couldn\u2019t be tolerated.</p><br/><p>\u300cAhh\u30fc What a pain! That\u2019s it, time for you to die!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, keep the nonsense to yourself. Those are not words for someone who has only been pathetically running around!\u300d</p><br/><p>Said Royal Knight No. 4 Gardner, mocking Espirit\u2019s determination.</p><br/><p>Holding the overwhelming advantage, it looked like there was no way he could lose.</p><br/><p>Indeed, that was what it looked like.</p><br/><p>Victory would be surely his if he went for the kill now.</p><br/><p>But, he was fond of rubbing salt into the wounds of the weak. His greatest pleasure was hearing the screams of the \u201cstrong\u201d. (EN: in other words, S.)</p><br/><p>That was why, against a strong being that was a Demon Noble like Esprit, who was also a beautiful female, he was holding back to see if he had the chance to hear what he desired.</p><br/><p>He would kill her the moment Espirit begged for her life.</p><br/><p>That twisted fetish of his, now became his downfall.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis much should be enough. Echo-reflection!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The special ability to replicate damage that she has taken onto her attacker, such was Espirit\u2019s unique skill\u300eRetaliator\u300f.</p><br/><p>The incredible amount of damage that had been caused onto a demon\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A human\u2019s body would never be able to take that much punishment.</p><br/><p>Flesh was sundered and bones were crushed.</p><br/><p>The moment Espirit activated her special ability, Gardner was turned into a pile of meat without the chance to even speak. (EN: Esprit is S++!)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat was close.</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t have this power, I would have been the one who was defeated.</p><br/><p>Never underestimate the opponent! That was the lesson huh\u2026.</p><br/><p>In order to teach us, did he\u2026\u2026 purposefully pit us against opponents who would have the upper hand\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>No way, I not buying it\u2026\u2026 Even if this is Rimuru-sama we are talking about\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Espirit felt a chill down her spine, while she was pondering over the matter.</p><br/><p>Death is forbidden! This order, pretty much meant to attain the strength to \u201csurvive\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300cTo defeat an opponent who is stronger than my current self, I have definitely become stronger\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Demons, being Spirit Forms, their emotions bring change to their strength.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t common, but to confront an opponent who had the upper hand, only to easily throw in the towel and end up in defeat was the usual case.</p><br/><p>To implant the will to never give up, into the hearts of demons\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Her heart began to fill with elation and admiration, but that was suppressed and she began to take action once more.</p><br/><p>To make rid of those who insulted her master.</p><br/><p>(TN:Some suitable tunes)</p><br/><p>Veyron was second in terms of capability, among the 7 pillars of the Demon Nobles.</p><br/><p>But despite that, he was unable to reach the warrior before him, tasting the humiliation, and the ground.</p><br/><p>Royal Knight No. 3 Graneet, was a Hero.</p><br/><p>He was one of the people who had laid the foundations of the Empire, and helped usher forth a millennia of peace.</p><br/><p>Known by the title of \u201cGod of War\u201d Graneet, he had retired from his public position and was now one of Emperor Rudra\u2019s most trusted retainers.</p><br/><p>His unmatched skill in spear techniques was like a form of art; to Veyron who was a demon, it looked as though he was trying to receive meteors flying towards him.</p><br/><p>In addition, he was properly using Alternative, and had full control over his Energy.</p><br/><p>The difference in their capabilities was like heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>The only silver lining, would be that any of the others would have been defeated instantly.</p><br/><p>Veyron took his stance, with the newly created spear via Matter Creation, as the one he was just using shattered in his hands. (EN: I am the bone of my\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u300cHear Daemon, the result will be the same no matter how many times we do this. You will never grasp victory with your mimicry. (EN: Mongrel.)</p><br/><p>Avoiding fatal wounds and clinging onto life so dearly, staying hidden away from the beginning would have worked better.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy, how harsh. But, my role is to be the wall that shields the princess (TN: Ultima).</p><br/><p>If there is no one to keep you in check now, even my lady would have a hard time with you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Veyron was Ultima\u2019s butler.</p><br/><p>Being together for the longest time, he has always been there to take care of her.</p><br/><p>Even now, he was suppressing this dangerous man, preventing him from causing unneeded problems.</p><br/><p>And Veyron believed that his master(Ultima) would emerge victorious, so as long as he survived, they would be victorious.</p><br/><p>However\u2026.</p><br/><p>(As expected, this isn\u2019t fine at all. I would like to a comeback against him, if possible\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>The magic he was depending on wasn\u2019t up to the task, so he lacked the means for a decisive move.</p><br/><p>As he was totally overwhelmed in skill, avoiding fatal injuries was the best he could do.</p><br/><p>Anyone else who didn\u2019t have Veyron\u2019s immense reserves of mana, would have long since been defeated.</p><br/><p>The created spear in his hands, was the fourth already.</p><br/><p>He understood he wasn\u2019t able to fully defend with only magic, so he had been using his last resort.</p><br/><p>Copying his opponent\u2019s spear technique, with his unique skill\u300eTracer\u300f.</p><br/><p>Being simply a copy, it won\u2019t bring him victory. Although he couldn\u2019t win, he was able to avoid fatal damage.</p><br/><p>Sadly, he was unable to counterattack relying only on this ability.</p><br/><p>Now then, what to do\u2026.</p><br/><p>As he was thinking, a thunderous roar sounded; the emperor had stood up and had made his outburst.</p><br/><p>Veyron\u2019s soul was boiling over in anger, but felt intense shame at the same time.</p><br/><p>Despite his anger, he had no means to triumph over his adversary.</p><br/><p>\u300cHis Majesty has given the orders.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s time you stopped running, and prepare to meet your maker!\u300d</p><br/><p>The warrior Graneet, releasing the aura (haki) of his \u201cGod of War\u201d days, proudly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Right after that,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey boss, I just saw something super cool!\u300d</p><br/><p>His associate Zonda teleported over, while saying that.</p><br/><p>\u300cZonda, what about your \u201cjob\u201d?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh that, it\u2019s all good. Moss-sama told me that boss was in a pinch.</p><br/><p>Also, I got to see something real amazing and thought of a great idea!\u300d</p><br/><p>If Veyron was the butler, Zonda was the page (EN: man-servant).</p><br/><p>Although they were both demon nobles, the difference in class was apparent.</p><br/><p>But, they both served the same master (Ultima), so they got along well.</p><br/><p>Which was why, Veyron allowed Zonda to speak with him so casually.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh\u2026? That, is it something that can get me out of this \u201cpinch\u201d?\u300d</p><br/><p>To Veyron\u2019s repeated question,</p><br/><p>\u300cSure it can!\u300d</p><br/><p>He answered confidently.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cI shall show it to you now! This new ability of mine.</p><br/><p>Unique Skill\u300eChange Weapon\u300ftake that!!\u300d</p><br/><p>With his shout, his body began morphing into the form of a spear.</p><br/><p>The highly condensed mana of a Demon Noble, all concentrated into the form of a polished spear.</p><br/><p>It was only possible by Spirit Forms such as a demon.</p><br/><p>(Heh, how\u2019s that? Veldora-sama became a weapon too!</p><br/><p>I tried copying that. Boss\u2019 tendency to copy stuff rubbed off on me eh!) (EN: *tehe pero*)</p><br/><p>Zonda\u2019s spoke casually, while sounding excited.</p><br/><p>Why you little\u2026\u2026slacking off and watching Rimuru-sama\u2019s battle\u2026. Thought Veyron, but this happened all the time so he mind too much.</p><br/><p>And he turned the spear he created back into mana, and now grabbed ahold his new weapon, the transformed Zonda. (EN: *ahem* BL ship &lt;3)</p><br/><p>The crystallization of a demon\u2019s Energy.</p><br/><p>Normally you would cloak yourself in mana for defense, but this spear uses all that mana and turns that into the form of a spear.</p><br/><p>It was an incredibly dense amount of mana.</p><br/><p>Graneet sensed the danger that spear posed, and his face twitched in response. And,</p><br/><p>\u300cI won\u2019t allow that!! Hagun\u30fbGekishin Resshou!!\u300d(EN: Anti-Army \u30fb Quaking Sweep)</p><br/><p>He unleashed his killer move with all his might.</p><br/><p>But, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>With \u300eDemon Spear: Zonda \u300f in his hands, Veyron directed all of his mana onto defense instead of offense.</p><br/><p>Leaving the offense to Zonda, he decided to focus on defense.</p><br/><p>With that, he managed to survive Graneet\u2019s finishing move.</p><br/><p>Although he took great damage, he avoided death.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, it\u2019s our turn.\u300d</p><br/><p>Softly saying so, he perfectly traced of Hagun\u30fbGekishin Resshou with his Unique Skill\u300eTracer\u300f.</p><br/><p>The body\u2019s movements, and strength in each movement.</p><br/><p>Except, all of that using the physical abilities of a Demon, the difference was obvious.</p><br/><p>Discarding thoughts of attacking, he became force itself. With that, unleashed the attack, filled with the great Energy of a Demonic Noble.</p><br/><p>Although Graneet moved to intercept, as it was an attack he was very fluent at; he was unable to defend and ended up destroyed.</p><br/><p>The overwhelming power of the attack, caused the destruction of Graneet\u2019s body almost instantly, and turned him to dust. And without losing momentum, it raced across the deck of the airship, and ended up destroying some of the airships nearby in it\u2019s wake.</p><br/><p>Truly, it was a miniature version of the attack caused by the Veldora Sword.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood work, Zonda. This was first time you were actually of use.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t be so cold, Boss! I have always been of use\u2026\u2026\u300d(EN: *ahem* uke intensifies.)</p><br/><p>It was the same old casual conversation.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Veyron was mending the damage on his tailcoat along with the damage to himself.</p><br/><p>And good as new in a matter of seconds.</p><br/><p>This was where the real strength of Spirit Forms lied.</p><br/><p>And so, the two of them, headed back to their master, Ultima.</p><br/><p>(EN: Author\u2019s words)</p><br/><p>Getting to the Demons\u2019 fights took much longer than I thought.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The one who brings destruction to this world.</p><br/><p>Today, on this day and at this time, I declare a war to the residents of the entire world.</p><br/><p>Life or death.</p><br/><p>All of you should fight as hard as possible. Well then, shall we begin? Armageddon (The Final War)!\u300f</p><br/><p>Those words became the signal of the start.</p><br/><p>From the huge gate that appeared in the sky, armies of angels spring out in succession.</p><br/><p>The world was immediately wrapped in chaos.</p><br/><p>Oh dear, we received a preemptive strike.</p><br/><p>By the oath from Velda, the former Angra Mainyu, thus the game begins.</p><br/><p>However, Velda huh.</p><br/><p>Angra Mainyu having that name means that there is no trace of Yuuki\u2019s personality anymore.</p><br/><p>Though I don\u2019t know what kind of effect it had, I did comprehend that a completely different plan was put into motion.</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t care whether it is Velda or something else, I will beat him speechless!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah that\u2019s right. There is no reason to trouble Rimuru-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. Considering that I want to go out and see places I never seen, wishing for world destruction is unacceptable.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ul, Testa and Carrera are talking as they please.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s me, I would be more careful of Yuuki, though I feel this is not an easy task.</p><br/><p>I wonder from where did these three\u2019s confidence come from.</p><br/><p>The situation of each country is projected by my surveillance magic on several large screens which I installed in the control room, which is in the Joint Operations Headquarters.</p><br/><p>The situation is not good, yet it is not the worst either. Due to prior communications, the governing body of each country were able to expect this situation.</p><br/><p>Though with limited time, the arrangements for the evacuation instructions to the people were put in order. The problem is the chaos that will occur due to the prolonged war and food shortage.</p><br/><p>Hinata is also cooperating in leading the people, so the evacuation was finished by yesterday. The people who were doubting it before, are now quiet.</p><br/><p>I wonder till when this status will keep.</p><br/><p>Right now, people who were confused by fear and people who complained because of their anxiety are few. However, such people will increase as time passes.</p><br/><p>The people in the capital cities, where the evacuation is completed, only have enough food for about a week.</p><br/><p>Because the help hasn\u2019t reached the people of the rural areas, only a warning was conveyed. Later, under the command of the local government, in the current situation, each of them will cope with it by themselves.</p><br/><p>I think that a considerable amount of effort will be needed just to maintain the current state.</p><br/><p>Because The Great War has occurred every 500 years, only the shelters are prepared.</p><br/><p>In each country\u2019s capital, the shelter for the citizens is prepared inside a cavern in the nearby mountains or underground.</p><br/><p>Although some, more or less, preserved food is stored, it is unable to satisfy all of the citizens whom exceed tens of thousands.</p><br/><p>According to the record of the Great Wars up til now, the number of angels seemed to increase in a single week. As such, it is unclear what will happen this time.</p><br/><p>Although preparation was greater than in the past, I expect that riots will occur in the case that The Great War is prolonged.</p><br/><p>It only depends on the circumstances, but it was depressing to think that, in the worst case, I might need to use soldiers to suppress the riots.</p><br/><p>How will the angels move? That\u2019s the main problem.</p><br/><p>Different from what has happened in the past, now that the angels have a will of their own, what will be the main focus of their armies\u2019 attacks?</p><br/><p>Will they focus on us, the opposing forces? Or, in order to bring us together, will they focus their attacks at the human nations?</p><br/><p>My surveillance magic is effective in verifying that.</p><br/><p>And so, I could observe all of the important locations by projecting images of them.</p><br/><p>The preparation was complete, I can instantly grasp the angels\u2019 movements.</p><br/><p>The \u201cPalace of White Ice\u201d on the ice continent where Guy resides.</p><br/><p>The magic city that Leon rules, \u201cEl Dorado\u201d.</p><br/><p>The Holy Empire Ruberios where Ruminas has concealed herself.</p><br/><p>The Palace Reaching Heaven[1], the castle of the giants\u2019 kingdom which Dagruel rules.</p><br/><p>Every capital city and major city of the western countries.</p><br/><p>Every big city that exists as important locations as well as the East Empire\u2019s capital.</p><br/><p>And near the center of the land with the vast abundant harvests that spreads through the south of Great Jura Forest, a castle with white walls, built by the people who admired Milim, stood there elegantly, it was the castle of Milim, the \u201cDestroyer\u201d.</p><br/><p>Every place was projected clearly on the large screens.</p><br/><p>Immediately after the war declaration was done, the army of angels sprung forth from the huge gate that appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>However, it was primarily a bluff.</p><br/><p>Their focus was concentrated on four points.</p><br/><p>First of all, Guy was excluded because Chloe was sent to deal with him instead.</p><br/><p>With this, as expected, there was no need for additional forces.</p><br/><p>Then, the problem are the 4 places in question\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>First of all is \u201cEl Dorado\u201d. An army of 200.000 angels of different sizes and qualities had invaded it.</p><br/><p>The next is Holy Empire Ruberios. An army of 200.000 is also attacking this place.</p><br/><p>The third place is Milim\u2019s castle, the White Wall Castle. An army of 200.000 also appeared there.</p><br/><p>And the last place is right overhead, the outside of the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>In other words, our country, an army of 400.000 angels are attacking here.</p><br/><p>Hey, why is it that only my place got twice the number?</p><br/><p>I wish that the forces went to Dagruel-ossan\u2019s place too. In that case, we could crush them with a swift attack.</p><br/><p>I thought about such a na\u00efve thing, but the situation doesn\u2019t seem like it will be so convenient.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s gather all of the Demon Lords in one place, everyone can defeat them, right!\u201d so I insisted, but the scene of me being looked at by everyone with cold eyes, is still fresh in my memory.</p><br/><p>The reason for it is because it is against the aesthetics! Or something like that.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t care about aesthetics, I only want to settle the problem quickly\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Somehow, the only thing that they consented to was aid during emergencies.</p><br/><p>I had prepared the transfer magic formation, with much effort, for the plan I had in mind, however I failed in the persuasion.</p><br/><p>I consulted with Ciel and agreed that there\u2019s a margin of flexibility in it, unfortunately this plan was still rejected.</p><br/><p>If we had executed that plan, we could have been predominantly advantageous when the angel army dispersed\u2026\u2026 sadly it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Oh well, the Demon Lords are not my subordinates, and not colleagues that can be trusted either.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s something like a miracle that they can cooperate with each other. So, I\u2019m okay with such a result.</p><br/><p>The progress of the war is hardly satisfactory, the enemy is good enough to divide the forces that could deal with our side.</p><br/><p>If they had spared some of their forces towards Dagruel, then it is likely that the angels will still have an even force against us though.</p><br/><p>The angel forces seem to be moving into a slightly advantageous situation. It\u2019s as if they had counted our forces\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300aAs expected, I concluded that there is a betrayer among the Demon Lords\u300b</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ciel give me a warning.</p><br/><p>Although Ciel had pointed it out some time ago, I said that I disagree with the timing when Dino showed his true nature.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think about Dino to that extent, so I laughed it off\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, since the war has begun now, it is unnatural if they don\u2019t attack when there is an opportunity to do so, or so Ciel insisted.</p><br/><p>However, there\u2019s no definite evidence, and each Demon Lord doesn\u2019t have any motive for it either.</p><br/><p>They spent the trump card that is Chloe to block the intervention of Guy, therefore Guy is out of question.</p><br/><p>I can exclude Leon and Ruminas because of their ties to Chloe too.</p><br/><p>Ramiris and Milim are out of question.</p><br/><p>That only leaves Dagruel, however, his upright character as a soldier makes him the number one unlikeliest to be the betrayer.</p><br/><p>It is certain that he was close to Dino, but he has continued to fight against the angels since the ancient times and didn\u2019t seem to betray in those times.</p><br/><p>Also, his three sons are being worked hard by Shion, and are training here. If he intended to betray us, surely he wouldn\u2019t entrust his sons to the enemy.</p><br/><p>This side didn\u2019t suggest it either, it was a request from him.</p><br/><p>As such I had rejected the opinion, and believed that Ciel was just thinking too much.</p><br/><p>(Dagruel is the betrayer?)</p><br/><p>\u300aDagruel has the highest probability of being the betrayer.</p><br/><p>Yet I cannot throw away the possibility that Ruminas is the one either.</p><br/><p>If Dagruel moves, his betrayal will be confirmed.</p><br/><p>If Ruminas asks for help without moving, Ruminas is the betrayer.\u300b</p><br/><p>There seems to be a possibility that Dagruel is not the betrayer.</p><br/><p>Is that so? Currently, An army of 200.000 angels are against Ruminas. Additionally, Ruminas has her own troops. If reinforcements went there, without a doubt they would be annihilated, huh?</p><br/><p>Even if there were no reinforcements, at least in the current situation, Ruminas would have a hard fight, yet surely she wouldn\u2019t defeated.</p><br/><p>The battle might be hanging in the balance, but it won\u2019t be one-sided. In that case, the proud-hearted vampire princess would not request for help.</p><br/><p>But even so, in the case that Dagruel moves to aid Ruminas even when she doesn\u2019t request for help\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Dagruel\u2019s troops would turn their fangs towards Ruminas.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Certainly, in that case the betrayer would become known.</p><br/><p>They not only divided their forces, they allocated it in a way that could deal with us, with the intention to crush each and every Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Each Demon Lord does not have much in the way of surplus troops and it might have been anticipated that there are not enough spare troops to be sent as reinforcements.</p><br/><p>And it will be uncertain which one is telling the truth if I check the situation with only telepathic communication.</p><br/><p>Distrust will rise among us and our cooperation will collapse as well. After I saw through this plan, I realized that it is a cunning strategy.</p><br/><p>They had Dino betray us once so as get our guards down, in the expectation that we would deem that there would be no further betrayals. To be honest, if Ciel-sensei was not here, I\u2019m certain that I would have gotten caught in that plan.</p><br/><p>That would only be in the case that she was not here, as that plan has already been completely seen through.</p><br/><p>With surveillance magic, I can perfectly grasp the placement of the enemy forces. It is the enemy\u2019s miscalculation, the chances of victory seems to be in our favor.</p><br/><p>Although I made the transfer magic formation with much effort, it is not a thing which can be activated by every army.</p><br/><p>So, I will not need to be so afraid even if someone defects. As it is not possible to transfer to inside the labyrinth with the magic formation.</p><br/><p>I only would only tell each Demon Lord to seal the power of the transfer formation once the matter of the betrayer is settled.</p><br/><p>(Okay, keep investigating the situation without stopping!)</p><br/><p>\u300aYes, understood, Master!\u300b</p><br/><p>Saying that there is a betrayer from the very beginning of the war is not pleasant.</p><br/><p>Truly, it is an omen that it\u2019ll become a few nasty battles.</p><br/><p>At the time that I was gloomily thinking such, I hardly believed my eyes when I saw a harder to believe scene.</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s army is being pushed back.</p><br/><p>Impossible! The former Demon Lords, Karion and Frey are over there, and yet\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, there was a change to Milim\u2019s castle which was projected on the screen. In a section of the castle, an explosion occurred.</p><br/><p>It seems the situation has become worse than I expected.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>When the gate appeared in the sky, and angels had begun to pour out from it, Milim had been warming up for the war in high spirits.</p><br/><p>A mob of angels is not a worthy foe for Milim.</p><br/><p>She can rely on the subordinates whom she trained herself, and there\u2019s Karion who received the position of general.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm, in that case, I\u2019m going out for a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying such, lightly, Karion stands up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go, all you rascals!!\u2019 When Karion issued his command, he gets on his griffon and proceeds to intercept the enemy.</p><br/><p>Milim watched the situation while getting excited.</p><br/><p>But the situation changed completely with the appearance of a single man.</p><br/><p>\u300cYours truly is one of the Four Fiends of the Heaven Commanders, Vega! All you small fries don\u2019t even pass the qualifications to be food for this great me.</p><br/><p>Stop your useless resistance and quickly be eaten by me!\u300d</p><br/><p>The man shouted such with a loud voice and began to slaughter Karion\u2019s beastman subordinates.</p><br/><p>Even the most earliest soldiers who have been following Karion since the period of the Beast Kingdom \u201cYuurazania\u201d, all turned pale at the man\u2019s dreadful power.</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s currently assembled troops have been assembled through the reorganization of the forces of her area.</p><br/><p>The command of the whole army is left to Karion who took the position of general.</p><br/><p>Their total number is 300.000.</p><br/><p>At the center of them was the 3.000 units titled \u201cFlying Beast Knight Order\u201d.</p><br/><p>3.000 griffons of \u201cSky Queen\u201d Frey\u2019s forces and mounted on their back are the specially picked beastmen of \u201cBeast King\u201d Karion\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re merely 3.000 people but they are warriors who exceed A rank who are able to easily do high speed air battle as one effective body.</p><br/><p>In this world, this is the largest force composed only of people who exceed A rank.</p><br/><p>Even the Empire\u2019s magic beast corps was composed of \u201cA-\u201c rank, so it could be easily to comprehend that they are a significant forces.</p><br/><p>Griffons are originally magic beasts with \u201cB+\u201d rank.</p><br/><p>But, with the result of the training given by Karion, their ability was raised to \u201cA-\u201c rank.</p><br/><p>As with the A rank beastmen who rode them, their ability became equivalent to A rank.</p><br/><p>The Flying Beast Knight Order is the strongest subordinates who were trained by Karion in both name and reality.</p><br/><p>The rest are the devils, mercenaries and Clayman\u2019s former subordinates. It is a combined force consisting of various people.</p><br/><p>Even the people who usually take part in maintaining the public order were roped into the war.</p><br/><p>Opposing the angel forces of 200.000 is Milim\u2019s army of 300.000.</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s army has the advantage in number but they are somewhat disadvantaged as their ability quality is average.</p><br/><p>Even so, there is the effect of increasing their ability due to Karion\u2019s courageous shout, therefore in the beginning they held the superiority in the battle, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Due to the appearance of the man named; Vega of the Four Fiends of the Heaven Commanders, the situation has completely changed.</p><br/><p>\u300cHumph! Useless, useless, utterly useless! None of you small fries can injure me!\u300d</p><br/><p>He shouted such as he swung around the Sky Piercing Halberd[2] that he held in his hand.</p><br/><p>With just one swing, a mountain of corpses is made in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2018Grr!\u2019 So Karion ground his teeth as he glared at the provocative Vega.</p><br/><p>With just a glance, Karion understood that Vega is different from the other angels. Even if he fights with that man, or even if he deployed the entirety of his treasured \u201cFlying Beast Knight Order\u201d, they would probably get annihilated.</p><br/><p>Along with Milim, Frey and her aides, \u201cHarpy\u201d are waiting.</p><br/><p>The dirty work is for himself to deal with, the rest he may entrust to Frey.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, I\u2019m going to fight that cocky bastard Vega.</p><br/><p>And so, I entrust the command of the entire army to you, take care of the rest!\u300d</p><br/><p>Which is what he told his aide, the tiger beastman Baum.</p><br/><p>\u300c Karion-sama, that guy is\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t I be that guy\u2019s first opponent so that you can check his weaknesses, even if just a little?\u300d</p><br/><p>Karion shook his head at Baum\u2019s idea.</p><br/><p>In the case of the angel\u2019s army, they have no unity, they are only attacking at random.</p><br/><p>If it is so, although his own army is inferior on average, they are advantageous with their numbers, which exceed the number of enemies, and their united command.</p><br/><p>In this situation, such folly like \u2018the commander is not around\u2019 cannot be permitted to happen. In case a Baum weakens Vega\u2019s power and Karion delivers the finishing blow, that strategy would be worth consideration. Unfortunately, Baum wouldn\u2019t even slow that man down.</p><br/><p>His intuition from his battle experience as the Beast King told him that the man named Vega is not an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo Baum, you wouldn\u2019t even buy any time. It\u2019d be a big loss if there isn\u2019t someone giving orders.</p><br/><p>While I fight that guy one on one, you defeat the angels!\u300d</p><br/><p>Baum realized, the enemy who calls himself Vega has an unprecedented amount of strength, from Karion\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>For Karion who has an optimistic and frank character, that strained expression is similar to the expression Karion showed before his fight with Milim sometime ago.</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course, a person who can only talk, won\u2019t be a threat if it\u2019s Karion-sama.</p><br/><p>You can leave the command of the army to me! However, please refrain from the behavior of leaving the work to Frey-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh crap. If you owe a debt to Frey, it\u2019ll be harsh when she comes to collect the debt.\u300d</p><br/><p>The two, both joking with each other, then part ways.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t leave the work to Frey\u2019, in other words, he meant \u2018Please don\u2019t die\u2019.</p><br/><p>Worrying about Karion, who is the strongest Beast King, is something that an aide should never do.</p><br/><p>That strength is absolute, the name of \u201cBeast King\u201d is not just for show.</p><br/><p>As the general, who is the right hand of the strongest Demon Lord Milim, Karion needs to continue his reign.</p><br/><p>(What a thing to say, even though I lost as the Lion Mask.)</p><br/><p>Karion recalled his defeat at the hands of Diablo during the Tournament in Tempest.</p><br/><p>That country there, is abnormal.</p><br/><p>Because even that Diablo who defeated him, was defeated in the finals.</p><br/><p>It had taught him that there is always someone better, his self-conceit was finally shattered. After that he endured grueling training and obtained strength greater than he had during his Demon Lord time.</p><br/><p>It will be a hard fight, but Karion doesn\u2019t have any intention to be defeated whatsoever.</p><br/><p>(That reminds me, Gobuta\u2026\u2026 I wonder if he\u2019s doing well \u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>The face of his friend who trained together with him came to mind.</p><br/><p>When he remembers that genius who even Karion admits to having abnormal talent that surpasses his own race, he feels happy.</p><br/><p>(At best, not getting laughed at by that guy might be the proof that I became strong!)</p><br/><p>When Karion sprouted a fearless smile, he charged towards Vega.</p><br/><p>When Karion clashed with Vega, a fierce battle began.</p><br/><p>Frey pacified Milim who struggled to go there herself.</p><br/><p>If Milim, who can\u2019t go easy on anyone, is rampaging seriously, it will not only be the town around the castle that vanishes, but there\u2019ll also be casualties among the ally troops as well.</p><br/><p>The current situation, it seems there is a dangerous guy from the enemy side, but Frey believes that Karion can deal with it.</p><br/><p>In the case that Karion is defeated, then, and only then, would it be Milim\u2019s turn. Therefore, right now, she needs to watch the way Karion fights, deciding that she needs to analyze the abilities of the enemy.</p><br/><p>As Karion\u2019s aide, she was going to do so and have Karion work hard for Milim\u2019s sake.</p><br/><p>Frey is cold-hearted and calculating, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she has never trusted Karion. Rather, because she believed that Karion might defeat Vega which would prevent Milim going out.</p><br/><p>After all, Frey cannot imagine a battle maniac like him having a hard fight with a person whom she has never heard the name of.</p><br/><p>Frey who is not specialized in combat was not able to see the truth of Vega\u2019s terror.</p><br/><p>She thought that they could win without having a hard time, even if by any chance Karion had a hard time, so long as Milim analyzed the enemy's power.</p><br/><p>But she will immediately notice that her thinking was na\u00efve.</p><br/><p>If Milim, who is the leader, can defeat the enemy without a problem, a small sacrifice may be unavoidable.</p><br/><p>That is what Frey thought, when Milim was watching Karion\u2019s fight.</p><br/><p>That is, until Milim turned around with a fierce expression.</p><br/><p>This presence is not an ordinary one, of course Frey, and even the \u201cHarpy\u201d are alerted.</p><br/><p>Besides Frey, the others don\u2019t sense anything like an unidentified presence, but Milim\u2019s intuition cannot be mistaken.</p><br/><p>\u300cWho are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>When Milim asked that, the space mutated it\u2019s color slowly, and a woman appeared.</p><br/><p>A woman with beautiful silver hair, similar to Milim.</p><br/><p>A \u201cmatchless in beauty\u201d woman who seems like an adult version of Milim.</p><br/><p>Her white skin and the gaze of her almond-shaped eyes.</p><br/><p>Frey gasped. The appearance is too beautiful, and reminds her of her beloved master.</p><br/><p>There is a sign that lets you feel that the two resemble each other closely, as if there is blood connection between the two.</p><br/><p>Four pure white angels kneel in the rear, to protect the woman.</p><br/><p>Their aura are overwhelming and each of them has power equivalent to an awakened Demon Lord, Frey was able to feel it too.</p><br/><p>\u300cNice to meet you, Milim Nava-sama.</p><br/><p>I am the one who holds the name, \u201cLucia\u201d.</p><br/><p>This time I have visited to meet you.</p><br/><p>Your father is waiting for you. Please, let us go together.\u300d</p><br/><p>The woman who introduced herself as Lucia greets and bows to Milim respectfully.</p><br/><p>And then she let out those shocking words.</p><br/><p>A shock ran through them.</p><br/><p>If you are talking about Milim\u2019s father, it would be the late \u201cStellar Dragon King\u201d Veldanava.</p><br/><p>A little while ago, the person who was shown on the image that appeared in the sky had introduced himself as Velda, it couldn\u2019t be\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When Frey thought so,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t be silly! My father is already dead. If you keep saying this nonsense, I will end your life!\u300d</p><br/><p>Frey heard Milim\u2019s enraged voice.</p><br/><p>Of course. For Milim, the topic of her family is taboo.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it is the truth. Milim-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>Immediately after the woman said that, a thunderous roar resounded in front of the of the woman who introduced herself as Lucia.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s Milim\u2019s fist that went towards Lucia\u2019s face, yet was stopped as if it was blocked by an invisible wall.</p><br/><p>Frey was able to tell, Milim threw her fist with all her power and she did not stop it to threaten the woman.</p><br/><p>Seeing Lucia who remained calm, even after receiving a full power blow from Milim, it made Frey feel shivers run down her back.</p><br/><p>Even if she\u2019s going easy on someone, her title as the \u201cDestroyer\u201d is not for show.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s impossible to completely block it, even if using Multiple Barriers.</p><br/><p>The reason why is because when Milim attacks, the power is dispersed and not to the extent of killing the opponent. In other words, Milim who threw out the attack with a calculated power in order to break the target\u2019s barrier and yet not kill the target.</p><br/><p>For her to remain calm, it\u2019s nothing but that she had exceeded Milim\u2019s assumptions.</p><br/><p>Such a thing was something that couldn\u2019t happen as far as Frey knows.</p><br/><p>After all, Milim is the strongest Demon Lord, rivaling Guy Crimson\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is useless, Milim-sama. Attacks toward me will not be effective whatsoever.</p><br/><p>What is more important is that your father is waiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the new world, let us live together!\u201d is what he said.</p><br/><p>Please come with me.\u300d</p><br/><p>Although she is beautiful, Lucia repeats the same words like a machine.</p><br/><p>Her voice resounding coldly, without any emotion that could be felt from it, it painted Frey\u2019s mind with uneasiness.</p><br/><p>(Return immediately, Karion! Milim-sama may be in danger.)</p><br/><p>(What did you say!? But, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026 I may not be able come back\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>Unlike Frey\u2019s expectations, the man who Karion was fighting against seems to be a more powerful person than she had expected.</p><br/><p>For Karion who is a confident person to have no time to spare, Frey was able to understand that he is having a hard fight.</p><br/><p>This is bad! As Frey thinks so,</p><br/><p>\u300cKill her!\u300d</p><br/><p>She gave an order to the \u201cHarpy\u201d without waiting for Milim\u2019s approval.</p><br/><p>Frey had merely judged that it would be dangerous for Milim, if she let this woman keep on doing as she likes.</p><br/><p>Because their beloved Master is too gentle to the extent that could be fatal.</p><br/><p>If she really tried to kill her opponent then she wouldn\u2019t have a hard fight regardless who the opponent is, but she didn\u2019t fight seriously because she is trying not kill to her opponent. As far as Frey knows, the last time Milim fought seriously was a long time ago. Frey had just been born around that time, Milim destroyed a country and then clashed with Guy.</p><br/><p>Because Milim is such a gentle master, Frey wishes to keep her away from as much danger as much as she can.</p><br/><p>\u300cFool.\u300d</p><br/><p>One of the kneeling angels stood up and materialized a war hammer.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>\u300cYou insects who cling to Milim-sama should know your place!</p><br/><p>Die! Lightning Bomber!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The angel swung down the war hammer and a destructive lightning which exhibited a tremendous amount of power struck towards Frey and the others.</p><br/><p>Frey prepared for her death when she saw the despair-inducing, destructive electric discharge that was released from the war hammer.</p><br/><p>The released lightning ran through Frey\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the \u201cHarpies\u201d who began an attack towards Lucia were also annihilated with only that single blow.</p><br/><p>Though it was an overkill attack that struck Frey and the others, they seemed to barely avoid their deaths, somehow.</p><br/><p>Frey mustered her strength to stay conscious in her injured body that could break any moment as she confirmed the cause.</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s left arm had caught the war hammer that was swung down toward Frey and the others.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Milim, they had barely survived.</p><br/><p>(Ah, Milim is so kind. As I expected, you are not really cut out to kill.)</p><br/><p>Thus she thought so.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, she froze when she saw Milim\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>It was an expression of rage.</p><br/><p>Milim flew into a rage as Frey and the others, who are her subordinates, were injured.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will not forgive you. To injure my subordinates, I will never forgive this!!\u300d</p><br/><p>So Milim shouts.</p><br/><p>And then, light is released from Milim\u2019s body and wrap her in it.</p><br/><p>She wore the God class armor on her body as she switched to Battle Mode.</p><br/><p>She carries the power of a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d in her body, and Milim who had become the incarnation of destruction let loose that power.</p><br/><p>The heaven trembles, the earth shatters.</p><br/><p>By the anger of an ancient Demon Lord, the world rumbled.</p><br/><p>Frey was astonished as she realized the enemy\u2019s aim.</p><br/><p>It is good if Milim accepts the invitation. In the case where she declines it\u2026\u2026 make her fly into a rage that deprives her of her senses.</p><br/><p>And like now\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(Not good! Don\u2019t do it, Milim!!)</p><br/><p>Frey who tried to stop Milim with a soundless voice. However, her voice couldn\u2019t reach Milim.</p><br/><p>The world will once again be exposed to the wrath of the ultimate dragonoid.</p><br/><p>[1]  Tsutenkaku, there\u2019s also a tower with the same name and it's a well-known landmark of Osaka.  can mean tower or palace</p><br/><p>[2]  Houtengeki, the famous weapon used by warlord Lu Bu in the \"Three Kingdoms\" period in China.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

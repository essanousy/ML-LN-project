Thus, it was also easy to produce it en masse.</p><br/><p>However, the distance and the amount of information transferred is dependent on the user, as it consumes the user\u2019s magical power to function.</p><br/><p>This inconvenience was improved using the magical power integration system, but it\u2019s best that I not say that.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnyway, it seems that in the case of you, something which could be used in the military, is also usable for entertainment.\u300d</p><br/><p>I was told that with amazement.</p><br/><p>However, it had an excellent effect on publicity.</p><br/><p>The empress of The Magic Dynasty of Sarion quickly offered cooperation.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you\u2019d like, would you want financial support?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAhh, perhaps we would head towards that direction in time. However if we could get some experts on Magitech that would be a real life saver.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFumu, I got it. We\u2019ll return and review this immediately\uff01\u300d</p><br/><p>She left with Duke Elalude after saying that.</p><br/><p>arion\u2019s empress had the expression of a child with a new toy, brimming with delight. Compared to the depressed duke, the difference was impressive.</p><br/><p>I already believe that compared to the initial technology agreement, it\u2019s only a matter of time before full-fledged joint research begins between us.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf King prepared a technological research team at home, promised to send them forth to the monster country tempest, before leaving as well.</p><br/><p>So far, so good.</p><br/><p>Then, a problem occurred.</p><br/><p>First, the Tengu clan.</p><br/><p>I was visited in private after the competition, and I was greeted with the words,</p><br/><p>\u300eI was very rude the other day, and am sorry!</p><br/><p>I humbly come to thee to plead for forgiveness!!\u300f</p><br/><p>Everyone came to apologise.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s good.</p><br/><p>Because I didn\u2019t think their actions were much of a problem I wasn\u2019t bothered all that much.</p><br/><p>However, here\u2019s the problem.</p><br/><p>\u300cTherefore, if, as a means of apologizing\u2026\u2026,</p><br/><p>I would like to be allowed to serve under Benimaru and become his bride!\u300d</p><br/><p>Huh? What\u2019s she saying?!</p><br/><p>The grand daughter of the Tengu elder, Momiji, dropped such a bomb.</p><br/><p>When you think about it, she has quite the reckless straight-forward personality.</p><br/><p>I looked at Benimaru and for an instant he was thunderstruck by the news and fell into panic. Begging with his eyes, saying \u201cNo way, no way!\u201d</p><br/><p>But then, I thought,</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this fine? This is something between those two, if I get involved it would only get confusing.</p><br/><p>As they always say, \u201cA wise man never courts trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s my style to avoid these troublesome situations.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, about that\u2026 ask the person in question.</p><br/><p>Outsiders shouldn\u2019t interfere, should they?\u300d</p><br/><p>There was extra emphasis on Outsider, and I decided to leave the talking to Benimaru.</p><br/><p>The executives showed their approval in response to my words.</p><br/><p>Seems like none of us wanted to get involved.</p><br/><p>And so, good luck Benimaru! I think that should suffice as the reward for winning the tournament, so flirt to your hearts content!</p><br/><p>Whilst cheering him on in my heart, the problem was postponed.</p><br/><p>The issue with the Tengu tribe was left to Benimaru, and I decided to stay out of it completely.</p><br/><p>Irresponsible? I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about</p><br/><p>And, when one problem was left aside, another comes up.</p><br/><p>And this problem is the cause of my recent headaches.</p><br/><p>and that problem is\u2026</p><br/><p>Dungeon conquering did not go as well as expected.</p><br/><p>The first layer had no traps, and it was meant to help get use to the atmosphere of the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Thus, I though it would be in the level where clearing it within a day would be possible.</p><br/><p>However, three days had passed and there were no signs of anyone clearing it.</p><br/><p>There were even parties who were killed by C rank monsters.</p><br/><p>Or rather, there were a lot.</p><br/><p>Blinded by greed, those fools rushed towards the treasure box without even noticing the monsters hiding in the corner of the room.</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t get the basics. In a nutshell, their sense of danger is sorely lacking!</p><br/><p>In addition, the monsters wandering around were mainly small fry F ranks.</p><br/><p>There were mainly E ranks, and some D ranks in the mix, but this was ultimately a failure.</p><br/><p>There were also fools who challenged it alone, and were promptly slaughtered by 3 E rank monsters.</p><br/><p>There were also those who met D ranked ones, and were quickly killed.</p><br/><p>They were so low leveled they left me speechless.</p><br/><p>However the problem was not so bad as to induce panic yet.</p><br/><p>The challengers this time are a bouncer and a mercenary; prideful guys who we no good at exploration.</p><br/><p>Even though I waited, no one had cleared it after three days.</p><br/><p>There are even those who had given up in their midst.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a given though.</p><br/><p>Since the save point is located every 10 levels, if you don\u2019t bring in large quantities of rations, you\u2019ll soon go hungry.</p><br/><p>And as they got lost, and couldn\u2019t decide if they should go for the exit.</p><br/><p>They were advised to stockpile on provisions and equipment at the beginning, but they didn\u2019t heed it.</p><br/><p>If I seriously designed the dungeon to kill them, there wouldn\u2019t be a single successful conqueror even after 100 years.</p><br/><p>I guess we need to reconsider it all from bottom up.</p><br/><p>And this is what has been making my head hurt recently.</p><br/><p>At this rate things are going to take a turn for the worse.</p><br/><p>No, the number of dungeon conquerors is not a problem</p><br/><p>If there are magic stones, a small bit of profit could be procured, and thus there are quite the amount of people entering the dungeon one after the other.</p><br/><p>When the influential magnates returned to their respective countries, they seem to have posted requests for people to conquer the dungeon, amongst them are some who have thoroughly prepared.</p><br/><p>However, they are in the minority, and those with sloppy preparations make up the majority.</p><br/><p>And thus, an evaluation meeting.</p><br/><p>The participants are me, Veldora, Ramiris, and as an observer Masayuki.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, judging from the current situation, it\u2019s completely no good.</p><br/><p>Our enjoyment, that\u2019s not it, I believe in order for there to be some successful conquerors we should give some a bit of guidance.\u300d</p><br/><p>At this rate they wouldn\u2019t even reach the 10th floor.</p><br/><p>I mean, what kind of idiot even tries to take on the labyrinth alone?!</p><br/><p>After all, they wouldn\u2019t even notice their lack of alertness if we don\u2019t point it all.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd thus, the first level was designed for the sake of getting the feeling,</p><br/><p>should I turn it into a \u201cathletic stage\u201d where monsters don\u2019t spawn?</p><br/><p>In this level, you get to learn about traps, have combat training with monsters\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, we can also use it for soldier training for the recruits of the Monster Country. What do you think?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHm, my opinions, I believe they\u2019re too soft.</p><br/><p>To some degree, I\u2019d want them undergo training, to get a feel on their arms\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI think so too!</p><br/><p>If Milim were there, they would have all been sent blasting off in a fit of fury!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus the creators of the dungeon were completely blasting the challengers rather than discussing the difficulty of the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, there should also be lessons on the basics of dungeon capturing.</p><br/><p>Like a tutorial.\u300d</p><br/><p>After Masayuki\u2019s casual remark, we looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u300cChuchorial? What\u2019s that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt sounds tasty, is it edible?\u300d</p><br/><p>I though Veldora would know about it, but if not even Veldora knows about it, then there\u2019s no way Ramiris would.</p><br/><p>Thus Masayuki and I described what a tutorial was.</p><br/><p>The two were convinced.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat sounds great. I get it! Let\u2019s set it up at once!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris nodded.</p><br/><p>But,</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, please wait a moment. I have also noticed something else.</p><br/><p>What about installing inns and meals on each save point?</p><br/><p>Or rather, if they\u2019re all spatially connected by a door we would only need one such area right?</p><br/><p>This way, people who didn\u2019t prepare before hand would use it even if it\u2019s expensive\u300d</p><br/><p>TN Note: you know what to do :3</p><br/><p>What was that?</p><br/><p>Is this guy\u2026 a genius?!</p><br/><p>Ramiris directed her line of sight towards him, nodded strongly, and returned to us.</p><br/><p>\u300cMasayuki Kun, we\u2019ll try to adopt your idea.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s anything else you have in mind, do not hesitate to speak up.\u300d</p><br/><p>While I encouraged him, Masauki was in thought, and recalling a game he once played.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right\u2026</p><br/><p>For example, maybe save points that are single use only?</p><br/><p>Only having a save point once every 10 floors will probably be too difficult.</p><br/><p>Although I think it would probably be best to rid them of their dependence in less than 30 floors\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At least until the 20th floor, lets leave a little bit of sweetness in their dungeon capturing experience.\u300d</p><br/><p>Fumu.</p><br/><p>TN note: As previously mentioned, Japanese equivalent of hm.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, I though so too!</p><br/><p>What Masayuki said is reasonable!\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora quickly hopped aboard on with Masayuki\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>Well, I don\u2019t have any objections either.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, then I\u2019ll prepare hidden room on each floor, connecting it to the dining hall on the 95th floor.</p><br/><p>This will also increase the usefulness of that town.</p><br/><p>Then, to implement a drop item that can create a save point anywhere.</p><br/><p>Is this possible, Ramiris?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course~! There\u2019s even room to spare</p><br/><p>The item name is Record Orb, let\u2019s make it as a rare drop from small fries!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Great great.</p><br/><p>The first floor should be for gathering prior experiences in addition to announcements.</p><br/><p>Whether a person uses it or not is up to them, and it\u2019s set so that they can\u2019t die in this floor.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a mechanism that allows them to revive on the spot. Like a children\u2019s playground.</p><br/><p>Then, the 2nd floor would allow virtual battles with all sorts of monsters.</p><br/><p>It should be able to reproduce the encountering experience to a certain degree, and it should help with capturing the dungeon.</p><br/><p>However, unique monsters and boss monsters are excluded as possible targets.</p><br/><p>That would be way too convenient.</p><br/><p>Thus on the 2nd floor each person would feel like they have flew into a personal space.</p><br/><p>The real thing starts on the 3rd floor.</p><br/><p>However, there will be no traps installed on the 3rd floor, and the demons that roam the halls are also low leveled, only F ranks.</p><br/><p>I only placed E ranked ones in one section of the area, along with a treasure chest containing potions.</p><br/><p>Expensive goods will start appearing at floor 5 and below.</p><br/><p>Just like that, I also though about making adjustments and changed the level of difficulty.</p><br/><p>Even in game developing, there would be a certain degree of unreasonableness after closed testing.</p><br/><p>Actually, tentatively, the test is being carried out.</p><br/><p>However, the ones doing the capturing are 6 members of \u201cYomigaeri\u201d under Shion\u2019s commands.</p><br/><p>We were able to capture down to the 40th floor without any problems.</p><br/><p>Well, we didn\u2019t arrange a stay on the 30th floor.</p><br/><p>However, even with the traps and small fries, the capture proceeded without much struggle.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, we had noticed we made a mistake in the assumption of the labyrinth\u2019s difficulty level.</p><br/><p>We must choose our testers carefully.</p><br/><p>This will be a future challenge.</p><br/><p>Thus, we had hosted a evaluation meeting, and remade a new dungeon.</p><br/><p>Myormiles had sent a request and presented a reward for people to capture the dungeon to the branches of the Freedom Association in each nation.</p><br/><p>He is doing his job well.</p><br/><p>Weights were placed on Gozuru\u2019s wrists and feet, while he stands guard on the 30th floor.</p><br/><p>The mezu, now named Mezuru, also defends that floor in shifts.</p><br/><p>The 50th floor will also be guarded by either Mezuru or Gozuru, but without their restraints.</p><br/><p>I hope they could get along as fellow defenders.</p><br/><p>The 95th floor will be the town of the Elves and the Treants (Planned), and with the cooperation of Gerudo and Mildo, the place was finished with a beautiful and fantastical touch.</p><br/><p>Even though it\u2019s underground, there\u2019s the sun and the sky, even stars can be seen at night.</p><br/><p>And thus, the labyrinth\u2019s appearance changes everyday, giving it a fresh new touch.</p><br/><p>TN Note: Think the mystery dungeon series.</p><br/><p>And finally, adventurers banning together to form capturing teams, has arrived in the Monster Country Tempest at last.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

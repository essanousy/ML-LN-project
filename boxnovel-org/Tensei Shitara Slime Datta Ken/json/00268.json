I was casually checking the bracelet just now and something crazy is going on with my points! For some reason my points have risen to 44?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their attention drawn by her statement, everyone else checked their bracelets, as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwo! I am only 19 points, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am 26.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have 15 points?\u201d</p><br/><p>George and the others unanimously informed each other of their points.</p><br/><p>Following Marsha, Mondo had the highest points.</p><br/><p>Hmm? Even if we did get points from our activities today, I thought it would have only been a few points\u2026.</p><br/><p>When I hurriedly checked my points as well, surprisingly enough, it was at 41.</p><br/><p>And when I checked how I got those points\u2014it was listed that I got about 33 points from monster subjugation and 8 from aid actions.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-672\"></span>Oi, oi, fish also count as monsters?!<span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-674\"></span></p><br/><p>And what\u2019s this 8 points for aiding actions? Because I made a fishing rod for each of them?</p><br/><p>Like 2 points for each? It\u2019s more of a shock that I only got 2 points for that painstaking work.</p><br/><p>But still, this is too unfair, this way of earning points\u2026 even I am astounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf cautious actions gave 2 points then\u2014we get one point for each fish we catch?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see! I also caught about 24, if I remember correct, so there\u2019s no mistaking it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put on airs just \u2018cause you won in fishing, Mondo. However, that settles it. I also remember catching 17 so each fish gives 1 point.\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard George and Mondo conversing.</p><br/><p>Oh, shoot.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>With this, scoring points becomes super easy.</p><br/><p>I started panicking inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, this is stupid. Earning points so easily, the person who set it up must be an idiot. Those Greed Circus guys are quite the foolish bunch, huh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? I also think so. I was thinking it would be quite hard~ But this makes it a piece of cake, right~?\u201d</p><br/><p>George said with a laugh and Aina also followed up with a nod.</p><br/><p>Their words hurt my ears.</p><br/><p>Why? \u2018Cause I was the one who set it up.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just a bit, no, actually, quite a bit embarrassing.</p><br/><p>I had set the 30 points to be the passing limit so Marsha has already passed.</p><br/><p>Mondo only needs 4 more points and even Aina who has the least points among them has earned about half the points needed.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;Fufufu, exactly as calculated, huh, Rimuru-sama?&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Ciel spoke to me happily while I was sulking.</p><br/><p>What are you talking about?\u2013when I asked her that, she replied with an atmosphere of \u2018I know what you are planning\u2019.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;After today\u2019s activities, Mondo, who is a dropout, will be viewed in a better light. And also Marsha, who has a talent for magic will be given a different role, right?&gt;&gt;</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\">Translations by AsianHobbyist Website</div><br/><p>Wh-what?!</p><br/><p>In other words, this grouping wasn\u2019t appropriate, as I thought. It seems they just grouped the problematic ones.</p><br/><p>Well, that is fine now but the problem is what Ciel just said.</p><br/><p>\u2014A different role for Marsha\u2026 you say?</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;You will feign ignorance, I see. What exactly are you planning, keeping it a secret from me, as well?&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Ciel answered, sounding like she was really enjoying herself.</p><br/><p>Hahaha, it seems she has misunderstood, thinking that this is something I schemed.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-12\"></div><br/><p>Needless to say, neither have I calculated for this to happen nor am I scheming anything.</p><br/><p>All of this is just Ciel\u2019s misunderstanding but\u2026 I guess I will use that for now.</p><br/><p>\u2014Fufu, as expected of Ciel. I can\u2019t hide things from you, can I? Mondo seemed like he lacked confidence so I just helped a bit, you see.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;As I thought. However, that was too lenient of you. To use your valuable trick which you were saving for something like this\u2013 &gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Ah, hmm.</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t a valuable trick I reserved or anything, you see.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s something even I didn\u2019t notice, you see.</p><br/><p>I mean, who would think that E rank giving 1 point would apply to fish as well, right?</p><br/><p>There are no fish inside the labyrinth, after all.</p><br/><p>And even if there were, they would be man-eating fish or demon fish living in the wetlands.</p><br/><p>Well, even I kept small insects like mosquito or fleas to be not applicable.</p><br/><p>Although the ones living in Apito\u2019s territory are different\u2026.</p><br/><p>It was a complete mistake on my part but as Ciel-san saw it as one of my strategies, my dignity has been upheld for now.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\">Translations by AsianHobbyist Website</div><br/><p>I did think of changing the bracelet\u2019s settings by using the master command but I stopped.</p><br/><p>If I did that, the points we got just now would look weird.</p><br/><p>Besides\u2014even regarding the fish strategy, since we caught this much today, surely the catch will be less tomorrow.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s something like a one-time bonus stage.</p><br/><p>Just like Ciel said, a trick of a sort.</p><br/><p>Even if the other students were to try and imitate, it wouldn\u2019t go as easily.</p><br/><p>In the first place, it\u2019s difficult making the fishing rod.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s probably not something they are taught in school and definitely not so simple that they can make it after seeing it once.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s surely no one who thought\u2014\u2019oh, something like this might happen so let me bring my fishing rod along\u2019.</p><br/><p>And, above all, the only reason we were able to have such a big catch was because I, being a gentleman as I am who likes fishing, went to all the trouble of making the fishing rod using Ciel-sensei\u2019s calculation abilities.</p><br/><p>It will probably be fine to not worry about that.</p><br/><p>And like that, with a total catch of 123 fish, we had made a triumphal return.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Those are Abyss Cores!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shouting out, he equipped his gun, and, destroyed one of the Abyss Cores using Dispel and Eraser bullets in rapid-fire.</p><br/><p>He would have shot down the remaining Cores too but,</p><br/><p>\u300cHello? Look, I\u2019m your opponent!\u300d</p><br/><p>Carrera stopped Kondo\u2019s barrage by herself shooting a full strength Energy Ball at him.</p><br/><p>Kondo drew back his gun, and attempted to repel the Energy Ball while dodging.</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of Energy that was as if a manifestation of Carrera\u2019s rage. But the real feat what that of Kondo\u2019s, who had repelled it all while remaining stoic of face.</p><br/><p>He was already analysing his opponent, planning to counter with a Dispel bullet, and if possible, Necrosis too.</p><br/><p>But, now he had no room to look after anyone else, and as if being completely isolated with Carrera, their single combat had began. (TN: I ship \u2018em already. :3 )</p><br/><p>Abyss Cores.</p><br/><p>These were lumps of mana which could be called the essential components of magic.</p><br/><p>Pumping them with ridiculous amounts of mana, a genuine death ray, the \u201cDeath Streak\u201d would be made.</p><br/><p>Releasing them as is would manifest \u201cNuclear Flame\u201d.</p><br/><p>And last but not least, the best usage was to use Mana Manipulation to alter the lumps into a compressed state.</p><br/><p>This would result in the strongest magic, \u201cGravity Collapse\u201d.</p><br/><p>It was the essence of Nuclear Magic.</p><br/><p>On a similar note, \u201cNuclear Cannon\u201d was made by exploding a few Abyss Core inside a tubular Magic Barrier, and pointing that energy in some arbitrary direction.</p><br/><p>It was easy to do, and was the easiest to control.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even at sizes as small as a fists, the Royal Knights clearly understood the power of a simple Abyss Core.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-impossible! How are there so many of these huge Abyss Cores!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf those things blew up, this whole place will be gone!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Mages\u2019 Barriers won\u2019t hold, all hands, eliminate those Cores!!\u300d</p><br/><p>And all of them made their moves.</p><br/><p>If left as is, and multiple \u201cNuclear Flames\u201d were blasted, their Emperor, should still be safe.</p><br/><p>But the majority of the Airships in the sky would undoubtedly be destroyed by the explosion.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, they couldn\u2019t allow such explosions near the Emperor even if he were to be safe.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat monstrosity!? To summon so many large Abyss Cores without any problem\u2026..\u300d</p><br/><p>That was the honest impression of the Royal Knights.</p><br/><p>The strongest among them had used their Holy Magic to counter balance, and successfully suppress the Abyss Cores.</p><br/><p>But 5 of them were still desperately trying to suppress the mana overflow.</p><br/><p>\u300cBzzt! Sorry, ti~me\u2019s up!!\u300d</p><br/><p>With an innocent delight.</p><br/><p>Came Ultima\u2019s sinister announcement.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, the Abyss Cores began their transformation.</p><br/><p>Squirming Tentacles of Black Fire coiled around the desperate 5 Royal Knights.</p><br/><p>This was the Magic Alteration ability of the Ultimate Skill attained by Ultima, \u300ePoison King Samael\u300f.</p><br/><p>The tentacles lined with poison would coil around and kill the target.</p><br/><p>Meaning that, as they couldn\u2019t eliminate the Abyss Cores with their Holy Magic, resistance was futile.</p><br/><p>As a result, they met no end other than death.</p><br/><p>The Squirming Tentacles of Black Fire gradually covered up its prey, and engulfed them.</p><br/><p>Fearing her end,</p><br/><p>\u300cH-help me, lieutenant Kondo!! \u300d</p><br/><p>Knight No. 6, Minaza, desperately seeked rescue from Kondo.</p><br/><p>However, Kondo didn\u2019t have that liberty.</p><br/><p>He had his hands full with Carrera, and simply couldn\u2019t spare the time to save his subordinates.</p><br/><p>So without even facing her,</p><br/><p>\u300cI, can\u2019t.\u300d</p><br/><p>He spoke pragmatically.</p><br/><p>\u300cN-no way a\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Before Minaza could even scream, it was over.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u201dLimit End\u201d! Ahahahaha!!</p><br/><p>Now, we can go one-on-one!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ultima playfully laughed.</p><br/><p>She held a Squirming Tentacle of Black Fire in her hand.</p><br/><p>Like a Black Flame Whip.</p><br/><p>And using that whip, she recovered the Energy from the Knights who just perished.</p><br/><p>\u300cPretty tasty. You\u2019re happy to be of some use aren\u2019t you?\u300d</p><br/><p>She said while slurping up those short-lived feelings of fear and hopelessness.</p><br/><p>While shuddering, Damrada analysed the current situation.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine that Kondo, their strongest, could have his hands full with a single Demon.</p><br/><p>No, he should have been able to imagine it.</p><br/><p>He knew about the peculiarity of Demon Lord Rimuru, so judging from the strength of Diablo who he had witnessed at the tournament, it wouldn\u2019t completely be out of the question.</p><br/><p>Except, that he had taken those factors into consideration and concluded that the Empire was stronger.</p><br/><p>At that time, he had believed that that was their full strength, and trusted that the status hadn\u2019t changed presently\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>That strength at the tournament was on par with the lower ranked Royal Knights.</p><br/><p>They were honestly impressive.</p><br/><p>However, they, the Knights, themselves possessed the Ultimate Gift \u300eAlternative\u300f.</p><br/><p>If one of the lower Knights weren\u2019t enough, they could team up.</p><br/><p>(Did they grow stronger\u2026\u2026? No\u2026\u2026 they weren\u2019t going all out at the tournament.)</p><br/><p>Thinking that the Knights No. 6 \u301c 10 would put up evenly with the ones called the Four Heavenly Kings was a complete mistake.</p><br/><p>And now.</p><br/><p>The cheerful female looking Demon in front of them seemed incomparably stronger than the Four Kings.</p><br/><p>Even Arch Demons would be a laughing stock.</p><br/><p>Surpassing even Demon Dukes, as if it was like a second coming of Guy \u30fb Crimson\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Minaza had screamed, and then disappeared.</p><br/><p>It was sad, but Damrada couldn\u2019t save her.</p><br/><p>Of course the reason\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Was that the girl named Ultima was clearly, he noticed, eyeing him. (TN: another ship!)</p><br/><p>The girl sneered,</p><br/><p>\u300cHeh, I guess this should be fun?\u300d</p><br/><p>Her sights set on the target, she began the assault.</p><br/><p>And while confronting her, Damrada realized another truth.</p><br/><p>(This Bitch\u2026\u2026 did she just kill of the weaker one\u2019s to even out the numbers\u2026\u2026?)</p><br/><p>Indeed.</p><br/><p>As of now, the numbers were so that every one of the Demon Dukes could have a go.</p><br/><p>You want to break our spirits with that power huh! Thought Damrada, forming his stance.</p><br/><p>Very well, we\u2019ll be bringing it.</p><br/><p>The power of the strongest knights, the Royal Knights.</p><br/><p>Ultima observed the Knights wearing a thin smile.</p><br/><p>She felt the depth of their strength.</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t be so sure of victory if she hadn\u2019t ascended.</p><br/><p>But, after attaining the Ultimate Skill \u300ePoison King Samael\u300f, losing didn\u2019t seem like a concept anymore.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>(Dammit, that Diablo. Making us train with these battles\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Underestimating much?</p><br/><p>If Testa realized this, she\u2019d be flipping out.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s a good chance\u2026\u2026 I guess it\u2019s fine to train the underlings.)</p><br/><p>She understood Diablo\u2019s intentions and decided to act accordingly.</p><br/><p>Out of the 10 Royal Knights at the start, only half remained.</p><br/><p>The Demons would all find a partner to test their mettle in battle.</p><br/><p>To become so strong after gaining control over her power, Ultima never thought it possible.</p><br/><p>She had hoped the Royal Knights would be stronger, but they almost weren\u2019t utilising the Ultimate Skill granted to them at all.</p><br/><p>Those weaklings couldn\u2019t even handle her simple Abyss Cores.</p><br/><p>They were individuals who had attained great Energy (life force), and wielded a shared Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>She had expected more of them to survive.</p><br/><p>She had playfully used her fire, aiming to kill at most a couple\u2026\u2026 but as a result, finished off half.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Demon Dukes, who didn\u2019t have Ultimate Skills, wouldn\u2019t have it so easy against the Royal Knights.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, their base stats being much higher, they shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble.</p><br/><p>Though, It\u2019d be bad if they did.</p><br/><p>If the underlings got killed, she wouldn\u2019t have the gall to face their lord, Rimuru-sama.</p><br/><p>But the experience gained from this fight would surely bolster their prospects.</p><br/><p>Just like Ultima, who had personally experienced Guy\u2019s might\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Only by tasting Guy\u2019s fearsome attack overlapped with Ultimate Skills did she truly desire one such Skill for herself.</p><br/><p>A simple attack.</p><br/><p>Her pre-ascended self couldn\u2019t even overcome such a playful, whimsical, non-serious magic.</p><br/><p>Humiliation.</p><br/><p>Bearing a title of high Nobility among the strongest of Demons, she couldn\u2019t even make use of her specialty of magic resistance.</p><br/><p>But, she also considered it good luck.</p><br/><p>She got to have such an experience only because she was Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s subordinate.</p><br/><p>Not just that, she was also blessed with ascension.</p><br/><p>Ultima felt that she couldn\u2019t even hope for more.</p><br/><p>Demons, as opposed to humans, were much higher beings.</p><br/><p>Just releasing their intense mana was enough to be considered an attack.</p><br/><p>As a result, perfecting their control raised them to even greater heights.</p><br/><p>Seeing the way her playful Abyss Cores dominated the Royal Knights, Ultima confirmed exactly where the difference in power lied.</p><br/><p>In the end, the base Spiritual (Holy) Power in humans wasn\u2019t much.</p><br/><p>In other words, they wouldn\u2019t be able to increase their base power no matter how perfect the control was.</p><br/><p>And then, I see, she thought.</p><br/><p>Why Diablo absolutely loathed relying on raw power.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s true that we Demons have high Energy potential. So we tend to rely on that power too much huh.)</p><br/><p>She acknowledged.</p><br/><p>Excluding Testarossa, Carrera and herself indeed indulged in that bad habit.</p><br/><p>She also knew that she was the most inexperienced among the three.</p><br/><p>Testarossa was elegant and flawless.</p><br/><p>She had the bad habit of looking down on others though.</p><br/><p>Carrera was haughty and aloof.</p><br/><p>She could do anything if she only tried, but always opted for lazier options.</p><br/><p>But herself\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Evermore inexperienced.</p><br/><p>She had neither Testarossa\u2019s precision, nor Carrera\u2019s abundance.</p><br/><p>She, Ultima, was the weakest of the 4 pillars of Devil Lords.</p><br/><p>Still\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(I want to be number 1!)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 Don\u2019t bask in the power you haven\u2019t attained yourself \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>She reminded herself of those words from Diablo.</p><br/><p>That was the reason why, except when in dire situations, Diablo never made use of the power granted to him by his Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she too.</p><br/><p>Using this opportunity, she would prove herself by mastering her own Ultimate Skill \u300ePoison King Samael\u300f.</p><br/><p>Ultima swore in her heart.</p><br/><p>Not the \u201cpower\u201d she had never wished for, but the \u201cSkill\u201d she earnestly desired; she would perfect it.</p><br/><p>And now.</p><br/><p>She was impressed with Damrada who, utilizing Holy Energy to his utmost, the man had overcome the force of her overwhelming attack.</p><br/><p>Ultima honestly found it interesting.</p><br/><p>Although it seemed like she was in control, she had been actually simply brute-forcing her way with immense mana.</p><br/><p>She already understood the fact, but now, had finally, truly recognized it.</p><br/><p>So, being able to enjoy her fight, both took their best stance, and initiated fierce combat.</p><br/><p>Carrera\u2019s knees hit the earth.</p><br/><p>The male human named Kondo was unbelievably strong.</p><br/><p>A true master.</p><br/><p>Carrera, boasting strength second only to Diablo among the 4 Devil Lords, couldn\u2019t but be amazed at the reality of the man before her.</p><br/><p>There was no anger.</p><br/><p>She knew that underestimating him would only leave her on the floor\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He was not easy prey.</p><br/><p>He would seal (curse) off her magic before it could be used.</p><br/><p>Reading the flow of mana required to activate the magic, he would precisely cut off the current.</p><br/><p>With the bizarre bullets from the gun in his hand.</p><br/><p>Unbeknownst to Carrera, this gun was a God-tier weapon.</p><br/><p>At the basest level, it was a gun shaped blunt weapon.</p><br/><p>It was cylindrical in shape, and could withstand intensive explosions.</p><br/><p>In short, there was no actual firing mechanism.</p><br/><p>Kondo would use his Skills to first create a mana explosion, and further, materialize and eject a bullet.</p><br/><p>That bullet was created by overlapping his Skills with the \u201cDivine Edge\u201d ability of Ultimate Skill \u300eSandalphon the Executioner\u300f.</p><br/><p>Kondo would mould the \u201cDivine Edge\u201d into the shape of a bullet, and then coat it with the effects of the Skill before firing.</p><br/><p>In a pinch, he could load the gun with a blade, but he had yet to be in such a situation.</p><br/><p>Finding the enemy\u2019s weakness, or flow of mana, and precisely striking them down.</p><br/><p>Just that.</p><br/><p>With unyielding fealty, Kondo had secured his position among the highest in the Empire.</p><br/><p>Carrera jittered in the humiliation called reality.</p><br/><p>The reality that, she couldn\u2019t win like this.</p><br/><p>With that mindset,</p><br/><p>\u300cFUCKING HUMA~N!!\u300d</p><br/><p>She cried, then hit her face with the back of her hand.</p><br/><p>Her face received Energy so massive, it was as if her head would blow right off.</p><br/><p>But that was fine.</p><br/><p>Enough looking down on the enemy.</p><br/><p>This was, she acknowledged, a suitable foe. She was no longer the aloof Carrera, but took on an earnestly serious attitude.</p><br/><p>After all, she was acting under Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s direct orders.</p><br/><p>Unlike the past, she could not allow herself to be selfish\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWas that too scary?</p><br/><p>My apologies, I needed to cool off a little.</p><br/><p>I was making light of you, or rather, humans in general, and ended up holding back you see.</p><br/><p>Who knew.</p><br/><p>Who could possibly know that I\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Would actually, truly, seriously face off against a human.\u300d</p><br/><p>And she gently rose.</p><br/><p>And at that, Kondo, for the first time, changed his expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, so you were hiding that much\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Very well.</p><br/><p>I too shall face you in earnest.\u300d</p><br/><p>After having spoken, for the first time, Kondo donned his \u201cArmour\u201d.</p><br/><p>Materialized though will power, it was his Former Imperial Army Official Uniform.</p><br/><p>It symbolized, for First Lieutenant Kondo, his battledress, and furthermore, this Uniform was a God-tiered armour.</p><br/><p>Carrera stood, and released her rich mana.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cLoyal Servant of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, I am Carrera, \u201cMenace Lord\u201d. In the name of the \u201cMenace Lord\u201d, I vow to kill you.\u300d</p><br/><p>She declared.</p><br/><p>\u300cFormer Imperial Army First Lieutenant, Kondo Tatsuya.</p><br/><p>Presently acting as leader of the Emperor\u2019s personal Knights.</p><br/><p>I shall rise to that challenge.\u300d</p><br/><p>Responded Kondo.</p><br/><p>The two sized each other up, and released their power.</p><br/><p>Carrera, at the precise moment, awakened to the power manifesting as a result of her determination \u2015\u2015 Ultimate Skill \u300eExtinction King Abaddon\u300f \u2015\u2015 and grasped for it.</p><br/><p>Until now, she had been fighting solely with her seemingly absolute demonic power.</p><br/><p>However, that was not enough.</p><br/><p>She would never reach the ones called Ultimates.</p><br/><p>Whether it be Diablo, or this Kondo fellow. To say nothing of Guy \u30fb Crimson, or the Demon Lord brass.</p><br/><p>It was not enough to only think of increasing her strength.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, just like her defeat against Guy\u2019s magic, she would end up only as fodder for the strong no matter how much she struggled.</p><br/><p>This, she would absolutely never allow.</p><br/><p>She had always felt a raging power inside her, but finally, she decided to appreciate it.</p><br/><p>She would not just control, but liberate it.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 Mine \u201cPower\u201d, I shall name thee. Becometh mine \u201cSkill (Abaddon)\u201d, and be liberated from thine shackles!!\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>And she attained it.</p><br/><p>Leaving nothing behind, the absolute \u201cPower\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 Ultimate Skill \u300eExtinction King Abaddon\u300f\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>This was the fearsome Skill, that, symbolizing Carrera\u2019s strength, would bring nothing but annihilation unto any hostiles.</p><br/><p>Meeting such a formidable foe sparked in her, for the first time, a deep desire for power.</p><br/><p>Facing Kondo, one she desired to kill more than Guy, Carrera focused.</p><br/><p>It was at that moment.</p><br/><p>An intense flash followed by an immense surge assaulted the Imperial Aerial Fighter Legion.</p><br/><p>Rimuru had fired his \u201cVeldora Sword\u201d.</p><br/><p>The Airships\u2019 crews were in a panic.</p><br/><p>The Emperor, who was, until now. under the safety of \u201cCastle Guard\u201d, and was focusing on controlling Veldora,</p><br/><p>\u300cNo way, why?</p><br/><p>Why, did the effect of my Regalia Dominion\u2026. my \u201cSovereign Rule\u201d disappear?</p><br/><p>Why, was Veldora defeated?!</p><br/><p>Impossible, that\u2019s just impossible!</p><br/><p>It was just a lowly Demon Lord, a puny slime!</p><br/><p>It should have become powerless, after the source of its powers, Veldora, was taken away\u2026.</p><br/><p>How, could it consume it\u2019s master, and take that power for itself!!</p><br/><p>I was this close to finally achieving victory against Guy!!</p><br/><p>To get in the way of my plans\u2026. Unforgivable, you lowly Demon Lord!!\u300d(TN: Spaghetti status: Re: DROPPED)</p><br/><p>Shouted out and stood up.</p><br/><p>The situation thus further intensified, and shifted into gear. (TN: code for cliff-hanger!!)</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Rant:</p><br/><p>So basically many have been asking for spoilers for the next few chapters ~ Gao\u2026 Honestly they don\u2019t really spoil very much. Basically fights, which are better read with the full descriptions anyway~~. Also. here on guro\u2019s site. there are all the chapter names to get a better idea of things (Spoiler warning). One can get a good feel for the material to come from this. Oh yea be sure to have that site bookmarked (in your browser and in your heart &lt;3) \u2018cos chapters from 186 onwards will be on there from october-ish. Better quality (and most likely slower :P). Well anyways. 180 should be out tomorrow. This is not a promise, so take it with a grain of salt. And as always, see you in another chapter ~~~~ Gao!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

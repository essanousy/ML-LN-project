Why would I be mean to Yoshida-jiisan?</p><br/><p>Clown: I wouldn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: I mean, he would play with you and me when I came over to hang out.</p><br/><p>Clown: Did you hang well?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Once on a tree, yes.</p><br/><p>Clown: With a rope?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Yes, why?</p><br/><p>Clown: And you didn\u2019t break your neck?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Why would you break your neck by hanging? We turned it into a swing\u2026 what a silly pun!</p><br/><p>Clown: Not as silly as a joke I know! A husband and wife are moving out of their house and are starting to box everything up. The husband finds a box under the bed, pulls it out, and looks inside, where he finds two eggs and about $8,000. He approaches the wife and asks, \u201cWhat are the eggs for?\u201d She replies, \u201cEvery time I cheat on you, I put an egg in the box.\u201d He says, \u201cThat\u2019s alright, you\u2019ve only cheated on me twice. What\u2019s the money for?\u201d The wife replies, \u201cEvery time I get a dozen, I sell them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pierrot: You do remember that my parents divorced, right?</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Life in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>063. Children and Spirits</p><br/><p>We moved to a different place.</p><br/><p>To the deepest room in the labyrinth\u2013the oracle room.</p><br/><p>Prior to arriving through to this room we first passed a large empty room before it.</p><br/><p>A path that is one meter wide and twenty meters long leads from this room to a five meter in diameter circular scaffold.</p><br/><p>What the scaffold is made of I do not know; it looks as if its spreading through the room.</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay? Step on top of that floor and call out to a spirit!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat should we say?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhatever you like, really. Help me! Or, Let\u2019s play!</p><br/><p>An interested spirit will definitely appear before you\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 will they really come?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey will! Sensei, they will, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWill they?\u300d</p><br/><p>The children look at me with a worried face.</p><br/><p>Well, I think it will be fine. If no spirits show, I\u2019ll make them appear.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026Hey, you! You\u2019re making a scary face!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? No problem, no problem.</p><br/><p>Hey, brats! Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll work out!\u300d</p><br/><p>If they don\u2019t show up, all I need to do is call them out myself.</p><br/><p>While I wouldn\u2019t mind spirits capable of thinking to appear\u2013we could talk to them in that case, I would prefer non-sentient ones.</p><br/><p>That is, in that case they could obey me without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I\u2019m coming along.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Well, I guess that\u2019s fine. Doesn\u2019t matter to me how many people go, but it is narrow. So, since you\u2019re coming, it\u2019s probably best to bring one child at a time.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmph. It\u2019s probably also a good idea to summon a spirit for each one of them.</p><br/><p>Why? There might be some grown-up negotiations involved.</p><br/><p>But anything goes as long as we can avoid negotiating with our fists\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright! One person at a time will go. Who\u2019s first?\u300d</p><br/><p>Then, we decided the order.</p><br/><p>First will be the eldest Gale.</p><br/><p>Then Alice.</p><br/><p>Followed by Kenya and Ryouta.</p><br/><p>And concluded with Chloe.</p><br/><p>They did quarrel about it, but in the end were satisfied with this order.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s get this over with.</p><br/><p>A tranquil room.</p><br/><p>Without a sound to be heard, enveloped by a dim light.</p><br/><p>Only our footsteps reverberated throughout it.</p><br/><p>\u300cSensei, if anything happens to me, please take care of them.\u300d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t be so formal.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s too tense. Without a word, I rub his head.</p><br/><p>We have reached the circular room.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s designed with an optical illusion that makes you feel as if you are falling.</p><br/><p>But,\u300eMagic Perception\u300fclearly sees a scaffold in there. Transparent glass? Acrylic fibers or something?</p><br/><p>I step onto it while a little surprised.</p><br/><p>But Gale is trembling in fear,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a platform here. If anything happens, I\u2019ll save you.\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, having long resolved myself.</p><br/><p>Timidly and carefully,</p><br/><p>He proceeds into the center</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, there\u2019s fine! I\u2019m looking forward to the phrase you choose!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris told him.</p><br/><p>And after she tapped his head, he closed his eyes and began to pray.</p><br/><p>Kneeling, as if praying to the gods.</p><br/><p>I crossed my arms while observing this.</p><br/><p>After some time has passed, drops of light began to fall from the sky.</p><br/><p>Like snow.</p><br/><p>And, before us on the altar a single person\u2026 no, a single spirit appeared.</p><br/><p>Gale noticed this and continued to pray.</p><br/><p>Good job! It\u2019s a success.</p><br/><p>A non-sentient mass of natural energy. Appearing like a mass of magical energy, but a mere counterfeit.</p><br/><p>Will it be able to acquire an ego? Like Veldora\u2019s cave, this place is filled with natural energy.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s not self-aware it will probably disperse, then come together again to give birth to a new spirit.</p><br/><p>Then, without any hesitation, I ate the spirit.</p><br/><p>\u300cGale, continue praying!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWh-what was that! You\u2026 what have you done?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRamiris, shut up for a second. I\u2019ve got a plan.\u300d</p><br/><p>Calmly, I call forth\u300eGreat Sage\u300f</p><br/><p>After reading my intentions, it began the calculation. And after completing them, it began transforming the spirit.</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. Transformation of the spirit using\u300eGreat Sage\u300fhas been completed.</p><br/><p>The contents are now mostly of\u300eEarth Attribute Abilities\u300f</p><br/><p>Furthermore, after analyzing flame giant Ifrit, a pseudo-human personality has been created.</p><br/><p>Corrective ability from the unique skill\u300eGreat Sage\u300fhas been added.</p><br/><p>Will you bestow this power on Gale Gibson? [YES]/[NO]\u226b</p><br/><p>I place my hand on Gale\u2019s head, select YES, and grant him the power.</p><br/><p>Through this, the contract with the spirit will be completed within a single moment.</p><br/><p>After analyzing Gale\u2019s condition I confirmed that the rampaging magical energy was now at peace.</p><br/><p>Of course, his aggregate energy is still far higher than that of normal children.</p><br/><p>That is the result of spiritual energy and magical energy offsetting each other. Now, as he continues to grow he will probably be able to acquire many abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurgery was successful!\u201d I thought in my mind, and shook hands with the\u300eGreat Sage\u300f- mentally, of course.</p><br/><p>I mean, I haven\u2019t ever seen what it looks like and have no idea if it even has a form.</p><br/><p>\u300cYup, all done! Good job!\u300d</p><br/><p>I say to Gale.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t look like he was in pain or anything; he just quickly looked up at me.</p><br/><p>I gave a big nod.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re okay now. The collapse has stopped, I guarantee it!\u300d</p><br/><p>With a face full of tears,</p><br/><p>\u300cSensei, thank you very much!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He bowed.</p><br/><p>While hiding my embarrassment I patted his head, and so we rejoined the other kids.</p><br/><p>Everyone was very happy to find out that we had succeeded. But, we have just begun.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s meaningless unless everyone is saved.</p><br/><p>\u300cSteel yourselves. We\u2019ll celebrate when everyone is saved!\u300d</p><br/><p>They were reminded by my words and nodded.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s move on to the second one.</p><br/><p>Next was Alice.</p><br/><p>She said that she was scared walking down the path, so I carried her instead.</p><br/><p>Chloe and Alice seemed to bickering about something before, but it\u2019s probably just children\u2019s dispute.</p><br/><p>Without a care in the world, I picked Alice up and proceeded towards the room.</p><br/><p>I hope things go just as good this time.</p><br/><p>Under my watchful eye, Alice bowed down to pray. Holding her hands together tightly, holding onto her skirt.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a while, light began to fall from the sky just as before.</p><br/><p>The moment the spirit appeared on the Altar, I ate it.</p><br/><p>Ramiris looked as if she had something to say, but I completely ignored her.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve gotten used to this the second time around.</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. Transformation of the spirit using\u300eGreat Sage\u300fhas been completed.</p><br/><p>The contents are now mostly of\u300eSky Attribute Abilities\u300f</p><br/><p>Furthermore, after analyzing flame giant Ifrit, a pseudo-human personality has been created.</p><br/><p>Corrective ability from the unique skill\u300eGreat Sage\u300fhas been added.</p><br/><p>Due to excellent affinity, it has fused with\u300eShadow Step\u300fand evolved into\u300eSpatial Transfer\u300f.</p><br/><p>Will you bestow this power on Alice Rondo? [YES]/[NO] \u226b</p><br/><p>Seems like my ability has evolved after coming in contact with a spirit.</p><br/><p>What an unexpected occurrence.</p><br/><p>I granted the ability to Alice.</p><br/><p>Oh by the way,\u300eBarrier\u300fhas changed into Spacial Barrier, but I cannot give it to Alice. I wonder if her affinity with it is just bad or something?</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s a skill she can just acquire on her own someday.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlice, well done! You\u2019re fine now!\u300d</p><br/><p>I held her up in my arms and said.</p><br/><p>She smiled widely and kissed me on the cheek.</p><br/><p>Oi oi, what a precocious child. I mean, should I even be happy to be popular with seven year olds?</p><br/><p>Nah, I\u2019m happy.</p><br/><p>Just remember\u2013I\u2019m a gentleman, not some perverted lolicon.</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks!\u300d</p><br/><p>She bowed in thanks, and we returned to the rest of the group.</p><br/><p>The moment I put her down she began to quarrel with the furious Chloe, but I guess that just shows how close they are.</p><br/><p>I returned to the circular room with Kenya.</p><br/><p>Now I feel confident. Things are going smoothly.</p><br/><p>Just three left. In worst case scenario, I had planned to summon the spirits myself and grant them to children, but there was no need for that.</p><br/><p>But, I am glad there\u2019s only three left. Transforming the spirits takes up a surprising amount of energy.</p><br/><p>I should be able to manage three more.</p><br/><p>The moment Kenya started praying \u2013 I mean, he hasn\u2019t even closed his eyes yet \u2013 light began falling from the sky.</p><br/><p>What? That\u2019s a mass of energy far larger than the ones that appeared for the other two.</p><br/><p>And there stood a human shaped spirit\u2013a boy.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! How\u2019s life? I\u2019m good.</p><br/><p>I felt like coming over, so I did!\u300d</p><br/><p>And extended a casual greeting.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, ahhhhh!!! You, why did you just come to someone\u2019s house uninvited!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris, her eyes wide, asked that of the child spirit.</p><br/><p>Seems like they know each other.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, who\u2019s that?\u300d</p><br/><p>To my question, without waiting for Ramiris\u2019 introduction,</p><br/><p>\u300cO~su! I am the spirit of light!</p><br/><p>Unlike that depressing and fallen descendant of darkness spirit, I am a pure spirit!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said.</p><br/><p>After thus introducing ourselves we continued the discussion.</p><br/><p>Kenya, in a panic, was staring at us. Stop it, already.</p><br/><p>After listening to our story, and perhaps maybe because Kenya had a good disposition towards light\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, I decided to help Kenya!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is how it happened.</p><br/><p>Generally, light and darkness spirits have the highest social standing, and are the highest grade of spirits.</p><br/><p>Seems like he\u2019s also capable of bestowing divine protection onto heroes. In the first place, Ramiris and him are supposed to do that together, but that rarely happens.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe last time we blessed a hero together was\u2026 what? Two thousand years ago?\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what he said.</p><br/><p>After Ramiris got really bored and decided to become an evil spirit, bestowing divine protection became his job.</p><br/><p>A pointless discussion, but it seems that Ramiris has inherited her \u201cself\u201d from previous generations.</p><br/><p>She used to reign as the queen of fairies, but after reaching the pinnacle of power beyond which she could not progress she decided to split herself.</p><br/><p>And to each one of these clone-children she gave a sense of self.</p><br/><p>Thus, when they would grow up they could perhaps surpass the original. The flaw being\u2013their weakness during childhood.</p><br/><p>A race that continuously strove to grow out of weakness.</p><br/><p>Among all the demon lords, only she possesses such hereditary abilities.</p><br/><p>Random outbursts of anger are expected from the selfish Ramiris, but their relationship can be described in only one word\u2013terrible.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t it seem like most of demon lords are selfish? Can\u2019t say that all of them are like that, but so far\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, until Ken-chan grows up, I\u2019ll be protecting you.</p><br/><p>Maybe, Ken-chan, you can even become a hero!\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying so, and without waiting for permission, he entered Kenya.</p><br/><p>Much too quickly Kenya\u2019s body completely stabilized.</p><br/><p>\u300cSensei\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? It\u2019s okay. All according to plan!\u300d</p><br/><p>Whose plan! I retort to myself; just remember, me: if you let it get to you, you lose.</p><br/><p>Things are going smoothly.</p><br/><p>Though Kenya seemed to doubt my words he did believe the fact that his condition stabilized.</p><br/><p>After returning to the rest of the group he explained the situation himself.</p><br/><p>Somehow, he seems to have matured a bit.</p><br/><p>Next would be Ryouta.</p><br/><p>What spirit would the weak willed Ryouta summon? It\u2019d be bad if he doesn\u2019t appear, I worry.</p><br/><p>Just as previously, he bowed to pray before the altar.</p><br/><p>He walked down the narrow path by himself. Seemed spirited enough.</p><br/><p>Now, what will happen?</p><br/><p>Immediately, an emerald light fell from the sky drawing thousands of helices.</p><br/><p>Before anything strange could happen, I ate it.</p><br/><p>According to the analysis it\u2019s water and wind. A two-element spirit! You\u2019ve done well, Ryouta.</p><br/><p>The rest is up to\u300eGreat Sage\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. Transformation of the spirit using\u300eGreat Sage\u300fhas been completed.</p><br/><p>The contents are now mostly of\u300eHeat Manipulation Ability\u300fand\u300eTransformation Ability\u300f</p><br/><p>Furthermore, after analyzing flame giant Ifrit, a pseudo-human personality has been created.</p><br/><p>Corrective ability from the unique skill\u300eGreat Sage\u300fhas been added.</p><br/><p>Due to excellent affinity, it has fused with\u300eCloning\u300f.</p><br/><p>Attempted to evolve into\u300eQuantum Manipulation\u300f. Failed.</p><br/><p>Will you bestow this power on Sekiguchi Ryouta? [YES]/[NO] \u226b</p><br/><p>Cloning is something that is very difficult to use without\u300eGreat Sage\u300fsupport.</p><br/><p>So even if I grant it to him he probably won\u2019t be able to use it. Well, whatever.</p><br/><p>On that note,\u300eQuantum Manipulation\u300fhuh? I have no idea what such a skill could do.</p><br/><p>In the first place, can it teach me the basic concepts of the skill? I\u2019d be happy if it could! If I investigated its concepts I might be able to replicate its effects.</p><br/><p>Unlike the system of this world that people ardently study\u2013magic, my abilities are far more unreasonable.</p><br/><p>That is, if I explain the concept behind a skill in depth to the\u300eGreat Sage\u300fit could create a system to make it usable; well, what\u2019s impossible is impossible, however.</p><br/><p>Perhaps that\u2019s why the evolution had failed.</p><br/><p>In any case, I was able to successfully bestow the spirit onto Ryouta.</p><br/><p>And so, only one person left.</p><br/><p>The last person, Chloe was very afraid to walk there, so I carried her over.</p><br/><p>She was very happy.</p><br/><p>Seems like she lied about her fear.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, sensei,.. I\u2026 I l-love you!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Red to her ears she so told me.</p><br/><p>I also like her. If she chooses, of course, to say the same after eight\u2026 no ten years.</p><br/><p>I wish I had such a problem in my past life\u2026</p><br/><p>A pitiful existence, not a day together with a girlfriend, a pitiful man.</p><br/><p>However, as a result I was able to acquire the wonderful\u300eGreat Sage\u300fskill. So it\u2019s a fair trade\u2026 probably not.</p><br/><p>But how nice. Children are so honest.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s something they can only do when they are in school.</p><br/><p>Well, past middle school they are often too embarrassed to say anything though.</p><br/><p>But it was never too late for me. I mean, if something never even started, it can\u2019t be too late.</p><br/><p>But let\u2019s forget about me for a second. Unfortunately, I became a little flustered upon hearing her words.</p><br/><p>Now, what kind of spirit will she summon.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s the last one. Not a time for failure.</p><br/><p>Like everyone else, she bowed to pray.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s when things started to change.</p><br/><p>Should I call it that\u2026? For example, something did fall from the sky.</p><br/><p>An oppressive aura, and a beautiful girl with silver-black hair.</p><br/><p>It had the vitality unbefitting a spirit.</p><br/><p>Is she some astral existence? Abandoned her flesh and lives as a mass of energy.</p><br/><p>Rather than a spirit, she radiates some form of soul energy. At this rate, she will dissipate.</p><br/><p>To prevent her dissipation, she either needs something to bind her soul, or to reincarnate into some body.</p><br/><p>Without a body, we\u2019d need to create some system for keeping her here.</p><br/><p>Which isn\u2019t simple even for a high level spirit\u2026</p><br/><p>That girl (?)\u2026 celestial maiden suddenly saw me and grabbed on to me. And locked her lips around mine.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, as a ghost, she has no texture. A real shame.</p><br/><p>Such a beautiful girl, even if she was a ghost\u2026 I would never! I mean, what\u2019s going on?!</p><br/><p>The celestial maiden, with a look full of disappointment, moved to touch Chloe.</p><br/><p>\u300cStop!!! I won\u2019t let you! I won\u2019t let you do as you please!\u300d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ramiris held up both of her hands, prepared for combat.</p><br/><p>Unlike her usual frivolous appearance, her eyes were completely serious thsi time.</p><br/><p>A black light covered her hands which she shot out at Chloe. I jumped in front of Chloe to protect her, and it absorbed into my body.</p><br/><p>\u3008Annihilation\u3009magic of instant death\u2026 It\u2019s hard to believe, but she seriously intended to kill her.</p><br/><p>\u300cH-hey! What was that for!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up!!! She\u2019s dangerous! Don\u2019t you see?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t?! What\u2019s dangerous?\u300d</p><br/><p>While we were busy arguing, the celestial maiden overlapped with Chloe and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Quickly, I verify Chloe\u2019s status. The collapse has stopped.</p><br/><p>No problem, right\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u300cOoooo! Mou! Too late. I give up\u2026 I don\u2019t even care anymore!\u300d</p><br/><p>Puffing her cheeks, Ramiris shouted.</p><br/><p>No idea what just happened.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking\u2026 what was that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris did not respond to my question.</p><br/><p>Chloe opened her eyes and appeared completely oblivious to our worries.</p><br/><p>When I asked her again,</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know! I have absolutely no idea,</p><br/><p>But, that was probably something born in the future.</p><br/><p>Something that came from the future, and not a spirit.</p><br/><p>Did she possess that girl to give birth to herself?</p><br/><p>Ahh\u2026.. I don\u2019t know!!!</p><br/><p>But, that was something truly powerful.</p><br/><p>If that is born in the future, it\u2019ll cause many problems.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen such a being. That\u2026 maybe that was the spirit of time\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmph.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at me. I gave up trying to understand.</p><br/><p>Well, whatever. Chloe is perfectly fine.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s pointless to consider the future we have no control over right now.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood for you, Chloe! You too were able to avoid danger!\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, lifting her up in the air.</p><br/><p>Chloe smiled happily.</p><br/><p>Ramiris, looking at us, could only sigh.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I guess it\u2019s fine. There was nothing more I could do since the moment it possessed the girl\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She said, and turned away from us.</p><br/><p>\u300cI think everything will be fine. Chloe is fine and all.</p><br/><p>By the way, thanks. Thanks to you, the children are safe!\u300d</p><br/><p>When we returned to the group I thanked Ramiris.</p><br/><p>The children showered her in thanks.</p><br/><p>\u300cBa! That\u2019s enough, already!\u300d</p><br/><p>Her face red, she tried to shake off the embarrassment.</p><br/><p>This is a demon lord\u2026 what\u2019s the world coming to?</p><br/><p>The other fairies flew next to Ramiris creating a beautiful sight.</p><br/><p>In order to bless the children who avoided that dreaded fate\u2026</p><br/><p>To light the fire of happiness in their hearts.</p><br/><p>And naturally, a smile formed on the kids\u2019 faces.</p><br/><p>And so, I was able to save the kids.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

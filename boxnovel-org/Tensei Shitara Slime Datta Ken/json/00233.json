Dino did everything he could for destruction.</p><br/><p>Without being sensed by Demon Lord Guy Crimson, Dino swiftly exacted his vengeance.</p><br/><p>However, that never made Dino feel better.</p><br/><p>He thought about destroying the world itself, but remembering Milim, the orphaned child of Veldanava and Lucia, calmed his raging heart.</p><br/><p>Then several thousand years passed.</p><br/><p>While losing his reason to live, Dino continued his duty as the guardian of the surface world.</p><br/><p>Although he himself lived lazily and only heard reports from his two subordinates.</p><br/><p>The reason why he became a Demon Lord was to gain information.</p><br/><p>Protecting the being called Milim from the shadow became Dino\u2019s reason to live.</p><br/><p>Although he never came into contact with her directly, and neither had he planned to acknowledge Milim as his master\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When Dino saw the scum Clayman hit Millim, something changed inside him.</p><br/><p>Unique Skill\u300eSloth\u300fthat he had acquired unknowingly had evolved into Ultimate Skill\u300eSlothful Lord Belphegor\u300f.</p><br/><p>Unique Skill\u300eSloth\u300f, which Dino acquired while continuing his slothful lifestyle, had the ability to deprave the targets.</p><br/><p>Because he ended up obtaining the skill, Dino thought about using it.</p><br/><p>To kill time and partially to tease Dagruel, Dino played around and tried to deprave him with his Unique Skill\u300eSloth\u300f.</p><br/><p>Like Dino, Dagruel, who had dedicated his loyalty to the same deceased master, was pitiful. That was also the reason why Dino tried to untie Dagruel\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>It was a completely unintended event for Dino that the ability he used for such purpose evolved into an ultimate ability.</p><br/><p>However, even so. Dino\u2019s fate was changed because the acquisition of this ability.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Was it a coincidence, or perhaps, was it fate?\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Those with angel series\u2019 ability couldn\u2019t resist the Master Program (Ruler of the Angel), the hidden ability of Ultimate Skill\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300f.</p><br/><p>The only possible way to resist it was to offset an angel series\u2019 ability with a demon series\u2019 ability.</p><br/><p>Although it had transformed.\u300eFallen Lord Luciel\u300fwas still a part of angel series\u2019 ability, it couldn\u2019t escape from Absolute Control of\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300f.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment. Here, inside the labyrinth created by Ramiris.</p><br/><p>When Ultimate Skill\u300eFallen Lord Luciel\u300f, which he had sealed for a long time, was activated, Dino realized.</p><br/><p> (Ahh, I see. Angel series\u2019 ability facilitated the Thought Guidance as a marker\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>Whereas the demon series were free abilities, angel series were hierarchical abilities. They were programmed to obey the order of the Supreme Being.</p><br/><p>Dino, who had his resistance increased due to becoming a fallen angel from the start, and because he was isolated in this subspace, was now released from the Curse of Control. Once he escaped, he wouldn\u2019t get caught for a second time.</p><br/><p>Dino's\u300eSlothful Lord Belphegor\u300foffset\u300eFallen Lord Luciel\u300fand he regained full control of himself.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Dino passed through the hole on the labyrinth\u2019s outer wall and jumped into the subspace.</p><br/><p>When he did so, he suddenly sensed the traces of the thought interference wave from\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300fagainst\u300eFallen Lord Luciel\u300fand completed the countermeasures with\u300eSlothful Lord Belphegor\u300f.</p><br/><p>Although Dino was may have been a bum, he worked fast. It wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t work, he just didn\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>That was how the man named Dino was; he would do things swiftly as possible if he was forced to do so.</p><br/><p>It was needless to say, the best thing for him was\u300eNot working\u300f.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for Dino, however, a future of hard work awaited him.</p><br/><p>\u300eGood job! Now, you have one job left!\u300f</p><br/><p>Ramiris\u2019 thoughts reached him even though he was separated from Zegion.</p><br/><p>In short, he had completely succeeded in escaping from the inside of Zero\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>It seemed that two other people had stood waiting, Zegion promptly headed to his designated position.</p><br/><p>Dino felt from their presence that those two\u2019s energy level\u2019s easily surpassed those of awakened demon lord class.</p><br/><p>With Zegion included, the three people arranged themselves like an equilateral triangle.</p><br/><p>(Diablo and Benimaru, is it.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Did their energy increase again?)</p><br/><p>Dino thought so, although he wasn\u2019t eager to throw out a tsukkomi.</p><br/><p>Dino quickly understood the aim of the plan and his role in it.</p><br/><p>They were trying to annihilate Zero with the ones who had the strongest fighting power.</p><br/><p>Dino had thought that it would be impossible to annihilate Zero seriously since destroying a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d wasn\u2019t easy at all\u2026... but he realized that they were actually serious about it.</p><br/><p>Dino also moved inside the subspace so that the lengths of the sides became equal and reached his designated position.</p><br/><p>It was a ritual requiring no less than 4 people.</p><br/><p>With two people, it formed a one-dimensional line of two dots connected.</p><br/><p>With three people, it formed a two-dimensional triangle.</p><br/><p>If it was with four people, it formed a three-dimensional tetrahedron.</p><br/><p>In other words, they were forming a Spatial Magic Circle which far surpassed the level of the multi-layered magic circle\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>And so, a tetrahedron was formed as to enclose the \u201dBerserk Evil Dragon\u201d Zero.</p><br/><p>With each person as a vertex, Zero was caught inside\u300eAbsolute Barrier[3]\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu, as expected of Demon Lord Dino-sama. It helps that you\u2019re exceptionally observant.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAhh, that\u2019s creepy. Don\u2019t need to use honorifics with me, Diablo.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? There isn\u2019t shred of respect inside my heart, you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re fucking kidding right! That\u2019s so uncalled for!? So you aren\u2019t just being sarcastic\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat thing aside. Shouldn\u2019t we end this quickly?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. Leave the nonsense for later.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, why is it my fault?\u201d Dino held back from saying those words.</p><br/><p>It was pointless even if he said it; it could be worse as it might unnecessarily provoke Zegion\u2019s anger.</p><br/><p>The notion that Zegion would be someone hard to deal with had already taken root inside Dino\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, Dino-dono. The main act is yours. We will match our timing with yours.\u300d</p><br/><p>So Diablo said.</p><br/><p>Benimaru and Zegion didn\u2019t have objection either.</p><br/><p>If it was just the three of them, it was possible for them to match their timing perfectly, but to request something like that from Dino would be harsh.</p><br/><p>So, at the same time that Dino unleashed his technique, the three of them would follow it.</p><br/><p>Dino had no complaints either.</p><br/><p>Rather, he felt relieved that he wasn\u2019t asked to do something unreasonable, such as matching his timing with theirs.</p><br/><p>\u300cGotcha. Let\u2019s go with full power!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino yelled, sharpened his spirit and focused his mind in order to unleash his strongest attack.</p><br/><p>His six pairs of white and black wings shone, as he gathered the surroundings\u2019 magic essence and spirits into his twin swords \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cFallen Crusade[4]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>And so, he fired a white light slash and black shadow slash.</p><br/><p>Both of the slashes intersected spectacularly at the center of the tetrahedron.</p><br/><p>Colorless aurora filled the inside of\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300f.</p><br/><p>However, the attacks on the \u201cBerserk Evil Dragon\u201d Zero weren\u2019t over yet.</p><br/><p>The moment both slashes intersected\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cEnd of World!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDimension Storm!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cProminence Acceleration!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Several super special moves were unleashed.</p><br/><p>With exquisite timing, it all reached the center of the tetrahedron as to cover Dino\u2019s technique.</p><br/><p>It caused a catastrophic, destructive power which was the greatest ever seen since the beginning of the universe.</p><br/><p>The catastrophic destruction filled\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300f, which was created to not let such power escape.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Quartet Skill[5]\uff1aBreakdown Nostalgia[6]\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>The power of the four people combined as one and brought forth the ultimate destruction.</p><br/><p>It could be said that it was fortunate that this place was a subspace.</p><br/><p>For example, even if it was sealed by\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300f, just the leaked aftershock of the destructive power would be enough to wreck the surface ground.</p><br/><p>Since it was a Quartet Skill by four of the most powerful beings in the world, the synergy produced an unimaginable result.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>You are reading this in Guro\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>Everyone who witnessed the spectacle was completely silenced.</p><br/><p>Except for one person.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufu, kuha, kuhahahahaha! Amazing, what a truly amazing power!!</p><br/><p>However, what is more amazing than all else is the existence called \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>Even after being bathed by such destructive power, it hasn\u2019t been annihilated\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>While Diablo laughed loudly, he analyzed it calmly.</p><br/><p>Exactly as he stated, only the intact \u201cDragon Core\u201d remained in the center of the tetrahedron.</p><br/><p>Although colorless, it was a mysterious orb emitting a dim shine.</p><br/><p>Everyone was captivated as if their minds were stolen by the orb.</p><br/><p>However, that would lead to carelessness.</p><br/><p>The \u201cBerserk Dragon\u201d Zero, without thinking about his own destruction, tried to take, at the very least, one of them along with him as his last breath\u2019s struggle.</p><br/><p>He predicted that if one corner of the tetrahedron was destroyed, the power trapped inside\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300fwould swallow everyone in this place.</p><br/><p>Zero\u2019s instinct couldn\u2019t understand it, but if he succeeded, it would deal a massive amount of damage to the main body of Ramiris\u2019 labyrinth.</p><br/><p>As his malevolent instinct demanded, Zero mustered the last bit of his power to stretch out his tentacle.</p><br/><p>That tentacle went towards Dino\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>The first one to react was Garasha, she pulled Pico and threw her towards Dino.</p><br/><p>She protected Pico from the tentacle with her own body, but that was her limit.</p><br/><p>When the tentacle grasped Garasha, it dragged her into\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300f.</p><br/><p>From inside Pico\u2019s arm who had lost her balance, Gaia jumped to Garasha while it cried\u300cKyui~~!!\u300d.</p><br/><p>Everything happened instantaneously.</p><br/><p>\u300cGarasha!\u300d</p><br/><p>Although Dino shouted, he couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Because he understood that if he moved now,\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300f would collapse.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStop! You\u2019ll disappear if you enter it\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino stopped Pico, who was about to jump in.</p><br/><p>Needless to say, the power inside wasn\u2019t something she could endure.</p><br/><p>Even if he did that, Dino knew that he would end up losing Pico as well.</p><br/><p>(Damn it! If only I didn\u2019t let my guard down\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Dino lamented, but he couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>He had no other choice but to give up.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, then, Garasha\u2026\u2026and also Gaia will\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Pico appealed to Dino while thinking about her companion.</p><br/><p>But, Pico understood it too.</p><br/><p>There was nothing she could do.</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t, I don\u2019t like things like this\u2026\u2026 Dino\u2015\u2015!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Just one.</p><br/><p>If there was just one possibility\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cListen, I will give you my strength. I\u2019ll give you all of my power, so please maintain\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300fwith it. Garasha won\u2019t last long if she gets dragged into the center.</p><br/><p>So, rest assured. I\u2019ll go and save her quickly!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, that\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBelieve me. I\u2019ll do it right away as there\u2019s no time.\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino started to take preemptive action.</p><br/><p>Although the tentacle itself had already disappeared, it would be impossible for Garasha to get back to Dino\u2019s with her own strength.</p><br/><p>In any case, the destructive power produced by the Quartet Skill would be blocked by\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300f and would converge in the center.</p><br/><p>It would create a powerful gravitational force towards the center, and consigned everything into oblivion beyond the \u201cEvent Horizon[7]\u201d.</p><br/><p>In order to escape from there you would need to exceed the speed of light, which was practically impossible.</p><br/><p>The space was too distorted and unstable, so activating\u300eTransfer\u300fwas out of the question.</p><br/><p>There was no more time to spare.</p><br/><p>The burden on Garasha would increase exponentially the closer she got to the center.</p><br/><p>Because Garasha was an awakened demon lord class who specialized in defense, she could only manage to maintain her barrier somehow.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, brace yourself. The energy transfers will begin\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u300d</p><br/><p>At the moment when Dino tried to transfer his power to Pico, a voice could be heard from Dino\u2019s pocket.</p><br/><p>And then the small, round orb shone brightly.</p><br/><p>It was the pseudo core Rimuru used to play with, which Dino got from Zegion before the plan started.</p><br/><p>As the orb floated and drifted in the subspace, it shone intensely just for a moment.</p><br/><p>And then, a feminine figure manifested from it.</p><br/><p>That person suddenly appeared in front of Dino with his bluish-silver hair fluttering.</p><br/><p>And then that person tapped Dino\u2019s shoulder lightly, while jovially said\u300cWell then, I\u2019m going out for a bit.\u300d, and flew into\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300fwhere a storm of power raging inside.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Garasha saw her life flash before her eyes like a revolving lantern[8].</p><br/><p>She had gotten caught by the tentacle while trying to save Pico.</p><br/><p>At that point, she had given up on her life.</p><br/><p>Because she couldn\u2019t believe that a fallen angel like her, nonetheless an awakened demon lord class, would be able to withstand the vortex of ultra-high density destructive energy that could even destroy a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>As she approached the center, the burden on Garasha\u2019s body increased.</p><br/><p>Even so, she still could hold on herself, thanks to Gaia, the small dragon inside her embrace.</p><br/><p>Gaia had a hard time assisting Garasha\u2019s defense barrier, they barely succeeded in neutralizing the destructive power.</p><br/><p>But, it was only a matter of time.</p><br/><p>A Quartet Skill of four of the most powerful beings in this world.</p><br/><p>It produced an unimaginable destructive power which this world had never experienced before.</p><br/><p>Garasha\u2019s senses couldn\u2019t understand the extent of its greatness.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re a fool, aren\u2019t you? There was no need for you to follow me\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It's a pity, but I can\u2019t help you anymore\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKyui?\u300d</p><br/><p>Garasha muttered so and gently patted Gaia who was in her embrace.</p><br/><p>And then, she resigned herself to fate and calmly waited for her impending doom\u2026...</p><br/><p>But, that time never came.</p><br/><p>The reason why was\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>That was a close call.</p><br/><p>If Ciel was just a little bit late in creating a new ability, we would have lost Gaia.</p><br/><p>If that happened, I can't even imagine how angry Milim would be...</p><br/><p>I get the shivers just by thinking about it.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, Dino tried to jump in to help them; there\u2019s a better place for such recklessness.</p><br/><p>Even if there were 2 people of awakened demon lord class, I wasn't sure they can reach the speed of light.</p><br/><p>It was a black hole. Not even light could escape, so even if they reached 99% the speed of light, it would still be meaningless.</p><br/><p>They might be able to escape if they haven\u2019t reached the core yet, but it will be a very risky gamble. It isn\u2019t something you can do it somehow just with willpower.</p><br/><p>So, how could I do it?</p><br/><p>Naturally, I wouldn't do something like moving beyond the speed of light.</p><br/><p>And yet, there was a simple reason why I could say that I ended up fine.</p><br/><p>If you can stop time, you don\u2019t have to think about speed.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the freedom to move beyond the speed of light.</p><br/><p>But, I didn't need to do that this time.</p><br/><p>Because I can neutralize it to a certain degree with\u300eNihility Barrier[9]\u300fof my\u300eNihility Collapse\u300f.</p><br/><p>Things that come into contact with the barrier are assimilated and converted into nihility energy.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the characteristic of\u300eNihility Barrier\u300f.</p><br/><p>Instead of escaping, endure it till the end. This may be the only way.</p><br/><p>Well, even if it fails by any chance, I will be absolutely safe.</p><br/><p>After all, it\u2019s because the new ability Ciel had created, \u300eMultiple Existence\u300fwas incorporated into Ultimate Skill\u300eVoid God Azathoth\u300f.</p><br/><p>It was an ability Ciel made after she finished analyzing Ultimate Skill\u300eEvil Dragon Azi Dahaka\u300f, I could create clones which all connected with this ability.</p><br/><p>Thanks to this ability, I didn\u2019t need to be cautious of Velda anymore.</p><br/><p>Thus I revealed myself, but I think that it was still impossible, even for Velda, to sense me in this subspace.</p><br/><p>Still, I shouldn't carelessly rule out the worst case scenario.</p><br/><p>However, there\u2019s no problem for now.</p><br/><p>Even if he sensed me and isolated Ramiris\u2019 labyrinth, my clone which can also called as my main body still exists in the Imaginary Space.</p><br/><p>If Velda did isolate the labyrinth, there\u2019s a possibility that the connection with the main body will be cut off, but it will be easy to ascertain that if both sides detect each other.</p><br/><p>After all, both are me.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a weird sensation, but Parallel Thought works without much difficulty, so there\u2019s no problem even when doing different actions.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a half-baked version like the one Vega used. It could be said that since Ciel had completed this\u300eMultiple Existence\u300fability, destroying me would be a nigh impossible task.</p><br/><p>Each of my\u300eMultiple Existence\u300fwere connected through the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d.</p><br/><p>That being said, I was still in the practice stage; it\u2019s the stage where I can\u2019t manifest unless I use the orb that I used to play with before.</p><br/><p>Oh well, if I keep on practicing soon I\u2019ll able to do it easily.</p><br/><p>So, even in the unlikely event that I die, it would end with just the orb being broken.</p><br/><p>Even in this situation, wondering how to soothe Milim\u2019s temper is a bigger problem for me, but that was just another story.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo-you are\u2026\u2026!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Garasha, Dino\u2019s companion, who I saved together with Gaia, asked me while looking at me with surprised eyes.</p><br/><p>I thought I knew her face, but I guess this was our first meeting.</p><br/><p>\u300cHm, ahh. Nice to meet you? I\u2019m Demon Lord Rimuru.\u300d</p><br/><p>I greeted her within the barrier.</p><br/><p>Garasha looks speechless and couldn\u2019t speak properly.</p><br/><p>Is she nervous? Oh well, I don\u2019t mind.</p><br/><p>Thus, I was able to retrieve both Gaia and Garasha safely, now all we needed to do was to wait till the storm calm down.</p><br/><p>As I thought that, I saw the \u201dDragon Core\u201d in the center of the tetrahedron.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you had that, you might become a real \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d too.\u300d</p><br/><p>I nonchalantly said so to Gaia who was being hugged by Garasha. That was a blunder.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t particularly plan to say so, and yet\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cKyui~~!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gaia jumped out from my\u300eNihility Barrier\u300f with an enthusiastic cry,</p><br/><p>\u300cWai-, you!\u300d</p><br/><p>I called out, but it was already too late.</p><br/><p>By the time my voice came out, Gaia was already outside the barrier.</p><br/><p>And then, Gaia got disintegrated instantly after being exposed to the ultra-high dense energy outside my barrier. The orb which represented Gaia broke apart and disappeared.</p><br/><p>That means Gaia has been annihilated.</p><br/><p>\u300aAs expected of Master. I thought the same thing too.\u300b</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I need to do for Milim to forgive me\u201d\u2015\u2015While I was thinking about such thing, I heard Ciel\u2019s calm voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What are you saying, Ciel?\u201d I questioned, but it can\u2019t be helped</p><br/><p>It\u2019s like I had led Gaia to suicide, it would be something that Milim will never forgive me for even if it was unintentional.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t really mean it when I said that Gaia can become a real \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ehh, it can\u2019t be!?</p><br/><p>At the same time that I thought of the possibility, the \u201cDragon Core\u201d conspicuously glowed and flickered at the center of the tetrahedron.</p><br/><p>\u300aYou\u2019re aware that a True Dragon won\u2019t really disappear, right?</p><br/><p>The same also applies to Zero who had become the insane, destructive \u201cBerserk Evil Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>He will revive again somewhere in the world and will just try to accomplish his mission as the \u201cBerserk Evil Dragon\u201d that was given to him by Velda.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the reason why Velda created the pseudo \u201cDragon Core\u201d called\u300eEvil Dragon Lord Azi Dahaka\u300f.</p><br/><p>However, this matter will be different if a new heart arises inside that \u201cDragon Core\u201d.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s Gaia who has fragments of Dragon Factor, it can be said that he possesses enough qualifications for it.\u300b</p><br/><p>As Ciel\u2019s explanation ended, a miracle was happening outside the barrier as if to prove her right.</p><br/><p>In short, Gaia became a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>I was just joking, but for my joke becoming reality is just scary.</p><br/><p>As there\u2019s a saying: \u201cTruth comes out of falsehood[10]\u201d, the words I said have really come true.</p><br/><p>Gaia got disintegrated instantly, but the heart that held the Will reached the \u201cDragon Core\u201d.</p><br/><p>Then, it seems Gaia has succeeded in taking it over.</p><br/><p>In the end, Ciel removed the insanity from it.</p><br/><p>All of the raging energy was suppressed and a beautiful blue dragon has manifested.</p><br/><p>Excluding me, Gaia can be called as the fifth \u2018True Dragon\u201d. After all, I\u2019m not really strictly a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>Gaia\u2019s body gave off an azure gleam more radiant than a jewel</p><br/><p>Unlike Veldora and his siblings, Gaia was shaped more like an oriental dragon.</p><br/><p>Is Gaia, Veldora\u2019s younger brother or younger sister?</p><br/><p>Whichever Gaia chooses to be, getting a new sibling is a good thing for that guy.</p><br/><p>\u300cKyui~~!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gaia gleefully, raised a happy cry.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t seem he can speak yet.</p><br/><p>Although he gained wisdom and knowledge fast enough, I guess that is because he was just now born.</p><br/><p>\u300cHaha, to think you would really succeed. Well done, Gaia!</p><br/><p>Oh right, in this opportunity, I\u2019ll think of a \u201cNickname\u201d for you as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora was called \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d while Velgrind was \u201cScorch Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>If he becomes their younger brother/sister, Gaia should also have an official name.</p><br/><p>Okay\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, I\u2019ve decided it. You\u2019re \u201cEarth Sovereign Dragon[11]\u201d from now on!</p><br/><p>As you\u2019re Veldora\u2019s brother, how about calling you as \u201cEarth Sovereign Dragon\u201d Velgaia?\u300d</p><br/><p>As he\u2019s glittering, I just named him without hesitation.</p><br/><p>That was the moment of the birth of the Fifth Dragon, \u201cEarth Sovereign Dragon\u201d Velgaia.</p><br/><p>As the surrounding power storm vanishes,\u300eAbsolute Barrier\u300fhas disappeared too.</p><br/><p>A beautiful dragon was born while the threat was gone.</p><br/><p>Diablo, Benimaru Zegion and even Dino and co.</p><br/><p>I see everyone flying towards me.</p><br/><p>However, since I was deprived of a lot of magic essence because of the naming, it became difficult to maintain my clone\u2019s existence\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Hey, even this count as naming too\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u300a\u2015\u2015Obviously\u2026...\u300b</p><br/><p>The last thing I heard was Ciel's amazed voice before I confirmed that the connection with the orb had been cut.</p><br/><p>You are reading this in Guro\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>[1] (\u30eb\u30b7\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb) Daten no Ou (Rushiferu).

Since general relativity states that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, nothing inside the event horizon can ever cross the boundary and escape beyond it, including light. Thus, nothing that enters a black hole can get out or can be observed from outside the event horizon.</p><br/><p>[8] Revolving lantern (Soumatou) refer to the flashback phenomenon before death according to Asian superstitions.

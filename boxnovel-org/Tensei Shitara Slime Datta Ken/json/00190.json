Crimson \u2013</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>His birth (manifestation) happened in the distant past.</p><br/><p>Born as an absolute being, he had sway over other beings with his Charisma.</p><br/><p>The embodiment of Pride.</p><br/><p>If he had grown like that, he could have been a being who would be called the King of the Underworld.</p><br/><p>It was somewhat of an accident for a being such as he to be brought into the over world, but this was an event that will end up changing his fate significantly.</p><br/><p>After arriving, he surveyed his surroundings.</p><br/><p>He understood immediately, that he had been summoned.</p><br/><p>The man who looked like the magician who summoned him was annoyingly spewing prideful words.</p><br/><p>His wish was to destroy the opposing country which his side was warring against.</p><br/><p>That was a simple matter.</p><br/><p>Using the wide range destruction magic \u2015\u2015Death Streak\u2015\u2015 without hesitation, he spread death easily.</p><br/><p>Millions perished and cities of death were created. He felt nothing from what has been done.</p><br/><p>But, attaining massive quantities of souls, he noticed he has ascended to a True Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>It seemed, just reaping ten thousand human souls, was enough to reach ascension.</p><br/><p>Then, what would happen if I collected even more souls? He was curious.</p><br/><p>Also, he wanted to \u201crepay\u201d the person, who decided to give him such a \u201cchore\u201d.</p><br/><p>He summoned two retainers \u2015\u2015Arc Demons\u2015\u2015 and gave them orders.</p><br/><p>Swiftly erase this country from the face of this world.</p><br/><p>He was currently in a good mood, having ascended.</p><br/><p>The point was that he had destroyed the residents of the country, that the magician who summoned him and gave him such a \u201cchore\u201d resided in, with no pain or suffering. That alone, proved how much of a good mood he was in.</p><br/><p>Also, the demons he summoned had the honor of being granted physical bodies.</p><br/><p>Thus, a once flourishing, but having been divided, great country, that wielded ancient super technologies, met it\u2019s demise.</p><br/><p>Such had happened thousands of years ago.</p><br/><p>Although a country ended up destroyed as his idea of an experiment and \u201cpayback\u201d, he collected even more souls, but there weren\u2019t any more changes.</p><br/><p>Which led him to understand, he cannot be strengthened any further.</p><br/><p>This marked the start of boring days to come, but Guy didn\u2019t mind.</p><br/><p>He roamed about everywhere, focused on enjoying the world for what it is.</p><br/><p>His life wasted on only battles and refining his Soul in the underworld, now seemed bleak in comparison to the stimulating outside world.</p><br/><p>Having fistfights with gigantic demon beasts, decimating self proclaimed monster kings with his magic.</p><br/><p>To the native humans, he was viewed and known as both as a God and a Devil at the same time, it was such a period.</p><br/><p>And then, they met.</p><br/><p>The one who created the world, the ultimate existence.</p><br/><p>\u201cStellar Dragon King\u201d Veldanava. He who had created the world they live in.</p><br/><p>Guy, who undoubtedly prided himself as one of the strongest alive, chose to challenge this being without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>And ended up utterly defeated.</p><br/><p>Guy was sent to the ground, as though there wasn\u2019t any resistance whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Never once doubting his was the strongest, his pride at that time, was utterly shattered.</p><br/><p>\u300cEnd me. I am satisfied.</p><br/><p>I now understand, that there will always be someone more capable out there in this world.</p><br/><p>In the ever continuing and unbreakable logic of this world, my existence too, is but a small part of it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLittle one.</p><br/><p>You see, I love all that have been born from me.</p><br/><p>This monotonous world, has been slowly but surely progressing.</p><br/><p>Intelligent beings are born, and they have now managed to attain the means to communicate with me.</p><br/><p>And now, beings that have the ability to go against me have emerged.</p><br/><p>A being such as you.</p><br/><p>But, if they keep progressing at their current pace, this world will be destroyed in but a few thousand years.</p><br/><p>For that, are you interested in cooperating with me?</p><br/><p>Cooperate with me, and become an \u201cArbitrator\u201d.\u300d</p><br/><p>The magic kingdom that he destroyed came to mind.</p><br/><p>Vying for authority, the foolish scene of strife despite being of the same kind.</p><br/><p>(I see, *that* was definitely deplorable.)</p><br/><p>There was nothing to hesitate about.</p><br/><p>As Guy had also grown fond of this world.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy not. What should I be doing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTo be as you are. I would like for you, to take the throne as a \u201cDemon Lord\u201d.</p><br/><p>To show the world what it means to be feared, so that man will not grow to be overly \u201cprideful\u201d.\u300d</p><br/><p>Pride.</p><br/><p>Looking back, this role perfectly fits me.</p><br/><p>It was a request, that obviously took into account that Guy wielded the unique skill\u300ePride\u300f.(TN: the skill\u2019s name *is* pride lol)</p><br/><p>\u300cVery well then. I shall take that throne, as a \u201cDemon Lord\u201d.</p><br/><p>If man were to grow too proud, I shall judge them in your stead.\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy dove deeper down now that his pride has been shattered once.</p><br/><p>And attained ultimate skill\u300ePride King Lucifer\u300f.</p><br/><p>A Demon Lord who had the power to rival God was born at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I leave it to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing Guy\u2019s reply, \u201cStellar Dragon King\u201d Veldanava chuckled happily.</p><br/><p>This was the moment, that Guy and Veldanava accepted each other as friends.</p><br/><p>Guy now lived his life as a Demon Lord as promised.</p><br/><p>But, that didn\u2019t actually mean he had much to do.</p><br/><p>Turning his attention to gathering intelligence, he now gave orders and recieved reports from his underling demons.</p><br/><p>Beside him stood the White Dragon.</p><br/><p>It was a beautiful Dragon, with Blue Diamond eyes.</p><br/><p>Perhaps having misunderstood something,</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m not accepting this, even if my elder brother has!\u300d(TN: past velzard was so adorable (&gt;\u03c9&lt;) )</p><br/><p>She detestably complained, seeming like she wanted a fight.</p><br/><p>Guy was feeling bored recently, so he decided to face her seriously.</p><br/><p>After battling for 3 days &amp; 3 nights, Guy\u2019s base of operations turned into a silver world blanketed in ice.</p><br/><p>Guy simply laughs it off, but for everyone else who lived there, it was a disaster.</p><br/><p>She was Veldanava\u2019s younger sister, and seemed to be jealous of Guy as he had been accepted by her brother.</p><br/><p>But, the seed of jealousy hadn\u2019t shown itself inside of her, so her real motive was probably to test Guy.</p><br/><p>In the end, she seemed to have found something interesting, and now followed alongside Guy.</p><br/><p>This, was how Guy met \u201cFrost Dragon\u201d Velzard.</p><br/><p>He shifted his headquarters to the Northern Continent.</p><br/><p>It was because the Aura (youki) leaking out from Velzard dropped the surrounding temperature.</p><br/><p>Since there was less impact on the surroundings up north, he decided to move his base there.</p><br/><p>At that time, Velzard had just learned to transform into her human form, but even more Aura was leaking because of that. (TN: velzard also had her time as a problem child (\u00b4\u03c9\uff40) )</p><br/><p>It was the right decision to move his home base. But that place had now became a land of permafrost that was void of any life, that was the only thing that was regretful.</p><br/><p>To distract himself away from his boredom, he began surveillance on a larger scale, focusing on locations which showed large scale advancement in livelihood.</p><br/><p>Although they looked scrawny when compared to \u201cthat place with super technology\u201d, the knowledge of magic and skills which were passed down, slowly began to resurface in their advancement.</p><br/><p>It was amusing to watch the humans.</p><br/><p>In time, villages became countries, and small scale skirmishes started to show up.</p><br/><p>Is it time for me to appear?</p><br/><p>As a warning, some countries were destroyed.</p><br/><p>The humans, in the face of the threat Guy posed, slowly gained the mentality of working together.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s good. Unless you get on my nerves, I won\u2019t be destroying your country!)</p><br/><p>Guy was fairly fulfilled, with his job as \u201cArbitrator\u201d.</p><br/><p>Time passed, and a few hundred years went by.</p><br/><p>On a certain day, to the bored Guy, a party came to challenge him.</p><br/><p>These intruders, managed to overcome the frozen lands which no man dare tread.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour\u2019s truly is Rudra. Rudra\u30fbNasca!</p><br/><p>A Hero of mankind, one who has shouldered the wishes of his people.</p><br/><p>Vile Demon Lord, time to meet your end! Also, give this one all of your treasures!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRudra nii-sama, you\u2019re acting like the demon lord now!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAhh, that\u2019s no good. He\u2019s getting blinded by greed.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s definitely gonna get his ass whooped.\u300d(EN: nii-sama = big brother, for you lesser weebs)</p><br/><p>Having such a conversation, a weird trio.</p><br/><p>Hero? What\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>Guy has been bored for so long, those words piqued his interest.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufun! Coz Your\u2019s truly is the strongest, I won\u2019t be needing help from you guys.</p><br/><p>Hey Demon Lord, I challenge you to a one-on-one battle!\u300d</p><br/><p>The good-looking young man who can be called a biseinen, charged in wearing his intricate full-body magic armor. (TN:maybe pretty boy for biseinen? lol)</p><br/><p>Should I easily evade or receive the attack. Maybe I should counterattack and make him regret his choice.</p><br/><p>Guy thought with Thought Acceleration, while looking at the 3 of them.</p><br/><p>But,</p><br/><p>\u300cNii-sama! At least have some support magic \u2015\u2015Holy Blade\u2015\u2015 !!\u300d</p><br/><p>The magic released from the silver haired girl, who looked to be his younger sister, enveloped Rudra\u2019s sword in light.</p><br/><p>It was a dazzling, eye catching light, which exudes a radiance that seemed to destroy evil.</p><br/><p>(Shit. That light could cut through all barriers!)</p><br/><p>Plus, he has been hiding his true strength, the young man\u2019s swinging sword accelerated towards Guy.</p><br/><p>At the last second, Guy parried the blow with his Demon Sword \u201cTenma\u201d.</p><br/><p>The young man, with his vivid sword techniques, gave Guy problems even when predicting his moves using \u201cClairvoyance\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, you\u2019re good! You are the first who managed to make me draw my sword!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHah! To think you would parry the attacks of Your\u2019s truly! This is gonna be fun, Demon Lord!</p><br/><p>Before this one destroys you, how about he hears your name?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow brazen, for a human\u2026.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m Guy.</p><br/><p>All who have faced me, end up screaming Giyaa\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc.</p><br/><p>Does that work as my name?</p><br/><p>It was a pain to think about, so I shortened it to Guy for my name.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026. Wait a sec.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not how names work. Names don\u2019t work that way at all!</p><br/><p>It won\u2019t be awesome if your\u2019s truly defeats a Demon Lord with such a weird name\u2026.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, your hair\u2019s a beautiful Cardinal Red color\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHold up. If you talk about Cardinal, you think of me. What are you doing giving away my name!?\u300d(EN: Velgrynd talking)</p><br/><p>\u300cNn? Ahh, I get it, what a noisy fella\u2026.</p><br/><p>Alright, Crimson then! How\u2019s that, no more problems right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026. it\u2019s kinda similar, but that\u2019s good i guess. Words don\u2019t really go into that thick head of yours\u2026.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGreat! Then it\u2019s decided. From today, you shall be \u201cDemon Lord\u201d Guy\u30fbCrimson!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus, \u201cDemon Lord\u201d Guy\u30fbCrimson was born.</p><br/><p>Because of what he did, the young man \u2015\u2015Rudra\u2015\u2015 lost consciousness, and ended up wandering the borders of life and death; his battle with Guy ended up getting delayed\u2026.</p><br/><p>Thinking back, Guy and Rudra\u2019s entwined fates may have started here.</p><br/><p>After Rudra recovered, they battled countless times.</p><br/><p>Rudra was powerful, calling himself a Hero was no fluke.</p><br/><p>The awakened Hero Rudra, and the ascended Demon Lord Guy.</p><br/><p>Rudra battled with the pinnacles of technique and skill, while Guy used his overflowing power and Skills.</p><br/><p>Although it was a stalemate for a period, it can be said Guy slowly was gaining the upper hand.</p><br/><p>Rudra\u2019s little sister, Lucia, and the beauty with the azure hair, \u201cScorch Dragon\u201d Velgrynd, speechlessly watched over the two of them.</p><br/><p>This has become something of a daily occurrence, since god knows when.</p><br/><p>On one such day,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey you! Even though you said to battle fair and square, isn\u2019t what you are doing too devious!?\u300d</p><br/><p>After obstructing his(Guy\u2019s) vision, Rudra cut Guy\u2019s stats down with a Holy Barrier, so Guy was voicing his complaints.</p><br/><p>\u300cJustice goes to the victorious! No, without victory, it is justice no more!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, Your\u2019s truly shall attain victory by any means!</p><br/><p>Also, that move you just used, that was a move this one used last time!</p><br/><p>Going around stealing other\u2019s moves\u2026. You\u2019re the devious one!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Retorted Rudra.</p><br/><p>Recently their strength has been comparable, being on the back foot probably made Rudra anxious.</p><br/><p>His declaration at the start was blown off elsewhere, and he was gunning for the victory by any means now.</p><br/><p>Though Guy looked like he was sighing, on the inside he was enjoying such conversations too.</p><br/><p>Having someone comparable as a sparring partner was amazing as it is, and just as Rudra said, he could vividly feel himself improving with each battle.</p><br/><p>Just attaining an Ultimate Skill isn\u2019t the end, mastering it\u2019s usage is where the real challenge lied.</p><br/><p>Although he was battling Rudra at his level, using only his sword, Guy was slowly overpowering Rudra.</p><br/><p>At this point, with Rudra pulling small tricks every so often, they ended with a tie, having no conclusion.</p><br/><p>But, if they went on like this, sooner or later Guy is going to emerge victorious.</p><br/><p>But\u2026.</p><br/><p>Guy felt something out of place.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi\u2026. You, during our first battle, why did you not defeat me then?</p><br/><p>If you didn\u2019t name me, and just came at me with everything you had, you would have won, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Proud as he is, as much as he didn\u2019t want to admit it, Guy still chose to ask Rudra this question.</p><br/><p>Just as Guy wielded\u300ePride King Lucifer\u300f, Rudra wielded\u300eJustice King Michael\u300f.</p><br/><p>If he went all out from the very start, he had a definite chance of doing damage to Guy.</p><br/><p>It was a fact, that Rudra had his chance at victory.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou dumbass! There\u2019s no meaning if Your\u2019s truly just *defeats* you!</p><br/><p>Getting you to acknowledge how awesome this one is, then turning over and becoming my ally.</p><br/><p>Your\u2019s truly, is the *Man* who\u2019s gonna rule the world.</p><br/><p>That, was his promise to his master \u201cStellar Dragon King\u201d Veldanava.\u300d</p><br/><p>That was his answer.</p><br/><p>To bring even himself(Guy) under his wing, the *Man* Rudra.</p><br/><p>Guy, was now conscious of the fact that he *liked* Rudra. (TN: inb4 yaoi shippin\u2019) (EN: ..inevitably!)</p><br/><p>That said, if he didn\u2019t, he would\u2019ve killed him immediately, it felt kind of moot at this point.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell that\u2019s that, on a serious note\u2026. If Your\u2019s truly went all out, he wouldn\u2019t be able to control it.</p><br/><p>Well, this\u300eJustice King Michael\u300f, is a power borrowed from Veldanava\u2026.\u300d</p><br/><p>After listening to what Rudra had to say, although it was unexpected, Guy found himself accepting the circumstances.</p><br/><p>If\u2026 It was a power that was a part of Veldanava, having the capability to defeat me isn\u2019t hard to imagine.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat the. That would make this\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Meaningless, was what Guy was about to say, but his voice was muffled by the roar of an explosion.</p><br/><p>The cause, was a fight among sisters, between Velzard and Velgrynd.</p><br/><p>It seems, that due to their newborn brother\u2019s selfishness, he was out rampaging about as he liked.</p><br/><p>They were pushing the responsibility onto each other, saying Velzard\u2019s severe discipline being the cause, and Velgrynd\u2019s spoiling him being the cause. (TN: lol wut?) (EN: I.. want doujins NOW!)</p><br/><p>This was something he was used to already, but Guy thought it would be nice if they could do it somewhere else so as not to be a nuisance to others.</p><br/><p>Guy and Rudra took cover so they won\u2019t be dragged in.</p><br/><p>He kinda lost interest in their fight.</p><br/><p>His position as Demon Lord, was something that he was doing for Veldanava in the first place.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be helped that he was unable to get serious about his battles with Rudra, who was also Veldanava\u2019s friend.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re done here! I really like you. (TN: as a person) (EN: don\u2019t add words to his mouth!)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, I won\u2019t be killing you, nor will I fight you for real.</p><br/><p>But, to stop the world from falling apart, I\u2019ll stay in my position as Demon Lord.\u300d</p><br/><p>Just as Guy said that while looking Rudra in the eyes, (TN: woot moar shippin!)</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, then. Why don\u2019t we have a \u201cGame\u201d?\u300d</p><br/><p>Rudra said that, while trying his hardest to hide his half embarrassed half laughing face. (TN: we be shippin!) (EN: it seems Rudra is the uke~)</p><br/><p>\u300cA \u201cGame\u201d?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.</p><br/><p>This one and you, with our respective pawns, we fight for conquest of this world.</p><br/><p>Your\u2019s tru-\u2026 I believe that it is possible to unite the humans.</p><br/><p>I was able to become friends with someone like you.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need for a \u201cDemon Lord\u201d or \u201cArbitrator\u201d.</p><br/><p>Veldanava was being obstinate with his ideals\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>But I have persuaded him and got his approval.</p><br/><p>Even though the chances are amazingly close to zero, I\u2019ll be doing everything I possibly can.</p><br/><p>\u300eJustice King Michael\u300f\u2019s Armageddon, will bring forth an army of angels that will destroy everything.</p><br/><p>But, I\u2019ll give it my all to control this power.</p><br/><p>If humans advance too much, military power and civilization will become collateral.</p><br/><p>And, I shall unite this world, and create a utopia!</p><br/><p>So, I would like you to stop going around slaughtering humans.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHah! It\u2019s not as though mindless slaughter is a hobby of mine.</p><br/><p>I only kill those who annoy me.</p><br/><p>It matters not whether they are kind or villainous.</p><br/><p>If I like them I let them live, I kill them if I don\u2019t.</p><br/><p>But, well\u2026. Why not?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m bored anyway.</p><br/><p>I shall not take the field personally, and instead I\u2019ll gather up other Demon Lords, and they shall represent me.</p><br/><p>Now, your goal is to conquer the world before it becomes one that is under total control of the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>I give you my word that I will not directly interfere.</p><br/><p>But, I will continue my work as the \u201cjudge\u201d.</p><br/><p>It is my promise with Veldanava as the \u201cArbitrator\u201d.</p><br/><p>Also, as a \u201cHero\u201d, you should already know right?</p><br/><p>Heroes, are they who wield the greatest power, the avatars of justice.</p><br/><p>Armageddon as it is, is a greater deterrent compared to the threat of Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>It is a \u201cprogram\u201d meant to destroy the world, prepared for when the \u201cArbitrator\u201d abandons his job.</p><br/><p>Veldanava is a perfectionist, not a romanticist.</p><br/><p>After seeing intelligent beings finally being born after several hundred million years, he sees the need to manage them so they don\u2019t end up destroying themselves.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, even so!</p><br/><p>I, have the obligation to bring him peace of mind.</p><br/><p>Veldanava, has consummated with my sister.</p><br/><p>And, Lucia has been blessed with Veldanava\u2019s child.</p><br/><p>Veldanava now, is no different from a normal human.</p><br/><p>He had always been alone, as someone who wasn\u2019t bound by the concept of a lifespan; that Veldanava confided to me while smiling.</p><br/><p>He has found happiness being together with Lucia, but even now he still worries for the future!</p><br/><p>Ever more so, for the future of his child\u2026.</p><br/><p>That is the reason why I need to let him settle down.</p><br/><p>To let him see, how much this world that he has created, has matured, has become a wonderful balanced world\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>To Rudra\u2019s words, Guy had none to return.</p><br/><p>In his head, although he thought of and denied multiple possibilities, he ended up understanding Rudra\u2019s feelings.</p><br/><p>He was vexed, at his own brilliant mind.</p><br/><p>(What the hell man, you idiot\u2026.

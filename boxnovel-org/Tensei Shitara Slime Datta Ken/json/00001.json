This is my first translation project, and I am only getting up to speed. The initial translation for this chapter, with some 1600 words, took me about 1 hour 40 minutes. I am testing the waters and seeing how doable this is while experimenting with style and such. Please offer me criticism and suggestions. Enjoy:</p><br/><p>Prologue \u2013 Death and Reincarnation</p><br/><p>A life so normal that nothing can be said about it.</p><br/><p>After leaving college, I joined a major general contractor firm and am living alone now at the age of 37. Having no girlfriend.</p><br/><p>Filial duty left to my older brother, my life is essentially that of an independent, single noble.</p><br/><p>Neither short of height, or wanting of a good face. Yet unpopular. I have tried exherting effort into finding a girlfriend \u2013 and have confessed thrice! \u2013 but after being dumped, my heart is left shattered. Well, having reached this age, I can honestly say that this romance thing is naught but troublesome.</p><br/><p>And although you could say that I am mostly busy with work, it\u2019s not like I am troubled by not having one. It\u2019s not like I am making excuses\u2026 really.</p><br/><p>\u300cSenpai! Sorry for keeping you waiting!\u300d</p><br/><p>With a cheerful smile the young man approaches me. And, by his side\u2013a beauty.</p><br/><p>More specifically, the young man, Tamura, is a junior at the same company I work at; the one by his side is our company\u2019s renowned Madonna, the receptionist Sawatari-san.</p><br/><p>Yep, I have been asked by these guys to offer consultation on their upcoming marriage. And by the way, this is the reason why I started wondering about my own unpopularity.</p><br/><p>The after-work rendezvous was held at an intersection, and there the two hoped to indulge my thoughtfulness and support.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. So, what kind of advice are you looking for?\u300d</p><br/><p>I ask while greeting Sawatari-san.</p><br/><p>\u300cHello, pleased to meet you.My name is Sawatari Miho. Although we have seen each other before, this would be the first time we are speaking, right? Makes me nervous, somehow. \u300d</p><br/><p>The nervous one is me, damn it! I mean, I am not that good with speaking to girls in the first place. Cut me some slack! With such words, I silently complain to myself.</p><br/><p>And in the first place, with no apparent love experience, what kind of advice can I even offer? Aren\u2019t you all just poking fun at me! It\u2019s spite, isn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>\u300cHello. I am Mikami Satoru. No need to be nervous or anything. Sawatari-san is famous with us, so I know who you are even without the introduction. About Tamura\u2013we went to the same University, you know, so we\u2019ve had lots to talk about. After which we naturally hung out a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s this about being famous? Are there weird rumors floating about?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. Like having had an affair with Chief X, or going on dates with Y-kun\u2013things like that.\u300d</p><br/><p>It was all just teasing, of course. And although I intended these to be just some light jokes, Sawatari-san\u2019s face turned bright red and she looked at me with watery eyes. Hate to admit it, but she looked adorable.</p><br/><p>Well, my jokes lack both delicacy or tact, and I am often told to keep my mouth shut\u2026 but I end up saying them anyways.</p><br/><p>Yep, failed again, huh? Yep, I am just bad with women.</p><br/><p>And as if on cue, in steps Tamura, lightly tapping her shoulders.</p><br/><p>Damn it, Tamura you bastard! It\u2019s these situations where you riajuu should just all explode! I should shout this, right?</p><br/><p>\u300cSenpai, please leave it at that! And, Miho, you are just being teased!\u300d</p><br/><p>With a laugh Tamura continues mediating the situation. Aren\u2019t you dandy, junior!</p><br/><p>Bright, cheerful, and without a hint of sarcasm. Isn\u2019t he a lovable guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Tamura\u2019s only 28. And although we are so many years apart, we\u2019ve got something in common. Well, nothing to do I guess but to give them my blessing\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cMy bad. I\u2019m just not that good with women. And, well, the location doesn\u2019t help much, does it? Let\u2019s get something to eat and talk there.\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just jealousy, after all. And just when I thought so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cKyaaaaaaaaaa!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Screams. Confusion.</p><br/><p>What? What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>\u300cMove it! I\u2019ll kill you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Turning to the sound of the voice, a man brandishing a knife and holding a bag is running towards us.</p><br/><p>I hear the scream. I see the man. I see the knife. Where is it pointing? At\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u300cTamuraaa!\u300d</p><br/><p>*Don* I hit Tamura out of the way.</p><br/><p>*Dosu* There\u2019s a burning pain in my back.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch, damn hindrance!\u300d</p><br/><p>Having shouted thus, I see the man escaping and turn to make sure Tamura and Sawatari-san are safe.</p><br/><p>With a shout that resembled no words, Tamura runs up to me.</p><br/><p>Sawatari-san is stunned by the sudden turn of events, but appears without other injury\u2026 thank god.</p><br/><p>That being that, my back burns. Feelings of pain aside, it just burns.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s up with this? It\u2019s too hot\u2026 can\u2019t it let off a bit?</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cConfirmed. Establishing heat resistance. Success\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026 was I stabbed?</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t be dying from a stab wound\u2026.</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cConfirmed. Establishing pierce resistance. Success. Additionally, establishing physical attack resistance. Success\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>\u300cSenpai\u2026 there\u2019s blood coming out\u2026 it\u2019s not stopping\u2026 it\u2019s ain\u2019t\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s up with this loud guy. Feel like his voice was strange just now; well, that much can be expected from Tamura.</p><br/><p>But blood? Yeah, that\u2019s clearly leaving. I am human, after all. When stabbed, I bleed!</p><br/><p>But pain is unpleasant, isn\u2019t it\u2026.</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cConfirmed. Removing perception of pain. Success\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 this is bad, right? Pain and impatience are muddling my senses.</p><br/><p>\u300cTa\u2026 Tamura\u2026 you are damn loud. It\u2026 is not that big of deal, right? Stop worrying\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSenpai\u2026 the blood\u2026 you keep\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>His face blue, on the verge of tears, Tamura continues to hold me. That\u2019s the face that is the ruin of handsome men.</p><br/><p>I tried to take a look at how Sawatari-san was doing, but my vision is too hazy. Can\u2019t see.</p><br/><p>The burning sensation in my back is gone. Instead, a ferocious cold strikes me.</p><br/><p>This could be bad\u2026 when people don\u2019t have enough blood, they die, don\u2019t they?</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cConfirmed. Creating a bloodless body. Success\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>(Hey, you, what\u2019s this you\u2019ve been going on about the past few minutes\u2026.)</p><br/><p>I try to speak, but no words come out. This is bad, maybe I really will die\u2026.</p><br/><p>But hey, I no longer feel neither pain nor the burning.</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s cold. So cold, and nothing I can do about it. What\u2019s with this\u2026 I am too busy of a man to be freezing in this cold.</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cConfirmed. Establishing cold resistance. Success. Additionally, heat resistance has successfully evolved into thermal fluctuation resistance EX\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>At that time, the dying brain cells of mine, with a flash of inspiration, have remembered the truly important things!</p><br/><p>Yes! The contents of my PC hard drive!</p><br/><p>\u300cTamuraa!! If and only if, I say, I die\u2026 take care of my PC. I beg you\u2026 submerge it in water, turn it on, and completely wipe the data clean\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus I, having summoned the remainder of my strength, have conveyed the matters of most grave importance.</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cConfirmed. Attempting full format of all information. Error, impossible due to lack of definition. Attempting alternate interpretation. Establishing electricity resistance. Success. Additionally, paralysis resistance has been acquired\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know exactly what Tamura was saying at that moment, while giving me that blank look.</p><br/><p>But, I understood the meaning of what was said.</p><br/><p>\u300cHaha\u2026 that\u2019s so like Senpai\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>He said with a bitter smile. Who would even want to look at a man\u2019s crying face? That grin is so many times better.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou know, I\u2026 about Sawatari, I wanted to show her off to senpai\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Heh, I knew it.. .this bastard.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch\u2026 jeez. I\u2019ve forgiven all of it, so your girlfriend, make her happy, got it? And take care of the PC\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The last of my strength, was only enough to say that much.</p><br/><p>Completely unsatisfied, Mikami Satoru died.</p><br/><p>And at that instant, Mikami Satoru\u2019s \u201csoul\u201d linked with a spawned monster in another world.</p><br/><p>Into a dimensional crack so small that no eye could see. His soul linked with a mass of demonic energy.</p><br/><p>This mass was the origin of demons, and to Mikami Satoru who had linked to it, his thoughts as a base, the mass constructed a body.</p><br/><p>What is normally is essentially an impossibility with an astronomically small chance of occurrence, Mikami Satoru was reborn as a monster in another world.</p><br/><p>A life so normal that nothing can be said about it.</p><br/><p>After leaving college, I joined a major general contractor firm and am living alone now at the age of 37. Having no girlfriend.</p><br/><p>Filial duty left to my older brother, my life is essentially that of an independent, single noble.</p><br/><p>Thus, a virgin.</p><br/><p>Unbelievable, departing the world without ever been put to use\u2026 my \u2018son\u2019 must be crying right now.</p><br/><p>Sorry, I never could make you into an adult\u2026</p><br/><p>When I am reborn, we\u2019ll change things around. Go on the offensive with a bang. Call them out, and go on devouring spree\u2026. But that\u2019s no good, is it?</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cConfirmed. Unique skill [Predator] has been acquired\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>And well, at almost forty years old, the thirty year old virgin that I am, in a magical world would certainly be a sage\u2026 heck, a great sage wouldn\u2019t be out of the question, would it?</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cConfirmed. Extra skill [Sage] has been acquired. Additionally, extra skill [Sage] has successfully evolved into unique skill [Great Sage] \uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>\u2026. the hell you\u2019ve been on about? The hell is [Great Sage]! Are you making fun of me?</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t even a bit unique!</p><br/><p>I am not laughing here!</p><br/><p>So rude..</p><br/><p>Thinking that, I went to sleep.</p><br/><p>(So this is death, huh\u2026 not as lonesome as I thought.)</p><br/><p>Those were, for Mikami Satoru, the lost words spoken in this word.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even in your dreams, you can\u2019t even win with Magnus and his party like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>The combat type instructor Brown shouted passionately, as if he was a different person. Even the three other accompanying instructors also looked like they were having a hard time. Instructor Brown\u2019s last spurt was that bloodcurdling.</p><br/><p>One of the instructors, Peter, even said,</p><br/><p>\u201cB-brown-sensei, the-there\u2019s no need to be that intense from the start now\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>And acted as proxy for the students.</p><br/><p>However, such a remark from instructor Peter too was thrown away easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe quiet! If we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re doing this to win! Shouldn\u2019t we make frantic efforts with that spirit? Am I wrong? If you\u2019re going to be like that, you\u2019re never going to get the reward from Rimu\u2014Satoru-sensei!\u201d</p><br/><p>But still, this guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Hasn\u2019t his objective changed?</p><br/><p>Moreover, wasn\u2019t he just about to casually call out my name? That is kinda worrying.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it seems I was in the wrong. Rimu\u2014I mean, Satoru-sensei is watching. We are not allowed to be lenient\u2014You guys, get psyched up!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Peter-sensei! We are in no position to be compromising! Now, you guys\u2014run as if your life depends on it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201dYEAAHH!!\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>U-umm\u2026</p><br/><p>It seems instructor Peter was also the same.</p><br/><p>Why are the instructors being all serious?!</p><br/><p>You\u2019re leaving the students behind.</p><br/><p>But, that\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s fine but\u2026 the students, did they get brainwashed over this past week or something?</p><br/><p>Their eyes fired up and they started running desperately.</p><br/><p>They ran at full speed, using all their remaining strength and even more perhaps.</p><br/><p>Using the optimum distribution of their energy and magic to reduce their exhaustion simultaneously.</p><br/><p>What is it that\u2019s stirring up these students this much?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 they aren\u2019t aiming for the reward I talked about\u2026 are they?</p><br/><p>I could only pray that it was my imagination that made it look like they wanted the reward more than letting Magnus and the others have a piece of their mind.</p><br/><p>Until night came that day, they had been doing the long runs.</p><br/><p>As expected, everyone was completely exhausted.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

I had the ingredients so I prepared enough for everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered with a smile.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a complete lie but I can\u2019t really say that \u201cI made it by mixing with the restoration medicine I had on me all this time\u201d so I don\u2019t really have a choice.</p><br/><p>Ah, that reminds me, this is a bit late but I am glad that the \u201cmonsters can\u2019t lie\u201d thing has no effect on me.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like I like deceiving people or anything but considering my personality and position, I am in situations where I can\u2019t say the truth a lot.</p><br/><p>\u2026.No, it isn\u2019t really a lie either, is it?</p><br/><p>If you were to broadly interpret it, \u201csecret recipe\u201d, \u201cI had ingredients\u201d, or \u201cI prepared for enough for everyone\u201d\u2013all these aren\u2019t really lies.</p><br/><p>Just the \u201cI had ingredients\u201d part would be more accurate if I had said \u201cI had it in my Imaginary Space so that might just be a bit strained.</p><br/><p>Well, that stuff doesn\u2019t really matter either way.</p><br/><p>The moment everyone recovered from their exhaustion after drinking the beverage I prepared, they realized that they were starving, as well.</p><br/><p>And it immediately became time for the left over squad to prepare dinner.</p><br/><p>It seems the group in charge of cooking gave it their all so the dishes this time around were satisfying, as well.</p><br/><p>I had the magic using students go through practical training of making containers using earth magic and tempering using combustion magic.</p><br/><p>As a result, everyone\u2019s tableware was also prepared.</p><br/><p>Although there are some which are oddly-shaped, they have their own attractiveness.</p><br/><p>And like this, we were able to enjoy a good meal on the night of the 5th day as well.</p><br/><p>Now then, hunger has been satisfied but\u2026</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>It is about time their ability to think also recovered and they start to feel discontent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSatoru\u2014sensei\u2026. there\u2019s something I would like to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Julius said and stood up.</p><br/><p>It seems he had some resistance in calling me sensei but he appears to have suppressed his pride and acknowledged me as their teacher.</p><br/><p>A more honest guy than I had first thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t really do anything other than running today but will we really be able to beat them like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stupid? Of course you won\u2019t get strong by just running. If you could win with just that, nobody would have to work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha\u2013!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems my words offended him as he looked on the verge of losing it.</p><br/><p>We made them run all day long without letting them think. And on top of that, I just said something that could also be interpreted to mean that there\u2019s no point in running.</p><br/><p>In a manner of speaking, it is like saying that you wasted the entire day.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

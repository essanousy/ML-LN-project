It\u2019s messier than the Legend of Zelda series -_-.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord\u2019s Gambit Arc</p><br/><p>131. Demon Lord Leon</p><br/><p>While looking at Rimuru that sat in front of him, Leon recalled the old days.</p><br/><p>With an appearance of a shoujo, a genderless Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Even though it belonged to the weakest race the slimes, it evolved into a demon lord with a vast magic capacity.</p><br/><p>It was a unique existence, with the appearance of Izawa Shizu, a girl whom he once saved.</p><br/><p>And he was someone who knew this girl, whom Leon was looking for.</p><br/><p>When you think about it, this is quite the peculiar twist of fate.</p><br/><p>Although a visitor from Earth, he came as a \u201creincarnator\u201d with the memories of his previous life\u2014an unbelievable occurrence. Moreover, he reincarnated as a monster.</p><br/><p>Such was Demon Lord Rimuru: a being who met with this world\u2019s strongest species, Dragon Kind, who was fated to deal with Leon, and who attained absolute power.</p><br/><p>But doesn\u2019t this all appear as if it were all connected, as if someone was leading it?</p><br/><p>He thought.</p><br/><p>This all just may be pre-established harmony.</p><br/><p>TN Note: Pre-established harmony is the idea that while substances only affect themselves, god programmed the way they interact and harmonize with each other\u2026just look it up.</p><br/><p>However, Leon disregarded the idea and began talking about the girl Chloe.</p><br/><p>About 300 years ago, Leon came to this world.</p><br/><p>Rather than being summoned, the cause of this was being caught in the accidental occurrence of a dimensional distortion.</p><br/><p>Veldora has already been sealed then, and the great Jura Forest has already been established as a inviolable zone.</p><br/><p>Despite the relative peace which the world had finally welcome, Leon was thrown into it.</p><br/><p>At the time he was less than 10 years old.</p><br/><p>However, there was someone who he had to protect. There was a young girl who fell along with him. That girl, was Chloe O\u2019Bell.</p><br/><p>She was a childhood friend of Leon, a best friend. An existence he loved like a sister, his everything.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Leon, even as his body was being destroyed by rampaging magic, he forcefully suppressed the destruction with his willpower.</p><br/><p>With a strong will and feelings, a boy who was less than 10 had managed to control the magic that dwelt within him. As a result, he had obtained the unique skill \u201cGuardian\u201d.</p><br/><p>From his desires to protect the girl younger than he, the power to protect has awakened within him.</p><br/><p>Moreover that wasn\u2019t all. By obtaining a \u201chero\u2019s egg\u201d, a portion of the remaining rampart energy was obtained.</p><br/><p>Even at a young age, Leon had the qualities of a Hero.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s alright. Because I will protect Chloe\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon cheered up the young girl, who was crying endlessly, with a smile</p><br/><p>However, the girl in Leon\u2019s embrace suddenly vanished. Despite the power to protect had just awaken with Leo\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>And so, Leon began the journey to search for Chloe.</p><br/><p>Despite the passing years Leon never gave up searching for Chloe.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, she had returned back to their original world. So he considered.</p><br/><p>Even in their original world, however, Chloe had no relatives. If Leon didn\u2019t protect her, who would?</p><br/><p>In that case, all he had to do was to summon her here again.</p><br/><p>He learned of magic that could summon a specific person through appointing time and space.</p><br/><p>With his exceptional intelligence, Leon learned magic at an absurd pace. All to summon a single girl, and to protect her.</p><br/><p>However, his attempts ended in failure.</p><br/><p>Even the genius Leon could not exert magical power in a world beyond this one.</p><br/><p>Yet he did not give up and continued his research.</p><br/><p>An extreme magic that could only be attempted once every 66 years, for success he traveled the world.</p><br/><p>He learned from the fairies the method to be certified a hero, but they were so useless that it merely infuriated him.</p><br/><p>He seized from them 8 great spirits, and because it did not seem to have caused any great problem, he continued his journey.</p><br/><p>Having reached the pinnacle of human wisdom, he left into domains of the demon lords.</p><br/><p>Leon\u2019s thirst for knowledge was boundless; he would not hesitate to do whatever it takes for the sake of summoning Chloe.</p><br/><p>Thus, he continued living while destroying high ranking devils and taking their wisdom for his own.</p><br/><p>There were also those who wish to join as his subordinate, who were allowed to do as they pleased so long as they did not interfere.</p><br/><p>As time went by, the number of subordinates under Leon gradually grew in size, and he even came to own a small territory.</p><br/><p>Leon never named himself, but soon the name \u201cPlatinum Devil\u201d began to spread.</p><br/><p>Before long, that name came to be associated with the name of a Demon Lord, but Leon paid it no mind. That sort of thing didn\u2019t matter to him.</p><br/><p>Rather, taking knowledge from the wise devils who came to fight him was most important.</p><br/><p>And for the first time, an existence that could be called a threat attacked Leon.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurse lord\u201d Kazalim, was offended by Leon\u2019s nickname of demon lord, and paid a visit to purge him.</p><br/><p>Even for Leon, the genius with a \u201cHero\u2019s egg\u201d, the \u201cCurse Lord\u201d Kazalim was a formidable foe.</p><br/><p>Superficial attacks will not work on Kazalim, king of the undead. With Leon\u2019s abilities specializing in defense, he couldn\u2019t inflict a fatal strike on Kazalim.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Kazalim too found Leon a difficult opponent. Breaking through he iron wall-like defense was tough, and all his curses were null and void.</p><br/><p>With both sides lacking a decisive factor, the battle that unfolded extended for several days.</p><br/><p>However, the ending was a disappointing one.</p><br/><p>His egg hatched.</p><br/><p>Absorbing his pure feelings within the inner soul of Leon, the \u201cHero\u2019s egg\u201d had hatched.</p><br/><p>Leon has awakened and became a true hero.</p><br/><p>He who reigns as the demon lord, he who is the true hero. And that, is Leon Cromwell.</p><br/><p>He awakened an ability, the ultimate skill \u201cKing of purity Metatron\u201d.</p><br/><p>An ability which draws purest energy possible from power, magic, aura, and skill.</p><br/><p>For Kazalim who uses complex skills this was the worst possible match-up.</p><br/><p>With cursed blood of hex and blood, rotten flesh of sludge and microorganisms, bones of magic water.</p><br/><p>The parts that constitutes Kazalim\u2019s body, was dismantled under the pulsating divine light of the ultimate skill \u201cKing of Purity Metatron\u201d.</p><br/><p>Without being able to put up any resistance, the \u201cCurse lord\u201d Kazalim has been destroyed before Leon.</p><br/><p>By an ironic twist, Leon who has overthrown a demon lord was recognized as a demon lord in name and in reality. And Leon took it as a good thing.</p><br/><p>In the castle where Kazalim resides, an experimentation facility was established.</p><br/><p>In addition to it being used as an experimentation facility, he began considering his place of residence.</p><br/><p>When Chloe was successfully summoned, he needed to give her a place to live. So Leon thought, and decided to get his own territory.</p><br/><p>And he discovered new lands to the southwest.</p><br/><p>Extreme magic was used without holding back to reform the very ecology itself.</p><br/><p>And thus, the golden town El\u30fbDorado was completed. However, Leon has conducted research exclusively in Kazarim\u2019s residence in the demon continent until\u2026</p><br/><p>His summoning has failed, and Izawa Shizu was summoned.</p><br/><p>Her condition could be understood with a simple glance.</p><br/><p>Unlike Leon, this girl with burnt raven black hair has suffered grievous injuries and would soon die.</p><br/><p>Due to his failed summoning, this girl\u2019s body may soon collapse under the rampaging magic.</p><br/><p>However, age wise it was a success. Which pleased him. Furthermore, if it wasn\u2019t for his summon, this girl would have burned to death.</p><br/><p>Leon was slightly troubled. Calling this helping would be presumptuous. After all she was summoned for his own convenience.</p><br/><p>If the girl was saved as a result, this was due to her own luck, and not Leon\u2019s efforts.</p><br/><p>And so he thought.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s why,</p><br/><p>\u300cAlthough I thought you were trash, you seem compatible with fire.\u300d</p><br/><p>After saying so, the \u201cFlame Giant\u201d Ifrit was summoned, and possessed the young girl. The high ranking spirit stolen from Ramiris\u2019s dungeon now proved useful.</p><br/><p>The girl was stabilized, and snatched from the jaws of death.</p><br/><p>After that all depends on the girl\u2019s luck.</p><br/><p>It is not a result of his actions, but the girl\u2019s own: for she should be the one to strive to create her own path.</p><br/><p>In addition, Leon could not afford to get involved with the girl.</p><br/><p>Leon was Leon, the girl was the girl; and she had to figure out her own life. It may seem cold, but such is the law of the jungle.</p><br/><p>Leon had thoroughly considered this, and he had no reason to carry the heavy burden of the young girl\u2019s fate.</p><br/><p>At that time, Leon had not noticed his whimsical actions would create such a twisted tapestry of fate.</p><br/><p>And thus, the weaver of fate had spun yet another pattern.</p><br/><p>Before Leo, a young boy has appeared.</p><br/><p>The Young boy called himself Kagurazaka Yuuki.</p><br/><p>The young leader of the Freedom Association has told Leon that his organization would be useful to him.</p><br/><p>He seems to have heard about Leon\u2019s search for the \u201cOtherworldly\u201d Young girl through illicit means.</p><br/><p>Confidently, he boasted he could help Leon find the girl he seeks.</p><br/><p>On a whim, Leon permitted it.</p><br/><p>Either way, he would not be harmed if Yuuki had failed.</p><br/><p>No matter how many years it took, he was determined to successfully summon Chloe with his own two hands.</p><br/><p>After deciding to giving it a try due to no potential loss, the characteristics of Chloe was conveyed, and the proposal was accepted.</p><br/><p>When you think about it, that was his biggest blunder.</p><br/><p>Kagurazaka Yuuki had successfully summoned</p><br/><p>Chloe O\u2019Bell.</p><br/><p>He had succeeded.</p><br/><p>Not from another world, but rather from when Chloe and Leon first came to this world.</p><br/><p>In other words, if he hasn\u2019t relied on Yuuki, fate might have turned out differently.</p><br/><p>Chloe was summoned by Yuuki, met the monster called Rimuru, and traveled to the past alongside Hinata.</p><br/><p>Trapped in the laws of the perfect world, Chloe had awakened her own ultimate skill whilst repelling all external interferences.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for Yuuki, Leon\u2019s summoning might have actually succeeded.</p><br/><p>However, that was something that already could not be determined.</p><br/><p>Whether Leon would eventually succeed in his otherworld summoning or not, there was no long any point in speculating about this.</p><br/><p>Because the problem now was what to do in the future.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Leon\u2019s story finished.</p><br/><p>The black tea has long cooled. While we were talking, time has slipped by.</p><br/><p>Or rather, the fact that Leon has been trying to summon Chloe was unexpected.</p><br/><p>When the hero attacked his facility, he had this strange unexplainable feeling he should avoid confrontation.</p><br/><p>And so, he decided \u2015\u2015Even though he wouldn\u2019t say it\u2015\u2015 to leave Shizu san in the care of the hero who came, and said he would withdraw.</p><br/><p>When you think about it, it was easy to explain.</p><br/><p>Although there\u2019s no way Leon could have known, this was all a pre-established harmony created by Chloe\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>I, to complement Leon\u2019s memories, told my side of the story.</p><br/><p>My encounters and farewells with Chloe, as well as Yuuki\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>In addition, what Hinata and Ruminas told me about the current hero Chloe.</p><br/><p>Leon had believed the words I said, and shared information that would only be known to Leon.</p><br/><p>After the last of the cold tea was drunk,</p><br/><p>\u300cIn other words, Chloe\u2019s currently under the control of Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Due to the unique curse \u201cThree absolute orders\u201d Chloe could not go against Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Ruminas and I had tried to subjugate Yuuki, but unfortunately he was one step ahead and he escaped.</p><br/><p>From now on, when Yuuki makes his move, we will be fighting against him.</p><br/><p>Our objective is also to free Chloe, do you think it is possible for us to cooperate?\u300d</p><br/><p>I got to the point.</p><br/><p>I thought about asking Demon Lord Leon to join forces against Yuuki, or so I did but,</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph, I don\u2019t particularly mind cooperating.</p><br/><p>My wish was to summon Chloe was a wish to protect her happiness.</p><br/><p>However, if there were any hindrances isn\u2019t it natural that they be eradicated?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s leave the question of whether Chloe really is the strongest aside for now.</p><br/><p>And, how do I even know you\u2019ll be at all useful in this?\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems we must first have a proper grasp of each other\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>Alright. If that\u2019s what he wants, then I\u2019ll present him with a blow as previously requested by Shizu san.</p><br/><p>TN Note: he meant Shizu san\u2019s will to give Leon a beating. Chapter 25ish.</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay! I understand.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m fine with ending this bothersome conversation. You should prepare yourself.</p><br/><p>Unlike Ramiris, my punch isn\u2019t all talk!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu, come at me\u300d</p><br/><p>We laughed at each other, and stood simultaneously.</p><br/><p>We headed for the training grounds. Where Shion and the silver knight Alrose had previously headed.</p><br/><p>Lead by Leon we ventured into the palace. Sculptures and corridors of good taste from his hobbies decorated the halls, while glass walls allowed overviewing the view outside.</p><br/><p>This is a fantastically elaborate palace. Of course I don\u2019t say so and quietly follow behind Leon.</p><br/><p>We arrived to the training grounds.</p><br/><p>A magic formation was carved into one side of the wall, which seems to serve the purpose of absorbing and diffusing the energy absorbed within.</p><br/><p>With this in place, a bit of violence wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>So I thought as we entered unto the grounds.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Inside, Shion had an uncomfortable look on her face.</p><br/><p>And that person over there that looks like a dust cloth rag constantly twitching and convulsing seems to be the silver knight Alrose.</p><br/><p>I sudden felt cold sweat running down my spine.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-it\u2019s n-not what you think!</p><br/><p>He was earnest! And so in response I too got serious.</p><br/><p>However, while he was evading with teleport, I felt a tingling feeling and attacked\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When I noticed, Alrose-dono was in this state!</p><br/><p>What the hell was that, I too am deeply troubled about this!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is that meant to be an excuse?</p><br/><p>I wanted to seriously look into the matter, but now\u2019s not the time.</p><br/><p>I quickly took out a full potion, and sprinkled it over Silver knight Alrose.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, I had Alrose drink another bottle after he was finally conscious enough to drink.</p><br/><p>\u300cT-that w-was my defeat. I did not expect Shion-dono to be so skillful\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I am sorely lacking in training\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Apparently, he seems fine.</p><br/><p>Now that\u2019s relieved, there\u2019s the problem child Shion.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, Shion\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>When I called, Shion instantly shrank and sat in Seiza.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you properly understand our purpose for coming here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy, of course. We\u2019re here to\u2026 \u201cforge fwiendly relations with Demon Lord Leon\u201d right?\u300d[1]</p><br/><p>Does she really understand? For some reason, I have a budding suspicion otherwise.</p><br/><p>Well, any degree of friendship I would happily accept, but a hostile relationship is certainly undesirable.</p><br/><p>We came here to negotiate, and yet you beat the other party\u2019s comrade black and blue, what were you thinking. No, you probably weren\u2019t thinking of anything.</p><br/><p>Choosing Shion as an escort was a failure on my part.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think it was the wrong choice leaving the competent Diablo behind in the Ingrasia kingdom, but that left me with no choice but to bring Shion.</p><br/><p>I think I lucked out considering the fact the other party was still alive.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Leon. My apologies, my subordinate seems to have beaten up your subordinate\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I apologized evasively,</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, that was simply my subordinate acting immaturely. No need to worry.</p><br/><p>However\u2026\u2026that really killed the mood.\u300d</p><br/><p>Yeah, it did.</p><br/><p>I originally intended to serve Leon a single strike, but this really killed that intense mood we\u2019ve built up.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m, not in the mood to fight. Let\u2019s save this for another day.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu. All right then. You and I are even, is that fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, thank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Even, huh\u2026</p><br/><p>It would seem that fellow Leon, doesn\u2019t intend to finish this with just one hit. It was this kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>It seems, he\u2019s the kind of person whose actions don\u2019t always match what he speaks.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Shizu-san too\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>However\u2026\u2026if that\u2019s the case, this concluded without a fight because of Shion\u2019s\u2026 efforts.</p><br/><p>So if this is the birth of our friendship, things have ended pretty well, actually.</p><br/><p>In the end, we were able to exchange useful information, and gave our consent for future cooperation.</p><br/><p>That said, this is only a verbal agreement that needs to be revised and memorialized.</p><br/><p>Even so, I think I will still proceed with Shizu san\u2019s promise.</p><br/><p>Even though I didn\u2019t hit Leon, I think Shizu san doesn\u2019t really wish for me to beat up Leon.</p><br/><p>The invitation was sudden, but I\u2019m glad I accepted.</p><br/><p>After having a heart to heart conversation with Leon, I was able to get a grasp of his personality.</p><br/><p>Achieving one of my purposes, I returned to my own country satisfied.</p><br/><p>For Rimiru, this talk is a day\u2019s work over.</p><br/><p>However, for Leon this isn\u2019t the end.</p><br/><p>Rather, the girl he has been searching for years, Chloe has been found. He began taking action as soon as he could.</p><br/><p>He commanded the Silver Knight Alrose, to gather all the main knights.</p><br/><p>And so, to reclaim Chloe, the demon lord Leon moves out.</p><br/><p>Lying in wait, Kagurazaka Yuuki</p><br/><p>The day when these two forces clash draws near.</p><br/><p>And that battle means that the fight between two bearers of Ultimate skills will occur anew.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>Editor\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>[1] Shion is basically quoting what Rimuru said but in a way that would suggest she has no idea what she\u2019s saying.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

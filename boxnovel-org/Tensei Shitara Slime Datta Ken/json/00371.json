We could at least buy some time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Michelle sent us on this escort mission, and yet we\u2019ve had to rely on Veldora to fight the Super Beasts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Veldora did not care about it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. So, you call that armor a Powered Suit? Yes, it was quite strong. However, Karman, it\u2019s not very fun just being strong, you know? It\u2019s boring. It was amusing enough the first time. But you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against Beretta if you fought him again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That is completely true. They wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. Not even if there are ten of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait-wait-wait. Yes, we did lose to you, but surely it was not by such a margin\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman had to argue back when he heard Beretta\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>However, Veldora agreed with Beretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Karman. Beretta is right. The only reason that Beretta took any damage, in the beginning, was because he did not know the nature of the attack. It is no threat once he knows. Which means that it was not much, to begin with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, it has tremendous power! It is equipped with the Neutrolauncher, the latest weapon from the Empire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora nodded.</p><br/><p>Yes, that was quite powerful.</p><br/><p>Veldora could admit as much.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Karman. That weapon not only has a long gun barrel, but it makes a faint sound when being launched. It would not be difficult to find the target point you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe target point. Beretta would figure it out and distort space in that area in order to alter its course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman was about to say something but swallowed it.</p><br/><p>The sound?</p><br/><p>Calculate from the length of the barrel and predict where it would land?</p><br/><p>He knew the timing, and so was able to deal with the attack?</p><br/><p>There was a lot that he wanted to say but he knew the answer already.</p><br/><p>Beretta was nodding his head as if in agreement, and Ramiris was laughing as if this was all common knowledge.</p><br/><p>(Who are these people! I don\u2019t understand. What kind of features must they have to think this is normal\u2026)</p><br/><p>Karman was tired of being surprised all the time.</p><br/><p>And then Veldora suddenly opened his mouth as if just having an idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cKarman. Why don\u2019t you just have the children design you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s very simple. You can take that Powered Suit or whatever it\u2019s called, and have the children create weapons to attach to it. We retrieved the machines that Beretta broke, so perhaps we can fix them if we have the right parts?\u201d</p><br/><p>What nonsense\u2014Karman thought. But the children were very happy at this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of walking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to rest for a while!\u201d</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t even been half a day since the barbecue, but that was their reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa-wait, Mister Veldora! I didn\u2019t say anything because the children were so enthusiastic, but I don\u2019t think you should expect much from\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Zaza disagreed, but Veldora wasn\u2019t bothered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that I shouldn\u2019t expect much, Zaza. But I am quite serious! Besides, this thing about the Powered Suits is just a side-project. I was really thinking about acquiring a vehicle of some sort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there was a broken vehicle, Beretta would be able to repair it. Then we could travel faster, no? It will be six days soon. If we do not arrive at this destination soon, we will miss the appointed time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTime? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris and Beretta knew.</p><br/><p>It was almost 1 week.</p><br/><p>In other words, it meant the day that Rimuru returned was approaching, and they needed to hurry up and return to their own world in order to destroy all of the evidence.</p><br/><p>They would pretend that nothing had happened and wait before coming back to this world again.</p><br/><p>Now that they had read the information of this world, it would be possible to connect the Different Gate to this dimension once again.</p><br/><p>But since he had made a promise to Michelle, Veldora intended on finishing the current mission.</p><br/><p>He wanted to return to his world after they had escorted the people to the new base.</p><br/><p>So with this considered, he decided that it was necessary to increase their speed.</p><br/><p>The worst-case scenario would involve him showing his true form and taking everyone there.</p><br/><p>But he very much wanted to avoid that.</p><br/><p>And so he thought of preparing a vehicle.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what do you think Zaza? Is there such a place where we might find a vehicle and parts to repair it with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza thought about it.</p><br/><p>He felt that there was no point in asking Veldora as he had no intention of answering.</p><br/><p>It would be wonderful if such a vehicle could be acquired, but Zaza didn\u2019t think that it was likely.</p><br/><p>But on the other hand, he had witnessed Beretta\u2019s ability to repair things, and so there was a part of him that hoped.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, there is an old Empire testing site up ahead. It\u2019s currently a junkyard for old weapons\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go then! We can play with all kinds of\u2014we can prepare!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora said in conclusion.</p><br/><p>Sharma laughed. Rindo shrugged.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

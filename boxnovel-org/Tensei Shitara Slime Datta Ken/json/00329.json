The problem was with Veldora.</p><br/><p>He may attempt to do a wide range, large-scale attack, supposing that Ramiris would use her protection magic.</p><br/><p>That would be incredibly dangerous.</p><br/><p>And so she had to say it now, or either herself or Beretta would get hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Indeed. I have many methods of attack, but most of them cover a wide area. You really can\u2019t make a barrier, Ramiris?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, there is a very weak barrier up right now. But as there is no energy, I am worried about how much it can withstand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were always a weak one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not weak! It\u2019s just that you and Beretta are strangely tough and way too strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKaaa-ahahaha! Well, yes, I am the strongest indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026hmph. I admit that you are amazing, master, but I think there is room for debate as to whether you are the strongest. I am quite impressive myself, when I care to try. If you want, I can show you my forty-seven special moves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? How interesting. Yes, let\u2019s see how useful your power can be!\u201d</p><br/><p>That was Veldora\u2019s reaction to Ramiris\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>It really wasn\u2019t the time for Ramiris to start boasting, but her dislike of losing did her no favors in this instance, and she said something she shouldn\u2019t have.</p><br/><p>In the first place, it didn\u2019t matter how serious she got. Ramiris could never win against Veldora, and there was definitely no room for debate.</p><br/><p>Ramiris herself understood this, and her eyes swam over to Beretta for help.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Ramiris. Your many wonderful skills and secret weapons should be saved for another time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta said in a calm voice.</p><br/><p>Many wonderful skills\u2014he had said, but the truth was that he had never witnessed anything of the sort.</p><br/><p>But Beretta was perceptive enough to leave that out.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, um, yeah. Yes, yes! It would be a waste to show my special attacks in a place like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris was simple.</p><br/><p>And so she quickly switched gears and nodded at Beretta.</p><br/><p>Beretta smiled gently and then turned to Veldora.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Lord Veldora, don\u2019t tease her too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yes. But, Beretta. Aren\u2019t you too soft on Ramiris? I have a feeling that it\u2019s because you spoil her that she becomes so full of herself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just your imagination?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Full of myself? I would never be like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know why, but Beretta is always so cold towards me\u2026 Thought Veldora.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to argue here, because it would be two against one.</p><br/><p>In any case, it was indeed important that they think of safety measures while they were in this unknown world.</p><br/><p>As Veldora agreed with this, he nodded and thought for a while before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Alright. Then I will protect Ramiris. As for these special attacks you have, those can be saved for the very end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cG-got it. Yes, this attack is quite dangerous, so that would be for the best. Okay, so you can protect me then, master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Lord Veldora will guard Lord Ramiris and I will focus on attacking them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Perhaps it\u2019s because I can\u2019t sense any energy, but my \u2018Universal Perception\u2019 is not very sharp. Beretta, don\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>When all was said and done, Veldora was also very soft towards Ramiris.</p><br/><p>And so in cases like this where there was danger, it usually ended with Veldora protecting her.</p><br/><p>And\u2013</p><br/><p>Then the three of them encountered the battle.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>I\u2019m dead! Zaza closed its eyes as the fangs of the Murder Dog approached.</p><br/><p>However\u2013the moment did not arrive. There was only the sickening sound of hard metal scraping against hard metal.</p><br/><p>(Hmm? What had happened?)</p><br/><p>Zaza\u2019s eyes opened cautiously. An unfamiliar figure stood there.</p><br/><p>(Who is that\u2026? The shape was strange\u2026 Was it an Automata or a Machine Doll that was made for combat? Or perhaps\u2026it was also a Cyborg?)</p><br/><p>Of course, it was only Beretta.</p><br/><p>Though, it was no surprise that Zaza wouldn\u2019t be able to tell what it was.</p><br/><p>After all, Beretta was a Chaos Metalloid, which did not exist in this world. But he looked like a doll with spherical joints.</p><br/><p>Of course, the body was formed of Adamantite, and Beretta could freely mold it as he willed. It was like a fluid metal that allowed him to look like any other human.</p><br/><p>However, Zaza knew none of this, and had no idea if Beretta was a friend or an enemy.</p><br/><p>But in the moment, Zaza decided that it was very unlikely that Beretta was hostile.</p><br/><p>After all, it had saved Zaza from the fangs of the Murder Dog.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t know who you are. But thank you. Those things have fangs with a special magnetic current\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza said that much before suddenly realizing something strange.</p><br/><p>Why, the person who stood in front of him had the Murder Dog\u2019s fangs lodged in his arm.</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>The fangs were slowly being pushed out now.</p><br/><p>Its arm was beautiful, like a work of art as the surface rippled like liquid, slowly pushing the fangs out.</p><br/><p>And after it was finished, there wasn\u2019t a single scratch left.</p><br/><p>(Is this real!? I have never seen or heard of such a thing? What laboratory invented it!?)</p><br/><p>Zaza was in shock.</p><br/><p>And it didn\u2019t end there.</p><br/><p>Right in front of the Murder Dogs, Beretta began to calmly talk to Zaza.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Analysis of language patterns complete. It seems that I can use \u2018Thought Transmission\u2019 even without energy, as long as I read your mind waves directly. Also\u2013I believe I detected some unknown electromagnetic wave lengths. It was I who interrupted the fight, now\u2026man or animal. Which one should I aid\u2026 I would prefer it if we could stop the fight for now and talk. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta had been saying things that Zaza could not understand, but suddenly, he started to talk very smoothly in his language.</p><br/><p>There was a strong will behind it, and Zaza felt that the stranger was more human than robot.</p><br/><p>Beretta looked at his own arm to confirm that it was in good order.</p><br/><p>The Murder Dog\u2019s fangs had really gone through Beretta\u2019s armor. But that didn\u2019t mean anything.</p><br/><p>Beretta had transformed the shape in order weaken the impact, molding it the enemy\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>As for the electromagnetic waves\u2026 Beretta wasn\u2019t a precision machine, and so it had no effect at all.</p><br/><p>It was a meaningless attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you! This is no time to be talking like that! That thing is called a Murder Dog, and they are the strongest anti-human murder weapons. You can\u2019t run from its numerous sensors. You have to kill it!!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zaza shouted. Beretta raised a hand for silence and then said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must calm down. For now, I shall guarantee your safety. And in exchange, you can tell me what I want to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll tell you anything. But we have to run away\u2013what!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Zaza had agreed to it, Beretta moved before Zaza could even finish.</p><br/><p>It was so fast that Zaza could not even follow his movements.</p><br/><p>And neither could the Murder Dogs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We were being spied on, so I had to call it trash. But I was really surprised that you were eating something that looked delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>She apologized.</p><br/><p>It was the truth.</p><br/><p>According to the regular reports from the informers, the food that the resistance were eating was supposed to be tragic.</p><br/><p>She had thought it would be the case here, and yet they were eating pancakes.</p><br/><p>So it was no wonder that she was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cKahahaha! Is that not right? Do you want some too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013Well, eating the same thing would be a good shortcut to clearing things up, wouldn\u2019t it? Michelle felt that Veldora had that in mind when offering some to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I shall accept.\u201d</p><br/><p>She received the plate with a little hesitation.</p><br/><p>And then she began to eat. A fork and knife had been brought out seemingly from nowhere, and she used them to cut out a piece and bring it to her mouth.</p><br/><p>The way she ate was like an example of sophistication.</p><br/><p>You wouldn\u2019t imagine someone like her eating something as commonplace as pancakes, and yet she somehow looked good doing it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014It\u2019s delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>She muttered.</p><br/><p>While it was not all that in terms of presentation, the taste felt so nostalgic to her.</p><br/><p>It was not like the refined food she ate in the city. It felt very homemade.</p><br/><p>And through eating the pancakes, the sense of caution the children felt towards Michelle began to fade away.</p><br/><p>She was human just like them.</p><br/><p>Michelle noticed this change and smiled.</p><br/><p>That sealed the deal for them.</p><br/><p>The smile of a beautiful woman is most potent indeed. Even those who had been sure they were going to be killed a moment ago were softened by that smile.</p><br/><p>Everyone was now relieved, as they wholly believed that the battle was now over.</p><br/><p>But then again, there were now some who began to feel anxious in a different way. What was Michelle\u2019s purpose?</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, um\u2026General\u2026Michelle? From what you just said, you have not really come to purge us afterall\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Karman who asked the first question.</p><br/><p>He had been called a traitor, after all. He anxiously scratched his head.</p><br/><p>Then Michelle looked at him with a puzzled expression.</p><br/><p>She chewed, her mouth full of pancake; savoring the taste before swallowing it.</p><br/><p>It was a childish gesture that did not match such icy beauty.</p><br/><p>She smiled with satisfaction and then glanced at Karman.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurge\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>And then she thought about it\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that! Hiragi was making such a fuss about it. You know how he can be like. I don\u2019t think you are a traitor just because you let the resistance escape. After all, what would that make me? I\u2019ve been sending them resources all this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014She dropped this bomb as if it were an afterthought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSending resources!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait-wait-wait! General Michelle!? What do you mean\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Michelle looked at them without concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as I said. In the first place, if I really meant to have you purged, I wouldn\u2019t have come here myself. Quite the opposite, really. I came here so you wouldn\u2019t be killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said all of this in a light manner as if it were below her pancake in terms of importance.</p><br/><p>Those of the resistance were very shocked by this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? But she is the leader of the empire\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 Who have we been fighting all this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Is she trying to trick us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Etcetera.</p><br/><p>No one could believe Michelle. And they did not know how to react.</p><br/><p>And so Sharma stepped forward as if to represent all of the adults.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Sharma, leader of this department. General Michelle, I have a question, if you do not mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Ask me anything you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michelle replied casually.</p><br/><p>She had no intention of hiding anything at this point.</p><br/><p>Of course, being believed was a different matter\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then. The first question\u2026 Is it true that you have been sending us resources up until now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true. I have always felt that we should help each other, as we are the same species. However, the reality is that this is quite difficult. A city was destroyed through a revolt. It will be quite a feat to change the minds of those who live in the city now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait. Then why do you send us supplies? As protector of the city, are we not your enemies!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt cannot be helped that you would think like that. However, I think it is horribly twisted that we must see each other as enemies when our number as a species has fallen so low. Still, we cannot take in every refugee either. What I can offer now is a place to live and hide. Also a small supply of food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words\u2026 You could not take us in, but you wouldn\u2019t abandon us either? Why could you not tell us that\u2026? Then maybe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All of this fighting would not have happened\u2014Sharma was about to say this, but she was interrupted.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

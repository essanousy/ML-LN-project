Expectations that Became True</p><br/><p>On that day, I had finished the improvement of the surveillance magic, and proceeded to test it.</p><br/><p>My current location is at the Tactical Class Military Operated Battle Command Post\u2015\u2015 Aka, the Control Room.</p><br/><p>Going with the flow of things I decided to give it a cool name, but now it\u2019s a little too long and I\u2019m regretting it.</p><br/><p>To be frank, only a few people knew its original name since everyone simply calls it \u201cControl Room\u201d.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s newly established next to Veldora private quarters in the 100th floor of the dungeon, it\u2019s made possible to come in and out to this place from Tempest\u2019s Strategy Conference Hall.</p><br/><p>The Important base was fundamentally established inside the dungeon.</p><br/><p>The results were excellent.</p><br/><p>Several large screens that were used during the tournament were set in this room, each of them displayed a scene from different places.</p><br/><p>The various areas within Jura Great Forest, and the trade route with the Dwarf Kingdom. I\u2019m now able to observe various important points one by one.</p><br/><p>Even the state of the sea routes and the Qanat mountain ranges can be displayed without any problem.</p><br/><p>The concept is simple.</p><br/><p>Utilizing the \u3008Physics Magic\u3009\u201dMeggido (God\u2019s Wrath)\u201d which I created, lens-shaped water drops which were handled by the spirit.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s excellent as I can use it with low cost.</p><br/><p>The images enlarged by the large lens are reflected onto a mirror to be relayed to a similar mirror deployed near the Stratopause and the images will be transferred to this place.</p><br/><p>(Note:  mean Stratopause, the boundary between Mesosphere and Stratosphere)</p><br/><p>At the same time, the transmission of images is directly dealt with via \u300eSpatial Control\u300f, leaving no moment of gap due to instantaneous transfer of data.</p><br/><p>The images projected on the screen had HD quality after being processed by Wisdom King Raphael.</p><br/><p>There\u2019re two projections, in case one get destroyed or is being deceived.</p><br/><p>Now then, there\u2019s another merit from the completion of this surveillance system.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m able to use \u201cMegiddo (God\u2019s Wrath)\u201d while being inside this Control Room.</p><br/><p>I tested it by shooting it at Gobuta\u2019s feet who was training at the square, but I didn\u2019t think I would actually succeed.</p><br/><p>The Gobuta\u2019 face who jumped up in surprise was unforgettable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fool! It\u2019s because you let your guard down!!\u201d</p><br/><p>So I preached him instead, conversely though I thought that Gobuta wasn\u2019t so bad.</p><br/><p>In addition, the performance of \u201d Megiddo (God\u2019s Wrath)\u201d has improved.</p><br/><p>Originally, it was optimized by\u300eGreat Sage\u300f, but the current Wisdom King Raphael didn\u2019t seem to agree to it\u2026</p><br/><p>It developed it more meticulously and had developed a system of 24-hour satellites that would float in the sky.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s usable even at night.</p><br/><p>With my magic essence as the fuel, there\u2019s now a great spirit class geostationary satellite permanently hovering near the Stratopause.</p><br/><p>Once it runs out, I would simply need to supplement it.</p><br/><p>In addition, it\u2019s position that unrelated to day and night make it could convergence direct sunlight, so it\u2019s possible for it to reflect and radiate energy anytime.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped that energy loss would occur, but still the power of the light ray was more powerful than before and can be used at night.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s natural, but there\u2019s also a bit of energy loss even during the day.</p><br/><p>As the amount of light it converged increases, so too does the amount of heat.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s now even possible to exert powers on par with a heat ray gun.</p><br/><p>I might even be able to completely annihilate the human army without moving a step.</p><br/><p>I had such impressions as I\u2019ve been carrying out the magic modification.</p><br/><p>Well then, with the images of various areas displayed onto the large screen, the experiment was a success.</p><br/><p>When I came back to the office after I confirmed the result, Shuna arrived and told me there was a guest.</p><br/><p>From what I can see, there\u2019re quite a lot of them.</p><br/><p>Oh well, you could say that most of my work involve interacting with guests.</p><br/><p>And the rest are developing magic and coming up with items that looks interesting, oh and assigning the right man for the right job.</p><br/><p>Playing is also part of my work.</p><br/><p>With this feeling, I\u2019ve faced my guest seriously.</p><br/><p>I was guided by Shuna to the reception room, inside the room were four individuals waiting with nervous looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>It was a familiar trio, and an old man I\u2019ve seen for the first time.</p><br/><p>The trio was Shinjii and co who played an active role in the previous capturing of the dungeon before.</p><br/><p>First of all, we greet each other, and then I hear their circumstances.</p><br/><p>As expected, under secret order from the empire, they seemed to be sent in order to collect information for the campaign.</p><br/><p>They formally introduced their name, and started explaining their internal conditions</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve consented that this was an order from Yuuki. I thought it would have been him.</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, our dungeon was more difficult than what Yuuki had anticipated.</p><br/><p>Or rather, it was also harder than what I anticipated. This really isn\u2019t something people can simply laugh off.</p><br/><p>If you think normally, you will not think about such a growth\u2015\u2015 or rather that evolution\u2015\u2015 I think it\u2019s an inevitable thing.</p><br/><p>Well that\u2019s all good. Let\u2019s forget about it.</p><br/><p>Well, afterwards they seemed to have reported this to Yuuki, but for some reason it has leaked out to the leaders of the other corps.</p><br/><p>They were caught and seems to have been subjected to interrogation.</p><br/><p>They were doused with drug to make them submit, and in the end a bomb appeared to be planted into their hearts.</p><br/><p>At that time, Shinji\u2019s teacher, who was also the imperial court magician Gadra-roushi\u2015\u2015who seemed to be the old man that came along with them\u2015\u2015rescued them, and escaped to this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, are you guys all right with that bomb?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it has already been removed. We bought a new bracelet, and detonated it in the dungeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shinji replied with a nonchalant face.</p><br/><p>It seemed the bomb was set to detonate itself if it was removed via surgery, it\u2019s seem to be a clich\u00e9 bomb so it looks like they didn\u2019t think up another good plan.</p><br/><p>Anyway, as soon as they were rescued from the jail by Gadra-roushi, they came to this side with Shinji\u2019 Transfer Magic.</p><br/><p>They went to the labyrinth at once, then blew up the bomb inside the labyrinth before the empire side realized their escape and detonates the bomb.</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 certainly they would revives even if they died inside the dungeon, but that certainly was a drastic act.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you consider that it might affected the traps or monster battles inside the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>So after I inquiry him, his face became pale and he was at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>Apparently, they were panicked and didn\u2019t think to that extent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Shinji\u2026\u2026. Oi! Don\u2019t tell me, that you didn\u2019t think about that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>So Mark retort,</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, hahaha. I had thought about that, of course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shinji answered whilst avoiding Mark\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>Oh well, at that time Shinji had insisted that he going to treat it later with his abilities, but this couldn\u2019t be retorted as Shinji had tried it first.</p><br/><p>After that, Gadra said that it would be better off to not in believe Yuuki, and if that was the case they should defect.</p><br/><p>I then pay more attention to Gadra-roushi for the first time.</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t look too showy, but he worn a high quality like magic clothes, he is a sharp-eyed old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, that Gadra-san, why you come here together with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>To my question,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m a reincarnator.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gadra-san suddenly brought up a shocking revelation.</p><br/><p>The trio also surprised, as they stared intently at Gadra-roushi.</p><br/><p>According to what he said, he seemed to reincarnated many times in order to master the grand magic.</p><br/><p>Then, he also participated in the previous Veldora subjugation war, and was splendidly killed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, it was the right choice for me to finished the reincarnation ritual beforehand.</p><br/><p>I wanted to witness it with my own eyes. The highest pinnacle of monster brought about by nature\u201d</p><br/><p>There were only 4 \u201cDragon Kind\u201d that borne unto this world.</p><br/><p>They were the apex of monsters, the strongest being of this world.</p><br/><p>And then, as this was said from his actual fighting experience, he didn\u2019t think the empire would triumph over Veldora, so he said this to me.</p><br/><p>And the Demon Lord that become a sworn friend with that Veldora, aka me, had raised his interest\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI, don\u2019t feel any particular obligation to the empire.</p><br/><p>The corps that I had brought up with great care has been taken away, now I have no more attachments to it.</p><br/><p>Besides, that Adalman resides in the dungeon of this country, or so I heard from my disciple\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wow, it seems that Gadra-roushi was Adalman\u2019s friend from several thousand years ago.</p><br/><p>At that time, in the west \u2015\u2015near the our side of the Jura Great Forest\u2015\u2015was a small country, secret magic research seemed to be conducted in that country.</p><br/><p>In a few brief words, he would read treasured books of each royal palace and build up his knowledge whenever he reincarnated.</p><br/><p>It seems he was a born egotist and he asserted that he have no relation to things like loyalty.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s quite the old man.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll keep the fact I actually respect him quite a bit to myself.</p><br/><p>Of course, the details about Ramiris and the dungeon, he has heard it all from Shinji\u2019s tale! So it seems.</p><br/><p>While whistling and pretend that he didn\u2019t know anything, he seemed to have played tricks on Shinji and co to make them talk, but there was no point to that anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe weapon that Shinji brought back, and the \u201cMagic Crystal\u201d was most intriguing.</p><br/><p>Those greedy people started to cry loudly for the war to start.</p><br/><p>When all is said and done, I think there still more 10 years \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I planned to reincarnate before the war starts, but I failed.</p><br/><p>However, the cause of that is the youngster named Yuuki.</p><br/><p>The one that standing out recently, with enough influence to ascend to the top and become the new Corps leader\u2026</p><br/><p>He leaked the information to the other Corps leaders, and obviously had the interest to cause the war.</p><br/><p>Well, that has nothing to do with me anymore.</p><br/><p>Incidentally, I\u2019ve decided to help my pupils because I was planning to escape with haste.\u201d</p><br/><p>So the Gadra-jiisan brazenly declared.</p><br/><p>But, if his words are true, then it\u2019s according to my expectations.</p><br/><p>Yuuki made the fact that high quality \u201cMagic Crystal\u201d and high performance arms can be acquired from the labyrinth to be known.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then, what will happen?\u2019</p><br/><p>I could expect that people who suggest to start the war early would appear from the empire side.</p><br/><p>To be honest, I\u2019m not the patient kind. Over this one year, I\u2019ve been whole-heartedly waiting, and it\u2019s been peeving me off.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s just finish this war, defeat Yuuki and save Chloe.</p><br/><p>Therefore, I want that side to start attacking us, and I will ignored these three.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, there will no reason to overlook them who we known were spies.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, it\u2019s as planned!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shinji was surprised with my declaration, but Gadra-jiisan simply nodded with a smug look on his face.</p><br/><p>He seems to noticed our ulterior motive.</p><br/><p>Of course, Yuuki probably already see through my thought, though he seems to have hopped on the plan and began moving.</p><br/><p>According to what Gadra-jiisan said, the empire seems to have started to prepare for the start of the war.</p><br/><p>I hear that surrender advice will be done once rather than the declaration of war.</p><br/><p>Then I\u2019ll simply follow it if they started the battle, there will be no mercy after that.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, this side also don\u2019t need to cut any corners.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll just finished it in a flash, and uproot the root of evil.</p><br/><p>The three deserters were accepted at my own discretion.</p><br/><p>Gadra-jiisan was given the guest treatment.</p><br/><p>But, this Old man ended up as the new guardian of the 60th floor later, and become a hidden boss besides the Demon Golem though\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>That was a story unrelated to the current moment.</p><br/><p>\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>The conference of the war in the large conference room had ended, and the Emperor was relaxing in his room.</p><br/><p>With a beautiful woman with hair of azure attending by his side.</p><br/><p>Emperor Ludra was facing the beautiful girl at his side,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, the pawns seemed to be all present, Velgurind.</p><br/><p>Do you think your younger brother would come out this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>So he asked her with an intimate tone.</p><br/><p>The Beauty, Velgurind being asked, naturally replied the emperor.</p><br/><p>The reason why he asked her that was because she was one of the \u201cDragon Kind\u201d the strongest being, the \u201cScorching Dragon\u201d Velgurindo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, Ludra. He would come out. Because that child loves festivals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so, that\u2019s right huh. It would be great if our army could defeat him. Otherwise\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time for sure, I want to checkmate Guy and my elder sister Velzado.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFufuu. So you\u2019re aiming at Guy. If you fight against Veldora, then there\u2019ll a chance for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s vexing. Otherwise, I\u2019ll need to deal with that child (Veldora) quickly\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaHaHa.</p><br/><p>However, this time my ability, the special skill of my Ultimate Skill \u300eJustice King Michael\u300f, enabled me to utilize the Armageddon(Army of Angel).</p><br/><p>Guy\u2019 companions seem to increase in power, though they have united yet.</p><br/><p>This time, we have an overwhelming advantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Then, should I execute a plan to bring that child over to this side.</p><br/><p>Once taken down, he can\u2019t be Guy\u2019 piece, do you want to capture him after I weaken him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu, let\u2019s go with that. However, a human\u2019s flesh really is inconvenient.</p><br/><p>Every time I reincarnate, inheriting the soul and ego\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The ability limitation I suffered depends on the timing.</p><br/><p>This time, I\u2019ve waited until I\u2019m at perfect condition</p><br/><p>My army is well prepared, and there\u2019s no limitation on my ability.</p><br/><p>If you can focus Veldora\u2019 Consciousness, my \u201cRuler\u2019s Control\u201d should be able to take control of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then victory is imminent.</p><br/><p>But\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Somehow that child, doesn\u2019t seem to be in his usual condition ever since his seal was removed.</p><br/><p>His rampaging like violent magic essence storms had vanished completely.</p><br/><p>Maybe he isn\u2019t back to his usual self yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it.</p><br/><p>Guy would simply discard weak people, he wouldn\u2019t make them into pawns.</p><br/><p>Despite this, he\u2019s been raising Demon Lords, but he has yet to control them.</p><br/><p>Actually, the newcomer Demon Lord named Rimuru seems to be popular with the other Demon Lords\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>It would be against the rules for Guy if he turn human into his control.</p><br/><p>And it would be against the rules for us to turn demon lord into our pawns, but that\u2019s just fine.</p><br/><p>Before that Demon Lord (Rimuru) grow up, it\u2019s best for us to crush him as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Even so, the Demon Lords gathered in that place at a good timing.</p><br/><p>Rimuru and Ramiris, we can take down two Demon Lords at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>(Note: He referred to Rimuru and Ramiris with , basically treating them as small fries)</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Well, let\u2019s try to rage as flashy as possible.</p><br/><p>Once Veldora\u2019s in our grasp, their role ends.</p><br/><p>You\u2019ll bestow upon them a rain of mercy with your Ultimate Skill \u300eCharity King Raguel\u300f, it might be good if we conquered that town quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s give them some charity after such a long time. Let give them a peaceful death (blessing)!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two spoke for a bit.</p><br/><p>And then, on the next day.</p><br/><p>A large army from the Empire with a size unprecedented in history depart with Monster Country\u2019s Tempest as their destination.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

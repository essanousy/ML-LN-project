At the Banquet</p><br/><p>Clayman felt himself to be triumphant.</p><br/><p>The old generation which looked down on him now looked with utter surprise.</p><br/><p>From only hitting one arrogant brat.</p><br/><p>So when these stubborn geezers would fall prostrate before him, then he could finally create a world for monsters.</p><br/><p>So Clayman thought in his heart of hearts.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 was this fine?</p><br/><p>This question came to mind.</p><br/><p>That honorable person had mentioned not to stand out, but here he was at the center of attention.</p><br/><p>This thought, Clayman quickly dismissed.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s alright. Recommending a subjugation was a matter of persuasive power, after all.</p><br/><p>Besides, by showing Milim as his follower surely he would dissuade them from opposing him.</p><br/><p>What demon lord would oppose the strongest demon lord Milim?</p><br/><p>But is that actually the case?</p><br/><p>Did he go to far? Why is he feeling anxiety?</p><br/><p>Truly, there was no need to hit Milim.</p><br/><p>Moreover, thinking about the Walpurgis Banquet and the possibility of failing to garner the demon lords\u2019 support made him truly uneasy\u2026</p><br/><p>No, wait. Isn\u2019t something off?</p><br/><p>Why were alarm bells going off in Clayman\u2019s head?</p><br/><p>If the current plan failed, the following one would be jeopardized. And that was no good.</p><br/><p>He had to get advice from that honorable person\u2026</p><br/><p>But he was currently forbidden from contacting that person.</p><br/><p>Besides, he still had the trump card called Milim.</p><br/><p>And, thank to his unique skill\u300ePuppeteer\u300fshe was currently completely under his control.</p><br/><p>In front of her overwhelming power even that Karion was eliminated without offering a hint of resistance.</p><br/><p>And after calming his fears thus, a smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, let me thank you all from the bottom of my heart for gathering upon my summons.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s begin my banquet.</p><br/><p>Thus I declare that the Walpurgis Banquet has begun!\u300d</p><br/><p>As per his rights as the one who gathered them, Clayman declared the start of the banquet.</p><br/><p>And so, for the first time in many hundreds of years, begun the banquet attended by every demon lord.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Guy was observing Clayman with a smirk on his face.</p><br/><p>He almost started laughing looking at this joke of a man, and was truly proud of himself for holding it back.</p><br/><p>Clayman is completely misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>Rather, he just doesn\u2019t get it.</p><br/><p>Though they are called the ten great demon lords, that\u2019s a name the humans selfishly decided for them and not one Guy recognizes.</p><br/><p>Whether there are ten or hundred matters little to him.</p><br/><p>But, the Holy Demon Great War 500 years ago left less than ten of them.</p><br/><p>And then, the new demon lords suddenly decided to fight for dominance and decided to keep the number at ten.</p><br/><p>The humans must have been overjoyed to hear that the number of dangerous beings would decrease.</p><br/><p>So this rule is more of an unspoken agreement, if anything.</p><br/><p>Guy is the first demon lord.</p><br/><p>He granted the wish of his powerless summoner and destroyed an enemy nation.</p><br/><p>As payment, he destroyed the summoner\u2019s country.</p><br/><p>And with this, though it was unnecessary, he noticed his awakening as a true demon lord.</p><br/><p>The two Arch Demons he summoned to destroy the first country evolved into Demon Officials after destroying the latter one.</p><br/><p>And, he permitted them to continue serving him.</p><br/><p>There was another being who awakened as a demon lord at the same time as Guy.</p><br/><p>Milim.</p><br/><p>One of the four \u201cdragons\u201d, the first among them, created a child with a human.</p><br/><p>Interestingly enough, most of the \u201cdragon\u2019s\u201d power was taken by this child.</p><br/><p>Thus, the \u201cdragons\u201d declared the making of children a taboo.</p><br/><p>The \u201cdragon\u201d who lost his power took on flesh, and became the founder of the dragon family.</p><br/><p>From then on, the mass of natural holy spirits came to be called the Dragon Race.</p><br/><p>Presently, the many dragons who inhabit the world can trace their roots to this founder</p><br/><p>The \u201cDragon Race\u201d, Star King Dragon Veldanava.</p><br/><p>That dragon reincarnated as his daughter\u2019s pet dragon and was killed by some country.</p><br/><p>Thus, these fools came to know the meaning of imperial wrath.</p><br/><p>In her anger, Milim destroyed the country.</p><br/><p>And awakened as a true demon lord.</p><br/><p>Unconscious, she fought with Guy.</p><br/><p>That battle continued for seven days and seven nights, transforming the bountiful lands in the west into a wasteland.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the battle concluded.</p><br/><p>Milim regained her consciousness and the battle ended.</p><br/><p>The one who returned her sanity was none other than Ramiris.</p><br/><p>In the process, the ruler of spirits Ramiris absorbed the evil magic of demons and the powerful aura of dragons and began to change.</p><br/><p>But, she was able to stop Milim\u2019s rampage.</p><br/><p>And the three settled this dispute.</p><br/><p>These three were the first demon lords.</p><br/><p>The decided that each of the three would be different than the other two.</p><br/><p>One would pursue the ultimate power.</p><br/><p>One would live as one pleased.</p><br/><p>One would judge the world.</p><br/><p>And that was fine.</p><br/><p>Because their objectives were different, they could recognize each other.</p><br/><p>Later, the protectors of Heaven\u2019s Gates the Giant, the ancient Vampire, and the being who fell from heaven itself increased their numbers to six.</p><br/><p>They were the second generation.</p><br/><p>Demon Lords inferior to the oldest.</p><br/><p>The Giant, due to holy power ingrained in his body, rejected the Demon Lord Seed.</p><br/><p>But, he had unbelievable power and was an amusing guy.</p><br/><p>Due to the many wars the demon lords started to eliminate the giants and the fairies, he awakened as a true demon lord.</p><br/><p>Even so, he has yet to acquire an Ultimate Skill\u2013that Guy and Milim possess.</p><br/><p>But, he did see the chance for such awakening for the Vampire and the Fallen Angel.</p><br/><p>It was a matter of time. And Guy patiently waited for it.</p><br/><p>And, Clayman.</p><br/><p>That fool thought he could control Milim.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s so impossible that it\u2019s hilarious.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way an insect like Clayman could do something that Guy never managed to do.</p><br/><p>Those who possess an ultimate skill are not affected by lower abilities.</p><br/><p>Every rule of the world is ultimately reduced to this unique level.</p><br/><p>In other words, they will not be affected by any form of magic\u2013highest or not.</p><br/><p>And since ultimate skills do not require an incantation, merely wishing for something can produce results.</p><br/><p>A series of attacks of certain affinity could have an effect, though.</p><br/><p>Spiritual Attacks, however, are completely meaningless.</p><br/><p>A soul weak enough to be affected by such an attack could never acquire an ultimate skill.</p><br/><p>So to counter an ultimate skill you need another ultimate skill.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Clayman can do nothing to Milim.</p><br/><p>So right now, he\u2019s dancing in the palm of her hand.</p><br/><p>What a fool.</p><br/><p>Thus with a smirk, Guy was awaiting the conclusion.</p><br/><p>What a fun banquet this could become, he thought.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Clayman proudly began his explanation.</p><br/><p>So, according to human informants, I have killed Demon Lord Karion.</p><br/><p>Though to me, it\u2019s more of a: who the hell is Karion?!</p><br/><p>I know that he\u2019s something akin to a father to Grucius, but I had never met him.</p><br/><p>Oh and Clayman\u2019s explanation is dragging on forever.</p><br/><p>Though I don\u2019t need to sleep, I feel sleepy. Could this be a spiritual attack?</p><br/><p>In a word\u2026 annoying.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t he cut me some slack here.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm\u2026 can I ask a question?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I asked, he looked over irritated and,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat?\u300d</p><br/><p>He asked.</p><br/><p>\u300cNah, just\u2026 do demon lords fancy these kinds of pointless conversations?</p><br/><p>I mean\u2026 aren\u2019t we more into\u2026 Power Rules and Talk with Our Fists type of thing?\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, provokingly.</p><br/><p>At this line, a silver haired girl began to laugh.</p><br/><p>She had looked at me with anger until now, so was I able to diminish it a bit?</p><br/><p>Oh, and when she laughs, she looks very cute.</p><br/><p>\u300cClayman, it\u2019s as he says.</p><br/><p>Your speech is tiresome. State your point\u300d</p><br/><p>The girl told Clayman.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing these words, Clayman turned red in anger.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s that simple? Or that much of a small fry?</p><br/><p>Though if this is an act, then he\u2019s truly impressive</p><br/><p>\u300cKu\u2026 don\u2019t underestimate me, you lowly slime!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Is there something wrong with me being a slime?</p><br/><p>You know, I came over here not to listen to your shitty speech.</p><br/><p>Oh, and what were you trying to achieve by hitting Milim?</p><br/><p>I put up with it in the beginning of the conference, but isn\u2019t it about time?</p><br/><p>Just say what you want to say; those will be your last words, anyways.\u300d</p><br/><p>His face convulsed upon hearing my words.</p><br/><p>Rather than anger, I saw an ominous black aura float around him.</p><br/><p>As expected of a demon lord. It is intimidating. A tiny bit.</p><br/><p>And at that moment, the doll-like Milim, for a split second, looked as she wanted to fist pump me.</p><br/><p>Nah, I probably just imagined it.</p><br/><p>Seriously, how pitiful. I\u2019ll free you soon, Milim.</p><br/><p>I swore in my heart.</p><br/><p>\u300cKu, everyone. Did you hear that?</p><br/><p>This lowest of all beings acquired the Demon Lord Seed by chance and after becoming a demon lord, behold how haughty he has become.</p><br/><p>Besides, they even began a war with the humans!</p><br/><p>I do not believe we can leave this being as is. I propose we purge him, what are your thoughts about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>He waved his hands flamboyantly, trying to measure the demon lords\u2019 response.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, is taking control of one\u2019s spirit during Walpurgis Banquet permitted?\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, kicking the table into the air.</p><br/><p>The huge round table flew and crashed far behind him.</p><br/><p>Creating an opening in the middle.</p><br/><p>\u300cNay. At this place, overtaking your opponent with words alone is considered just\u300d</p><br/><p>A red haired demon lord \u2013 the most dangerous looking one of them all \u2013 responded.</p><br/><p>Amused, he lightly laughed.</p><br/><p>I glanced at Shion, who immediately launched a barrage of attacks at at Clayman.</p><br/><p>Filling her fists with aura, she landed about thirty hits in a split second.</p><br/><p>And with a truly refreshed face,</p><br/><p>\u300cIs this fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>She asked.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Seriously, girl, shouldn\u2019t you ask that before you hit someone?</p><br/><p>Besides, I only glanced at you for a second!</p><br/><p>True, I did want you to shut Clayman up\u2026</p><br/><p>But I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d beat him up the very next moment.</p><br/><p>Well, what\u2019s done is done.</p><br/><p>Besides, Wisdom King Raphael picked up the effect of some activity in play during his speech.</p><br/><p>I bet he was trying to set things up to his own convenience, but that plan I foiled.</p><br/><p>So when we shut Clayman up a second ago, that was a legitimate case of self-defense.</p><br/><p>So if there\u2019s demon lords who get mad at me and decide to fight me, then nothing can be done about that.</p><br/><p>\u300cY-y-you\u2026 bastard!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The ominous black aura released by Clayman quickly regenerated his wounds.</p><br/><p>This ability far surpassed the one displayed by the Orc Lord.</p><br/><p>Well, that much should be expected from a demon lord.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnforgivable\u2026\u300eMarionette Master\u300f!\u300d</p><br/><p>Clayman cried out taking out five dolls from within his cloak.</p><br/><p>Each doll transformed into a devil and attacked Shion.</p><br/><p>Each a high ranking devil.</p><br/><p>Chances are, that ability allows him to make dolls out of devils whose soul he stole.</p><br/><p>Wisdom King Raphael was able to analyze that skill with just a glance, and so explained.</p><br/><p>But, frankly\u2026 what of it? That\u2019s what I want to say to him.</p><br/><p>As expected, with her herculean strength and her beloved sword, she cut the devils down.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, aren\u2019t you a little skilled! But, it\u2019s no use.</p><br/><p>Marionette Dolls can immediately regenerate and continue to attack!\u300d</p><br/><p>Clayman called out, while beginning his incantation.</p><br/><p>Shion just shrugged in response.</p><br/><p>And, the dolls did not move at all.</p><br/><p>\u300cN-no way\u2026 why aren\u2019t they being reborn?\u300d</p><br/><p>Clayman cut the incantation short in a panic.</p><br/><p>I really want to tell him that instead of saying such pointless things, he should have continued his chant.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeeaaah. It\u2019s a pain, so I\u2019ll tell you.</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s odachi is a soul eater.</p><br/><p>Those dolls, of course, aren\u2019t protected against attacks to their soul.</p><br/><p>So since they were so poorly made, they fell from a single hit\u300d</p><br/><p>I explained as if it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><br/><p>I mean, since he\u2019s become my grub in the end, I\u2019ll teach him whatever he wants to know.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no reason to hide this much either.</p><br/><p>\u300cA sword that hits the soul as well!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not rare, right? The humans have these too?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cR-ridiculous! That\u2019s a treasure sword, isn\u2019t it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. I wouldn\u2019t know. Cause we made it\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s odachi I improved using Hinata\u2019s sword as a reference.</p><br/><p>Though I did remove that foolish seven-hit feature. It eats the soul from a single strike.</p><br/><p>As a result, though it\u2019s not a certain-kill weapon, it does do both physical and spiritual damage.</p><br/><p>So you need to be on your guard as otherwise you\u2019ll be devoured.</p><br/><p>And if you don\u2019t protect yourself against physical attacks, you\u2019ll end up a bloody mess.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh. So this was \u201cHercules\u2019 Edge Revised\u201d huh!\u300d</p><br/><p>Did you yourself not know\u2026</p><br/><p>Haven\u2019t I explained it on our way here? Ah, whatever\u2026 It\u2019s Shion after all.</p><br/><p>At that moment Clayman stood up.</p><br/><p>He desperately completed his incantation and set off his spell.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll add that impudent swords woman to my collection.</p><br/><p>Devour her, Demon Marionette!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>That ominous light attacked not me, but Shion.</p><br/><p>And seeing this,</p><br/><p>\u300cKukukukuku. Be glad, it\u2019s the ultimate incantation that can even control a demon lord!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s shame to have someone like you as a devil, but whatever.</p><br/><p>Surely you are sick of serving a lowly slime?</p><br/><p>After all, for someone who had so much trouble killing a lowly Orc Lord, to die by their subordinate\u2019s hand is a fitting end!</p><br/><p>After you dispose of your master, I\u2019ll make you my pawn\u300d</p><br/><p>He declared.</p><br/><p>Pointless. For a second I did want to say\u300eOh no! I\u2019m doomed!\u300fto get him riled up a bit, but this is too annoying.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2026 is too weak.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s someone who\u2019d be taken out by Hinata in a moment.</p><br/><p>No, rather than weak, maybe I\u2019m just accustomed to seeing Benimaru, Souei, and other department members who are overly strong.</p><br/><p>By magic energy alone, he\u2019s weaker than Shion.</p><br/><p>Besides\u2026 Shion has that skill\u300ePerfect Memory\u300fthat preserves her memories even after death.</p><br/><p>In other words, she can exist as a soul alone.</p><br/><p>So Soul Control Archive abilities are completely ineffective. Moreover, spiritual attack damage is also largely ignored.</p><br/><p>In other words,</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, what kind of attack is this? I don\u2019t feel pain or anything.</p><br/><p>How long are you planning to keep me waiting?\u300d</p><br/><p>I could hear Shion\u2019s slightly irritated voice coming from the darkness.</p><br/><p>Raphael had analyzed the effect and predicted that Shion would be unaffected; seems like he was correct.</p><br/><p>So even though he introduced this as some grand secret technique, this is all it amounted to.</p><br/><p>\u300cT-this cannot be!!!</p><br/><p>A skill that even put Milim\u2013demon lord Milim under my control cannot possibly have no effect on someone like you!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion blew away the aura.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Clayman fell into a state of panic. The match has been decided.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone, will you permit this one to continue her rampage?!</p><br/><p>They are looking down on all the demon lords. We must punish them at once!</p><br/><p>In fact, let\u2019s remember the fate of poor Karion!\u300d</p><br/><p>His eyes bloodshot, he sought support from the other demon lords.</p><br/><p>The moment I entered battle mode, a barrier was erected isolating the room.</p><br/><p>Well, I had expected this much when I kicked the table away.</p><br/><p>But what a troublesome guy he is.</p><br/><p>The moment he realizes he can\u2019t win he runs to get help from others.</p><br/><p>Dagrule and Dino opened their mouths as if to say something.</p><br/><p>They are probably trying to come to my defense. It\u2019s a good thing I spoke to them earlier.</p><br/><p>But at that moment,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, hey. Who said that I kicked the bucket?</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s the first time I\u2019m meeting this monster named Rimuru?\u300d</p><br/><p>A low, elegant voice resounded.</p><br/><p>From one of the subordinates of the winged woman who came in along with Clayman.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a cool mask, so I couldn\u2019t see his face\u2026</p><br/><p>But at that moment the mask fell off and a violent aura gushed forth.</p><br/><p>Haa!!!</p><br/><p>And transforming his clothing, before us appeared the Beast Demon Lord Karion.</p><br/><p>Like my \u201cAnti-demon Mask\u201d, his held back his aura.</p><br/><p>Had I paid attention I could have realized this ahead of time, but since I hadn\u2019t met Karion before, I had no way to know.</p><br/><p>Um, so\u2026 what does this mean?</p><br/><p>\u300cN-no way! Why are you alive!!!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>If that\u2026. You\u2019ve betrayed me! Frey!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>His eyes bloodshot, he shot the accusation at the winged woman.</p><br/><p>By the looks of it, rather than betraying him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAra? Since when had I become your ally?\u300d</p><br/><p>She nonchalantly replied.</p><br/><p>Women are scary.</p><br/><p>\u300cD-d-don\u2019t screw with me! You wretch!!!</p><br/><p>Whatever. I got it. No forgiveness for any of you\u300d</p><br/><p>Clayman quickly regained his composure.</p><br/><p>Does he have a trick up his sleeve?</p><br/><p>With a smirk on his face, Clayman loudly declared</p><br/><p>\u300cMilim, slaughter everyone here!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The air tensed in the room, and everyone\u2019s expressions froze.</p><br/><p>Most, like I, were in the middle of calmly preparing ourselves.</p><br/><p>And we all looked at Milim.</p><br/><p>His trump card.</p><br/><p>I was sure Milim was being controlled.</p><br/><p>And I guess she was\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, this is certainly bad. Clayman is an insect at most, but Milim is dangerous.</p><br/><p>Even now, my chances are not so good. Even so, I want to save her.</p><br/><p>No, I will save her!</p><br/><p>I will release\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment I thought so,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy should I do such a thing? Rimuru is a friend you now?\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim replied without a care.</p><br/><p>Ummm, eh? What???</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t the only one confused.</p><br/><p>The demon lords as well had a face that said: \u201cEh? But she just took a hit from him a second ago!\u201d</p><br/><p>What does this mean?</p><br/><p>Without any care for our confusion,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Frey! Did you take care of that thing for me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, yes, this, right?</p><br/><p>But seriously\u2026 trying to fist pump people, grinning like an idiot\u2026</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t act at all. Well, I guess I should praise you for allowing those attacks.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat was natural. Rimuru getting angry for my sake made me really happy.</p><br/><p>And if we weakened Clayman\u2019s resolve a bit more, the truth would come out by itself!\u300d</p><br/><p>While thus talking, Frey took something out from her bag and handed it to Milim.</p><br/><p>The dragon knuckles that I gifted her.</p><br/><p>Happily taking the knuckles, she immediately put them on. And a wide smile appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>\u300cI had wanted to get a bit angrier, but this is fine. I hope you\u2019ve said your prayers, Clayman!\u300d</p><br/><p>She said, shooting a glance at him.</p><br/><p>So, in other words\u2026 they performed this script?</p><br/><p>The other demon lords have by now started to catch up to the event.</p><br/><p>As I thought.</p><br/><p>I thought.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s just how it is.</p><br/><p>I thought I heard a voice say within me.</p><br/><p>But,</p><br/><p>\u300cW-wait a second, Milim. Y-you weren\u2019t being controlled by him?</p><br/><p>So you tortured me on a whim?</p><br/><p>And you blew away that holy mountain on your own free will?\u300d</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Karion asked, with a vein popping on his head.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Don\u2019t sweat the small details!</p><br/><p>Come on, Clayman has been cornered. Let\u2019s have him spill the beans!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat small details!

It seems like it\u2019s my turn at last!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even considering that he was isolated from the physical world while in the \u2018Imaginary Space\u2019, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that he wasn\u2019t reading the atmosphere at all.</p><br/><p>And the price for that was quite high.</p><br/><p>And so him being punished by his elder sisters couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>However, his elder sisters\u2013Velzado and Velgrynd\u2019s interest soon went towards Velgaia, the new true dragon, who was riding on Milim\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Although it can be said that he was saved thanks to that, it is also true that that was also the \u2018cause behind his sisters leaving him\u2019\u2013which he definitely deserved.</p><br/><p>\u201cGgnuuu\u2026 that Gaia\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, it was my job to console Veldora, who was feeling jealous of his brother (?). Just between us, that was extremely bothersome.</p><br/><p>Well, when all\u2019s said and done, Veldora is still the same as ever.</p><br/><p>Our relationship of him causing problem somewhere and me doing something about it will probably continue here on after as well.</p><br/><p>I kinda felt pleasant thinking that but it will be a secret from Veldora.</p><br/><p>I mean, obviously, right?</p><br/><p>If I were to say that out loud, I can picture him getting carried away clear as day.</p><br/><p>As our relation won\u2019t change, not now or later, I don\u2019t even need to say it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Speaking of his elder sisters, one of them\u2013Velgrynd, has already set out on a journey.</p><br/><p>She probably went to search for Rudra\u2019s reincarnate.</p><br/><p>\u201cRimuru, you do have some idea about it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! N-no. I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>She did ask me once out of the blue before leaving but I ignored it splendidly.</p><br/><p>I definitely did not stutter because I was scared of what she did to Veldora.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that I got a bit nervous since a very impactful, beautiful lady\u2019s face was very close to mine, yes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026 No, really.</p><br/><p>Well, actually, I do have someone questionable in mind.</p><br/><p>But, if I were to speak of his name here, it would feel like I yielded to Velgrynd here.</p><br/><p>Besides, I would also feel bad about selling him out.</p><br/><p>I think he deserves to experience some peace now that we have regained stability after so long.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026 However, despite my concerns for him, it seems he was quite easily found by Velgrynd.</p><br/><p>My condolences. I hope he is blessed with good fortune in his path.</p><br/><p>\u2014After that, stories of a hero with a talking sword in hand, accompanied by a dragon and demon spread throughout the world; but that\u2019s none of my concern.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Velzado returned to the Northern Continent together with Guy.</p><br/><p>Seems like she will build up a paradise for demons there in the extreme cold where no human can interfere.</p><br/><p>Their castle was completely destroyed but she said they will reproduce it with Guy\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it seems like he acquired the Ultimate Skill: Abyss God Nodens by using the experience of the final fight.</p><br/><p>And this ability even adopted Gaia\u2019s All Creation Manifestation, truly an all-purpose ability.</p><br/><p>Seems like he attempted the upgrade while trying to deal with Rudra\u2019s rampaging energy.</p><br/><p>Although he seemed a bit dissatisfied because he couldn\u2019t test the ability he went so far to acquire as I appeared right on time.</p><br/><p>It also didn\u2019t seem like he had any intention of hiding it since he came telling me about it himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on fighting with you. I am the type who doesn\u2019t take fights they can\u2019t win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was what he said at that time.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if that is his true feelings or not but I don\u2019t want to fight with Guy either, so that\u2019s fine with me.</p><br/><p>At the very least, I felt like Guy as he is now could have fought Yuuki on an even field.</p><br/><p>Well, I won\u2019t lose to him as I am now but I don\u2019t fancy getting hurt due to being prideful like that.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no reason nor meaning in fighting him, so it\u2019s best if we can get along.</p><br/><p>Although I do say that, Guy and I fought a few times after that but I shall talk about that at a later opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>The celestial world was decided to be Milim\u2019s territory.</p><br/><p>With Gaia\u2019s All Creation Manifestation, we recreated the parts of the castle and the gate.</p><br/><p>The residents of Milim\u2019s previous demon lord territory were migrating successively.</p><br/><p>The harpies led by Frey and the Lycanthropes.</p><br/><p>And the celestial demons[1], who are now obeying Dino.</p><br/><p>These celestial demons are a new race born from incarnated angels transforming \u2014 does that make sense?</p><br/><p>In the first place, the angels who fall into deprivation and turn into demons are called Harpy or Tengu so this can\u2019t be taken as a rule.</p><br/><p>Even Dino is of a race called \u2018Fallen\u2019, as he fell into deprivation.</p><br/><p>Well, in reality, these celestial demons don\u2019t really have a physical body so they can\u2019t live outside the celestial world though. As such, celestial demons, harpies and lycanthropes are Milim\u2019s main forces.</p><br/><p>We have decided on secretly having cultural interexchange between Tempest and them and have settled on testing new technology in the celestial world.</p><br/><p>And it was clear that the advancements of science would be clearly different from my previous world as magicules exist here, which can be directly converted into energy.</p><br/><p>We will be doing the developments in the labyrinth like always but the celestial world will be adopting the technology first.</p><br/><p>And then, by using the data we acquire there to complete it, we will apply it in Tempest.</p><br/><p>And naturally, the tech built with physics will be sent directly to Dwargon and the ones built with magic to Sarion.</p><br/><p>Like this, while maintaining each of the country\u2019s uniqueness, we will be providing them with the latest technology.</p><br/><p>And of course, without saying, the profit from the technology would be entering my pocket.</p><br/><p>And to speak of the Milim in question, well, she is still the same\u2026 stealthily going behind Frey\u2019s back to come play from time to time.</p><br/><p>Well, I have also been playin\u2013I mean, taking a breather, together so I can\u2019t really complain.</p><br/><p>Dino also comes along as Milim\u2019s guard but there\u2019s no mistake that his aim is to slack off and have snacks.</p><br/><p>After all, after playing/slacking off for a long time, when Frey appears, both Milim and Dino\u2019s face turns pale.</p><br/><p>It really feels like the master and servant both have no urge to work but\u2026 will the celestial world really be alright?</p><br/><p>Well, something will work out as long as Frey\u2019s there.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Speaking of Milim, this reminds me: there\u2019s one problem.</p><br/><p>Recently, Shuna, Shion and Milim have been intensely competing against each other in my absence.</p><br/><p>From Souei\u2019s oblique report, it seems like they are having a holy battle for the place of my legal wife.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that?\u2013I felt my head aching even thinking about it.</p><br/><p>In the first place, I don\u2019t have my \u2018son\u2019 and neither a lifespan so it\u2019s completely unnecessary to marry.</p><br/><p>Chloe was like \u2018Sensei is (only my) sensei!\u2019 and came hugging me so that was genuinely cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair! Rimuru is my best friend, so I should be the one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just you being deceived! If you are going to say that, then I am Rimuru-sama\u2019s only secretary!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChloe\u2014turns out to be quite the tactician\u2026 I need to be more careful about her than the muscle-headed Milim-sama or Shion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three rushed in while I was having tea with Chloe.</p><br/><p>And like always, the noisy time started.</p><br/><p>This also became regular day by day so I better come up with a solution soon.</p><br/><p>Besides, if I were to decide on a legal wife, would they come asking to be my concubines next?</p><br/><p>No, no, let\u2019s stop thinking about that.</p><br/><p>That would be too bothersome.</p><br/><p>[Fufufu, master\u2019s partner (legal wife) is me so\u2014]</p><br/><p>I feel like I just heard something but it\u2019s probably better to not think too deeply about that either. And like always, I decided to postpone the problem.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Tempest also underwent a big transformation.</p><br/><p>After tending to the hobgoblins under Rigurdo\u2019s commands, we started reconstructing the city with Benimaru as the head.</p><br/><p>With the help of Gerudo\u2019s craftsmen, the city was reconstructed in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Ramiris was easily handling the reestablishment of the satellite city.</p><br/><p>The adventurers also helped out and the empire\u2019s soldiers were also mobilized.</p><br/><p>What about their salary? That\u2019s not for me to worry about.</p><br/><p>Myourmiles-kun came clinging onto me saying \u2018Rimuru-sama~~~\u2019 in a crying voice so I instantly cheered him up with \u2018Good luck! I know you can do it!\u2019\u2013so it should be fine.</p><br/><p>It seems like he was also being consoled by Rigurdo, so it\u2019s great that they are getting along well.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his hard work, Tempest was reborn into an unprecedented, unique, super futuristic city.</p><br/><p>I restrained myself and just gave ideas but Gerudo made it all happen.</p><br/><p>He implemented the new technology from his research ungrudgingly.</p><br/><p>There are also some which were used without testing in the celestial world.</p><br/><p>While leaving the hot spring town in the side, the city of Tempest magnificently upgraded into a futuristic city.</p><br/><p>And a multi-layered defense barrier was put up with the help of a huge scale magic circle.</p><br/><p>The teleportation devices connected places within the city, making it easier to channel distribution.</p><br/><p>The teleportation devices were set up in every division, so travelling and transport was very smooth.</p><br/><p>The skyscrapers were set in a very functional way that the sunlight shone directly on the city\u2019s center.</p><br/><p>Surrounding that, the residents\u2019 living space spread out in harmony with the forest.</p><br/><p>Even a comfort zone was built, completing the mystical city.</p><br/><p>By using magic and science in harmony, we were able to realise an extremely high level of efficiency way, way ahead of time.</p><br/><p>And this probably goes without saying but the jobs for cultural exchange with other countries were also piled up.</p><br/><p>The making of transit gates were pressing but there was also the need to finish the railroad system to use it together.</p><br/><p>Thinking of it like that, it was decided to use the magic train as the transportation network between the cities.</p><br/><p>By implementing various different kinds of magic techniques, the train was now able to travel at a speed of 300 km/h without impacting the surrounding or making noise.</p><br/><p>The railroad tracks were made by the empire soldiers.</p><br/><p>The western countries, Dwarf kingdom, Sorcerer\u2019s Dynasty Sarion and the previous demon lords\u2019 territory.</p><br/><p>The transportation network between Tempest and the surrounding countries was advancing at a quick pace.</p><br/><p>Between the Dwarf kingdom and The Empire, the dwarves were also constructing a rail.</p><br/><p>By the way, the previous demon lords\u2019 territory after Milim\u2019s group left was still untouched.</p><br/><p>It was a rich land, abundant with resources.</p><br/><p>I am thinking of discussing with the kings of the surrounding countries on how to use it later on.</p><br/><p>All these development will probably be completed in ten or so years as state projects.</p><br/><p>No one objected to it.</p><br/><p>When I suggested the construction under my name, all of the countries happily accepted.</p><br/><p>As expected of the Great Demon Lord\u2019s name who saved the world, it sure gives off a sense of sophistication.</p><br/><p>It was also expected that all these new technology will lead to many people getting unemployed. This construction will give all these people jobs, so it\u2019s not all bad.</p><br/><p>Rather, they must have realized that this transportation network will lead to further development.</p><br/><p>From now on, people who have information will be controlling everything.</p><br/><p>I decided to restrain myself and there was no one to obstruct either.</p><br/><p>If so, then the deciding factor will be how fast the other countries take in Tempest\u2019s new technology.</p><br/><p>The economic war was so intense now that directly going to war seems stupid at best.</p><br/><p>And the factors supporting that are information and the citizen\u2019s hard work.</p><br/><p>If everyone in a country does not work hard, the country\u2019s living standards will remain low and the quality difference will keep on increasing\u2014is what Ciel-san\u2019s future prediction chart says.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, then am I not trying to control the world with economic and technological strength\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>No, no, I am probably thinking too much.</p><br/><p>I did say that I would restrain myself but I didn\u2019t say anything about not taking over the world.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s fine as long as we all work hard and make it a better world together.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>I established two more new cities in Jura Forest.</p><br/><p>At present, they are under praiseworthy construction.</p><br/><p>One for the high orcs, a mining city. And the other for the lizardman, a city on water.</p><br/><p>High quality minerals will be produced from the mining city.</p><br/><p>And these produced goods will be transported to the central city of Tempest.</p><br/><p>The water city will be floating on the Cis lake and I also plan on building a station for airships there.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also one at Tempest but not many can be stationed at once.</p><br/><p>In that sense, as Cis lake is huge, it can station a lot.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo is ruling as the prime minister in Tempest.</p><br/><p>For the mining city, it will be Gerudo, and Gabil for the watercity. The kings of each tribe will be governing their cities.</p><br/><p>I am a little worried on that part about Gabil but he is also maturing as he has made up with Abil.</p><br/><p>He isn\u2019t the Gabil he used to be so there shouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>And like this, a system which doesn\u2019t require me to give orders was slowly being constructed.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Even otherworlders, who are being discovered at various points of the world, are now being protected safely.</p><br/><p>The ones who decide on living in this world will be sent to a particular academy in Ingracia kingdom and will gain general knowledge about this world and learn fighting techniques and other things.</p><br/><p>After graduating, they can work at any important organisation in any country.</p><br/><p>If they choose to return, they will be sent to Mai\u2019s \u2018Otherworld Network Research Division\u2019 where they will help her research.</p><br/><p>Well, actually, I could send them back to their world by myself.</p><br/><p>However, it somewhat felt wrong to be sending everyone of them to their home countries one by one, doing the philanthropic work.</p><br/><p>Besides, now that I have confirmed that there are several different worlds, I can\u2019t lump them altogether as \u2018otherworlders\u2019.</p><br/><p>There will be otherworlders who are not from the world I am from.</p><br/><p>I will provide them with information. And so, they will have to work hard themselves to develop a teleportation magic to cross dimensions\u2013a dimension navigation method.</p><br/><p>For that, they will have a strong driving force and a strong will.</p><br/><p>Although, I am considering secretly sending them off if they fail even after trying for a few years\u2026 But I have a feeling that they can probably do it so there will not be a need for that.</p><br/><p>Their hard work will bear fruit and the dimension navigation method will be developed.</p><br/><p>And then\u2013</p><br/><p>A brand new story will start with inter-dimensional exchange.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Ramiris was upset.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter all the trouble I went through to do some glorious work! Now I will have to be a child for a few thousand years again!\u201d</p><br/><p>She came complaining to me.</p><br/><p>My honest thought on that is \u2013\u2019no point complaining to me about it\u2019.</p><br/><p>Even Trainee-san and the others were sad because they couldn\u2019t see Ramiris\u2019 true form.</p><br/><p>But, really, just for a few years after waiting a few thousand? It\u2019s weird that she can only be in that form for such a short period of time.</p><br/><p>It seems she had awakened forcibly this time so she will have to start anew again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine, isn\u2019t it? Childs can play whenever they want and you won\u2019t be given unpleasant work like Milim, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that is true. My work will be my beloved research and that is the best but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? In the first place, there isn\u2019t anything you would have wanted to do after becoming an adult, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm, now that you mention it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, after such a conversation, she went back to her normal cheerful attitude.</p><br/><p>It seems like she just wanted to show her adult form to me and so Ramiris was easy to calm down.</p><br/><p>And now, about the labyrinth, well, the difficulty level had gone too far up.</p><br/><p>No matter how I think of it, no human can ever conquer it.</p><br/><p>Even with cutting edge battle weapons or magic tools, it will probably be difficult for them.</p><br/><p>So much that even the lower levels were now a place to test the newest weapons.</p><br/><p>And as such, I made it so that they can get the passport to the elves\u2019 city if they cross the 50th floor.</p><br/><p>After all, if I don\u2019t do that, the high quality relaxing area will go to waste.</p><br/><p>Well, the royalties of each country and we could use the VIP institution but just that feels too lonely.</p><br/><p>Putting that aside, the labyrinth force which has Ramiris and Zegion as its head, just kept getting stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>And so, it was quite a busy year.</p><br/><p>Even thinking back on it, it was a very rich time.</p><br/><p>But, now that everything has settled down a bit, I am thinking of taking care of one of my regrets.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Skyscrapers stood in a line.</p><br/><p>The surrounding was filled with hustle and bustle, shrieks and angry roars.</p><br/><p>A patrol car\u2019s siren could be heard afar.</p><br/><p>It was a scenery so nostalgic it made me feel a bit dizzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenpai, senpai?! Please hold it together, senpai\u2014!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A youngster who was crying with a \u2018nice guy\u2019 in his arms and a young woman looking at them in grief.</p><br/><p>It was Tamura and Sawatari-san.</p><br/><p>These guys, they really haven\u2019t changed, huh?\u2014Well, I guess that is pretty obvious.</p><br/><p>I walked up to Tamura and pat his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cMove aside, Tamura.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-?! Who\u2026 are you\u2026? How do you know my name\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, now. Don\u2019t sweat the details.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned around to complain but lost his words seeing my beautiful face\u2013that\u2019s about it.</p><br/><p>\u2018You will make Sawatari-san mad, you know?\u2013is what I thought of saying but decided not to instead.</p><br/><p>I pushed Tamura aside and held the jewel I brought out over the nice guy\u2019s dead body.</p><br/><p>The dead body and jewel seems to have fused properly so all that\u2019s left is to send it to my \u2018Multiple Parallel Existence\u2019.</p><br/><p>Ah, I almost forgot.</p><br/><p>Human bodies feel pain so I should properly heal it.</p><br/><p>Thinking that, I brought out a healing potion and poured it on to the dead body.</p><br/><p>Seeing the wounds heal in the blink of an eye, I was satisfied knowing that they work in this world, as well.</p><br/><p>If I hadn\u2019t healed it properly, I would have had to restore it after taking it in and that\u2019s a pain.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a relief the healing potions work.</p><br/><p>With this, the preparations are complete.</p><br/><p>I concentrated my consciousness, and used \u2018Multiple Parallel Existence\u2019 on the jewel.</p><br/><p>[It is a success. It seems like skills can also be activated here without any problem.]</p><br/><p>Hmm, that\u2019s a relief.</p><br/><p>It seems like I succeeded in diving some of my consciousness to the nice guy\u2013or in other words, my otherworld\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Now then, before I\u2014Mikami Satoru, wake up, I should get going.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly did you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Tamura. From now on, properly respect your senpai and don\u2019t think of showing off, alright? Also, I will do something about the PC myself so cancel that request!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Giving a smile to Tamura\u2019s confused and shocked expression, I left the place.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to explain much.</p><br/><p>After all, I\u2013Mikami Satoru\u2013will probably explain the rest.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I woke up.</p><br/><p>On a hospital bed, in this nostalgic world.</p><br/><p>In my accustomed thirty-seven year old body.</p><br/><p>After a bit of checking, I also confirmed my \u2018son\u2019 was also in good health.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s good.</p><br/><p>I thought from the bottom of my heart.</p><br/><p>Although, I was a bit worried if it worked or not.</p><br/><p>Eh, you say that I have never really used it so it\u2019s probably fine? I will kill you, ya bastard!!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s only good manner to have it working anytime.</p><br/><p>Preparations are important.</p><br/><p>Well, leaving that aside.</p><br/><p>The things until now weren\u2019t a dream, right?</p><br/><p>Spare me the pain of seeing all that as a dream for getting stabbed, alright\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>If all that was just a simple afternoon dream, I can\u2019t even laugh\u2026</p><br/><p>However, seeing how peaceful it is, I might have actually believed it was a dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, senpai! You are awake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Tamura, eh? Is this the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The police had come just a while ago but it seems like they returned after the doctor told them you should rest a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPolice\u2026\u2026? Why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease calm down. Senpai, do you remember almost being stabbed by a random attacker? The police had come to get some info on that attacker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see\u2026 Wait, did I not get stabbed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hmm? Was it actually a dream?</p><br/><p>If I wasn\u2019t stabbed and that was all a afternoon dream after I collapsed then\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Well, actually, you might not believe this but\u2026 a mysterious woman\u2013that too not of a model or celebrity level\u2013an extremely beautiful woman\u2013she, she brought you back to life. You might laugh saying I don\u2019t know what I am talking about but it is the truth! As proof, please look at that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tamura answered my doubts.</p><br/><p>And I looked at the wall, where my suit was hanged. There was a small tear in the back and it was covered in red blood.</p><br/><p>Seems like there\u2019s no mistaking that that is my blood.</p><br/><p>That means, that really wasn\u2019t a dream and I\u2013Rimuru\u2013played a prank on myself.</p><br/><p>That bastard\u2013well, even though I say that, it is me but\u2013to do that even against myself\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I thought, you won\u2019t believe me, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I believe you, Tamura. Also, it seems like the police visited for no reason. After all\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that would be something he wouldn\u2019t believe even if I were to tell him.</p><br/><p>The attacker who killed me\u2013I might have forgiven him but Diablo sure wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>By now, the attacker is probably experiencing unlimited torture by Diablo and regretting being born.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way he would believe that, so I tried to dodge the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way Tamura\u2013if I were to tell you that I went to another world after dying, would you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>To my whisper, Tamura\u2019s expression looked bewildered for a moment.</p><br/><p>He probably thought what in the world I was talking about.</p><br/><p>That would be the normal reaction, or so I thought but\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cI would believe you, senpai. I just witnessed something very weird and besides, that woman felt strangely like you, after all. And now when I think about it, I feel like that person might have been you, senpai. I even thought of something as absurd as that, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then it\u2019s fine if I told you. You wanna listen?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked with a smile and Tamura also answered back with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><br/><p>I see\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Well then, I shall tell you all about it.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2019About the time I was reincarnated as a slime\u2019\u2014</p><br/><p>THE END</p><br/><p>=======================================</p><br/><p>[1]  \u300c\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u300d \u2013 Tenmazoku. Pronounced \u201cEnjeru\u201d or \u201cAngel\u201d, compared to  Tenshi, which is the japanese word for \u2018angels\u2019.

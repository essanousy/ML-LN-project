You know, somehow I feel I don\u2019t know much about you.</p><br/><p>Clown: That\u2019s because you\u2019re always depressed.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: And what does that have to do within anything?</p><br/><p>Clown: Why you simply didn\u2019t care for your surrounding. Hence\u2013you know nearly nothing about me.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Let\u2019s fix that then. Who was your first friend?</p><br/><p>Clown: Huh? One second\u2026 that\u2019s a hard one\u2026 I remember a girl with blue hair. She always wore a dazzling smile\u2026 Acchan\u2026</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Who?</p><br/><p>Clown: Sorry, a headache. Umm\u2026 Aiko\u2026 Kanzaki Aiko was her name.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Huh. That was very interesting\u2026 not!</p><br/><p>Clown: Then pick a better question! Actually, wait, it\u2019s my turn. What\u2019s your favorite fish? To eat, I mean.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Either Tuna or Salmon.</p><br/><p>Clown: \u2026</p><br/><p>Pierrot: What?</p><br/><p>Clown: Why did the fish blush? Because he saw the boat\u2019s bottom</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.Translator\u2019s Corner (Cast: AK and AK)</p><br/><p>AK: I think Clown-sama is slowly losing her mind.</p><br/><p>AK: No, no. It is Pierrot-san who is the one losing it.</p><br/><p>AK: No. I am certain it is Clown-sama.</p><br/><p>AK: Says the person arguing with himself.</p><br/><p>Life in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>064. Last Days in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>Now that I can rest in peace with regards to the children\u2019s health, I decided that it was time for us to return.</p><br/><p>When I told Ramiris that we were leaving and turned to do so,</p><br/><p>\u300cWait! Heeeey, wait!\u300d</p><br/><p>She grabbed and pulled me by the collar.</p><br/><p>Being strangled feels pretty nasty. Even if I don\u2019t need to breathe, it is not a pleasant feeling.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? Picking a fight?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAm not! I helped you so shouldn\u2019t you show your gratitude somehow?</p><br/><p>Of course, you appreciation is thanks enough? But as a fellow person\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, my bad. I\u2019m not a person after all! So\u2026 I\u2019m off!\u300d</p><br/><p>I quickly retorted.</p><br/><p>\u300cUwaaaaa~, wait, wait!</p><br/><p>Hey, you know, we\u2019re in trouble!</p><br/><p>\u2018Cause you destroyed the golem we lost our guardian!</p><br/><p>Look at us, we\u2019re all kids here! Really weak, you know?</p><br/><p>THE-RE-FORE! We\u2019re in trouble! Can\u2019t you do something about that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026..\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmph.</p><br/><p>What a pain. I could simply say \u201cyou reap what you sow\u201d but it is true that I was the one to break it.</p><br/><p>Why did I have to vaporize it without a trace\u2026 Well, I guess it is true that I went too far there.</p><br/><p>Even though demonic steel is excellent against demonic abilities, it, as every other metal, has a melting point.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s not a surprise that it melted.</p><br/><p>In the first place, I did think that with\u300eGreat Sage\u300f-sensei, I would be fine regardless; and that\u2019s how it turned out.</p><br/><p>I really should have dropped the output a bit\u2026</p><br/><p>Now then, in place of the golem\u2026</p><br/><p>I could compensate them with demonic steel, but I feel that would be a waste. Just imagining how much I would need to give to make a golem that size makes me dizzy.</p><br/><p>Hmph\u2026</p><br/><p>Should I make a human sized doll and have the spirits possess it?</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. Verified command Create: Golem. Creation possible.</p><br/><p>Abilities can be added through a spirit or a demon.</p><br/><p>The outward appearance will be according to your imagination.</p><br/><p>Please decide on a summoning target when creating the golem.\u226b</p><br/><p>Way to go\u300eGreat Sage\u300f.</p><br/><p>Seems like it pulled the appropriate spell from thousands of magic archives in an instant.</p><br/><p>A relatively simple magic. Summoning magic I first saw during the adventurer exam and have been analyzing it ever since.</p><br/><p>So, all I need to decide is whether to use a demon or a spirit.</p><br/><p>A spirit, as the previous cases have shown, tend to without a personality.</p><br/><p>So a demon? Frankly, though their name makes them sound like a backstabbing bunch, they aren\u2019t like that at all.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the summoning contract they cannot betray the summoner. Well, as long as it is reasonable.</p><br/><p>Any request beyond the original contract annuls it. Such an act testifies that the parties involved are not satisfied with each other</p><br/><p>But I guess it\u2019s wrong to label demons as evil just because they are demons.</p><br/><p>So, let\u2019s make a golem using demonic steel and summon us a demon.</p><br/><p>Frankly, I should be able to make an item far stronger than any A-ranked monster around.</p><br/><p>\u300cI got it, I got it. You\u2019re noisy, Rami-chan.</p><br/><p>Listen up, I\u2019ll make you a guardian, so no more complains.</p><br/><p>As compensation, teach me a bit about the Ghost Researchers later on!</p><br/><p>Grandpa Kaijin in my city is deeply curious about them.</p><br/><p>He was working on the Ghost Researcher golem before!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s no problem, I\u2019ll tell you about them any time! What kind of golem will you make?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Ah, a stronger one than the one I defeated\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously?! You\u2026 you are so nice!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2026 guess. Oh, I\u2019ll make it, but you can\u2019t use it for evil deeds or anything?</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll place a master lock on it so that it\u2019s only usable for your defense!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, okay! No problem! But we can play around with it in here, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Ah\u2026 as long as its in here. But don\u2019t go causing trouble, okay?</p><br/><p>And by the way, according to my (Great Sage\u2019s) predictions, it\u2019ll turn out really powerful!</p><br/><p>If handled poorly there will be victims, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, and began preparations.</p><br/><p>I took out demon steel from my stomach and stacked them up.</p><br/><p>Having swam around in my magical energy for a long time, the steel is of excellent quality.</p><br/><p>The children, interested, crowded around to watch.</p><br/><p>\u300cHe\u2013, where did you pull that from\u2026 I don\u2019t even know anymore\u2026!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris started to say something but gave up half-way.</p><br/><p>By the looks of it, she gave up not just on the conversation\u2026</p><br/><p>When I was pleased with the items I took out, I got to work.</p><br/><p>Spreading my arms I began to chant a spell.</p><br/><p>Considering that there is an altar up ahead, this may prove dangerous so I had the kids step back.</p><br/><p>So only Ramiris is standing behind me.</p><br/><p>Now then, I hope it succeeds, but I\u2019ll be happy as long as it doesn\u2019t rampage.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve used up quite a lot of power to alter the spirits.</p><br/><p>In an answer to my chant, a magic circle began to form on the floor. Oh and I don\u2019t really need the chant, I just felt it matched the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>From withing the magic circle a Greater Demon appeared.</p><br/><p>Kneeling before me, facing the ground,</p><br/><p>\u300cHave you called me, my great master!\u300d</p><br/><p>It said.</p><br/><p>A Greater Demon.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if there are individual differences between them, but it\u2019s far more muscular than the lesser demon.</p><br/><p>Its skin is black, garbed in expensive clothing. Unknown gender. From both sides of its head, horns protrude.</p><br/><p>By the way, do demons even have muscles? Ah, whatever.</p><br/><p>\u300cYup. I have called none other than you.</p><br/><p>I want you to possess the golem I will make.</p><br/><p>Payment is my magical energy. The length of the contract is\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I look at Ramiris for an answer,</p><br/><p>\u300cA hundred years! In a hundred years I will finally grow up!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what she said.</p><br/><p>\u300cLength of the contract is 100 years.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, you can keep the body or throw it away. How about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>Had I said something like \u201cDefeat the one before you!\u201d, the contract would have been annulled. Anyways, what a troublesome thing the length of the contract is!</p><br/><p>When nearby, I\u2019ll have to refill his magical energy supply, and make sure he doesn\u2019t try to reincarnate.</p><br/><p>And as long as I watch over this being, I cannot summon another\u2026. well, there is a way around that rule.</p><br/><p>But for now, I need him to protect the fairies here.</p><br/><p>So let\u2019s explain to him his duties.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat much is simple, my great master! And I have already received the payment.\u300d</p><br/><p>Huh? The energy I used in summoning is enough?</p><br/><p>Well, he did take quite a bit already. But I have plenty to go around.</p><br/><p>In any case, it seems like slowly summoning him was a good idea. As a result, he shows due respect.</p><br/><p>Had I offered little energy in the process it might have tried to kill me\u2013but that kind of thing can be fixed with a proper contract.</p><br/><p>Just to be safe, let\u2019s make sure we properly summon things and make proper contracts.</p><br/><p>Well, the contract portion aside, all that\u2019s left is the golem.</p><br/><p>I start working on the demonic steel.</p><br/><p>A doll necessarily uses spherical joints. That much cannot be avoided. But surprisingly, it\u2019s coming out just as I had imagined it.</p><br/><p>In my previous life, I was jealous of my friends who could make figurines from scratch. Unfortunately, the best the clumsy I could do was put together a model.</p><br/><p>However, I have changed!</p><br/><p>Thanks to\u300eGreat Sage\u300f\u2019s correction, it\u2019s coming out just as I had imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatcha doing?\u201d Ramiris peeked over my shoulder, and started making noise.</p><br/><p>\u300cWha! What! This is amazing! What skill!</p><br/><p>You are seriously amazing you know! Can you really make such a thing move?\u300d</p><br/><p>She was very excited. But even I, the creator, hadn\u2019t believed I could make it with such precision.</p><br/><p>Chances are, the fact that I am using pure demonic steel allowed me to shape it as I wanted.</p><br/><p>The greater demon looking from afar, upon realizing that it is his body in the making, showed a face of pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>Probably\u2026 I can\u2019t read demon\u2019s expressions well.</p><br/><p>\u300cWonderful, as expected of my master.</p><br/><p>Honestly, in order to move the golem all that is needed is to direct magical energy into the joins.</p><br/><p>Should that be done, the golem will move. What a wonderful body has been made for me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Since he\u2019s happy, I guess the body fits.</p><br/><p>After taking the demon\u2019s and Ramiris\u2019 requests into consideration, I finished the golem.</p><br/><p>I made the face look like the mask I always wear; the golem was as large as a human.</p><br/><p>180cm tall to be precise.</p><br/><p>For the large Greater Demon it must have seemed tiny, but I guess that wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><br/><p>Thus, I successfully finished the golem.</p><br/><p>The Greater Demon was able to possess it without any problem.</p><br/><p>By the way, the melting point for most rare resources is around 5,000 degress. Demonic Steel can withstand temperatures up to 9,900 degrees.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it can regenerate\u2013in a word, it\u2019s superb.</p><br/><p>So honestly, destroying this golem will prove really difficult.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow do you feel?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. Wonderful\u2026 my overall strength has risen.</p><br/><p>Compared to incarnating into a monster or a human, the raw power aside, defensive abilities are far superior.</p><br/><p>How wonderful!!! This is an amazing body!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He reported after verifying the body\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>In order to stay in this world a demon needs a body; animals and monsters are often used to that end.</p><br/><p>Instead, I gave him a magically created doll, but that doesn\u2019t seem to have caused any problem. Perhaps he recognized it as a monster.</p><br/><p>After thoroughly investigating the body, he faced me on his knees, and</p><br/><p>\u300cI hope to prove my usefulness to You with this body!</p><br/><p>After I have protected the fairies for a hundred years, please allow me to serve under you!\u300d</p><br/><p>He suddenly said.</p><br/><p>A hundred years from now\u2026 will I be alive then or not, I myself don\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>\u300cWould I even be alive then?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, what a good joke! What could a mere hundred years do to someone of your caliber, my master?</p><br/><p>If you only promise me this, I will never bother you with another payment!\u300d</p><br/><p>That being said, just how long is my lifespan?</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t though much about that\u2026 ah, whatever.</p><br/><p>However, he seems very attached.</p><br/><p>Am I am predisposed to be loved by monsters or something? Now then\u2026 a name\u2026</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have much energy remaining. Judging by previous cases, a high ranking monster will absorb a lot of energy.</p><br/><p>And this is a Great Demon, and a high ranking one among them.</p><br/><p>If anything, he\u2019s at least rank A-, but with a body he\u2019s definitely at least A rank. So, considering all the demonic steel I used to create the body, he\u2019s way over rank A.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026 should be fine, right? I still have over 40% left, after all.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright! In that case, you shall be known as Beretta from now on!</p><br/><p>I accept your loyalty! You first job will be to guard Ramiries and the fairies for a hundred years.</p><br/><p>I expect your best effort!\u300d</p><br/><p>I bestowed upon him such a name.</p><br/><p>His beautiful form reminded me of the famous weapon.</p><br/><p>And then my energy was sucked out. But this time, I had endured it. Barely above empty.</p><br/><p>This guy, managed to absorb 30% of my energy by himself\u2026 That\u2019s a lot.</p><br/><p>And after being named by me, he started to evolve.</p><br/><p>Seems like the time until evolution starts has also gotten shorter.</p><br/><p>He first formed into a circle, but then chest, head, hips, arms, and legs formed, along with a face.</p><br/><p>Looking just like a human.</p><br/><p>A gender-less human. His expression was now hidden behind a mask and, instead of the black skin, long black hair now adorned his body.</p><br/><p>The skin was pale, and bloodless. As to be expected from a doll.</p><br/><p>As the transformation began to stop, clothing appeared.</p><br/><p>The eye slits on the mask glowed crimson. Seems like the evolution has ended.</p><br/><p>Now, I wander what abilities it had inherited from me? Its appearance has become very human-like.</p><br/><p>Seems like the body was perfected along with the evolution.</p><br/><p>And what a beautiful body it had become.</p><br/><p>But, the expression that was hidden by the mask was not of a sympathetic being, but a doll of destruction.</p><br/><p>Only death would await those who have seen his expression. To all, other than the master, of course.</p><br/><p>Beretta stood up, and once again bowed deeply before me.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy great master. I am the Ark Doll Beretta.</p><br/><p>Who lives and breathes to fulfill your will!\u300d</p><br/><p>And, after bowing again, he turned to Ramiris.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs commanded by my master, I shall protect thee.\u300d</p><br/><p>He declared.</p><br/><p>Ramiris, as if overwhelmed by his presence, nodded timidly.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yeah! I\u2019ll be in your care! Do protect us!\u300d</p><br/><p>After regaining her composure, she so said.</p><br/><p>So, yeah? I guess that\u2019s a good enough substitute for the golem.</p><br/><p>At least twice as strong.</p><br/><p>This much should satisfy Ramiris\u2019 request.</p><br/><p>But it seems I have gotten carried away and used more demonic steel than I had intended.</p><br/><p>When making it, I kept debating about this and that, and ended up overusing the ingredients.</p><br/><p>So remember, I went through the trouble to make you, so you better be useful!</p><br/><p>The children have fallen asleep while I was making the doll.</p><br/><p>Their lives that were filled with tension and fear till now have suddenly become relaxed.</p><br/><p>They held well up until now, and can finally relax.</p><br/><p>So, they are sleeping happily, using Ranga as a pillow. And if I think about it, though I don\u2019t need sleep, the children certainly do.</p><br/><p>As they say, you sleep well, you grow well.</p><br/><p>So let\u2019s wait until the children wake up. Until they do, I\u2019ll also rest up.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Thus, after creating a guardian for the fairies, we left the\u300eSpiritual Dwelling\u300fbehind.</p><br/><p>The children have obtained a spirit, their bodies have stabilized\u2013all problems solved.</p><br/><p>Or so I thought\u2026</p><br/><p>As per Yuuki\u2019s request, three months have passed.</p><br/><p>I have many times discussed the children\u2019s future with him.</p><br/><p>We have considered having Tempest take custody of them, but figured they need a better learning environment.</p><br/><p>Besides, they are currently in a school with many excellent lecturers. It\u2019s also a place where they can study magic.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they themselves have chosen to study here. They had thought that I\u2019d be staying with them, so they cried when I told them about my departure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come visit you for graduation!\u201d I promised them.</p><br/><p>Of course, we\u2019ll throw a party.</p><br/><p>Though living next to the church may restrict their freedom, as they are now, they\u2019ll easily deceive the church.</p><br/><p>The magical power no longer leaks, and has stabilized around normal levels. Nor will people with analyzing abilities be able to discover them.</p><br/><p>I had asked Yuuki about that once.</p><br/><p>\u300cAt least, three years from now, when they think the children dead and buried, they should be safe\u300d</p><br/><p>If they stay patient for three years they\u2019ll be able to depart on their own.</p><br/><p>For now, as long as they cover their faces with a mask, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.</p><br/><p>Yuuki has many times asked me how I had saved them, but I decided not to tell him.</p><br/><p>To him, the children seem as nothing more than normal civilians. And that\u2019s as it should be.</p><br/><p>Their power is currently being balanced by spiritual energy; when that balances out, they might acquire their own unique skill.</p><br/><p>Unless other problems appear, they probably don\u2019t need to know about that.</p><br/><p>Besides, they might not even acquire one. So I didn\u2019t tell the kids about this.</p><br/><p>Ending the matter with the children thus, I spent the rest of the time having fun.</p><br/><p>Having a picnic for example, or hanging around with the three idiots.</p><br/><p>My sales are also going well, and when I had time I visited Myormiles, in the middle of the second month here, he warmly welcomed me.</p><br/><p>Thanks to my evolved ability\u300eSpatial Travel\u300fI can immediately transfer to a place I had visited before. It is far faster than shadow step.</p><br/><p>And using the gold I received from him, I bought some Magic Stones from Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Thus, our research will see some real progress soon.</p><br/><p>So doing this and that, the three months in the Royal Capital passed.</p><br/><p>On the day I set off for home, I left the crying children and the Royal Capital behind.</p><br/><p>It felt short, but I lived quite a while in the human city.</p><br/><p>Though the incident with the children was troublesome, I was able to bond with them as a result.</p><br/><p>I had never thought that I, who had become a slime, could befriend children like them.</p><br/><p>And I made a fortune with the sales.</p><br/><p>I had once returned to the city to see lots of adventurers crowding our streets.</p><br/><p>So everything is going well.</p><br/><p>\u2026 No, everything was going too well.</p><br/><p>In this world, jealousy and envy, the feelings of a loser, creep into one\u2019s heart when you least expect it.</p><br/><p>I had planned to live without every feeling such emotions.</p><br/><p>However, if you make a mistake in the data, you will inevitably come to a wrong conclusion. As\u300eGreat Sage\u300fsays, if the question is wrong, the answer will also be wrong.</p><br/><p>If Tempest is prospering, there are people who can make money off of it failing.</p><br/><p>I had thought that I understood that fact, but hardly did I know how much I underestimated them.</p><br/><p>And the result\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI have been searching for you, Rimuru-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I had left the Royal Capital, a voice called out to me.</p><br/><p>One of the people working for Youmu, the devil Grucius.</p><br/><p>He was struggling to catch his breath, having run all the way here non-stop.</p><br/><p>By the looks of it, something has happened.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>To my question,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Farmas Kingdom\u2026 has sent troops towards Tempest!\u300d</p><br/><p>The worst case scenario unfolded before me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy events are often accompanied by terrible ones\u201d is that it? Even so, this is the worst possible scenario.</p><br/><p>I had immediately decided to return to Tempest.</p><br/><p>\u300cWill you come with me?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I asked, as if something had happened to Youmu\u2019s group, Grucius gladly took me up on the offer.</p><br/><p>I began rapid transfer.</p><br/><p>Thus, together with Grucius, we tried transferring to Tempest.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Since being born into this world as a slime, I have lived as I had always wanted.</p><br/><p>I have met and spoken with some World Travelers.</p><br/><p>While I was busy fulfilling trivial desire, a great storm loomed over my city.</p><br/><p>So even though I succeeded, I had also failed.</p><br/><p>As a civilian that I was, I hardly had any practice in predicting the political machinations of countries\u2013hence the result.</p><br/><p>The gears of fate spun nefariously, leading me closer to my fate.</p><br/><p>The era of peace has now passed, and the time of war has begun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

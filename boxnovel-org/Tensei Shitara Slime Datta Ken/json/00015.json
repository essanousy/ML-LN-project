I should secretly turn back into a slime and\u2026. Run away.</p><br/><p>I thought to myself, \u2018Eureka!\u2019.</p><br/><p>But as I returned to my slime form and attempted escape\u2026</p><br/><p>Grab!</p><br/><p>My body was abruptly seized, and then a feeling of being suspended came</p><br/><p>over me.</p><br/><p>I was so easily captured\u2026</p><br/><p>The soldier-san who caught me was smiling with a face that said, \u2018Where</p><br/><p>do you think you\u2019re going?\u2019</p><br/><p>But I could tell by the bulging vein in his forehead, that he wasn\u2019t happy in</p><br/><p>the least.</p><br/><p>[Wai-, I haven\u2019t done anything you know! I\u2019m also a victim in this matter!]</p><br/><p>I tried pleading the way Gobuta-kun would, however\u2026</p><br/><p>[Uh huh. Is that right! All the same, I\u2019ll listen to your story at the guard</p><br/><p>station! You\u2019d better not think about running away!]</p><br/><p>He still wore that wonderful smile, even as he warned me.</p><br/><p>It might be a better idea to just give in\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly I thought to myself, \u2018What\u2019s Gobuta-kun doing right now?\u2019, and</p><br/><p>when I looked around\u2026</p><br/><p>I saw that even now, his eyes were still closed and his ears covered.</p><br/><p>\u2026That idiot! What was he thinking?</p><br/><p>No wait\u2026he was probably not thinking at all. He was a ninny after all.</p><br/><p>While feeling somewhat amazed, I called Gobuta-kun over.</p><br/><p>And this was how we were dragged away to the guard station.</p><br/><p>The order of how events played out that time!</p><br/><p>First, I was forced into a fight!</p><br/><p>Second, I transformed into a wolf!</p><br/><p>Third, I let out a howl at a teensy bit loud volume.</p><br/><p>How about it? I\u2019m not to blame right?</p><br/><p>With that in mind, I sneaked a quick look up at soldier-san.</p><br/><p>As ever, he was still wearing that wonderful smile.</p><br/><p>His beard was a fine match with his good natured and hearty looks.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s such a pity though~, if only those veins on his forehead would calm</p><br/><p>down\u2026</p><br/><p>[Uhm~, why was I brought along with you?]</p><br/><p>[You i-di-ot! What are you saying? Because you got involved in that mess,</p><br/><p>we are the ones getting reprimanded!]</p><br/><p>[Eh?! So that\u2019s what happened! I\u2019m really sorry\u2026. I caused alot of troubles</p><br/><p>again\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[Well, it couldn\u2019t be helped this time, but make sure to be more careful</p><br/><p>next time alright?]</p><br/><p>Whew. I think I fooled him somehow. What I used just now was the</p><br/><p>ultimate skill, \u201cshifting blame\u201d!</p><br/><p>*Original text is \u306e\u305b\u3044. I\u2019m pretty sure it has to do with controlling blame, but not completely</p><br/><p>sure. If you know what it means please let me know</p><br/><p>This was an advanced social technique which you could master only after</p><br/><p>many years of life experience. The trick was to not let the other party</p><br/><p>suspect you.</p><br/><p>It was considerably difficult to use!</p><br/><p>*If you\u2019re wondering what that accomplished, the guard\u2019s mood got a little better, I guess</p><br/><p>Moving on.</p><br/><p>Actually, while I did jokingly recount how the incident had occurred, it</p><br/><p>was mostly quite accurate.</p><br/><p>Using the information they gained from the witnesses, the guards had also</p><br/><p>reached the same conclusion as how I had described it.</p><br/><p>I felt that their attitudes towards me had become softer to a certain extent.</p><br/><p>[Now. About that demon wolf. What was it?]</p><br/><p>Asking the question was the soldier-san who was in charge of the</p><br/><p>investigation.</p><br/><p>What did he mean by what it was?</p><br/><p>The name of its species?</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s see, the name of that wolf species is-\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Not that. I don\u2019t need to know the name of its species, or anything like</p><br/><p>that. Why did that kind of demon appear in that place? To begin with,</p><br/><p>where did it come from and where did it go? Speak of everything you</p><br/><p>know!]</p><br/><p>Mm?</p><br/><p>Although I told them I transformed into the wolf, it seems they don\u2019t</p><br/><p>believe me?</p><br/><p>As a rule, heroes hide the fact that they can transform, but I\u2019m no hero.</p><br/><p>That was why I had openly talked like a chatterbox, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>[No\u2026now see here, I\u2019m telling you that it was me who transformed into</p><br/><p>that wolf!]</p><br/><p>[Ha~. Really, I get that it\u2019s rare for a slime being able to talk, but</p><br/><p>transformation?]</p><br/><p>[Wait wait, then should I show you I can do it?]</p><br/><p>[Hmph. Well whatever. However, let\u2019s say for arguments sake that the wolf</p><br/><p>really was you. Why can you transform? Aren\u2019t you a slime?]</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>Confronted with such a question, how should I reply?</p><br/><p>Honestly answering, \u2018It\u2019s a unique skill!\u2019, would be a foolish move. If I did</p><br/><p>that, it would put me on the same level as Gobuta-kun.</p><br/><p>Think!</p><br/><p>Come up a good explanation right this moment, me!!!</p><br/><p>[To tell you the truth\u2026a magician cast a curse on me. I think it was done</p><br/><p>out of jealousy for my talent\u2026. Back then, I was a user of illusion magic.]</p><br/><p>[Uh huh. Cursed by a magician\u2026you say. And?]</p><br/><p>[Well err, right. I had learned a number of illusion spells and was fully</p><br/><p>focused on studying, but an evil magician changed me into a slime\u2026</p><br/><p>Right now, I\u2019m on a journey to find a method to break the curse on me\u2026</p><br/><p>and that\u2019s how it is!]</p><br/><p>[How did you come to meet this evil magician? Why were you not killed</p><br/><p>but instead cursed??]</p><br/><p>Ughh\u2026it would have been so nice if he took everything at face value\u2026.</p><br/><p>His persistence was almost annoying.</p><br/><p>Well, it was reasonable I suppose. If he believed me just like that, I would</p><br/><p>consider him no better than a goblin.</p><br/><p>And from then on, a seemingly never ending 2 hours passed.</p><br/><p>It was a time of non-stop offense and defense (questions and answers)</p><br/><p>between me and soldier-san.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>-The passionate exchange of words between the two, had gradually given</p><br/><p>shape to a never-before heard of story.</p><br/><p>A story about a certain beautiful girl, who was cursed by an evil magician</p><br/><p>and turned into a slime.-</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t mean for it turn out that way, but in the midst of responding to</p><br/><p>every one of soldier-san\u2019s pinpoint questions, I had given birth to an</p><br/><p>exceedingly strange story.</p><br/><p>In the story, I was the young maiden who was a prodigy of transforming</p><br/><p>and illusion magic. She was cursed by a witch and was on a journey to</p><br/><p>break the spell, or so it went\u2026</p><br/><p>You may ask, how did it come to this?</p><br/><p>Whenever I had mentioned something odd, soldier-san would mercilessly</p><br/><p>tackle it in the name of cross-examination.</p><br/><p>And in the process of fixing up my story enough to make him say, \u2018So</p><br/><p>that\u2019s how it was!\u2019, it was already too late\u2026</p><br/><p>Me and soldier-san. At the end of it, we had exchanged looks full of a</p><br/><p>feeling of accomplishment\u2026though I had no eyes!</p><br/><p>No words were said, but our feelings got across to each other.</p><br/><p>[Alright! The written evidence (though the content is nonsensical\u2026) is</p><br/><p>completed! Thanks for your co-operation! By the way, what will you two-</p><br/><p>\u2026]</p><br/><p>Slam!</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s-, it\u2019s terrible! Down at the mines, an Armorsaurus appeared! They say</p><br/><p>that several miners who were picking ores have already been injured!]</p><br/><p>[What?! So, has this Armorsaurus been put down yet?]</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s no problem there! Just now, a suppression unit has been sent over.</p><br/><p>But those who were wounded are in bad conditions. I don\u2019t know whether</p><br/><p>it was for war preparations or something else, but everything related to</p><br/><p>medicines have been sold off, and it seems they won\u2019t bring out the</p><br/><p>emergency stores in the castle\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Are there no healers?]</p><br/><p>[That is\u2026you know that to mine \u201cmagic ores\u201d you need to go deep into</p><br/><p>the caves, right? At the moment, all of the capable healers are away</p><br/><p>escorting the miners, and the only ones available right now are</p><br/><p>greenhorns!!!]</p><br/><p>[What did you say\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>It appeared to be a serious situation\u2026and they\u2019ve completely forgotten I</p><br/><p>was there.</p><br/><p>I thought to myself, \u2018If there are emergency supplies in the castle, bring</p><br/><p>them out!\u2019\u2026.</p><br/><p>Restorative medicine huh. Although I have them\u2026what should I do?</p><br/><p>[Oi, mister! Mister!!!]</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve decided to hand them some.</p><br/><p>As for why I would do this, it\u2019s not like I thought maybe building a good</p><br/><p>image of myself would perhaps would prove my innocence in the earlier</p><br/><p>incident\u2026it\u2019s absolutely not like that!</p><br/><p>Saving lives is a natural thing to do!</p><br/><p>Though I admit, I sounded suspicious\u2026</p><br/><p>But they say that compassion is not for the benefit of others. In other</p><br/><p>words, something good may happen for me!</p><br/><p>[What is it? I\u2019m busy right now! The investigation is finished now, but I</p><br/><p>can\u2019t release you yet. For a while, you\u2019ll be waiting in this place!]</p><br/><p>[No no, not that. It\u2019s about this, you see?]</p><br/><p>I took out medicine from a pocket. (Or from their view, I simply spat it</p><br/><p>out.)</p><br/><p>[\u2026? Ah, what\u2019s this?]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s restorative medicine. It\u2019s of excellent quality! Good for drinking!</p><br/><p>Good for applying on wounds!]</p><br/><p>[Ha? Why would a slime like you be holding on to something like</p><br/><p>medicine?]</p><br/><p>Hey now\u2026. Where did my setting (story of a young maiden) from before</p><br/><p>go.</p><br/><p>Just now I was completely treated like a slime! As I expected, he was also</p><br/><p>going along with the flow at that time.</p><br/><p>Well putting that aside\u2026</p><br/><p>[That doesn\u2019t really matter right? Please try using it. How many do you</p><br/><p>need?]</p><br/><p>[Six people were injured but\u2026will you have enough?]</p><br/><p>The young soldier-san, that had come to report the situation, was glaring</p><br/><p>at me with suspicion.</p><br/><p>A demon giving you medicine\u2026if it was me, I wouldn\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>[Tsk! No matter, don\u2019t leave the room! We\u2019re going now!]</p><br/><p>[Eh? But, captain\u2026that\u2019s a demon you know?]</p><br/><p>[Quiet! We\u2019re going! Hurry and lead the way!!!]</p><br/><p>While saying that, the bearded soldier-san who was called captain snatched</p><br/><p>the 6 medicines I had taken out and took off running.</p><br/><p>Although we never had a proper talk with each other, I think he decided to</p><br/><p>trust in me.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be a good person, just like his appearance. Though it was</p><br/><p>surprising that he was a captain.</p><br/><p>[Is it over now?]</p><br/><p>It was Gobuta-kun who was asking. He had been silent right from the</p><br/><p>beginning of the interrogation, only nodding the occasional agreements to</p><br/><p>my claims.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not over yet, but well\u2026let\u2019s see how it turns out.]</p><br/><p>[Roger that!]</p><br/><p>From then on, we waited in a completely spaced out state of mind.</p><br/><p>Occasionally, among the soldiers that were coming and going out of the</p><br/><p>guard station, a few would stare at us in confusion, tilting their heads\u2026</p><br/><p>We had spent 1 hour waiting.</p><br/><p>I was practicing my control over spider threads to kill time, when I sensed</p><br/><p>the footsteps of the returning captain and his men.</p><br/><p>Stopping what I was doing, I went back to the waiting room.</p><br/><p>Gobuta-kun was sleeping there. This guy\u2026unexpectedly, he might actually</p><br/><p>be an amazing fellow!</p><br/><p>[You saved us! Thanks.]</p><br/><p>Entering the room, the captain said thanks while bowing his head.</p><br/><p>Also with him, was a group of miners that had followed behind.</p><br/><p>[I heard you were the one who gave the medicine! Thank you!!!]</p><br/><p>[To be frank, I was on the verge of losing an arm, and not being able to</p><br/><p>work anymore\u2026really, thank you!!!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026.]</p><br/><p>The miners were all expressing their appreciation in turns.</p><br/><p>Oh there\u2019s one guy left\u2026why wasn\u2019t he saying anything!</p><br/><p>Well, I\u2019ve properly received their feelings of gratitude.</p><br/><p>A while passed, and the miners had all finished what they came to say and</p><br/><p>left already.</p><br/><p>Before I had noticed, the sun was already going down and it was getting</p><br/><p>darker outside.</p><br/><p>After that, the captain and I shared another conversation. This time, I didn\u2019t</p><br/><p>hide anything from him.</p><br/><p>The five people, from the previous disastrous incident, turned out to be</p><br/><p>adventurers that were part of this country\u2019s Freedom Association.</p><br/><p>Apparently, they were talented individuals, but were quite well known for</p><br/><p>their troublemaking.</p><br/><p>Without holding anything back, the captain had laughingly said, \u2018That</p><br/><p>oughta teach them a lesson!\u2019.</p><br/><p>He also informed me, that while it was already confirmed that we didn\u2019t do</p><br/><p>anything wrong in particular, but taking into consideration the feelings of</p><br/><p>the bystanders involved in that incident, there was no choice but to detain</p><br/><p>us.</p><br/><p>I found out that a damage report was never made.</p><br/><p>But really, it was understandable. Making a complaint saying, \u2018I want</p><br/><p>compensation for my soiled underwear!\u2019, would be extremely</p><br/><p>embarrassing.</p><br/><p>In return, I also told him of our circumstances.</p><br/><p>For the sake of reviving the goblin village, we needed clothes, weapons</p><br/><p>and armors. If possible, I also wanted to hire a capable advisor for the</p><br/><p>village, and so on.</p><br/><p>The captain had listened attentively throughout it all with keen interest.</p><br/><p>When the other guards learned of our situation, they had begun talking to</p><br/><p>me about all sorts of things. Even Gobuta-kun was besieged with questions</p><br/><p>from all sides, having to constantly reply with a bewildered expression.</p><br/><p>And like that, the night passed\u2026.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>We were still staying at the guard station.</p><br/><p>Gobuta-kun was borrowing the resting room. He must still be asleep.</p><br/><p>Since I didn\u2019t need sleep, I was already out in the backyard, gazing at the</p><br/><p>scene of the guards training. Some were practicing swinging their wooden</p><br/><p>swords (or more like logs), others were exchanging light blows in a spar,</p><br/><p>while the rest were working out by running.</p><br/><p>I was leisurely watching from the sidelines.</p><br/><p>Taking in the situation before me, I simulated in my mind, a fight between</p><br/><p>the various demons I have used Predation on, and the training guards.</p><br/><p>It felt just like a game.</p><br/><p>Still, I wonder if using \u300eGreat Sage\u300f in this way was alright? The way I</p><br/><p>was using it, it could be described as like pearls before swine\u2026</p><br/><p>Be that as it may, it couldn\u2019t be helped since it was interesting. There was</p><br/><p>no problem at all.</p><br/><p>The result of the simulation: overwhelming victory by the demons.</p><br/><p>Even when the guards were given a handicap, only a few could manage to</p><br/><p>defeat the bat and lizard.</p><br/><p>In a 1 vs 1 situation, the conditions were too favorable for the demons.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed that in a group battle, with 5~6 people which made up</p><br/><p>one party, there were a few party combinations that were able to beat my</p><br/><p>spider.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, even with all 20 of the training guards, they were not be</p><br/><p>able to kill my centipede.</p><br/><p>In any case, I knew that the men here weren\u2019t of the strongest fighters in</p><br/><p>this country, so perhaps this was a standard level of strength.</p><br/><p>While I was doing that, Gobuta-kun had also woken up.</p><br/><p>The captain was also here, reporting for duty.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re free to go. I feel bad for confining you up till now. Though we had</p><br/><p>a reputation to uphold, we ended up taking up a day of your time. Sorry!]</p><br/><p>[No no, saving on lodging expenses was very helpful!]</p><br/><p>[Hearing that really puts me at ease. As an apology, let me introduce you to</p><br/><p>a skilled blacksmith!]</p><br/><p>[That would be splendid! Thank you very much!]</p><br/><p>Things were looking up for us.</p><br/><p>Regarding the immigration inspection, we were given something of a</p><br/><p>preferential treatment and it was completed without a hitch, while on the</p><br/><p>other hand we saved money on lodging fees.</p><br/><p>I also expected difficulty in searching for a capable blacksmith, but</p><br/><p>soldier-san\u2019s recommendation solved everything!</p><br/><p>Looking at it optimistically, nothing but good things had happened to us!</p><br/><p>[But in return for that\u2026]</p><br/><p>Mm? Was there a hidden catch to this?</p><br/><p>When it came to things hidden beneath the surface, videos were all I</p><br/><p>liked\u2026</p><br/><p>*Meant to be a pun on underground videos=pirated videos. Because under the guise of something</p><br/><p>good there was something bad and underground videos are pirated videos and pirated videos are bad</p><br/><p>and\u2026forget it</p><br/><p>**It could also be about p*rn. I\u2019m just saying</p><br/><p>[If you still have any of those medicines remaining, I want to buy them!]</p><br/><p>I see now.</p><br/><p>I did hear about it yesterday, that somehow supplies on medicine were low.</p><br/><p>Seeing as I have a huge stock of medicines, it would be fine selling them\u2026</p><br/><p>but I didn\u2019t know the market price for them.</p><br/><p>What to do?</p><br/><p>Well, whatever.</p><br/><p>These medicines didn\u2019t cost anything to produce after all. If he says he</p><br/><p>needs them, then I\u2019ll just hand over some.</p><br/><p>[I can agree to that. Although I say that, I do need them myself, so it</p><br/><p>depends on how many you need.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll be fine with just taking the leftovers. Even if only one is left, I\u2019ll take</p><br/><p>it!]</p><br/><p>Hn? Isn\u2019t that strange?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he trying to procure a reserve supply of medicines?</p><br/><p>Having just one, wouldn\u2019t solve anything in the hour of need\u2026</p><br/><p>I suppose the need for medicine is just that great.</p><br/><p>[Mm\u2026then, how about 5?]</p><br/><p>[5! That\u2019ll be great!]</p><br/><p>[Aah, and also, did you know that it\u2019ll probably still have a good effect</p><br/><p>when diluted with water? When treating the average injury, just 1/10 of the</p><br/><p>medicine should be fine!]</p><br/><p>When I explained how it worked, the captain nodded with a face that</p><br/><p>yelled, \u2018I want more!\u2019.</p><br/><p>After making sure he understood, I handed over the 5 pieces of medicine</p><br/><p>and in return, I received a small bag.</p><br/><p>Opening the bag, I saw some gold coins inside.</p><br/><p>[Although it may not be much, it was everything we could take out. I hope</p><br/><p>you can let me have them all for 5 coins each!]</p><br/><p>It appeared that 5 pieces of medicine were worth 25 gold coins.</p><br/><p>But at the present, I couldn\u2019t tell profit from loss, so I thought to make use</p><br/><p>of this opportunity to ask about the currency rates.</p><br/><p>[Uhmm, excuse me\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Is it not enough? But this is the best I can offer\u2026]</p><br/><p>[No, though I\u2019m okay with the amount you gave, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like</p><br/><p>you to teach me!]</p><br/><p>[Eh? You\u2019re alright with this price? The-\u2026then what is it you wanted to</p><br/><p>ask?]</p><br/><p>Hm? Hnn?</p><br/><p>Judging from that reaction\u2026I was ripped off! It might have been fine to</p><br/><p>push the price a little bit.</p><br/><p>Well that\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>I felt that this captain-san was a good person, so I doubt he took advantage</p><br/><p>of me to a serious extent.</p><br/><p>[Right now, I have only a small amount of money, but not only that, I have</p><br/><p>no idea at all about the value of money and the price of commodities\u2026</p><br/><p>If possible, please teach me regarding those things! After all, being a</p><br/><p>slime, I\u2019m ignorant in these things!]</p><br/><p>My current manner of speech was totally contradicting yesterday\u2019s setting</p><br/><p>(story of a young maiden).</p><br/><p>At any rate, both us had never believed in that story in the first place, so no</p><br/><p>problem there!</p><br/><p>And so like this, we had a conversation before departure that lasted so</p><br/><p>long, that it wasn\u2019t until after eating lunch that I was ready to say, \u2018Now we</p><br/><p>depart!\u2019.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t taste anything, but nonetheless, it was a good meal.</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: Crest of Storm</p><br/><p>Titles: \u201cOne Who Controls Demons\u201d</p><br/><p>Magic:</p><br/><p>None</p><br/><p>Skills:</p><br/><p>Unique Skill \u300eGreat Sage\u300f</p><br/><p>Unique Skill \u300ePredator\u300f</p><br/><p>Slime Inherent Skills \u300eDissolution, Absorption, Self-Regeneration\u300f</p><br/><p>Extra Skill \u300eWater Manipulation\u300f</p><br/><p>Extra Skill \u300eMagic Perception\u300f</p><br/><p>Acquired Skills:</p><br/><p>Black Snake \u300eHeat Perception, Poison Mist Breath\u300f</p><br/><p>Centipede \u300eParalysis Breath\u300f</p><br/><p>Spider \u300eSticky Thread, Steel Thread\u300f</p><br/><p>Bat \u300eUltrasonic Waves\u300f</p><br/><p>Lizard \u300eBody Armor\u300f</p><br/><p>Black Wolf \u300eSuper Olfaction, Thought Transmission, Intimidation,</p><br/><p>Shadow Movement, Black Lightning\u300f</p><br/><p>Resistances:</p><br/><p>Heat Fluctuation Resistance EX</p><br/><p>Physical Attack Resistance</p><br/><p>Pain Immunity</p><br/><p>Electrical Resistance</p><br/><p>Paralysis Resistance</p><br/>\n</div>"}

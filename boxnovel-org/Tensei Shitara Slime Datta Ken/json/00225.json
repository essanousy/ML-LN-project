In my calculation, for the Four Fiends of Heavenly Commanders, that\u2019s Vega, Kagali and even Dagruel to be defeated is\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda raises his hand to stop Lucia who starts apologizing.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well. Even in my calculation too, Dagruel\u2019s defeat was not expected.</p><br/><p>The question is how to do the next move.\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino who\u2019s attacking Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s headquarters is still alive.</p><br/><p>Most of the war potentials were concentrated on this place, but it was because Dino is the one with the most passive combat capability.</p><br/><p>As for Milim\u2019s territory, there\u2019s no problem to leave it alone.</p><br/><p>Because Demon Lord Milim who was the most important issue had been obtained.</p><br/><p>He can ignore Leon\u2019s \u201cEl Dorado\u201d too.</p><br/><p>As for the reason of the attack in the first place was because he allowed Kazarim\u2019s selfishness who showed an obsession towards Leon, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s an important place.</p><br/><p>As for protecting the Heaven Gate and also cutting the source of the people\u2019s faith, it was important to destroy Holy Empire Ruberios\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The hope of the Western Countries\u2019 people was lost by telling them the annihilation of Demon Lord Rimuru.</p><br/><p>In addition to this, if he destroys the headquarters of the Western Holy Church, the people who are resisting would give up in despair.</p><br/><p>But \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(The presences of Veldora and resistance forces in various places keep giving hop to the people.)</p><br/><p>That was Velda\u2019s analysis</p><br/><p>Even for the Holy Church, it\u2019s only one of them.</p><br/><p>It seems that the network between the countries is beyond what he imagined and can\u2019t be looked down.</p><br/><p>Velda felt ironic as it was Kagurazaka Yuuki, his host, who created the organization specialized even in information transmission, that\u2019s Freedom Association.</p><br/><p>(It won\u2019t be interesting if it\u2019s not like this. Everything would end immediately once I go out, let\u2019s have them resist as much as they want.)</p><br/><p>It was more fun than he thought, Velda was satisfied. Next, \u201cWell then, what would they do?\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>In front of him is Lucia.</p><br/><p>On her right side is Milim.</p><br/><p>Kneeling down below him were the last two of the Executioners, Zero and Mai.</p><br/><p>They are his remaining war potentials.</p><br/><p>He intends to defeat every one of the Demon Lords and in reverse blame it on Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>In territorial strategy, it could be said to be his complete defeat. However, the enemy\u2019s \u201cKing\u201d that is Demon Lord Rimuru has already been destroyed.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to panic so Velda thought.</p><br/><p>Above everything else, his true and important goal is to defeat Guy Crimson and Chloe O\u2019Bell who have the possibility to be equal to him.</p><br/><p>In fact, if he destroys the strongest people in this world, it would be easy to purge the remaining forces.</p><br/><p>Currently, Guy is fighting against Chloe. Also, Velgrind is fighting against Velzard.</p><br/><p>Chloe would be free once she defeats Guy, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to point her sword at Velda due to the restriction. However, just in case, he ought to kill her together with Guy.</p><br/><p>As long those two perish, it might be possible to persuade Velgrind.</p><br/><p>Thinking so, Velda makes Lucia states her opinion.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s about time for Demon Lord Guy Crimson and even the True Hero Chloe O\u2019Bell to be exhausted.</p><br/><p>We should send all of our war potential and kill both of them.\u300d</p><br/><p>Lucia answered so without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Satisfied with her answer, Velda stands up.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood! Then, I will give new power to Zero. With this, go to Guy\u2019s place\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Before he finishes talking, Velda stopped moving.</p><br/><p>(Wait\u2026\u2026 isn\u2019t they are too easy to be read?</p><br/><p>The calculation derived by Lucia is also worrisome as everything ended up with failure.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Although Demon Lord Rimuru was killed, why there\u2019s no hesitation in that guy\u2019s subordinates\u2019 movement?</p><br/><p>Also, Veldora\u2019s action is\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>No way, he\u2019s still alive?</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, he knew that I\u2019ll be aiming at Guy and the other.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026... what I should target at, is Tempest?)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s completely unexpected from Lucia who is the strongest Manas.</p><br/><p>Although she doesn\u2019t possess Ultimate Skill\u300eWisdom Lord Raphael\u300f, Lucia\u2019s intellect is very high.</p><br/><p>And yet, the result was too unnatural.</p><br/><p>\u300cA change of plan. Attack the Monster Country Tempest. Zero, assemble all remaining troops and join Dino.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll give you this, Ultimate Skill\u300eEvil Dragon Lord Azi Dahaka\u300f, it\u2019s almost approaching its completion, accumulated more combat experience.</p><br/><p>Master it. Even Ramiris\u2019\u300eLabyrinth Creation\u300fcan be broken if you use it.</p><br/><p>Go! Trample that place and realize the birth of the new worlddestruction of this world!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs your will!\u300d</p><br/><p>Receiving Velda\u2019s command, Zero stoop up and went away.</p><br/><p>Mai too follows Zero and left the place.</p><br/><p>Only Lucia and Milim remain.</p><br/><p>Velda calmly sat on his throne and laughed a little.</p><br/><p>(If Demon Lord Rimuru is alive, there\u2019s no way he won\u2019t move when Ramiris is in danger.</p><br/><p>He will guess that I was going to aim for Guy and ChloeRook and Bishop, but he\u2019s wrong.</p><br/><p>Instead, I\u2019ll lure him out and get the checkmate in one go.)</p><br/><p>Velda was convinced that Rimuru had survived.</p><br/><p>However, as he didn\u2019t show himself, Velda predicted that he might not in perfect condition.</p><br/><p>Or maybe, he thought that Velda will move in order to end both Guy and Chloe and awaiting the opportunity to strike at such opening?</p><br/><p>Either way, Velda has seen his plan.</p><br/><p>(As long I\u2019m in this Sky Castle, I won\u2019t lose. On the contrary, I\u2019ll lure Rimuru out and put an end to him.)</p><br/><p>That was Velda\u2019s thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a checkmate, Rimuru! Well, how will you move next?\u300d</p><br/><p>The Sky Castle with only Lucia and Milim left was filled with emptiness.</p><br/><p>In this place, Velda\u2019s laughter echoed a bit.</p><br/><p>His laughter became a small signal announcing the war entered its final phase. </p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>Too damn strong\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!</p><br/><p>That Giant Ossan is so absurdly strong!!</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think that Dagruel has so much power and I\u2019d see Veldora-san fighting with full power.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu, as expected from Veldora-sama. Even I wouldn\u2019t be able to win against Demon Lord Dagruel with my body intact.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m nodding in admiration as Diablo has the same opinion as me.</p><br/><p>As I can feel his confidence from his words, I don\u2019t think that he would lose one-sidedly.</p><br/><p>However, for him competing against Veldora in strength is abnormal in the first place. Dagruel is too strong.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t notice anything that indicated Dagruel would be this strong when I met him before.</p><br/><p>Even in the fight just now, Veldora would have lost if he made a mistake.</p><br/><p>\u300aIndeed. Without the combat experience from fighting Velgrind, Veldora might have been defeated.\u300b</p><br/><p>Ciel-sensei calmly said so, but she seems have not doubted that Veldora would win.</p><br/><p>She was probably confident as Veldora\u2019s ability was strengthened by her own hands.</p><br/><p>Oh well, that confidence is justified.</p><br/><p>Veldrora\u2019s Fertile Paradox has transformed the barren desert into a great forest.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he strengthen it too much?</p><br/><p>It was refreshing seeing his usual magic experiment.</p><br/><p>This ability is too haphazard.</p><br/><p>Sacrificing the angel army who was attacking Ruminas\u2019 capital, the land which was poured with excessive energy has splendidly revived.</p><br/><p>Absurdly, it seems the angels were not allowed to resist it.</p><br/><p>The probability of success was manipulated and it seemed that resisting became impossible.</p><br/><p>Indeed, so Veldora-like. What a terrifying guy.</p><br/><p>\u300cKuaahaaahahaa! Actually, I used the magic essence completely! I want a refill.\u300d</p><br/><p>Although if he didn\u2019t come back and then demanding like this, I would think that he was such an amazing guy\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I let out a sigh like saying \u2018Good grief\u2019, and began transferring my energy to Veldora.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, the other thing is fine, but Velda won\u2019t know this place right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. Do I look like someone who will make such blunder?\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora-san is so confident.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s visible when I asked him, oh well. Let\u2019s think about it when we get exposed.</p><br/><p>Besides, Veldora-san\u2019s activity this time is a wonderful work worthy of praise.</p><br/><p>He restored the out of order ley line and corrected the distortion of that land.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, there are more cards that this side could play.</p><br/><p>He also acted skillfully not to raise Velda\u2019s suspicion.</p><br/><p>Therefore, I thought that I will let him taking a large amount of magic essence from me.</p><br/><p>Well then, it can be said that the war has completed its first stage.</p><br/><p>In Milim\u2019s place, the army lead by Karion had exterminated the angels.</p><br/><p>Gobuta was participating in the meeting in Tempest, but it seems that he return back and cooperates with Karion again.</p><br/><p>There seems to be some injured soldier from Gobuta\u2019s subordinate, but they recover immediately as a large amount of High Potion seems to be prepared beforehand.</p><br/><p>This place will be fine I guess.</p><br/><p>Even in Leon\u2019s \u201cEl Dorado\u201d, it was a real victory.</p><br/><p>While maintaining the barrier, orders were issued on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no problem in here either.</p><br/><p>With this, victory in various places except in Tempest is confirmed.</p><br/><p>However, Ciel\u2019s strategy is amazing\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>What I\u2019m really anxious about is just Gobuta\u2019s fight.</p><br/><p>But, there was insurance even for that fight. Because it included the cleaning up afterward as the Devil Lords defeated the Seraphim.</p><br/><p>In the worst case, Diablo would go and support them, but I just worried too much.</p><br/><p>As for the reinforcement request coming from Mizari, there would be danger for anyone who went there.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>\u300aBenimaru is the one who go there. Because Kazarim is related to Gelmudo\u2019s matter.\u300b </p><br/><p>Ciel said so, asserting that there was no need for me to issue orders.</p><br/><p>There were various things that make me want to go, but it can be said that everything is going as Ciel\u2019s prediction.</p><br/><p>From the moment of predicting Dagruel\u2019s betrayal, she prepared Veldora to be lurking in preparation just in case of the worst.</p><br/><p>If Veldora didn\u2019t wait for his turn, Shion and the others might not have a hard fight though\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I suspected that this might be a part of Ciel\u2019s strategy so Shion would show some growth.</p><br/><p>Well, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s like that.</p><br/><p>Although I was the one who sent Masayuki to various places, it might be just a coincidence that he happened to be there when Hinata facing her crisis.</p><br/><p>But, it seems it was Ciel\u2019s intention for the children to go to Ingrassia Kingdom. It\u2019s not surprising as Ciel knows Alice\u2019s Crisis Perception ability and incorporated it into her strategy.</p><br/><p>The proof was Kumara going together with the children as their bodyguard.</p><br/><p>What caught my eyes next is Masayuki.</p><br/><p>That guy\u2019s grasp over people\u2019s hearts seemed to be strengthened to a level that can\u2019t be taken lightly.</p><br/><p>I sincerely thought that I\u2019m glad Masayuki is my ally.</p><br/><p>However, he helped to wipe out people\u2019s anxiety in various places.</p><br/><p>The result is beyond what I intended.</p><br/><p>Regarding Masayuki, Ciel didn\u2019t modify his ability, but taking a memo of the acting coaching is Ciel\u2019s idea.</p><br/><p>As expected, Ciel had a part even in this matter too.</p><br/><p>Seen in this light, it\u2019s terrifying because I see everything is playing right above Ciel\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it\u2019s convenient for me as I want to end this war quickly.</p><br/><p>For Velda, I give you my condolences.</p><br/><p>There was nothing to say other than he has a bad opponent.</p><br/><p>Well now, how will he play his move next?</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, the battle in various places has ended with our victory, but how do you think Velda will move next?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think that he will give up in destroying the world, where will be his target next?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s, it will be the place where Guy, Miss Chloe, Veldora-sama\u2019s sisters are fighting right?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I ask him, Diablo answered so.</p><br/><p>Yes, the same opinion as me.</p><br/><p>Initially, my reason for neglecting the battle in that place is to lure out Velda.</p><br/><p>Then, we also moved and waiting for Velda\u2019s arrival or so I thought at first.</p><br/><p>\u300aPlease wait. Currently, everything is advancing just as planned. As a result, I anticipated a change in enemy\u2019s thought.</p><br/><p>Velda has doubted master\u2019s annihilation and convinced that master is alive.</p><br/><p>In other words, Velda\u2019s next plan is attacking this city.\u300b </p><br/><p>Ciel stated her opinion.</p><br/><p>I see, as expected he would feel suspicious.</p><br/><p>Because even though I should have \u2018died\u2019, my subordinates are still playing an active part in this war.</p><br/><p>If you thinking about this, even I will feel something is suspicious too. Oh well, it would be weird if you don\u2019t feel anything suspicious about it.</p><br/><p>To predict that it would be like this\u2026\u2026 As expected from Ciel-san.</p><br/><p>Normally, if I\u2019m the one who came up with the idea and executing it, the differences would be like heaven and earth\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, Velda is aiming at Tempest right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300aThat\u2019s certain.\u300b</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd, his aim is to lure out me who panicked?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300aThat\u2019s right. And perhaps, he will send his strongest forces including even anti-labyrinth.\u300b</p><br/><p>Anti-Labyrinth ability?</p><br/><p>That seems impossible.</p><br/><p>That labyrinth is an invincible area, granted with absolute immortality by Ramiris.</p><br/><p>As long as we fighting inside it, there\u2019s no way we will lose.</p><br/><p>As for the method of capturing the labyrinth, there\u2019s no other way than to destroy the creator that\u2019s Ramiris.</p><br/><p>\u300aNo. If it spreads it roots in the labyrinth, it\u2019s possible to rewrite the effect. In other words\u2015\u2015\u300b</p><br/><p>Ah, that\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ciel\u2019s explanation, I understood.</p><br/><p>Certainly, it may be possible to nullify the labyrinth with such method.</p><br/><p>If that comes true, it\u2019s likely that the final decisive battle will be done inside the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>I immediately thought about the countermeasures, also I told Benimaru who returned to Tempest about it.</p><br/><p>I want to believe that those present there, Ramiris included, will be able to deal with it later.</p><br/><p>And then, I converse with Ciel.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, it would be impossible to lure out Velda, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300aYes, I expected so. Conversely, you could say that we succeeded in confining him.\u300b </p><br/><p>Exactly as Ciel said, it can be said that Velda shut himself inside the Sky Castle.</p><br/><p>Up until now, the location of the Heaven Gate was unknown.</p><br/><p>Or rather, due to the raging magic essences in that area, \u300eMagic Power Perception\u300fcan\u2019t be activated smoothly.</p><br/><p>For a long time ago until now, the Heaven Gate has been hidden.</p><br/><p>However, with Dagruel who is the Gate protector defeated, the disorder of the magic essence was corrected.</p><br/><p>What left is only the defense mechanism of the Gate itself\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If it was before, if you aim at the gate, Velda would immediately guess your intention.</p><br/><p>And then, before you break the power defending the gate, he would put some countermeasures.</p><br/><p>But, right now.</p><br/><p>Because of Veldora\u2019s great efforts, the gate has become exposed.</p><br/><p>It would be too late for Velda when he realizes our intention as we quickly destroyed the gate and get the checkmate.</p><br/><p>An eye for an eye.</p><br/><p>As Velda is going to attack my city in order to lure me out, on the contrary, he would also get invaded.</p><br/><p>Now that we have shaved off Velda\u2019s forces, we don\u2019t need to defend all of our bases.</p><br/><p>Far from hoping for the destruction of the world, he better realize that it was a foolish idea to send his forces gradually to various place.</p><br/><p>For the next turn, it would be an attack from our side.</p><br/><p>I shall teach him that it\u2019s a mistake if he thinks that it will be his turn forever.</p><br/><p>\u300eTestarossa, Ultima, Carrerra\u2015\u2015\u300f</p><br/><p>By calling my summons, I connected to the three Devil Lords with\u300eTelepathy\u300f.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a secret line made by going directly through \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is, Rimuru-sama! You\u2019re safe after all\u2015\u2015\u300f</p><br/><p>Testarossa answered filled with emotion.</p><br/><p>I nodded and ordered those three.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou three, go destroy the Heaven Gate. Furthermore, conceal the fact that I\u2019m alive, oke?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eEven though you said so, everyone is convinced that Rimuru-sama is alive\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI have asked Benimaru about it, but oh well, just in case. It\u2019s not the time for me to appear yet, so don\u2019t say it\u2019s an order from me. Even if you are asked by other people, it\u2019s fine if you refuse and don\u2019t say my name.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300ePlease rest assured in that case. Because it\u2019s only Rimuru-sama who could order us!\u300f</p><br/><p>Saying so, Testarossa and co laugh happily.</p><br/><p>Come to think about it, those three are under my direct control.</p><br/><p>Because they won\u2019t receive an order from other people, I guess I\u2019m thinking too much.</p><br/><p>As for Benimaru, it was too late as he knows I\u2019m alive.</p><br/><p>While I was thinking of such things to hide my own embarrassment, Testarossa and other seem to have finished their preparation.</p><br/><p>And in order to execute my order to destroy the Heaven Gate, they began moving with glee.</p><br/><p>Next, the remaining problem is\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>There are people who are fighting and causing unnecessary environmental destruction on the northern continent.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it\u2019s meaningless for Guy and the others to keep fighting. I think someone has to go and mediate between them.\u300d</p><br/><p>At the moment I said so.</p><br/><p>\u300cOops, Dia\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI have the important duty as Rimuru-sama\u2019s guard. This place aside, oh Veldora-sama, please go and admonish your sisters!\u300d</p><br/><p>The victor is Diablo</p><br/><p>Veldora tried to push that role to Diablo but was brilliantly ignored.</p><br/><p>It was his utter defeat.</p><br/><p>Thus, it was decided that Veldora would go and arbitrate the quarrel between his sisters.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s expression was overflowing with sadness, but as he had taken a large amount magic essence from me, there\u2019s no need for me to feel any sympathy for him.</p><br/><p>I want him to try his best.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If we do make a new come, we should have no trouble setting the coordinates due to being connected to Rimuru\u2019s Soul Corridor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Veldora stopped as if he wanted them to ponder this.</p><br/><p>In spite of appearances, Ramiris was a quick thinker, and she realized what it was Veldora was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see! Even if we make a new gate, we can\u2019t get it to open without energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, exactly. Regardless of what we do, we need energy. And so I think the quickest method would be to release my aura and fill the ground with energy. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris nodded as if in agreement.</p><br/><p>Veldora was suggesting that he release his own aura. He had judged that with the immense amount of energy stored in his body, he could fill this world up with energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! Good thinking, master. I know that you have a shocking amount of energy inside of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 It may be possible if you do it, Lord Veldora. However, won\u2019t it be a problem if you just go around changing the laws of this world like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike the carefree Ramiris, Beretta\u2019s observation was rather sharp.</p><br/><p>And it was this point exactly, that had caused Veldora to hesitate.</p><br/><p>If Veldora released his energy, there was a high possibility that it could mess up the ecological system of this world\u2013this would be a breach of the rules that Rimuru had set in place when going to other worlds.</p><br/><p>That being said, it would also be impossible for them to return without using a gate.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s \u2018Space Transfer\u2019 would not let him travel to other worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s just me, I could just use Rimuru\u2019s \u2018Simultaneous Existence\u2019 and return by being born again over there! So it\u2019s no problem if I die here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? But doesn\u2019t that mean only you can return?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it is!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris was furious.</p><br/><p>Veldora wasn\u2019t actually serious, but this suggestion was quickly dismissed.</p><br/><p>Well, of course, it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, creating a new Different Gate will take a long time. I can prepare the necessary minerals, but I don\u2019t have enough of the other magic materials I would need. And if I had to start from scratch, well, who knows how long it would take\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 It took years just to make the prototype\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta said nonchalantly, which caused Ramiris to hold her head in frustration.</p><br/><p>In fact, there had been quite a few mishaps back when they were still testing it.</p><br/><p>And as they had no facility here, it was not very realistic for them to create an entirely new gate.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t impossible, but it was exhausting just thinking about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? And that\u2019s why I think it would be the quickest to just reactivate that thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 If that\u2019s the case, we should have used a system that required you to infuse it with energy directly, and not have it gathered from the air\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only that, the storage type required extra magic circuits, which was a huge bother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s true\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Beretta said as if suddenly remembering something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute. We don\u2019t need to panic. As the \u2018Soul Corridor\u2019 is still connected, won\u2019t Lord Rimuru notice our absence and call us back?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Veldora and Ramiris\u2019s reaction upon hearing those words\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cHahh. Oh, Beretta, you really don\u2019t understand anything. We don\u2019t want that to happen. That\u2019s why we are trying so hard to think of a solution!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo true. Don\u2019t you see? Rimuru will be angry if he finds out about what we\u2019ve been doing! And you are just as guilty. Rimuru won\u2019t return until a week at the earliest, and so we have to return and destroy the evidence before then!\u201d</p><br/><p>And so they completely rejected Beretta\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>Still, it was incredibly simple and easy for him to understand.</p><br/><p>Basically, they were frantic because they did not want to be scolded.</p><br/><p>Once he knew this, Beretta did not argue back. And so he quietly tried to think of what would be the best way to return.</p><br/><p>At this point, Beretta was fully implicated.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was just too softhearted.</p><br/><p>And so quite some time passed after that.</p><br/><p>And then finally, all three of them looked into each others\u2019 faces, but none of them had had a good idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, does that mean we can go with my idea? Then we can just move along\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no signs of intelligent life in this world. So there was no point in staying long. And it wasn\u2019t just Veldora who thought this, as Ramiris agreed with him.</p><br/><p>As for Beretta, he was just following orders now, and so had no reason to complain.</p><br/><p>He was a little worried that they might continue their experiments once they returned, but he would worry about that when the time came.</p><br/><p>Ramiris and Beretta showed their agreement, and so Veldora nodded.</p><br/><p>And then, just as he was about to release the aura he had been holding in\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2013The thunderous sound of an immense explosion overwhelmed the ground\u2019s surface, and they saw a mushroom-shaped cloud in the distance.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.\u201cHmm!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026is a sign of life\u2026and it seems like they are fighting. Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora and Ramiris looked at each other. They grinned and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur plan to return is temporarily on hold! Let\u2019s go and see what\u2019s happening!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, master! I can\u2019t wait to see what they are like!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them laughed over their shared interest in spectating.</p><br/><p>Ramiris jumped onto Veldora\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>And then the two of them, as if forgetting how depressed they had been a moment ago, began to move in the direction of the explosion.</p><br/><p>This master and apprentice were of one mind.</p><br/><p>And\u2013</p><br/><p>The abandoned Beretta sighed deeply before he started to run after them at full speed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

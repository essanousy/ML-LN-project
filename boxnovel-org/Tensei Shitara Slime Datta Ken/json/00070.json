Harvest Festival</p><br/><p>What the hell\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell\u2026 what the hell is that fiend!!!</p><br/><p>Seeing the chaotic dance of light and recognizing its danger, Reihim lay hiding inside a carriage.</p><br/><p>The monsters\u2019 city was still surrounded by the barrier, and nothing unusual was reported by his men.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 whence has this monster come from\u2026?</p><br/><p>The Saint Knight\u2019s barrier, even an inferior one, should have protected against entry from high rank monsters.</p><br/><p>At the very least, had one entered or left they would have been notified.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless\u2026</p><br/><p>With a little thought, it was clear that the monster mercilessly slaughtering his men before him cared little for things like barriers.</p><br/><p>The Blood Shadows squad he borrowed from Cardinal Nicholas dispersed into hiding and were observing the situation.</p><br/><p>As expected of them.</p><br/><p>Like Reihim, they were all pretending to be corpses.</p><br/><p>If this is how it is\u2026</p><br/><p>He lamented the inadequacy of his report.</p><br/><p>When asked regarding reinforcements, he firmly turned them down.</p><br/><p>After all, while they were declaring war on the city, they rampaged a bit and were able to cut down the only powerful demon \u2013 a woman \u2013 among them.</p><br/><p>Nor was there any retaliation.</p><br/><p>So this war should have went smoothly underneath the barrier.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the battle barriers set up by the Western Saint\u2019s Church\u2019s 1,000 division, every member of the army could be considered B ranked.</p><br/><p>At the very least, it would unimaginable for them to have to go all out.</p><br/><p>The monsters fleeing the city should have been easily exterminated by the kingdom\u2019s knight alone.</p><br/><p>So, he decided to reject Sakaguchi Hinata\u2019s offer.</p><br/><p>But, even if she had come\u2026 could she protect them against this?</p><br/><p>That suspicion filled his head, and he hastily dismissed it.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way.</p><br/><p>Sakaguchi Hinata is the strongest existence; how could she fall to a mere monster?</p><br/><p>The moment he thought that\u2026</p><br/><p>Silence enveloped the battlefield.</p><br/><p>As if freezing rain falling on his back, fear overtook his heart.</p><br/><p>What\u2026 what the hell happened?</p><br/><p>Those screaming in pain or crying out of fear\u2013why have they suddenly turned silent?</p><br/><p>At that moment,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, look\u2026 survivors\u300d</p><br/><p>Merrily saying these words was a young girl, or perhaps a young lad whose voice is yet to change.</p><br/><p>Survivors\u2026 she says?</p><br/><p>But before he could realize that the words were directed at him and the blood shadows\u2026</p><br/><p>He felt an intense pain coursing through his body.</p><br/><p>When both of his arms and legs were cleanly burned off, he finally beheld that demonic fiend.</p><br/><p>At this point, he could no longer run away, nor retaliate.</p><br/><p>All Reihim could do was pray to his god\u2026</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Unique Skill\u300eHeartless One\u300f\u2026 huh.</p><br/><p>Nah\u2026 I am pretty heartless, tee hee~!</p><br/><p>Fear towards me is one thing, but when their hearts break I can activate the skill.</p><br/><p>In other words, at that moment, my enemies souls are in the palm of my hand.</p><br/><p>They live and die by my will alone.</p><br/><p>Even if I let them go, should they choose to rebel again I can erase them that very moment.</p><br/><p>And as this field trial has shown, it works even on enemies who are escaping.</p><br/><p>It targets anyone I recognize as an enemy. In this case, the entire army I saw from the sky was target.</p><br/><p>I had intended a complete genocide, yes; but even so, I had expected a few of them to run away. Well, thanks to\u300eHeartless One\u300f, problem solved.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think I could put the skill to use, but I guess I can.</p><br/><p>It is certainly one desired by rulers who intend to rule with fear.</p><br/><p>In the future, all I have to do to end a conflict is to break my enemies\u2019 spirit.</p><br/><p>Oops,\u300eMagic Perception\u300fis picking up something. 13 men.</p><br/><p>The fact that they survived means their spirits aren\u2019t broken yet.</p><br/><p>Of course, that excludes the king.</p><br/><p>13 people still intending to fight.</p><br/><p>Could any of them perhaps belong to the blood shadows who attacked the city?</p><br/><p>For now, to prevent escape, let\u2019s burn their feet off with Megiddo.</p><br/><p>By the way, that.</p><br/><p>There are many \u201cpeople\u201d whose legs I blown off, hands I burned off, or heads I pierced.</p><br/><p>In short, they are a very scattered bunch.</p><br/><p>My\u2026 what should I do?\u300eMagic Perception\u300fis getting overloaded, and I am beginning to feel dizzy!</p><br/><p>Ah, I did hear that evolution was about to start, so I guess I\u2019m going to lose my consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u300cRanga, are you there?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy, I await your command, my master!\u300d</p><br/><p>There he is.</p><br/><p>Ranga jumped out from within my shadow.</p><br/><p>Without intending to hinder me, but in case something unforeseen happened, he was on standby.</p><br/><p>Good,</p><br/><p>\u300cRanga, gather up this filth and bring them into the city.</p><br/><p>Do not kill them.</p><br/><p>I am returning there ahead of time, I\u2019ll let Youmu know, so hand them over to him\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about those who have escaped?\u300d</p><br/><p>I thought for a minute.</p><br/><p>Three men escaped. Normally, Ranga would easily be able to win, but they are at least A ranked.</p><br/><p>If they work together, it might be dangerous to send Ranga out alone.</p><br/><p>But, I have no desire to let them go.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll send someone else after them.</p><br/><p>Upon capture, I\u2019ll leave them at your disposal\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! I live to serve!\u300d</p><br/><p>Confirming Ranga\u2019s answer, as if taking a break, I began gathering my power.</p><br/><p>And, started\u3008High Demon Summoning\u3009ritual.</p><br/><p>As an offering, I will use the corpses under my feet.</p><br/><p>I had considered eating them, but I doubt there are any useful abilities among them.</p><br/><p>The Blood Shadows will have to suffice.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what kind of demon I will summon, but, considering that it probably won\u2019t be able to materialize, as long as it\u2019s of some use, I\u2019ll be happy.</p><br/><p>That is, as long as it can hunt down escaping fools.</p><br/><p>\u300cI prepared thy meal, come forth, demon.</p><br/><p>And serve me!\u300d</p><br/><p>What appropriate words I now choose!</p><br/><p>I wonder if the demons will be satisfied with the offering.</p><br/><p>Just as I was thinking that, three demons appeared.</p><br/><p>Considering the past Greater Demon, which was rank A-, they are inferior compared to Blood Shadow troops.</p><br/><p>With that in mind, I had intended to summon 30 of them, but only managed three.</p><br/><p>Hey, hey, are you telling me 15 thousand corpses were worth only this much? Well, I did devour their souls, so maybe\u2026</p><br/><p>No good, since coming to this world this is the first time I\u2019m feeling such intense desire to sleep; my head is spinning.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, you guys, there are three escaping fools. Capture them alive and bring them to my subordinate Ranga.\u300d</p><br/><p>I said as the dizziness became unbearable and I became to lose my consciousness.</p><br/><p>I must reach somewhere safe!</p><br/><p>The demons behind me,</p><br/><p>\u300cWe are honored to receive our first order. This grand offering you have bestowed upon us fills our hearts with endless joy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2019Tis but an easy task, oh forth-coming Dark Lord! Can we expect to be later put to use by You?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026..\u300d</p><br/><p>They expressed such a greeting, but my consciousness was quickly waning.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe shall talk later. First, prove that you can be put to use. Go!\u300d</p><br/><p>I said and transferred back to Tempest.</p><br/><p>To bypass the barrier I had prepared a magic circle in advance\u2013it worked.</p><br/><p>Benimaru rushed over to me so I had him take a message for Youmu.</p><br/><p>And, sitting down at the place we prepared before hand, I lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>That deep sleep I fell into was the first time I was completely unconscious since coming to this world.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>When Rimuru had gone off to battle, the city split between those who worked to keep up the barrier and those who were on their knees praying.</p><br/><p>The former gathered in the center.</p><br/><p>Since the barrier dispels magic energy, they worked hard to increase it even a little bit.</p><br/><p>Everyone was busy dutifully fulfilling their roles.</p><br/><p>In the center lay the bodies of Shion and the others, preserved by a barrier.</p><br/><p>In the very center stood the magic circle Rimuru had prepared, and shrine they had built to welcome the coming of a new demon lord.</p><br/><p>Surrounding all this was the group maintaining the barrier.</p><br/><p>Shuna was among them too, along with Myulan who volunteered to help.</p><br/><p>Shuna thought,</p><br/><p>Rimuru seemed to worry about the fact that he used to be a human, but that was but a trivial fact.</p><br/><p>For Shuna, all that mattered was a connection to her partner\u2019s soul which would put her mind at ease.</p><br/><p>It willed her endless euphoria and complete satisfaction.</p><br/><p>If she were to lose Rimuru, she would definitely go mad.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama\u2026 we would be happy even if we had perished, as long as you continued living.</p><br/><p>But, Rimuru-sama, losing even one of us throws your soul into such discord\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She murmured.</p><br/><p>Benimaru nodded at these words showing his complete consent.</p><br/><p>It is possible for the kindhearted Rimuru\u2019s character to change during his transformation.</p><br/><p>If so,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen you become a demon lord, please spare us a violent character\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>They prayed for this not to pass.</p><br/><p>Benimaru, Souei, Hakurou, and Kurobee were on standby.</p><br/><p>By Rimuru\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>That should he turn into a mindless beast (demon lord), that they dispose of him quickly.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the only outcome they hoped to prevent.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re always sleeping, Shion\u2026 wake up already.\u300d</p><br/><p>That whisper was more of a prayer than anything.</p><br/><p>The one they prayed to was not any god, but a single monster.</p><br/><p>One who had never betrayed their expectations and who would certainly deliver again.</p><br/><p>So they believed.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. Individual: Rimuru Tempest, the transformation into Demon Lord \u201cHarvest Festival\u201d shall now commence. Upon its completion, related monsters shall be blessed with a gift\u226b</p><br/><p>Every monster that had gathered in the city heard the \u201cVoice of the World\u201d.</p><br/><p>Seems that Rimuru was successful at destroying the invading force.</p><br/><p>In that case, it is now their time to shine.</p><br/><p>\u300cBrace yourselves! Our master has emerged victorious. It is our turn now!\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru\u2019s voice resounded throughout the city.</p><br/><p>The city came alive.</p><br/><p>Rimuru could not have been crushed by losing Shion.</p><br/><p>And, as planned, Rimuru will be returning.</p><br/><p>As ordered, they were to let Rimuru rest.</p><br/><p>Upon reuniting, they decided on a code.</p><br/><p>Just in case Rimuru had showed up as a mere beast.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then,\u300eHow\u2019s Shion\u2019s cooking&gt;?\u300fI ask\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGot it.\u300eIt\u2019s horrible\u300fis the response? Who the hell thought up this crap\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Rimuru sleepily said.</p><br/><p>His head no longer spinning out of drowsiness, he muttered the complaint with little force behind it.</p><br/><p>The one who had thought of it was Benimaru, of course.</p><br/><p>He had not forgotten that she had forced a new recipe on him before.</p><br/><p>So if she were to wake up with a complaint\u2026 yet another wish he made to Rimuru.</p><br/><p>If only things went according to plan.</p><br/><p>Benimaru and the rest desperately worked to bring the plan to fruition, completely forgetting the world\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>That gifts were coming to them was completely out of their minds,</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Rimuru fell into deep slumber.</p><br/><p>His consciousness slipping from his fingers, he could no longer maintain the human form and reverted to being a slime.</p><br/><p>Failing to reach the darkness he was in,</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement.

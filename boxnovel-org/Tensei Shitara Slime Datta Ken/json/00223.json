Pain ran through Arios\u2019 arm.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaa, serve you right~! Luckily, two of it stuck in right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Venom pointed it out and sprouting a smile.</p><br/><p>As what Venom said, two claws had stuck in Arios\u2019 arm. </p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard, is this your aim from the start?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNope, it isn\u2019t like that. I thought I\u2019d kill you by the first strike.</p><br/><p>However, I thought that even if you grazed by one would be good. Well. I\u2019m so lucky again today.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou jester\u2015\u2015 I will no longer hold back then.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStupid~! Fighting without holding back from the beginning, such a thing should be the basic you know!\u300d</p><br/><p>Towards Arios who was dyed with anger, Venom was thoughtfully cheerful.</p><br/><p>However, in contrast to his attitude, there\u2019s no gap in his stance. With his cut claws already regenerated, Venom\u2019s consciousness focused on Arios.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s natural.</p><br/><p>From the exchange just now, Venom was convinced that Arios was an overwhelmingly powerful person.</p><br/><p>(Hee! As I expected, there\u2019s something that I can\u2019t perceive even inside of where my surveillance are.</p><br/><p>Certainly, he\u2019s higher ranking than me\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019s not because he\u2019s fast that I can\u2019t see his movement.</p><br/><p>That means that it was due to his ability that I can\u2019t detect him from the start, I\u2019m sure my thinking isn\u2019t wrong\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>He\u2019s stronger than me, no doubt about it, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t win.</p><br/><p>In that case, it\u2019s so convenient. I will kill this guy and take that power!)</p><br/><p>While fighting, Venom felt laughter almost spilled out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Even if he defeats low ranking enemies, he can\u2019t obtain more power.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he thought this time was a chance for him. It\u2019s a chance for him to defeat a high ranked enemy and obtained more power.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019m lucky. Masayuki is here, this guy will become a high-quality food for me!)</p><br/><p>If Arios\u2019 strength is comparable to the high ranking people of Rimuru\u2019s closest aides\u2015\u2015That\u2019s on Diablo\u2019s class\u2015\u2015 and if Arios has an isolation ability, Venom would have no chance to win.</p><br/><p>But, Venom noticed that Arios has no such ability.</p><br/><p>Now that Venom was able to percept Arios\u2019 movement, it probably meant that he couldn\u2019t use that ability.</p><br/><p>Arios was not an unreachable existence, Venom concluded so.</p><br/><p>Currently, Masayuki\u2019s ability had increased Venom\u2019s luck.</p><br/><p>It also exerted another effect on Venom, his strength increased unbelievably.</p><br/><p>He can evade an inevitable attack for some reason, and attack that unlikely to hit was able to hit.</p><br/><p>The evidence was the two poison claws stuck on Arios before.</p><br/><p>In this lucky state, he believes that poison that shouldn\u2019t work will have an effect.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s so, there\u2019s no need to hesitate.</p><br/><p>Venom believed in himself and Masayuki, and was going to challenge Arios who\u2019s stronger.</p><br/><p>Masayuki stands with his arms folded while watching Venom\u2019s fight.</p><br/><p>Honestly, rather than looking at it, he can understand the fight to some extent from the sparks that occurs once in a while.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not a speed that can be followed by eyes, Masayuki\u2019s just pretending that he\u2019s watching.</p><br/><p>(Or rather, I can\u2019t do anything like that you know.)</p><br/><p>Because it\u2019s no longer inside his area of understanding, the feeling of fear has weakened.</p><br/><p>Since Masayuki decided to entrust the fight completely to Venom, Masayuki thinks about what\u2019s going to happen later.</p><br/><p>The most important thing for Masayuki is his own safety.</p><br/><p>The children seem to wait for their chance to take part in the fight, and eagerly watching the fight between Venom and Arios.</p><br/><p>Turning his gaze to the children, Masayuki ponders.</p><br/><p>(They are stronger than me. If that\u2019s so, I think it would be safer together\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Or rather, why are they here?)</p><br/><p>Masayuki finally feels the doubt about it.</p><br/><p>When Masayuki comes to the capital, the children had already saved Hinata from the crisis.</p><br/><p>Masayuki appeared at a good timing, in a favorable place, but he never aimed for that.</p><br/><p>It just happened that the timing match with his arrival with his companions by Venom\u2019s transfer magic.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like they had acted together till then.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Kenya! Why are you guys here?\u300d</p><br/><p>Although it\u2019s too late, Masayuki asks Kenya.</p><br/><p>Masayuki\u2019s behavior was too natural, like not thinking about the fight\u2015\u2015Although saying that he\u2019s ignoring as he can\u2019t see the fight won\u2019t be wrong\u2015\u2015in the people\u2019s eyes, but he didn\u2019t notice it.</p><br/><p>He felt he needs to ask the question for his safety later on.</p><br/><p>He wanted to withdraw from this dangerous place quickly, but he thought that he needs a reason for that.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, An-chan[2]. Actually, Alice is\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUhhh, with my ability\u300ePerceiver (Space Wiseman)[3]\u300f, I somehow know that danger is approaching Hinata Onee-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause Alice makes a racket, we somehow do it\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFor that reason, we came to help Hinata-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe got stronger thanks to Hakurou-shishou and Agera-Shishou\u2019s training you know!</p><br/><p>Right now we might not lose to Masayuki An-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>So, the children answer Masayuki\u2019s question together.</p><br/><p>(What are they saying\u2026\u2026 From the start, they were stronger you know\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>While thinking so, Masayuki consents with \u201cI see\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, I didn\u2019t think that you guys would be here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe too, we didn\u2019t think that An-chan would come.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. But, if you didn\u2019t come Hinata Onee-chan might have been killed\u2026\u2026 Onii-chan, thank you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh!? Ah, I guess so. Well, no need to worry if I\u2019m here.\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki feels the sweats flowing on his back increased to the unexpected overestimation.</p><br/><p>Aside from that\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Apparently, Masayuki concludes that the enemy\u2019s aim certainly to be Hinata.</p><br/><p>(Well, what should I do? The enemy is aiming for Hinata-san, but I\u2019m near her so I would be in danger too\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Masayuki thought so, but the children said that they came here to protect Hinata.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d like to run away with transfer magic but Venom is fighting, it was difficult to run away from this place.</p><br/><p>Although the enemy seems not going to interfere with the city and the citizens, the damage seemed to be massive due to stray attacks.</p><br/><p>While thinking so, Masayuki draws a conclusion that the safest place is next to Hinata who the children will protect. </p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, then I\u2019ll be next to Hinata-san. Because I\u2019ll protect you in case of something up.\u300d</p><br/><p>Standing naturally next to Hinata, Masayuki spoke without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>But, that\u2019s not the only reason.</p><br/><p>Masayuki had something he wants to protect above all else.</p><br/><p>The warmth left in his right hand \u2015\u2015 that\u2019s right, the memory of the warmth and softness of Hinata\u2019s breast.</p><br/><p>(Losing such wonderful things, I will never allow it!)</p><br/><p>With Masayuki\u2019s intense determination, the effect of his ability increased to the maximum.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015While it\u2019s a Unique Skill, it\u2019s enough to reach the truth of the world.</p><br/><p>As the result, the space called Lucky Field[4] which gives tremendous blessing to people Masayuki considers as ally expanded, that\u2019s unintended by Masayuki.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm, as expected that angel-like guy is beyond my capabilities\u2026.. I can barely follow the movements.</p><br/><p>Compared to that, your friend is amazing. He can somehow fight against that guy\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Truly amazing\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata nods to Masayuki\u2019s word.</p><br/><p>And then she continues,</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, let\u2019s us do the thing that we can do now.</p><br/><p>I think that will be helping the people escape from this place.</p><br/><p>Nicholas, we will spread defense barrier in this place!</p><br/><p>Sealing the aftereffect of that fight, it will become the people\u2019s shield!\u300d</p><br/><p>She shouts with vigor.</p><br/><p>Based on that Girl\u2019s belief, Hinata started to do what can be done now.</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t think of an outrageous thing such as she wanted to save everyone, but helping people that need help in front of her \u2015\u2015 that\u2019s the way Hinata lived.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the thing that led to confidence, Hinata understood that well.</p><br/><p>\u300cWith pleasure!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood, Hinata-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u200c\u300cLeave it to me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Responding to her are Nicholas, Leonard and Fritz.</p><br/><p>Following Hinata\u2019s orders, the three ran to three sides. And then, a square with Hinata as the top is formed.</p><br/><p>And so, with 4 holy knight class people, the defense barrier was spread.</p><br/><p>Holy Field will be effective if the enemy is a monster, but this time there\u2019s Venom here and the enemy has the appearance of an angel.</p><br/><p>If they\u2019re carelessly put holy attribute barrier, it will be a hindrance instead.</p><br/><p>With that in mind, they chose Material Shield (Holy and Magic Defense Barrier).</p><br/><p>It was a barrier with the purpose to block explosion impact, heat etc, that\u2019s all elements.</p><br/><p>Thus, Hinata plans to temporarily earn some time for the people to escape.</p><br/><p>In align with Hinata\u2019s action,</p><br/><p>\u300cHinata onee-chan! We\u2019ll also help!\u300d</p><br/><p>Alice said so and synchronized the effect of Space Barrier of Unique Skill\u300ePerceiver\u300f with Hinata and co\u2019s barrier.</p><br/><p>As the result, the Material Shield deployed by Hinata and co was reinforced greatly.</p><br/><p>Looking at that, Gale went out ahead.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I think my Unique Skill\u300eCultivator (Reclamator)[5]\u300fwill be useful!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gale\u2019s Unique Skill\u300eCultivator\u300fwas originally an ability suitable for agriculture, but depending on how to use it, it was an excellent ability with various applications.</p><br/><p>Interfering with the earth, Gale covers the plaza on the people side with soils that turned hard.</p><br/><p>Gale synchronized with the spirit of earth, on that moment a protective wall as strong as steel was completed.</p><br/><p>A wall instantly appeared in front of the people. Naturally, the people were shaken.</p><br/><p>After Gale are Kenya and Ryouta.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlrighty! We will knock down that guy.</p><br/><p>My eyes have gradually accustomed and become able to see that guy\u2019s movement.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think Masayuki An-chan\u2019s turn will come!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re also quite trained.</p><br/><p>However, it\u2019s reassuring that Masayuki-san is watching us!\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying such words, Kenya and Ryouta participated in the fight.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh. When it\u2019s dangerous, I\u2019ll protect you both!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kenya and Ryouta replied with a nod.</p><br/><p>(I never decided so though.)</p><br/><p>So Masayuki thought. </p><br/><p>As it becomes like this, Masayuki has no other choice but to believe that Venom and the children will defeat the enemy.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a miscalculation for Masayuki that Kenya and Ryouta participated in the fight.</p><br/><p>He thought that they will keep protecting Hinata.</p><br/><p>However, the cornerstone of the defense, that\u2019s Gale and Alice are still here.</p><br/><p>Hinata and co\u2019s barrier seems to have been reinforced, although it\u2019s not going as Masayuki has planned originally, his safety is secured for the time being.</p><br/><p>(Hmm. Like this, it would be better not to make an unnecessary move.)</p><br/><p>Masayuki made a decision and decided to deal with the remaining trouble quickly.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the gaze of the people around the place.</p><br/><p>Because Masayuki is Masayuki, he wants the people to go somewhere quickly.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone, please calm down and leave the plaza! If there\u2019s a place where you can take refuge in\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki is trying to keep the people away while showing his cool side to Hinata.</p><br/><p>His plan is one.</p><br/><p>When the situation turns worst, he will run away.</p><br/><p>He thought that to make it easy for him to escape at any times, having fewer people here is better.</p><br/><p>However, the people received his words in another meaning.</p><br/><p>\u300cHero-sama, he is worried about us\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIdiot, it\u2019s different! We are in his way. If he\u2019s fighting seriously, we\u2019ll get involved!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? So that\u2019s why he let the small apprentices fight\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. If Masayuki-sama himself fights, there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019ll win.</p><br/><p>But then, we will get hurt too!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re hindrances to him!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, like that.</p><br/><p>Naturally, they misunderstood Masayuki\u2019s true motive. </p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone, please run to the royal castle. There\u2019s a large-scale barrier set up in that place.</p><br/><p>Although the angel\u2019s army will come to attack it, it will take time for the barrier to break.</p><br/><p>In order to let Hero-dono to fight freely, a smooth evacuation will be better\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>A man suggested so towards the people who try to flee from the plaza.</p><br/><p>That man is Prince Elrick who confessed his own crime.</p><br/><p>His face is like someone who had been released from evil spirit\u2019s grasp, his eyes are of a person who prepared and decide to accept anything.</p><br/><p>\u300cPrince\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Even the knights are surprised for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone! Did you hear it? Please move calmly, there\u2019s enough space for everyone in the castle.</p><br/><p>So there\u2019s no one injured by panic, please leave this place calmly.</p><br/><p>Leave the rest to Hero-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>One of the knights issued instructions to the people with a large voice.</p><br/><p>And then that knight ordered to the soldiers who were bewildered by the turn of the events to guide the populace and prepare to receive them in the castle.</p><br/><p>Apparently, the man was the Knight Order\u2019s vice leader, receiving the order the knights promptly started to move.</p><br/><p>Attached to them, the soldiers also began to move.</p><br/><p>People began moving like water from the plaza.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to evacuate quickly so Masayuki-sama will be able to actively taking part in the fight\u201d with that in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Thus, there were only a few people left in this place.</p><br/><p>[1] (\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30cd\u30df\u30fc) Messatsu Bundan Ha (D\u016bmu enem\u012b), the kanji means Annihilating Dividing Crush/Tear.</p><br/><p>[2] It\u2019s a contraction from Ani (Elder brother).

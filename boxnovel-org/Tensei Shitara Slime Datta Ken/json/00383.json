Did you turn your power off?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course. These hidden cyborg features sure are useful.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Good! Now let\u2019s go and find the Powered Suits.\u2019</p><br/><p>They said through Thought Transmission.</p><br/><p>In regards to the search, Karman and his men had an idea of how to go about it.</p><br/><p>As the machines could be controlled remotely, each of them were connected to their machines through a special \u2018thought wave.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no guarantee that it would still work, but they had hope.</p><br/><p>And so they hid and worked quietly.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Jegyll and her men\u2026</p><br/><p>They were struggling against the pack of Super Beasts.</p><br/><p>Had the ship still been intact, they would not have been attacked by the beasts.</p><br/><p>And even if they were, the thing had a high power beam cannon installed. And so they wouldn\u2019t have had much trouble in dealing with the enemy.</p><br/><p>However, Jegyll and her men had no such weapons.</p><br/><p>Of course, Bionoids had tremendous strength as anti-cyborg weapons, but they had no methods of attack that covered a wide area. That was their weakness.</p><br/><p>The plasma cannon was used against single human enemies. It could not deal a lethal blow to a Super Beast.</p><br/><p>The Super Beasts\u2019 ability to regenerate was too strong.</p><br/><p>While the Bionoids would now lose, it would take a very long time to kill all of the Super Beasts.</p><br/><p>Jegyll understood this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being hindered by mere purification devices!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll shouted as she kicked the head of one Super Beast. Then she fired off a round of plasma bullets that were a meter in diameter.</p><br/><p>Jegyll and Reiz had enough firepower to kill them.</p><br/><p>And so eventually, they used the other men as bait, and then Jegyll and Reiz would attack.</p><br/><p>Even while they fought, Jegyll\u2019s eyes were searching for Karman and the others.</p><br/><p>While they had disappeared behind the remains of the ship, she had not given up the chase.</p><br/><p>These wastelands were filled with rocks and cliffs. With enough time, they might actually be able to escape.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine they would live for very long without being able to receive maintenance or replenish their energy. There was no way they could communicate with others either. Still, she could not underestimate how tenacious Karman and his men were.</p><br/><p>They were seasoned warriors and she could not allow them to run free. That was Jegyll\u2019s decision.</p><br/><p>She was annoyed.</p><br/><p>As she was based on a human, she still had emotions.</p><br/><p>However, not to the point where it would affect the mission.</p><br/><p>That was a feature of Bionoids.</p><br/><p>And so Jegyll dealt with the Super Beasts calmly and systematically. She would follow Karman when they were done.</p><br/><p>Karman had realized this.</p><br/><p>He had left the search to his men while he watched the battlefield.</p><br/><p>As he and his men used \u2018Vision Link,\u2019 he had a wide range of sight.</p><br/><p>It was an unbelievable feature, but Karman was able to use it without hesitation.</p><br/><p>That was the difference between him and Zaza.</p><br/><p>Karman did not worry or think too hard about everything.</p><br/><p>And in Karman\u2019s vision, was a very familiar monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat one\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He muttered under his breath so no one else could hear.</p><br/><p>A great serpent with a red head.</p><br/><p>The one that Veldora had defeated. It had become humanoid after that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Continue the search. I have some minor business to attend to.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Captain?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Surely you don\u2019t mean to\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s too dangerous!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Shouldn\u2019t you hide here quietly!?\u2019</p><br/><p>As his men could see what he was looking at, they had an idea of what he was going to do.</p><br/><p>They frantically tried to stop him, but Karman shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018You may be right. But I can\u2019t abandon that one. After all, what if\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>What if that Super Beast had been his lover?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t say it, but Karman\u2019s resolve was strong.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026I\u2019m leaving the rest to you!\u2019</p><br/><p>Karman told them before rushing out.</p><br/><p>He went around so that the enemy could not locate him. Then he disappeared into the shadow of some rocks.</p><br/><p>His men quickly pulled themselves together and returned to their work.</p><br/><p>They would do what they could at the moment. That was the only way to get out of this danger.</p><br/><p>Then, just as Jegyll had created a great sphere of plasma and was about to unleash it at the head of the great serpent\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Karman jumped out and blocked it with his Ether Ring Barrier.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Karman\u2019s arrival was very sudden, but Jegyll was not phased.</p><br/><p>Reiz was the same. His reaction suggested he had anticipated this.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk. I thought you might be a little surprised\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman joked. Jegyll snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. As if I wouldn\u2019t notice you when you are so close by. We were also looking at you all along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you know what did surprise me? That you would try and protect a Super Beast. A tool. A mere purification device. I thought you were going to launch a surprise attack. But well, you did ruin my attack just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll had known that Karman was approaching.</p><br/><p>And so Reiz had intended on shooting Karman while he was targeting Jegyll.</p><br/><p>It would be difficult to follow and shoot someone who was moving faster than the speed of sound. And so he had to predict where Karman would move and shoot in advance. And he had predicted wrongly.</p><br/><p>Karman hadn\u2019t gone for Jegyll. Instead, he had protected the Super Beast. Even Reiz could not have foreseen that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh. Sorry about that. But I have my reasons too. I swore to protect my lover. And I don\u2019t want to break my promise ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this, the great serpent with the red head seemed to react.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t much. In fact, no one even noticed it. But it was almost as if it understood Karman\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>But Jegyll, on the other hand, did not understand Karman at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? What does that have to do with this Super Beast over here?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

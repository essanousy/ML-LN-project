Veldora</p><br/><p>The moment I ordered\u300eWisdom King Raphael\u300fto release Veldora, I felt an energy storm rage within me.</p><br/><p>I felt a soul of overwhelming power be released.</p><br/><p>(I am reborn!!!)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t you sound weird? I wanted to retort, but abstained and,</p><br/><p>(Yo! It\u2019s been a while, how have you been?)</p><br/><p>I offer a light greeting.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 What\u2019s with that\u2026 I\u2019m back and such a lousy greeting\u2026</p><br/><p>But that was quicker than expected. I had thought it\u2019d be a while longer)</p><br/><p>(Nope!\u300eInfinite Prison\u300fdid take a while, though.</p><br/><p>Had my\u300eGreat Sage\u300fskill not evolved, it\u2019d take another hundred years.</p><br/><p>(Well, my unique skill\u300eInvestigator\u300fhas also been analyzing the prison.</p><br/><p>Sadly, as it was sealed inside, I couldn\u2019t send\u300eGreat Sage\u300fthe report.</p><br/><p>How absurdly strong it was,\u300eInfinite Prison\u300f! As expected of a hero.</p><br/><p>By the way, what\u2019s with the skills evolving?)</p><br/><p>Veldora asked and I began the explanation.</p><br/><p>My transformation into a demon lord made my unique skills evolve into ultimate skills.</p><br/><p>\u300eGreat Sage\u300fhad become\u300eRaphael\u300fand its analytical abilities greatly increased.</p><br/><p>(Hoho, so that\u2019s how it was. Oh, and you became a demon lord in less than a year!</p><br/><p>Unlike those fakes, awakened demon lords are really strong, you know!</p><br/><p>(Well! Who would\u2019ve known! Could I be a genius?</p><br/><p>I was the strongest slime around since birth though, jeez.</p><br/><p>That much is a given, no?)</p><br/><p>(Are you an idiot? Doing such absurd things. Indeed, I have felt you drawing out absurd amounts of magical energy once in a while.</p><br/><p>And then going around naming people left and right\u2026 you do know that whenever you didn\u2019t have enough energy it came from me, right?</p><br/><p>What a ridiculous guy.</p><br/><p>I thought that by having my energy taken by you would extend the imprisonment, but who would have thought you\u2019d shorten it by evolving.</p><br/><p>Very unexpected, I must say!)</p><br/><p>Eh? So the reason I was fine naming everyone was because of Veldora?</p><br/><p>Never once did I think that the risk-free evolution I was witnessing was strange.</p><br/><p>I guess I can\u2019t be naming people as recklessly anymore.</p><br/><p>I see\u2026 now I understand why the demon lords don\u2019t just quickly increase the number of their followers.</p><br/><p>Well, this late in the game, let\u2019s just say that everything went according to plan.</p><br/><p>(Yeah? I planned this all, though (a blatant lie)!</p><br/><p>By the way, did a gift reach you?</p><br/><p>The demon lord evolution mentioned something about gifts given to everyone I was linked to)</p><br/><p>He made an incredulous face.</p><br/><p>And thinking for a second,</p><br/><p>(Ooooh! So that\u2019s the skill evolution!</p><br/><p>My unique skill\u300eInvestigator\u300fevolved into ultimate skill\u300eInvestigation King Faust\u300f.</p><br/><p>Recognizing my inquisitive spirit, I was granted path to the ultimate truth!)</p><br/><p>He is very excited.</p><br/><p>Just as he looks, he\u2019s quite an airhead I guess.</p><br/><p>Though that\u2019s perfectly fine.</p><br/><p>To the greatly elated Veldora,</p><br/><p>(Good for you, I guess. Skill evolution happens unexpectedly often, right?)</p><br/><p>I ask,</p><br/><p>(Fool! I didn\u2019t expect such a thing to happen for a few thousand years.</p><br/><p>Well, since those who\u2019ve experienced it don\u2019t go boasting about it, it\u2019s more of a secret than anything.</p><br/><p>You have experienced something truly precious!)</p><br/><p>He responded.</p><br/><p>I mean, yeah, considering that demon lords don\u2019t just awaken every day, it would be a pretty rare occurrence.</p><br/><p>I do want to continue talking for a while longer, but Veldora is probably itching to go outside.</p><br/><p>But I worry whether it will be fine.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s being traced by the Church\u2019s magic, after all.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t they find out the moment he exists?</p><br/><p>(Hey, now that we cracked the seal and you have been reborn, will you go outside?</p><br/><p>But, the problem is, you leak so much aura that everyone will find out soon I think\u2026)</p><br/><p>(Would you be troubled if they did?)</p><br/><p>Yes.</p><br/><p>I wanted to jokingly say but,</p><br/><p>Would I be troubled\u2026 Nope, not in the slightest, I think?</p><br/><p>If anything does happen I can always depend on Veldora.</p><br/><p>(Nope; if I think about it, it doesn\u2019t trouble me that much.</p><br/><p>So, as a medium, how about you use one of my clones?)</p><br/><p>I offered and, creating a clone, moved the Veldora\u2019s consciousness to it.</p><br/><p>Thus releasing him from my stomach.</p><br/><p>I and my beautiful clone.</p><br/><p>The only difference is its hair has now turned platinum.</p><br/><p>Is what I thought\u2026</p><br/><p>It suddenly started to grow, reaching 2 meters. And, the body turned firm, the face masculine.</p><br/><p>Only my general facial features remained. He has become a good looking young man.</p><br/><p>In short, this is how I would look if I made myself look like a guy. So I thought.</p><br/><p>As I thought, he\u2019s a complete battle maniac. Taking on an easy to fight in yet intimidating form.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t turn into a giant dragon, and I almost expected him to do so.</p><br/><p>(Kuahahaha! I have obtained the strongest power! All who disobey shall die!!!)</p><br/><p>And other such lines, Veldora said trying to appear like a stereotypical villain.</p><br/><p>By the way, I remember that line. A boss in my favorite manga said it.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey\u2026 old geezer. How do you know that line?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahahaha! The thing is, I was bored so I decided to analyze and read your memories!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! You do know that doing such a pointless thing delayed the analysis, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026..Eh?\u300d</p><br/><p>We were looking each other in the eye.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, I doubt there was anything pleasant in those memories.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat aside. You\u2019ve released me, you have my thanks!\u300d</p><br/><p>He lowered his eyes and redirected the conversation.</p><br/><p>At that moment,</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. I have obtained two important pieces of information\u226b</p><br/><p>Raphael said.</p><br/><p>This is what he reported,</p><br/><p>\u226aFirst, the establishment of a \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d with the individual: Veldora has been confirmed.</p><br/><p>Individual: Veldora has been analyzed and the ultimate skill\u300eStorm King Veldora\u300fhas been acquired.</p><br/><p>The effects of ultimate skill\u300eStorm King Veldora\u300fare as follows.</p><br/><p>Storm Dragon Summon: The ability to summon Veldora in his dragon form.</p><br/><p>\u203bDepending on the amount of magical energy allocated, the summoning time is reduced.</p><br/><p>Storm Dragon Release: The ability to have Individual: Veldora use a clone.</p><br/><p>\u203bEven in the case of death, memory recovery is possible.</p><br/><p>Storm Dragon Magic Archive: The ability to use \u201cDeath Heralding Winds\u201d, \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d, and \u201cStorm of Destruction\u201d</p><br/><p>As described above.</p><br/><p>Currently in use, the Storm Dragon Release has no time limit.</p><br/><p>However, in current state, other skills of\u300eStorm King Veldora\u300fcannot be used\u226b</p><br/><p>Another bombshell announcement.</p><br/><p>Are you kidding me\u2026</p><br/><p>I relate the information to Veldora,</p><br/><p>\u300cA \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d, huh. So all my memories will transcend time and space and are accumulated within you.</p><br/><p>So, in other words, as long as you exist, I am immortal.</p><br/><p>Even if I am again sealed in an Infinite Prison, all you have to do is to cancel the summon.</p><br/><p>I mean, I always was nearly invincible, but now I\u2019m immortal as well\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, that is assuming I continue living.</p><br/><p>Seriously, what a terrifying tale this has become.</p><br/><p>Imagine if someone attacks me thinking it will be a one-on-one and suddenly \u201cYahoo!\u201d, Veldora appears!</p><br/><p>Ku ku ku. How pitiful the opponent would seem.</p><br/><p>What a ridiculous trump card I\u2019ve acquired.</p><br/><p>Speaking of that, weren\u2019t there two pieces of information?</p><br/><p>\u226aThe second: via food chain, a great number of abilities have been offered up to you, master.</p><br/><p>Should I selectively eliminate some through combining and strengthening others? [YES]/[NO]\u226b</p><br/><p>Not that I\u2019ll have the time to use them.</p><br/><p>I mean, surely there are some who have spent years researching these skills. I won\u2019t be able to use them right away anyways.</p><br/><p>So that should be fine.</p><br/><p>I thought, and selected [YES].</p><br/><p>Skills combination has begun, and quickly ended.</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. Unique skill\u300eEndless Prison\u300fhas been used as a base during fusion\u2026 success.</p><br/><p>Unique skill\u300eEndless Prison\u300fhas evolved into ultimate skill\u300eCovenant King Uriel\u300f\u226b</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>So I had acquired unique skill\u300eEndless Prison\u300fas well\u2026</p><br/><p>That was an important announcement but Raphael-san is completely unfazed.</p><br/><p>Covenant, in other words, loyalty.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this is the crystallized form of my believers\u2019 loyalty.</p><br/><p>A skill created by combining every that I had acquired\u2013ultimate skill\u300eCovenant King Uriel\u300f\u2026 huh.</p><br/><p>I check my strength after acquiring the skill. I feel an overwhelming sense of safety.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this is the proof of my bonds with my comrades.</p><br/><p>Hmm? Wait a second\u2026</p><br/><p>Does this mean that I have acquired four ultimate skills?!</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 isn\u2019t it fine for me to be proud of my abilities? No, let\u2019s not get negligent.</p><br/><p>Pitiful are the days of a proud fool, they say.</p><br/><p>As someone who calls himself a demon lord, I can\u2019t let my guard down.</p><br/><p>Right! Whenever I get carried away I lose. This is the time for utmost prudence.</p><br/><p>Anyways, let\u2019s check its abilities.</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. Ultimate skill\u300eCovenant King Uriel\u300fhas the following abilities.</p><br/><p>Spacial Domination: The ability to to manipulate space to shift to a recognized coordinate. Movement Ability.</p><br/><p>Defense Barrier: The ability to create a multi-layered defense, and distort space in order to create absolute defense.</p><br/><p>Infinite Prison: The ability to completely seal the target with the ultimate seal.</p><br/><p>Secluded Space: The ability to control heat by manipulating inertia. It is now possible to release and absorb heat at will.</p><br/><p>That is all.</p><br/><p>Upon acquiring this skill, relevant inferior extra skills have been removed\u226b</p><br/><p>I see\u2026</p><br/><p>Spacial Domination seems to allow me to transfer somewhere in a single moment.</p><br/><p>Defense Barrier seems to now cover my body. My interference is unnecessary, Raphael seems to have it completely under control.</p><br/><p>Infinite Prison can activate according to my will. It is the same barrier that trapped Veldora. In other words, those I capture can never get out.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t really get Secluded Space. I do believe I have a higher class flame manipulation ability though\u2026</p><br/><p>As a test, I set my fist ablaze.</p><br/><p>On my command, it disappears. Oh\u2026 okay.</p><br/><p>Without wasting the released heat, I can preserve the state of an isolated space.</p><br/><p>Since it surpasses my understanding I might not be able to use it, but I do understand that it\u2019s another absurd skill.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s leave it to Raphael-san.</p><br/><p>Frankly, Uriel\u2019s skills are instant travel, absolute defense, and sealing.</p><br/><p>These I understand completely.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 aren\u2019t I invincible?</p><br/><p>\u2026 No, no, I had just decided to stay prudent.</p><br/><p>No getting on the high horse for this slime.</p><br/><p>While I was verifying my abilities, Veldora was checking his own ultimate skill\u300eInvestigation King Faust\u300f.</p><br/><p>Sounds like an amazing skill.</p><br/><p>Its abilities include Thought Acceleration, Appraisal, All of Creation, Probability Estimation, and Pursuit of Truth.</p><br/><p>Even I don\u2019t have the latter two. Unfortunately, food chain is not activating.</p><br/><p>But, i probably wouldn\u2019t understand them anyways.</p><br/><p>Thus having finished investigating my new abilities, I headed out.</p><br/><p>We opened the door and stepped outside.</p><br/><p>Gabil was kneeling there, waiting for us.</p><br/><p>Did something happen?</p><br/><p>\u300cT-t-today is t-t-truly a fortunate d-day\u2026</p><br/><p>To find Rimuru-sama and V-Veldora-sama in good health\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>He\u2019s trembling nervously.</p><br/><p>I see, he noticed Veldora\u2019s rebirth.</p><br/><p>No matter what form he takes, his presence gives him away.</p><br/><p>And Dragonewts are far descendants of dragons.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the monsters of Jura Forest for a long time revered Veldora.</p><br/><p>So of course the rebirth would cause a panic.</p><br/><p>I see, so even if him going outside wouldn\u2019t trouble me, it could cause a panic inside the city.</p><br/><p>\u300cVeldora, you wouldn\u2019t mind me releasing the clone and having you hop back inside for a minute?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Nope, not at all.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t finished reading this one manga through your memories, and I can use your eyes to obtain all the necessary information\u300d</p><br/><p>He happily agreed.</p><br/><p>For now, let\u2019s introduce him to department heads first.</p><br/><p>After Veldora entered me,</p><br/><p>\u300cGabil, there\u2019s no need to worry that much.</p><br/><p>If you look closely, he\u2019s a really nice dragon\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cU-umm\u2026</p><br/><p>What would be the relationship between Rimuru-sama aand Veldora-sama?</p><br/><p>And on that note, since when had Veldora-sama been reborn?\u300d</p><br/><p>Trying to hide his trembling, he asked.</p><br/><p>And I cheerfully explained.</p><br/><p>Promising that I\u2019ll introduce him to everyone at the meeting of the department heads.</p><br/><p>Now then, after returning to the city, I find it troubling, as expected.</p><br/><p>Those who could notice noticed, it seems.</p><br/><p>The word on the street is \u201cStorm Dragon has been reborn\u201d, so everyone is on their guard.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Rimuru-sama, you are unhurt!</p><br/><p>We suddenly felt the rebirth of the Storm Dragon Veldora-sama from the cave.</p><br/><p>Knowing that Rimuru-sama has headed off in that direction, we were worried.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs my brother, is Gabil alive?!\u300d</p><br/><p>Rigurdo was reassured by my return, and so said.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Gabil\u2019s sister Souka ran up concerned.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Oh, no problems. Rigurdo, how are the preparations for the meeting?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy. Proceeding without delay.</p><br/><p>More importantly, it seems that Veldora-sama\u2019s presence is approaching here\u300d</p><br/><p>Word does go around fast.</p><br/><p>This is a good opportunity to introduce him to everyone.</p><br/><p>Letting everyone know, we decided to hold a great conference.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll also have Youmu, Ellen, and the other humans attend.</p><br/><p>We need to decide our next steps, after all.</p><br/><p>\u300cSouka, Gabil will be there, and you must participate too.</p><br/><p>Let Souei know to gather every member!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! I live to serve!\u300d</p><br/><p>She exclaimed and ran off.</p><br/><p>At a speed at which Rigurdo could not follow, she ran off to deliver Souei the message.</p><br/><p>If I leave it to them, they should gather everyone quickly.</p><br/><p>While that was being done, I had Rigurdo explain the Department Heads\u2019 abilities.</p><br/><p>First, Benimaru</p><br/><p>Name: Benimaru</p><br/><p>Race: Fair Oni</p><br/><p>Blessing: Tempest Crest</p><br/><p>Title: Oni King</p><br/><p>Rank: A rank [EP: 213,000]</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Skills: Unique skill\u300eGeneralissimo\u300fThought acceleration, Thought Domination, Prediction</p><br/><p>.

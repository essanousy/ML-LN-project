Leon vs Yuuki \u2013Part 1-</p><br/><p>The ultimate skill \u300eAvarice King Mammon\u300fis an ability specialized in depriving.</p><br/><p>As expected, the most heinous character was bestowed with the evilest ability.</p><br/><p>A moment prior, Yuuki was in an overwhelmingly disadvantageous position. Perhaps had Chloe joined the fight the tables could possibly be turned, but Yuuki wished to avoid that.</p><br/><p>The number of times Chloe could be commanded was set at 3 times. Moreover, an order was consumed via his first command \u201cDo not interfere with me\u201d.</p><br/><p>This was the greatest command he could achieve against Chloe\u2019s ability. If he wished for her to serve him faithfully, even all of the wishes would not be enough.</p><br/><p>Simply commanding Chloe not to turn hostile exerted him to his utmost. Nevertheless, he had taken countermeasures to agains the possibility of Chloe awakening from this Curse of Dominance.</p><br/><p>Yuuki had to use every ounce of his soul to maintain this soul contract.</p><br/><p>And now, even though Yuuki\u2019s own Ultimate skill has awakened, he decided to abstain from using her power.</p><br/><p>Chloe\u2019s specialty is combat. Even so, Yuuki did not fail to consider the possibility that Chloe was seeking to annul the contract every moment she was with him.</p><br/><p>After all, she almost succeeded a second ago.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026 I thought she was awfully quiet, but she was trying to cancel the contract with me, huh?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki said, shrugging.</p><br/><p>Chloe remained silent, with a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>Setting aside whether the attempt would have succeeded or not, the fact remains that she tried.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s a given, thought Yuuki. Unless you\u2019re an idiot, it\u2019s unnatural for someone to simply obey.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell whatever. Looks like I made it in time. Now then, Leon. Shall we continue?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki nodded in regards to Chloe\u2019s reaction, and faced Leon.</p><br/><p>Leon scowled at the blissful expression on Yuuki\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>With both sides now possessing an ultimate skill, Leon had already lost his advantage.</p><br/><p>But situation wise, Leon still had the advantage.</p><br/><p>Yuuki may have awoken to his ultimate skill, but his energy has not yet recovered.</p><br/><p>He was still stuck with whatever was left over from dominating Chloe.</p><br/><p>But still Yuuki refused to deploy his trump card. He wanted to win with what he already in hand.</p><br/><p>Yuuki continued to think, but his current situation remained unfortunate.</p><br/><p>The Silver Knight Alrose was currently fighting face to face against Kagali. Both sides were evenly matched.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Leon\u2019s strongest subordinate the Black Knight Claude, alongside the red knight and the blue knight were fighting against Yuuki\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>The Black Knight Claude displayed overwhelming might in battle.</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s Subordinates, who originally numbered more than 10, were now reduced to mere 5. And even now, another one was felled by his strike.</p><br/><p>And then there was 4. They planned to assist Alrose in the fight against Kagari after cleaning up the small fries.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a moment, Yuuki-sama! At this rate woudn\u2019t we be killed?!\u300d</p><br/><p>Becoming rather desperate-looking, Kagali continuously evaded Alrose.</p><br/><p>Looking at her struggle,</p><br/><p>\u300cYou really are weak aren\u2019t you\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki answered Kagari with disgust.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut I guess having this be a one-sided slaughter does bug me, so how about I go on the offensive?\u300d</p><br/><p>He slipped behind the red knight.</p><br/><p>And while avoiding the sword slashing towards him,</p><br/><p>\u300cLife steal\u300d</p><br/><p>And then, a palm rested on Red Knight\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>As soon as Yuuki lifted his palm, the Red Knight crumpled on the spot.</p><br/><p>[The editor just came to the realization that these knights are based off of power rangers\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u300cRed Knight?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNee-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>Red Knight didn\u2019t respond to Black Knight Claude\u2019s and Blue Knight\u2019s screams.</p><br/><p>Or rather, she couldn\u2019t. The reason being that she was already dead.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s useless to beckon you know? That\u2019s because, I just took that person\u2019s life\u300d</p><br/><p>Looking like his powered restored a little, Yuuki stated the fact with icy cold words.</p><br/><p>This, was no longer a battle.</p><br/><p>Only the Depriver, and the deprived.</p><br/><p>Between the two, there was a hopeless gap.</p><br/><p>Defeating all of Yuuki\u2019s subordinates, Blue Knight rushed towards Red Knight to confirm what he had proclaimed.</p><br/><p>His sister did not show signs of movement. she was without a doubt, dead.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou Bastard!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Blue Knight was enraged,</p><br/><p>\u300cOi oi, this is a battle, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>You\u2019ve been killing my subordinates too weren\u2019t you, isn\u2019t getting angry over this a bit unreasonable?\u300d</p><br/><p>TN: This guy\u2026</p><br/><p>In response to Yuuki\u2019s words, their killing intent intensified.</p><br/><p>As for Leon, after looking at Yuuki\u2019s ability he realized the graveness of the situation.</p><br/><p>Even if it had just awakened, Yuuki\u2019s already completely mastered the ability. In the first place, leveling the playing field was something outside of his calculation.</p><br/><p>Leon did not underestimate Yuuki. Yet, he concluded that Yuuki must be exterminated before was is given a chance to grow because of how unpredictable and dangerous he was.</p><br/><p>Certainly he wanted to save Chloe as soon as possible; however, circumstances as they were dictated against solo action.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he decided to retreat.</p><br/><p>All of Yuuki\u2019s subordinates have been eliminated; all that was left was the woman known as Kagali. Although he was worried about that vicious glare, strength wise she didn\u2019t seem like that much of a problem.</p><br/><p>But with an ability that steals an opponent\u2019s soul without resistance through touch, Leon judged that Yuuki was far too dangerous for Leon and his companions.</p><br/><p>\u300cWithdraw for now\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon decided, and immediately ordered.</p><br/><p>\u300cLeon-sama, allow me to be the rearguard\uff01\u300d</p><br/><p>The Black Knight Claude cried out, and appeared in front of Leon, by the wall facing Yuuki.</p><br/><p>\u300cAra? Leon are you escaping? I wouldn\u2019t allow such a thing you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki revealed a beaming smile, manipulating the surrounding trees and blocked Leon\u2019s retreat path.</p><br/><p>However, something of this degree couldn\u2019t possibly block Leon. Light of the ultimate skill \u201cKing of Purity Metatron\u201d gathered in his palm, Leon forcefully destroyed the trees and opened the way.</p><br/><p>Although Leon tried to trigger transfer magic, his attempt merely resulted in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u201cHa ha, you can\u2019t use transfer here you know? Didn\u2019t you know? One of the reasons I chose this place was because it seals off any attempts of escaping via transfer\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki said, happily.</p><br/><p>Then, without missing the opportunity from the failed transfer</p><br/><p>\u300cOverwrite\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s hands touched Black Knight Claude\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Despite being caught off guard for an instant, Claude took evasive measures. Thanks to that, he didn\u2019t fall like the Red Knight.</p><br/><p>No, something was off, and when Leon noticed,</p><br/><p>\u300cYuuki-sama, my name is Claude. What are your orders!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Black Knight Sir Claude, kneeled towards Yuuki.</p><br/><p>The worst development had come about.</p><br/><p>What Yuuki can deprive was not limited to someone\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Their life, ability, and even their mind.</p><br/><p>No matter how deeply their loyalty is embedded onto their soul, by re-writing the information in their soul, it\u2019s possible to instill loyalty onto himself.</p><br/><p>Such is the ability of Yuuki\u2019s ultimate skill \u201cAvarice King Mammon\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300cAhaha, now excluding Chloe, it\u2019s finally a 3 on 3! We\u2019re finally even, eh?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki laughed happily,</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected, you have a really fine personality, Yuuki-sama\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>But, Leon. Seeing you making that face fills me with endless joy.\u201d</p><br/><p>A joyful smile appeared on Kagali (Kazalim).</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard, what did you do to Claude?\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon asked,</p><br/><p>\u300cI just took your subordinates. Isn\u2019t everyone fine with it?</p><br/><p>If the target swore loyalty to no one, this skill wouldn\u2019t have worked.</p><br/><p>Overwrite is an ability that allows me to re-write at whom the loyalty is directed.\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki who answered cheerfully turned to examine Claude to ascertain his feelings.</p><br/><p>From the looks of Claude he has succeded,</p><br/><p>TN Comment: $20 dollars betting anyone that this ability will fail to affect Shion when they do fight.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut this ability is surprisingly useful\u300d</p><br/><p>He laughed, satisfied.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was best to call this power evil incarnate.</p><br/><p>The higher their level of loyalty, the easier it is for them to fall into the hands of Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Kagali was overjoyed at Leon\u2019s dire situation, and the Black Knight Claude who had betrayed naturally pointed his sword towards Leon without hesitation.</p><br/><p>As Yuuki claimed, excluding Chloe this has turned to a 3 on 3 battle.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the situation has become overwhelmingly disadvantageous for Leon.</p><br/><p>But even amidst this disadvantageous situation, Leon\u2019s heart did not waver.</p><br/><p>Considering Yuuki\u2019s personality, one ought to have expected him to set up some sort of trap.</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t seem to have activated the trap yet, however Leon has already understood the nature of this trap.</p><br/><p>TN Note: Leon\u2019s name hasn\u2019t appeared, but I took the liberty to make it flow a bit better.</p><br/><p>A magnetic field that interferes with transfer magic, drifting miasma. Uncharted mountains where mostly dragons dwell and humans seldom come, a mysterious place.</p><br/><p>Intelligence has mentioned something akin to this place in their reports. It was \u2026</p><br/><p>But even if his assumption was correct, and the trap had indeed been sprung, it would not cause Leon any inconvenience.</p><br/><p>(In that case, Rimuru and Ruminas, who focus on the magical attribute, would be really troubled if they fought him)</p><br/><p>He murmured to himself.</p><br/><p>Her eyes sparkled for a moment when his gaze met Chloe\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t despair under these circumstances, her gaze conveyed her intention strongly.</p><br/><p>Looking at Claude who was once a loyal subject then looking back at Chloe once more, Chloe nodded faintly.</p><br/><p>(Something can be done, is that it? Well\u2026 Red Knight probably can\u2019t, but\u2026 )</p><br/><p>Yuuki must have thought that these circumstances were truly inconvenient to Leon, but he misunderstood that Leon really didn\u2019t care about his subordinates that much. He used them as long as they were useful; he had no duty to protect them.</p><br/><p>No matter which of his subordinates you ask, not one would expect to be protected by him.</p><br/><p>In fact, every single one of them would be joyful at an opportunity to perish as his shield.</p><br/><p>(Even so, that doesn\u2019t meant they want to die)</p><br/><p>At one point he thought of retreating because his subordinates were a hindrance.</p><br/><p>Whenever Leon gets serious, people around him get caught up in it. Precisely because of this, he refused the work together with Rimuru and Ruminas.</p><br/><p>And when he thought to retreat, his subordinate Claude was stolen.</p><br/><p>This no longer was a situation he could allow to continue.</p><br/><p>Leon looked at Red Knight, and gently killed off the anger in his heart. Leon is a king, to waiver at the death of his subordinates should not be something present.</p><br/><p>The enemy, were Yuuki and Kagari.</p><br/><p>Claude may be Leon\u2019s strongest subordinate, but he knows him like the palm of his hand. He\u2019s not Leon\u2019s enemy.</p><br/><p>Kagali seems like a female devil that uses a familiar trick. She seems to hold a serious grudge towards Leon, but he couldn\u2019t recall.</p><br/><p>His heart isn\u2019t big enough to remember the grudges of each and every small fry. She seems to be good at using curse spells, but not at a level worthy of calling a threat.</p><br/><p>It\u2019d be fine to ignore this woman, thought Leon.</p><br/><p>In that case, the only enemy here is Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Yuuki is a real pain, having awakened an ultimate skill here. He truly is a man who gains strength in the face of adversity.</p><br/><p>But\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Leon had a thin smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you know? Ultimate skills are not equal\u2014there could be a difference between them as great as between heaven and the earth!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve changed my mind, I\u2019m not withdrawing, I\u2019m going to bury you here\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon\u2019s ultimate skill is the apex of the light class, an existence that could be called the bane of being of magic origin.</p><br/><p>And, Leon knows someone else who holds an Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>He tried confronting him once, and his defeat was so overwhelming it couldn\u2019t be called a fight at all.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u201dLord of Darkness\u201d Guy\u30fbCrimson\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>The strongest of the Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>Leon made full use of his Ultimate skill, and attacked with full force. The result was a complete defeat.</p><br/><p>After defeating Kazalim, Guy\u30fbCrimson aimlessly visited to issue a challenge. If he won he would be allowed to do as he wished, if he lost Leon was to become Guy\u2019s companion.</p><br/><p>Leon came with the intention to kill, and Guy simply defended all his attacks as if he were toying.</p><br/><p>The experience of defeat had made Leon strong.</p><br/><p>After all, in a battle between Ultimate skill wielders, the key to victory is to understand the opponent\u2019s ability first.</p><br/><p>If a person couldn\u2019t comprehend what had happened, then his defeat is inevitable. For Leon, Guy was a person capable of overwhelming others so.</p><br/><p>Then, for a person without an ultimate skill, prevailing against those with one is impossible. Going as far as preparing a number of thing to prevent confrontation.</p><br/><p>It was outside of his calculation for Yuuki to come here and then awaken an ultimate skill like he did, however this wasn\u2019t enough to determine Leon\u2019s defeat.</p><br/><p>Over the course of hundreds of years, Leon familiarized himself with his skill. Since Yuuki has just awakened, his grasp of his skill is yet imperfect.</p><br/><p>And, that is good. If he were to awaken his abilities in the dark, he would certainly become troublesome when Leon would have faced him.</p><br/><p>(The sprouting bud of a threat should be plucked here and now)</p><br/><p>In front of Leon, the evil youth Kagurazaka Yuuki, has finally been recognized as an enemy that must be eradicated.</p><br/><p>Yuuki perceived, that the atmosphere of the handsome blond man in front of him, Leon\u30fbCormwell, had changed.</p><br/><p>What, what is that\u2026\u2026? He thought.</p><br/><p>In a flash of light\u2014Leon himself, Yuuki could only watch as Claude was blown away.</p><br/><p>With an intense blow from Leon\u2019s bare hands, the jet black armor of Black Knight Sir. Claude was half-destroyed, rendering him unable to battle.</p><br/><p>While looking at Claude who was blown off into Chloe\u2019s vinicity, he clicked his tongue,</p><br/><p>\u300cChloe, can you heal that guy? I\u2019d rather have a comrade I made after a lot of effort than a dead subordinate\u300d</p><br/><p>He called out to Chloe.</p><br/><p>\u300cSure, why not\u300d</p><br/><p>Was that a command? No, and there is an explanation for that.</p><br/><p>If the curse wasn\u2019t used, it would be treated as Chloe\u2019s own will rather than a command.</p><br/><p>The exchange, which has been ongoing for a few days now, led Yuuki to be able to fight without much effort at this point.</p><br/><p>But Leon\u2019s current attack speed was at a level where Yuuki could barely react.</p><br/><p>It seems, the demon lord Leon is seriously enraged.</p><br/><p>(So he was this strong! Even with my abnormal strength, catching that would be dangerous.</p><br/><p>I deliberately tried to anger him\u2026 but I guess I failed?)</p><br/><p>TN Note: Oh no, it was a success. It was a little too big of a success in fact.</p><br/><p>In fact, even in this situation Yuuki is thinking playful thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys, return first. And then, inform the Ruminas and Rimuru as to what happened her.\u300d</p><br/><p>Silver Knight Alrose and Blue knight could only nod at Leon\u2019s instruction.</p><br/><p>If Leon who was their master fought seriously, they noticed that they would only be a burden. Moreover, they feared to cause him trouble if they were stolen by the other side.</p><br/><p>Even though his sister was killed, Blue Knight didn\u2019t fail to calmly comprehend the current situation. They quickly withdrew without a complaint.</p><br/><p>Confirming the two that are swiftly preparing their escape,</p><br/><p>\u300cI won\u2019t allow that!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kagali tried to interfere with her puppet trees,</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastards seem to be underestimating me\u300d</p><br/><p>Under the light that Leon released, all the trees crumbled and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cGeh, geeh!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Noticing that Leon\u2019s attack was directed at her, Kagali quickly darted behind Chloe.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, wait a moment Chloe-chan. You\u2019re protecting me too right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Imprudently, Kagari tried to muddle into Chloe\u2019s defense barrier.</p><br/><p>And much to everyone\u2019s amazement,</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t particularly mind\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Answered Chloe,</p><br/><p>\u300cWell! As expected, Chloe Chan truly is kind. As expected of the hero!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kagali looked happy and joyfully rubbed Chloe\u2019s cheek with her own, Chloe pushed her away with disgust.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, the order of things have merely changed\u300d</p><br/><p>Said Leon,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, hey, Yuuki-sama! Can\u2019t you hear what he\u2019s saying?</p><br/><p>Do you seriously think you can win?\u300d</p><br/><p>Remembering the traumas of defeat, the frightened Kagali cried out.</p><br/><p>She clearly abandoned any hopes of appearing composed.</p><br/><p>After all, even after several hundred years there stood Leon\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>He had mentally scarred Kagali</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2026. You really have a wonderful personality, you know\u2026?</p><br/><p>Just shut up and watch how I win this\u300d</p><br/><p>In reality, Yuuki was not sure he had the ability to say that.</p><br/><p>When Leon\u2019s subordinates escaped, he considered giving chase but Leon\u2019s current state dissuaded him.</p><br/><p>Clearly, there\u2019s time to spare for Leon, and ignoring him would be a suicidal act. Kagali was careless and still alive only because she wasn\u2019t being directly targeted.</p><br/><p>No, perhaps he merely returned the favor of Yuuki having overlooked the escape of his subordinates. And probably, that light released from Leon\u2019s skill is an attack that would engulf surrounding people in it.</p><br/><p>He merely avoided using it to not hurt his own subordinates. That\u2019s probably how it was.</p><br/><p>(Now I\u2019ve done it; I feel like I\u2019ve trend on the tiger\u2019s tail)</p><br/><p>TN Note: It\u2019s a Japanese idiom, meaning he\u2019s taken a great risk.</p><br/><p>Even as Yuuki was thinking such things, a smile crept onto his face.</p><br/><p>Truly, if he had asked asked Rimuru and Ruminas for reinforcements, Yuuki wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance.</p><br/><p>He would have to use his trump card and even then he would likely fall.</p><br/><p>And even if he played this card now, Leon would be defeated, but Yuuki was also lose.</p><br/><p>Now then, what could he do?</p><br/><p>With Chloe the battle would be won quickly. But to use her to kill a single person Leon would be a waste. And perhaps he could somehow manage against a single demon lord.</p><br/><p>In that case, all he had to do was to try</p><br/><p>He has finally acquired an ultimate skill; it would be a waste not to test it.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, Leon. You are more dangerous than you appeared.</p><br/><p>Even so, victory will be mine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSay as much bullshit as you want. You, underestimated a demon lord. Time to face reality\u300d</p><br/><p>Their auras clashed creating lighting which flashed between the heaven and the earth.</p><br/><p>No more conversation could be had.</p><br/><p>Naught but battle remained.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

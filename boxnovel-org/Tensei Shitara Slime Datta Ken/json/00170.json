I questioned internally , and asked for details but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cH-hey! What in the world is Guy doing here!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris noticed Guy and started making noise.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh? What are you doing here?</p><br/><p>As I recall, weren\u2019t you living in the \u300eDwelling of the Spirit\u300f located in the Ulgracia Republic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufun! Don\u2019t go thinking I\u2019ll always be an unemployed shut-in, \u2018kay?</p><br/><p>Even I can get a job, and happen to have one right now!</p><br/><p>I\u2019m earning a lot, and can even hire people now!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSay what!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy made a perplexed face at Ramiris\u2019 boasting.</p><br/><p>To make the calm and composed Guy get worked up like that, Ramiris, you\u2019re pretty good.</p><br/><p>Guy then looked at me, and I lightly explained how Ramiris was now working here.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo basically, I\u2019m having her help me out in a lot of ways.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSee! Just like I said right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris proudly made some shadow-boxing poses like woosh woosh! towards guy from behind my head.</p><br/><p>Well it\u2019s fine, but please stop using me like a shield.</p><br/><p>\u300cHah! Getting all cheery after getting a simple job.</p><br/><p>A loner like you actually hiring people?</p><br/><p>I see you\u2019ve learned some good jokes!\u300d</p><br/><p>Lead on by Guy\u2019s provocation,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy you!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris unleashed her Killer Dropkick on him.</p><br/><p>But her fierce attack missed, and she had been easily captured.</p><br/><p>A pleasant debacle, but there were more important matters to tend to.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait wait, you can do that later, but about Veldora.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this about him going to Ruminas\u2019 place?\u300d</p><br/><p>Recovering a hung-upside-down-and-struggling Ramiris from Guy, I asked.</p><br/><p>Ramiris can only concentrate on one thing at a time, so I needed to ask about the important things first.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh right!</p><br/><p>Me and Master (Veldora) were looking at different places, but suddenly, he changed the screen, and got really nervous\u2026\u2026 and flew out shouting \u300cI\u2019m worried about Ruminas, so I\u2019ll go help!\u300d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t see Ruminas on the screen though\u2026\u2026 wonder why?\u300d</p><br/><p>As expected, Ramiris\u2019 explanation was useless, and the situation remained just as vague.</p><br/><p>The only certainty was the fact that Veldora headed towards Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Jeez, what a pain, I thought when,</p><br/><p>\u300cMy? Has the boy run away?</p><br/><p>And I finally came over to see him too\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>It was a chilling voice.</p><br/><p>Without leaving so much as a speck of her presence, a single woman opened the door.</p><br/><p>Snow white skin. Cold, bewitching Blue Diamond eyes.</p><br/><p>She was a dazzling beauty.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t feel alive, her beauty was like that of a doll.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is a pleasure, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama.</p><br/><p>My name is Velzard.</p><br/><p>Or, would you be more familiar with \u2018Ice Dragon\u2019 Velzard?</p><br/><p>I am Veldora\u2019s elder sister.\u300d</p><br/><p>She said with a graceful bow.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s sister? In other words, this beautiful lady is another \u2018True Dragon\u2019!?</p><br/><p>Since very recently, Veldora finally managed to fully control his magic leakage, but this person was controlling hers as if it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><br/><p>The fact that I couldn\u2019t sense as much as a hint of her presence itself proved her might.</p><br/><p>If not told, I would have never guessed she was a \u2018True Dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>However, her overflowing spirit (TN: Haki) didn\u2019t leave any room to consider her a weakling.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Hello, I\u2019m Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Despite this form, I\u2019m an active Demon Lord.\u300d</p><br/><p>I also introduced myself, and asked Shuna, who had guided her in, to ready another serving of tea.</p><br/><p>Shuna worked with expertise, never losing her composure.</p><br/><p>No, not just her, everyone who worked in serving duty did their job with the same diligence no matter who the guest was.</p><br/><p>They had become professionals.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re terrible, Guy. Leaving me behind like that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh haha. Sorry. I forgot you were sort of bad at flying.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m not that bad; Aren\u2019t you just too fast?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm. Well, no biggie right? You knew where I was headed right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, since you were going to call Misery and Hillary anyway, you could\u2019ve just waited for me too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are right and all. But you had some good exercise after so long, so it\u2019s a win-win.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes yes, whatever.\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzard sighed as if giving up, and gracefully placed herself on a chair.</p><br/><p>The smell of trees pleased her nose.</p><br/><p>Though there was a soft sofa, the wooden chairs were also quite comfortable.</p><br/><p>Surrounded by the forest, it felt as if you were one with mother nature.</p><br/><p>After a sip of the tea brought by Shuna,</p><br/><p>\u300cHonestly, that Veldora, he didn\u2019t have to run away\u300d</p><br/><p>She complained.</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t think Veldora ran away, but in retrospect, he never did want to go to the continent of demons.</p><br/><p>He made excuses like it was too cold there or something, and I always thought it was strange since cold didn\u2019t affect him.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey Guy, are you perhaps living in the cold northern continent? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMm? Yeah it\u2019s a frigid place known as the \u2018Continent of Eternal Ice\u2019, why?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause I don\u2019t suppress my magic there\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>that unbearably cold place has now become an environment completely hostile to life.\u300d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m convinced now.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m positive that Veldora can\u2019t handle his sister Velzard.</p><br/><p>He happened to notice Velzard through the Surveillance Magic, and made a straight line for elsewhere.</p><br/><p>It was not like him, but I had a friend once who felt similarly about his own big sister.</p><br/><p>\u300cShe\u2019s too evil\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>My friend had complained.</p><br/><p>Even a \u2018True Dragon\u2019 like Veldora must have the same feelings.</p><br/><p>By the way, some others also boasted misfortune with their younger sisters, but I, who only had an elder brother, honestly couldn\u2019t relate.</p><br/><p>Both sides had their share of troubles, was my impression.</p><br/><p>\u300cVelzard-san, could it be that Veldora isn\u2019t that fond of you?\u300d</p><br/><p>I casually asked.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh my? I have been taking care of him so well since he started rampaging as a baby.</p><br/><p>I even held him down, and stopped him whenever he was being rowdy.</p><br/><p>He was useless and couldn\u2019t even maintain humanoid form, and I even took the trouble of punishing him after too many of his little disasters\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzard recounted episodes from the past, describing the kind things she had done for him.</p><br/><p>The reason became clear now.</p><br/><p>Judging from the story, against Veldora\u2019s \u2018action oriented\u2019 powers, Velzard\u2019s \u2018binding oriented\u2019 powers were extremely effective.</p><br/><p>In other words, natural enemies.</p><br/><p>Yeah, I had to agree to his wanting to run away, even if she wouldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>That ever confident and fearless Veldora having a weakness \u2015\u2015 Or rather, sister. Not exactly blood related though \u2015\u2015 like that was unexpected.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, we spent the time listening to Velzard\u2019s stories, and chatting with Guy.</p><br/><p>Ramiris happily ate cake, and got along well with Velzard.</p><br/><p>Velzard also became fond of the cake.</p><br/><p>When the topic of teaching the baking techniques to the maids came up,</p><br/><p>\u300cGoodness. Guy can occasionally do good things too I see.</p><br/><p>Thank you very much for undertaking our maids\u2019 education.\u300d</p><br/><p>She requested cheerfully.</p><br/><p>Now, there was no way I could refuse.</p><br/><p>If I did, I could end up awakening something even more fearsome than Guy.</p><br/><p>Listening to Ramiris bragging to Guy, and correcting her exaggerations, I spent the time quite peacefully.</p><br/><p>After a decent amount of conversation, I took the time to ascend Hillary and Misery before forgetting.</p><br/><p>Since I had claimed that only Gluttony King Belz\u00e9buth could do it, the fact that I took quite a bit more souls than required will be my little secret.</p><br/><p>Following Raphael-sensei\u2019s footsteps, I decided to be a bit bold myself.</p><br/><p>Giving each of them 90,000 souls at a steady pace soon resulted in evolution.</p><br/><p>It was exactly as Wisdom Lord Raphael had said.</p><br/><p>And with that, I had another 520,000 souls remaining.</p><br/><p>I could now reward the ones who I couldn\u2019t evolve in the ceremony.</p><br/><p>I was worried what would happen when Guy came over, but the event concluded well with us on friendly terms.</p><br/><p>\u300cHope I wasn\u2019t a bother.</p><br/><p>Now these two can be of a little use too.</p><br/><p>Well, you can call me if anything happens.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll help you out a bit, alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, thanks. You can call me on you end too. I\u2019ll do what I can.\u300d</p><br/><p>We said our goodbyes with promises of cooperation.</p><br/><p>Or rather, the Gate was connected and travelling to and fro took zero time.</p><br/><p>Just to confirm, I had a quick visit and came back.</p><br/><p>Now, it became possible to Teleport to Guy\u2019s domain.</p><br/><p>This Skill was only possible for places already visited.</p><br/><p>A steady effort like this was necessary in hopes of making our plans to travel the world come into fruition.</p><br/><p>Teleportation was not possible for those not strong enough.</p><br/><p>But someday, I hoped to set up Transit Gates to move important facilities.</p><br/><p>And so, we saw Guy and his bunch off.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s an unnecessary detail, but Guy ended up eating 5 pieces of cake.</p><br/><p>At this rate, I felt like he was going to visit again very soon.</p><br/><p>Next time, I could prepare sweets, I thought amusingly.</p><br/><p>Now then, after Guy left, I went to see the three Demon Dukes.</p><br/><p>They looked like dried husks of their former selves.</p><br/><p>\u300cOur sincerest apologies!\u300d</p><br/><p>All three of them bowed profusely, and their injuries seemed to be fine.</p><br/><p>I was relieved.</p><br/><p>I wanted to grant them the souls to evolve immediately.</p><br/><p>Gerudo and Adalman had refused the offer, and I was to wait for the next opportunity in their case.</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t want to force a reward on them, if they didn\u2019t think they deserved it.</p><br/><p>On that note, the three Demon Dukes already showed very promising results. I was making them wait for my own convenience, so now was a good time.</p><br/><p>And it was better that I personally saw to their growth.</p><br/><p>With that, their evolutions resulted in them becoming \u2018Devil Lords\u2019.</p><br/><p>The same result as Misery and Hillary.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a bit troubling, but they had attained the highest rank in the Demon Aristocratic classes.</p><br/><p>Their status as Lord proved their new found strength.</p><br/><p>Anyway, the three of them successfully ascended to the highest rank of elites.</p><br/><p>They understood that overlapping the effects of Skills and Magic could break through multi layered barriers.</p><br/><p>These three girls had picked a fight with the strongest known as Guy, and had fortunately survived.</p><br/><p>This birthed a desire to at least act as a shield for their Rimuru-sama the next time they faced Guy.</p><br/><p>Diablo\u2019s education may have made them gradually stronger, but their defeat in the recent events had lead them to aspire for even greater heights of strength.</p><br/><p>Fighting strong opponents, sparked passion in not only a human\u2019s, but even a Demon\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>The effects of their evolution propagated to the Arch Demons, and evolved them to Demon Dukes.</p><br/><p>As for their level of nobility,</p><br/><p>Duke class: Moss</p><br/><p>Marquis grade: Veyron</p><br/><p>Earl class: Venom</p><br/><p>Viscount class: Agera and Esprit</p><br/><p>Baron class: Shien and Zonda</p><br/><p>Well, these may seem like complicated titles, but it\u2019s just to show the difference in the classes of Demon Dukes.</p><br/><p>Among the rest of the 600 demons, some became Arch Demons which were on par with Knight class, but the rest remained Greater Demons.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t named, so too much of a power up was not expected.</p><br/><p>But as their bodies were that of Culture Capsule Automatons, their strength increased much more than normal.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ll probably prove useful one of these days.</p><br/><p>At present, they were doing miscellaneous work like security or labour, but since they could teleport, I could have them go collect information from various parts of the world.</p><br/><p>Anyway, all of them safely attained greater strength.</p><br/><p>Tomorrow, the Imperial Airships would cross Ruminas\u2019 domain.</p><br/><p>I had already planned to go support her if need be.</p><br/><p>Demons may actually have a good affinity for evolution, since all of them easily completed their Harvest Festivals.</p><br/><p>The link with the Culture Capsules were also improved, and from tomorrow, Demons stronger than Greater Demons would be born.</p><br/><p>The souls I received(stole) from Guy promoted my forces to much greater heights, so looking at the results only, it was a truly beneficial encounter.</p><br/><p>I told the three girls to rest up, and after confirming that they were doing so, I went back to the control room.</p><br/><p>The Imperial Aerial Fighter Legion was on schedule, arriving tomorrow afternoon at the earliest.</p><br/><p>And as I was thinking about contacting Ruminas about Veldora \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>The scene was displayed clearly in one of the Surveillance Screens.</p><br/><p>A Veldora flying at ultra high speeds on a crash course with the Imperial fleet.</p><br/><p>It was an overhead image from a high altitude, so I could easily make out his route.</p><br/><p>At this rate, he would cause war to break out in less than an hour.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously, what is he even doing\u2026\u2026 that Veldora\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>My lone words echoed in the control room.</p><br/><p>\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>Veldora was soaring in the open skies at speeds tens of times higher than that of sound.</p><br/><p>He was having a lot of fun after returning from the cramped humanoid form to his original Dragon form after so long.</p><br/><p>Though, his present feelings aside, the reason he needed to become like this was not fun at all.</p><br/><p>He had run away from his elder sister.</p><br/><p>His sister, Velzard, could be called his single natural enemy.</p><br/><p>Ability-wise, their match up was quite bad for him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, she was born before him, and overpowered him in power, Energy and everything else.</p><br/><p>In an honest fight, he wasn\u2019t confident he could win.</p><br/><p>It happened many times after Veldora came into the world.</p><br/><p>He challenged her, but was beaten instead every time.</p><br/><p>Velzard\u2019s \u2018Eternal World\u2019 was an impregnable defence that also served to seal all of Veldora\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>Storm, Destruction, Corrosion, Doom.</p><br/><p>All of them were nullified against the her absolute bind.</p><br/><p>At present, he may have had a chance at beating her, but it was still too soon.</p><br/><p>After all, only after learning to restrain his power did he realize that his big sister Velzard was always able to do it perfectly.</p><br/><p>The nature of her power, she claimed, was specialized in \u2018cessation of all energy for activity\u2019, but she likely possessed an unmatched strength to complement that.</p><br/><p>Veldora was cautious because he knew that his sister was not to some smallfry.</p><br/><p>\u300cKuhahahaha! Our battle yet awaits!\u300d</p><br/><p>Leaving behind large distances and cool lines, He continued his high speed flight.</p><br/><p>His imminent clash with the Imperials, whether it was fate or coincidence, was unclear.</p><br/><p>But as if playing a tasteless joke, fate had it that one of those Airships was carrying the \u2018Scorch Dragon\u2019 Velgrynd.</p><br/><p>After thousands of years, a fierce battle would result from the encounter of these two \u2018True Dragons\u2019.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Rant:</p><br/><p>Hi there ~ gao! Lion Mask reporting. This is more a slice of life chapter than anything. Like action? Well too bad. Though the fun times are soon to end. This arc is looking a bit better than last one where the enemy was just massacred. Well, I hope you enjoy. Some people have been asking what I\u2019ll do after this arc is over. Well the simple and short answer is: No idea! I don\u2019t think ahead too much. So until further notice Lion Mask RPT should be considered dead. Well\u2026 I do plan on posting TL;DRs as I read further on so probably not really inactive. I\u2019ll be looking into other things to translate, but that topic concerns the unknown future, and isn\u2019t even a reliable statement. Well, there\u2019s one more chapter in the stock which could be up in soon\u2026or not soon. Well. See you there ~~ Gao!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

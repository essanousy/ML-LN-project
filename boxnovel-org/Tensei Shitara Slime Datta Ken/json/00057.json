Actually, he is a fellow who possesses a good impression.</p><br/><p>[Well, is that so?! That\u2019s disappointing!</p><br/><p>Ha ha ha. Eventually it\u2019ll turn better!]</p><br/><p>I\u2019m comforting him sincerely.</p><br/><p>[By the way, Rimuru-san, are you a Monster?</p><br/><p> But how could you pass the barrier of the Association headquarters?]</p><br/><p>[N? Ah, I\u2019m a Monster. My true identity is slime. This trivia, please conceal it!]</p><br/><p>[No, no! That\u2019s not just a trivia!</p><br/><p>Not that.Why did you made such city for monsters?]</p><br/><p>[Eh? No, there are enough monsters to establish a city, is it unusual?]</p><br/><p>[No..... Although from what I heard there\u2019s no other like......] </p><br/><p>[Is that so?]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s right]</p><br/><p>We stare at each other for a while.</p><br/><p>Well, whatever.</p><br/><p>For now I decided to get along with the Leader of Association (Grand Master).</p><br/><p>It is to discourage the city\u2019s image as a suspicious monsters city, for now let\u2019s talk about the truth.</p><br/><p>Come to think about it, Shizu-san is aware of my true identity from the air I carry. I think she\u2019s an amazing person.</p><br/><p>Usually, there is no one that will think a person from another world would reincarnate as a slime.</p><br/><p>[Actually, I\u2019m a \u201cSpace Alien\u201d....]</p><br/><p>[What are you trying to say? You?</p><br/><p>Rather, it\u2019s the first time I heard space alien since coming here!</p><br/><p>By any chance......]</p><br/><p>[Damn, I was exposed!</p><br/><p>So, my true identity is a mysterious hero that fights after doing Transformation (Form Change)! Kamen Racer!]</p><br/><p>*pose*! Or as close as I could do, (TL: Nice!)</p><br/><p>[How nostalgic! Kamen Racer, I was watching it too!</p><br/><p>So, as I thought, Rimuru-san you\u2019re.... a Japanese, right!]</p><br/><p>Fufu.</p><br/><p>After I tell some material that only fellow countrymen could understand, it\u2019s a bull\u2019s eye.</p><br/><p>In case, he doesn\u2019t know the story, at that time I will think about something else.</p><br/><p>After that, we talk about various things together.</p><br/><p>Things that happen after coming to this world, Shizu-san\u2019s final moments.</p><br/><p>Living in this world, Magic.</p><br/><p>The topics from the world on the other side. Such like endings and final episodes of Manga and Anime, he leans his body forward and really get into it.</p><br/><p>[Master! From this point, please instruct me by all means!] (ED: us? Haven\u2019t read 55 &amp; 56) (TL: Sorry after checking the raw, it\u2019s me not us)</p><br/><p>[Fu Fu Fu. It\u2019s difficult. The anime you really want to know is already completed!</p><br/><p>Of course, on those matters the great I won\u2019t make any mistakes, I will restrain on what should not be said. (TL: Should I write it as \u201cI will not give unnecessary spoiler\u201d)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a gentleman\u2019s etiquette!!!]</p><br/><p>[Ha ha~~~!!! By all means, of course!]</p><br/><p>His Desperation comes out.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the conversation, the secretary onee-san entered the room with tea,</p><br/><p>She opened her eyes in shock and almost dropped the tray.</p><br/><p>As expected, the prank has probably ended.</p><br/><p>Well, He can\u2019t read the continuation of his favorite manga, so it's natural for him to be interested.</p><br/><p>Among them, some had reached its conclusion, but most of them didn\u2019t advanced that much.</p><br/><p>Some of them were interesting but some were awful.</p><br/><p>That's what I expected from him, Japanese \u201cWorld Traveler\u201d that has knowledge after living in this world for 10 years.</p><br/><p>Of course, the serious talks begin now.</p><br/><p>The previous one is only casual talk.</p><br/><p>[Rimuru-san, the reason you came to the Royal Capital, is not only to meet me,your fellow countrymen, right?</p><br/><p>Is your goal to \u201cReturn\u201d?]</p><br/><p>Return.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m thinking about it. However, I gave up on it.</p><br/><p>Because I\u2019m already dead. However, for young people such as them, returning might be their goal.</p><br/><p>[Are you able to do that?]</p><br/><p>Regarding this question, the response that comes was silence.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not an easy thing to do.</p><br/><p>If it is an easy thing to do, they would already return a long time ago. I already thought that.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s like a one way road. This world is like a half material world.....]</p><br/><p>And, I understood the explanation he gives.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s simple; the previous world was a full material world, because there is no magic power on Earth.</p><br/><p>Spirits, demons, fairies, monsters can exist because there are magic power in this world.</p><br/><p>Therefore, you can easily go down, but it\u2019s impossible to climb up.</p><br/><p>Once your body became half material, you can\u2019t turn back easily into your full material body.</p><br/><p>[However, there is a way.</p><br/><p>From the legend in the material world (Earth) about demon and devil, if some conditions are met, it is possible to travel between worlds.]</p><br/><p>The talks had been finished.</p><br/><p>Well, it is what is called steps in a research.</p><br/><p>For that goal, I guess I would like to continue hearing the progression of the research.</p><br/><p>[Well, if I\u2019m able to live carefree, then that\u2019s enough.</p><br/><p>The town had been finished, and it\u2019s enjoyable to be together with my companion.</p><br/><p>To converse with fellow countrymen is one of the biggest reason I come to this Royal Capital.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s actually another purpose besides it, and that\u2019s.....]</p><br/><p>The other purposes were.</p><br/><p>To buy magic stones and inspecting the Royal Capital. To measure the degree of civilization, those visits are that important.</p><br/><p>However, the most important purpose I had not forgotten.</p><br/><p>That is, to learn magic!</p><br/><p>[Well, there were several purposes.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s good to talk with you, after this I want to visit the Library.]</p><br/><p>When I said that,</p><br/><p>[Ah, I see. So, it\u2019s Magic right? That sure is nice...</p><br/><p>I also want to learn some of it, however for some reason I can\u2019t use it.</p><br/><p>I think it might be because the change in my body\u2019s nature.</p><br/><p>Magic, would be a man\u2019s special romance......]</p><br/><p>This person, it seems that he is also the kind of person who understood a man\u2019s romance.</p><br/><p>As expected, since it exists he wants to be able to use it.</p><br/><p>[I see.How long do you intend to stay at the Royal Capital?]</p><br/><p>[N? I had thought to stay for about 1 month.</p><br/><p>Now then, I wonder if I can learn magic by that time.]</p><br/><p>[If that's so, can\u2019t you stay for about 3 months?]</p><br/><p>Hearing the explanation, it seems there is lack of school teacher in the Royal Capital.</p><br/><p>There is a lot of impertinent student, so it\u2019s impossible for the B rank adventurer in the Royal Capital.</p><br/><p>When the new school term begins, the new A Rank is scheduled to arrive and take up the position of the teacher. So, there is a need to entrust the position for 3 months until then.</p><br/><p>There is no reason to hurry, even if I may accept it somehow...</p><br/><p>While thinking about this,</p><br/><p>[Teacher\u2019s dormitory, 3 meals a day, and salary of 10 silver coins a day.</p><br/><p>Also! How about additional free pass to the Royal Capital library?]</p><br/><p>[Of course, I will take it! You would do the same if I\u2019m in trouble!]</p><br/><p>[ [ [Ha ha ha ha ha ha!] ] ]</p><br/><p>We shook each other\u2019s hand while smiling; I got a job at the Royal Capital. </p><br/><p>I bid farewell to Yuuki, finishing the formalities in one day, and I was told to go to the dormitory tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The talk immediately ended, there were no problems either and thus the move to the dormitory finished.</p><br/><p>Well, though I experience the Royal Capital Inn service only for 1 night, the service there was quite satisfying.</p><br/><p>The two included meals are delicious. As expected, the seasoning is also used abundantly.</p><br/><p>Even thought the Inn that I resided at is cheap, they also provide a large public bath. And it\u2019s wonderful too.</p><br/><p>In the country, it\u2019s seldom to see a local Inn with Bath service.</p><br/><p>However, if you want to stay for 3 months, living in the dormitory is more convenient. Thus the move to the dormitory is immediately finished.</p><br/><p>Even if I regret nothing, 4 silver coins a day is quite high.</p><br/><p>The salary of 10 Silver coins will be given on the working days, there won\u2019t be any on holiday.</p><br/><p>Though it was expected for the Royal Capital to have high living expense, there is no problem to save money.</p><br/><p>But work is for tomorrow, today is for visiting the library.</p><br/><p>There is a restriction to enter the room with Magic Books.</p><br/><p>But when I present the Adventurer identification card, I can enter the room without any problems. They seem to keep what they had promised to me when I take up the teacher job.</p><br/><p>Even though the Library is located in the Royal Capital, it is not the Royal Library.The Royal Library is located inside the Castle.</p><br/><p>As those are in Royal family possession, only Court Magician can access it.</p><br/><p>In every country the library seems to hold the Country\u2019s secret magic, so it was difficult for a foreigner to visit it.</p><br/><p>But it doesn\u2019t mean that this Library worth is low. They are not.</p><br/><p>The Library, where I stand now, exhibited the secret arts that the adventurers had collected. The Ancient Magic that the Freedom Association adventurers found is also collected at this place. </p><br/><p>It can be said, that it is possible that this Library had a worth that is equal to the other countries Royal Library.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s wonderful.</p><br/><p>Coming to this Royal Capital early like this is like being blessed with good fortune.</p><br/><p>Even though this is a favor from Yuuki, surely it\u2019s mainly because of my good behavior.</p><br/><p>I immediately check the magic books.</p><br/><p>If you read it straight, the books amount is such that it seems to be impossible to read all of them in someone\u2019s lifetime.</p><br/><p>To everyone in the world who studies diligently, Forgive Me!</p><br/><p>After apologizing in my heart, I read it quickly with\u300eGreat Sage\u300f.</p><br/><p>For someone nearby who sees me, it seems to them that I only take a book in my hand for a while and then return them to the shelves. Actually, just by holding it in my hand, the book goes inside my body.</p><br/><p>So! I copy it completely.</p><br/><p>Simultaneous utilization of \u300eGreat Sage\u300fand\u300eGluttony\u300fabilities, high speed copy of the magic books that I hold in my hands.</p><br/><p>I am postponing checking the content of the book for a later time. Unfortunately, it is not possible to be able to use magic just by copying the books.</p><br/><p>But, taking and copying it, I\u2019m able to make the index of the magic books I want.</p><br/><p>After this, it\u2019s necessary for me to study it one by one. For that reason, I took and copied the books one after another without seeing the title.</p><br/><p>Even with the copying speed, it\u2019s taking a whole day, I\u2019m only able to take a tenth portion of all the books here.</p><br/><p>It seems for now on, I\u2019m going to come to the Library frequently in my break time and day off.</p><br/><p>Thus, my day off passed. However, there was no regret.</p><br/><p>For my goal to learn magic, it\u2019s just a trivial thing to do.</p><br/><p>-----------------------------</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s the first day of the job.</p><br/><p>Still this is a bit difficult job, I understood that after experiencing it at the first day taking the position.</p><br/><p>Rather than a teacher, I became an Instructor. Because there isn\u2019t anyone capable to fill the vacant position Shizu-san left. My job is to become the substitution.</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s jobs are not only as the Leader of Freedom Association (Grand Master), but also to manage the Freedom Academy as its Executive Director.</p><br/><p>He was the Chairman too. The person in question says that it\u2019s just a honorary position, but it\u2019s still an important position.</p><br/><p>After coming to this world for 10 years, he develops the Freedom Association, running an academy. In one sense, he is the representative of all the adventurers.</p><br/><p>This academy had also referred as an institution to nurture the association\u2019s member.</p><br/><p>Moreover, each class is separate just like in the Association,</p><br/><p>Thus, they are divided just like how the Association. However, the basic teaching is shared between classes.</p><br/><p>The position I take is the vacant homeroom teacher of the special class. Alias, S class.</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s seem the class\u2019s member is still at the age of elementary grade student.</p><br/><p>It says the former homeroom teacher is the \u201cDemon Teacher\u201d, Izawa Shizue. It\u2019s Shizu-san!</p><br/><p>She\u2019s the hero whose nickname is\u201dExplosive Monarch\u201d. So the teachers succeeding her pale in comparison to her.</p><br/><p>All previous teachers, being unable to handle the \"severe interaction\" with the students, ran away from the academy.</p><br/><p>When I was giving my greetings in the staff room, I was told that by the other teachers.</p><br/><p>[No, even for someone who looks like a child, I think you still had trouble with those problem children.....</p><br/><p>Even if you are a B rank adventurer......</p><br/><p>Well, you had recommendation from the chairman, please quickly report if it seems impossible for you.]</p><br/><p>The principal worries too much.</p><br/><p>They are just kids! Hahaha. Or so what I think.......</p><br/><p>[Chee~~se! From this day, yours new homeroom teacher is....,]</p><br/><p>In the place I stood and greeting them friendly, a flaming sword flying towards me.</p><br/><p>I become panicked and managed to avoid it</p><br/><p>[Ken-chan, Cool~~~!!!]</p><br/><p>[Is that, a special move? You perfected it!?]</p><br/><p>[However, it\u2019s still lacking. It should not be easily avoided!]</p><br/><p>Noisy children.</p><br/><p>I will end up split and charred black if I didn\u2019t avoid it.</p><br/><p>Ey, calm down will ya. The class\u2018ll be destroy\u2019d if ya went ta rampage!</p><br/><p>I retort in pseudo Kansaiben.</p><br/><p>I already want to gone home.</p><br/><p>This place is another world, if a teacher exhibit violence will it be considered a corporal punishment?</p><br/><p>In front of me are 5 human children.</p><br/><p>This is a gathering of problem children.</p><br/><p>Alias, S class. A special class that is composed only by World Travelers.</p><br/><p>Yuuki sheltered the children from every corner of the world.</p><br/><p>They are still kid of elementary grade student, but their abilities is terrifying high.</p><br/><p>Honestly, he is toying with me.</p><br/><p>I thought they were docile, But towards me they are staring with their eyes full with hostility.</p><br/><p>For three months after this, can I take care of these guys.....?</p><br/><p>The depressing feeling from a long time ago is coming back.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

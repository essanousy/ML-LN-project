The damages sustained had been beautifully healed, showing their usual, beautiful splendor.</p><br/><p>However, looking through a highly proficient appraising eye, Their Power(Existance level) had undergone great change.</p><br/><p>Perhaps an after-effect of completing a forced evolution, the slight magic turbulence they had was now in perfect control.</p><br/><p>It would seem that they understood something from this battle. This is a good thing.</p><br/><p>Above all everyone\u2019s all right, I felt relieved.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood work! It\u2019s great that everyone\u2019s all right.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy word! We\u2019re unworthy of such words.</p><br/><p>We, as commanded by Rimuru sama, have survived and acquired strength!\u300d</p><br/><p>The demons that brought up these words bowed their heads in unison.</p><br/><p>Eh? Although I did say don\u2019t die, I didn\u2019t tell them to survive to the very edge though?</p><br/><p>To survive and become stronger, what are they, some battle race?!</p><br/><p>I was shocked that they thought of me as a master who would give that kind of ridiculous command.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Yeah. In any case, above all, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re all safe\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The Demons looked happy from receiving my compliments.</p><br/><p>Oh well, whatever.</p><br/><p>I should probably pay more attention from here on out, but we were in fact currently in an emergency situation. I decided to reflect on it later.</p><br/><p>I changed my mindset, and proceeded to confirmed the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s the current situation of the \u201cRat\u201d?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. It seems the \u201cRat\u201d has just arrived at the transfer device.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmm.</p><br/><p>If I wanted to stop it, now would be the time.</p><br/><p>I considered killing the \u201cRat\u201d then and there, and extracting his memory.</p><br/><p>However, individuals surpassing A rank have high resistances, and taking memories protected by the soul seemed difficult.</p><br/><p>And as for those in possession of Ultimate Skills, it\u2019d fail without a doubt.</p><br/><p>The \u201cRat\u201d had only been sneaking around, but according to Diablo a strong power was sensed from it.</p><br/><p>This was evident from the fact he managed to steal a portion of Military Uniform\u2019s abilities. (EN: refers to Kondo. Rimuru refers to him as this.)</p><br/><p>If you wanted to steal an ability (Skill) in the truest sense of the word, the other party\u2019s soul would be essential. Without that, if you only stole it from devouring a portion of the flesh, only be an inferior variant could be deconstructed\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Even so to be able to break through a section of the Spatial Interference Barrier set up by the 600 Greater Demons, he, without a doubt, wielded some sort of troublesome ability.</p><br/><p>As initially planned, the strategy was to lure out the puppeteer behind the scenes with the Emperor as bait.</p><br/><p>Thus uproot the evil at its roots.</p><br/><p>The promise to release Emperor Rudra must, of course, definitely be achieved.</p><br/><p>\u300cI shouldn\u2019t have to worry about him escaping right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufu. There is no problem!\u300d</p><br/><p>Good.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve established my objective, and gave the command.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s clean this mess up quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>The \u201cRat\u201d, taking the form of the man Gradim, Vega, pretended to protect Emperor Rudra while he activated the transfer device.</p><br/><p>Nodding towards the small number of Elite Mages and Major General Xam\u2019d staying behind to guard,</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll be going on ahead. You guys quickly make your escape too!\u300d</p><br/><p>Leaving behind these insincere words, Vega transferred, and escaped.</p><br/><p>Naturally, He brought along Emperor Rudra.</p><br/><p>After arriving at the transfer facility room within the deepest part of the Imperial palace of the Capital, Vega destroyed the transfer device.</p><br/><p>The thin, shining and mysterious magic formation was blown to pieces from the shockwaves from Vega\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>With this, connection between the Airships\u2019 transfer devices and the Imperial Capital had been severed. The demons would no longer be able to pursue Vega.</p><br/><p>Those who stayed behind would be massacred, but that was something Vega wouldn\u2019t know to care about.</p><br/><p>Vega took a breath, and a fearless, broad grin surfaced.</p><br/><p>Vega had immense self-confidence in his powers.</p><br/><p>However, he considered the Demons from earlier. The one who insta-killed Beast King Gradim, and the ones who fought with Kondo and Damrada; They were genuine monsters.</p><br/><p>Beast King Gradim was a strong individual who surpassed the average Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>However, Vega didn\u2019t think he\u2019d lose to him, and if they actually fought, he was confident in his chances of winning.</p><br/><p>However, those monsters easily surpassed Vega who had reached the upper limits of human strength as a Sage.</p><br/><p>(Fuck \u2018em! Just fuck \u2018em to to bits. Your\u2019s truly will get much stronger. Just you watch!)</p><br/><p>Although his head was fuming to the point he felt welled up with seething wrath, having suppressed his anger, he had brought the Emperor to the designated location as initially commanded.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou sure took your time, Vega. Is Emperor Rudra alright? \u300d</p><br/><p>On the throne;</p><br/><p>A chair that only the Emperor was permitted to sit on, a young boy sat on it with a relaxed look.</p><br/><p>He called out to Vega, who had just arrived, with a light-hearted tone.</p><br/><p>Black hair and Black eyes, a native Japanese look\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He was someone who should have been exterminated by Kondo, Kagurazaka Yuuki. (TN: That\u2019s one F***er I didn\u2019t miss.) (EN: I don\u2019t get the Yuuki hate, he\u2019s an awesome villain~)</p><br/><p>And standing behind him was a stoic faced beauty.</p><br/><p>But contrary to her appearance, she was the strongest Hero, Chloe O\u2019bell.</p><br/><p>Chloe was probably unwilling, as she unresponsively stood there with an uninterested look.</p><br/><p>Acting per her contract, she left an impression of indifference.</p><br/><p>\u300cHe\u2019s okay. Although his head had a few screws loose.</p><br/><p>However, that Demon Lord Rimuru sure is a monster. That guy shut me down big time.</p><br/><p>By the way, are things all right here?</p><br/><p>The coup d\u2019\u00e9tat was suppressed or something, I heard from Gradim and the others?</p><br/><p>So you\u2019re alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo I look like I\u2019m alright?</p><br/><p>I was in some serious shit over here you know?</p><br/><p>I\u2019d requested Chloe here to resurrect me on the off chance I died.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that I barely made it alive, but I actually did die.</p><br/><p>Well, thanks to that, the remaining Wishes (Commands) left on Chloe has dropped to one\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s all that Kondo and Damrada\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>Be it Damrada or Kondo, them hiding their true strength was seriously annoying. \u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki explained to Vega with exaggerated gestures.</p><br/><p>While he continued on with his tale, suddenly, he fixated his gaze on Vega,</p><br/><p>\u300cAh~man, Vega. Dude, you\u2019re being tracked aren\u2019t you?\u300d</p><br/><p>While letting out a sigh, he lamented.</p><br/><p>And then, holding his hand over Vega\u2019s back,</p><br/><p>\u300cEraser Shot!\u300d</p><br/><p>With a single hit, he eliminated Moss\u2019s clone who was performing reconnaissance on Vega.</p><br/><p>The tiny fist-sized demon, forcefully split in half, was destroyed without being able to resist.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat was a close one. A little more and they would have arrived at this place in hot pursuit.</p><br/><p>Or rather, It seems Rimuru-san\u2019s subordinates are all horrifyingly excellent for no apparent reason.</p><br/><p>We got careless for a bit there didn\u2019t we? Vega, get your act together. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yeah. I got careless there, my bad\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Vega also looked as if he was scowling. However, in reality he wasn\u2019t reflecting at all.</p><br/><p>In fact, he didn\u2019t notice it at the time since he was so wrapped up, but he felt his pride was trampled all over, he was furious to his very core. There was no room for reflecting.</p><br/><p>Quite the annoyance, it seems one must not be careless with Rimuru\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>Yuuki moved to a different location.</p><br/><p>Bringing Vega and Chloe along, he moved with transfer magic.</p><br/><p>At the Capital\u2019s outskirts, this was where corpses were organized.</p><br/><p>The location where Velgrynd entrapped and delivered pain to the Mixed Corps in the \u201cCrimson Purge\u201d, this was where the corpses of the elites directly under Yuuki lay.</p><br/><p>The fires of purgatory that wouldn\u2019t clear up no matter what, after some time, had began to weaken, and had just finally extinguished.</p><br/><p>Naturally, they looked like how they were moments before death, it looked as if they hardly managed to perform their duty\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The royal knights No.11 and below that remained in the imperial capital, had been prepared as the raw materials for Armageddon (summoning the Angel Army).</p><br/><p>If it is merely summoned, an Angel isn\u2019t a threat. Their average combat potential was only around a \u201cB+\u201d rank.</p><br/><p>Although, generally since summoned greater demons were \u201cA-\u201c rank, they were sufficiently threatening to a human country.</p><br/><p>Although they\u2019d fall short against an elite Demon Lord, a force of over 1,000,000 \u201cB+\u201d ranks would be more than sufficient.</p><br/><p>But, that\u2019s only considering the case of facing a human nation.</p><br/><p>While there was no problem against an older Demon Lord class, the current members of Octogram were on a completely different scale in terms of quality.</p><br/><p>Therefore this time, for the first time, Yuuki decided to try and incarnate the Angels using Emperor Rudra.</p><br/><p>Up until now, this execution was a taboo, but considering the fact he\u2019d lost half his mind at this point, he could be tempted put Justice King Michael\u2019s proposal was into action.</p><br/><p>The living and the dead, in order to determine the difference, both have been prepared.</p><br/><p>This place also clicked well with Yuuki\u2019s objectives.</p><br/><p>it served the purpose of cutting off pursuers, and as they had erased that tracking clone, now they felt safer.</p><br/><p>Vega comprehended Yuuki\u2019s actions, and just as he was thinking that,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is this place? What happened to the battle\u2026\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>Emperor Rudra, who was in a dazed state up until now, opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>While he was only half conscious, it seemed that he would be awaken before long.</p><br/><p>Although a bit earlier than planned, Yuuki decided to move his plan to the next phase.</p><br/><p>Yuuki gave Vega a wink, as he and Chloe hid themselves.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Vega understood Yuuki\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>This was one of several pre-determined patterns.</p><br/><p>Understanding this he quickly kneeled, and faced the emperor.</p><br/><p>While accidents piled up, this was still within expectations.</p><br/><p>Without any changes they\u2019ll be using the special Skill of Emperor Rudra\u2019s Ultimate Skill \u300eJustice King Michael\u300f, and use Armageddon.</p><br/><p>This was Vega\u2019s predetermined role.</p><br/><p>Yuuki was relieved that Vega understood.</p><br/><p>(That guy, I was anxious that he\u2019d forget since he\u2019s an idiot after all\u2026\u2026 )</p><br/><p>Contrary to his beliefs, Vega too had been equipped with the thing called \u201cbrains\u201d.</p><br/><p>Albeit boastful of his strength, when he thought about it he only recalled a few individuals whose strength exceeded Vega\u2019s. (TN: I could think of a few, like Rimuru\u2019s entire entourage. )</p><br/><p>In any case, he heaved a sigh of seeing that the strategy was going well.</p><br/><p>Vega, didn\u2019t actually listened to Yuuki\u2019s speculations in detail.</p><br/><p>However, by using the Emperor\u2019s ability, their current goals would be accomplished.</p><br/><p>In regards to Vega\u2019s role in the series of battles of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, it was the actualization of their ultimate goal, making Emperor Rudra successfully use Armageddon.</p><br/><p>Well, that was originally Yuuki\u2019s role, but since the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat plans went awry, the baton was passed onto Vega midway.</p><br/><p>If Yuuki died, then Vega would be the one to execute it.</p><br/><p>In the original plan, they\u2019d finish subjugating Ruminas, and execute it before the final clash with Guy, but due to several unforeseen incidents, the plan was pushed forward.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour Majesty, you\u2019re alright! This Gradim was so worried!\u300d</p><br/><p>While acting as Gradim, Vega explained the situation to the Emperor.</p><br/><p>The army was wiped out, Kondo, Damrada and the other Royal Knights are expected to be annihilated as well.</p><br/><p>While Velgrynd stalled for time, he somehow escaped with the Emperor; he recited the thought out scenario.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say!? Are you saying Damrada and Velgrynd are still fighting?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, your Majesty! Kondo-dono as well as Damrada-dono are currently engaged in a fight to the death\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Is that so. Then, before it\u2019s too late, we must rescue them.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll summon the angels. Make the preparations!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, your Majesty\u2026\u2026!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Without letting it show, a smile surfaced on the face under that helmet.</p><br/><p>Although he wondered would the Emperor would actually perform the angel summoning, it looked like things were going well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just a little more, and it\u2019s over\u2019 he thought, a natural smile broke through his fa\u00e7ade.</p><br/><p>But, that though was simply too na\u00efve.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh my? That would be troublesome. \u2015\u2015Besides, there\u2019s no need to rescue them.</p><br/><p>After all, those two are already dead.\u300d</p><br/><p>A beautiful voice resounded in Vega\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be! Vega thought as he tried to deny the notion that just came to mind.</p><br/><p>But, as if ridiculing his actions,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, you. You dare ruin Your\u2019s truly\u2019s fun?</p><br/><p>Your life isn\u2019t enough to make up for this \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>So kindly cry out in pain and agony to sooth my heart.\u300d</p><br/><p>As if out of nowhere, somebody suddenly appeared behind his back.</p><br/><p>And then, he notice the feeling of a muzzle thrust towards his head.</p><br/><p>Despite there being a helmet over his head, for some reason he clearly felt it.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-wait!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRepent as you\u2019re trapped in fear! \u201cResentment Fear (Cursed Prison of Resentment and Fear)\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>With even his soul devoured, he faced endless torture by the ghoul horde.</p><br/><p>The pinnacle of anti-individual mind break magic, a synthesis of Extinction King Abaddon, and a Necrosis bullet, was shot.</p><br/><p>The pistol, large and crude in the hands of a lady, was fired.</p><br/><p>Being an enlarged variant of the one Kondo once held, it\u2019s expected power would also increase.</p><br/><p>The effects of the magic sealed within the bullets shot from the large pistol was released in the interior of Vega\u2019s skull.</p><br/><p>With a single hit, Vega\u2019s flesh was corroded by the curse; His soul, becoming prisoner to endless agony.</p><br/><p>\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>Uo\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Not given a chance to explain himself, he was shot without hesitation\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>As expect of Carrera.</p><br/><p>Another name on the ranking of individuals to never, ever, anger.</p><br/><p>Or rather, putting the gentlemanly Diablo aside, the ones like Testarossa and Carrera are pretty scary huh.</p><br/><p>In that aspect, I\u2019m so glad Ultima was calm and collected.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s hard to believe she\u2019s a Demon.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s been called \u300cOjou-sama\u300d by her subordinates, her main aide was her butler too, she looks to have obviously been raised well.</p><br/><p>She probably has all lot of influence.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, she might even be the Demon King\u2019s daughter.</p><br/><p>(TN: the raw also uses  here, but since this one\u2019s obviously not referring to the Demon Nobles or the Octagram members, I translated it as demon king instead to avoid confusion.)</p><br/><p>This is no good.</p><br/><p>Looking at Carrera hunting the \u201cRat\u201d without hesitation, I began to wander away in though.</p><br/><p>They had requested to allow them to end the Emperor and the \u201cRat\u201d, and I\u2019d given them permission, but the result was this.</p><br/><p>But well, the remaining one would be the one that bit the Emperor bait huh.</p><br/><p>Ultima was fired up about killing the emperor, and came over to me, wishing to do it.</p><br/><p>So I decided to hand it to her.</p><br/><p>and Thus, my opponent would be the mastermind.</p><br/><p>\u300cOy, stop hiding and come out. You\u2019re there aren\u2019t you? Yuuki!\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked facing the darkness,</p><br/><p>\u300cGood grief, was I exposed? Can\u2019t expect less of Rimuru-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki said as he came out.</p><br/><p>Just like how he was back in the Royal Capital, with a nonchalant look, and a light-hearted feel as if he was meeting an old friend.</p><br/><p>But I can\u2019t leave him alone. He\u2019s too dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u300cI guess. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re doing well.</p><br/><p>By the way, any last words before you die?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAhahahaha. Straight to the point eh, Rimuru san. But you think I die so easily?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo I don\u2019t, but you\u2019ve gone overboard.</p><br/><p>But, if you don\u2019t do anymore than this, we could settle with just sealing you\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>So what do you say? Your freedom will be restricted, but it\u2019s better than dying right? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNa\u00efve, still too na\u00efve. You haven\u2019t changed at all, still a goodie too-shoes\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019s best you stop thinking you\u2019ve won! \u300d</p><br/><p>it was impossible as expected huh.</p><br/><p>I thought it was impossible right from the start.</p><br/><p>However, there\u2019s the matter of freeing Chloe, and him making some strange Wish (Command) of her would only cause the situation to take a turn for the worse.</p><br/><p>I wanted to try managing the situation in order to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen, but I guess it was impossible.</p><br/><p>We faced each other, and quietly prepared ourselves.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

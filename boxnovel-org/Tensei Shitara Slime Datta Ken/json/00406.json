I had to pay some ridiculous reparations too. Honestly, I was starting to get angry just thinking about it. It was all Veldora's fault.</p><br/><p>Recently, I had felt that Veldora was lacking in restraint, but I suppose he had really been doing his best. It could not be helped.</p><br/><p>It was a good thing to be reminded of what would happen when he did forget.</p><br/><p>The miracle did not end there.</p><br/><p>\"Now, it's my turn! Elemental: The World!!\"</p><br/><p>Ramiris shouted triumphantly as she used her power.</p><br/><p>She stole more than a little of my 'Nihility Collapse' energy and used it to transform into an adult.</p><br/><p>A beautiful, young woman-of course, the reality was that she was the same disappointing Ramiris who had the heart of a child.</p><br/><p>Ramiris sung.</p><br/><p>And her beautiful voice woke up the sleeping spirits.</p><br/><p>And then-</p><br/><p>The earth was blessed and regained the appearance of its golden age.</p><br/><p>Flowers bloomed on the ground. The air became thick and sweet. It became a paradise for the spirits that could not be seen with human eyes.</p><br/><p>This way, they wouldn't be forced to develop dangerous things. The gifts of nature would bring new life.</p><br/><p>It was quite impressive.</p><br/><p>Ramiris really was the queen of the spirits.</p><br/><p>Had she stayed like this all of the time, there would be no reason to despise her. It was too bad!</p><br/><p>I only lent her my power. I would take it back as soon as she was finished.</p><br/><p>Of course, she would definitely complain about it, but it was not good for her to have this power when she hadn't grown mentally.</p><br/><p>It was for her own good.</p><br/><p>And like that, the planet was reborn.</p><br/><p>They would be able to live without fighting each other for food and water.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Now\u2026</p><br/><p>It was unlikely that Veldora and Ramiris, who were preoccupied with their work, would need any protection, but I still left it to Beretta.</p><br/><p>And then I turned back to Michelle, who I had been neglecting.</p><br/><p>Michelle and the others had become speechless. Their eyes were glued to the scene before them.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\"Ah, sorry to keep you waiting.\"</p><br/><p>I said. Michelle turned to me with a look of surprise.</p><br/><p>Yes, yes. I understand.</p><br/><p>She was exasperated how ridiculous Veldora and the others were.</p><br/><p>I could see a giant building behind them that had smoke rising from one of the upper floors. Apparently, it was also Veldora's doing.</p><br/><p>Michelle looked like she had a lot she wanted to say.</p><br/><p>However, I was in no mood to hear it.</p><br/><p>I had sworn never again to make the same mistake that I did with Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Take your complaints to the man himself!</p><br/><p>And so I decided to tell them what I wanted to say and that alone.</p><br/><p>\"I think this planet will be restored soon if you leave things to those two. I hope you can then forgive them for everything they did.\"</p><br/><p>After I said this, all of the people including Michelle began to shake their heads vertically at an incredible speed.</p><br/><p>This gesture seemed to have the same meaning here, so I guess they agreed.</p><br/><p>So there would be no problems left between our worlds.</p><br/><p>The only thing left was\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Also, I have a suggestion if you don't mind? It seems like you want to execute this Fudora guy. In that case, give him to me. I'll punish him for you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>That punishment would be being put in Ramiris's research team.</p><br/><p>I could expect advancements in our technology, which was more than I could ask for.</p><br/><p>The airships in this world seemed like they could fly in space as well. The possibilities were endless.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this was counting my eggs before they hatched, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Pl-please wait! Would you please reconsider sentencing Lord Fudora to divine punishment!?\"</p><br/><p>A beautiful youth\u2014called Alvin, said as he kneeled before me.</p><br/><p>Divine punishment? That was an exaggeration.</p><br/><p>I thought. But judging by their reactions, it seemed like the others feared me as well.</p><br/><p>This was probably because Veldora had shown his abilities as a dragon.</p><br/><p>They clearly saw me as being in the same class. Oh, well.</p><br/><p>\"No, no, no. It's nothing like that\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Lord Fudora is\u2026</p><br/><p>I tried to explain, but Alvin began his passionate speech.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>What it contained just confirmed what I had already guessed.</p><br/><p>Almsbine, the previous emperor, had been suffering from a fatal disease, and so Fudora acted in his stead.</p><br/><p>Fudora respected Almsbine and didn't want his reputation to be tarnished. And so he decided to take all of the blame.</p><br/><p>Well, it was a complicated problem.</p><br/><p>The world was dying.</p><br/><p>Should everyone die?</p><br/><p>Or should a small minority survive?</p><br/><p>When asked these questions, which answer was the right one?</p><br/><p>An administrator's job was to protect their people.</p><br/><p>If was said that if you abandoned the citizens you were supposed to keep safe, then problems would arise for your government.</p><br/><p>It would become a source of trouble in the future. An unbridgeable gap would exist between ruler and citizens.</p><br/><p>As men of science, Almsbine and Fudora did not hesitate to choose the path of a small number of survivors.</p><br/><p>It was the logical way to think, once you took emotion out of it.</p><br/><p>However, it was a decision too heavy for a person to bear.</p><br/><p>\u2014However, they needed a sacrificial lamb.</p><br/><p>That's why Fudora was going to settle everything and entrust Michelle with his hopes for the future.</p><br/><p>\"Is that true, brother?\"</p><br/><p>\"Aye, it is true, Michelle.\"</p><br/><p>Alvin nodded to her as he finished his defense of Fudora.</p><br/><p>Fudora was sagging as if drained of all of his strength.</p><br/><p>And so I patted him on the shoulder and nodded to him reassuringly.</p><br/><p>Then I turned to Michelle and the others and said plainly:</p><br/><p>\"Please don't worry. There won't be anything so extravagant as divine punishment. But I am taking this man with me so you can ascend to the seat of Emperor and unite the world.\"</p><br/><p>If that's what I have to say to get a new researcher! That was my true feelings on the matter.</p><br/><p>However, their reaction was different from what I was expecting.</p><br/><p>\"Ohh\u2026 He will entrust the sovereign right to General Michelle\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Am I really worthy?\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Uh, I think so?\"</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

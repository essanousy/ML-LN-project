The current core members. Kaijin also speaking on behalf the Construction and Manufacturing departments.</p><br/><p>Department of Production is supervised by Ririna.</p><br/><p>Department of Governance has Rigurdo at the top, and three chiefs making up the judicial, legislative, and executive branches.</p><br/><p>However, this particular department is not completely established yet\u2026</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s a problem for the future.</p><br/><p>Department of War by Benimaru and Hakurou.</p><br/><p>Department of Intelligence by Souei.</p><br/><p>Department of Defense by Rigur.</p><br/><p>At present, we have only six departments active in our city.</p><br/><p>Well, though I say \u201cactive\u201d, they are so in name only; however, it\u2019s probably a good idea to slowly develop them.</p><br/><p>Currently, everyone is living with little worry about food.</p><br/><p>The department of defense is also regulating hunting, so that sector should be fine.</p><br/><p>If I think about it, Rigur is handling things well. He\u2019s one of those unsung heroes, isn\u2019t he.</p><br/><p>Frankly, about the department of war, Benimaru knows nothing except numbers of soldiers when it comes to the art of war.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s an appointment in name only. It was something that I had to do.</p><br/><p>Ririna shows promise. After obtaining a potato-like plant, she succeeded in its cultivation.</p><br/><p>With short harvest cycles, and high nutritional value, it will improve our food supply.</p><br/><p>In the future, when we trade with the humans, we should obtain many different vegetable seeds.</p><br/><p>The construction and manufacturing departments are completely left to Kaijin.</p><br/><p>He normally specializes in smithing, but after Kurobee joined, he ended up in a managerial position.</p><br/><p>Seems like Kaijin has been completely separated from his field of expertise. However, he had entrusted it all to Kurobee.</p><br/><p>According to Kaijin, they are still busy with establishing the smithy, but once things calm down, he\u2019ll devote himself fully to production. That\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>He probably wants to come back soon.</p><br/><p>Shion is in charge of my care? I kind of want to rethink that post, but right now, no matter where we put her, it\u2019ll be bad for my heart.</p><br/><p>For now, let\u2019s wait and see.</p><br/><p>And, about Souei.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s strange.</p><br/><p>I know I appointed him as a ninja\u2026 but he\u2019s taking it too seriously.</p><br/><p>He can make clones appear from any direction.</p><br/><p>While their abilities drop, they have no movement restrictions. Furthermore, he can deploy six clones without any restrictions.</p><br/><p>And even if I say their abilities decrease, that\u2019s only about their vigor (HP) and magical energy (MP)\u2013it becomes 1/10th of original. Their movement abilities and attack power are completely unchanged.</p><br/><p>An ability superior to mine.</p><br/><p>Actually, all the Oni are strange.</p><br/><p>Souei, as I had just described.</p><br/><p>Shuna had specialized in my Analysis Ability, and awakened to the unique skill [Analytic].</p><br/><p>Our abilities are basically identical, with the exception that she doesn\u2019t need to eat the target. She can analyze with eyesight alone.</p><br/><p>Kurobee had awakened to the unique skill [Researcher]. This skill also bears great semblance to my own.</p><br/><p>As someone who specializes in production, it is a very useful skill.</p><br/><p>Hakurou has had his perception ability accelerated by a a thousand times. So I basically can\u2019t see him losing in a battle.</p><br/><p>Shion, as you\u2019d expect, obtained [Herculean Strength EX] and [Physical Strength EX].</p><br/><p>Moreover, she also awakened to a special skill [Battle Craze] that she should absolutely never use.</p><br/><p>Last up, Benimaru. This bastard learned [Black Lightning] of all things. Seriously! Of all the dangerous skills I did not want circulating!</p><br/><p>I think I\u2019ll need to come up with some countermeasures.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, they seem to have inherited my skills and completed their evolution.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s start the conference.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, let\u2019s hear the report.\u300d</p><br/><p>Upon my order, Souei began conveying the state of affairs.</p><br/><p>Everyone silently listened.</p><br/><p>He sent out six clones to gather intel</p><br/><p>1. Goblin Villages</p><br/><p>2. State of the marshes</p><br/><p>3. State of the Orc army</p><br/><p>He seems to have sent two clones to each location.</p><br/><p>First, the Goblin villages have decided to join the Lizardmen\u2019s raid leader Gabil as his warriors.</p><br/><p>Probably that lizard from some time ago.</p><br/><p>To have decided to serve that moron, what weird tastes they have. Those that decided against joining him, have ran away in various direction.</p><br/><p>There were also a few that ran in the direction of human countries, but they\u2019ll probably end up as subjugation targets.</p><br/><p>As long as goblins establish their communities in the forest, the humans would stay away, but if you invade their territory, they would surely bare their fangs.</p><br/><p>And while I don\u2019t know the humans\u2019 strength, they will surely order a subjugation quickly.</p><br/><p>When they do, the goblins could only continue living in hiding. Their future looks grim.</p><br/><p>While on this topic, I also listened to the report about Gabil.</p><br/><p>Somehow, the goblins he had gathered numbered 7,000 warriors.</p><br/><p>A decent army.</p><br/><p>As we had gathered, they once appealed to the orcs, but were rejected. At least they can use their head a bit.</p><br/><p>However, they were also forced to take along with them all their food, so even if they survive against the orcs, there will surely be people dying afterwards.</p><br/><p>But we won\u2019t be doing anything about that.</p><br/><p>That was the unanimous decision of their clan chiefs who decided that such a fate was better than being murdered by the orcs.</p><br/><p>And besides, we are not an NPO.</p><br/><p>We have only begun establishing this city, but abandoning it would not be fun.</p><br/><p>If we allow the orcs to invade this far, the forest ecosystem would probably collapse&gt;</p><br/><p>Which is why we must stop them at the marshes.</p><br/><p>Now about the marshes.</p><br/><p>Here, the Lizardmen\u2019s Head had begun assembling troops, and prepared an army of ten thousand.</p><br/><p>Living off the lake\u2019s fish, they have an abundance of food.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they are barricading themselves in their natural labyrinth in preparation of any attack.</p><br/><p>But are the orcs an enemy that they should so fear?</p><br/><p>So let\u2019s hear about the orcs.</p><br/><p>The orc army, numbering 200,000.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? 200,000?!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I thoughtlessly let out my voice.</p><br/><p>The orcs who attacked the ogres numbered only ten thousand\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cSo the ones who attacked our village was but a single division?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight. After investigating, that much became clear. Their army consists of 200,000 warriors! Coming from the south, they took a relatively wide route and are aiming for the marshes.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmm. I don\u2019t really know the geography yet.</p><br/><p>\u300cSouei, do you have a map or something?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat would a map be?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300c\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb???\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>What did he say?</p><br/><p>For there to be so few people who know about maps\u2026</p><br/><p>Kaijin had known. He knew of them, but none in circulation.</p><br/><p>Seems like this world is treating maps as a military secret.</p><br/><p>Hakurou\u2019s grandfather had drawn the map of the village\u2019s surrounding on a block of wood.</p><br/><p>Having no paper hurts.</p><br/><p>Anyways, holding a wood block, we\u2019ll carve the map of our city\u2019s vicinity.</p><br/><p>Using the map in my head, and Rigur\u2019s knowledge, we have Hakurou record the information.</p><br/><p>This way, using all our knowledge, we created a half-way decent map.</p><br/><p>Before even getting to the main issue of the conference, we had wasted two hours on map creation.</p><br/><p>And here we took a short break.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t need it, but the goblins probably do.</p><br/><p>Shuna brought in a tray of food.</p><br/><p>Following her, a group of girls followed with more trays.</p><br/><p>I changed into my child form.</p><br/><p>Maybe rest is unnecessary, but meals are important. Since I have this human form, I might as well eat while tasting.</p><br/><p>\u2026, as long as it\u2019s not made by Shion, that is.</p><br/><p>Since getting used to human transformation, I managed to transform already wearing clothing. Seems like practice really does wonders.</p><br/><p>A feast was laid before me.</p><br/><p>And for some reason, Shuna had sat right by me. Just in case, I have to check\u2026</p><br/><p>The appearance is normal, but what about the inside? Clearly lacking spices, seems like a bunch of ingredients were stir-fried together\u2026</p><br/><p>Who cooked this? I felt a sharp glance from my side.</p><br/><p>Gulp. Somehow, I\u2019m getting very nervous.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s eat!\u300d</p><br/><p>Until I had said it, nobody moved.</p><br/><p>Seems like if I don\u2019t eat first, nobody will begin. I had been hoping that someone would finally eat, but seems like I need to steel myself.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s fine. Shion did not make this!</p><br/><p>However, I kind of regret changing into a form that has a sense of taste.</p><br/><p>With those thought, I reached for the food. But not with chopsticks, since we only had spoons.</p><br/><p>Bringing some soup to my mouth, I take a sip\u2026 it was delicious.</p><br/><p>\u300cDelicious!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The moment I said so, everyone moved.</p><br/><p>But hey\u2026 you guys, how can you just watch your lord drink poison! Though it\u2019s not poison per se\u2026</p><br/><p>And I also have a resistance to most poisons\u2026</p><br/><p>However, I want to be a bit more considerate.</p><br/><p>Chances are, Shuna had pulled some strings ahead of time\u2026</p><br/><p>Upon hearing my praise, Shuna\u2019s face lit up in a full smile.</p><br/><p>Grabbing my plate, she insisted to feed me.</p><br/><p>Seeming a bit happy, and a bit embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Though I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019m a child at heart. Appearance that of a little girl. Even if I let her feed me, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.</p><br/><p>*Fufun* A victory laugh escaped from Shuna while she glanced at Shion.</p><br/><p>Tears seem to have started to form in Shion\u2019s eyes, but her expression quickly turned to that of surprise after she had tasted the dish.</p><br/><p>Right, Shuna. If you polish your cooking skills a bit more, they\u2019ll really shine.</p><br/><p>You\u2019d never consider putting strange things into people food!</p><br/><p>Even without seasoning, to be able to bring out the taste of the ingredients this well.</p><br/><p>But was Benimaru a test subject for the many dishes before this? That I could not have known about.</p><br/><p>Well, Shuna was probably a cooking prodigy. She could probably perfect the taste using her [Analytic] skill.</p><br/><p>That isn\u2019t a waste of ability, that\u2019s the proper way to use it.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I last enjoyed a meal this much.</p><br/><p>With the end of the meal comes the end of our break.</p><br/><p>We have a pretty good time.</p><br/><p>But now we need to get down to business.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe object that clearly explains the nearby geography is called a map. Looking at this map, let\u2019s continue the report.\u300d</p><br/><p>Having said so, everyone crowded around the map.</p><br/><p>Well, I can also transmit the image to everyone using [Telepathic Communication].</p><br/><p>Souei marked the orcs army with a wooden chip.</p><br/><p>I was in the middle of teaching goblins basic arithmetic, so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll understand all of this.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s nothing we can do about that, we need to continue the discussion.</p><br/><p>The orcs\u2019 invasion route.</p><br/><p>There are three routes leading to the center of the Jura forest that the orcs could use.</p><br/><p>One runs from the Canaat Mountain range. The other along Ameld river. These connect north forest and south forest.</p><br/><p>But this is not a straight path, as the river runs east along the way.</p><br/><p>They could probably have the soldiers cross at the place where Ameld river meets the Eastern Empire\u2019s river.</p><br/><p>However, there is no route that could support a large army from the orcs\u2019 current position.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they probably decided to invade the marsh from the west.</p><br/><p>However, the forest will hamper their attempts to move beyond the river.</p><br/><p>According to Hakurou, there is a community of Treants in this forest, so avoiding them would leave the orcs\u2019 army less exhausted.</p><br/><p>The western route had the Ogre\u2019s village, but its fate is common knowledge now.</p><br/><p>They were a high class race, but too few in number. Thus, the orcs decided to avoid the route with the Treants, who were similarly high classed but many.</p><br/><p>And, after eliminating the ogres, they opened the invasion route to the marshes and were now planning their formation.</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, with 200,000 soldiers, how are they keeping them fed? What are they doing about food?\u300d</p><br/><p>To my question,</p><br/><p>\u300cI looked into it. A group of common foot soldiers escorts caravans of food. However, there is clearly not enough\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>With some hesitation, he quickly added</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is but my opinion, but I think they\u2019ve had deaths from starvation and resorted to cannibalism of the dead\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>What an unpleasant thing he had said.</p><br/><p>Uee\u2026 were orcs such a race?</p><br/><p>\u300cNo matter how omni\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey do indeed eat anything, but isn\u2019t this much expected?\u300d</p><br/><p>To that question,</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I am not certain about this. However, there are no bodies after they leave. And our village has also been wiped clean, without anything remaining.</p><br/><p>There is a skill that comes to mind, but\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Having realized the truth, Souei said.</p><br/><p>\u300cCould it be\u2026 Orc Lord?\u300d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Souei\u2019s response, Benimaru concluded.</p><br/><p>\u300cExactly. This is not certain, but there\u2019s a good chance the Orc Lord had appeared.</p><br/><p>At the very least, a high class Orc Knight is leading them.</p><br/><p>Probably that thing that had attacked our village.\u300d</p><br/><p>To summarize the conversation, the Orc Lord is a unique monster that hold powerful ruling abilities over the orcs.</p><br/><p>Appears once every few hundred years. Causing violence across the world, a horrible monster.</p><br/><p>And he seems to possess the unique skill [Starving Ones].</p><br/><p>This skill, bestowed upon his subordinates as well, allows them to eat anything and everything in sight. A truly terrible skills.</p><br/><p>In the first place, not enough time had passed since the last one\u2026</p><br/><p>But now, he\u2019s already grown and prepared an army. If he lacks some intelligence, then there\u2019s a high chance that the demon lord had forcefully accelerated his growth.</p><br/><p>In any case, the orc lord is a troubling existence.</p><br/><p>Such an annoying guy should\u2019ve been put down long ago\u2026</p><br/><p>But I will not complain.</p><br/><p>While keeping the existence of the orc lord in mind, we continue the conference.</p><br/><p>Arranging wooden pieces on the map in place of pawns, we mark the Lizardmen army of 10.000.</p><br/><p>Behind them, Gabil\u2019s army of 7,000 goblins.</p><br/><p>Having done so, we clearly see what is abnormal about the orc army\u2026</p><br/><p>But more importantly.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis way, that stupid lizard\u2019s headquarters would fall from a single attack, wouldn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>Right. The lizardmen\u2019s envoy called Gabil.</p><br/><p>That guy is planning on attacking the lizardmen\u2019s fortress while they are preoccupied fighting with the orcs. The exhausted and few lizardmen there would surely fall quickly.</p><br/><p>That is how wonderfully the goblins are positioned.</p><br/><p>However, there is no reason to attack his own lizard.</p><br/><p>It could be just suspicion born out of the strange place he had halted his troops.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm. So that\u2019s how it is.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hakurou nodded. A strange fire burned in his eyes.</p><br/><p>However, even if they bring down the headquarters then, they would be trampled down by the orcs.</p><br/><p>I am thinking too much, aren\u2019t I.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m just thinking too much. Sorry, I\u2019m an amateur after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>I had planned to continue the discussion after those words, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, what you said is likely. I can think of no other reason to assume that position.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat guy is an idiot after all. He\u2019s probably intending to replace the current head.\u300d</p><br/><p>Such was the opinion from both members of the Department of War.</p><br/><p>I mean, I know he\u2019s an idiot\u2026 but was he that much of an idiot?</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, in this case, stopping that guy is probably the best idea.\u300d</p><br/><p>That was the conclusion we had reached.</p><br/><p>Now then, how should we stop Gabil?</p><br/><p>\u300cI would want to establish a proper alliance with the Lizardmen. We are few in numbers. However, I feel we shouldn\u2019t abandon them.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hakurou so added, and everyone accepted.</p><br/><p>I also agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, forming an alliance is good and all, but we\u2019re far too outnumbered here. Won\u2019t we just be used in the end?\u300d</p><br/><p>I tried expressing my worries.</p><br/><p>The Oni exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, calm your fears! Each one of us is capable of decimating ten thousand foes, this much is of no concern!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hakurou answered as their representative.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey read too much manga\u2026 no way they can take on ten thousand each!\u201d Is what I thought, but</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, I plan to go an negotiate. To have a discussion directly with the Lizardmen\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Would you permit me?\u300d</p><br/><p>Souei had so asked, and waited for my response.</p><br/><p>How confident! Should I try leaving it to him?</p><br/><p>Using the map, we had made some predictions. That allowed us some temporary mental respite.</p><br/><p>I decided to send out Souei.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright! In that case, I order you to talk with the Lizardmen\u2019s Head. Demand equal treatment!\u300d</p><br/><p>With those words, I sent out Souei.</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! I live to serve!\u300d</p><br/><p>With that response, he immediately disappeared into the shadows.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s quick on his feet. Seems to have left already.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe rest, with these things in mind, continue preparations!\u300d</p><br/><p>Those words ended the conference.</p><br/><p>In some sense, we have decided next course of action.</p><br/><p>If we can form an alliance that would be great, and if we can\u2019t, we\u2019ll cross that bridge then.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no use thinking about those things. Rather, we must do what can now be done.</p><br/><p>And thus we continued our preparations while waiting for the next piece to move on the board.</p><br/><p>But an orc lord, huh. If he truly had appeared, that\u2019ll probably be an annoying fight.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the future made me fall slightly into melancholy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

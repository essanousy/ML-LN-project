I don\u2019t think so, why?</p><br/><p>Smoggy: Whether I visit the local fish markets, I always see the humans running the other direction, screaming:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?!

By the way, the psychopath in the picture kinda looks like you\u2026</p><br/><p>Yuuka:No idea.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Life in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>Chapter 59: The Church Moved</p><br/><p>The Devil Grucius was patrolling around the forest when a sudden incoming telepathic communication confused him.</p><br/><p>\u300cHm? Is something wrong? \u300d</p><br/><p>Several of his teammates from the frontier garrison who were worried about him asked him simultaneously.</p><br/><p>These good-hearted fellows, not doubting that I\u2019m a devil. Unaware about it himself, Grucius sees the illusion of real companions in them.</p><br/><p>\u300cNothing, I\u2019m fine\u300d</p><br/><p>I replied thus, and they were relieved.</p><br/><p>Nothing\u2019s wrong whatsoever, that\u2019s outrageous.</p><br/><p>I am now receiving the contents of the telepathic communication.</p><br/><p>(Grucius! It\u2019s an emergency. When the time comes, act in accordance to your judgement! We are currently at war. I\u2019ll contact you again when we win. Until then, you\u2019re free!)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt, something\u2019s happening.</p><br/><p>This is the first time I\u2019ve heard panic in demon Karion\u2019s voice. Just who is his opponent?</p><br/><p>It was irritating and I can\u2019t think of anything.</p><br/><p>What should I do? He told me to make my own decisions, but I can\u2019t think of any measures.</p><br/><p>After that I tried to telepathically communicate just in case, but nothing came out of it.|</p><br/><p>Grucius\u2019s heart was gradually filled with anxiety while paying attention in order to prevent his teammates from realizing his unrest.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>The face of demon lord Clayman was filled joy after receiving the report.</p><br/><p>Karion was the one who tried to persuade Milim, but it somehow ended up as a battle.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s good. Indeed, there are few demon lords that will still be merciful after being annoyed.</p><br/><p>According to the report, Milim triumphed over Karion with overwhelming combat prowess, and even blew away the royal castle, Morotomo.</p><br/><p>Rapporteur Frey said so while elegantly drinking tea.</p><br/><p>The other devils apart from Frey, who were spies, all reported the same thing.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt.</p><br/><p>Demon lord Karion is dead. Even a strong demon lord such as Karion was no problem if you have \u201cAbsolute power\u201d (Milim Nava) in your hands.</p><br/><p>The 10 great demon lords who ruled over Makai.</p><br/><p>Among them, 3 individuals including myself grouped as 1, now, 1 member has disappeared.</p><br/><p>Moreover, to have tried to threaten the absolute strongest, the last moments of the demon lord Karion will be good publicity.</p><br/><p>\u300cKukuku, everything is going on smoothly, just as planned. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAra? Is that so? I am glad that I was of use. \u300d</p><br/><p>Frey stood up and gave words of agreement without having ulterior motives.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll be going back, but what about Milim? From the looks of the battle, any devil trying to settle the matter will be ripped to shreds? \u300d</p><br/><p>Tsk. With a frown on her face, Frey looked at Clayman.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt will probably be fine for you to take care of it. After all, you and her are friends right? I entrust it to you, please accept it. If my castle is destroyed, I wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it. \u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing such words, Frey goes\u300cYare, yare \u300d while shaking her head.</p><br/><p>\u300cEven though I don\u2019t want my house to be destroyed? Well, it\u2019s useless no matter what I say right? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s great you understand. You may go! \u300d</p><br/><p>That attitude shows that he doesn\u2019t even treat Frey as an equal anymore, but rather a subordinate under his rule.</p><br/><p>Frey didn\u2019t show any signs of discomfort in her expression, she sent a piercing gaze at Clayman and left.</p><br/><p>A smile appeared on Clayman\u2019s face after making sure that Frey left.</p><br/><p>Everything is going well.</p><br/><p>Everything is going according to the plan of \u201cthat person\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike a prophecy, things don\u2019t always go as predicted, but progress is smoothly made.</p><br/><p>In the original plan, the Orc lord was designated as the new demon lord. The reason for backing this plan was in order to manipulate the said demon lord.</p><br/><p>Since our interest met, we both decided to work together. Even if the plan fails, there are no losses.</p><br/><p>But then, a suspicious monster appeared, and it created a monster town. As soon as this was known, the plan was modified to utilize the town.</p><br/><p>To use our common interest as bait, using the monsters in that town as bait.</p><br/><p>The bait was bit, and luckily the one who bit it was the strongest demon lord.</p><br/><p>Clayman started his plan, first, by intercepting a multi-layered barrier.</p><br/><p>Then, as usual, he carries out his periodic report.</p><br/><p>A trustworthy partner.</p><br/><p>He has sworn his allegiance to the true master\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Ever since Myulan joined the Frontier Garrison, every day was an extremely busy day.</p><br/><p>Just because she took up the duty of a shaman, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019d be any less busy. Sometimes an individual curious about the dark arts would come along, and she would teach them.</p><br/><p>If they were simple curses, she could teach them. Before she became a devil she was originally a witch. Teaching curses used by humans is a simple task.</p><br/><p>What she was busy with was as a staff officer, another one of her positions.</p><br/><p>In the first place, asking a newcomer to take up the position as the staff officer is not a good idea\u2026</p><br/><p>(To put trust in a devil, these people are overly good-natured!)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s probably the impression she had if she were to put it in words.</p><br/><p>Giving commands for the platoon to meet up in the monster\u2019s city, and reporting to the captain. She\u2019s been handling all that.</p><br/><p>To think of her as irresponsible is virtually impossible.</p><br/><p>Even so, in the midst of all the discomfort, there were also a lot of thoughts.</p><br/><p>After interacting with people for a while, long- forgotten feelings started to resurface.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cMyulan, is it fine? Please tell me your response soon! \u300d</p><br/><p>Said by a man courting her, she looked back at Youmu.</p><br/><p>From the start, I felt his gaze when I infiltrated the Frontier garrison.</p><br/><p>I was on alert whether we were discovered, but Grucius said he didn\u2019t fell anything.</p><br/><p>What is happening? When I was thinking about that, Youmu gazed over here. When our eyes met, he looked away in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>But recently, not only his attitude but even his words contain hints of courtship.</p><br/><p>He said,</p><br/><p>\u300cI love you. Please date me! You will definitely be happy, I promise! \u300d</p><br/><p>ED: That\u2019s not a hint \ud83d\ude04</p><br/><p>He threw a straight ball.</p><br/><p>Even though he usually has a frivolous attitude, he was actually serious. He hasn\u2019t made any moves until now.</p><br/><p>The times when I was just a young girl, which would have been 700 years ago. I can\u2019t remember much from back then, I don\u2019t have any memories of interacting with other people.</p><br/><p>To be honest, the experience called love is something that girl has no experience with whatsoever.</p><br/><p>There was more joy than anxiety. Moreover\u2026</p><br/><p>(He said he promises happiness\u2026</p><br/><p>Even though my heart is held in the hands of Clayman. I can\u2019t, No it can\u2019t! Besides\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>How could a human fall in love with me?)</p><br/><p>In the end, she postponed the reply.</p><br/><p>I refuse! Her reasons tell her so, but for some reason she couldn\u2019t muster the courage to say it.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s been a devil for 400 years, but this is the first time she felt such insecurity.</p><br/><p>In such a state, Myulan was contacted by Clayman.</p><br/><p>For the devil Myulan, Clayman isn\u2019t the target of her loyalty.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s possible she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pull off a dirty trick. However, against that sly demon lord, such a chance will probably never appear.</p><br/><p>The last time she reported, she rememebed that Clayman was in a strangely good mood, and felt uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>He probably came up with something devious, she thought.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, she has no countermeasures. It\u2019s not something she can openly go up against.</p><br/><p>Even if someone is feeling unhappy, there is no way for them to save themselves. Having unpleasant feelings about this is natural.</p><br/><p>And suddenly she received contact.</p><br/><p>(You appear healthy. Thanks to the information you bought, everything is going smoothly here. Good job. Even though I have been keeping your heart for you, I think I might return it soon.)</p><br/><p>A sudden offer.</p><br/><p>Myulan suddenly felt exhilarated. But panicking wouldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>Her opponent is a Demon lord. To even trick those working under him without shame, he is certainly the wicked Marionette Master.</p><br/><p>(Wow! Thank you very much!)</p><br/><p>That would be the safe answer.</p><br/><p>(There\u2019s no need for you to be cautious. What? I just have one last thing I want you to do. Until then, keep enjoying your leisurely life. Now then, see ya)</p><br/><p>She was spoken to without being able to reply, and the connection was cut.</p><br/><p>Is this a trap? There\u2019s no way to confirm it.</p><br/><p>Doing what she has done so far, she simply followed orders.</p><br/><p>However, if I really was released\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(I wonder would I have accepted him?)</p><br/><p>With a uneasy feeling in her chest, Myulan resumed and acted as if nothing has happened.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Sakaguchi Hinata awakened from her light nap in a sleepy state.</p><br/><p>Diligently serving her, Nicolas had brought her a cup of coffee.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, have you awakened? \u300d</p><br/><p>Cardinal Nicolas Spertus.</p><br/><p>He is the man who sits at the pinnacle of the western religion, the sacred, inviolable, confidant pope of the holy kingdom Ruberios.</p><br/><p>To Hinata, that man is as faithful as a tamed puppy.</p><br/><p>They shared a bed yesterday, and even allowed him to be her companion overnight.</p><br/><p>Without getting tired, she looked at him who licked her body clean.</p><br/><p>TN Note:\u2026that\u2019s what the translations are saying\u2026 It\u2019s turning into an ero novel.</p><br/><p>(Really, just like a dog\u2026)</p><br/><p>That was what Hinata though.</p><br/><p>He worships Hinata, as if she was a goddess or a saint. An idiotic man, Hinata though.</p><br/><p>(Even I would excrete after I eat. After a year, it\u2019s natural for me to age. It\u2019s not like my body would remain beautiful forever. All this man is looking at is a mere fantasy)</p><br/><p>He desires her body. It\u2019s cheap. Even though I don\u2019t think this body is worth that much, he can do whatever he wants with it.</p><br/><p>To her, her body is merely a mean of winning somebody other. There are no other values.</p><br/><p>Of course, that girl also has carnal desires. She\u2019s not sexually frigid. Even so, what then?</p><br/><p>Only a few man I like is allowed to do as they wish to my body. However, men I hate will not be forgiven if they do the same.</p><br/><p>That means,</p><br/><p>(In the end, I don\u2019t dislike Nicolas, is that it?)</p><br/><p>The reality is that people around her can\u2019t understand her.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, breakfast is ready. What would you like to eat? \u300d</p><br/><p>Sweets were suddenly brought fourth.</p><br/><p>Nicolas, preparing and carrying out breakfast for someone else, that is something nobody could possibly imagine.</p><br/><p>Because anybody who knew Nicolas would describe him has an arrogant egotistical, cold-blooded man with the mask of a saint.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I got it. Thank you\u300d</p><br/><p>When Hinata calls out casually, Nicolas nods his head with glee.</p><br/><p>And the two had breakfast.</p><br/><p>After a long time, the meal tasted delicious.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh yes. I had something to report to you, this is something a spy brought earlier. \u300d</p><br/><p>After finishing their meal and being relaxed, Nicolas talked to Hinata.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped if he want to gain her favor.</p><br/><p>Hinata, while combing her prized black hair left and right with her comb, stared at Nicolas.</p><br/><p>Picking up her circular glasses off the table and putting them on,</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s hear it.\u300d</p><br/><p>She asked briefly.</p><br/><p>Inside there is the beauty amongst beauties who held was the captain of the \u201cKnights guard division working directly under the pope\u201d.</p><br/><p>On her the usual calm, cold expression.</p><br/><p>The time to relax has come to an end.</p><br/><p>Nicolas began sharing his information.</p><br/><p>About the turbulence of the monsters within the Great Jura forest, and the monsters building a town.</p><br/><p>In addition, certain countries had already started trading with the monsters, that was what information were shared.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say? These monsters overturned the churches\u2019 religious belief that monsters are common enemies of mankind\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata mutters, to which Nicolas nods.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, what will you do? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFumu\u2026 That\u2019s right\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata is in deep though.</p><br/><p>Crushing them is easy. However, it is human nature to leave them alone if there are no problems.</p><br/><p>At the very least, as long as they are crushed before they make contact with humans, everything will be over.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe can only wait and see now. However, investigate the war potential of that town, and ensure this is a force we can crush! As the church, we cannot move unless there is a request from somewhere. Well, if nothing turns up we can simply force one out\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>TN Note: I\u2019ve already lost count how many fantasy novels have a human supremacy religion as their main antagonist\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus a conclusion was made.</p><br/><p>After hearing this remark, Nicolas nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet someone check it out!</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll mobilize the \u201cBlood Shadow\u201d of the church! \u300d</p><br/><p>The Blood Shadow is a fallen knight. With high combat prowess, he was a serial killer who murdered commoners.</p><br/><p>To god, the church and pope, there are a number of extremist who sworn allegiance.</p><br/><p>However, his abilities are top-notch, not someone the church could just simply disposed of.</p><br/><p>To Hinata who had a strong sense of disgust, the head is a funny existence. For the rationalist Hinata, god\u2019s blind acceptance was a symbol of stupidity.</p><br/><p>It was ironic considering Hinata\u2019s position as God\u2019s guardian of justice.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? Then, I\u2019m leaving it to you. It\u2019s best if you don\u2019t forget about the church\u2019s discipline. \u300d</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t the stage to take action.</p><br/><p>I leave the information gathering to you. Besides, there might be something to gain from this.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what she decided.</p><br/><p>As a result, the bloodthirsty mad hound was released.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

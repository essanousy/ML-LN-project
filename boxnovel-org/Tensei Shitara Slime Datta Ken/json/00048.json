Demon Lords\u2019 Invasion</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Milim Nava, Devil Grucius, and Devil Myulan observed the city Tempest from above while discussing their next move.</p><br/><p>Devil Grucius sighed mentally.</p><br/><p>After running without a moment of rest, they finally reached the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a terrible person Milim is! Any mistake while interacting with her could lead to a great disaster.\u201d He believed this fact with his entire being.</p><br/><p>So how should he converse with her from now\u2026?</p><br/><p>After staying with her for a while, he realized her complete lack of dishonesty. She is honest to an extreme.</p><br/><p>Of course, monsters are not good with lies, but they are not as restrained as the world tends to believe.</p><br/><p>While this doesn\u2019t apply to high ranking demons, most other monsters have no problem telling small lies.</p><br/><p>And if such a monster also happens to omit the the truth, they would have no problem conducting successful negotiations.</p><br/><p>However, Demon Lord Milim probably hasn\u2019t even heard the word \u201cnegotiation\u201d.</p><br/><p>She boldly declares her demands and rampages if they are rejected. That\u2019s the kind of image she gives off.</p><br/><p>Originally, Grucius had intended to observe the situation while hiding his identity as a high ranking devil.</p><br/><p>However, Milim would never even consider such secrecy. She unfortunately believes that if you are working, there is no need to hide anything.</p><br/><p>Now then, how should he proceed..?</p><br/><p>What could he say to continue working on his own\u2026?</p><br/><p>Devil Grucius was desperately thinking of a way out.</p><br/><p>Devil Myulan did not see any chance of this mission succeeding.</p><br/><p>Because suddenly, they were plagued by Demon Lord Milim.</p><br/><p>She is, after all, a demon lord who focused on strength, so her complete incompetency in espionage makes her a hindrance.</p><br/><p>However, she can\u2019t just say that to her face\u2026</p><br/><p>And besides, since Demon Lord Clayman failed to hold her back in the first place, he has no right to complain! She thought.</p><br/><p>Marionette Master, what a joke! Pushing this baggage of a demon lord on them and demanding secrecy! Impossible much?!</p><br/><p>He should have lived up to his nickname and manipulated her despite the fact that she is a fellow demon lord.</p><br/><p>Hiding her complaints in the dark corners of her mind, Myulan considered her next steps.</p><br/><p>She noticed the identically troubled look on Grucius face, and they locked eyes for a second.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it would be best for them to work together.</p><br/><p>At the very least, unless they had Milim work independently, she would definitely impact their mission.</p><br/><p>From what Demon Lord Clayman gathered, Demon Lord Karion intended to hire new subordinates.</p><br/><p>Seems like a number of oni served the mysterious masked monster.</p><br/><p>Karion probably hoped to win over the masked monster, or, in worst case scenario, try to lure away a few of its subordinates.</p><br/><p>Since Grucius would probably be moving with this objective in mind, Myulan decided to offer her support.</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t be able to learn their weaknesses if nothing happened, that is.</p><br/><p>Let Grucius do as he please and observe the situation. So she decided.</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t expect much from Milim, after all; it\u2019s like throwing a boulder into a pond.</p><br/><p>If the ripples are too great, the devils will also stand out.</p><br/><p>Thus, Myulan decided her plan. Now, to realize it\u2026</p><br/><p>Milim observed the city that spread beneath her.</p><br/><p>It is well made. The citizens all possess strong magical energy. All seem to be high ranking monsters.</p><br/><p>The term High ranking monsters refers to those that have developed intelligence, and depends not on their strength. She understood the extent of their cooperation with a single glance.</p><br/><p>Via her \u201cDragon Eye\u201d she could measure each of their abilities.</p><br/><p>How wonderful. Though it\u2019s hard to believe, but they are all named monsters.</p><br/><p>Who could have named them all?!</p><br/><p>She felt her amazement and astonishment overtake her.</p><br/><p>She certainly could not replicate such a troublesome feat. Especially considering the chance that the energy you bestow on someone may never return to you.</p><br/><p>Demon Lords like her tend to hate seeing their power disappear like that.</p><br/><p>This time she only showed up to kill some time.</p><br/><p>If she seriously made her move, not just Frey, but also Karion and Clayman would answer with great indignation.</p><br/><p>Fending off both of them at once would be troublesome, she figured; not intending to lose, of course\u2026</p><br/><p>But she was truly glad that she had come.</p><br/><p>The very fact that monsters built this city themselves was amusing.</p><br/><p>The castle that Milim resides in, in comparison, was built by humans. Who worship her as some deity.</p><br/><p>Her dominion\u2019s human villages were attacked by high magic beasts. And Milim, who just happened to be walking by, killed it; the humans seemed to have misunderstood her somehow.</p><br/><p>And thus, the land became hers.</p><br/><p>The other demon lords didn\u2019t complain, nor did Milim have any particular reason to complain.</p><br/><p>This time as well, she didn\u2019t come searching for new subordinates. Rather, she came to kill some time and to later see Clayman and Karion\u2019s upset faces.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the only reason for her journey.</p><br/><p>She had intended to let them have whoever once she finished teasing them, but\u2026</p><br/><p>For it to be like this!</p><br/><p>The monsters living here were of such high quality. Their abilities so great.</p><br/><p>And someone rules over them! How amusing!</p><br/><p>Her simple mind has by now completely forgotten about Clayman and Karion.</p><br/><p>She had found her target!</p><br/><p>Someone who\u2019s magic energy rivaled that of a demon lord!</p><br/><p>And thus, she made her move.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>After deciding to sell medium grade medicine as the city\u2019s specialty, we continued researching towards mass production.</p><br/><p>In order to produce some, I handed over some medicine that I had made myself.</p><br/><p>And then I got an idea, could the difference in purity be due to oxidization?</p><br/><p>That is, there is little between production through my skill and normal manufacturing.</p><br/><p>The only difference is that one occurs in an oxygen rich environment whereas the other is inside me.</p><br/><p>Bester listened seriously to my hypothesis.</p><br/><p>It seems that this world knows of chemical elements. Though, included among the different types of magic, in opposition to spirit magic, it is called chemical elements magic.</p><br/><p>I am personally not well versed in the concepts of magic, but Bester seemed to have understood my explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it affected by oxygen?\u201d He said he\u2019ll consider my hypothesis.</p><br/><p>In any case, I just mentioned whatever first came to mind, so it\u2019s not my fault if this is wrong.</p><br/><p>Success is built upon many failures. A mistake can also be considered progress.</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019m only in charge of HR, I passed on this job to him with and left.</p><br/><p>Kaijin is busy discussing something with Bester. They are so friendly right now that it is hard to believe their earlier animosity.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because their hobbies match. But this is for the best.</p><br/><p>I returned to the city using a magic circle.</p><br/><p>We set up the city\u2019s magic circle near the gates.</p><br/><p>At the vacant lot near the guardhouse, to be precise. So that in a one in a million chance that monsters do pass through the circle, we can quickly deal with them.</p><br/><p>Bester, however, insists that it is impossible.</p><br/><p>That is, since you need to recite an incantation to transfer, it is impossible for monsters to use it.</p><br/><p>So I\u2019m probably just worrying too much. Just using something I know nothing about, albeit hesitantly.</p><br/><p>I should learn magic soon\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, the moment I had intended to head over to Rigurdo\u2019s place to let him know about our success,</p><br/><p>My \u300eMagic Perception\u300fnoticed a large mass of magical energy flying in our direction.</p><br/><p>Dangerous! I made the split second decision and ran beyond the gate towards it.</p><br/><p>As expected, the lump changed direction mid-air and pursued me.</p><br/><p>Extremely quickly, too.</p><br/><p>Seems like we\u2019ll be meeting each other at the clearing outside the village. Good thing I didn\u2019t run into the village\u2013spared the buildings from some unnecessary damage.</p><br/><p>Steeling myself, I observed the opponent.</p><br/><p>The distance between us shortened greatly with every passing moment. That much could be understood with eyes alone.</p><br/><p>A beautiful girl. Blond hair tied into twin tails with a black Gothic dress covering her body.</p><br/><p>Her appearance was that of a lovely human girl. The air around her, however, screamed the exact opposite\u2026</p><br/><p>The lump of magical energy, or rather, the girl landed right in front of me.</p><br/><p>And frighteningly, she didn\u2019t cause a single ripple with her landing.</p><br/><p>Though she was flying at such terrifying speed she was able to erase it completely before landing.</p><br/><p>Could she perhaps manipulated the law of inertia itself?</p><br/><p>Now, however, was not the time to consider such things.</p><br/><p>\u300cPleased to meet you! I am the Demon Lord Milim Nava!</p><br/><p>I came to greet the strongest being in this city!\u300d</p><br/><p>The beautiful demon lord told me.</p><br/><p>A demon lord!</p><br/><p>Why the hell would one of those show up now\u2026</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t your subordinates or some four heavenly kings to show up before you!</p><br/><p>I somehow managed to hold back that retort; good job, me.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 how should I respond.</p><br/><p>I am currently in my slime form, and I am not revealing any of my aura.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at magic energy manipulation recently, so I can subconsciously prevent any leaks.</p><br/><p>In other words, I should appear as some lowly slime to the ignorant eyes.</p><br/><p>Whether I check with a clone or through \u300eMagic Perception\u300fI don\u2019t seem any different than a normal slime, that\u2019s how well I\u2019ve hid my aura.</p><br/><p>Even then\u2026 I wonder how she saw through me.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe pleasure is mine\u2026 I am the lord of the city, Rimuru.</p><br/><p>You seem to have seen through to my true strength, huh?\u300d</p><br/><p>Though perhaps the strongest one around here is actually Hakurou. Though I won\u2019t say that.</p><br/><p>While observing her, I asked that question.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufun! That kind of thing is simple for me.</p><br/><p>Using this eye, the dragon eye, I can see the target\u2019s magical energy even if they try to hide it!</p><br/><p>So no one can pretend to be weak before me!\u300d</p><br/><p>So eyes with analytical abilities?</p><br/><p>What an annoying opponent. Compared to my analysis, hers seems to be stronger.</p><br/><p>Her proficiency level is beyond question higher.</p><br/><p>This I can\u2019t win.</p><br/><p>If we fight, I might have to use all my skills and tactics just to create an opening.</p><br/><p>Her level is completely different from the pseudo-demon lord that Orc Disaster was.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat amazing eyes, you have. Now, what would be the purpose of your greetings?\u300d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s hear her intentions.</p><br/><p>Knowing your opponents goal is absolutely necessary, after all.</p><br/><p>\u300cMu? Purpose\u2026 you say? Just to greet you, though?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s hopeless.</p><br/><p>I had intended to eloquently convince her to go back, but stumbled at the first step.</p><br/><p>Just a greeting, she says! I\u2019m honestly at a loss here.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! Right, right, I remembered!</p><br/><p>You, how about calling yourself a demon lord, and becoming one?\u300d</p><br/><p>She suddenly added.</p><br/><p>The hell she saying\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Why would I want to do such a troublesome thing?\u300d</p><br/><p>She was the one to be surprised now.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, I mean, a demon lord! Sounds cool, right? You long for it, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Eh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d</p><br/><p>Seems like there\u2019s a fundamental difference in our thought process.</p><br/><p>We\u2019re just staring at each other faces without having our opinions reach the other. Well, a slime doesn\u2019t have a face, though.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, then, let me ask. What\u2019s so good about becoming a demon lord?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? That\u2019s\u2026 a bunch of strong people aim to fight you? It\u2019s fun, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNah\u2026 I have no need for that. Not interested.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEEHH? Then how do you enjoy your life?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn a bunch of ways\u2026 if I were to become a demon lord, are there other ways to have fun other than to fight?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNot really\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen isn\u2019t it really boring?\u300d</p><br/><p>The moment I said that, Milim appeared as if she were struck by lightning, and looked as if she took serious damage.</p><br/><p>She was bored, huh.</p><br/><p>My words were so accurate that she can\u2019t say anything in response.</p><br/><p>Any further conversation would prove meaningless.</p><br/><p>I should take advantage of her shock to take my leave.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, since we got that out of the way, could I ask you to leave!\u300d</p><br/><p>I handled that pretty well, I thought\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWait! Y-you! You\u2019re doing something more fun than being a demon lord, aren\u2019t you!</p><br/><p>No fair! No fair, no fair!!!</p><br/><p>I\u2019 m mad. Teach me! I won\u2019t forgive you if you don\u2019t!\u300d</p><br/><p>I should be the angry one!</p><br/><p>Just a brat! I had wanted to exclaim, but desperately held it back.</p><br/><p>The opponent is a demon lord, angering her would be bad.</p><br/><p>Rather, maybe if I treat her like a kid handling her will be so much easier.</p><br/><p>At times like this, just have to be straight with her.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s imagine her as a relative\u2019s kid.</p><br/><p>\u300cI got it, I got it. I\u2019ll teach you!</p><br/><p>But, I\u2019ve got a condition.</p><br/><p>From now on you\u2019ll call me Rimuru-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? Don\u2019t screw with me! The other way around!</p><br/><p>You should be calling me Milim-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, then I will call you Milim.</p><br/><p>And you will call me Rimuru. How about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMu mu mu\u2026 alright. Got it!</p><br/><p>I allow you to call me Milim.</p><br/><p>Be thankful! Only demon lords can call me that!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, is that so. Then let\u2019s drop formalities from now on!\u300d</p><br/><p>Some sparks flew between us during the conversation,</p><br/><p>But we seem to have settled on dropping formalities entirely between us.</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I\u2019ll guide you in, then. But don\u2019t go wandering on your own, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGot it! Rimuru!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGood good! Aren\u2019t you obedient. Also, don\u2019t go rampaging in the city without my permission, okay? If you can promise me that, I\u2019ll consider you my friend!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s easy! I promise, Rimuru!\u300d</p><br/><p>So far so good.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s easier than I thought. Just like a kid who\u2019d listen to anyone that would give them a candy.</p><br/><p>Monsters have to keep their promises, right?</p><br/><p>Should be fine then. Thinking that, I led Milim into the city.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Accompanied by a slime, Demon Lord Milim entered the city.</p><br/><p>Devil Grucius saw it happen using \u201cFar Sight\u201d.</p><br/><p>And bewildered by this fact,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, is Milim getting a head start on us?</p><br/><p>After taming some lowly slime\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo it seems. But this is for the best.</p><br/><p>We could never continue in secrecy with Milim around.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight. Let\u2019s just pretend we got rid of a bothersome person.\u300d</p><br/><p>They said nodding to each other.</p><br/><p>If they moved together, they couldn\u2019t imagine a scenario where their plan wouldn\u2019t go down the drain.</p><br/><p>And now that this happened, they can move freely.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, what will we do? How are we going to infiltrate?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>While the two were busy considering this, Grucius\u2019s \u201cFar Sight\u201d picked up a human squad approaching the city.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, a human squad! Are they here on monster extermination?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cProbably\u2026 but do they know that monsters built a city here?\u300d</p><br/><p>And looking at each other,</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s mix in with them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a good idea. We\u2019ll disguise ourselves as humans and infiltrate the city!\u300d</p><br/><p>They decided.</p><br/><p>As two high devils, they could easily transform into a human.</p><br/><p>And after some light preparations, they mixed in with the squad moving towards the city.</p><br/><p>The Monsters\u2019 City \u201cTempest\u201d,</p><br/><p>And thus, the two were able to meet the human named Youmu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

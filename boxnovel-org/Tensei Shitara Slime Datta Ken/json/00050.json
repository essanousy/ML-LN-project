How are you doing?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Hmm? Oh, came to buy some groceries. What\u2019s fresh today?</p><br/><p>Clerk: Just had some salmon and cod delivered. Oh, but I would recommend the saury, you always liked that one, didn\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Did I?</p><br/><p>Clerk: Though I guess that was before that. Oh sorry, you must not want to remember it.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Ah, no, it\u2019s no problem. That reminds me of a good joke, what did a father tomato say to the baby tomato whilst walking in a park?</p><br/><p>Clerk: What?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Ketchup.</p><br/><p>Clerk: Oh, haha! I guess you\u2019ve become more humorous now. You\u2019ve always been so serious; well, I guess such an incident would change anybody.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: \u2026 now that I think about it though. Did the father tomato threaten to turn the baby tomato into ketchup? Or was a baby tomato hit by a car and turned into ketchup? \u2026 hit by a car?</p><br/><p>Clerk: Did you say something? Another customer\u2019s calling me. I hope everything\u2019s going well. I\u2019ll stop by to visit later. We\u2019re friends, after all.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Life in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>050. Frontier Garrison</p><br/><p>The morning of the following day,</p><br/><p>Started with great tribulations.</p><br/><p>First thing in the morning I woke Milim up.</p><br/><p>Her expression grumpy, I had her change to look presentable.</p><br/><p>The new clothing she wore was the one she had requested yesterday, and it came out pretty well.</p><br/><p>The Gothic Dress was probably difficult to move in, hence the reason for her request.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy does a demon lord need to wake up so early in the morning!\u300d</p><br/><p>She was grumbling haughtily, but her mood improved by breakfast.</p><br/><p>Children really are simple.</p><br/><p>While she was eating, I was busy thinking.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t particularly mind becoming her supervisor, but I want to go to a human city. So, should I bring her along?</p><br/><p>I kind of have a bad feeling about doing that. No, let me rephrase\u2026 it\u2019s bound to lead to a disaster!</p><br/><p>To bring such a dangerous child to a place she\u2019s never been before\u2026 well, it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t, it\u2019s that I won\u2019t.</p><br/><p>But even so, leaving her here is bad for my heart.</p><br/><p>While Milim is visiting I should probably abstain from leaving for human cities.</p><br/><p>After we finished breakfast, I took Milim to the smithy.</p><br/><p>I took on my human form and wore a mask; since, as a slime, I wouldn\u2019t be able to try out a weapon.</p><br/><p>And once we reached it, I greeted Kurobee.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs the thing I asked for yesterday ready?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOo! This one, right? Should be good for Milim-sama\u2019s personal use!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, showing me the finished product.</p><br/><p>Yesterday, he had measured the size of Milim\u2019s hands after being asked to make her something.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s Dragon Knuckles!</p><br/><p>The point of such gloves would be to prevent injury when punching barehanded and to increase the force of the blow\u2026 normally. That\u2019s not why we gave her the gloves.</p><br/><p>No, our goal was the exact opposite. The light but dense \u201cDemon Steel\u201d is actually surrounded by a shock-absorbing material.</p><br/><p>Right! When she equips this, her blow will be reduced to only 10% of its norm!</p><br/><p>And we used Demon Steel in hopes of attaching a regenerative effect to them. The best part of it all will be the decrease in her destructive power.</p><br/><p>\u300cMilim, try this on!\u300d</p><br/><p>I pass the dragon knuckles to Milim, who, clearly excited, happily accepts them.</p><br/><p>And she quickly puts them on.</p><br/><p>She lightly throws some punches in the air.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh! This is great! My hands feel really light!\u300d</p><br/><p>Alright, seems to be working. If her hands feel light, I guess her power should have decreased a bit.</p><br/><p>And for myself, I took a newly developed sword.</p><br/><p>The last one I had broke myself, so I had them repair it.</p><br/><p>I had tried copying it myself, but even if it looked identical its performance was clearly different.</p><br/><p>Seems copying an item is impossible when the creator\u2019s skills are too high.</p><br/><p>Even if it looks the same, even if my appraising ability claims they are the same, there are nonetheless small differences.</p><br/><p>I draw the sword to check. Amazing. Kurobee\u2019s ability is truly something.</p><br/><p>I wish I could finally get a sword specialized for my use. Seems like they still need to work on that; I am not getting impatient, but I am looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>Nodding, I put the sword back into the scabbard.</p><br/><p>The moment Milim and I acquired our weapons, Rigurdo came running over.</p><br/><p>How well he runs\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, this is where You were! An unknown group has come!\u300d</p><br/><p>From what he told me, we have an armed squad near the city.</p><br/><p>Among them are the three adventurers.</p><br/><p>Somehow, the three idiots managed bringing an armed group over.</p><br/><p>Why are so many problems occurring now? Those idiots\u2026 so I thought, but,</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, let\u2019s go meet them.\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, and headed to the place where Rigurdo left them.</p><br/><p>And as if it was the most natural thing in the world, Milim followed.</p><br/><p>When I arrived I saw Rigur and the guards surrounding ten or so armed men.</p><br/><p>They are all dressed similarly. However, their equipment seems rather poor, and their ability likewise.</p><br/><p>Our equipment is worlds superior.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, among them are a man and a woman with clearly superior equipment.</p><br/><p>And not just their equipment\u2013their skills also seem pretty high.</p><br/><p>And of course, the three idiots. When they saw me,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh! Rimuru-danna, it\u2019s been a while!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHowdy! We came to hang out!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s been ages! Things happened\u2026 so there\u2019s more of us!\u300d</p><br/><p>They greeted me.</p><br/><p>Things happened, huh. Seems like they are the cause of this \u201cincident\u201d,</p><br/><p>\u300cYo. So, who might these people be?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAbout that\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>They explained the details.</p><br/><p>During his introduction, the man named Youmu kept looking at us while on guard.</p><br/><p>When the idiots finished,</p><br/><p>\u300cPleased to make your acquaintance! Farmas Kingdom, Count\u2019s Domain, Frontier Garrison Captain Youmu\u2019s the name.</p><br/><p>We heard that monsters built a city here so we came to check.</p><br/><p>I heard the chief of the city is a slime, could I meet it?\u300d</p><br/><p>He greeted us thus.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, please pardon the belated introduction. I am the head of this city and its representative.</p><br/><p>I am known as Rimuru Tempest.</p><br/><p>Though I currently appear thus, I am, in fact, a slime!\u300d</p><br/><p>I responded.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that how it was, pardon my rudeness.</p><br/><p>Cabal had mentioned that \u201cRimuru\u201d is the name of the head, but I was misled by you being called a slime, you see.</p><br/><p>Your human transformation is simply marvelous!\u300d</p><br/><p>Whether flattery or not I don\u2019t know, but he seems intent on praising me.</p><br/><p>I wonder if monsters capable of human transformation are rare? Not that it matters right now.</p><br/><p>\u300cBe that as it may. Are monsters capable of transforming into humans rare?</p><br/><p>Actually, forget that question; what would be your business today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, about that\u2026</p><br/><p>Our goal was to confirm the report. There has never been a case of monsters building a city before, you see\u2026</p><br/><p>Moreover, should that report prove true, there\u2019s the possibility that you will pose a threat to our country.</p><br/><p>Thus, considering that the city truly exists, we must confirm whether or not you could pose a threat to us.</p><br/><p>Could we possibly impose upon you our presence?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. However, if we were intending on becoming your enemies and were such a terrifying city, how could we let you stay here?\u300d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing my retort, the man named Youmu scratched his head.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, damn it. I\u2019ll just tell you the truth.</p><br/><p>Frankly, I didn\u2019t believe there was a city of monsters here. Now I know I was wrong.</p><br/><p>And, according to these three adventurers, you\u2019ve got really good living conditions around here.</p><br/><p>Please allow our stay and the stationing of troops here!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said in one breath.</p><br/><p>And to the three idiots,</p><br/><p>\u300cI apologize for doubting you!\u300d</p><br/><p>He deeply bowed his head in apology.</p><br/><p>I had planned to observe him for a while, but maybe it\u2019s alright to consider him an honest guy.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufuuun! Didn\u2019t we tell you!</p><br/><p>Well, as long as you understand! It doesn\u2019t do to always suspect people!\u300d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Ellen proudly responded.</p><br/><p>The other two were expressing their approval of her words or happiness at finally arriving.</p><br/><p>Well, he doesn\u2019t seem like a bad guy, but approving their presence is a different matter.</p><br/><p>\u300cRegarding stationing your troops here: for what purpose? \u300d</p><br/><p>Youmu faced me and began explaining their situation.</p><br/><p>Their unit was established by Farmas Kingdom\u2019s Count to protect the villages against monsters; they are composed of thirty members in three divisions.</p><br/><p>From where we stood, they could easily access the highway and nearby villages.</p><br/><p>\u300cMoreover, if we lay roads to the highway, we\u2019d be saving time and establishing a trade route.</p><br/><p>Of course, we will offer our labor towards that end!\u300d</p><br/><p>He ended with a proposal.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s possible to get here on horseback, the same is not true for carriages.</p><br/><p>We hadn\u2019t cleared any trees in the direction of the highway.</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t want to stand out at the time; but that was before the earlier orc incident.</p><br/><p>Now that the forest has begun to calm down we should think about opening a trade route.</p><br/><p>So perhaps it might be a good idea to accept his proposal.</p><br/><p>Since it\u2019s bad taste to continue such discussion on our feet, I guided everyone to the cafeteria.</p><br/><p>Though our menu selection is still limited, it is nonetheless delicious.</p><br/><p>Since we unfortunately are low on salt, pepper, and other seasoning, we can\u2019t offer any subtle spicing.</p><br/><p>Or so I\u2019d say if not for Shuna\u2019s godly cooking skills. That is, hers and that of her apprentice chefs Goblinas.</p><br/><p>The number of Goblinas has been steadily increasing.</p><br/><p>The security and order of the city is maintained by men while women take care of household matters and cooking.</p><br/><p>Since they have their individual talents, they spread themselves among Cooking, Cleaning, Education, Sewing, Assistance, and other professions.</p><br/><p>Their efficiency can be primarily attributed to Rigurdo\u2019s skill at governing.</p><br/><p>After switching to the cafeteria we continued our discussion.</p><br/><p>Amusingly, Milim sat next to me.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s kind of cute how carefully she handles her dragon knuckles.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Rimuru-danna, whose daughter would she be?\u300d</p><br/><p>Cabal went and asked.</p><br/><p>Milim reacted to being called a daughter, but exercised self-restraint. Good word choice, Cabal.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t forget that this cafeteria has the bomb named Milim.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, a guest. A really important person, so treat her with utmost respect, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>I warned them ahead of time.</p><br/><p>If they ignore my warning, they\u2019ll have only themselves to blame. Not my problem then.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m Milim. Please to meet you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Though Milim so simply introduced herself, let\u2019s not forget she is a cruel demon lord.</p><br/><p>She is so adorable, however, that she certainly deceived them all\u2026</p><br/><p>But a man and a woman, whose equipment was much better than the rest, had a worried expression on their faces.</p><br/><p>Actually, rather than expression, it\u2019s the air around them\u2013it changed slightly.</p><br/><p>They looked at Milim with complete disbelief.</p><br/><p>Did they find her out? No, there\u2019s no way that would be true. So I thought until I looked closer at the two\u2026</p><br/><p>Huh? Why are two devils disguising themselves as humans among them? Yes, the two of them are devils.</p><br/><p>A simple human transformation could not fool my \u300eMagic Perception\u300f.</p><br/><p>From what Youmu said, they joined them half way. Infiltration, is that it?</p><br/><p>(Hey, two devils infiltrated the city, be on your guard!)</p><br/><p>I announced using \u300eThought Transmission\u300f.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s fine as long as they don\u2019t do anything funny.</p><br/><p>(Rimuru-sama, considering that they showed up at the same time as Demon Lord Milim, could they be connected somehow?)</p><br/><p>(I am of the same opinion, Rimuru-sama. A ploy to make us lower our guard?)</p><br/><p>(Nooooope! I wouldn\u2019t do something that annoying!!!)</p><br/><p>Milim made her way into my\u300eThought Transmission\u300fnetwork. She seems to have figured out our frequency and forced her way in.</p><br/><p>What an absurd thing to do.</p><br/><p>Even if I make it sound so simple, make no mistake\u2013it requires an absurdly high level of skill</p><br/><p>(Hey you, did you just break into our network?!)</p><br/><p>(Fufun! That kind of thing is easy for me!</p><br/><p>But let bygones be bygones. Those two have no relation to me!!)</p><br/><p>(But you know them?)</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Eh? I.. I don\u2019t?)</p><br/><p>(\u2026)</p><br/><p>(\u2026)</p><br/><p>(Well, whatever. Just stay on your guard, everyone!)</p><br/><p>Though they aren\u2019t related, they are acquainted it seems.</p><br/><p>No need to force her to say it if she doesn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s enough to know what we need to stay vigilant against.</p><br/><p>While I was conversing thus, everyone was busy with self-introductions.</p><br/><p>And that seems to have ended a second ago.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow that everyone introduced themselves, let\u2019s get to the heart of the matter!\u300d</p><br/><p>The main question was whether to allow them to establish a base here; but, before that, they need to clarify something.</p><br/><p>\u300cI should be considering this a personal request of Youmu-san, shouldn\u2019t I?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, that would be accurate. In fact, the country will not know of this.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. Though there\u2019s a bunch of reasons, frankly, I hate the feudal lord.</p><br/><p>Our employer, Count Nidole Maidam, is no decent man.</p><br/><p>The kind of guy who prioritizes personal benefit over that of the people.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s greedy, and rough with his men.</p><br/><p>Though he levies a heavy tax on the people in return for protection, the garrison sees none of it.</p><br/><p>The worst kind of man.</p><br/><p>Well, as someone who badmouths his employer, I am no decent man either.</p><br/><p>In any case, as a result, we are severely understaffed.</p><br/><p>If we set up a base here we could easily access the surrounding villages.</p><br/><p>But, if we report this, he\u2019s bound to meddle with your city.</p><br/><p>The clothing you produce is your specialty, right? It\u2019s worlds better than what his city produces, you know?</p><br/><p>Well, this is considered neutral zone, so I can\u2019t imagine him moving independently, but\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>A greedy feudal lord. A common setting.</p><br/><p>Yes, I wouldn\u2019t want to have to deal with such a gloomy character.</p><br/><p>But considering how frankly Youmu explains all this, he must be serious.</p><br/><p>He seriously wants to set up a base here. To earn my trust, he\u2019s speaking only the truth.</p><br/><p>Our conversation continued.</p><br/><p>After Rigurdo and the oni voiced their opinions, we passed our decision.</p><br/><p>We decided to let them use a single empty house.</p><br/><p>Of course, should they cause problems, we will immediately evict them. Moreover, we\u2019ll be collecting money for their meals.</p><br/><p>That we decided to include after hearing Kaijin\u2019s opinion.</p><br/><p>A single night for a single person costs three silver coins. The average rate at a city for a sunny room is between 5~8 coins.</p><br/><p>A single room at an inn could be as low as 3 coins. That includes a single simple meal.</p><br/><p>Staying without a meal will cost between 1~2 coins.</p><br/><p>The imperial capital would easily be five times as expensive.</p><br/><p>By the way, a hundred silver coins is equal to a single gold one. I still have the twenty gold pieces I got from Kaidou.</p><br/><p>By our standards, a single silver coin equals a thousand yen, and a single gold coin is a hundred thousand yen.</p><br/><p>Though monetary value also depends on item costs and such; well, in any case, Kaidou seems to have spent a lot.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s only expected considering the value of the medicine, however.</p><br/><p>Well, it should be enough to kick-start our economy.</p><br/><p>\u300cThree coins is too high, please lower it slightly!\u300d</p><br/><p>Youmu began negotiating the cost.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph! Listen up, the room includes three meals a day, and a bath!</p><br/><p>If you have a problem, we\u2019ll lend you a storage house instead, how about it?</p><br/><p>There we\u2019ll charge a single silver coin, but no meals!\u300d</p><br/><p>Youmu pondered Kaijin\u2019s words, but gave up in the end.</p><br/><p>He probably remembered the meal he just ate.</p><br/><p>And thus, we lent out lodging to Farmas Kingdom\u2019s Count\u2019s Domain Garrison Guard led by Youmu.</p><br/><p>We also let them use the first floor of the guard house as their office.</p><br/><p>Youmu\u2019s group brought in their equipment there.</p><br/><p>Seems like they use a Magic Communicator type of thing that allows them to contact individual units.</p><br/><p>However, unfortunately, they can only speak for three minutes every hour. The magic cost is simply so high that so they can\u2019t supply enough.</p><br/><p>Thus it\u2019s mostly used to rely unit orders or for emergency situations.</p><br/><p>An expensive piece of equipment, they seem to only have six of those.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s also due to how cheap their employer is.</p><br/><p>Including the two \u201cnewcomers\u201d, the human squad is composed of 32 people.</p><br/><p>From where they are located \u2013 well, here as of now \u2013 they can reach every village within a day. They\u2019ve gotten much more efficient as a result, it seems.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve also gotten used to life here.</p><br/><p>After Youmu contacted them via the magic communicator, they all assembled here. A merry bunch they are.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cPlease take care of us from now on!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>They all shouted.</p><br/><p>\u300cOur pleasure! However, should you cause any trouble, I can\u2019t guarantee your lives. So be careful, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>I threw in a light threat in there.</p><br/><p>Though we\u2019re clearly monsters, they were on their guard only for the first few minutes.</p><br/><p>But let\u2019s not allow them to let their guard down so much that they cause a ruckus here.</p><br/><p>Though they seem like a bunch of good guys, so maybe I\u2019m worrying too much.</p><br/><p>As planned, I then introduced Youmu to Rigur.</p><br/><p>After we explained how far our defense network spans, the frontier garrison decided to fill in the holes between us and the villages.</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s a lot of room to spare, a single unit can work on building a road.</p><br/><p>And the free high orc construction division will be sent to help them with that.</p><br/><p>Thus, albeit very unexpectedly, Youmu\u2019s group became familiar with our city.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

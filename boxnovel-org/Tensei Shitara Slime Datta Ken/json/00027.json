Rimuru could perhaps be both, is what I thought. Considering Rimuru\u2019s current human-body state, I am always troubled about what pronoun I should use.</p><br/><p>Clown: Oh, that makes sense\u2026 not! Just admit it\u2013you like that reading better!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Busted, huh?</p><br/><p>Clown: I always know what you\u2019re thinking!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Oh? Then what joke am I thinking of right now?</p><br/><p>Clown: \u2026 \u201d \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and \u2018I apologize\u2019 mean the same thing\u2026 except when you\u2019re at a funeral\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Yup!</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Forest Disturbance Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 27 \u2013 The Ogre Tribe</p><br/><p>All monsters within the cave now run away at the mere sight of me.</p><br/><p>Probably the result of my aura.</p><br/><p>Pleased, I left the cave.</p><br/><p>So I planned, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cGu, who is it! Pursuers?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYoung master! We\u2019ll only slow you down! Please escape with the princess!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWicked demon! Don\u2019t try to deceive our eyes!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>And other similar grand statements I could hear from a group at the entrance of the cave.</p><br/><p>Height surpassing two meters, a group of large monsters looking like a ragtag militia. Their bodies a lump of muscles, the ogres.</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t these the self-proclaimed rulers of the forest? They look exactly as Rigurdo has described.</p><br/><p>So, what are they afraid of, some demon? What\u2019s with that? Scary!</p><br/><p>A bit bewildered, I plan my escape.</p><br/><p>I check behind me, but don\u2019t feel any presence. No heat signatures either.</p><br/><p>So the ogres can see it but I can\u2019t! This might be bad\u2026</p><br/><p>Just when I thought I had gained new abilities\u2026 I guess I am still far from true strength.</p><br/><p>\u300cKu, a demon? What kind? My bad, but I don\u2019t see it\u2026 where is it now?\u300d</p><br/><p>While on my guard, I begin to make retreat to ogre\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>But they still haven\u2019t responded to my question.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they are keeping distance from me.</p><br/><p>What? Are they planning on using me as a bait?</p><br/><p>The moment I thought so,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you saying? The wicked demon is none other than you, slime! You have not fooled our eyes!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>One of the ogres called out.</p><br/><p>Wha\u2026 what?</p><br/><p>To call such an adorable slime a wicked demon? That\u2019s not a nice thing to say!</p><br/><p>\u300cOi. Oi! Wait a second. I am a the wicked demon?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you trying to play dumb? That aura unbefitting of a slime! Did you think you\u2019d fool someone?!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmm? Oh\u2026 I was enjoying freaking out the cave\u2019s monsters too much and kept it open, huh.</p><br/><p>So I quickly pull back the aura. And,</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t have anything like that! You must\u2019ve imagined it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300c\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Of course, I couldn\u2019t fool them.</p><br/><p>But, after insisting that it was just a misunderstanding for a while, I somehow managed to have them lower their guard.</p><br/><p>Oh, boy\u2026</p><br/><p>In the first place, why are they even here?</p><br/><p>When I so asked, they told me that they had escaped here.</p><br/><p>Looking closely, there are many injured, with some gravely so.</p><br/><p>A normal monster would have died by now.</p><br/><p>The only reason they are still standing is surely due to the extremely high vitality of the ogre race.</p><br/><p>Still, I proceed to spit out some restorative medicine and treat their wounds.</p><br/><p>With their high vitality, even the diluted medicine quickly restores them to perfect health.</p><br/><p>While appearing surprised for some reason, they thank me.</p><br/><p>Now, although their wounds are healed, they are nonetheless clearly exhausted. So I decided to have them rest at my village.</p><br/><p>After all, I need to find out what had enough power to so decimate the ogres.</p><br/><p>They are a B rank monsters; but, from training, they can raise that to B+ or even A-.</p><br/><p>The rulers of the forest. The strongest beings around, or so I heard.</p><br/><p>In any case, I\u2019ll guide them to the village.</p><br/><p>Deciding to carry them over there, I summoned Ranga.</p><br/><p>When called, he appears from within my shadow. That is, I finally succeeded at summoning him.</p><br/><p>My pride simply didn\u2019t allow the fact that Gobuta succeeded where I couldn\u2019t. Thus, I practiced.</p><br/><p>And good thing I had done so\u2013considering the current situation.</p><br/><p>There were six ogres.</p><br/><p>Mimicking the black wolf, I carried three and left the remaining three to Ranga; thus we returned to the village.</p><br/><p>By foot it would have taken more than a day, but at our pace we managed it in under an hour.</p><br/><p>As expected of ogres! Unlike the dwarfs who fainted, they were merely impressed with the speed.</p><br/><p>Thus, we escorted the ogres to our village, where I invited them to my tent.</p><br/><p>Well, in place of the tent stood a log cabin when I arrived.</p><br/><p>Looking just like the blueprint I had suggested.</p><br/><p>Seems like while I was away practicing my skills, they quickly set it up.</p><br/><p>While thanking the dwarfs and goblins, I enter it.</p><br/><p>Looks just like I had imagined. Amazing.</p><br/><p>The blueprint I made by drawing on a plank with some charcoal, and, along with measurements, I passed it all to Mildo.</p><br/><p>After looking it over, \u201cGot it!\u201d he exclaimed. By the results. seems like my handwriting effectively communicated the design.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the room was furnished just as I had previously requested.</p><br/><p>As for the ogres, I show them to the reception room.</p><br/><p>And, asking them to wait inside, I head over to the dwarfs.</p><br/><p>To pick up the clothing I had requested from Garm, of course.</p><br/><p>Assuming my child version, I tried the clothing on.</p><br/><p>Steelthread underwear, and fang wolf outerwear.</p><br/><p>The materials used, of course, came from the previous pack leader. But, for some reason, the fur had turned black.</p><br/><p>Putting on pants and overcoat, I felt like I dressed to impress.</p><br/><p>As an extra bonus, it seems that the fur had quite some magical energy stored in it.</p><br/><p>\u300cDanna, this seems to have tremendous defense power. It ain\u2019t just some normal fur!\u300d</p><br/><p>Satisfied, Garm gave his approval.</p><br/><p>The final item was not armor, but a piece of clothing. Which is fine. I\u2019d fine without it, but I guess having it is better.</p><br/><p>So I thought, until I heard about,</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, by the way, this attire just happened to have become a magic item. It will always perfectly fit the one who wears it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Such wonderful news! In other words, even if I turn into my adult version, the clothing won\u2019t rip!</p><br/><p>Well done, Garm-kun.</p><br/><p>Chances are, the fur, that had been constantly floating inside my magical energy (stomach), was thus strengthened. So, if I come across any good ingredients, I should remember to allow them to mature inside.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s make a mental note about that.</p><br/><p>Now then, I shouldn\u2019t make them wait too long.</p><br/><p>Having found a fitting spot, I asked Haruna to prepare tea for seven people, and returned to the ogres.</p><br/><p>The ogres patiently waited. Perhaps finding things unusual, they were looking around the room.</p><br/><p>Sadly, as the building had just recently been finished, it lacks any decoration.</p><br/><p>Haruna brought in tea, and immediately left.</p><br/><p>I guess it\u2019s now time to try out my human sense of taste.</p><br/><p>I take a sip of the tea. Delicious.</p><br/><p>To someone who never made a fuss about taste or anything, this world\u2019s palette has already been able to impress me.</p><br/><p>It tastes like matcha\u2013a bit bitter. I also feels its warmth. Not the effect of warmth, but just warmth itself.</p><br/><p>A bizarre feeling.</p><br/><p>The ogres too seem to enjoy the tea.</p><br/><p>And after we had all calmed down, we began the discussion.</p><br/><p>Half way through, I called for Rigurdo. And, I also had the remaining four clan chiefs also attend.</p><br/><p>Kaijin also just started his break, and came over. Perfect.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo and Ririna immediately came over.</p><br/><p>The rest are apparently very busy, so we decided to continue the conversation with the five of us.</p><br/><p>Why did I call for them?</p><br/><p>Because of the gravity of the situation.</p><br/><p>If I had to summarize the ogre\u2019s story, it would be simple: a war. And the ogres were defeated.</p><br/><p>Just that.</p><br/><p>At the same time as we fought the Flame Giant Ifrit, the ogres were caught up in their own war.</p><br/><p>Who could have taken on the rulers of the forest? And to win, at that\u2026</p><br/><p>The goblin chiefs were just as shocked.</p><br/><p>In a instant, their expressions tightened.</p><br/><p>The enemy was?</p><br/><p>\u300cThey suddenly attacked our village. With overwhelming strength\u2026! Those bastards\u2026 Orcs!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Unlike humans, monsters don\u2019t have any rules stipulating a declaration of war.</p><br/><p>But, although they can\u2019t badmouthed for the surprise attack, the fact that the orcs even attacked the ogres in the first place is strange.</p><br/><p>Orcs rank between C~D. Stronger than your average goblin, but pose no danger to veteran adventurers.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 these weaklings attacked the strongest, and even managed to win\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus, I asked for details.</p><br/><p>The ogre village, though perhaps it was too small to call it that, only housed 300 ogres.</p><br/><p>300 B rank monsters.</p><br/><p>That is the size of a country\u2019s knights order. If you are planning on subjugating such a village with rank B- knights, you\u2019d need about 3,000 of them.</p><br/><p>And the orcs possessing that much might? We all have expressions of disbelief.</p><br/><p>Considering that nearly every villager was slaughtered.</p><br/><p>The village chief and a small group apparently opened up a path for their young master and the princess to escape.</p><br/><p>With a pained voice, one ogre said,</p><br/><p>\u300cHad I had more power\u2026!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He must be their young master.</p><br/><p>The last scene they had seen was that of their chief falling to the orcs.</p><br/><p>Also, a giant orc was releasing some strange aura.</p><br/><p>There were there others like him.</p><br/><p>While the elite warriors of the village approached those four, the remaining orcs invaded the village.</p><br/><p>They numbered around a ten thousand. Of course, he did not count each one, but rather felt that there were at least that many.</p><br/><p>But regardless of method, there was an absurd number of orcs.</p><br/><p>And each one, like the humans, was fully armored in plate mail.</p><br/><p>Should that be true, then this was certainly not planned by orcs alone.</p><br/><p>Perhaps some country is using the orcs\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm, perhaps, they have become pawns of the \u201cDemon Lord\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaijin muttered.</p><br/><p>Does that possibility exist\u2026?</p><br/><p>I thought that the Demon Lord avoids the forest on priniciple.</p><br/><p>Beyond the forest spreads the demon\u2019s continent.</p><br/><p>With fertile land, production is undertaken by the enslaved masses and golems.</p><br/><p>Thus, the demon\u2019s country does not starve, and cares little for humans.</p><br/><p>And for that reason, a demon lord desiring conquest would be most likely to attack the humans.</p><br/><p>However, there could surely be a demon lord who, out of boredom, decides to start a war.</p><br/><p>The disappearance of the Jura Forest\u2019s guardian \u2013 Veldora \u2013 also meant that this particular type of demon lord would no longer be deterred.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>In that case, I probably have to put more thought into the defense of the forest.</p><br/><p>Now, what happens next\u2026?</p><br/><p>I asked for everyone\u2019s opinion.</p><br/><p>\u300cI believe the orcs intend to capture our lands!\u300d</p><br/><p>Rigurdo answers on everyone\u2019s behalf.</p><br/><p>They look at me, waiting for my opinion.</p><br/><p>Fight, run, or join them?</p><br/><p>The ogres, after all, would immediately become prisoners depending on my decision.</p><br/><p>Quickly, the tension rises.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, how about we request some more tea!\u300d</p><br/><p>Having said that, I called for a second serving.</p><br/><p>As everyone sips their tea, their expressions loosen.</p><br/><p>Now, then.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you planning on doing?\u300d</p><br/><p>I ask the ogres.</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t it obvious. Look for a chance, and charge right in!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. I have to take revenge for my master!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMe too! While I am yet powerless, I can\u2019t let those pigs live!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cWe shall follow our young master and princess!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Huh. They know they\u2019re going to their deaths, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys. Not interested in becoming my subordinates?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yeah. Even if they do, the goblins won\u2019t be enough to sway the course of battle.</p><br/><p>We need to increase our fighting strength for when the orcs arive.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you guys support me, I think I can fulfill your wishes?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you saying?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSimple. I\u2019ll help you guys. Well, I\u2019ll be fighting them anyways eventually.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026 the goblins will help us fight, and we\u2019ll be used to protect this place\u2026 right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cExactly. By the way, it\u2019s fine if the agreement lasts until we defeat the orcs! Afterwards, I don\u2019t mind if you request your freedom.</p><br/><p>You can stay with the goblins and create a country! Or, you can set off on your own! How about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>The ogre called \u201cyoung master\u201d stopped to think upon hearing my offer.</p><br/><p>As expected of a B rank. This \u201cyoung master\u201d clearly has the abilities of a B+. I can see intelligence in his eyes.</p><br/><p>He slowly closed his eyes, and then opened them wide. And,</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood! We shall become your subordinates!\u300d</p><br/><p>To raise their chances of victory if even a bit, they decided to serve me.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m glad, to say the least.</p><br/><p>Perhaps I can save these guys too.</p><br/><p>I hadn\u2019t known at the time, but the ogres often served as mercenaries.</p><br/><p>And, the vanguard army that demon lord had sent out, just happened to be of the same occupation.</p><br/><p>They easily accepted my offer.</p><br/><p>When I had heard it then, I accepted them as friends without question.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright! Now then, let\u2019s name you guys!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? What are\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>The usual naming.</p><br/><p>While the ogres are bewildered by the turn of events, I don\u2019t mind at all.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll quickly give them some names!</p><br/><p>Today, I feel particularly creative.</p><br/><p>I looked at the color of their aura.</p><br/><p>Young master will be \u201cBenimaru\u201d.</p><br/><p>Princess will be \u201cShuna\u201d.</p><br/><p>Their guard as well, Kurobee, Hakurou, Souei, Shion.</p><br/><p>So I called them.</p><br/><p>And then I entered a state of low activity\u2026</p><br/><p>Hey, for that to happen from just six of them\u2026 what\u2019s with that?</p><br/><p>When I awoke (well, I was awake, but\u2026) the following day, I got my answer.</p><br/><p>With hair burning like a crimson flame, Benimaru.</p><br/><p>Although he used to be big and bulky, his height decreased to 180 cm, and his body tightened.</p><br/><p>However, his magical energy changed, enough to mistake him for a different being\u2026</p><br/><p>Eh? They evolved that much?</p><br/><p>That, of course, was my intention.</p><br/><p>Clearly, they surpassed A rank. Truly, Onibito. (TL note: Ogre-men sounds weird)</p><br/><p>Two black horns protrude from below the hair. Glowing more brilliantly than obsidian.</p><br/><p>Though I bet he\u2019d find it unpleasant if I called him a beauty.</p><br/><p>Next.</p><br/><p>Shuna and Shion are women. If the princess were a guy, I\u2019d be complaining.</p><br/><p>Ogre women were surprisingly beautiful, but the evolution made them gorgeous.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with this? Where did these idols come from?</p><br/><p>No, no, they aren\u2019t that good!</p><br/><p>From within her long, wavy, pink hair, two white horns could be seen. White skin and pink lips.</p><br/><p>What a beautiful girl!!! Her height is about 155 cm.</p><br/><p>Crimson eyes, with a gaze filled with passion, stare at me.</p><br/><p>The other, Shion.</p><br/><p>Purple, dark, straight hair, with a single purple horn. White skin, and red lips.</p><br/><p>Purple eyes, as if looking into my soul. A height of 170 cm\u2026</p><br/><p>Licking her lips as models sometimes do, a true beauty.</p><br/><p>I want her as my secretary.</p><br/><p>So I thought from the bottom of my heart.</p><br/><p>Kurobee is in his prime. A dandy uncle.</p><br/><p>Hakurou is a middle-aged man. However, you can\u2019t underestimate him for it.</p><br/><p>Souei is the same age as Benimaru.</p><br/><p>Darker skin, and dark blue hair. A beautiful man with a different air around him; 190 cm tall.</p><br/><p>Blue eyes, that suit him well.</p><br/><p>And all surpass A rank!</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll say it again. They all surpass A rank!!!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I had to use that much magical energy!</p><br/><p>If you asked me, I\u2019d tell you that all the strongest ogres had fled here\u2026</p><br/><p>And they probably already had names.</p><br/><p>But really, if they betray us\u2026 that ain\u2019t going to be anything to laugh about!</p><br/><p>And, as if ridiculing my worries,</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cRimuru-sama! We humbly wish for You to listen to our request! If You are so kindly disposed, please accept our loyalty!!!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>And, they simultaneously bowed before me!</p><br/><p>A reason to refuse\u2026? I have none.</p><br/><p>Thus, I obtained new comrades!</p><br/><p>\u2026 the fact that I slightly feared their strength, we\u2019ll keep a secret!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

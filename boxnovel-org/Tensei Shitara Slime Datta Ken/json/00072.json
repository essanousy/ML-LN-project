You have a split personality disorder.</p><br/><p>Clown: You have a split personality disorder.</p><br/><p>Oda: Not me! You!.. Alright, let\u2019s try this one more time\u2026 \u201cI have a split personality disorder\u201d</p><br/><p>Clown: You have a split personality disorder.</p><br/><p>Oda: Are you messing with me on purpose?</p><br/><p>Clown: Yes.</p><br/><p>Oda: \u2026 Okay, let\u2019s try this differently. Who is Pierrot?</p><br/><p>Clown: My friend!</p><br/><p>Oda: No. She\u2019s a personality you have created to fill in the void of losing your twin sister Aiko.</p><br/><p>Clown: Aiko?</p><br/><p>Oda: Yes. She committed suicide three years ago.</p><br/><p>Kanzaki Yuuko: That was no suicide!!! Murdered!!! Murdered!!! Murdered!!!</p><br/><p>Oda: I guess I\u2019ll be increasing the dosage\u2026</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Note: for consistency I will be writing Rafael as Raphael, and High Demon as Greater Demon from now on. No extra meaning in either case.</p><br/><p>Birth of a Demon Lord</p><br/><p>072. Upon Awakening</p><br/><p>A new morning has come!</p><br/><p>That nostalgic phrase appeared in my mind.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I last felt the feeling of awakening.</p><br/><p>I mean, since I don\u2019t need to sleep in this world, this is this body\u2019s first experience at sleeping.</p><br/><p>I behold the scene before me, and see busy preparations occurring in every corner of the city.</p><br/><p>Even a quick feel reveals pulsating strength emanating from their bodies.</p><br/><p>That, I believe, is the effect of my evolution.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! Rimuru-sama, you have awakened!\u300d</p><br/><p>I hear a nostalgic voice.</p><br/><p>And from behind me, I feel a nostalgic aura.</p><br/><p>I was hugged from behind by two warm, soft hills.</p><br/><p>Evolution hasn\u2019t changed my slime form very much.</p><br/><p>If anything, my color became silver with streaks of gold.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 I\u2019m that, right? Gold Slime or something?</p><br/><p>The one that can move at the speed of light.</p><br/><p>Though that\u2019s probably impossible, I do feel a kind of \u201chighest type of slime around\u201d aura about me.</p><br/><p>This me was sitting on top of Shion\u2019s lap, her cheek rubbing against mine.</p><br/><p>Yup. It feels great.</p><br/><p>But, thank goodness! As planned, she seems to have resurrected.</p><br/><p>And I have become a demon lord.</p><br/><p>Moreover, not just Shion, but every person felled by the Blood Shadows has successfully come back to life.</p><br/><p>I had worried whether the success rate was affected by distance from me, so I\u2019m glad everyone was able to resurrect.</p><br/><p>Well, I guess even\u300eGreat Sage\u300fmakes mistakes. Though I don\u2019t mind if they make me happy.</p><br/><p>While rejoicing at her rebirth, I also dutifully enjoyed the feel of her breasts.</p><br/><p>A truly heavenly moment it was.</p><br/><p>But as if intending to ruin this beautiful moment,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Rimuru-sama, you have awakened?</p><br/><p>But I must confirm whether you are fully yourself, or else we couldn\u2019t rest easy.</p><br/><p>You should remember our code, don\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>Now then, let me confirm.\u300eHow\u2019s Shion\u2019s cooking?\u300fhow will you respond!\u300d</p><br/><p>With an evil smile, Benimaru asks me.</p><br/><p>Of course I remember,\u300eIt\u2019s horrible\u300fright? Seriously, what a worrywart.</p><br/><p>The moment I thought to respond, I noticed the peril I was in.</p><br/><p>Hmm? Aren\u2019t I being held by Shion right now\u2026?</p><br/><p>If I say\u300eIt\u2019s horrible\u300f\u2026 what will happen I wonder\u2026</p><br/><p>A terrifying image filled my mind.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t she squash me out of anger?</p><br/><p>Damn it! He got me!!! A classic Hiroaki styled trap.</p><br/><p>What should I say? What would be a good response?</p><br/><p>Right! Great Sage will certainly come up with a good answer.</p><br/><p>I thought, and tried activating\u300eGreat Sage\u300fbut it did not respond.</p><br/><p>What\u2026 does this mean\u2026? Hey, Great Sage!!!</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. Unique Skill\u300eGreat Sage\u300fhas evolved into Ultimate Skill\u300eRaphael\u300f</p><br/><p>As a result, it has been erased and cannot be used.\u226b</p><br/><p>Oh\u2026 so even my skills evolved.</p><br/><p>But, Raphael, huh? Named after an angel; seems pretty amazing.</p><br/><p>That aside, what\u2019s important is escaping this perilious situation.</p><br/><p>Alright, Raphael, what\u2019s the best phrase to deceive Shion with?</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. After some calculations, an adequate phrase was not found\u226b</p><br/><p>Useless~!!!</p><br/><p>Great Sage was no good with these situations and Raphael is just as bad.</p><br/><p>Honestly, so did the evolution affect the name without changing any parameters!</p><br/><p>Of course, this exchange happened within a single second.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? What about my cooking?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Oh, it\u2019s been so long that Rimuru-sama wants a taste, right?</p><br/><p>That way you\u2019ll be able to show the results of your efforts.</p><br/><p>Surely, he\u2019ll happily accept the meal?</p><br/><p>And just a side note, I don\u2019t need any!\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru said such a wicked thing.</p><br/><p>And to try to leave himself out of it\u2026 this bastard!</p><br/><p>You know\u2026 just when I woke up in a good mood, to be sentenced to eternal sleep is\u2026!</p><br/><p>Shion happily accepted his proposal, and hastily ran off screaming \u201cI have received his favor!\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt an unbelievable fear overtake me.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, what are you doing! No way I could respond\u300eIt\u2019s horrible\u300fyou know!</p><br/><p>You purposefully trapped me, didn\u2019t you, Benimaru!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Well, shouldn\u2019t you have a taste after so long? Thanks to the constant taste testing that I do, I\u2019ve recently acquired\u300ePoison Resistance\u300f\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru said with a distant gaze.</p><br/><p>A\u2026 are you kidding me.\u300ePoison Resistance\u300f\u2026</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you just equate her cooking to poison?!</p><br/><p>What a tragedy. To find myself in it right after awakening.</p><br/><p>Just after enduring one peril, to find myself in another?</p><br/><p>The revived have come to greet me.</p><br/><p>Though their aura has slightly changed, their personalities seem to be the same.</p><br/><p>No lapses in memory, and their souls are properly attached to thier bodies.</p><br/><p>However, each one has acquired the extra skill\u300ePerfect Memory\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cThis way, no matter how many times we die, we\u2019ll resurrect!\u300d</p><br/><p>They said as a joke\u2026 or not?</p><br/><p>Extra skill\u300cPerfect Memory\u300dis a skill related to soul memory.</p><br/><p>What is normally impossible, but they have now acquired a skill reserved for spiritual lifeforms only.</p><br/><p>After each one offered their greeting, they all returned to work on the festival.</p><br/><p>Whether to celebrate their new-found power or what, they decided to hold a festival.</p><br/><p>But, when they started coming up with hilarious names for it, like\u300eMaou\u2019s Birthday Party\u300for\u300eLet\u2019s Worship Rimuru-sama Party\u300ffor example, I sincerely wanted to stop them.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>They can have all the fun they want today. After all, they are in very festive mood already.</p><br/><p>For a festival-loving Japanese that I am, any reason is good enough.</p><br/><p>Since coming up with some random reason to drink heavily is in every adult\u2019s nature.</p><br/><p>I had offered to help, but with grand reverence they rejected my offer.</p><br/><p>Well, I can\u2019t boast in my ability to prepare festivals anyways, so I\u2019ll rest up as requested.</p><br/><p>Then, a person I have been seeing around here a lot ran up to me.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour awakening fills me with endless joy.</p><br/><p>Allow me to congratulate you from the bottom of my heart for your rebirth as a demon lord\u300d</p><br/><p>He says, bowing deeply.</p><br/><p>Who\u2019s that? Seems like a very high ranked demon, but I don\u2019t know\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd please pardon the rudeness, but regarding my earlier request to become your humble servant\u2026</p><br/><p>How shall you respond? Have you made your decision?\u300d</p><br/><p>Becoming my servant\u2026 he says?</p><br/><p>Umm, I do remember summoning one or two greater demons\u2026</p><br/><p>But no matter how I look at him, he\u2019s clearly beyond them?</p><br/><p>I was sleepy back then and couldn\u2019t see very well, so could he be one of them\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you the one I summoned using the soldiers\u2019 corpses?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs you say. It was truly a delicious meal.</p><br/><p>As a result, I was successfully able to materialize.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Ah, is that so. Good for you\u300d</p><br/><p>What about the other two?</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. The\u3008Secret Revival Art\u3009was lacking the necessary energy.</p><br/><p>Thus, and to fulfill their wish, they have been used and erased.\u226b</p><br/><p>Wow.</p><br/><p>Raphael is saying such terrifying things with such a happy tone.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s even more heartless than Great Sage, and just showing off that wicked personality. And though I thought it useless a little bit ago, it has been supporting me from the shadows this whole time.</p><br/><p>Sorry for thinking that you are useless.</p><br/><p>However, to use up those demons that wanted only to be of use to me is just sad\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, got it. From now on you are one of my comrades.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s your name?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh! You are too kind. But one such as I am a mere nameless demon.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmm? A high ranked existence but nameless, huh.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t be helped. Let\u2019s give him a name.</p><br/><p>But what name would be good?</p><br/><p>Demons that I know of\u2026 There\u2019s the one that became humanity\u2019s ally.</p><br/><p>There won\u2019t be any copyright violations if I use it, right? But, since this is a different world, I probably won\u2019t be sued\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah, whatever.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright. In that case, you won\u2019t mind if I give you a name, will you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWill you truly? \u2018Tis the greatest reward imaginable!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>His beautiful face curved in a delighted smile.</p><br/><p>Yep, I really am predisposed to be loved by monsters.</p><br/><p>Time to get serious.</p><br/><p>This time, super car series.</p><br/><p>Was it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cYour name shall be Diablo.</p><br/><p>Receive that name, and become my guardian deity!\u300d</p><br/><p>The moment I named him a considerable amount of energy escaped me.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve really gotten used to feeling this. But hey, he took only half, at most.</p><br/><p>I mean, I was worried that being a high demon and all he\u2019ll take all of it, but\u2026</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, when I named the Greater Demon Beretta I was left with only a third of what I had; I guess a Greater Demon is also a high ranked existence.</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. Individual: Diablo was an Archdemon to begin with.</p><br/><p>As the result of the evolution, Master\u2019s total magical energy amount has greatly increased.</p><br/><p>Compared to the original amount, it is now ten times as large\u226b</p><br/><p>Y-yeah.</p><br/><p>Did Raphael just randomly decide to offer the advice\u2026 But, I seem to have said something inexcusable.</p><br/><p>I mean, I\u2019m happy that it is now ten times larger, but he took a half of that?!</p><br/><p>This is\u2026 that, right? \u201cOops, I did it again\u201d feeling?</p><br/><p>Won\u2019t he become some absurdly powerful fiend.</p><br/><p>The demon in front of me, kneeling, stopped moving. A black cocoon enveloped his body creating a perfect evolution posture.</p><br/><p>Yep, I\u2019ve done it again.</p><br/><p>No cure for stupidity, so nothing I can do about this now.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s just hope that should it decide to rampage, that I\u2019ll be able to stop it.</p><br/><p>Since the evolution did not look like it was going to end soon, I just left him there.</p><br/><p>From now on: let\u2019s be careful about naming monsters!</p><br/><p>I promised to myself but was confident that I wouldn\u2019t keep this promise.</p><br/><p>Having completely forgotten about Diablo, I spent the time watching the festival preparations.</p><br/><p>While everyone was merrily fulfilling their tasks, I was dreading the meal prepared by Shion.</p><br/><p>And then, it came.</p><br/><p>The feared, Shion\u2019s Cooking\u2026 also known as the most lethal weapon around.</p><br/><p>With a bright, happy smile she brought me the meal(?).</p><br/><p>Time to say my prayers. It\u2019s here.</p><br/><p>Beholding the steaming dish,</p><br/><p>\u300cW-waaaaaait~! What is this? What the hell is this?\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not food.</p><br/><p>I shall not permit anyone to recognize this as cooking.</p><br/><p>A bunch of things flowing in the broth? Was she trying to make\u2026 Stew?</p><br/><p>Listen girl, when someone questions your food, you\u2019ve already lost.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, hey! Shion, wait. I have something I need to ask.</p><br/><p>Have you ever heard the phrase \u201cprepare the ingredients\u201d?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course, Rimuru-sama! How does it look? Doesn\u2019t it look delicious?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou fool!</p><br/><p>Why are carrots, potatoes, peppers, onions, and the other ingredients floating whole in there?!</p><br/><p>So that you can tell them apart by looking or something?</p><br/><p>You have to peel and cut them first!\u300d</p><br/><p>I screamed.</p><br/><p>And when I saw Benimaru walking by,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s this all about? There\u2019s clearly been no improvement?\u300d</p><br/><p>Dodging my words like holy water, Benimaru shrugged,</p><br/><p>\u300cNope, this is impossible for me.</p><br/><p>I have hit a wall. A wall called reality.</p><br/><p>I had never thought that something could be impossible, but this time I tasted defeat\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, scooting away.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with \u201ca wall called reality\u201d crap. Stop screwing with me.</p><br/><p>I have to eat it, huh\u2026?</p><br/><p>When I look at Shion, her eyes are full of tears and she\u2019s trembling.</p><br/><p>No choice, opening my heart to the unknown like a monk, I decided to take the first step towards nirvana\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cGot it, I\u2019ll eat it.</p><br/><p>But, next time, please at least prepare the ingredients\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, about that. I did try, but I end up cutting the building\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, the \u201cHercules\u2019 Edge\u201d is plenty sharp, but it\u2019s a little long\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Pointing at the odachi on her back.</p><br/><p>She was cooking, no.,.. trying to cook with that?!</p><br/><p>When I looked at Benimaru, he held up his arms as if giving up.</p><br/><p>What an undependable guy. My opinion of him is quickly falling.</p><br/><p>\u300cA sword is not a tool for cooking. You get it?</p><br/><p>Surely there\u2019s a knife around or something?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I am one with \u201cHercules\u2019 Edge\u201d so cheating on it is a bit\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, is that so. I thought of giving you a knife as a present soon, but I guess there\u2019s no need for that now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI was wrong! \u201cHercules\u2019 Edge\u201d is perfectly fine with me cheating on it, it said!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026 I\u2019ll give you knife some time soon, so please use that to cook\u300d</p><br/><p>What a good person.</p><br/><p>That should do it. At least, the ingredients shouldn\u2019t come out like that anymore.</p><br/><p>If I at this food\u2026 no, I refuse to recognize it as food!.. If I ate this thing, I should acquire\u300ePoison Resistance\u300fI guess.</p><br/><p>It\u2019ll probably be useful from now on.</p><br/><p>No choice, I have evolved into a demon lord. I won\u2019t die from eating some food.</p><br/><p>I change into my human form, and commit myself to eating it.</p><br/><p>Steeling myself, I \u201cwelcome\u201d some unknown substance into my mouth.</p><br/><p>Without chewing, I swallow\u2026 Huh? Something\u2019s wrong.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s pretty damn delicious.</p><br/><p>N-no way! Though it looks completely inedible.</p><br/><p>I open my eyes, and, with utmost care, eat another spoonful.</p><br/><p>Delicious\u2026</p><br/><p>Benimaru was looking at me, as if praying. His eyes were asking me whether I was alright.</p><br/><p>Which means that when Benimaru tasted it, it was really bad.</p><br/><p>Shion has a triumphant smile on her face.</p><br/><p>That did annoy me a bit.</p><br/><p>P 456</p><br/><p>\u300cShion, what is this\u2026</p><br/><p>Why, unlike how it looks, it tastes great?\u300d</p><br/><p>Fufufu, the thing is\u2026</p><br/><p>She said, and began the explanation\u2026</p><br/><p>In short, in the middle of the evolution, when she needed to express her dearest wishes, she wished for her cooking to be delicious.</p><br/><p>I bet only she made such a wish during my gift granting ceremony.</p><br/><p>What was she thinking, seriously?</p><br/><p>But, I guess that\u2019s just like her; no, this is just who Shion is.</p><br/><p>\u300cEhehe. Thus, I obtained this skill.</p><br/><p>The name, unique skill\u300eCook\u300f!\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m so amazed I have nothing to say.</p><br/><p>To obtain a unique skill in order to cook, just how persistent was she?</p><br/><p>When I asked about it, apparently no matter what she uses, it turns out delicious.</p><br/><p>When Shuna found out about this, her eyes were full of tears of despair and hatred. Well, for someone who strives hard to succeed, such a skill is unforgivable.</p><br/><p>But Shion has completely went off course trying to improve.</p><br/><p>Well, that is just like her, I guess.</p><br/><p>The day was thus in preparations of the festival, and we partied deep into the night.</p><br/><p>Completely erasing the air of tragedy of a few days ago, the city with filled with smiling faces.</p><br/><p>Youmu and Ellen also participated in the festival, and thoroughly enjoyed themselves.</p><br/><p>There are a lot of loose ends to fix tomorrow, and we need to discuss the future.</p><br/><p>But, not now.</p><br/><p>Now, let\u2019s enjoy our lives to the fullest.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s just our way of life.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There's no battle now anyway, so no problems there.</p><br/><p>But, would using skills on the level of\u300eScorch King Velgrynd\u300for\u300eGluttony King Beelzebuth\u300fto synthesize be able to create something else?</p><br/><p>Back then, during our tea party with Guy, he said something about \"Sin\" skills being part of a \"Series\", I vaguely remembered him saying something like that......</p><br/><p>(Right, I should start synthesizing. But, aren't the Sin Series and Virtue(Angel) Series Skills kinda important?)</p><br/><p>\u300aThere are no problems. As higher tier abilities, collecting all 7 would grant a bonus that releases racial limits.</p><br/><p>The Sin Series would be the Demon race, and the Virtue Series would be the Angel race.</p><br/><p>That is why, to prevent the enemy from collecting the abilities, Guy\u30fbCrimson decided to take in Leon, which would be my speculation.\u300b</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>This talk about releasing racial limits, does that mean it comes after completing evolution, via souls?</p><br/><p>\u300aThat is correct.</p><br/><p>Currently, the Demon race has their evolution tree sealed.</p><br/><p>But, via Master's \"Naming\", and the offering of souls, that limit has been released for a handful of individuals.</p><br/><p>For the Angels, their evolution tree is not sealed, but their \"Free Will\" has been sealed instead.</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, Angra\u30fbMainyu has most likely released that seal by other means.</p><br/><p>For example, dominating the mind of a person, incarnated with an Angel's body, and using the abilities of said Angel that way, or with other similar means\u2015\u2015\u300b</p><br/><p>Ah, so that's it.</p><br/><p>Because the Angels had their \"Free Will\" sealed, that's why they're so weak. No wonder it felt odd.</p><br/><p>Compared to the Demons who had free will, the Angels lacking it was unnatural no matter how you looked at it.</p><br/><p>Speaking of unnatural, the rules of evolving for the Demons was weird too.</p><br/><p>If they had matured naturally, the highest they could reach was only ever up to Arc Demon tier.</p><br/><p>Even the Demons, who had lived a really long time, why were they unable to evolve to the Demon Noble tier?, I thought.</p><br/><p>Through this, both sides were balanced out.</p><br/><p>A fight would result from just the two races meeting. This looks like the work of someone, as a means to balance them.</p><br/><p>My bet\u2019s on Veldanava.</p><br/><p>In the underworld, there was most likely only 1 Demon Noble that existed, who had been tasked with the role of administrator.</p><br/><p>Arc Demons that were recently born, and veteran Arc Demons like Diablo and Testarossa were existences of incomparable charisma.</p><br/><p>That is obvious, as they had no power to evolve naturally.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t known since when, but it was thought that further evolution was impossible, without collecting all the 7 Sin Series Skills.</p><br/><p>If you think about it this way, that time when Guy suddenly showed up right when there was an influx of Demon Nobles under me, I can now comprehend his actions.</p><br/><p>The Angels were all \"enslaved\" under\u300eJustice King Michael\u300f with their wills sealed.</p><br/><p>By collecting all 7 of the Virtue Series Skills, the wills of the affected Angels would be released.</p><br/><p>But, rather than incarnating as an Angel, it would be akin to obtaining control of an Angel with free will.</p><br/><p>There is no doubt that the side that releases their \u2018seal\u2019 first would gain the upper hand.</p><br/><p>Thinking as such, Guy prioritized collecting the Sin Series Skills. At the same time, he brought over someone(Leon) who had an Angel Series skill, thus impeding the Angel\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>With that train of thought, it is possible that there is a group that was collecting the Skills to release the Angel\u2019s side too.</p><br/><p>Hmm, wait a sec....</p><br/><p>It should have been a good choice for Rudra to be the one leading the Angels that had lost their will.</p><br/><p>But that would imply that only because of the seal on the Angels' wills, the seal on the demons was implemented to balance it out.</p><br/><p>While granting Rudra\u300eJustice King Michael\u300f, it was thrown in as a bonus of sorts?</p><br/><p>Well, it's pointless to think about such things right now anyways.</p><br/><p>This underlying mechanism between the Sin Series and Virtue Series isn't really relevant to me.</p><br/><p>The evolution of Demons has not been a problem for me anyway.</p><br/><p>(Doesn't look like there's any problems. Alright, I'll leave it to you! Ah, wai....)</p><br/><p>\u300aUnderstood! Beginning the process right away!!\u300b</p><br/><p>Looking back, I was a man who repeated his mistakes.</p><br/><p>It's never a good idea to say \"leave it to you\", haven't I regretted this countless times! Why, did I do it again....</p><br/><p>Before I could even stop her, Ciel, who was fully prepared, began the synthesizing of my abilities.</p><br/><p>It is possible that me giving the green light accidentally, then frantically trying to stop the process, was all within range of her predictions.</p><br/><p>With fearsome speed, the synthesis began immediately after I had consented.</p><br/><p>As though having waited forever in a \"Stay!\" position, she worked at a furious pace...... (EN: stay! as in like a pet dog)</p><br/><p>Ahh, she's definitely doing something unbelievably amazing, I thought, having kind of given up trying to stop her.</p><br/><p>Now then.</p><br/><p>The synthesis felt pleasant this time, as it ended without me going into Sleep Mode.</p><br/><p>That was expected though.</p><br/><p>Since I was asked for consent in the middle of a battle, if the process caused me to go into Sleep Mode, even I would get pissed.</p><br/><p>It took more than 48 hours to complete the process; During that time, I had no problems with everyday activities.</p><br/><p>(So, how's it looking this time?)</p><br/><p>Taking my question as a chance, Ciel happily began to explain the results.</p><br/><p>\u300aFirst, using\u300eWisdom Lord Raphael\u300fand\u300eGluttony King Beelzebuth\u300fI synthes\u2015\u2015\u300b</p><br/><p>(Ooooi!! Wait wait wait wait\u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>What did she say just now!?</p><br/><p>This fella, what did she just let slip? \u300eWisdom Lord Raphael\u300f, which was her original \"body\" of sorts, was used as a part of synthesis!?</p><br/><p>Is there a problem? was the impression that Ciel gave, but I calmed down and started a Q&amp;A with her.</p><br/><p>But, looks like I wasn't mistaken about what I heard. I do know it's kinda impossible to be mistaken about such things though......</p><br/><p>Although I kind of expected it, it's still shocking nonetheless.</p><br/><p>After that, I continued my Q&amp;A with Ciel-sensei, and confirmed the results of my ability synthesis.</p><br/><p>I definitely should have confirmed the contents before beginning the process.</p><br/><p>My abilities after the synthesis, looked nothing like what it was before.</p><br/><p>More like, it felt horrifying to merely call it synthesis. Well, it is what it is.</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Ultimate Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Blessing: Great Demon Lord's Blessing</p><br/><p>Title: \"Great Demon Lord\"</p><br/><p>Magic: \u3008True Dragon species Magic\u3009\u3008Upper tier Spirit Summoning\u3009</p><br/><p>\u3008Upper tier Demon Summoning\u3009, etc</p><br/><p>Skills: Manas: Ciel</p><br/><p> \u30fb Thought Acceleration\u30fbAppraisal\u30fbParallel Processing</p><br/><p>\u30fbFusion\u30fbSeparation\u30fbChant Annulment</p><br/><p>\u30fbAll of Creation\u30fbFood Chain\u30fbetc</p><br/><p>Ultimate Skill(s)</p><br/><p>\u300eVoid God Azathoth\u300f</p><br/><p>\u30fb Soul Consumption\u30fbTurn Null[1]\u30fbImaginary Room</p><br/><p>\u30fbSpace Time Control\u30fbMulti-Dimensional Barrier</p><br/><p>\u30fbTrue Dragon Release\u30fbTrue Dragon Core Transformation</p><br/><p>\u300eHarvest Lord Shub Niggurath\u300f</p><br/><p> \u30fb Skill Creation\u30fbSkill Duplication</p><br/><p>\u30fbSkill Gifting\u30fbSkill Bank</p><br/><p>Normal Skills...\u300eUniversal Perception\u300f\u300eGreat Demon Lord's Haki\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eUniversal Body Transformation\u300f</p><br/><p>Combat Skills...\u300eLaw Manipulation\u300f\u300eElement Alteration\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eTelepathy Control\u300f\u300eClairvoyance\u300f</p><br/><p>Resistances: Physical Attack Nullification, Natural Elements Nullification,</p><br/><p>Abnormal Status Nullification, Mental Attack Nullification,</p><br/><p>Hybrid Attack Resistance</p><br/><p>The results looked like this.</p><br/><p>This isn't on the level of just \"refreshing\".</p><br/><p>Though it was shocking how nonchalantly she expended\u300eWisdom Lord Raphael\u300f, which was her original \"body\", it kind of became an empty husk.</p><br/><p>For Ciel, there were no deep emotions, she just went on with her work without any hint of sentimentality.</p><br/><p>Her thoroughness was to the point that she had been sacking any and all unneeded skills.</p><br/><p>Also, my title had somehow become \"Great Demon Lord\"; I lost Divine Protection and instead have Divine Blessing.</p><br/><p>From the one being protected, to the one giving protection it seems.</p><br/><p>While I was still a Demon Lord, I shared both protection and blessing with Veldora, but now, that's not possible any more.[2]</p><br/><p>Having the title \"Great Demon Lord\" means that I have multiple Demon Lord level followers; there is clear difference in our positions.</p><br/><p>It was kind of concealed, but I was notified of the change in title by the \"Voice of the World\".</p><br/><p>Next, about my abilities, it really became some out-of-this-world stuff.</p><br/><p>So, first up.</p><br/><p>Synthesizing\u300eWisdom Lord Raphael\u300fand\u300eGluttony King Beelzebuth\u300f,\u300eVoid God Azathoth\u300fwas born.</p><br/><p>It seems\u300eStorm King Veldora\u300fand\u300eScorch King Velgrynd\u300fwere expended too, with only certain abilities being inherited.</p><br/><p>Although the summoning abilities were lost, I didn't really make use of them as they had time limitations, so it isn't a big deal. Instead, the Release abilities got improved.</p><br/><p>True Dragon Core Transformation is, word for word, an ability that manifests a Blade Core. I still need to get consent from the actual person(dragon), but this is way too powerful for normal use anyway.</p><br/><p>Instead, I can now create Pseudo-cores too, which are watered down and expendable. At roughly 5% of the original output, even that is pretty amazing, and it makes them more conventionally usable.</p><br/><p>Also, I can produce Velgrynd's Pseudo-Scorch cores too, but....</p><br/><p>It is also possible to manifest Velgrynd as a Blade Core, but getting her consent is most likely impossible, so getting her Pseudo-cores is also kinda difficult.[3]</p><br/><p>The most important point, is that the Pseudo-cores don't affect True Dragon Release. I can make them at any time without the need for consent, this makes it a very attractive ability.</p><br/><p>But, the True Dragon related abilities aren\u2019t the problem.</p><br/><p>The really nasty ones, are the main abilities that were synthesized for Void God Azathoth.</p><br/><p>Soul Consumption... The upgraded version of Predate. Consumes everything, including the target's soul.</p><br/><p>Turn Null...An immensely destructive Energy produced from a chaotic, nuclear dimension. Controllable via Manas.</p><br/><p>Imaginary Room... A dimension made to isolate any and all targets. The upgraded version of\u300eStomach\u300f\uff0b\u300eIsolate\u300f.</p><br/><p>Space Time Control... Instantaneous travel is possible with my will alone.</p><br/><p>Multi-Dimensional Barrier... An always active, multi-layered barrier. An absolute defense that makes use of dimensional gaps.</p><br/><p>That, was what Ciel-sensei explained them as.</p><br/><p>Frankly, I wasn't expecting upgrades of this level....</p><br/><p>Where\u2019d that Stellar Wind Lord Hastur go off to! I didn't even have the spirit to make that \"jab\".</p><br/><p>As long as I had Void God Azathoth, the other abilities weren't needed, I thought.</p><br/><p>Secondly, what looked like the pot that received the remaining skills, was\u300eHarvest Lord Shub Niggurath\u300f.</p><br/><p>This was simply, a skill made for my followers.</p><br/><p>Skill Creation... Information that has been gathered by\u300eFood Chain\u300fand\u300eAnalysis\u300f, are used to create new skills.</p><br/><p>Skill Duplication... The ability to make copies of obtained skills.</p><br/><p>Skill Gifting... The ability to grant the copied skills onto the target. Can also remove the granted skills.</p><br/><p>Skill Bank... Turns skills that have been obtained into information and stores them, able to reproduce the skills at any time.</p><br/><p>Turning the hefty amount of skills that have been consumed into information, it's now all stored nicely.</p><br/><p>Plus, they can be reproduced whenever. Now that is one absurd ability.</p><br/><p>Granting a Gift to my followers, has also become possible. But regarding that, there was compatibility of the follower etc. to consider.</p><br/><p>It's not as if anyone can use those overpowered abilities.</p><br/><p>Those kinds of details, I can let Ciel handle. Her habit of \"Remodelling\" is still around, but she can't do the impossible.</p><br/><p>These 2 skills were what was obtained this time.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, this looks way too powered up compared to before the synthesis.</p><br/><p>I did think this was overdoing it at first, however, thinking of the future confrontation with Angra Mainyu got me to re-evaluate my thoughts.</p><br/><p>I want to properly conclude this mess, and get on with fully enjoying my life here.</p><br/><p>And so, my ability synthesis, courtesy of Ciel-sensei, concludes.</p><br/><p>At the same time as my ability synthesis completed, the evolution of the Executives also concluded.</p><br/><p>All of them had their compatibilities guided by Ciel-sensei, and their abilities optimized.</p><br/><p>Well that much was kind of expected, it looks like Gifting effects also had some impact there.</p><br/><p>It looks like Shion is the only one who has yet to ascend for some reason, everyone else has safely ascended.</p><br/><p>How have they all turned out....</p><br/><p>Up first, Benimaru.</p><br/><p>Name: Benimaru</p><br/><p>Species: Flame Spirit Oni (Upper tier Divine Monster Spirit[4])</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: Great Demon Lord's Blessing</p><br/><p>Title: \"Flare Lord (King of Vermillion Rage)\"</p><br/><p>Magic: \u3008Flame spirit magic\u3009</p><br/><p>Skills: Ultimate Skill</p><br/><p>\u300eBlazing Sun Lord Amaterasu\u300f</p><br/><p> ...

Albeit lower than the True Dragons, he is still an Elemental Divine Spirit nonetheless.</p><br/><p>Obviously, his stats improved drastically, saying his strength was greater than an awakened demon lord wouldn't be an understatement.</p><br/><p>As Zegion still has a physical body, just comparing that alone would make Benimaru the victor in a battle between the two.</p><br/><p>Fact is, Benimaru, Diablo, and Zegion, has secured the top 3 positions from what it looks like.</p><br/><p>Moving on, Souei.</p><br/><p>Name: Souei</p><br/><p>Species: Dark Spirit Oni (Middle tier Divine Monster Spirit)</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: The Flare Lord's Shadow</p><br/><p>Title: \"Darkness (Master of the Dark)\"</p><br/><p>Magic: \u3008Dark Spirit Magic\u3009</p><br/><p>Skills: Ultimate Gift</p><br/><p>\u300eShadow Moon Lord Tsukuyomi\u300f</p><br/><p> ...

It is capable of observing anywhere in the world with the option to add sound too, and the information can be processed and turned into a video.</p><br/><p>As expected, for being fully specialized in spying activities, he\u2019s turned into a pretty dependable guy.</p><br/><p>As the one who grasps all information in Tempest, he was granted the title of \"Darkness(Master of the Dark)\".</p><br/><p>Ranga.</p><br/><p>Name: Ranga</p><br/><p>Species: Wind Spirit Wolf (Upper tier Divine Monster Spirit)</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: Great Demon Lord's Blessing</p><br/><p>Title: \"Star Lord (Stellar Wolf King)\"</p><br/><p>Magic: \u3008Wind Spirit Magic\u3009</p><br/><p>Skills: Ultimate Skill</p><br/><p>\u300eStellar Wind Lord Hastur\u300f</p><br/><p> ...

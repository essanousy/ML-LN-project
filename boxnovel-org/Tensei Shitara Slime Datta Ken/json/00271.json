Strong monsters will probably come out so be sure to be on guard.\u201d</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-671\"></span>Since they had no problems today, I just gave a simple advice.<span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-673\"></span></p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think there will be any but I would like to avoid any casualties caused from a lack of awareness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you are worrying for us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for your worry! There\u2019s no way Magnus-sama will be taken off by lowly monsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl who is always beside Magnus raged.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. Well, either way, don\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood up as I said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, I know. Rosary, calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am calm!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that behind me, I left to tidy up.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-672\"></span><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-674\"></span></p><br/><p>That night.</p><br/><p>Feeling the presence of a sleeping magic activate, I opened my eyes.</p><br/><p>As this body is really close to a human\u2019s body, it is possible for me to imitate sleeping by thinning out my consciousness but since I have no need for sleep, sleeping magic doesn\u2019t work on me.</p><br/><p>However, the target for the magic wasn\u2019t me\u2014it was the other female students sleeping in my tent.</p><br/><p>Marsha, Aina and two others.</p><br/><p>I was put in their tent. I told them I was fine with the boys\u2019 tent but was rejected by everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, I am a guy\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019re a guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>They told me they were worried more about me than themselves.</p><br/><p>As I was also being persuaded by George and Mondo who didn\u2019t believe me at all, I decided to bend since it was getting bothersome.</p><br/><p>Or rather, since I am used to being cared by Shuna or Shion, this much doesn\u2019t really disturb me.</p><br/><p>And as such, I was in the same tent as the girls but\u2013</p><br/><p>This doesn\u2019t seem to be a sneak visit.</p><br/><p>\u201cSatoru-dono, are you there?\u2019</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>I could hear a small voice calling for me.</p><br/><p>I was thinking of going to them myself but it seems they came contacting me first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered to the call and quietly exited the tent.</p><br/><p>The one who greeted me by kneeling as if it was only normal was William Loaz, the elder magic instructor of Ingracia Synthesis Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou noticed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I realized with one glance. However, Souei-sama said to keep it a secret in his message so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>From what he explained while we were changing locations, it seems this elder William is one of Souei\u2019s spies.</p><br/><p>Even though I say spy, he is actually a subordinate of a subordinate of Souka.</p><br/><p>It seems all of the spies lurking in each of the countries started moving as I gave the order to Souei to investigate the academies.</p><br/><p>Even though I say that, these spies normally look for the country\u2019s movements and so small stuff like investigating the academies aren\u2019t included in their job.</p><br/><p>They are people who deal with things on a much greater scale.</p><br/><p>They normally gather circumstantial evidence of interior corruption or expose injustice. And it seems there were also people who were in the academies to investigate.</p><br/><p>William was also one of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought my heart would stop when I received the direct <em><i>Thought Transmission</i></em> from Souei-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said, probably remembering of that time, as he trembled a bit.</p><br/><p>That is true.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\">Translations by AsianHobbyist Website</div><br/><p>I understand his feeling\u2014being directly contacted by someone who is like above the clouds.</p><br/><p>It even seems he is more afraid of Souei than me.</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s probably it.</p><br/><p>Souei is\u2014no, Souei and everyone in the information department are quite strict on their subordinates\u2026</p><br/><p>It seems they don\u2019t have the expression \u2018in the worst case scenario\u2019 in their dictionary.</p><br/><p>Failure=death \u2014 they are even feared by other sections.</p><br/><p>I was lead to the tent made for the instructors.</p><br/><p>As I entered, the instructors knelt down.</p><br/><p>Brown, the guy who lost to Laplace at first, Pury, the doctor and Blum, the plump, old man.</p><br/><p>There was also this other guy, called Heinrich, who seemed like an intelligent researcher. He is the guy who identified the mana storm covering the island.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-12\"></div><br/><p>And\u2013</p><br/><p>Shaking in his boots was the instructor who gave me salt before, Instructor A\u2014or as I came to know later, Peter-sensei.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? If it isn\u2019t Peter-sensei.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGyaaahh\u2014! P-please forgive me!\u201d</p><br/><p>What a wonderful dogeza.</p><br/><p>He went from kneeling to a jumping dogeza.</p><br/><p>Really, this is my first seeing it\u2026 a jumping dogeza.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cR-really?! Then, you will forgive me?\u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered what was there to forgive? \u2014but his reactions are too suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I decide on that, tell me what you did.\u201d</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t think that he would be this scared just from treating me like that.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I thought when asking him but\u2026</p><br/><p>One after another came out, his events of neglect.</p><br/><p>It seems even for the tents, it was just him choosing to not be bothered to tidying it up.</p><br/><p>I was exasperated, listening to his trivial sins confessions.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. 3 months of salary cut.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\">Translations by AsianHobbyist Website</div><br/><p>\u201cHa, eh? Hahaa!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, don\u2019t slack off from now on, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-of course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is too stupid so I let Peter off the hook with a salary cut.</p><br/><p>And then.</p><br/><p>They introduced themselves formally once again.</p><br/><p>All the instructors here are all under the supervision of the information department.</p><br/><p>In other words, they are enthusiastic fellows who haven\u2019t been corrupted.</p><br/><p>All the three Tempest\u2019s instructors in the island were here.</p><br/><p>Actually, Peter here is also a battle type instructor from Tempest.</p><br/><p>I am glad that there were no corrupted instructors in my home, Tempest.</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t know what is happening at the actual academy, since Souei should be entering there now. Either way, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any here so that\u2019s good.</p><br/><p>And from the Ingracia Synthesis Academy were William and Blum.</p><br/><p>Heinrich was the only one from NNU Magic and Science Investigation Academy.</p><br/><p>These people were the collaborators.</p><br/><p>Either way, I can trust these 6.</p><br/><p>I decided to drag these 6 in this and started a discussion on what to do next.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

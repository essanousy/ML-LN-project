Forest Assailants</p><br/><p>When I confirmed that the barrier has indeed fallen, I decided to finally come out.</p><br/><p>At the exact same moment,</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you well, my master!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ranga worriedly jumped out of the shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problems\u201d, I tell him while confirming the state of my body.</p><br/><p>Seems like I\u2019m okay, the skill returned to what it originally was.</p><br/><p>Seriously, what a screwed up tale this has become.</p><br/><p>What a horrible person she is! Picking a fight without even hearing what I had to say\u2026 well, I did play along, though.</p><br/><p>But, contrary to my expectations, I was defeated\u2026</p><br/><p>No, not defeated. They do say that escape is also a victory.</p><br/><p>\u201cWise men steer clear of trouble\u201d they say.</p><br/><p>As I thought\u2026 devoting myself to escape was the correct decision.</p><br/><p>Since I only tried to escape, now that I have, this is my victory!.. That\u2019s a little painful to say.</p><br/><p>So let\u2019s call it a draw.</p><br/><p>This was a really close call. I was able to survive thanks to the insurance I set up before hand, but this was almost the end of me.</p><br/><p>Since I felt overwhelmingly disadvantageous, I created a clone and planned my escape.</p><br/><p>Had I used magic energy to make it, she would have found out; so, instead, I physically separated a piece of my slime body and sent that away.</p><br/><p>I was able to escape thanks to the minimal activity state and thus avoided being affected by the battle, but it was still a pain.</p><br/><p>Had she foreseen my ability to split this way, that would have been the end\u2026</p><br/><p>But since she didn\u2019t know all of my abilities, she couldn\u2019t plan that far.</p><br/><p>And I guess no one would plan for it by default. Thus, I was saved.</p><br/><p>I timidly left the battlefield, and reached what used to be the boundary of the barrier, and thus lost some time.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d die if Hinata spotted me, so I devoted all my intention to hiding my presence. As a result, I was able to successfully escape, albeit with difficulty.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 Hinata is way too strong!</p><br/><p>With that strength she doesn\u2019t need a barrier\u2026 but she still goes out of her way to use it just in case. Seriously! Cut me some slack, will you?!</p><br/><p>This time, I couldn\u2019t even scratch her. She didn\u2019t even see a reason to wear armor\u2026</p><br/><p>Are all world travelers and summoned ones that strong?</p><br/><p>Seems like there are many skills for me to snatch away.</p><br/><p>By the way, this fight\u2019s harvest includes Hinata\u2019s rapier, the skill she used, and data on her magic.</p><br/><p>Even in Gluttony\u2019s rampage mode,\u300eGreat Sage\u300fkept up the data link.</p><br/><p>I also ordered it to record data for future reference. Honestly, I didn\u2019t believe I could win from the start.</p><br/><p>Moreover, \u201cDisintegration\u201d is so powerful it sent chills down my back. You can\u2019t protect yourself against that.</p><br/><p>Even a multiple layer barrier will be pierced resulting in death. No joke.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m really fortunate to have seen it. So in face of such magic, the only thing you can do is to run away or to interfere with the drawing of the magic circle.</p><br/><p>It would have been great if I could absorb and analyze it, but I had no such chance.</p><br/><p>Life isn\u2019t that easy.</p><br/><p>The moment I \u201csaw\u201d it, the data link was severed. And just receiving feedback from the clone made me feel dizzy.</p><br/><p>From what I saw, you can\u2019t evade it. Chances are, the target is marked by spell; so unless you dispel the barrier, you\u2019re a goner.</p><br/><p>Could Milim endure it? Let\u2019s ask her the next time we meet.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how much data I was able to acquire this time around. You could even say that this was my victory.</p><br/><p>But let\u2019s just call it a draw.</p><br/><p>No! I\u2019m not being a sore loser!</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t the time for jokes.</p><br/><p>I worry about Tempest.</p><br/><p>I tried transferring to Tempest. By the way, though I can feel the destination, I don\u2019t feel a response from it.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s bad, isn\u2019t it\u2026 is this the weak barrier that Hinata spoke of?</p><br/><p>I should return as quick as possible.</p><br/><p>\u300cOff we go!\u300d</p><br/><p>I said to Ranga.</p><br/><p>And, with a heavy heart, I transferred to the Cave of the Seal.</p><br/><p>In front of the cave, which was just outside the barrier, gathered Gabil and his troops.</p><br/><p>When he saw me,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh! Rimuru-sama, we are in trouble!\u300d</p><br/><p>He called out.</p><br/><p>Seems like my fears were coming true. I can only lament the time I lost fighting with Hinata.</p><br/><p>I have no time to chat here. Having so decided, I established a telepathic link with Gabil\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>And, while thus conversing, hurried into Tempest.</p><br/><p>This time, I forcefully accelerated their mental abilities, allowing them to report within a moment. As a result, I unfortunately put Gabil in charge, but this is the wrong time to mind such decisions.</p><br/><p>Thanks to this I got a feel for the situation.</p><br/><p>Here\u2019s what happened.</p><br/><p>About an hour ago, a report came in.</p><br/><p>They spoke via spirit communicators, and were thus able to hear the news.</p><br/><p>A number of assailants have come, it said.</p><br/><p>Souei intended to find out their identity via shadow step, but he couldn\u2019t use it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, telepathy stopped working.</p><br/><p>So, though slightly panicked, they remembered about the spirit communicators.</p><br/><p>Created as a spare, we were fortunate that it allowed conversation between the cave and the city.</p><br/><p>According to the information Gabil heard, the adventurers were also in a state of panic.</p><br/><p>And, approximately 15 minutes ago, the reports stopped coming.</p><br/><p>So Gabil told me.</p><br/><p>Gabil\u2019s group was ordered to protect the cave by Rigurdo.</p><br/><p>But they were very worried about the city so were arguing whether or not to send a scout.</p><br/><p>To send or not to send\u2013they couldn\u2019t get their priorities straight which resulted in a split of opinion.</p><br/><p>(Alright, I got it. You guys retreat and protect the cave.</p><br/><p>Please capture the invaders without killing them)</p><br/><p>(Ay! By the way, Bester-dono is asking whether he can make a trip to the Dwarf Kingdom?)</p><br/><p>(Ah, have him wait for a bit. When the situation becomes clearer I don\u2019t particularly mind, but right now is no good)</p><br/><p>(Understood! Please take care of yourself!)</p><br/><p>The telepathic link was cut.</p><br/><p>15 minutes, huh\u2026</p><br/><p>Had it not been for Hinata\u2019s meddling, I would have made it.</p><br/><p>Steeling my heart, I shadow step closer to the city. Chances are if I leap into the city, I won\u2019t be able to leave the shadow.</p><br/><p>So I leap close enough to fly to it.</p><br/><p>That leap I was able to make without a problem. And\u3008Flying Magic\u3009set at highest speed, I headed for the city.</p><br/><p>The barrier spread around the city put up a resistance. But, holding my left hand in front of me, I absorbed a part of the barrier and thus broke through.</p><br/><p>After successfully entering the city I felt the barrier mend behind me.</p><br/><p>Inside, the magic concentration has dropped significantly, but magic energy properly flows.</p><br/><p>This barrier is clearly inferior to the Holy Barrier used against me.</p><br/><p>What a relief\u2026</p><br/><p>After entering the city premises I hurry to the center square.</p><br/><p>A large crowd has gathered in the city; their faces gloomy.</p><br/><p>Something happened it seems. My heart quickened in anxiety.</p><br/><p>After noticing my arrival, the group opened a path and knelt before me. And, in this state, a few people appeared before me.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo and Kaijin.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, we are overjoyed that you have returned to us. There are matters we must hear your opinion on, so please come this way\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>They are\u2026 preventing me from continuing forward?</p><br/><p>Seems like there\u2019s something up ahead. I have a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>\u300cRigurdo, Kaijin. Move of out the way. What happened?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN-nothing. Some small problems here and there, so for now\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t try to hide it. Move\u300d</p><br/><p>At my command, the people timidly cleared the way.</p><br/><p>What appeared before me, that scene.</p><br/><p>Countless monsters lay there.</p><br/><p>Men, women, and even children.</p><br/><p>Appearing as if they were sleeping\u2026</p><br/><p>All dead.</p><br/><p>Why has\u2026</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t feel my feet.</p><br/><p>What is this, what has\u2026? No good, I can\u2019t think straight.</p><br/><p>A total of 100 friends lay before me.</p><br/><p>Eh\u2026 all\u2026 are dead? You\u2019re lying, aren\u2019t you?!</p><br/><p>My mind doesn\u2019t focus. Though I have no need for it, I feel out of breath.</p><br/><p>Though I lack a heart, it beats violently in my chest.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is this, what happened?\u300d</p><br/><p>My voice escaped my lips.</p><br/><p>A cold voice that can be heard from far away.</p><br/><p>I felt my heart grow cold.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo explained to the trembling me,</p><br/><p>\u300cA while ago, we were attacked by a group which identified themselves as the followers of the Western Saint\u2019s Church.</p><br/><p>We suddenly lost contact with other groups, and due to the sudden lethargy we felt\u2026</p><br/><p>Furthermore, we were attacked by a group which disguised themselves as adventurers.\u300d</p><br/><p>Western Saint\u2019s Church\u2026 the group Hinata spoke of arrived faster than I expected.</p><br/><p>Next, a Hobgoblin elder continued</p><br/><p>\u300cAs you have ordered, we welcomed the humans with respect without harming them\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cF-fool! Are you trying to say this is Rimuru-sama\u2019s fault!\u300d</p><br/><p>Rigurdo countered, enraged.</p><br/><p>\u300cP-please forgive me! I meant no such\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>A distant apology resounded, but it did not reach my heart.</p><br/><p>I see, my order, my words caused this\u2026</p><br/><p>I am a monster.</p><br/><p>\u2026 who used to be a human.</p><br/><p>I just wanted to get along with humans.</p><br/><p>\u2026 reality is far more cruel.</p><br/><p>Then what should I be doing!!!</p><br/><p>\u2026 who knows? Think for yourself.</p><br/><p>A voice rang inside my head, denying responsibility.</p><br/><p>But I will not permit it. I am the cause of this tragedy; the responsibility is mine.</p><br/><p>I felt extreme regret and bottomless anger well-up within my heart.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Calling a conference of elders, we reconfirm the situation.</p><br/><p>Even in this shaken state, my mind was able to properly assess the situation.</p><br/><p>First, there were ten assailants.</p><br/><p>In ten minutes, they were able to kill a hundred of us.</p><br/><p>By the looks of it, the group that set up the barrier remained outside of it, so their actual numbers are unconfirmed.</p><br/><p>This is what they said,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe West Saint\u2019s Church has condemned this city as a den of monsters.</p><br/><p>Within a week, along with the Farmas Kingdom, we shall cleanse this land.</p><br/><p>We are lead by the great hero, King Edomarisu!</p><br/><p>If you choose to surrender, we shall guarantee your lives and existence in the name of our god.</p><br/><p>Cease the pointless struggle, and surrender.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, only death awaits you!</p><br/><p>Oh wise adventurers! You should know with whom justice lies.</p><br/><p>We hope you shall choose wisely. That is all!\u300d</p><br/><p>They said, and ran out.</p><br/><p>And while screaming so they mercilessly slaughtered women and children\u2026</p><br/><p>Benimaru seemed like he had something to say, but was holding it in\u2026 his face clearly in pain.</p><br/><p>But for them, who are in charge of taking care of the city, such a thing would never had occurred were it not for my order.</p><br/><p>My words have caused this tragedy.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe adventurers who have come here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNext door\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>We came over.</p><br/><p>A number of traders were there, totaling about 50 men.</p><br/><p>They said,</p><br/><p>\u300cAbout this, please\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe can fathom the reason behind Farmas Kingdom\u2019s aggression, but we the adventurers have come to like this place.</p><br/><p>We cannot accept the methods the Farmas Kingdom has employed.</p><br/><p>They said they will come to attack, would you let us help prepare the ambush?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, to make an enemy out of the church\u2026 what an unpleasant tale this has become\u300d</p><br/><p>And other such lines.</p><br/><p>I can feel their attentiveness towards our suffering.</p><br/><p>Feeling gratitude for their words,</p><br/><p>\u300cI appreciate the sentiment, but we will clean this mess up by ourselves this time.</p><br/><p>Rather, I would like you to bring news of this back as soon as possible\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, shouldn\u2019t we just send a messenger?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s no good\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>I explain my thoughts.</p><br/><p>Rather, what I suspect the people lying in wait are thinking.</p><br/><p>That we are blood thirsty monsters. They will kill the messenger themselves and pin the blame on us.</p><br/><p>So I tell them,</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 I see. That does make sense, but would they go so far?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe church which stands for justice?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo way\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>They replied.</p><br/><p>But,</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, wait a second. I remembered!</p><br/><p>Those guys might have been the infamous Blood Shadows.</p><br/><p>Remember how they even killed children without any hesitation?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? Ah, that rumor, huh\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. That does seem like their work\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you kidding me? To think they actually existed\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEven though a declaration of war immediately followed?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, that\u2019s just what you\u2019d expect from Blood Shadows\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cConsidering that their enemies are monsters\u2026 ah, my bad\u300d</p><br/><p>They suddenly got noisy.</p><br/><p>Seems like there\u2019s a rumor about a secret squad serving the church.</p><br/><p>A group that would laugh amidst a slaughter\u2013fanatics.</p><br/><p>But if that\u2019s the case, then we\u2019ve got a troublesome opponent on our hands.</p><br/><p>So, because we are monsters, they aren\u2019t recognizing us as a country but simply treating this as a subjugation request\u2026</p><br/><p>Which is why the adventurers should all leave right now.</p><br/><p>If they stay behind and die, they\u2019ll claim that we had done it.</p><br/><p>When I so told them, they reluctantly agreed.</p><br/><p>So we had them quickly pack up and prepare to leave the city.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo offered them to use our carts and wagons.</p><br/><p>Thus, with many parting words, we saw off our guests from Brumund Kingdom.</p><br/><p>They promised to let the country know and come back with reinforcements.</p><br/><p>But, will that happen?</p><br/><p>A single country could hardly make an enemy of the church.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t expect much from them. Not that we need the help.</p><br/><p>This is this country\u2019s problem; all I have to do is slaughter the perpetrators.</p><br/><p>Personally.</p><br/><p>After all, if I don\u2019t do anything, the pain and wrath that fills my heart will not subside\u2026</p><br/><p>Having confirmed their departure, I asked Rigurdo about something that has been bothering me for a while.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, where\u2019s Shion?</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t seen her yet\u300d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing these words, not just Rigurdo, but Benimaru, Souei, Hakurou, and Shuna all suddenly stopped moving.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with their reaction\u2026</p><br/><p>No way\u2026 could it be\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u300cThat idiot didn\u2019t go for revenge on her own, did she?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN-no\u2026 about that\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmm? Something\u2019s strange here.</p><br/><p>They are averting their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen where is she?\u300d</p><br/><p>No one answered.</p><br/><p>If I look closely, Shuna is stifling tears.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>Dread creeps up from the dark corners of my mind. But there\u2019s no way, please tell me that there\u2019s no way\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI got it. I won\u2019t be mad, so just tell me where she is\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I ask from Shuna.</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand\u2026 this way, I\u2019ll lead the way.\u300d</p><br/><p>Nodding at Benimaru\u2019s words, I follow him.</p><br/><p>To the center square.</p><br/><p>There was a girl lying among the fallen.</p><br/><p>Covered with a white cloth that didn\u2019t stand out from the rest.</p><br/><p>So that I wouldn\u2019t notice\u2013it did not stand out.</p><br/><p>Haha, to think that I haven\u2019t noticed\u2026 I can\u2019t laugh.</p><br/><p>Open your eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t believe this.</p><br/><p>Please open your eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>This can\u2019t be happening.</p><br/><p>Why? Why has this\u2026</p><br/><p>Shion protected a child\u2026,</p><br/><p>The magic energy concentration dropped\u2026,</p><br/><p>So her strength had fallen\u2026,</p><br/><p>Shion was always bad with barriers\u2026,</p><br/><p>And the sword that slashed her was the Ogre Eater magic sword\u2026</p><br/><p>The explanation was given, but I did not want to hear.</p><br/><p>My heart simply refused to listen.</p><br/><p>Shion, please open your eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>I want to cry but can\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Though my heart has been torn to shreds, this body does not feel the need to cry.</p><br/><p>I see\u2026 I am a monster after all.</p><br/><p>Somehow, I was pleased with that realization.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry. Can you leave me alone for a bit\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>At these words they all dispersed.</p><br/><p>For a bit, Shuna hugged me while crying\u2026 but then followed the rest.</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>I want to be alone.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t get myself.</p><br/><p>Though I feel insanity creeping in, my mind horribly calm.</p><br/><p>Extreme sadness, regret, wrath.</p><br/><p>These feelings mixed inside of me seeking an outlet.</p><br/><p>Why has this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution.

They would slowly encroach like that and before long would have the state in their palms.</p><br/><p>To make such a long-term plan\u2013It seems it was made by someone who has a broad outlook.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Let\u2019s say I didn\u2019t become aware of the organization at all\u2014I don\u2019t think it would have affected me still, since I don\u2019t have a life span\u2026 It would have been really bothersome to crush their plans one by one, by adjusting the course.</p><br/><p>But now that I do know of that, all I need to do is get a well-qualified person and order them to deal with it.</p><br/><p>It would also be easy to crush them.</p><br/><p>If they are looking for a fight with me, I will just have to crush them in their own game.</p><br/><p>Well, leaving that for later\u2026</p><br/><p>Even still\u2013</p><br/><p>That Magnus, it felt like he had strength left to spare even when dealing with a semi-demonlord class\u2026 isn\u2019t that a bit abnormal?</p><br/><p>Semi-demonlord class\u2026 to simplify it, they are as strong as Arch Demons.</p><br/><p>Although, for what it matters, having seen the fight myself, it felt like the opponent was lesser than a just-born Arch Demon in terms of strength but their strength was very much similar.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>That\u2019s probably because Poison Tiger is reigning over this island\u2019s ecosystem from the summit and has probably never had to fight seriously. On top of that, he\u2019s probably not used to fighting against someone on the same level as him.</p><br/><p>But either way, the threat he posed was real.</p><br/><p>There aren\u2019t many people who can go up against that alone.</p><br/><p>Among the humans, it\u2019s probably a handful of the high ranking Holy Knights.</p><br/><p>If Magnus is of the same level as a high ranking Holy Knight, he is too strong for a student.</p><br/><p>No, if he\u2019s a spy, there\u2019s a chance he has been lying about his age as well\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, either way, Magnus surely possesses unshakable strength which you can\u2019t acquire with just weapon ability.</p><br/><p>The way I am now\u2014with powers of a human, can I win against him?</p><br/><p>Of course I can.</p><br/><p>It would be a piece of cake if I just had to win.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>I only have the abilities of a human at the moment and my energy is low but my level is the same as before.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t matter if the opponent is a arch demon or a lesser demon lord. I would just dodge all their attacks with \u2018prediction analysis\u2019 and \u2018teleportation\u2019 and end them with \u2018imaginary blow\u2019, ignoring any kind of attribute and defense.</p><br/><p>However, if I were to do that, they would know my location.</p><br/><p>But if I don\u2019t teleport and use as low energy as possible to stop\u2014no, let\u2019s not.</p><br/><p>I even escaped to enjoy the ordinary life.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to expose my identity intentionally and show off my omnipotent powers.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t have to be me who defeats Magnus.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s Julius and Karma and their friends as well.</p><br/><p>I should give them the chance for revenge as well.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

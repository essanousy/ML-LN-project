There\u2019ll be no objection against calling him the strongest in Tempest.</p><br/><p>Well, how will it turn out?</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s live report will be conducted by Souka alone.</p><br/><p>Milim left taking Gobuta with her.</p><br/><p>Apparently she said she will retrain Gobuta for a whole day, she didn\u2019t seem interested in the final match.</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t know if it is a good or bad thing for Gobuta, it might be rare occasion to receive training and other things from Milim personally. I want him to do his best as much as possible.</p><br/><p>It seems he trained together with Karion-san the Lion Mask too, they should become good friends.</p><br/><p>Oh well, while praying for Gobuta\u2019s safety, let\u2019s watch the match.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then it\u2019s the last match! Final match, begin!!\u300d </p><br/><p>Final....... Benimaru vs Diablo</p><br/><p>On Souka\u2019s yell the match began.</p><br/><p>Kufufufufu.</p><br/><p>Diablo rejoiced, joy gushing forth from deep inside his mind.</p><br/><p>The one who summoned him was truly, a very wonderful Master.</p><br/><p>Though he lived for a long time, he\u2019d never come across a fight that made his heart pound like this.</p><br/><p>For him, fighting meant trampling down the opponent.</p><br/><p>The weak were only to be trampled down and get killed.</p><br/><p>After all, it\u2019s because there were only a few people that were able to hurt him who was a resident of the spirit world.</p><br/><p>Even when he rarely manifested in the physical world, it was very simple for him to slaughter people who lived there within the time he stayed there. That also includes the Summoner.</p><br/><p>After all, not knowing his own standing, the Summoner summoned Diablo who was a high rank being...</p><br/><p>It can only be said that it was a foolish act, he couldn\u2019t even protest if he retired from the living.</p><br/><p>To begin with, what kind of race is Demon RaceDemon?</p><br/><p>In the ancient past, during the time when the Spirits of Light and Dark were born, receiving the blessing of light, the Angel\u2019s Egg was laid, and receiving the wave of darkness the Demon\u2019s Seed was sowed.</p><br/><p>At the same time when Spirit of Time was born, the egg hatched, and the seed budded.</p><br/><p>The two were born as a conceptual existence with a pure energy body without a physical body</p><br/><p>That was the origin of Angels and Demons.</p><br/><p>The mysterious thing was that the Angels and Demons that were born at the same time were on bad terms.</p><br/><p>When they meet, fighting is unavoidable, long fights were repeatedly fought.</p><br/><p>However, because the effects of their fights were too large, unknowingly once in every 500 years they\u2019ll only fight for seven days, such an agreement was made.</p><br/><p>For Diablo who finds pleasure in fighting, such a peaceful period was the most tedious time.</p><br/><p>For them who don\u2019t have physical bodies, they don\u2019t have the ability to interfere with the physical world.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, he rejoiced when the summons from the new Demon Lord came, it marked the end of his monotonous time.</p><br/><p>That Demon Lord (Rimuru) said.</p><br/><p>\u300eI prepared thy food (body), come forth Demon.</p><br/><p>Be helpful and serve me!\u300f</p><br/><p>He grows excited every time he recalls it.</p><br/><p>He was summoned and named! He felt so intuitionally.</p><br/><p>He annihilated the small friesdemons who tried to steal the march, and then he put on a nonchalant look.</p><br/><p>And so, he obtained it.</p><br/><p>A new body and a Master who was worthy for him to pledge his allegiance to.</p><br/><p>That body adapted to him, the body transformed into one he wished for by liberally spending the saved magic power that he hadn\u2019t used before.</p><br/><p>In addition, his Master (Rimuru) had evolved into a true Demon Lord. He felt the influx of energy overflowing into him and replenishing the consumed magic power.</p><br/><p>And, the most decisive thing, he was given a name.</p><br/><p>The body that was made from magic power that had been saved up over a long time, the empty body was fully injected with magic power, and when he receives a name his form stabilized.</p><br/><p>For him, fighting meant trampling down the opponent.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t have any interest in strength. After all, it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t have any memory of having a hard fight.</p><br/><p>Even in fight against the Angel, it was just a massacre and a usual thing for him.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when the saved up magic power was completely consumed, he became a powerful person worthy to be called a Demon Duke.</p><br/><p>Even in the Demon world, there is no existence that is higher than him.</p><br/><p>Right now, he could stably use his experience that he had acquired over a very long time, he might really become an existence proportional to a True Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Even Diablo can\u2019t see the limit of his Master Rimuru.</p><br/><p>For the first time Diablo realized there is a sky above the sky.[1]</p><br/><p>And, for him that didn\u2019t have any interest in strength till now, Diablo also began to wish for strength after being inspired by his monster friends.</p><br/><p>1st place.</p><br/><p>That was a proof of being the highest among the monster subordinates of Demon Lord Rimuru.</p><br/><p>It was the proof of being the most useful and trusted person.</p><br/><p>What a sweet sound that titillated the mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy all costs, the seat of 1st rank must be mine.\u201d So Diablo thought.</p><br/><p>Shion who proposed the ranking, was defeated by him.</p><br/><p>But, he also admits Shion was the strongest oni, since she was his opponent for the semifinal.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not possible to let down his guard.</p><br/><p>(Kufufufufu. However, the one who win this is me!)</p><br/><p>While Diablo looks forward to the fight, he doesn\u2019t doubt his victory.</p><br/><p>\u300c.......Final match, Begin!!\u300d</p><br/><p>By Souka\u2019s signal, the final match began.</p><br/><p>Now all that's left is only to win against Benimaru with all his power.</p><br/><p>Diablo was not yet eager, but he released the power he carried in his body!</p><br/><p>Benimaru thought while observing Diablo.</p><br/><p>This demon.....is haphazard.</p><br/><p>There are many powerful, mutated people amongst Rimuru\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>But, only this Demon (Diablo) is special.</p><br/><p>In Benimaru\u2019s insight, if he and Shion fought directly, without doubt the winner would be Shion. So he thought. </p><br/><p>The reason is simple. Benimaru is suited for a group fight while Shion is cut out for individual fight. It\u2018s only that.</p><br/><p>Turning the same amount of energy for group attack into one target would increase the power.</p><br/><p>But even with such condition, he thought that Shion had more advantages in a one vs one battle.</p><br/><p>And yet, in front of Diablo, that Shion was defeated.</p><br/><p>It was a direct fight, yet she was overwhelmed.</p><br/><p>Benimaru thought that his chance to win in a straight forward fight is low.</p><br/><p>However.........</p><br/><p>\u300c......Begin!\u300d</p><br/><p>In response to Souka\u2019s yell, he distanced himself from Diablo in an instant.</p><br/><p>Tricks and lukewarm techniques are meaningless.</p><br/><p>The right choice is to challenge the opponent with the strongest skill with maximum power. That was the decision Benimaru took after watching the defeated Lion Mask\u2019s and Shion\u2019s battle, It was decided in the beginning! </p><br/><p>\u300cHell FlareBlack Flame Prison\u300d</p><br/><p>A black ball as big as a fist flies towards Diablo.</p><br/><p>There is no attempt from Diablo to avoid it, the formation of the magic circle is completed immediately, and a dome of 3m in diameter was formed with Diablo at its center.</p><br/><p>Unlike the one from before, it\u2019s loaded with enormous magic power. It was the successful compression of Hell Fire, which had an unparalleled power which cannot be resisted.</p><br/><p>Just like Benimaru, Diablo also has resistance against Natural Effects, but it\u2019s useless against the nullification attribute of the black flame.</p><br/><p>When the dome is completed, Benimaru\u2019s victory will be guaranteed, or at least that\u2019s what should happen.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. If I receive this attack straight ahead, it will be dangerous. Paradise</p><br/><p>Time (Time of Allurement)[2].\u300d</p><br/><p>Diablo\u2019s voice is heard and the surrounding time stops.</p><br/><p>Before he was thoroughly burnt by the dome of black flame, the movement of the magic power was stopped, and the generation of heat was obstructed.</p><br/><p>Though he only saw it for an instant, he fathomed the detail of the technique and its countermeasure.</p><br/><p>It was another effect of the Unique Skill\u300eGreat Wiseman[3]\u300f that Diablo possessed, for Diablo that had mastered this skill, skills that need long activation times are useless against him.</p><br/><p>This was surely the most dreadful aspect of he who had diligently mastered this ability.</p><br/><p>Also the reason why Diablo deliberately let himself received the attacks from his opponent, was only to reconfirm the result from his analytical appraisal.</p><br/><p>In case of some techniques, he could even steal it just by seeing it</p><br/><p>\u300cTch, just by looking, my technique was sealed......\u300d</p><br/><p>In the stopped world, Benimaru grumbled to Diablo.</p><br/><p>His first card is sealed, there is no anxiety in Benimaru while he thinking about the next plan.</p><br/><p>From the beginning, Diablo was in better position, because he had seen through one\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>But, even if they predict that they are equal in simple physical combat, if there is no winning move, it will be useless.</p><br/><p>Since there is physical attack nullification, a simple slash won\u2019t give any damage.</p><br/><p>Although it\u2019s possible with Aura Blade, its power is too weak to deal fatal damage to either of them.</p><br/><p>Rather, Benimaru predicted that he would lose if Diablo put his ability to use.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. Please stop being pretentious.</p><br/><p>You still have a trump card, right?</p><br/><p>You will die if you aren\u2019t really serious when receiving my technique, you know!\u300d</p><br/><p>Diablo began the movement to use the technique at the same time as he declared.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnd of World\u201d that surpassed Shion\u2019s Special Move, is a Super Special Move.[4]</p><br/><p>Benimaru judged that he had no time to think, and released a master swordsman art he had learned from Hakurou.</p><br/><p>\u201cDim Stream Slash\u201d. it's just like flowing water, warding everything and deflect it back at the opponent.</p><br/><p>Without being able to grasp its elegant simplicity, its effect will perplex the opponent, it is the pinnacle of sword arts.</p><br/><p>\u300cEnd of World!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDim Current Slash!!\u300d</p><br/><p>At the same time as End of World was cast, the time stopped by Paradise Time begins to flow.</p><br/><p>Receiving the aftereffects of End of World, an intense pain went through Benimaru\u2019s whole body.</p><br/><p>The energy that was unable to be warded off by \u201cDim Current Slash\u201d penetrated his whole body.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. You still got more. Or, do you give up?\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru was blown off and rolled over on the ground when the stopped time began to move again.</p><br/><p>Even though the sense of pain was nullified, his whole body was in pain, he noticed that this was a sign that his life was in danger.</p><br/><p>Diablo asks Benimaru with carefree tone, but Benimaru had no time to reply.</p><br/><p>Rather, to receive End of World inside of Paradise Time and still be capable of safely standing would be abnormal.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t care about such thoughts, Benimaru believed that he himself was worthless. </p><br/><p>His sword skill had improved so that he could now fight on par with Hakurou. His ability to concentrate magic power to use in combat had also increased and he could use it for various purposes.</p><br/><p>But.......Benimaru was inferior to Shion in Individual fights, he was also inferior to Ranga in Large-scale fights.</p><br/><p>In the end, he who specialized in commanding and seeing the whole picture, is he unable to transcend the wall of strength?</p><br/><p>That was the issue Benimaru faced.</p><br/><p>As the Army Commander, he was able to become useful for Rimuru. However, as he was right now, wasn\u2019t it impossible for him to become Rimuru\u2019 Shield?</p><br/><p>He was haunted by such anxiety.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why.........</p><br/><p>(Don\u2019t screw around with me. Why, there is a need for this great me[5] to be worried about such a small and unimportant thing!)</p><br/><p>He gradually became furious.</p><br/><p>Originally he held a short-tempered personality, he had become more mature and learned patience recently, but........ </p><br/><p>There is no way his initial personality can change so easily.</p><br/><p>As a Commander he held a sense of responsibility merely to make the aim of harmonious surroundings come to fruition.</p><br/><p>(To stop is foolish. It not like me, to worry repetitively is troublesome.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, I only need to win. If the opportunity is nonexistent then I\u2019ll just make one appear!)</p><br/><p>Benimaru made a breakthrough.</p><br/><p>Benimaru stood up and brandished his katana without answering Diablo\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Diablo who saw that appearance as the decision for the continuation of the fight, laughed lightly.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. It\u2019s Benimaru indeed!\u300d</p><br/><p>So he said as he took out a distorted blade, holding it with both hands.</p><br/><p>Its appearance is like three claws, it\u2019s symmetric.</p><br/><p>The length of one claw is about 1m, a sharp double-edged blade.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a special weapon made by Kurobee for Diablo, a ScissorsBladed Claw Scissors[6].</p><br/><p>Seeing Diablo who didn\u2019t use weapon before and letting out his personal weapon right now, a commotion arises inside the Colosseum.</p><br/><p>And, while anticipating something, they were engulfed by an intense enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>Benimaru discarded his hesitation, and had his mind focus.</p><br/><p>In the first place, there is a guy who improves greatly during a fight. If you say recently, it\u2019s Gobuta.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that Idiot can, there\u2019s no way I can\u2019t!\u201d is the simplest answer Benimaru came up with.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019ll do it. I will not let this bastard look down on my power...!!!!)</p><br/><p>And while calming his mind, a thick aura enclosed his whole body. He invoked the\u300eDemon Flame Transformation\u300f, the injury on his body is healed.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he fused the thick aura and the black flame into one.</p><br/><p>There are no ripples in it, a beautiful dark red aura covers his entire body and the preparation was complete.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t even take more than a second.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will become serious next. Don\u2019t resent me even if you die, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. Such confidence, I don\u2019t dislike it.\u300d</p><br/><p>Their gaze intersected, each one of them released the greatest technique they held.</p><br/><p>\u300cScissors of EndLife\u2019s Harvest![7]\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRebirthInterment Blast of Flamethe Hazy Black Flame!![8]\u300d</p><br/><p>Diablo\u2019s Scissors which reaps all lives, in a moment it clashed with Benimaru\u2019s Katana dyed in crimson, it was stopped and repelled back.</p><br/><p>When the Katana was retracted, a surge of black flame aura struck Diablo and slashed at him.</p><br/><p>Just like flowing water, it cannot be eluded, the flame wrapped up and thoroughly burned everything.</p><br/><p>Right now, produced at this moment was Benimaru\u2019s Special Move.</p><br/><p>Benimaru\u2019s Katana couldn\u2019t stand the heat and the impact so it broke and melted.</p><br/><p>Diablo\u2019s Scissors melted too because of the damage it received from Benimaru\u2019s Katana, and became something he couldn\u2019t use.</p><br/><p>Of course, Diablo who was wielding it also received a large wound on his chest and fell to the ground, defeated.</p><br/><p>\u300cKu, Kufufufufu....... Splendid. This is the first time in my lifethat I tasted defeat....... </p><br/><p>What is this? This bitterness. Never again do I want to taste such a thing......</p><br/><p>\u300cNever again? You..What do you think a fight is.....\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru fell to his knee as well, it seems like he had exhausted his spirit energy.</p><br/><p>\u300cE, eetto....... It\u2019s victory for Contestant Benimaru!!\u300d </p><br/><p>So Souka declared, at this moment, the winner was decided.</p><br/><p>It was a long tournament that lasted for several days. And so, the end arrived.</p><br/><p>[1]\u306b\u306f\u306e\u304c\u3044\u308b jou niwa jou no sonzai ga iru.

That was Beretta.</p><br/><p>Against Dino who used a weapon, it wouldn\u2019t mean that Beretta, who was weaponless, was at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>However, the offensive ability of Dino\u2019s weapon seemed to exceed Beretta\u2019s defensive ability.</p><br/><p>Thus, Dino moved light-heartedly to break the tension that ran between the two.</p><br/><p>Beretta skillfully warded off Dino\u2019s sword strike despite being unarmed.</p><br/><p>Without receiving the attacks headfirst, Beretta led Dino around with movements that fused both offense and defence.</p><br/><p>While Dino\u2019s attacks only came from the sword, Beretta\u2019s whole body was a weapon. Being unarmed didn\u2019t become a disadvantage - on the contrary, it enabled him to use many more methods of attacking.</p><br/><p>For Beretta, who was a Chaos Doll, attribute transformation was his forte.</p><br/><p>He drove the Holy attribute into the place that was adapted for Demonic attribute attacks. Thus, Dino\u2019s position was sealed off by Beretta\u2019s localized Holy Barrier for anti-individual use.</p><br/><p>He confronted Dino with calculated movements so that he obtained the advantage.</p><br/><p>But, Beretta\u2019s true state of affairs was a situation in which he barely maintained the current delicate operation similar to that of threading a needle.</p><br/><p>At any rate, the attribute attacks, both Holy and Demonic, didn\u2019t become a decisive blow.</p><br/><p>Dino is a Fallen Angel. He\u2019s originally an existence of the Holy attribute that shifted into the Demonic attribute, so he should be weak to Holy attribute.</p><br/><p>But for Dino, Holy and even Demonic are familiar attributes to him. Because of this, he had no weaknesses.</p><br/><p>Beretta was saved by the fact that Dino couldn\u2019t handle both attributes.</p><br/><p>Also, it\u2019s a situation where only a single blow of the fusion of both attributes by Beretta\u2019s Unique Skill\u300eHoly-Demonic Fusion\u300fcould somehow cause damage to him.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, even if it\u2019s only a sword strike, its single strike could cut Beretta easily.</p><br/><p>The strength of Adamantite became very helpless in front of God class weapons.</p><br/><p>At a glance, Beretta had continued the battle in an advantageous position but the situation could be immediately reversed with one incorrect move.</p><br/><p>Beretta, who understood this situation well, was devoting himself to stalling and buying time, as he wasn\u2019t fighting for victory.</p><br/><p>He understood that he couldn\u2019t win against Dino, but victory for him was not the defeat of his opponent.</p><br/><p>Certainly, It would\u2019ve been great for him to win, but true victory in this situation was the completion of his task of protecting Ramiris.</p><br/><p>As long as he could protect Ramiris, then even if he was defeated, it was possible for him to revive later.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Beretta placed priority in stalling for time above all else, and as such he chose the strategy that relied, potentially on sacrificing himself, meaning that he must never get impatient while dealing with Dino\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Dino, on the other hand, accurately saw through Beretta\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>However, saying that he\u2019d shatter it just because he saw through it, wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>What he only needed to be cautious of is the compound attack by\u300eHoly-Demonic Fusion\u300f.</p><br/><p>The aura that interweaved both holy attribute and demonic attribute which clad Beretta\u2019s body could attack and pierce through attribute defense.</p><br/><p>Basically, defending against this attack was impossible. He will certainly receive damage unless he exceeds it with his willpower and magic power.</p><br/><p>Although it\u2019s only a Unique Skill, it\u2019s wonderful because it could damage Dino, who possessed an Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>He should praise his - Beretta\u2019s - high offensive capabilities that were to the extent of being surprising.</p><br/><p>However, this ability had no use in defense.</p><br/><p>Because of his excessively-high defensive ability, he seems to be poor in self-defense technique.</p><br/><p>Currently Beretta is dealing well against Dino\u2019s attacks, but that was only because Dino was persistently cautious of receiving Beretta\u2019s strikes.</p><br/><p>In the case Dino shifted into attacking seriously, Beretta definitely would not have gotten off safely.</p><br/><p>Dino carefully ascertained that Beretta didn\u2019t have any hidden items.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s very troublesome but it\u2019s a necessary work for neutralizing Beretta in this place.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Beretta will revive immediately even if he\u2019s killed.</p><br/><p>It was what caused him to make the guardians of each labyrinth floor sleep.</p><br/><p>He could kill people if they weren\u2019t one of Ramiris\u2019 subordinates by destroying their \u2018Bracelet of Revival\u2019, but if her subordinates were killed then they would revive.</p><br/><p>A very troublesome ability that was given to Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Dino didn\u2019t defeat Ramiris\u2019 subordinates inside the labyrinth but instead, he neutralized them.It was necessary to kill Ramiris who was the foundation if such an opportunity arose.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s really troublesome. Even against Beretta alone takes this much of effort\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>By the way, at first Dino didn\u2019t grasp that the ceremony of evolution was held at the victory celebration party.</p><br/><p>By the request from Yuuki, he contacted Guy in the middle of the victory celebration party and schemed to cause a clash between him and Rimuru.</p><br/><p>And then he was watching the situation while hiding so that he didn\u2019t get involved in it.</p><br/><p>Everything was part of Yuuki\u2019s plan, so he was in the position to cooperate with it.</p><br/><p>The plan went well, and there was a sign that Guy seemed to begin to rampage. But, Guy open his heart. It became peaceful for some reason and he realized that the plan had failed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf things are going like this, even my spy conduct would\u2019ve gotten exposed,\u201d fortunately, dino had decided to withdraw at the right time\u2026...</p><br/><p>He noticed that the state inside the labyrinth was odd.</p><br/><p>It became quiet as if it had fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>It was his chance.</p><br/><p>For the sake of him serving that personage - the person lying dormant inside Yuuki - Ramiris\u2019 existence had become an obstacle.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t personally dislike Ramiris, but she who was living as she pleased like she\u2019d forgotten her original role became a dangerous existence to Dino\u2019s master.</p><br/><p>No, to be accurate it\u2019s not Ramiris who was dangerous\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s the labyrinth which she created that was far too dangerous.</p><br/><p>The labyrinth with many Devils rivaling the immortal Demon Lords living inside.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an impregnable place.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, a research of the latest technology that can be called the core of the lost civilization was conducted in the deepest part of the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Because an ordinary war potential invading it from the front to destroy the research facility was certainly unachievable.</p><br/><p>Thus, it was necessary to seal the labyrinth at any cost.</p><br/><p>The simplest way for it was to erase Ramiris. Dino decided that he had no time to be thinking about any other way.</p><br/><p>Yuuki had always regarded the labyrinth as dangerous.</p><br/><p>Also, Ramiris\u2019 ability.</p><br/><p>It could be said that when someone gets caught inside the labyrinth and the entrance is closed, escaping would be difficult.</p><br/><p>Ramiris\u2019\u300eLabyrinth Creation\u300fis a too dangerous ability, as it\u2019s a glimpse into the ability that created the world.</p><br/><p>Dino also agrees with this thought.</p><br/><p>Thus, he needs to kill Ramiris in this place.</p><br/><p>As he deprived the physical strength of the strong individuals in the labyrinth, they fell asleep quite easily.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s right now, there\u2019ll be no obstacles coming.</p><br/><p>He was a little sorry about killing Ramiris since she was a close friend, but even so, he had no hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u300cBeretta, you did well. Sleep now, \u201cFallen Hypno (Slothful Sleep)\u201d!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino, without hesitating, releases the now reusable ability of his Ultimate Skill[2].</p><br/><p>A strong hypnosis induction.</p><br/><p>Resisting it with willpower is useless. For those who need rest, they would certainly fall into an eternal sleep.</p><br/><p>It was the strongest of Dino\u2019s abilities that exerted a wide-range effect.</p><br/><p>Because Dino knew that it was meaningless even if he killed Beretta, he brought Beretta down with the effect of the ability.</p><br/><p>Similarly like him, even Ramiris who was being protected fell asleep under the influence of Dino\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously there are just too many strong people in this place. Really, what a pain...\u300d</p><br/><p>Confirming that Beretta has collapsed, Dino muttered so.</p><br/><p>He glanced at Ramiris who was sleeping soundly,</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, I didn\u2019t want to do a thing like this\u2026.. but I\u2019m not telling you to forgive me.</p><br/><p>Goodbye, Ramiris.\u300d</p><br/><p>(EN: sayonara is written in katakana here, for some reason. Maybe it\u2019s just there to make it more dramatic?)</p><br/><p>With a ruthless light in his eyes, Dino, without any hesitation, extended his hand towards Ramiris\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>A Demon is a race that doesn\u2019t need to sleep</p><br/><p>Therefore, Beretta had barely succeeded in resisting Dino\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>He protected Ramiris from Dino\u2019s spear hand that shone using his body as a shield.</p><br/><p>Dino\u2019s spear hand pierced through Beretta's Adamantite body with ease.</p><br/><p>He seems to not care about Beretta\u2019s defense power as currently he\u2019s not clad in defense of magic power.</p><br/><p>Rather saying he succeeded in resisting the ability, he simply doesn\u2019t need sleep.</p><br/><p>He forcibly make Beretta entered Sleep Mode and Beretta already has no combat ability.</p><br/><p>But,</p><br/><p>\u300cFu, fufufu. I purposely let my core be destroyed. As a result, now I\u2019ll die and revive flawlessly.</p><br/><p>It still not the end yet, Dino. I will not let you kill my master!\u300d </p><br/><p>Beretta\u2019s voice didn\u2019t have any sign of despair and was convinced with their victory.</p><br/><p>\u300cFool. During the little time until you revive, there\u2019s no obstacle for me to kill Ramiris!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino shouted, denying Beretta\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>However, Beretta\u2019s confidence was proper.</p><br/><p>While he stalling to buy some time, the situation had improved for the better.</p><br/><p>Rather than, in this first place inside this labyrinth\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I will not let you do it.</p><br/><p>This \u201cGehenna Lord (Dark Soul Lord)\u201d Adalman will be your opponent!\u300d</p><br/><p>One man\u2015\u2015 No, one skeleton entered the Research Room as if responding to Dino\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u300cI request you to delay him, Adalman.\u300d</p><br/><p>As Beretta called out to him with trust, he became light particles and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Adalman gave a big nod and began taking over the fight.</p><br/><p>Inside the labyrinth, a second battle had begun.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>He really was really getting fed up with this.</p><br/><p>That was not Dino\u2019s fake impression.</p><br/><p>Even Adalman isn\u2019t a threat for Dino. However, without destroying his \u201cBracelet of Revival\u201d, Adalman cannot be killed completely.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, from Adalman\u2019s side, being able to stall for some time against Dino, who was of a higher rank, was already enough.</p><br/><p>Not to mention,</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you have time to be looking away right now?\u300d</p><br/><p>A voice is heard, and a sharp slash grazes Dino\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s Albert\u2019s - who appeared after Adalman - sword.</p><br/><p>A single strike with a God class weapon from Albert, who was a top swordsman.</p><br/><p>Albert didn't seem to have mastered the armor yet, and it\u2019s certain that Dino is advantageous yet\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Attacks towards Adalman were tanked by the two people - Albert and the revived Beretta.</p><br/><p>And then, the attacks of those two reached Dino with the aid of Recovery Magic in the powerful Support Magic category.</p><br/><p>Magic doesn\u2019t affect a person who possesses a Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>In a sense, this was the natural result because Ultimate Skills are of a higher rank of magic. But, it\u2019s effective even if it only gives an indirect effect rather than a direct one.</p><br/><p>In other words, weakening magic and the like wouldn\u2019t work, but giving support to an ally vanguard was effective.</p><br/><p>And in addition to that, it\u2019s the compound effect of\u3008Undead Magic\u3009with\u3008Divine Magic\u3009of Adalman who was a top Grand Priest Class.</p><br/><p>Beretta had been able to show the ability that exceeded this a while ago, Albert is also in his top condition.</p><br/><p>The exchange of super special moves by the two vanguards who can damage even a spiritual life-form.</p><br/><p>Regarding the special sleep, it didn\u2019t have effect as Undead and Demon didn\u2019t need sleep.</p><br/><p>He, who should have been at an overwhelmingly higher rank, was having a hard fight against 3 people with lower ranks than him, which was causing him to lose his confidence\u2026\u2026 \u201cHave I weakened because of my lazy habit for a long time?\u201d.</p><br/><p>Though it could be said that Dino still had composure, being able to think about such joking thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up! And yet you two people came to attack the weak me, don\u2019t say it so proudly!</p><br/><p>Damn it! Besides, why? The timing was too good, you know!?\u300d</p><br/><p>This was too much for Dino, the timing when Adalman appeared was too perfect.</p><br/><p>It was unnatural for Adalman to appear immediately after Dino had used his ranged attack that was \u201cFallen Hypno\u201d.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s like the coming of that attack had been predicted since the beginning\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(No, as expected I\u2019m over thinking it\u2026..)</p><br/><p>He denied his own thought, and finished dealing with the attack of those two vanguards.</p><br/><p>Dino is also a high level swordsman that equalled Albert in sword technique, who possessed a Super-Special Move.</p><br/><p>However, he is able to fight evenly because of his physical ability rather than his techniques.</p><br/><p>Because Dino\u2019s\u300eSlothful King Belphegor\u300fhad a special ability of increasing his power if he didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>If you say it plainly, he could basically increase his energy by saving his energy.</p><br/><p>Though there\u2019s a limit to the maximum amount that he could let out at a time, he could arbitrarily use it in the Hyper Mode to go beyond his usual state.</p><br/><p>With that ability, Dino can get a temporary overwhelming fighting power.</p><br/><p>Therefore, because he still had surplus of power, he must ascertain the most efficient way to kill the 3 people in front of him\u2026..\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cFuu, fuhahahahaha! I\u2019m happy I\u2019m happy. It might be not a problem even if I inform you.</p><br/><p>You were observed you know.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s only natural right? Have you thought about the place you are in right now?</p><br/><p>After all, it\u2019s the territory of the Great Demon Lord Rimuru-sama. You cannot do whatever you please.</p><br/><p>Of course, this battle is being observed (monitored) too\u300d</p><br/><p>Adalman informed Dino totally as if what he said was a known fact.</p><br/><p>No, if he gave it more thought he, too, would agree.</p><br/><p>Even Dino could see that Demon Lord Rimuru possessed fearsome ingenuity, enough to set up this deeply laid plan. </p><br/><p>If that was the case, even if they succeeded in resisting \u201cFallen Hypno\u201d at first, they would not immediately come over, he might need to be cautious about re-using it.</p><br/><p>Since Dino knew that they would revive even if he had killed them, it was expected that he would surely aim to neutralize them with a sleeping attack.</p><br/><p>And if they grasped the time for its reuse, he would have no effective means to completely silence them.</p><br/><p>Above all else\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(This, me\u2026.. the \u201cObserver\u201d, is being observed, he said!?)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015that was humiliating.</p><br/><p>It stimulated Dino\u2019s pride, who originally lazy in nature, and Adaman succeeded in making Dino angry.</p><br/><p>It was a rule for Dino to achieve the biggest result with a little effort, therefore he avoided the use of an ability that consumed energy needlessly.</p><br/><p>But, it doesn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>(It might be good if I end it quickly!)</p><br/><p>Dino releases all his power in anger, his unwilling nature had disappeared.</p><br/><p>He made the biggest mistake by failing to realise who was truly being observed and as such, he cannot let the people who know this information live.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s troublesome, but I cannot say so either.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think badly about me! \u201cFallen Catastrophe (Temptation towards Destruction)\u201d!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The law is rewritten, and the positive factor starts reverting to minus.</p><br/><p>Energy that lead to the suspension of activity, regardless of being living or undead. However, since there was no compelling force, it was the target of the technique who voluntarily walked on the road to destruction.</p><br/><p>It can be seen as a kind of hypnotism, but the effect caused by this ability was on a different level.</p><br/><p>Because everyone who failed in resisting this will surely die.</p><br/><p>The point of the inducement this time was \u201cDestruction\u201d, but Dino could make the target conduct a specific result with the hypnosis. It was a versatile ability.</p><br/><p>Because it didn\u2019t use sound as medium, a barrier or the like can\u2019t defend against it which may be its notable point.</p><br/><p>As one of the seven deadly sins, \u201cSloth\u201d could also be called one of the most dreadful ultimate abilities..</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because it\u2019s an ability that could exert absolute control over people with emotion and intelligence.. </p><br/><p>Due to the activation of Dino\u2019s ability, everyone who was in this place fell down and their deaths were confirmed.</p><br/><p>Dino had a harder time than he thought.</p><br/><p>They were existences that hadn\u2019t acquired Ultimate Skills yet, nevertheless he shuddered at the fact that they were only the subordinates of a sole Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>To be precise, Beretta holds two position as he was Ramiris\u2019 subordinate, but such a thing was an irrelevant point.</p><br/><p>(Really\u2026\u2026 they were not the highest ranking people among Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s subordinates, right?)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a justified point that Dino wants to complain.</p><br/><p>According to Dino\u2019s opinion, his opponents now could be the key figures amongst Rimuru\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>But after battling Albert and others, it seems that he ought to make an upward adjustment in his evaluation.</p><br/><p>Since it had became a state of emergency, the high rank group had been dispatched. Among the remaining high ranked people, he had confirmed that Benimaru had went elsewhere.</p><br/><p>The only remaining threat for Dino was Shion, but she hadn\u2019t awakened an Ultimate Skill yet.</p><br/><p>He was extremely cautious and, after confirming the situation, it seemed to be a correct answer for him to wait until the last minute when the success rate increased.</p><br/><p>Because if Benimaru, Shion and Souei had also participated in the fight with the three that he had just defeated, the situation would\u2019ve become more difficult even if he didn\u2019t lose.</p><br/><p>Being relieved for the time being, Dino stretched out his hand and towards Ramiris\u2019 corpse in order to confirm the result.</p><br/><p>\u201cFallen Catastrophe\u201d is an ability that scattered a wave of hypnosis inducement to the surroundings, so there\u2019s no escape from it.</p><br/><p>The effect is shown if the target is basked in it, even in sleeping state. Rather, the target would die without being able to resist it in their sleep.</p><br/><p>Dino was convinced of Ramiris\u2019 death and touched the body.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 He touched it (the corpse), or what it should\u2019ve been.</p><br/><p>The corpse turned into light particles, as it took the shape of a butterfly and flew around Dino\u2019s surroundings.</p><br/><p>As if it was sneering at Dino\u2026\u2026 </p><br/><p>(\u2015\u2015No way\u2026\u2026 it was an illusion!?)</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t want to believe it as it was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>But\u2026\u2026 surely, Adalman had said so.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis battle is being observed too\u201d.</p><br/><p>(Was that a provocation? In order to make me use my trump card\u2026\u2026!?)</p><br/><p>So, when he thought about it, it was unnatural for Adalman to say that remark there even though it didn\u2019t create an advantage against Dino.</p><br/><p>But, even if it could create an advantageous situation, it wasn\u2019t something that he could understand.</p><br/><p>In other words\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Thunk, thunk\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Slowly, someone's footsteps were heard.</p><br/><p>The beautiful butterfly of light flew, as if dancing, towards the person who walked calmly and touched that person\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>And the butterfly returns to the form of a fairy sleeping adorably\u2026\u2026 Ramiris, who slept innocently and seemingly happily.</p><br/><p>Ramiris was handed over to a man with blackish blue hair beside the hand\u2019s owner, who stood without any presence and before anyone was aware of him,</p><br/><p>\u300cSouei-dono, I leave Ramiris-sama to you\u300d</p><br/><p>A man said it calmly.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, leave it to me. Support?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no need. I alone is enough\u300d</p><br/><p>From the beginning, defense for Ramiris was conducted perfectly.</p><br/><p>In the safest labyrinth depths, multiple layers of trap were set up.</p><br/><p>By the instructions of a certain person, they were ordered to fight minimally in order to strip the ability of the person who come as a spy.</p><br/><p>They followed the order faithfully.</p><br/><p>The only one who didn\u2019t know about this was Ramiris. </p><br/><p>And, now\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>The strongest existence inside the labyrinth had begun to move.</p><br/><p>It had engulfed itself in a cocoon in order to evolve its ability, but its consciousness had always been awake.</p><br/><p>It was always paying attention due to Thought Link, and it completely grasped the situation.</p><br/><p>Due to its blessing of overwhelming, absolute defense, Ramiris\u2019 safety was ensured.</p><br/><p>Inside the labyrinth, the third fight began.</p><br/><p>Standing in front of Dino was the \u201cMist Lord (Phantasmal Lord)\u201d Zegion.</p><br/><p>He who was the strongest being in this labyrinth. </p><br/><p>[1] Beretta\u2019s body.

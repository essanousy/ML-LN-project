You\u2019re pointless.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Empowerment Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 09 \u2013 Negotiating with the Goblins</p><br/><p>I glanced at the goblin.</p><br/><p>The goblins are, from what I can see, pretty desperate. They are on guard, weapon in hand; and are politely calling out to me.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, many seem to have run away already.</p><br/><p>But as expected of the leader,</p><br/><p>He looks me straight in the eye\u2026 err, straight at me.</p><br/><p>Alright.</p><br/><p>I feel some intelligence from this one. Might be able to talk properly.</p><br/><p>Will my voice reach..?</p><br/><p>I tried attaching thought to the spoken words and sending them to goblin.</p><br/><p>\u300cShould I say, pleased to meet you? I am the slime, Rimuru.\u300d</p><br/><p>The goblins began murmuring among themselves.</p><br/><p>Were they surprised that a slime spoke? Or so I thought, but\u2026</p><br/><p>Among them, a few wearing plain clothing threw away their weapons.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t really get it.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuga, O strong one! We very understand your great power! We beg, lower your voice!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Mu? Were the thoughts I attached too strong?</p><br/><p>So I guess telepathy is a no go. They\u2019d just be more afraid.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy bad. I still can\u2019t regulate it very well.\u300d</p><br/><p>I guess I\u2019ll apologize.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe unworthy. No need apologize to us!\u300d</p><br/><p>Seems like my words are reaching them.</p><br/><p>This is some good practice.</p><br/><p>Oh and by the way, I\u2019m speaking Japanese, yet somehow, they are understanding.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, what do you need from me? I don\u2019t have any particular reason to be going this way, either.\u300d</p><br/><p>Since they have politely asked questions, I guess I\u2019ll politely answer.</p><br/><p>And maybe it was too much, but to make sure they continued fearing me, I said that rather forcefully.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo it like that. On this path, stand our village. We felt strong monster, so came as precaution.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA strong monster\u2019s presence? One that I have not detected..?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGuga, gugaga, you joke! Even clothed in that form, we will not be fooled!\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems like they\u2019ve completely got the wrong idea. (Warning! The one who\u2019s mistaken is Rimuru!)</p><br/><p>They are completely convinced that a powerful monster took the shape of a slime.</p><br/><p>As would be expected from goblins, who are famous for being low ranking monsters.</p><br/><p>After talking to the goblins for a while, it seems like I\u2019ll be imposing on their village.</p><br/><p>That is, it seems like I\u2019m staying over.</p><br/><p>Though they look shabby, it seems they have a big heart.</p><br/><p>And though I don\u2019t need to sleep, taking a break might be a good idea.</p><br/><p>With that thought, I decided to accept the offer and go to their village.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>We discussed many things.</p><br/><p>That, the god they worshiped had recently disappeared.</p><br/><p>That, along with his disappearance, various monsters begun moving.</p><br/><p>That, the number of powerful adventurers had increased.</p><br/><p>And so on.</p><br/><p>And, during the conversation, I finally became able to clearly hear their words.</p><br/><p>That I can probably attribute to having gotten used to listening with [Magic Perception].</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably a good thing I practiced with goblins before talking to people.</p><br/><p>Such was the conversation in the company of goblins.</p><br/><p>The village is\u2026 where? Is what I wanted to say, considering how dirty it was.</p><br/><p>After all, I hadn\u2019t expected goblin dig up their dens.</p><br/><p>Even so, they guided me to the best looking building.</p><br/><p>The roof was made of rotting straw, and so was full of holes; the walls were just piled plywood\u2026</p><br/><p>By my world\u2019s standards, even slum housing is preferable! That\u2019s how bad it was.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe apologize for making you wait, honored guest.\u300d</p><br/><p>A goblin said while entering the structure.</p><br/><p>The goblin leader who had been showing me around until now then moved to attend to this one.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh\u2026 don\u2019t mind it. I hadn\u2019t been waiting that long\u300d</p><br/><p>I tried to respond with the best business-like smile I could foster.</p><br/><p>Of course, the best slime-smile possible.</p><br/><p>They say that a single smile can turn negotiation in one\u2019s favor. Got to say, even I am susceptible to that skill.</p><br/><p>Not that I know what we are negotiating about..</p><br/><p>\u300cWe humbly apologize for the inability to provide better accommodations. I currently have the pleasure of serving as this village\u2019s chief.\u300d</p><br/><p>Having said that, the goblins placed before me a tea-like drink.</p><br/><p>Which I have to admit, was rather surprising.</p><br/><p>I sip the tea. (To the onlookers, it probably looked like I toppled the cup over.)</p><br/><p>It had no taste. Which was obvious, considering I had no taste buds.</p><br/><p>Whether that was good thing or not\u2013I don\u2019t know\u2026 after checking the ingredients, I confirmed that it was not poisonous.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I could feel their sincere attempt at hospitality from this cup.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, for what reason have you gone out of your way to invite me here?\u300d</p><br/><p>I went straight to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s become friends with a fellow monster!\u201d \u2026 it probably wasn\u2019t that kind of benevolent reason.</p><br/><p>Although the chief tensed and began to tremble, he seemed to have steeled himself and proceeded to ask.</p><br/><p>And this is what he said,</p><br/><p>\u300cIf I may, you are aware of the recent increase in activity among the monsters, correct?\u300d</p><br/><p>That I heard on the way here.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe have lived till now peacefully due to the protection from our god; however, He seems to have hidden himself about a month ago\u2026</p><br/><p>Due to his disappearance, the nearby monsters have begun invading these lands\u2026</p><br/><p>We, ourselves, did not welcome their incursion, and responded with force; but, our forces\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmmmm.</p><br/><p>Would the god be\u2026 Veldora? Fits time wise\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, it seems the goblins want my help.</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand your request. However, being a slime, I doubt I can live up to your expectations.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, how modest! A slime could never radiate such strong demonic aura!</p><br/><p>We are not so presumptuous as to try guess at why you have taken that appearance, but we are aware\u2013you are a Named Monster, are you not?\u300d</p><br/><p>Demonic aura\u2026 he said?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that? I don\u2019t remember emitting that\u2026</p><br/><p>So, I tried to observe myself with [Magic Perception].</p><br/><p>There was some kind of ominous aura drifting about me.</p><br/><p>Ugh\u2026 I should have noticed it when mimicking monsters or trying out [Body Armor]\u2026</p><br/><p>How embarrassing\u2026.</p><br/><p>This feels just like walking down main street with your fly wide open.</p><br/><p>The cave\u2019s high magical energy concentration probably confused my senses.</p><br/><p>But, this is no good! Totally out of the question!</p><br/><p>Now, I finally understand the monsters\u2019 fear of me\u2026</p><br/><p>What monster would want to make an enemy of this dangerous looking guy?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idiots getting fooled by appearance here!\u201d kind of thing.</p><br/><p>Welp\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu. As expected of the chief, thou understands?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was obvious, your grace! Your wondrous persona cannot be hidden!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, I was found out. Thou seems to be a promising bunch.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m getting carried away, aren\u2019t I.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s play along with their misconceptions and manipulate them a bit.</p><br/><p>At the same time, let\u2019s try to erase that ominous aura (demonic aura).</p><br/><p>As if absorbing the aura, I tried to direct the outer magical energy inside.</p><br/><p>\u300cOoh! You have been testing us! And let us thank you. There were many who feared your great aura.\u300d</p><br/><p>Looks like the aura successfully dissipated.</p><br/><p>From what I can see, I now look just like a normal slime.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>Had I been wandering around as a normal slime\u2026</p><br/><p>I probably would have been annoyed with all the fights by now\u2026</p><br/><p>So isn\u2019t this aura a good thing?</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is so! Having beheld my aura and yet spake before I, wonderfully done!\u300d</p><br/><p>(TL Note: spake is an archaic (traditional) form of spoke, just imagine Rimuru speaking like Veldora)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s wonderful about it\u2026? Am I looking for trouble? Well, I\u2019ll bear with it for now.</p><br/><p>Like an actor,</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! Your kindness is wasted on us. If You will, we shall not inquire regarding Your true visage. Lest You anger, we wish for you to hearken to our request. Could we hope for such a favor?\u300d</p><br/><p>(TL Note: hearken is archaic for listen, imagine the goblins being groveling-level polite)</p><br/><p>Well, probably.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t avoid the subject. Let me hear it!\u300d</p><br/><p>While maintaining my haughty attitude, I pressed the chief for details.</p><br/><p>The story goes as thus.</p><br/><p>Coming from the eastern lands, new monsters threaten the balance of this region.</p><br/><p>Further, it seems that there are a few goblin villages around here.</p><br/><p>This village being but one of them, but they have had many battles with the newcomers and lost many good warriors.</p><br/><p>But the real problem was the named warrior.</p><br/><p>He served as the guardian of this village; and, when he was lost, the village found itself in a perilous situation.</p><br/><p>Other goblin communities have abandoned it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile the newcomers ravage that village, we\u2019ll come up with a plan!\u201d So the other villages thought.</p><br/><p>And no matter how much the Goblin Chief and Leader begged them, they were coldly rebuked.</p><br/><p>Such is the bitter story the goblins conveyed.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026 how many live in this village? Among those, how many can fight?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, there are a hundred denizens. If we include females, sixty are able to fight\u300d</p><br/><p>Sounds rather unreliable.</p><br/><p>However, to even comprehend basic mathematics\u2026 the goblins are rather intelligent.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. What about the opponent? How many and of what race? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes. From the wolf species, the Fang Wolf family. At the moment, even ten of us could hardly match one of them\u2026</p><br/><p>And there are a hundred of them\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Ha..? Who set this to game to Impossible difficulty?!</p><br/><p>I stared the chief in the eyes.</p><br/><p>No, he is not lying. His eyes are earnest.</p><br/><p>There are few dubious points, but I can probably believe his words for the most part.</p><br/><p>\u300cAbout those goblin warriors. They knew they couldn\u2019t win and still threw their lives away pointlessly?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 No, this intel is the product of the lives they gave away.\u300d</p><br/><p>His next words made me regret my question.</p><br/><p>Named Goblin was the Chief\u2019s son, and Goblin Leader\u2019s older brother.</p><br/><p>Having heard the situation, I stopped to think.</p><br/><p>Without a word, the Chief awaits my decision.</p><br/><p>Did I just see a tear in his eyes? \u2026 probably just imagined it.</p><br/><p>Tears don\u2019t suit monsters.</p><br/><p>Arrogance does. That\u2019s the proper appearance of the feared monsters.</p><br/><p>\u300cChief, there is but one thing I wish to confirm. If I save this village, what be my reward? What will thee do for me?\u300d</p><br/><p>Not that I wouldn\u2019t do this without a reward.</p><br/><p>But, we\u2019re talking about a hundred enemies as strong as ten goblins each.</p><br/><p>This will be no walk in the park.</p><br/><p>If I mimic the black serpent I can probably manage, but\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not a deal I can just easily accept.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe offer our loyalty! Please protect us. If You do, we shall forever serve You!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Honestly, I can do without their loyalty.</p><br/><p>But, having endured 90 days of solitude, I truly enjoyed talking with the goblins.</p><br/><p>Had I been human, I might have been repulsed by their filthiness.</p><br/><p>But, I am now a monster. I fear no disease.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the chief\u2019s eyes. I\u2019m their only hope, they say.</p><br/><p>Just like in the past world, I\u2019m weak to dependent types.</p><br/><p>While grumbling to myself, listening to complains from my kouhai, and fulfilling the requests of customers and senpai\u2026</p><br/><p>(TL Note: kouhai is a member of an organization who started there after the person in question, senpai is person who was there before)</p><br/><p>\u300cVery well! I shall accept that request!\u300d</p><br/><p>I accepted with an exaggerated bow.</p><br/><p>And so, I became the master of goblins, and their guardian.</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: the Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Titles: None</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Skills: Unique Skill [Great Sage], Unique Skill [Predator], Slime-Specific Skills [Dissolve, Absorb, Regenerate], Extra Skill [Water Manipulation], Extra Skill [Magic Perception], Acquired Skills: Black Serpent [Heat Detection, Noxious Breath], Centipede [Paralysis Breath], Spider [Sticky Thread, Steel Threat], Bat [Ultrasound Waves], Lizard [Body Armor]</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance EX, Physical Attack Resistance, Pain Resistance, Electricity Resistance, Paralysis Resistance</p><br/>\n</div>"}

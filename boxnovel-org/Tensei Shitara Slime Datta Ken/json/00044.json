We also need to set up some temporary housing for the newcomers.</p><br/><p>After I sent him back, I sat down to decide who\u2019d rush back with me.</p><br/><p>Ranga can carry two back and Star Leader can carry another\u2026</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t come to a consensus on who\u2019d go.</p><br/><p>Shion said, \u201cI\u2019m in charge of our lord\u2019s care!\u201d, and Benimaru mentioned something about defenses or what-not.</p><br/><p>Gerudo also referred to his ability to carry things with his stomach, and asked to be included.</p><br/><p>Honestly, though, I don\u2019t care who goes.</p><br/><p>Wait a second! I just remembered that I can use \u300eShadow Step\u300fas well.</p><br/><p>After I decided to return this way, the debate suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>I was completely oblivious to dejected Ranga, who wanted to carry me, and disappointed Shion, who was hoping to ride with me.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I\u2019ll be going on ahead!\u300d</p><br/><p>I declared, and left using\u300eShadow Step\u300f.</p><br/><p>Daaamn, this skill is convenient! It\u2019s like moving straight to the target through a different dimension.</p><br/><p>Oh, and I fly through that plain using \u3008Flight Magic\u3009.</p><br/><p>Feels like I\u2019m moving really, really fast. In a blink of an eye I reach the city.</p><br/><p>Seems like this skill can plot a course not just to people and monsters, but also to locations I\u2019ve previously visited.</p><br/><p>I still can\u2019t fly especially fast using\u3008Flight Magic\u3009. However, even at current speed, I can easily conclude that this is the best way to travel.</p><br/><p>I am completely satisfied with the results of this trial run.</p><br/><p>Ranga\u2019s group will probably arrive within 2~3 days.</p><br/><p>Hakurou and the High Orcs will be here a month from now, at the soonest.</p><br/><p>So before they arrive, I have to prepare a place for them to live.</p><br/><p>While some small dilemmas are bound to arise, we\u2019ve at least solved all the major problems.</p><br/><p>For now, I just want to relax.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Then,</p><br/><p>After everyone arrived on time and I divided up the responsibilities, things quieted down.</p><br/><p>The city was quickly taking on shape.</p><br/><p>The high orcs, who arrived in less than a month, quickly learned the appropriate skills from the Dwarfs and skilled Goblins.</p><br/><p>According to Kaijin,</p><br/><p>\u300cWith time, they just might become as good as the Dwarf Manufacturing Battalion.\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what he said.</p><br/><p>Thus, having acquired new workers, we quickly rushed to finish all the previously neglected projects.</p><br/><p>At the same time, we started transporting goods and equipment.</p><br/><p>We dismantled the tents that were no longer in use, and sent them to the orc communities.</p><br/><p>The goblins sent to them have been able to assert their leadership and have been helping establishing basic necessities.</p><br/><p>The moment we began exchanging goods we also started establishing a solid system of exchange.</p><br/><p>Though they ended up with, what we may call ancient, bartering system, the fact that they came up with it is in itself wonderful.</p><br/><p>Besides, it\u2019s not like they are growing that many goods yet, so they can take all the time they need to learn these things.</p><br/><p>There is very little variety right now; basically limited to growing a potato-like crop.</p><br/><p>It can grow even in harsh environments.</p><br/><p>It also has high nutritional value, and though you can\u2019t exactly call it luxury food you can certainly live off of it.</p><br/><p>Thus, we spread the seeds among them and taught them how to grow it.</p><br/><p>Perhaps in two years they could be self-sufficient? I surely hoped so\u2026</p><br/><p>Gerudo was very useful in transporting the seeds and tents.</p><br/><p>As he claimed he could, he swallowed the disassembled tents and thus distributed them among the villages.</p><br/><p>However, his success is largely thanks to the fact that he can now leap along with the star wolves during \u300eShadow Step\u300f.</p><br/><p>He seriously tried hard to learn it and became the first to succeed with it.</p><br/><p>The rest went smoothly.</p><br/><p>That is, the trip to the mountain district alone on foot would have taken him many months. Instead, he was able to make a round trip in a single day.</p><br/><p>So we decided to put the skill to use and established a communications network between all the villages.</p><br/><p>Basically\u2013Postal Service.</p><br/><p>For example, I can scribble some information on a wood block and have it circulated among the communities.</p><br/><p>Though I must mention that only a few individuals here can read and write, and I\u2019m rather afraid of sending a verbal message.</p><br/><p>Who knows that it will become after being passed from village to village.</p><br/><p>Hopefully they can learn letters. More so, since \u300eTelepathic Communication\u300f does not reach that far.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s for later.</p><br/><p>Thus, we were able to establish some kind of connection between the many communities.</p><br/><p>And I must not forget about a guy that showed up.</p><br/><p>Gabil.</p><br/><p>That idiot suddenly showed up in our city.</p><br/><p>\u300cIyaa\u2026 ha ha ha! This Gabil has rushed over to become Your strength, Rimuru-dono!\u300d</p><br/><p>He brazenly stated.</p><br/><p>\u300cKill him?\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion asked me with a serious face.</p><br/><p>The kind of face that screams \u201cserious!\u201d and reads \u201cabsolutely serious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gabil paled and,</p><br/><p>\u300cI got carried away! I\u2019m sorry!</p><br/><p>Please allow us to become Your subordinates, Rimuru-sama!</p><br/><p>We will definitely prove ourselves useful!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He immediately corrected himself falling into a dogeza.</p><br/><p>Apparently, he was disowned (exiled?) by his father, and had no place to go.</p><br/><p>So since he was just so pitiful, I decided to welcome him in.</p><br/><p>Bet he\u2019ll get carried away again right away, though.</p><br/><p>Hmm? If I look closely, seems like the Head\u2019s Guard Captain is also among them.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Captain-san, why are you here?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I asked him,</p><br/><p>\u300cI came to serve Souei-sama, whom I greatly admire!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? So you didn\u2019t come because you admired this Gabil!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI am different from the other muscle brains! That much is obvious!\u300d</p><br/><p>They started to quarrel among themselves.</p><br/><p>The majority, it seems, came out of respect for Gabil, but there were a few from the guard squad as well.</p><br/><p>Well, I don\u2019t see a big problem with them wanting to serve Souei.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you want to serve Souei, go and talk to him. But do note\u2013he\u2019s a ninja. Will you be of any use to him? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe shall! We are different from those naive idiots!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWh-what did you say! Don\u2019t underestimate me, little girl!\u300d</p><br/><p>Seems like they don\u2019t get along.</p><br/><p>Probably the fact that one started a rebellion and the other captured them afterwards led to a grudge forming between them. In any case, I won\u2019t meddle in that.</p><br/><p>Cause it\u2019s damn tiresome.</p><br/><p>Oh, and I later learned that the little girl is Gabil\u2019s younger sister.</p><br/><p>Since she\u2019s his relative, she\u2019s probably also little weird.</p><br/><p>But her father is a wonderful guy\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, since you\u2019ll be serving Souei, I guess you\u2019ll be called Souka.</p><br/><p>The other four I\u2019ll name,</p><br/><p>Touka, Saika, Nansou, and Hokusou!\u300d</p><br/><p>Flower endings for girls, and spear endings for boys. Of course, there is no greater meaning attached.</p><br/><p>These five served in the Guard Squad. I\u2019ll leave them to Souei.</p><br/><p>The moment I named them, they began to evolve.</p><br/><p>Gabil observed this with great envy.</p><br/><p>However, I cannot name Gabil. He already has a name.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you jealous, Gabil-kun?</p><br/><p>But you are already named \u201cGabil!\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>Gabil quickly looked at me.</p><br/><p>And then, his body began to glow. Hmm? That\u2019s a sign of evolution\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment I thought that, a lot of magical energy suddenly left my body.</p><br/><p>Again?!</p><br/><p>Seriously\u2026 But who could have thought I can overwrite names.</p><br/><p>Well, chances are this happened by pure chance. The one who named him had died, and we were on the same wavelength or something like that? I don\u2019t know exactly why it happened, but the fact remains: I (re)named Gabil.</p><br/><p>I had wanted him to reflect a bit more, but just thinking how haughty he\u2019ll become after evolving\u2026 damn it, now I\u2019m scared!</p><br/><p>While thinking these things, I entered Sleep Mode.</p><br/><p>The following day, I named the other hundred lizardmen soldiers.</p><br/><p>The names I assigned by picking letters of the alphabet.</p><br/><p>20 names was my limit. Since they were high level monsters to begin with, naming them takes uses up a lot of magical energy.</p><br/><p>The whole process took five days.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t I just stop?</p><br/><p>Somehow, I feel like I\u2019m working harder than I ever did in my past life.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s Gabil. It\u2019s all Gabil\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>Since that\u2019s clearly the truth, let\u2019s fire a magic bullet at him.</p><br/><p>\u300cWh-what are you doing?!\u300d</p><br/><p>He exclaimed in surprise,</p><br/><p>\u300cPractice!\u300d</p><br/><p>I responded.</p><br/><p>He happily accepted that response. He really is an idiot. One that can compete with Gobuta.</p><br/><p>By the way, since it was pointless, I didn\u2019t fire a bullet at him.</p><br/><p>Gabil evolved into a Dragonewt.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s covered by dense scales which act like a multi-layer barrier.</p><br/><p>Oh and speaking of strange, the appearance of dragonewts varries by gender.</p><br/><p>The men don\u2019t look much different than when they were lizardmen. They sprouted dragon wings and horns, and are now covered in hard scales\u2013just that much.</p><br/><p>Well, their dark-green color also changed to dark-purple.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the women have a human appearance. Rather beautiful, actually.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they can also cover themselves with dragon scales, sprout wings and horns at will.</p><br/><p>They look like I would if I were to transform into a human and combine myself with the black snake and giant bat.</p><br/><p>Perhaps that black snake was a dragon species.</p><br/><p>So, since Gabil\u2019s vices annoyed me to no end, I also wanted to check out his defenses, and it\u2019s hard to check that by yourself, I fired a test shot at him. He was unharmed.</p><br/><p>I only shot a normal round, that he normally received\u2026 that should have been five times stronger than usual\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, maybe he\u2019s just so stupid he doesn\u2019t feel the pain, or, even worse, he inherited my pain resistance.</p><br/><p>They do say that dinosaurs were dull to pain, so could he be a\u2026</p><br/><p>Now that they have evolved, what should we do about their housing?</p><br/><p>If they need water, there\u2019s that river flowing nearby\u2026</p><br/><p>And it\u2019s a pain to make a village with only a hundred people.</p><br/><p>There is that underground lake in the cave, but there\u2019s no fish and high magic energy density.</p><br/><p>Well, since it\u2019s Gabil, he can handle that much, right?</p><br/><p>They could also cultivate Hipokte grass while they are at it.</p><br/><p>However, would sending them into the cave prove perilous to them?</p><br/><p>The five guards I left to Souei.</p><br/><p>Hopefully he can raise them into fine ninja and kunoichi.</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019m scared, I\u2019ll be sure to avoid their practices.</p><br/><p>Gabil\u2019s group is the problematic one, however.</p><br/><p>Even if I send them into the cave they probably won\u2019t become monster feed, but\u2026</p><br/><p>As Dragonewts, their fighting strength is B rank.</p><br/><p>They should have no problem defeating most monsters in there, but the centipede could cause them some trouble.</p><br/><p>But since they are experienced warriors and are carrying weapons they should be fine, right?</p><br/><p>I shouldn\u2019t worry about Gabil either. His evolution placed him at rank A-.</p><br/><p>He also obtained quite a lot of magical energy.</p><br/><p>So maybe he\u2019ll end up as an A rank.</p><br/><p>\u300cGabil, I want to leave harvesting Hipokte grass in the caves to you, how about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I asked,</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease leave it to me! This Gabil will work himself to the bone for your sake!\u300d</p><br/><p>He casually responded.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll leave it to him.</p><br/><p>Besides, if they start living there, they can also double as the cave\u2019s guards.</p><br/><p>And so Gabil\u2019s group started harvesting hipokte grass in the caves.</p><br/><p>I had some lingering worries, so I came to check, but they seem to be doing just fine.</p><br/><p>And since they are constantly fighting, they are becoming stronger.</p><br/><p>Right now, they can bring down a centipede with just the five of them.</p><br/><p>How reassuring.</p><br/><p>I should also send them new weapons. So I thought.</p><br/><p>And thus, some time passed.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Two months have passed since I returned to the city.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone was getting used to life here and production was going smoothly,</p><br/><p>And the moment we finished the last house,</p><br/><p>The goblins.</p><br/><p>If I had to say, about eight thousand of them.</p><br/><p>Showed up and knelt before me, saying</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you may, please make us your servants as well!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cWe humbly beg you!!!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>They said falling prostrate before me.</p><br/><p>I thought for a second.</p><br/><p>If I refuse them, that may seed conflict later on.</p><br/><p>Besides, I also strictly ordered not to discriminate against other races.</p><br/><p>If I send them away that may set a precedent of discrimination.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s accept them. So I decided.</p><br/><p>\u300cFine. But I will drive away anyone who\u2019s slacking, is that fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I accepted them lightly.</p><br/><p>But little did I know that another struggle was soon upon me!</p><br/><p>Again! My screams could be heard immediately after.</p><br/><p>To say the least, I used numbers and thus created the Green Corps.</p><br/><p>That was the moment the famous Green Corps was born. Along with the Yellow Corps, they would be known as having no equal, the crux of my force.</p><br/><p>Right now, they were but dirty goblins.</p><br/><p>And a month later, I finally finished naming them.</p><br/><p>But this was not a complete tragedy. My total amount of magical energy has increased.</p><br/><p>I mean, I kept emptying time after time again, so it was bound to increase a bit.</p><br/><p>And thus, I finished naming the goblins.</p><br/><p>By the time I finished naming them, we also finished constructing housing for everyone.</p><br/><p>I had the goblins stay in a boarding house for now, but that\u2019s certainly better than camping out in a tent.</p><br/><p>We had a system for drawing water, a well in every house, so it is a pretty advanced city.</p><br/><p>Having a flush toilet is also heavenly.</p><br/><p>There is a need to carry the pumped out water to the toilet in a bucket, but strong monsters don\u2019t particularly mind.</p><br/><p>There are also those who don\u2019t excrete, though. Me included.</p><br/><p>However, we can\u2019t have the city stinking.</p><br/><p>That much I will not permit.</p><br/><p>However, there are still many fields and animal farms that haven\u2019t seen success.</p><br/><p>I want to make sure this city grows in abundance.</p><br/><p>I have finally acquired a land where I can live at peace.</p><br/><p>Here are those who were with me at the time,</p><br/><p>Oni \u2013 6 people</p><br/><p>Tempest Star Wolf \u2013 1 member</p><br/><p>Star Leader \u2013 1 member</p><br/><p>Star Wolves \u2013 100 members</p><br/><p>Goblin Riders \u2013 100 people</p><br/><p>Goblin King \u2013 1 person</p><br/><p>Goblin Lords \u2013 8 people</p><br/><p>Hobgoblins \u2013 8,657 people</p><br/><p>Orc King \u2013 1 person</p><br/><p>High Orcs \u2013 1,984 people</p><br/><p>Dragonewts \u2013 106 people</p><br/><p>And 4 dwarfs supporting us.</p><br/><p>There are over ten thousand monsters inhabiting these lands.</p><br/><p>And thus we finished the city.</p><br/><p>End of the Forest Disturbance Arc</p><br/>\n</div>"}

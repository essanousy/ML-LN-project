As I expected, this is hard.)</p><br/><p>Venom thought so while regenerating the left arm that had been cut.</p><br/><p>At this rate, his defeat was just a matter of time.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been three minutes since the fight started.</p><br/><p>However, he could sense that the people had begun evacuating from the place, Venom guessed that Masayuki had conducted it well.</p><br/><p>He buying some time seemed to be turning out well.</p><br/><p>(Well now. To defeat this guy, my power is definitely not enough. If there\u2019s some kind of chance \u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>Even though he knew that the situation is getting worse gradually, he has no other choice but to continue with the intense offense and defense.</p><br/><p>In order to break from this situation, Venom needs to think of a plan\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re late, but we\u2019ll help!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI will try my best not to hold you down!\u300d </p><br/><p>The arrival of Kenya and Ryouta changed the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou kids, I don\u2019t want to be hated by Agera, so don\u2019t die!\u300d</p><br/><p>Venom shouted while dealing with Arios\u2019 attack.</p><br/><p>To be honest, Venom was irritated of the idea of borrowing the children\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>However, his defeat is just a matter of time, so it\u2019s not the time to complain.</p><br/><p>(Both of them are strong! Well, I will use them.)</p><br/><p>That was what Venom really thinks.</p><br/><p>\u300cI get it! Shishou has said it many times.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYea. If we died here without his permission, Shishou would probably kill you\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The two said so.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>\u300cFor that reason, let\u2019s go all out!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKenya, we\u2019re using that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah! Spiritual Armament\u30fbReforged\u2015\u2015 Activate!\u300d</p><br/><p>Glittering lights wrapped both Kenya and Ryouta.</p><br/><p>And then, the arms they got from Rimuru were worn on their body.</p><br/><p>It was the armor that Rimuru made with Hinata\u2019s spiritual armaments as the reference.</p><br/><p>Its performance is better than the unique class spiritual armament used by the holy knight, but it hasn\u2019t reach legend class.</p><br/><p>However, it could be said that the arms will grow according to the growth of the person who wearing it, it\u2019s the newest product that should be called as Advanced Weapon (Evolving Type Arms).</p><br/><p>Above all else, the equipment has good compatibility with the children who integrated with spirit in their body.</p><br/><p>Although Rimuru had experimented and made a lot as a hobby and it will go wasteful lying around, such is the reason why he gave it to the children\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He would never imagine that it would be useful in this place.</p><br/><p>Arios seemed to perceive the danger, as there was a slight impatience in his expressionless face.</p><br/><p>So does Venom.</p><br/><p>(Heh, those kids\u2026\u2026 they have almost the same energy amount as me!?</p><br/><p>I thought they might be strong, but to be this extent\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Venom was amazed.</p><br/><p>In fact, Ryouta is about half of Venom\u2019s. As for Kenya, Venom felt the energy is almost equal to his.</p><br/><p>Their skill is trained by Agera.</p><br/><p>Venom finds a good chance to win with the reinforcement that stronger than he thought.</p><br/><p>And so the fight will be fiercer.</p><br/><p>While watching the children\u2019s participation, Hinata muttered.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be, spiritual armaments\u2026\u2026? That is the church\u2019s secret arms that can\u2019t be used by holy knight unless they were loved by the spirits \u2015\u2015 for it to be easily mass produced, as expected from the abnormal Demon Lord Rimuru\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Her impression was mixed with surprise and admiration.</p><br/><p>Everyone from the church have a similar expression with Hinata.</p><br/><p>Apart from Nicholas who is a magician, Leonard and Fritz were lost for words.</p><br/><p>Naturally, it\u2019s because looking at 12 or 13 years old children showing more fighting power than a holy knight.</p><br/><p>Above all else \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cMoreover, Elemental Knight (Spirit Knight), is it?</p><br/><p>My master, Izawa Shizue had talked about\u2015\u2015 the ultimate fusion form of human and spirit.</p><br/><p>Neither Shizu-san nor I can reach it, the strongest knight.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015is that the appearances of those with Hero\u2019s Egg hatched?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSurpassing the holy knight, humanity\u2019s strongest knight\u2015\u2015 the Elemental Knight\u2026..\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell done Masayuki-dono, you trained those children splendidly!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEhh!? A, ah. Rather than my training, I\u2019d said it\u2019s those children\u2019s power\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>When such topic suddenly brought up, Masayuki hurriedly denied it.</p><br/><p>(What I taught to them is just special move poses I saw in manga! How can it be called as a training!?)</p><br/><p>Masayuki denied it while being tired with the same flow of event.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, don\u2019t be so humble! Even if you didn\u2019t say it, everyone knows it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying anything is useless, so it\u2019s reflected in his companions\u2019 faces as Masayuki trying to hiding his embarrassment.</p><br/><p>And, the same excitement runs through those who heard the conversation, quickly hope rises inside them.</p><br/><p>To Hero Masayuki\u2019s companions.</p><br/><p>To the people who evacuating.</p><br/><p>To the knights and soldiers who guide the populace.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you hear it? They seem to be stronger than Hinata-sama who is the strongest holy knight!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHero? Are those children Hero too?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey are Hero Masayuki\u2019s apprentice\u2026.. So a Hero\u2019s apprentice is also a Hero\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen there\u2019s no need to be scared of just a single angel right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat, it\u2019s not a big deal, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStupid! That\u2019s wrong. Hero Masayuki-sama is amazing you know!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, that\u2019s right. As expected of Masayuki-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>And so, like this, the people\u2019s anxiety dissolved with great speed.</p><br/><p>As a result, the people who were trembling and agitated have calmed down, and so they continued the evacuation smoothly without problem.</p><br/><p>Masayuki learnt that anything he says is useless.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s enough, if with that\u2026\u2026 if with that everyone\u2019s anxiety gone, I\u2019m fine with it!)</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Masayuki concludes that his task is to stand up with confidence face, and so he takes the stance to watching the fight attentively.</p><br/><p>For this reason, there\u2019s something only Masayuki noticed.</p><br/><p>(Eh? Wasn\u2019t Kenya\u2019s group is a party of five?)</p><br/><p>So, one of them is missing from the group.</p><br/><p>(They are Kenya, Ryouta, Gale, Alice. Eh? Who\u2019s the other one? Umm, maybe I\u2019m mistaken. I only know 4 people.)</p><br/><p>Although he has notice it with great effort, Masayuki concluded that it\u2019s just misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>Because they children influenced by Masayuki were only four people, that was the truth in a certain way.</p><br/><p>Masayuki quickly switches his thought and prayed for Venom\u2019s victory.</p><br/><p>And so, about the fight\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Venom was in one-side defensive fight until the situation changed completely with the children\u2019s participation.</p><br/><p>Venom creating a gap in Arios\u2019 defense which then Kenya attacks.</p><br/><p>It became a coordinated attack.</p><br/><p>The secret was\u300eTelepathy\u300f.</p><br/><p>Venom allocated some of his computing process and enabled\u300eTelepathy\u300fwith the children.</p><br/><p>With this, it\u2019s possible for them to communicate with super high speed thought.</p><br/><p>While the three are fighting, they were in a conference at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u300eListen kids. You guys can fight somewhat, but you guys are still weak.</p><br/><p>Therefore, don\u2019t overconfident with your power, do only what you can do.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eRoger that!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eUnderstood!\u300f</p><br/><p>Kenya and Ryouta delightedly answers, Venom begins to instruct the strategy.</p><br/><p>\u300eRyouta, you\u2019ll be our defense.</p><br/><p>We\u2019re lucky that your attributes are water and wind.</p><br/><p>While healing me and Kenya when we are injured with water attribute, devote yourself in defense with help of wind attribute.</p><br/><p>Listen, the strategy is messed up if you\u2019re injured. Be careful!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYes!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ll be attacking with the assumption of getting injured . I\u2019m expecting your healing.</p><br/><p>However, healing magic of holy system which will damage a demon is no good. I\u2019ll kill you if you making a mistake!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve studied, I\u2019ll not make a mistake!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eAlright! But, prioritize your own safety. Don\u2019t make a mistake, okay?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eOkay!\u300f</p><br/><p>The key of the strategy was Ryouta\u2019s healing.</p><br/><p>Like this, Venom doesn\u2019t need to worry about healing himself as he\u2019s keep on attack.</p><br/><p>Well, even if Ryouta failed, Venom thought that he will manage somehow due to Masayuki\u2019s luck.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s because he can\u2019t win against Arios unless he takes a drastic strategy.</p><br/><p>Next, Venom instructs Kenya.</p><br/><p>\u300eKenya, you will focus on offensive.</p><br/><p>Although there\u2019s healing from Ryouta, I want the healing to be focused on me.</p><br/><p>So, I want you to use your strongest attack at the time that it will surely hit.</p><br/><p>Get it? No need to do the impossible.</p><br/><p>If you get inured too much, Ryouta\u2019s healing won\u2019t catch up.</p><br/><p>Because I will desperately seal that guy\u2019s movement, you must think a way to make him accumulate damage without panicking.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI get it! In short, Venom-san will be the Tank, right?\u300f</p><br/><p>Venom nods to Kenya\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>He often heard the term during the training in the labyrinth, Tank is a vanguard who tanking vigorous attacks of melee type monster single handedly.</p><br/><p>Judging that Kenya has understood the strategy, Venom continued his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u300eExactly. So, listen! That guy seemed to be a former human, he still relying on his eyes when fighting.</p><br/><p>That is his weakness, understand?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYes! We had been taught by Hakurou-Shishou and Agera-Shishou.</p><br/><p>Or rather, when I rely too much on my eyes, my eyes got crushed you know? That\u2019s a common sense!\u300f</p><br/><p>Venom nods to those words.</p><br/><p>Using Full Potion, any body part loss can be recovered.</p><br/><p>With such reasoning, Hakurou and Agera seemed to have calmly crushed the clueless children\u2019s eyes and trained them.</p><br/><p>(Those two, they are Demon\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Kenya and co seems to accept the training without a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have become stronger\u2026..\u201d So Venom convinced inside his mind.</p><br/><p>\u300eAlright, it\u2019s good if you two understand it.</p><br/><p>That guy didn\u2019t lose his habits from when he was a human, he\u2019s unconsciously protecting his eyes and important organs.</p><br/><p>We use that against him and attack.</p><br/><p>However! Pay attention to his sword.</p><br/><p>Defending against it is pointless, don\u2019t think of stopping the sword with a weapon\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eUnderstood! It feels more dangerous than Zegion-san\u2019s\u300eAbsolute Severance\u300f.\u300f</p><br/><p>Venom smiles and laughs when he heard Kenya\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>In fact, the power of Arios\u2019 sword was above Zegion\u2019s\u300eAbsolute Severance\u300f.</p><br/><p>Although, even if both are same in the point that you can\u2019t defend against it, Venom thought that Zegion\u2019s ability that doesn\u2019t need to rely on a medium like a sword to be more troublesome.</p><br/><p>In any case, Venom can only praise Kenya for being able to see accurately the opponent\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>As expected from Hakurou and Agera\u2019s training, Venom raised his valuation of Kenya.</p><br/><p>And so, confident with the success of the strategy, he\u2019s fired up to put it into practice. </p><br/><p>\u300eAlright! Well, you guys don\u2019t be unreasonable okay. Well then, Game Start!\u300f</p><br/><p>Through such exchanges, the fight against Arios begun.</p><br/><p>With Ryouta as support, Venom attacks Arios with everything he got in order to breakthrough his defense, Kenya then attacks Arios in the gaps.</p><br/><p>Arios who receiving the attacks, shown a bit agitation on his face, but he immediately dealt with it calmly as he didn\u2019t get any fatal wound.</p><br/><p>Although, by unconsciously evading attacks that he doesn\u2019t need to evade as Arios is a spiritual life-form, he didn\u2019t notice that he receives attacks that shouldn\u2019t hit.</p><br/><p>Arios fell completely into Venom\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>There were reasons why Arios didn\u2019t notice Venom\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>The first one is he should have already defeated the opponent who is lower-rank than him normally, which make him feels irritated.</p><br/><p>But the problem was that his original power was sealed.</p><br/><p>By Velda\u2019s order, he was forbidden to attack the downtown area.</p><br/><p>For Arios who violated the order and acted individually, violating the order more than this is taboo.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he was restricted in using his Ultimate Skill\u300eWeapon Lord (Sword Weapon)\u300f.</p><br/><p>As Venom and co felt, if Arios unleash the sword\u2019s power, he can release \u201cSeverance Wave\u201d which cut everything.</p><br/><p>However, the power is too big and it will affect the city as well.</p><br/><p>Arios was placed in a situation where he could do nothing but to fight Venom and co with such restriction.</p><br/><p>This was all due to the effect of the\u300eLucky Field\u300f created by Masayuki.</p><br/><p>Arios who looking down on his lower-ranked opponent, but unaware he was caught in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>(It can\u2019t be, for these annoying people\u2026\u2026 They\u2019re standing in front of me with their half-baked ability\u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>While being annoyed, only time will passes as he will not receive any decisive attack.</p><br/><p>Getting impatient about that, Arios didn\u2019t notice that he gradually losing his calmness.</p><br/><p>If he was calm, he would give up on killing Hinata and quickly withdraw.</p><br/><p>However, Arios didn\u2019t make such option.</p><br/><p>It was like his thought disturbed and can\u2019t make clear decision.</p><br/><p>As a result\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cNow! Finish off this guy together with me!\u300d</p><br/><p>So Venom shouted.</p><br/><p>Arios\u2019 sword which pierced Venom\u2019s stomach can\u2019t be pulled out as it had been ensnared by Venom\u2019s magic power.</p><br/><p>He has no problem erasing the sword once, but he will receive Kenya\u2019s attack directly in that case\u2015\u2015 </p><br/><p>\u300cKenya, leave Venom-san \u2018s healing to me!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUooooooooh\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\uff01Unlimited\u30fbJustice Bringer[1]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>A single flash.</p><br/><p>Arios whose decision gets derailed by hesitation for a moment receives a direct hit from Kenya\u2019s strongest attack.</p><br/><p>Even Venom who suppressing Arios, was cut in two by the terrifying sword attack.</p><br/><p>Kenya\u2019s enhanced spiritual power could exceed the limit for a brief moment. That\u2019s because the divine protection of spirit of light which fused with Kenya \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Worthy as a future Hero, he reached the level where he can destroy even an awakened demon lord.</p><br/><p>In other words\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cIm, impossible\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>With those as his last words, Arios was swallowed by the torrent of light and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey did it!\u201d That\u2019s Masayuki\u2019s impression.</p><br/><p>Kenya\u2019s technique was amazing, but his pose of accumulating power closely resembled the special move from manga that Masayuki taught.</p><br/><p>(Ehh!? That becomes a really amazing power\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>Although he was dumbfounded by many things, he can only accept the reality.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, as I expected. Kenya, you seem to have mastered the technique I taught you perfectly!\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki praised Kenya with a refreshing smile \u2015\u2015His inner thoughts aside\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cMasayuki an-chan, did you see it? I did it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki nodded to Kenya who smiling.</p><br/><p>Cheers of the people who were delayed in evacuation began reverberating, announcing the end of the fight.</p><br/><p>(Like this, Kenya might stand out as a Hero more than me from now, I think it\u2019s a good thing!)</p><br/><p>While thinking it\u2019s convenient for him and sprouted a smile, Masayuki didn\u2019t notice that his smiling face charmed everyone.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, please heal me quickly!\u300d</p><br/><p>Despite being cut in two, Venom seems to have escaped from the torrent of light somehow and making a fuss.</p><br/><p>Ryouta, Alice, Hinata and also Nicholas came running, everyone use healing magic and so Venom regenerated without problem.</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course! Self-sacrificing myself, it doesn\u2019t suit me at all!\u300d</p><br/><p>Venom hiding his embarrassment while saying such thing.</p><br/><p>However, Venom has secretly obtained the source of Ultimate Skill\u300eWeapon Lord (Sword Weapon) \u300fas he shrewdly stole Arios\u2019 energy.</p><br/><p>It was exactly as Venom\u2018s calculation.</p><br/><p>Normally it\u2019s a strategy with low chances to succeed when put into action, but his decision that it was worth to try it was correct thanks to Masayuki\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>Venom wins the gamble and obtained more power.</p><br/><p>When Venom was healed and things calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? Where is Kuu-chan?\u300d</p><br/><p>Ryouta looked around and asked such question.</p><br/><p>Noticing the same thing, Kenya also searching the surroundings restlessly.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Kuu-chan is gone. She goes out as she pleases again\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKuu-chan liked unusual things after all!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gale and Alice let out a sigh, they answered like they gave up on the matter.</p><br/><p>\u300cAgain? It can\u2019t be helped then\u2026\u2026 Since we slipped out to come here, it would be bad if she doesn\u2019t return soon though\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Kenya\u2019s worry is not about the person called Kuu-chan who seems to be their companion, it was towards the fact that if they didn\u2019t return quickly, their absent would be found out and get scolded.</p><br/><p>\u300cWho is Kuu-chan?\u300d</p><br/><p>To Masayuki\u2019s question, the children answer all together\u300eA friend!\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, they\u2019re a group of five from the start after all.\u2019 While thinking so, Masayuki stopped thinking any more by understanding that it was another child he didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to be worried now as the enemy is beaten.</p><br/><p>The children start to search for their friend in order to return back quickly.</p><br/><p>And so, Masayuki and co was busy with the clean up afterwards in order to eliminate the anxiety from the people of royal capital as they originally intended.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>In the sky over the royal capital of Ingrassia Kingdom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it!\u2019 while shouting so, Arios spits out a rough breath.</p><br/><p>Arios managed to escape from the worst situation thanks to\u300eDuplicate Body\u300f that he prepared just in case.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s not time to get flustered. If I\u2019m thinking calmly, I can grasp that the enemy\u2019s fighting strength is significant.</p><br/><p>That brat has such much power. But, knowing it now there\u2019s\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>However\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cFumufumu. As expected, everyone think alike.

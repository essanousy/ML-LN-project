I would be able to fight them just fine if I had a Powered Suit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman said angrily.</p><br/><p>It was true.</p><br/><p>With the firepower of the Powered Suits, such a fight would be easy.</p><br/><p>However, the only weapon that Karman and his men had now were the cyborg Plasma Gatling.</p><br/><p>This was because Beretta had destroyed all five suits.</p><br/><p>The Plasma Gatling was a frightful weapon that sprayed superheated energy bullets, but it was still an anti-human weapon.</p><br/><p>It was not enough against a giant like a Super Beast.</p><br/><p>After all, the most notable feature of the Super Beast was its ridiculous ability to regenerate.</p><br/><p>Even if you severed their limbs or tentacles, they would grow back.</p><br/><p>And so the only way to defeat them was by destroying more than two-thirds of their body at once.</p><br/><p>This would require burning them or some other method to annihilate them.</p><br/><p>It was more than possible with the Powered Suits, but impossible with any small weapon.</p><br/><p>Those who were enjoying the barbecue now froze. It had all happened so suddenly that they did not know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! We\u2019ll lure them away. Run when you get the chance!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza shouted at the adults.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t, Mister Zaza! There are Super Beasts behind us!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Rindo who answered.</p><br/><p>As he stated, Super Beasts had appeared behind them out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>They were now completely surrounded.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the children did not understand the situation and remained calm.</p><br/><p>They were surprised to be sure, but not enough to let go of their plates.</p><br/><p>There were even some who were bold enough to snatch meat off of the plates of the stunned adults.</p><br/><p>After all, Veldora was their hero, and Veldora continued to cook the meat as if nothing of note was happening.</p><br/><p>This was enough to assure them that nothing was wrong.</p><br/><p>In fact, when Karma had come, and when Michelle had come, Veldora had always been cooking something. And every time, things had ended without much trouble at all.</p><br/><p>The grill may have seemed cursed to someone like Zaza, but to the children, it was a symbol of safety.</p><br/><p>As for what Veldora and Ramiris were doing\u2026</p><br/><p>They glanced at the Super Beasts with carefree expressions as the meat sizzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Ramiris. Those things are apparently called Super Beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. But, Master\u2026 Don\u2019t you think\u2026they look pretty unimpressive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. As you can see, they don\u2019t attack us because they are so afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Veldora, it cannot be helped. Unlike humans, beasts have an instinct that allows them to see an opponent\u2019s strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems to be the case. But I don\u2019t like this. How will I be able to show how amazing I am\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Master. I want more meat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you listening, Ramiris? This is the most important part, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you should just give up on that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides, the children already trust you Lord Veldora. You can make people understand your greatness without rushing to do things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho. I see. That is very true. They might respect me after using my skills, but that doesn\u2019t seem quite right. I won\u2019t say who, but someone from Rimuru\u2019s homeland did the same thing and suffered for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Master. I was just thinking the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. I don\u2019t think it is right at all. There is no need to rush. That is very true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s settled then, Master. Now, I\u2019ll have another!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora clicked his tongue at Ramiris\u2019s lack of concern in the matter, but he still gave her another slice of meat.</p><br/><p>He was also cooking more for the children.</p><br/><p>Veldora was a surprisingly kind and caring person.</p><br/><p>Ramiris ate it with a delighted expression. She stuffed the food into her mouth at such a pace that one would wonder how it all fit into such a small frame.</p><br/><p>The children also seemed oblivious to the panic of the adults. They continued to enjoy the barbecue.</p><br/><p>Unlike Zaza and the others who were incredibly tense, their world was peace itself.</p><br/><p>However, this was soon interrupted by Zaza\u2019s shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, HEEEEEY!! How can you all be so calm!? Stop your reckless meat-eating and prepare to allow the others to escape!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza could no longer ignore it. Blue veins popped on his forehead as he complained.</p><br/><p>Veldora looked at him with an exasperated sigh and answered.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It wasn\u2019t electric signals. It was real taste.</p><br/><p>This was the true thing that fulfilled one of the three great desires of humans.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t about gaining energy. It was about satisfying the soul.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Sharma realized this truth.</p><br/><p>And as for Rindo\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot allow you to carry all the weight. I too will learn of the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora and Ramiris watched this display and wondered why they were exaggerating so much. Rindo cut himself a piece of pound cake and brought it to his mouth.</p><br/><p>And\u2013</p><br/><p>(\u2026Impossible!? Is this what real taste is\u2026!!)</p><br/><p>He was shocked.</p><br/><p>It was as if everything he had ever known was a lie.</p><br/><p>The first thing that had filled Rindo\u2019s heart was a sense of mistrust towards Veldora and the others.</p><br/><p>He had thought that they were spies from the Empire that had been sent to find their hideout.</p><br/><p>However, they turned out to be very strange.</p><br/><p>As he wondered about this, they had then ridiculed the food that had been offered as a show of gratitude.</p><br/><p>After that, Rindo\u2019s heart became full of rage towards them.</p><br/><p>But the ability to calmly make decisions was always required of him, and so he had repressed these emotions and watched silently\u2026and now, the small girl called Ramiris had served them food.</p><br/><p>The distrust. The rage. The shock.</p><br/><p>Rindo\u2019s heart swayed between the emotions in confusion.</p><br/><p>Where had the thermos and snacks from from? And the thing\u2013the magic that Ramiris had used\u2013what was that?</p><br/><p>It would take immense power to gather the water from the atmosphere like that\u2026 Was this miniature Automata really that powerful?</p><br/><p>How did it work?</p><br/><p>And if they used this technology, could they create lots of water?</p><br/><p>Would they be able to solve their very serious concern regarding water shortages\u2026?</p><br/><p>There was no end to his questions.</p><br/><p>And not only questions, but ambitions.</p><br/><p>But he pushed all these thoughts and questions aside for now in order to follow Sharma in eating the food\u2014and that was when all his questions were blown away.</p><br/><p>The insult of having their precious water referred to as mud water\u2013he understood it now, with the tea in front of him.</p><br/><p>Ah, damn it all! So this was what the real stuff was like.</p><br/><p>He had not known.</p><br/><p>He should not know\u2026</p><br/><p>But now that he did, he would have to eat the imitation that could never satisfy him, and bear it.</p><br/><p>\u2013Yes, it had happened already. He could feel it.</p><br/><p>(Ahh. And Zaza knew it more than anyone\u2026)</p><br/><p>Rindo now understood the meaning behind Zaza\u2019s warning earlier.</p><br/><p>Zaza was an older cyborg model, and so he had had to bear this pain for over a hundred years.</p><br/><p>He had known some of it, but he had no idea what that pain might feel like.</p><br/><p>And now he would be just the same as him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cZaza. Do you mind if I ask you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. What is it, Rindo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza answered with a look of concern.</p><br/><p>But he knew what the question would be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cA long time ago\u2026were such wonderful foods accessible for everybody?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was exactly what Zaza had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes. My daughter once baked me cookies. They were good. Very good. Even if they were a little burnt and odd in shape\u2026but it\u2019s not about those things. There was a warmth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Rindo nodded and thought about it.</p><br/><p>The food in front of them made Zaza\u2019s argument so much stronger.</p><br/><p>He had never heard of Zaza having a daughter before, but it seemed rude to ask about it.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had not mentioned her before suggested that the war had\u2026</p><br/><p>And then Rindo began to mutter to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy. This war, why did it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The thirty-year old Rindo and the fifty-year old Sharma were forced into this lifestyle because of the scars left by the war.</p><br/><p>The responsibility for this was with their parents\u2019 generation. Or perhaps the generation before that.</p><br/><p>He knew that it was pointless to complain about it now, but he could not help but think in this way.</p><br/><p>They had to attack the Empire\u2019s food producing plants and steal\u2013that\u2019s what they had to do to survive in this world.</p><br/><p>They purified the polluted water and secured the bare minimum.</p><br/><p>Luxury was not permitted. Everyone worked together in their desperate struggle to survive.</p><br/><p>And this was all possible because they didn\u2019t even know what luxury was.</p><br/><p>But now that he did, he could not help but hate the \u2018great war\u2019 which was the reason they were now suffering\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 It was because we were weak\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m the one who is sorry. I got a little excited\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Rindo accepted Zaza\u2019s apology.</p><br/><p>Zaza was not at fault here, but it seemed like the natural thing to do.</p><br/><p>The air in the room felt very oppressive now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey. Master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it\u2026Ramiris?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yes. I tried to stop you, remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t! You were happily eating the cake!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTha-that\u2019s not true. Well, nevermind that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s important! Oh, well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two culprits became frantic.</p><br/><p>They began to whisper to each other so that Sharma and the others could not hear.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If they like it so much that they can cry, maybe we should give them more?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris started to suggest, but Beretta stopped her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Ramiris, I do not think you should do that. Lord Rimuru will not be pleased.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is irresponsible. Lord Rimuru believes that interactions with other words must be conducted with the utmost caution. We are already involved enough as it is. If we go in any deeper, we will be held responsible for these people. And it is unthinkable that we could choose a side when we do not even know which side is for true justice in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta was warning her\u2013if she had no intention of looking after them after this, then she should not give them any false hope.</p><br/><p>It would not be difficult for Ramiris to prepare food for a thousand people.</p><br/><p>However, it would not continue on forever.</p><br/><p>Only a demon would do something so irresponsible when they had no intention of taking care of them until the end without receiving anything in return.</p><br/><p>Beretta was a former demon, and so he knew more than anyone, the pain felt by humans when dropped into the pits of despair from the heights of joy.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That\u2019s true. Okay. I shall be more careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be for the best. At least, we should learn more about the situation in this world before choosing to side with these people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora and Ramiris looked at each other and nodded after hearing Beretta\u2019s warning.</p><br/><p>It may already be too late, but neither of them wanted to create more reasons for Rimuru to get angry.</p><br/><p>And so the two of them took Beretta\u2019s opinion into account and then used Thought Transmission to talk about what direction to take from there.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

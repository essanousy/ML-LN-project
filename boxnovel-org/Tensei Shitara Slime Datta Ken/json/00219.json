That lizard! He\u2019s really, really urgh!! Why he does take things this far\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>She was raging so much, that her body was shaking and trembling little by little.</p><br/><p>While having a hard time of restraining it, Ruminas pondered.</p><br/><p>The ground was flooded with pillars of lightning, anyone unfortunate enough to be hit by it would immediately carbonize.</p><br/><p>Anyone can see clearly that it just a matter of time before damage befalls the inner city area.</p><br/><p>The threefold barrier that protected the Holy City has already unable to perform its task.</p><br/><p>The large-scale magic essence warding barrier in the border had vanished due to the shock wave created when Dagruel and Veldora clashed.</p><br/><p>It was unable to endure it even for a moment and was blown away, but it had valiantly tried to resist.</p><br/><p>The anti-monster attack defense barrier which protected the daily lives around the holy capital was in the similar condition.</p><br/><p>After all, as the barrier was set with the purpose of preventing monster attack of a certain level and below, it\u2019d rather harsh to expect it to be able to withstand the attacks of \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d or \u201cTitan\u201d that can be called super life form.</p><br/><p>This also was blown away so quickly.</p><br/><p>The only one left was just the Evil Purification barrier.</p><br/><p>The people who maintain the barrier raised their angry complaints while crying tears of blood.</p><br/><p>If one of them lost their focus, it was certain that the barrier would collapse immediately.</p><br/><p>That is without exception the \u201cSeven Celestial Sages\u201d who commanded the barrier maintenance.</p><br/><p>In adherence to Ruminas\u2019 order, they risked their lives, doing their best to maintain the barrier.</p><br/><p>Luckily they changed the barrier to anti-holy attribute using Holy Demonic Inversion, in order to prevent the angel\u2019s invasion.</p><br/><p>Veldora aside, Dagruel\u2019s attribute is\u300eHoly\u300f.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they managed to succeed in maintaining the barrier.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the barrier purpose was to be anti-Veldora, but it had become useless\u2026..</p><br/><p>Ruminas let out a sigh sharply as she was watching the battle unfolding in the sky.</p><br/><p>A battle of transcendent ability that exceeded even Ruminas\u2019 imagination.</p><br/><p>Of course, even if Ruminas attempted to participate in the battle, it would be suicidal.</p><br/><p>Even if she wants to complain, there\u2019s no way to voice it.</p><br/><p>Therefore, unable to do anything but watching was her current situation.</p><br/><p>And so, the battle grew more intense\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Next to Ruminas is Shion who was enthralled by the battle with intense concentration.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s natural so Ruminas thought. After all, such battle of myths like this was something that won\u2019t happen even once in 1000 years.</p><br/><p>The battle between strong people, it\u2019s an experience where other people could only do nothing but to see it.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, such a battle between transcendents, no one has ever seen.</p><br/><p>One more thing, the lump of plasma of Thunderstorm that was repelled by Dagruel, came flying and created a crater as it directly hit the inner city area.</p><br/><p>(That damn lizard! Did he intend to destroy my country once more!? He really needs to pay attention to his surroundings!!)</p><br/><p>Ruminas thinking about such unreasonable thing.</p><br/><p>Although she fully aware that it\u2019s an impossible thing, she couldn\u2019t help but to think so.</p><br/><p>And so, in the battle between Veldora and Dagruel, they changed into close combat fight by changing to their human form.</p><br/><p>No one able to take their eyes off.</p><br/><p>The super-class fight will soon approach its end.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Veldora mutters something in a small voice, prismatic darkness was created.</p><br/><p>(What is this!?)</p><br/><p>It spread at a terrific speed and wrapped up the surroundings\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>When Ruminas sensed the danger it\u2019s already too late.</p><br/><p>Her panic increased, Ruminas\u2019 defensive barrier has no meaning.</p><br/><p>Resistance is meaningless, Ruminas\u2019 thought was swallowed by the prismatic darkness.</p><br/><p>One of the seven great nobles that served Ruminas, Archduke Gunther Strauss who is the head, confronted a considerable threat.</p><br/><p>He was fighting against one of the Executioners.</p><br/><p>Furuki Mai who using the Crescent Bow.</p><br/><p>Mai\u2019s outward appearance was of a 16 years old high school student, but her fighting power was beyond description.</p><br/><p>Gunther is a True Ancestor Vampire who lived since the ancient times who is called archduke.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s a strong person who surpassed a simple Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>His ability is equaled to Karion who is a former Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>And yet, in front of Mai, all he can do is defend.</p><br/><p>The seven great nobles and the subordinates under them were assigned with the role to assault Dagruel\u2019s army from the flank as a mobile army.</p><br/><p>However, that strategy was prevented by Mai alone.</p><br/><p>Because people other than Gunther had been annihilated by Mai\u2019s Stardust Rain.</p><br/><p>The vampire\u2019s super regeneration can\u2019t catch up due to the terrifying meteor arrows.</p><br/><p>The only one who barely alive was the other great nobles who was always quarreling with him.</p><br/><p>While managing to somehow cooperate, they defended against Mai\u2019s attacks but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a story from a little while ago.</p><br/><p>People who receive the direct hit from the arrow become unable to regenerate, they lost the ability to continue fighting.</p><br/><p>Currently, the only one who able to move in this place was only Gunther.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, you\u2019re so tenacious. It would be better if you fall down quickly, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up, you lowly human! I will dig my fangs on your neck, and suck your blood dry!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gunther sustained a decrease in vital activity, which stimulated his survival instinct.</p><br/><p>Originally, he has no need to suck blood.</p><br/><p>In the old times, vampire act to absorbs mana (vitality) through blood, but after evolved, he able to absorbs mana directly from the prana (spirit)</p><br/><p>However, right now, his eye color changed, as he perceived Mai as his prey.</p><br/><p>Like a cornered beast, Gunther released all restrictions on his body.</p><br/><p>To his pride as an Archduke.</p><br/><p>He thought that he must not be defeated by a mere lass, Gunther released the taboo.</p><br/><p>Commanding his old blood, Gunther returns to his original appearance.</p><br/><p>Magic power runs through his whole body, transforming his body, to regain his form as the Emperor of the Night.</p><br/><p>To his past form as a Demon Lord before being a subordinate to Demon Lord Ruminas.</p><br/><p>However, even so \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cSo you said? That it would be better if I fall down quickly, and so\u300d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t reach Mai.</p><br/><p>Mai acquired Ultimate Skill\u300eMaster Weapon\u300fafter obtaining the power of Seraphim, and so she possesses combat power of an Awakened Demon Lord (Million Class)[1].</p><br/><p>Even among the Executioners, particularly\u2015\u2015 Sword, Shield, and Bow, those three people were the highest among all Yuuki\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>Arios who mastered the Bastard Sword.</p><br/><p>Zero who is an impregnable wall with his Star Shield.</p><br/><p>And, Mai who mastered the Crescent Bow.</p><br/><p>Those three people were an exception.</p><br/><p>Arios was once defeated by Damrada.</p><br/><p>That bitter experience seems to have promoted his growth.</p><br/><p>He threw away his self-conceit and became able to proceed through fights calmly without looking down on the enemy.</p><br/><p>The current Arios is like a different person.</p><br/><p>Zero in a few words was a silent man.</p><br/><p>However, he will certainly fulfill his given duties.</p><br/><p>From the start, he was a person worthy of special mention of his defensive power with his Unique Skill\u300eUnmovable One\u300f, but after awakened with Star Shield, Zero\u2019s defense was a perfect impregnable wall.</p><br/><p>And the last Mai is\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>With a flowing movement, she nocks her bow and shot her arrow.</p><br/><p>From a single arrow of a shot, it splits into many becoming like meteors.</p><br/><p>She is a One-man Army.</p><br/><p>Exactly, that title was appropriate for her.</p><br/><p>Gunther ungracefully lying on the ground with both of his hands and feet pierced by arrows.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou lowly human\u2015\u2015!!\u300d</p><br/><p>An arrow lodged into Gunther\u2019s throat, silencing his shout.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s done without any technique.</p><br/><p>Mai\u2019s strength was too overwhelming.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell now. I need to keep it easy and slowly. I won\u2019t leave anyone who obstructs Yuuki-kun alive.\u300d</p><br/><p>Mai indifferently nocks an arrow on her bow.</p><br/><p>In order to deal the final blow on Gunther\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019ll withdraw, this place is dangerous.\u300d</p><br/><p>A gigantic figure appeared and stopped Mai\u2019s movement.</p><br/><p>Even while Mai is surprised, she\u2019s relieved as she realizes that she knew the person well.</p><br/><p>\u300cZero, what do you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no time to explain it in detail. I felt it was dangerous. Will you understand if I say that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Only saying that much, Zero started teleportation magic formula without waiting for Mai\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>\u300cWai, wait a moment!? Aren\u2019t you the commander in this area? Why you\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Impossible\u2026.. you intend to leave behind the angels!?\u300d</p><br/><p>To Mai\u2019s astonished voice, Zero didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>And then\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cReturn!\u300d</p><br/><p>Zero teleported, bringing Mai along forcibly.</p><br/><p>Gunther\u2019s luck is strong, he had narrowly escaped death.</p><br/><p>Thanks due to his loss of consciousness, he didn\u2019t notice anything.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, the surroundings were swallowed by prismatic darkness\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Arnaud who was just fighting with the enemy\u2019s commander was left with surprise.</p><br/><p>At first, Arnaud leads the holy knight order to intercept the angel army.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Blood Knight led by the nobles also went to intercept the main force of the angel army.</p><br/><p>Although they lose in number, due the attribute inversion of the Evil Purification Barrier, the angel\u2019s invasion was prevented.</p><br/><p>If it was to intercept the invasion coming from the barrier\u2019s tear, then their disadvantage in number will be gone.</p><br/><p>However, when the commander of the angel army went to the front line, the angel\u2019s movement became quite different.</p><br/><p>The angels faithfully obey the commander\u2019s order.</p><br/><p>They attack like willing to sacrifice themselves and the tearing of the barrier accelerated.</p><br/><p>Among them, there also angel who does suicide bomb attack, so the progress of the battle has deteriorated in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then, the only way is to defeat the commander!\u2019</p><br/><p>The holy knight captains thought so and assault the enemy, but the strategy failed.</p><br/><p>That man who calls himself Zero was overwhelmingly strong.</p><br/><p>He never attacks at all, but he defended against all of Arnaud\u2019s attack with his huge shield.</p><br/><p>Arnaud with his result of training in the labyrinth, his strength is almost one step to Saint class now.</p><br/><p>Zero defended against all of Arnaud\u2019s attack as if he can completely see everything.</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019s like he can read one or two steps without a doubt.</p><br/><p>He was clearly an opponent on a different level.</p><br/><p>Zero is fighting against Arnaud while commanding the angels.</p><br/><p>Arnaud was enraged as he was being looked down upon, but in the end, he has no choice but to admit Zero\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>Zero resisted all of magics and warded off all sword strikes with his shield.</p><br/><p>He was like an immovable mountain.</p><br/><p>Even the flash sword Arnaud learned directly from Albert didn\u2019t hit Zero as it was prevented by Zero\u2019s big shield.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the shield seems to has effects of\u300eWeapon Destruction\u300fand\u300eAttack Reflection\u300f, Arnaud who one-sidedly attacking would be the one who receives damage.</p><br/><p>Just as much as he strengthened the aura cladding his sword, the damage would become larger.</p><br/><p>It was still good as the sword itself was okay.</p><br/><p>With the way things are going, he would be defeated without being able to do anything \u2015\u2015 Arnaud judged so, he decided for a temporary withdrawal.</p><br/><p>When he put out the order, Zero ceased commanding the angels.</p><br/><p>Zero leave behind the angels and went somewhere, such sudden action left Arnaud bewildered.</p><br/><p>As the commander disappears, the angels stopped moving.</p><br/><p>Although they carried out an automatic attack, the angel who lost their commander was just a disorderly crowd.</p><br/><p>While being confused unable read Zero\u2019s intention, Arnaud issue order to intercept the angel \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Arnaud also swallowed by the prismatic darkness.</p><br/><p>Without being able to understood what happened, Arno parted with his consciousness.</p><br/><p>Veldora standing in the center of the prismatic darkness sphere.</p><br/><p>In front of him is Dagruel.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015you, did you change the world with me as the seedbed?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. Rather than changing, the correct answer would be I return it to its origin.</p><br/><p>Because Fertile Paradox actually isn\u2019t an attack.</p><br/><p>I gave this land my divine protection. Using the corpses as the nourishment, I quicken the growth of nature.</p><br/><p>I restored this land where the magic disaster happened before to normal, in order to restore it to soil with good harvests.</p><br/><p>By the way, your body will be the core.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s impossible to cancel this effect\u2015\u2015 After all, it\u2019s because this is a restoration ability.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI aware of it. Such a cunning thing and also provoking, you know\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKuaahhahhahha! I\u2019ll accept it as a compliment.</p><br/><p>What? You don\u2019t need to worry. Your holy aura will be restored after hundreds of years at the quickest, or at the latest after a thousand years.</p><br/><p>Your current state would be restored completely and naturally reborn.</p><br/><p>At that time, the normalization of this land might also be completed.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKukukuku. Did you realize the current situation of my country?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm. The current situation where the water will be dried up in about several hundreds of years and it will become a land that impossible even for the giants to survive, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs I expected, you have realized it. Even the true reason of why I mobilized the Chain of Restrain Titan army to invaded Ruminas\u2019 territory\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNope\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know such a thing. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.</p><br/><p>Anyway, I don\u2019t really care whether there\u2019re only dead soldiers and you don\u2019t have young soldier, woman, and children among your subordinates.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFu, fuhahahaha! Do you pretend not knowing?</p><br/><p>Veldanava-sama\u2019s order is to protect the heaven gate in this land.</p><br/><p>We, the giants had faithfully obeyed that order.</p><br/><p>And so, I understood that we would perish in accordance with the order as it is.</p><br/><p>Even so, that\u2019s okay. If it\u2019s only me.</p><br/><p>But, I couldn\u2019t bear to impose the same fate to those who were born after that Person died.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry for Ruminas, but I thought that I have the chance\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm. After all, this world is survival of the fittest. No one will blame you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Why, why did you want to restored this land? Did you do it to save us?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahahaha! Don\u2019t misunderstand it! I just want to prove that I\u2019m stronger than you.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, I thought I would enrich this land to mend the mood of Ruminas.</p><br/><p>I never think that the range of the effect would also include the death desert area\u2015\u2015 It was a miscalculation!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu, fuhahahahaha! Even to the end you still pretending like that heh.</p><br/><p>Very well, I will not think this as a debt, Veldora!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. There\u2019s no lending and borrowing[2] between friends! Let\u2019s fight again. Oh well, I will also win next time though!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up, I\u2019m not eager enough to lose to a lizard for that many times!\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora and Dagruel laugh loudly looking at each other faces.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any ill feeling, both of them had a fresh expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell now, it\u2019s about time the effect of Fertile Paradox spreading.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo? How you procured the remaining energy?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s unlikely for my remaining energy to be enough to cover all of it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, since the angels are swarming the sky, I used them.</p><br/><p>Originally, the technique affects everyone, but I made it so it only affects the opponent with Probability Fluctuations.</p><br/><p>Kukuku, convenient isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s no need to select neatly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026You\u2019re an outrageous guy. No way, even my alive subordinates too\u2015\u2015!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHm? Ah, I leave them alone. If they are hostile after seeing the situation then I\u2019ll wipe them up.</p><br/><p>As the angel has no free will, this time I make the condition for the target to be \u201cThose who have hostile intent\u201d and \u201cThings without a will\u201d. Well, I will deal with them properly later.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u2026\u201d Dagruel consented so.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s Veldora, he might be able to do anything.</p><br/><p>(However, things without a will? That, isn\u2019t that means all of the structures would get destroyed?)</p><br/><p>Suddenly, such worry passed inside Dagruel\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>As for the heaven gate, it actually has a will.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Dagruel didn\u2019t worry about the condition of the gate, but thinking about the scope of affected area of the prismatic darkness, he confirmed this in a moment and it is clear that all of his territories will be included in the range.</p><br/><p>Well, they\u2019re all included because he understood that the purpose is to restore the land.</p><br/><p>(Oh well. Structures can be rebuild. I don\u2019t need to worry about it\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>Dagruel renews his feelings.</p><br/><p>But at the end,</p><br/><p>\u300cVeldora, is it okay if I ask you a request?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHm, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI want to ask you to give my message to my sons and subordinates.\u300d</p><br/><p>So he said to Veldora.</p><br/><p>Veldora in response,</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahahaha! You should tell them with your own mouth.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t I say there\u2019s no lending and borrowing?</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s for such thing, you will manage to do it somehow.</p><br/><p>Soon, the darkness will disperse.\u300d</p><br/><p>Answered so, he was smiling broadly.</p><br/><p>The prismatic darkness cleared up.</p><br/><p>The place that was a death desert area, a wasteland that spread as far as the eye can see.</p><br/><p>That place is now transformed to a land where greenery spread out all over.</p><br/><p>Vegetation grows in a terrific vigor, bring forth a fertile soil.</p><br/><p>In a flash, a vast woodlands was formed that won\u2019t inferior to Great Jura Forest.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, didn\u2019t it works a bit too fast?\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora mutters in small voice.</p><br/><p>Apparently, the change was more than he intended.</p><br/><p>Next to Veldora who grimaced uneasily is Dagruel who did his last speech.</p><br/><p>\u300cHear me! I assign Dagura as my successor.</p><br/><p>Ryura, Debra! Help Dagura, exerts your effort for the prosperity of the Giant race!</p><br/><p>And, the warriors of the Giant race! You all shall obey Dagura as your king.</p><br/><p>You all need to ascertain of what is correct with your own judgment together with the new king.</p><br/><p>The fate of the giant race hanging in your judgment.</p><br/><p>Running away is not allowed. At the dawn when I returned, if the giant race has perished \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>You guys understand?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYe, yes!! Of course, Father! I\u2019ll risk my own life to fulfilled my duty as the king!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe too will help elder brother, we\u2019ll promise that we will live up to father\u2019s expectations!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course!\u300d</p><br/><p>The three brothers who watching the fight between Veldora and Dagruel to the end were awake at the same time as the darkness disappears.</p><br/><p>And, as soon of their awakening giving no time to digest the content of the declaration, they stated the oath.</p><br/><p>The reason is that Dagruel emitted air like \u201cHesitation will not be allowed\u201d.</p><br/><p>And so\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300eWe all present here, in accordance with the new king, shall devote ourselves for the country!!\u300f</p><br/><p>With Dagruel\u2019s defeat, the elites of the Chain of Restrain Titan army understood Veldora\u2019s aid, they followed it without raising any objection.</p><br/><p>Seeing it with his own eyes, Dagruel nod satisfactorily.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s regrettable that I\u2019m unable to see the end of this great war, but it seems my time is no more.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s you guys, I\u2019ll believe that you all can choose the right way, unlike mine.</p><br/><p>I entrust it to you all in my absence! Well then, goodbye\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Dagruel was sucked into the ground and disappeared with that as his last words.</p><br/><p>He falls into a long sleep in this land, in order regenerate his own body.</p><br/><p>Thus, the invasion of Dagruel\u2019s army failed.</p><br/><p>The angels were sacrificed without one remaining.</p><br/><p>The allied forces of Rimuru and Ruminas had succeeded in defending this place.</p><br/><p>Thus\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>The defense of this territory succeeded, but the city was gone without any trace.</p><br/><p>As Dagruel feared, the city that\u2019s inorganic substance was spotlessly destroyed.</p><br/><p>Moreover, with the birth of a new Great Forest, it seems that it wouldn\u2019t be easy for the reconstruction of the city.</p><br/><p>Of course, that thing is the reason why a certain person was enraged\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, Veldora. What does this mean? Do you have an explanation for me?\u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas asked Veldora with a clear vein popping on her brow which hidden by her beautiful silver hair.</p><br/><p>She put a beautiful smile on her face, but her eyes are not laughing at all.</p><br/><p>Veldora instantly</p><br/><p>(Thi, this is impossible! My perfect plan to lose my infamy!?)</p><br/><p>Saving Ruminas from a crisis, moreover, changing Ruminas\u2019 territory into land with good harvests.</p><br/><p>It should be a perfect plan.</p><br/><p>And yet, there\u2019s an apparent questionable mood.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmmmmm\u2026\u2026 There is a reason that deeper than the ocean for this\u2026...</p><br/><p>I want to explain it, but I\u2019m busy. We will talk about it later!\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying so, Veldora soared to the sky.</p><br/><p>And at the speed exceeding the speed when he fought Dagruel, he left behind the surface.</p><br/><p>\u300cDamn it, he runs away again! I won\u2019t forgive him, THAT IDIOT LIZARD!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas\u2019 angry words didn\u2019t reached Veldora.</p><br/><p>[1] Forgot to mention this when it appears in past chapters, refers to those who have EP: 1m+.

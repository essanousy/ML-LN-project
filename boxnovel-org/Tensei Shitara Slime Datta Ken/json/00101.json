Smooth Plan</p><br/><p>We went to the last floor where Veldora will live and arranged the interior.</p><br/><p>I take out all of the furniture out from my stomach and set them in room cordoned off by blocks.</p><br/><p>Atmosphere is really important, so I can\u2019t let the public see it.</p><br/><p>I copied and prepared some items that Veldora likes.</p><br/><p>And after we finished decorating the room, we proceeded to the center of the 100 floor and had Veldora release his aura.</p><br/><p>Veldora released his aura carefully and managed to do so without an accident.</p><br/><p>The inner walls of the room were created out of ore.</p><br/><p>It going to turn into demonic steel soon after getting bathed with magic power after all, so it\u2019s a simple mod wall.</p><br/><p>This way, we can save a bit on costs.</p><br/><p>By the way, the first floor of this dungeon is a square room 250m wide.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the same size as 4 Tokyo Domes, but as you continued further down, the size got smaller.</p><br/><p>The dungeon was created this way so the aura could spread well.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s room is 100m2 wide.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s seems quite big, but if Veldora get into his real form, it actually quite small.</p><br/><p>It was created so it can be expanded if it\u2019s ever inconvenient.</p><br/><p>The dungeon is under Ramiris control, so it can be customized freely to some degree.</p><br/><p>The aura is seeping up to each floor as planned.</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s no wall to block the way, it fills the room without disturbance.</p><br/><p>All we have to do now is to wait until the monsters spawned.</p><br/><p>After Veldora turned back into his human form, we moved on to the next step.</p><br/><p>First, about traps</p><br/><p>Poisoned Arrow \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Arrows smeared with poison come flying out of nowhere</p><br/><p>Poison Swamp \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Swamp that is really poisonous. If you fall into one, you\u2019ll get poison damage and abnormal status</p><br/><p>Turning Tile/Mat \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Driving your sense of direction mad. Feel the importance of mapping!</p><br/><p>Moving Tile/Mat \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf A floor that moves all by it own. Really scary.</p><br/><p>Cutting Thread \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Pass by it without realizing, your head comes off. Combined with Moving Floor for brutal results</p><br/><p>Pitfall \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Rather than the damage dealt by falling down, what\u2019s awaiting you when you fall is scarier.</p><br/><p>False Treasure Box(Mimic) \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Great, a treasure box..? Too bad, it\u2019s ME!</p><br/><p>Laughing Treasure Box \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Great, a treasure box! Die laughing.</p><br/><p>Monster Room \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Hi there! Finally, a feast.</p><br/><p>Sealing Room \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Turn a fire on and\u2026..</p><br/><p>Darkness Floor \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf It\u2019s a common sense to bring a torch you know. If you don\u2019t have one, we could sell one for a high price, how about it?</p><br/><p>Low Ceiling Floor \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf I don\u2019t want to meet monster while crawling~</p><br/><p>Terrain Effect Floor \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf What the hell is this?! Why there\u2019s a volcano in a dungeon!</p><br/><p>I listed all of the trap I could think of.</p><br/><p>Almost all of them are possible.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just the Terrain Effect Floor is too difficult. Well, volcano is impossible as expected.</p><br/><p>I was imaging having blazing floor, freezing floor, or blizzard floor that makes traps from natural disasters, but\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u300cImpossible. I don\u2019t have the energy to maintain something like that!\u300d</p><br/><p>As expected, it\u2019s impossible.</p><br/><p>Well, I might\u2019ve asked for something really absurd.</p><br/><p>And when I was going to give up on that plan,</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you want me to tame a fire dragon or ice dragon from somewhere?\u300d</p><br/><p>I hear the voice of someone that shouldn\u2019t be there.</p><br/><p>As I turn around I could see silver haired twintail.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh\u2026..? Why are you here? Milim\u2026.\u300d</p><br/><p>100 floors underground.</p><br/><p>In the other word, in the last floor of the newly-built dungeon, a beautiful young demon lord is smiling with a complacent smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufun. Somehow I feel that you\u2019re doing something fun. To think you were courageous enough to exclude me\u300d</p><br/><p>She said while getting arrogant and arching her back to emphasize her pitiful chest.</p><br/><p>As usual, she\u2019s dressed all in black with dragon knuckles\u2013that are emitting a dim light and hardly fit\u2013on her hands.</p><br/><p>Still, as expected. She\u2019s really sensitive to this kind of conspiracy.</p><br/><p>No doubt, it\u2019s impossible to hide things from Milim.</p><br/><p>In the first place, it\u2019s impossible to reason with Milim.</p><br/><p>Just because she appeared here, there\u2019s no need to be surprised.</p><br/><p>Milim and Veldora glared at each other, but afterwards shaked hands and seemed friendly.</p><br/><p>If the two of them fight with each other, it\u2019ll be a serious matter.</p><br/><p>Thank goodness they have become friends.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry about that. I had no intention to leave you behind. I was going to invite you after it was done\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cReally? But it\u2019s more fun to participate from the get-go when doing something like this\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, that might be true. By the way, is your country all right?\u300d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s also a demon lord.</p><br/><p>Moreover after merging her territory with the former demon lords Frey and Karion\u2019s territory, it should have gotten rather big.</p><br/><p>Is it ok for her to play and walk around like me? (Hmm, me? I\u2019m good. Everyone is really excellent, so it\u2019s better that I don\u2019t disturb them)</p><br/><p>Upon hearing my question, she averted her gaze.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it\u2019s fine. See, I\u2019m really excellent after all\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>By no means have I come here by running away because I hate studying!\u300d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Frey or the other examined and summarize the country state of affair and tried to teach it to Milim.</p><br/><p>She hated it and ran away to this place. That\u2019s probably the real situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo way! I\u2019m going join no matter what!\u300d</p><br/><p>Before I say anything, she refused.</p><br/><p>As expected. Her intuition is sharp as usual.</p><br/><p>Well, whatever. I\u2019m not the one that\u2019s going to get scolded anyway.</p><br/><p>Rather than that,</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, I\u2019m not the one that\u2019s going to get yelled at, so let\u2019s put that matter aside.</p><br/><p>What you said before, taming a dragon? Is that possible?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUgh\u2026. I really will get scolded\u2026? No, but\u2026.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped. There\u2019s bound to be some danger when you venture out.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s possible to tame a dragon. If you want, should I tame one for you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOoh, can I rely on you? In that case what species are there?\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim fears getting scolded, just like a kid that skip her homework to go play.</p><br/><p>Well, it can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s the path she took.</p><br/><p>After overcoming her worried expression, Milim\u2019s mood changed easily as she teach us about dragons.</p><br/><p>Seems like Veldora had no interest in it at all.</p><br/><p>Ramiris is saying something like \u300cWhat are you doing coming to this place!\u300d just to get glared at by Milim and caught..</p><br/><p>From Milim\u2019s explanation, there are 4 types of dragons.</p><br/><p>Fire dragon, ice dragon, wind dragon, and earth dragon.</p><br/><p>There are some that gained special evolution or unique, but these are the only four types.</p><br/><p>As expected it\u2019s impossible to tame a dragon lord, but as long it\u2019s not a lord, it\u2019s possible to tame an adult one.</p><br/><p>With this, having an effect similar to terrain effect is possible.</p><br/><p>And so we\u2019ll have the dragons live on the lower floors.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t really know just how strong a dragon is, but practically every dragon is at least an A rank.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the level that could be defeated by 6 Holy Knights.</p><br/><p>An elemental dragon is bound to increase the difficulty. Thus \u2013 while being carefree, of course \u2013 I arrange the dragon floors.</p><br/><p>In order of strength, fire&gt;ice&gt;wind&gt;earth.</p><br/><p>Or so it would be if the dragon is young. The order might get changed it it\u2019s an old one. That is, the dragon that is able to exercise all of its power will arise victorious.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s the order from strength only and it became like that.</p><br/><p>And so,</p><br/><p>99th floor is Flame Hell Floor Being covered in high temperature flame, the last gateway. Heat-resistant equipment is needed. The one that waiting before it is!?</p><br/><p>98th floor is Ice Hell Floor. If you stop, you die. Can you endure it with cold-resistant equipment?</p><br/><p>97th floor is Lighting Floor. The thread of lighting falling down from the sky. Whether you can break through this floor or not depend on your luck!</p><br/><p>96th floor is Tremor Floor. As to ridicule the one that managed to come this far, a fiendish earthquake will befall you. Feel the wrath of the dragon!</p><br/><p>And so the super hard terrain floors have been created.</p><br/><p>The dragons could use the aura that Veldora released as food, so they could live here with no problem .</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to tamper with these floors. Just let the dragons that Milim tamed make a nest here and it\u2019ll be fine.</p><br/><p>Next, create a safe zone every 10 floors.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s a boss room before each, so they could only access it after they defeated the boss.</p><br/><p>There, they would be able to purchase magic stones, sell drops, and buy potions at very high prices.</p><br/><p>Building a tavern or a restaurant might be a good idea, but wouldn\u2019t they just exit the dungeon if they wanted a break?</p><br/><p>Well, I\u2019ll decide on that as things go.</p><br/><p>The first floor difficulties is for testing only. So any beginner could finish it.</p><br/><p>The roads are wide, so getting lost is unlikely.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, 250m in width is considerable. It\u2019s going to be a floor that makes you walk a lot without any result/income.</p><br/><p>From then on, starting with the 2nd floor it\u2019s not that easy.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s time for the traps.</p><br/><p>Even though I say it won\u2019t be easy, in reality there isn\u2019t a single brutal trap up until the tenth floor, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll proceed without any major difficulties.</p><br/><p>Immediately facing a death trap would dissuade people from continuing, so it\u2019s out of the question.</p><br/><p>In this manner, while arguing about this and that, the four of us proceeded to arrange every floor.</p><br/><p>And thus, after three days, we are almost done fine-tuning it.</p><br/><p>We nod to each other with smiles on our faces, leaving the dungeon with a feeling of accomplishment.</p><br/><p>\u203bNeedless to say, the dungeon is filled with monster by the next time we went there.</p><br/><p>Milim went out to tame the dragons.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t particularly mind the monsters getting destroyed, but that\u2019s a no-no for the dragons.</p><br/><p>We assigned all the tamed dragons as Ramiris\u2019 subordinates.</p><br/><p>Get this, inside Ramiris\u2019 \u300eDungeon Creation\u300fher subordinates are immortal.</p><br/><p>If Ramiris got killed, she\u2019ll disappear, but the subordinates could respawn at the recorded spot.</p><br/><p>This is the reason why she wanted Beretta so much.</p><br/><p>Even if Ramiris doesn\u2019t have any power, inside the dungeon, Ramiris troops are undefeatable.</p><br/><p>For Ramiris who doesn\u2019t have any subordinates, it just a meaningless invincible skill.</p><br/><p>Beretta himself serves us tea without any complaint busily fulfills a maid\u2019s function.</p><br/><p>Since it seems that Beretta consents, working for Ramiris might not be so bad.</p><br/><p>\u300cWith this, I finally gain real subordinates\u2026..!\u300d</p><br/><p>Said Ramiris clearly emotional.</p><br/><p>She might be really lonely. So while looking at Beretta,</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, Beretta. Do you want to be Ramiris permanent servant?\u300d</p><br/><p>I ask Beretta.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been thinking of this for a while. If Beretta wants it, I\u2019ll let him change it\u2019s loyalty.</p><br/><p>If Beretta didn\u2019t want to, I\u2019ll prepare new subordinate for Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Beretta answered,</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it all right? Then I\u2019ll swear my allegiance to Ramiris-sama, as her servant\u300d</p><br/><p>He said without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it good, Ramiris. You\u2019re unexpectedly loved.</p><br/><p>I nodded,</p><br/><p>\u300cFine. Well, then Beretta. From now on, you shall work under Ramiris!\u300d</p><br/><p>I declared, lifting the master lock and transferring it to Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Who\u2019s of course clearly dumbfounded by what has just occurred.</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! Thank you very much for everything up until now. I won\u2019t forget the favour of letting me be born into this world\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry about me. From now on, work hard and protect Ramiris\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! Even at the cost of my life!\u300d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s believe him. If it\u2019s Beretta, I don\u2019t have to worry.</p><br/><p>The transfer concluded without any problem. From now on, I\u2019ll only be the sub-master.</p><br/><p>As long as nothing happens to Ramiris, Beretta will only listen to Ramiris command.</p><br/><p>Ramiris who finally managed to understand the situation pranced around in delight.</p><br/><p>She might be really delighted.</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>Controlling the dragons inside the dungeon all by herself might be too difficult.</p><br/><p>So if Beretta is there when she needs him, there will be no problem.</p><br/><p>It also seems like Beretta doesn\u2019t want to hand over the position as the first servant since Beretta has been serving her for a while.</p><br/><p>Veldora and I start to get fed up while look at the prancing Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Being a formal master-servant relationship, Beretta became an immortal inside this dungeon.</p><br/><p>Servant can only revive at a previously set location, but there are no revival limits.</p><br/><p>With a sufficient number of troops, Ramiris\u2019 ability is terrifying.</p><br/><p>And it\u2019s because she\u2019s the owner, that this ability has yet to see the light of day.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not going to tell her, but depending on it\u2019s use it could easily sway any battle.</p><br/><p>Even now, having Beretta with unlimited rebirths is too overpowered.</p><br/><p>Now, we\u2019re also adding Milim\u2019s dragons.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a chance that this kid will soon have an unbelievably potent power in her hands.</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019s Ramiris after all. There won\u2019t be any problem.</p><br/><p>This lovable fairy is just a small lonely kid.</p><br/><p>The revival item called bracelet of revival is also recognized by Ramiris, so anyone who wears it will not die.</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019ll have no effect outside this dungeon.</p><br/><p>If this thing isn\u2019t explained completely, there\u2019s a possibilities of misunderstandings.</p><br/><p>And then while confirming various things, the dungeon is getting shaped steadily.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s this airtight room for? is this also a trap?\u300d</p><br/><p>To that question,</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you suddenly enter into a room without air, you\u2019ll fall from not being able to breath. At worst\u2013die.</p><br/><p>You have to be careful in front of any room. This is an ironclad rule.</p><br/><p>Examine the poison inside the room, measure the concentration of air. If you can\u2019t do at least this much, you won\u2019t be able to last long.</p><br/><p>At worst, you have to use wind magic for ventilation\u300d</p><br/><p>I answered, seems like she didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I know that this is an atrocious trap.</p><br/><p>You\u2026. I\u2019ve been thinking this for a while, but you\u2019re a terrifying guy.</p><br/><p>But, reliable. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to think of this kind of trap all by myself\u2026.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris said while looking at the traps with admiration.</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s what she thinks of me. Well, I liked games in my previous world, so it\u2019s a trap that I\u2019ve gotten used to.</p><br/><p>If you tell me to clear it in real life, though, I beg to differ.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s almost no one unaffected by poison and having no need to breathe like us.</p><br/><p>I think it\u2019s going to be a brutal dungeon.</p><br/><p>The completed masterpiece can hardly be described with only \u201cbrutal\u201d.</p><br/><p>(Well, if you add monster to those kinds of vicious traps, of course it\u2019s going to be fiendish)</p><br/><p>I feel like I heard a voice, but it\u2019s probably just my imagination.</p><br/><p>However, I bet I\u2019ll hear it again soon enough.</p><br/><p>After finishing the creation of the dungeon, I return to city.</p><br/><p>Veldora and Ramiris will probably happily finish the rest by themselves.</p><br/><p>They were very interested in watching me set up the traps..</p><br/><p>They also asked to allow them to set one up, but I refused\u2013primarily due to wanting to avoid a sick joke before the tenth floor.</p><br/><p>Otherwise the customer (adventurers) will have their hearts or minds broken and will be unable to proceed.</p><br/><p>However, I did decide to leave the rest to them on the condition that the floor must be passable.</p><br/><p>95th and 94th floors will probably end up being nonsensical floors, but it\u2019s ok.</p><br/><p>91st to 93rd floors are untouched. Milim might want to do one, so we\u2019ll set it up later.</p><br/><p>And so, I leave the rest to them. It\u2019s good to see them enjoy themselves this much.</p><br/><p>By the time I got back to the city, Myormiles had arrived.</p><br/><p>He must have prepared himself with a great haste. His arrival is way faster then what I had planned.</p><br/><p>I led him to the mansion I\u2019ve prepared beforehand and leave the rest to Rigurdo.</p><br/><p>I say my thanks to Myormiles and briefed him on the new happenings.</p><br/><p>I explained the location of the arena and the plans for building a tavern town there.</p><br/><p>I also told him about the plan to attract adventurer with the newly built dungeon.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo and Myormiles were shocked to hear that and it turned into quite a discussion.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo wanted to discuss the type of people who will come here from now on.</p><br/><p>Myormiles discussed the opening of the arena and the dungeon.</p><br/><p>After listening to their opinions, we proceeded to discuss the necessary resources.</p><br/><p>They quickly became good friends.</p><br/><p>I told Rigurdo to treat Myormiles as the official leader of the business division.</p><br/><p>I also told him that Myormiles will get a second post as the leader of publicizing.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo nodded, and contacted the individuals that would benefit said divisions.</p><br/><p>Thus preparation continue.</p><br/><p>Myormiles was accepted as the resident of Tempest easily.</p><br/><p>I only introduced him and let the other introduce themselves.</p><br/><p>The flow was so smooth it left me surprised.</p><br/><p>Anyways, after seeing Myormiles\u2019 work ethic, they can\u2019t have any complaints left.</p><br/><p>Myormiles evinced that he\u2019s able to grasp the abilities of the subordinates that were assigned to him.</p><br/><p>And, including his entourage, he assigned jobs to each member individually.</p><br/><p>Seeing a hierarchy completed in a blink of an eye is rather refreshing.</p><br/><p>Myormiles is really lively for being responsible for two divisions.</p><br/><p>Now, as for the invitations to various leaders and figureheads.</p><br/><p>Excluding the person I personally know, we send the invitation under Myormiles\u2019 name.</p><br/><p>Influential nobles and wealthy merchant of each town.</p><br/><p>His progress is so quick that you\u2019d think he had been doing this his whole life.</p><br/><p>We also drafted up procedure and costs for the upcoming events.</p><br/><p>Not just the planning and management, but things are producing smoothly on all fronts.</p><br/><p>Looks like I chose the right person.</p><br/><p>Perhaps out of all the ideas I\u2019ve thus implemented, choosing Myormiles was the best.</p><br/><p>If he were not here, the possibility of things going awry is high.</p><br/><p>With just our power, we couldn\u2019t have performed this well.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m really fortunate to be able to meet good people.</p><br/><p>Myormiles also feel charmed by the food, environment, and comfort of this town.</p><br/><p>\u300cImpossible\u2026. This is impossible! It\u2019s even more comfortable compared to the royal capital!\u300d</p><br/><p>He kept saying until it basically became his catchphrase.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m glad that he liked it.</p><br/><p>Then again, Myormiles reaction is the primary evidence that everything will be fine.</p><br/><p>And Myormiles himself knows it.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, there\u2019s no way this plan is going to fail.</p><br/><p>With everything as it is, anyone could make it succeed!\u300d</p><br/><p>Myormiles said. filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>I think anyone is a bit too much, but I\u2019m happy to hear him say that.</p><br/><p>And as the preparations progress, unfamiliar people start coming to the town.</p><br/><p>I feel a heated season approaching.</p><br/><p>And it is nigh upon us!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

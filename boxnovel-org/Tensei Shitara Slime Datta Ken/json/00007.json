Listen. This was just practice\u2013a temporary solution. The resolution was wrong so the quality is bad.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: That\u2019s what they all say!</p><br/><p>Clown: Okay, here\u2019s the truth\u2026 the drawing tablet broke\u2026 so until I fix it, just hang in there!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Promise?</p><br/><p>Clown: Absolutely!!!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Very well\u2026</p><br/><p>Clown: Oh and speaking of hanging, I\u2019ve heard a politician say this: \u201cI think they should bring back hanging and we should watch it live on TV and call it Noose at 10\u201d!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: I\u2019ll take you up on that\u2026</p><br/><p>Clown: No, wait!!!</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Empowerment Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 07 \u2013 First Battle</p><br/><p>A path leading out of from the underground lake.</p><br/><p>It was a single tunnel.</p><br/><p>With a *boyo boyo*, I ascend the path.</p><br/><p>Moving around is actually more pleasant than you\u2019d expect.</p><br/><p>Even places that light fails to reach are perfectly visible to [Magic Perception].</p><br/><p>I would more around slowly\u2013checking every step\u2013when I was blind; and, slimes aren\u2019t that fast to begin with.</p><br/><p>Now, I normally move at a walking pace, but can also run. Nor do I get tired.</p><br/><p>But, since I don\u2019t have any reason to hurry, I move at a moderate pace.</p><br/><p>I swear this is not the result of a trauma from the first time I ran and fell into the lake!</p><br/><p>A short while after, a giant gate had appeared before my eyes.</p><br/><p>A human made structure inside the cave.</p><br/><p>Nothing that strange about it. But, that\u2019s because this development is common in RPGs.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s normal to have a door in front of the boss\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 how should I get it open?</p><br/><p>Should I cut it with the [Water Blade]?</p><br/><p>When I though that,</p><br/><p>Gigigiiiiiii!!!</p><br/><p>With a creaking noise, the door is opening.</p><br/><p>A little flustered, I hid by the edge of the path, and observed the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt finally opened, huh. Lock fell apart and the doors rusted\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, that\u2019s only to be expected. Don\u2019t they say that no one entered here in 300 years?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNot on record, at least. But more importantly, are we really going to be fine? We won\u2019t be attacked suddenly, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGahahaha! Don\u2019t worry. He might have been unrivaled 300 years ago, but times have changed. I mean, ain\u2019t he just a big lizard! I\u2019ve subjugated Basilisks by myself. Leave it to me!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAbout that, I\u2019ve wondered for a while, but that\u2019s a lie, isn\u2019t it? Basilisks are ranked B+, right? Solo subjugation would be impossible for Cabal-san, wouldn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFool! I am a B rank myself! They are just big lizards; no trouble at all!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, okay, I got it, so would you please not let your guard down? Well, if it comes down to it, I\u2019ll just escape using \u201cForced Withdrawal\u201d\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGuys, I got the extent of your friendship, so could you please be quiet? You\u2019ll blow my \u201cCamouflage Skill\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, a boisterous trio had entered.</p><br/><p>I wonder why\u2026</p><br/><p>Actually\u2026 why do I understand their words?</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cSolution. In cases where intentions are vocalized, [Magic Perception] converts them to appropriate words and transmits them to the brain.\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t talk to them, but at least I can understand them.</p><br/><p>Thank goodness. I had always been bad with English.</p><br/><p>I think that if you live in Japan there should be no need to study foreign languages.</p><br/><p>Those who plan to go abroad can struggle by themselves.</p><br/><p>But that excuse won\u2019t work here. I\u2019ll probably have to learn eventually.</p><br/><p>Well, that matter can rest for now.</p><br/><p>What should I do?</p><br/><p>This dilemma is worse than the previous one\u2013how to open the door.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what they came to do\u2026 but they seem like adventurers.</p><br/><p>Did they come searching for treasures and stuff?</p><br/><p>They are the first humans I meet in this world. sort of want to go and greet them.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 if a mute monster slime (a.k.a I) were to go out there\u2026</p><br/><p>I\u2019d be killed without questions.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s wait for now.</p><br/><p>Meeting humans will have to wait until I can talk.</p><br/><p>For now, I observed this situation in hiding.</p><br/><p>After the skinny man had done something, the appearance of the three has dimmer. But, I can still see them.</p><br/><p>Did he call this\u2026 camouflage?</p><br/><p>Probably a type of skill.</p><br/><p>Is he just trying to peek? What an outrageous guy\u2026 Does he even know why they came here?</p><br/><p>Probably should get to know him later.</p><br/><p>When the three had finally left, I started moving again.</p><br/><p>Nothing to worry about.</p><br/><p>Not like I won\u2019t meet people anymore.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll move while checking every step. As people have always said, \u201chaste makes waste\u201d.</p><br/><p>Leaving these matters for later, I quickly went through the gate in case the three had returned.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>A little while past the gates the path diverged and became rather complex.</p><br/><p>I wonder which way leads to the surface?</p><br/><p>Though even if I thought about it, there\u2019s no way for me to know.</p><br/><p>I chose a path and went down it.</p><br/><p>*Chiro chirori!*</p><br/><p>Our eyes met.</p><br/><p>Just a bit above the ground\u2026 in front of my eyes, there was a giant serpent.</p><br/><p>Like the past world\u2019s snakes, you could consider it cute. It was harder, covered in scales, and pitch black in color.</p><br/><p>Like a frog in front of snake? Nope, I am a slime, not a frog.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s pretend I\u2019m air. It would be best, though, if it doesn\u2019t notice me.</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s just try to slither away.</p><br/><p>*Kisha\u2013!!!*</p><br/><p>I was threatened.</p><br/><p>No good. I won\u2019t let you go! Or so it would probably say if I could hear it.</p><br/><p>A fight, huh\u2026!</p><br/><p>I have a secret skill that I gained from a week\u2019s long practice!</p><br/><p>But even so\u2026 you\u2019ve got to be resolved to die if you want to fight this beast.</p><br/><p>To summarize, I\u2019m pretty darn scared!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t panic. If I think hard enough, I can imagine something far scarier.</p><br/><p>Yes, Veldora. Let\u2019s compare it to that dragon.</p><br/><p>Oh? Doesn\u2019t seem that scary now.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t I do this?</p><br/><p>After calming myself, I began quietly observing the serpent.</p><br/><p>The snake seems to have let its guard down, thinking I was so afraid I that I couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Probably planning on how it will cook me.</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>Well then, let\u2019s not hold back either\u2026</p><br/><p>*Bishun!*</p><br/><p>Without hesitation I fired a \u201cwater blade\u201d at the serpent\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>*Zuban!!! Hyuuuun, dosu. Gorogoro\u2026 zun.*</p><br/><p>It was but a moment.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.</p><br/><p>Without even a hint of resistance the \u201cwater blade\u201d beheaded the serpent.</p><br/><p>I could only gulp; up until a second ago, there was an ominous sneak right there.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 is even more powerful than I had thought.</p><br/><p>Had I been forced to use it on the adventures, it would end gory. Good thing my first enemy was a monster.</p><br/><p>Oh and by the way, my stomach is currently occupied at 30%: Veldora 15%, Water 10%, Medicine and other crap 2%, metals and resources 3%.</p><br/><p>\u201cWater Bullet\u201d uses less than a cup of water (and I can regulate the size\u2013with the intention of increasing it, of course).</p><br/><p>Thus even if I fire thousands of these, I won\u2019t have to worry about the amount left.</p><br/><p>This just might be better than magic.</p><br/><p>If monsters come out, let\u2019s meet them with a \u201cwater blade\u201d.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Now, about this snake.</p><br/><p>If I eat and analyze it, would I steal its powers?</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s try it.</p><br/><p>The result\u2026</p><br/><p>Inherent skill [Heat Detection]\u2026 the ability to see nearby heat sources. Furthermore, camouflage skills are nullified.</p><br/><p>Inherent skill [Noxious Mist Breath]\u2026 the ability to release a powerful toxic (corrosive) breath. Released at 120 degrees for a distance of 7 meters.</p><br/><p>(TL Note: 22 feet)</p><br/><p>Along with these two skills, I could also mimic the snake.</p><br/><p>The poison\u2019s main effect seems to be corrosive damage (damage to both equipment and flesh). Would be pretty effective against normal adventurers, eh?</p><br/><p>Though with this world\u2019s magic, it just might be an easy win.</p><br/><p>And so I spent some time analyzing the snake\u2019s skills.</p><br/><p>Best to increase my hand while I can.</p><br/><p>Things I\u2019ve confirmed:</p><br/><p>1. I\u2019ve gained the ability to transform into the snake.</p><br/><p>2. I can use the acquired skills even without transforming. But, their strength decreases.</p><br/><p>Those two things.</p><br/><p>If I had to explain them,</p><br/><p>1. \u2026 I can stock up on the bodies of monsters I ate and analyzed.</p><br/><p>My body had repaired the section I previously damaged, but it kind of has the feel of stitches\u2026 made with cells.</p><br/><p>2. \u2026 Inherent skills are skills specific to that monster race. Similar to my [Dissolve, Absorb, and Regenerate].</p><br/><p>Regarding the skill, if I am not transformed into the appropriate monster, I cannot use it with 100% effectiveness.</p><br/><p>However, there also skills like [Heat Detection], which I can make completely my own.</p><br/><p>To summarize, it\u2019s like this.</p><br/><p>I totally dig [Predator].</p><br/><p>It\u2019s another skill which is super useful.</p><br/><p>3 days have passed since I fought the snake.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m still inside the cavern.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t feel cold, but it\u2019s probably below freezing in here.</p><br/><p>Sunlight doesn\u2019t reach here at all.</p><br/><p>And so, I kept worrying over one fear.</p><br/><p>I know, I know.. there\u2019s no way it\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>But no matter what, I just couldn\u2019t get it out of my head.</p><br/><p>Yeah\u2026 what if\u2026</p><br/><p>I am lost?</p><br/><p>No, no, there\u2019s no way.</p><br/><p>I mean\u2026 right? Who\u2019s heard of someone getting lost in the beginner\u2019s cave?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this supposed to be the easiest part?</p><br/><p>Besides, even those three adventurers got this far without being lost.</p><br/><p>I should be fine. It\u2019s probably just a long path.</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019s probably a good thing I was reborn as a slime.</p><br/><p>Had I come here as a normal \u201cWorld Traveler\u201d, I\u2019d definitely collapse from hunger by now.</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that I\u2019d be thankful for being a slime.</p><br/><p>However, not knowing the way is troubling.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t there like a map of this place or something?</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cSolution. Should I display the current location? [YES]/[NO]?\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>Replay the current narration..?</p><br/><p>Just couldn\u2019t help making a pun.</p><br/><p>But seriously, what the hell! Let me know sooner if I have such a useful ability!!!</p><br/><p>Absolutely [YES]!</p><br/><p>Curse you auto-mapping!</p><br/><p>I also had a time when I thought that.</p><br/><p>Back in old games, you\u2019d sit down with a pencil and a piece of paper, and record every step to get to the goal.</p><br/><p>It was fun to plan every step.</p><br/><p>However, many people began relying on game guides, and eventually mapping became a standard game feature.</p><br/><p>No more pleasure of the hunt\u2026</p><br/><p>Moreover, had you gotten used to that feature once, you can never go back again.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s also true that without this feature, you\u2019d be stuck in most recent games.</p><br/><p>Anyways, let\u2019s put this useful skill to use.</p><br/><p>I look at the map displayed in my head.</p><br/><p>This has got to be some mistake\u2026 I\u2019ve been walking in circles.</p><br/><p>For me, who has compiled game guides before, to have been lost?! Impossible!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Definitely possible.</p><br/><p>According to the map, I\u2019ve entered previously unexplored regions.</p><br/><p>So, I\u2019ve spent three days looking at the world no one has seen before.</p><br/><p>Fufufu.</p><br/><p>To have mislead me\u2026 the dungeon is a worthy opponent!</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s pointlessly praise the dungeon.</p><br/><p>And don\u2019t even begin to think that I have no sense of direction!</p><br/><p>Is the entrance close by?</p><br/><p>There is various moss and weed growing around here.</p><br/><p>The light reaches from somewhere, bathing the grass in light and color.</p><br/><p>So it must be day.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve fought many battles to come this far.</p><br/><p>A centipede monster (Evil centipede: rank B+)</p><br/><p>Big, black spider (Black spider: rank B)</p><br/><p>Vampire bat (Giant Bat: Rank C+)</p><br/><p>Carapace Lizard (Ammosaurus: rank B-)</p><br/><p>Those are the four species I encountered.</p><br/><p>There was that one serpent, but I haven\u2019t seen another.</p><br/><p>They were all powerful foes.</p><br/><p>Defeated with one \u201cWater Blade\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, the bat evaded it a few times, and the shooting angle was bad for the centipede.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t relax just yet.</p><br/><p>For example, the centipede erased its presence and attacked from behind.</p><br/><p>Luckily, that kind of attack wouldn\u2019t work on someone with [Magic Perception] and [Heat Detection].</p><br/><p>So I shot out a few water blades from my back.</p><br/><p>The big spider was pretty dangerous.</p><br/><p>In the first place, I\u2019m no good with spiders.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a psychological thing. Just a sight of one makes me want to cower.</p><br/><p>But, maybe due to my heart become stronger through reincarnation, I somehow managed to fight without running away.</p><br/><p>My bad, but I\u2019m going full force! With that thought, I cut it up with five water blades.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an opponent I wanted to look at, after all.</p><br/><p>And of course, I ate them all.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s survival of the fittest in this world. If you lose, you get eaten.</p><br/><p>And well, I did hesitate to eat the centipede and the spider.</p><br/><p>But I did do my best.</p><br/><p>But, if a cockroach monster exists, I\u2019ll absolutely run away without eating it.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s these wonderful words in this world: he who fights and runs away will live to see another day.</p><br/><p>Here\u2019s the skills I got as a result,</p><br/><p>Centipede monster [Paralysis Breath]</p><br/><p>Big spider [Sticky Thread, Steel Thread]</p><br/><p>Vampire Bat [Vampirism, Ultrasound Waves]</p><br/><p>Carapace Lizard [Body Armor]</p><br/><p>And so, having gotten my hands on new powers, I successfully left the cave.</p><br/><p>For the first time since being reborn, I was bathed in the light of the sun.</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: the Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Titles: None</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Skills: Unique Skill [Great Sage], Unique Skill [Predator], Slime-Specific Skills [Dissolve, Absorb, Regenerate], Extra Skill [Water Manipulation], Extra Skill [Magic Perception], Acquired Skill\u2013Serpent [Heat Detection, Noxious Breath], etc.</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance, Physical Attack Resistance, Pain Resistance, Electricity Resistance, Paralysis Resistance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

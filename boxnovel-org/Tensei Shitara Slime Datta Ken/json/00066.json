Chance Meeting</p><br/><p>After sending Grucius back to Tempest, I tried to return myself but the skill wouldn\u2019t activate.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>Grucius did just disappear in front of me a second ago, though\u2026</p><br/><p>These questions,</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. You are inside a wide-range barrier. Transfer skills are sealed.\u226b</p><br/><p>were answered by the\u300eGreat Sage\u300f.</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m getting a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>A feeling of impending doom that I have never felt before.</p><br/><p>When Milim invaded, I did not feel any killing intent from her; so I was not that worried. But this time, all my senses are sounding the alarm.</p><br/><p>Have I fallen into a trap?</p><br/><p>I tried calling for Ranga from within my shadow, but he did not respond.</p><br/><p>Seems like this barrier has completely isolated me from the outside world.</p><br/><p>So it seems that I can neither call for aid nor escape.</p><br/><p>The feeling of dread led to me to set up some things as insurance. At least I can still use my skills\u2026</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. You are inside a wide-range barrier. All magic energy manipulation abilities have been sealed.\u226b</p><br/><p>What?!</p><br/><p>That basically includes every type of magic that I use; even flame and lightning abilities have been sealed.</p><br/><p>Moreover,\u300eSteel Thread\u300fand thread manipulation abilities have also been sealed.</p><br/><p>So instead of thinking that I wandered into somebody\u2019s hunting ground, I am the one who is being hunted?</p><br/><p>They permitted Grucius departure in order not to fight both of us at once. Had I decided to leave first, though, they might not have waited.</p><br/><p>In that case, they can probably sense the flow of my magic.</p><br/><p>What could they be planning?</p><br/><p>I take stance in response to a relentless killing intent, and wait for the enemy to appear. I am of course trying to dispel the barrier, but to do that I need the\u300eGreat Sage\u300fto analyze it first.</p><br/><p>However, these long range barriers require more time to be analyzed.</p><br/><p>In other words, I\u2019m in a pinch.</p><br/><p>This was the first time I felt my heart beat faster out of anxiety.</p><br/><p>It was anxiety that I have never felt since coming into the world.</p><br/><p>That could have been the result of me changing into the slime, but chances are, it\u2019s mostly due to the predictive abilities of the\u300eGreat Sage\u300f.</p><br/><p>Before I undertake anything, it can estimate the chances of me succeeding.</p><br/><p>Which is why I have been able to face strong opponents fearlessly. Though they were strong, I could predict the outcome.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, even facing certain defeat I did not feel anxious.</p><br/><p>If I can\u2019t win, I should just run away. If I can\u2019t run away, let\u2019s at least punch them once.</p><br/><p>But none of that mattered in this case. Here, without knowing my opponent\u2019s strength, I cannot predict the outcome.</p><br/><p>However, I do feel their killing intent.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know whether I can win, and I cannot run away. Nor do I know how many enemies I am facing.</p><br/><p>A few humans would be needed to set up a barrier this large.</p><br/><p>However, \u300eHeat Perception\u300fis detecting only a single body approaching;\u300eMagic Perception\u300fis not responding.</p><br/><p>So if I turned into a slime, I would be essentially blind.</p><br/><p>In other words, I have lost that amazing perceptive ability and cannot view the entire battlefield at once.</p><br/><p>The moment I was caught in this barrier, my chances of winning have fallen significantly.</p><br/><p>However, to go out of one\u2019s way to seal an opponent\u2019s abilities\u2026</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s possible to fight like this. Moreover, the enemy doesn\u2019t even realize that they have been separated from the outside world.</p><br/><p>Clearly the work of someone who professionally hunts monsters.</p><br/><p>Chances are, the barrier is at least 4 kilometers wide. It\u2019s boundary is completely outside of my sight.</p><br/><p>Their meticulousness is terrifying.</p><br/><p>(Just who would do this, and why are they hunting me?)</p><br/><p>When I thought that,</p><br/><p>\u300cPleased to meet you, should I say? Though I won\u2019t know you for long\u300d</p><br/><p>A single person walking towards me threw such words at me.</p><br/><p>I thought so for a while now, but I feel like I\u2019ve seen her somewhere.</p><br/><p>A nostalgic feeling when looking at her.</p><br/><p>She has beautiful, glossy black hair at about shoulder height, with the left side swept back and the right almost covering her eye.</p><br/><p>She wears small round glasses, which could be described as her defining characteristic.</p><br/><p>I wonder if she wears them out of fashion, since her eyes don\u2019t seem particularly bad.</p><br/><p>She wears dark clothing that\u2019s easy to move around. However, by the quality of it, the clothing is clearly made for ceremonial occasions. Rather than a skirt, she wears pants.</p><br/><p>Her body is bound by a robe, the kind the clergy wear, dyed black.</p><br/><p>Though I am a fan of black myself, hers is an unnatural fascination with the color.</p><br/><p>Her eyes, cold and cruel, display profound wisdom.</p><br/><p>Other than the cold glare, she can only be described as beautiful</p><br/><p>\u300cPleased to meet you, but do you have some business with me?</p><br/><p>My name is Rimuru; could there be some misunderstanding here?\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably pointless, but no harm in trying.</p><br/><p>She clearly has targeted me. There\u2019s no way she made a mistake.</p><br/><p>But even so, I\u2019d rather not get killed because of a misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course not, there is no mistake here.</p><br/><p>Master of the Monster\u2019s City. You know, it\u2019s a bother.</p><br/><p>So I decided to crush it.</p><br/><p>Which is why your return would be a great inconvenience.</p><br/><p>You understand, don\u2019t you?\u300d</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation and as if bored, she explained herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see!\u201d Isn\u2019t something I can just say here.</p><br/><p>But how does she know that I rule over Tempest?</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy do you call me a monster, and some monsters\u2019 city lord?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m just a normal adventurer, can\u2019t you see?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? Are you playing dumb?</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s no use. I have my sources.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t tell you who, of course, but this much I\u2019m certain about.</p><br/><p>There are many \u201ceyes\u201d in the Royal Capital. You should be more prudent with your secrets.\u300d</p><br/><p>An informant, she says?</p><br/><p>I have no idea who it could be. I would have noticed if I were being followed and I was careful with my contacts.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t get it. Well, I do understand that she\u2019s out to kill me, though.</p><br/><p>This is really bad.</p><br/><p>She is armed with a rapier hanging on her hip.</p><br/><p>She isn\u2019t wearing armor and appears rather carefree.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t feel the presence of anyone else around, seems like the people who created the barrier will not be joining the fight.</p><br/><p>They planned a certain-kill trap but only sent one person?</p><br/><p>Or does that mean that she\u2019s simply that powerful?</p><br/><p>But this is not the time to be pondering these things. Tempest might be getting attacked this very moment.</p><br/><p>After raising an army, it would take them about a week to reach the city.</p><br/><p>How many days did it take Grucius to travel from Farmas Kingdom to Ingrasia Kingdom?</p><br/><p>If he was running without rest, I\u2019d say about three days.</p><br/><p>The plan was for me to return immediately, but, as things stand, I can only lament my ignorance.</p><br/><p>All I know is that I don\u2019t have the time to fool around.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeems that even if I claimed that you\u2019ve got the wrong person you won\u2019t trust me, will you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNope. After all, I\u2019ve heard that the master of the monsters is named \u201cRimuru\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, is that so\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She got me. To think that she has even heard of my name.</p><br/><p>\u300cCan we start now?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019d prefer not to, but can I at least hear your name?\u300d</p><br/><p>I said to her, who was drawing her rapier.</p><br/><p>The beauty tilted her neck, and said</p><br/><p>\u300cI haven\u2019t told you, huh. Didn\u2019t really care, so I forgot.</p><br/><p>In that case, one more time.</p><br/><p>I am the \u201cEmperor\u2019s Personal Knights Battalion\u201d Knights Captain.</p><br/><p>Sakaguchi Hinata is the name.</p><br/><p>Our acquaintanceship shall be short, and not a pleasant one.\u300d</p><br/><p>She drew the rapier.</p><br/><p>Seven jewels adorned the hilt of her silver blade.</p><br/><p>Crimson magic enveloped it. A Magic sword, it seems.</p><br/><p>But to think that she is Sakaguchi Hinata\u2026</p><br/><p>I heard that she was the ultimate pragmatist who doesn\u2019t like to follow through.</p><br/><p>That seems to be a misconception. She learned about me, and everything regarding my city.</p><br/><p>But, more importantly.</p><br/><p>I still have to \u201cthank\u201d her for having messed with the kids.</p><br/><p>Thank goodness she\u2019s intending to fight. I can mercilessly crush her.</p><br/><p>But just for the sake of time, if I can negotiate out of this, I will.</p><br/><p>So while drawing my sword,</p><br/><p>\u300cHinata, you say? Wait a second, I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know what a monster could possibly mean to tell me, but I\u2019m not planning to listen.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, I said. You\u2019re Japanese, and so am I. Shizu-san has asked me to look\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI know. That you killed Shizu-sensei. So this is revenge.</p><br/><p>Besides, a monster being a Japanese? What a ridiculous thing you say, don\u2019t try to make me laugh\u300d</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019ll believe me.</p><br/><p>Right! I thought of a way and,</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve been telling you: I\u2019m Japanese! I died over there and reincarnated as a slime in this world!\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, in Japanese.</p><br/><p>Surprise colored her face.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow skillful\u2026 where have you learned those words?</p><br/><p>But, that\u2019s not how this works. The chance of that occurring is astronomically low.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the chance that such a person is talking to me right now on top of that makes it impossible.</p><br/><p>In other words, there\u2019s no need to even consider your words.\u300d</p><br/><p>She completely disregards anything I\u2019ll say.</p><br/><p>I had thought she may believe if a monster suddenly starts speaking Japanese, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cSo you are planning to fight no matter what, huh?</p><br/><p>Well, then let me pay you back for messing with the kids!</p><br/><p>And besides, do you think that you\u2019ll be enough to defeat me?\u300d</p><br/><p>I declared.</p><br/><p>Even if she is a \u201cWorld Traveler\u201d, I possess the power rivaling demon lords.</p><br/><p>No matter how far my abilities have been restricted, I can hardly imagine losing to her.</p><br/><p>Is what I thought, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? What kids are you talking about?</p><br/><p>Besides, I\u2019m surprised. Are you honestly thinking that you can win against me in this barrier?\u300d</p><br/><p>She smiled in amusement and whispered the response.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, seven rainbow colored lights shot out from her sword.</p><br/><p>A series of high speed thrusts. The afterimage matches the color of the jewels?</p><br/><p>I tried to avoid it, but my body felt heavy.</p><br/><p>Seriously! Even physical abilities are restricted.</p><br/><p>In spite of my attempts, I was hit thrice.</p><br/><p>A burning pain ran through my body. Pain? I felt something I should be resistant to.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Not all of them hit I see.</p><br/><p>I am impressed by your evasive abilities. I wonder how far you can go?\u300d</p><br/><p>Without giving me a second to rest, she resumed her onslaught.</p><br/><p>I tried blocking the hits with my sword. But as if her thrusts were passing through the sword, I was hit again.</p><br/><p>Feeling imminent danger, I jumped away from her.</p><br/><p>Thus, I was hit four times. Somehow, I feel that taking any more hits is dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, have you noticed this skill\u2019s powers?</p><br/><p>There have been plenty of fools who have perished without offering even a hint of resistance\u2026</p><br/><p>Seems like you\u2019re a bit brighter than the rest\u300d</p><br/><p>With a small nod, she complimented me.</p><br/><p>Not that it makes me happy.</p><br/><p>This skill probably transmits pain not to the nerves, but directly to the soul. So there\u2019s no way to guard against it.</p><br/><p>The fact that there is not a single wound on my body is proof.</p><br/><p>I had the\u300eGreat Sage\u300frun some predictions based on my observations. It seems that I will die if I get hit thrice more.</p><br/><p>Not the death of the flesh but of the soul itself.</p><br/><p>What an absurd skill. But I can\u2019t be certain whether this is a skill or an ability of the magic sword.</p><br/><p>Honestly, seems like I was underestimating my opponent too much.</p><br/><p>Sakaguchi Hinata. She definitely has a unique skill.</p><br/><p>On top of not knowing what it is, the fact that my abilities are sealed put me at a great disadvantage in this fight.</p><br/><p>In fact, I probably should have attempted escaping since the moment I found out I was trapped inside the barrier.</p><br/><p>Though whether I could escape or not\u2026</p><br/><p>I\u2019m constantly a step behind.</p><br/><p>From what I tried out, neither\u300eBlack Flame\u300f,\u300eBlack Lightning\u300f, nor\u300eBarrier\u300f can be used.</p><br/><p>Moreover, since\u300eCloning\u300f,\u300eDevil Transformation\u300f, and\u300eFire Change\u300fare also magic energy manipulation abilities, I can\u2019t even transform.</p><br/><p>All my certain-win skills having been sealed without even having a chance to put them to use.</p><br/><p>Not that I am completely defenseless, though.</p><br/><p>\u300cFumu. What are you planning, I wonder.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s useless, you know?</p><br/><p>A rank monsters trapped in the Holy Barrier cannot live for long.</p><br/><p>C rank monsters are immediately purified.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t you understand? The barrier purifies magical energy itself.</p><br/><p>Therefore, high level monsters like you lose most of your power and cannot fight as you normally would.</p><br/><p>It is the strongest barrier the church has against you monsters.</p><br/><p>Normally, it is used for Disaster Class A rank monsters and above\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh and you said that I wouldn\u2019t be enough to kill you, but there was hardly a need for me to come out.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s overkill.</p><br/><p>But, I guess I did want to try talking to you once.</p><br/><p>Since you killed Shizu-sensei.</p><br/><p>Perhaps not revenge, but she would have wanted me to kill you, no?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI did technically kill Shizu-san, but that was\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat was? Doesn\u2019t matter. She was the only person who was nice to me in the whole world. And now she is gone\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Not a feeling I myself understand. She murmured and looked at me.</p><br/><p>Her eyes simply declare me as her prey.</p><br/><p>After showing such an overwhelming difference, she stands motionless.</p><br/><p>Her confidence probably comes from the power she has just displayed.</p><br/><p>And, if I trust what she is saying, my chances of victory inside the barrier are next to none.</p><br/><p>If I don\u2019t dispel it, I will certainly lose.</p><br/><p>But, she believes me to be Shizu-san\u2019s nemesis? That I don\u2019t get.</p><br/><p>Since a while ago, something about her conversation seems off.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s no time for that.</p><br/><p>If anything, I mostly worry about\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThis barrier can only be created by the Holy Knights. So don\u2019t worry.</p><br/><p>The ones sent to your city cannot use it.</p><br/><p>But, creating a weak barrier is part of our curriculum, so they will create a weak one.</p><br/><p>Before long, you\u2019ll lose a place to return to, you see?</p><br/><p>Not that you\u2019ll be able to return\u300d</p><br/><p>As I thought; if they use such a barrier to attack Tempest, my friends will be in danger.</p><br/><p>They are an opponent we must immediately crush. But how unexpectedly annoying they are!</p><br/><p>My only option is to use attacks that don\u2019t use magical energy.</p><br/><p>That is\u2013the sword and unique skills.</p><br/><p>Her sword hand is superior to mine. My physical strength is slowly falling\u2013that much is true\u2013but she hasn\u2019t shown her true skill yet either.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to believe it, but I feel the same pressure from her that I do from Hakurou.</p><br/><p>Which is why I have to depend on unique skills to defeat her.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t something I wanted to reveal. I am hesitant to use it, but I have no choice.</p><br/><p>First, I raised my abilities using\u3008Fighting Spirit Technique\u3009. Moreover, I activated\u300eHerculean Strength\u300f.</p><br/><p>As expected, I can use skills that don\u2019t rely on magical energy.</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t it too early to think that you have won?\u300d</p><br/><p>I readied my sword and went on the offensive.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Hakurou\u2019s guidance, I have gotten rather good with the sword.</p><br/><p>Maybe out of surprise, but Hinata went on the defense.</p><br/><p>No\u2026 she\u2019s just being careful.</p><br/><p>Her eyes. They are the eyes of a chef looking at a fish on the cutting board.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s no surprise, she is analyzing my attacks and looking for a weakness. Nor is that pride\u2013she looks uninterested, as if doing her job.</p><br/><p>Nor were her previous words fueled by pride, but by raw calculation.</p><br/><p>That sending her against me is overkill is mere truth to her.</p><br/><p>She was not looking down on me in the slightest\u2026</p><br/><p>Even now, as she observes my movements, she is making predictions. To my superior speed she is offering the perfect response.</p><br/><p>This feels as if I were fighting the\u300eGreat Sage\u300finstead of her.</p><br/><p>When she received a hit from the sword strengthened by\u300eHerculean Strength\u300fI understood.</p><br/><p>The overwhelming difference between us.</p><br/><p>Though the tip of the sword has almost reached the speed of sound, she has yet to be wounded.</p><br/><p>She is able to perfectly read my attacks.</p><br/><p>And in order to do that, you\u2019d have to be as proficient as Hakurou.</p><br/><p>The second I lost my balance, she landed two more hits with deadly precision.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? Is this the end?</p><br/><p>But, yeah. Being able to move that well in this barrier is commendable.</p><br/><p>Honestly, I looked down on you. But even now, you can\u2019t win against me.</p><br/><p>You\u2019ve held up well, until now, that is. You have already received six hits.</p><br/><p>The special ability of the sword, Dead End Rainbow, bestows certain death upon an opponent it has struck seven times.</p><br/><p>There was no need to teach you this, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to pass on without knowing what killed you, would you?\u300d</p><br/><p>She said.</p><br/><p>The truth as she saw it. And make no mistake, that\u2019s is the truth since I saw it as well.</p><br/><p>But, though she masquerades it as an act of kindness, she really intends to instill fear in me and push me into making a mistake.</p><br/><p>She is perfectly prudent. Meaning there is no other reason for her to teach me this.</p><br/><p>Even with my abilities sealed I had thought I would manage somehow, but she\u2019s the worst opponent for me.</p><br/><p>An opponent who knows neither pride nor negligence. One that would use her best hand to win.</p><br/><p>And, she kept analyzing my abilities while fighting; yet being so sure of her victory, she has yet to neglect to continue analyzing.</p><br/><p>The situation was simply that hopeless. Never had I thought I\u2019d face such a hopeless situation.</p><br/><p>Even with the limitless Milim I could imagine a thing or two to do. Not that I\u2019d win, of course\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThen I\u2019ll continue this pointless struggle.</p><br/><p>I am not so obedient that I\u2019d just roll over and die when asked!\u300d</p><br/><p>I respond, and try something I have yet to use.</p><br/><p>That is, spirit summoning. Spirits are something other than magical energy.</p><br/><p>While I cannot summon a spirit without making a contract, I can call forth the one resting inside me.</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. The High Spirit Ifrit has been separated from the\u300eShapeshifter\u300fskill.\u226b</p><br/><p>Seems like it was a success.</p><br/><p>I could allow this spirits skills to change, resulting in various types of magical abilities, but not this time.</p><br/><p>The reason is: I fear it won\u2019t reach her.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, she is not the type of an opponent to fall for petty tricks.</p><br/><p>If I don\u2019t go all out in one shot, I cannot win.</p><br/><p>\u300cServe thy purpose, Fire Spirit Ifrit!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>At my call, the Ifrit materialized.</p><br/><p>A magical energy link was established between the Ifrit and I, resulting in magical energy flowing from me to him.</p><br/><p>Thus, my energy was finally put into some use.</p><br/><p>However, that was not the reason why I called him out.</p><br/><p>Ifrit began his attack. Thus, she should be too occupied to attack me.</p><br/><p>As expected, she is busy fighting with the Ifrit.</p><br/><p>Thus, I could launch some attacks on her,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? To even be able to summon high level spirits, how unexpected; but, that\u2019s not enough to defeat me\u300d</p><br/><p>She declared facing me, interrupting my attack.</p><br/><p>Ifrit is a high ranking spirit.</p><br/><p>Even if we are inside the Holy Barrier, spirits are natural energy and are unaffected.</p><br/><p>Since this is a barrier of holy power.</p><br/><p>Even if that was not the case, Ifrit, who surpasses A rank, would not be defeated by it.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>By the looks of it, Ifrit is looking back, crouching. As if he were defying my orders.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, what did you do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll answer if you tell me what you were planning to do?\u300d</p><br/><p>The air tensed between us.</p><br/><p>\u300cReturn, Ifrit!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing that call, Ifrit disappeared, and returned back inside of me.</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. Ifrit was subjected to a Forced Control Ability</p><br/><p>The opponent probably attempted to steal Ifrit away\u226b</p><br/><p>Forced control ability? So her power is to take away\u2026</p><br/><p>This World Traveler Sakaguchi Hinata is a monster far exceeding my predictions.</p><br/><p>I was blinded by the barrier, thinking that it was the reason for the close battle, but that was a mistake.</p><br/><p>In fact, the barrier is merely there to make me believe that and let my guard down.</p><br/><p>Did I really believe I could defeat her!</p><br/><p>A lovely smile appears on her face.</p><br/><p>What a terrifying enemy she is.</p><br/><p>She has yet to use all her strength\u2013that much I am sure of.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2026 tried to snatch Ifrit away, huh\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? How did you know?</p><br/><p>Since you found out, I\u2019ll let you know.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re right. It\u2019s thanks to my unique skill\u300eUsurper\u300f\u300d</p><br/><p>Unique skill\u300eUsurper\u300fshe says\u2026</p><br/><p>The ability to take away the strength of one\u2019s enemies and their spirits! Similar to my\u300ePredator\u300f.</p><br/><p>But she does so without having to analyze the abilities, so it\u2019s more battle oriented.</p><br/><p>I see, so fighting \u201cWorld Travelers\u201d will inevitably lead to a clash between unique abilities, huh\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s guaranteed for summoned ones, but seems like World Travelers can also acquire one.</p><br/><p>Actually, no; I should expect the most powerful individuals in this world to possess a unique skill.</p><br/><p>The fact that I didn\u2019t consider that before only shows my immaturity.</p><br/><p>I see, that\u2019s why Hinata has been observing me the whole time. A textbook fighting method.</p><br/><p>Just shows how much more fighting experience she has.</p><br/><p>While I am unsure whether her ability is superior to mine, her use of it probably is.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t win without betting my very existence here.</p><br/><p>However, I will lose after taking one more hit.</p><br/><p>She even so easily crushed my Ifrit trump card, so I have only one thing left to do.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not something I want to use, but I have no choice here.</p><br/><p>I have no idea what will happen as a result, or whether it will reach the barrier\u2026</p><br/><p>But I have to try.</p><br/><p>\u300cHinata, we have yet many things to discuss, but I don\u2019t have enough time.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019ll have to settle this next time\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStill haven\u2019t given up? Well, be my guest\u2026</p><br/><p>Rest easy.</p><br/><p>The last attack will be on a completely different level of pain than the rest.\u300d</p><br/><p>She looked at me one last time,</p><br/><p>(Oi, I leave the rest to you\u300eGreat Sage\u300f!)</p><br/><p>\u226aUnderstood. Order has been received. After confirming the situation, I will execute command\u226b</p><br/><p>I am impaled by last attack</p><br/><p>\u300cDie! Dead End Rainbow!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAwaken,\u300eGluttony\u300f!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>After shouting that order, my consciousness fell into seemingly endless darkness.</p><br/><p>As if falling asleep, I fell unconscious.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>At the same moment as the rapier pierced Rimuru\u2019s flesh,\u300eGluttony\u300fawakened on commend.</p><br/><p>The awakened demon, stared at the rapier stuck in his flesh, and began to change.</p><br/><p>Hinata quickly noticed Rimuru\u2019s change and was on her guard.</p><br/><p>She felt the sword grow heavy in her hand.</p><br/><p>For some reason, she decided to let it go; little did she know that this decision saved her life.</p><br/><p>A pale blue light enveloped the rapier down to the hilt.</p><br/><p>In front of her eyes, Rimuru began to change, but collapsed without taking a form.</p><br/><p>After all, the barrier prevented any kind of change caused by magic manipulation. Transformation was included in that list.</p><br/><p>But, that being didn\u2019t care\u2013it moved towards her formless.</p><br/><p>While swallowing everything in its wake.</p><br/><p>Dangerous! Hinata felt.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s hard to believe, but it\u2019s absorbing the very environment.</p><br/><p>Had she been a second late releasing that sword, she would have been swallowed whole already.</p><br/><p>But it kept targeting Hinata, moving on sound, heat, and smell alone.</p><br/><p>Unbelievable. She murmured.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Dead End Rainbow is as advertised\u2013it destroys the opponents soul after seven hits.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless\u2026</p><br/><p>This being will not die, as it does not have a soul.</p><br/><p>Since coming to this world, she has discerned the three layers of souls.</p><br/><p>The soul\u2013the source of power for humans and monsters.</p><br/><p>Cloaking themselves in their souls, the most brittle existence, the astral bodies</p><br/><p>Establishing themselves in power, spiritual bodies</p><br/><p>Those who have a direct connection to this world, material bodies</p><br/><p>The soul is the entity itself, there is no \u201cbeing\u201d outside of it.</p><br/><p>Any kind of consideration requires the presence of an astral body.</p><br/><p>Of course, should it be based on astral body alone, the being will dissipate into thin air.</p><br/><p>So a medium to record the memories is needed\u2013spiritual body.</p><br/><p>However, spiritual body preserves kind of like virtual memory, hence cannot serve as a permanent medium.</p><br/><p>Hence the flesh.</p><br/><p>So for those with tempered souls, should they even sustain brain damage, recovery of certain memories becomes possible.</p><br/><p>And, there are monsters who live with only a soul. That kind of being, however, is inferior to the rest.</p><br/><p>But, even if it is but a soul, should it obtain some level of intelligence, it will be recognized as a monster.</p><br/><p>These are what the world knows as the four dragons, the highest form of being.</p><br/><p>But, even this special race requires a soul. So what is happening before her now completely escapes her understanding.</p><br/><p>For the first time ever, Hinata felt anxiety.</p><br/><p>The only thing she could think of\u2026</p><br/><p>Would this no longer be a life-form?</p><br/><p>At the very least, it has certainly exceeded the definition of \u201clife\u201d of this world.</p><br/><p>Yet before her eyes, it continuously tried to take shape. Right now, it looked like a slime.</p><br/><p>No, Hinata thought, it was a slime to begin with.</p><br/><p>What was now before her was far more sinister\u2013devouring all life insight.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something she could quickly defeat. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t something she couldn\u2019t defeat.</p><br/><p>Her weapon, however, crumbling before her eyes,</p><br/><p>\u300cAstral Bind!\u300d</p><br/><p>She took out an amulet from her bag, and erected another barrier with it.</p><br/><p>One that binds not the flesh, but every level of one\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>However, the slime continued to move.</p><br/><p>As I thought\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus, Hinata concluded that the slime before her was but Rimuru\u2019s empty husk.</p><br/><p>The result of the last works Rimuru called out\u2013Gluttony, was it?</p><br/><p>Probably, though his soul was destroyed he activated some kind of program to defeat his opponent\u2026</p><br/><p>In that case, this is simple.</p><br/><p>If it doesn\u2019t have a soul, it\u2019s hardly an enemy. All you need to do is stop the body from moving.</p><br/><p>Of course, she still needed to watch out for getting caught and devoured by this half-baked thing.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh my. You are a pain even after death\u2026 I hate you.</p><br/><p>But, if I don\u2019t erase what you have become, I fear you\u2019ll wreak havoc upon the world\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She grumbled to herself, while coming up with a plan.</p><br/><p>The point was to stop it\u2019s movements. Having so decided, Hinata started to summon spirits.</p><br/><p>The myriad of spirits attacked the slime as a flood.</p><br/><p>Normally, she\u2019d summon a demon, but that wouldn\u2019t be possible within the Holy Barrier.</p><br/><p>So while she did feel bad for the Spirits, they\u2019d have to go out and die.</p><br/><p>While confirming that the spirits have occupied the slime, Hinata began to chant a grand spell.</p><br/><p>Thanks to her ability\u300eMathematician\u300fshe can normally ignore the chant, but this time was different.</p><br/><p>The magic that she could use within the barrier belong to\u3008Incantation\u3009and\u3008Spirit Magic\u3009as these do not rely directly on magical energy.</p><br/><p>The magic that she is planning to use is the ultimate attack magic from the\u3008Divine Magic\u3009archive.</p><br/><p>The atheist Hinata was praying to a god.</p><br/><p>Finding this very fact ironic, Hinata hated this magic. However, her preferences aside, the magic that Hinata knows, the strongest among it, is limited to the ones taught by the church.</p><br/><p>Her hands stretched out in front of her, one is drawing some complicated symbols in the air, while the other is drawing geometric shapes.</p><br/><p>After quickly weaving such a complicated spell, a completed magic circle was now before her.</p><br/><p>The decorative glasses have by now fallen off her face, and,</p><br/><p>\u300cI lift my prayers to the heavens. I ask, for a holy strength.</p><br/><p>I beg, for my prayer to be heard.</p><br/><p>Upon all of creation! Disintegration!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>A power befitting a god.</p><br/><p>Though it\u2019s not an area attack, since it targets everything from the atom to the soul, it is considered the strongest anti-personnel magic.</p><br/><p>Upon completing the chant, a brilliant white light shot out from her hands.</p><br/><p>A blinding light.</p><br/><p>It traveled to the target at a speed of 300,000 km/s. Equal to the speed of light.</p><br/><p>The skill completely vaporizes the target via holy energy. The down-side\u2013it requires a long time to prepare.</p><br/><p>Amidst a magic fight, or a duel, it is not a power you can use. Moreover, it requires a large amount of energy to use, and can be used at most once per day.</p><br/><p>However, there is not a single being who could withstand this attack.</p><br/><p>Now, the hideous slime, who barely feels any damage from the environment, has disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>This is also a skill which only erases its target.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s over, huh\u2026 you were harder than expected\u300d</p><br/><p>Hinata sighed in relief, and so muttered.</p><br/><p>Using spirits she notified the Holy Barrier knights squad to dispel it.</p><br/><p>She had originally thought that there was no need to erect it, but the informant insisted that it was necessary.</p><br/><p>Had she fought without it\u2026</p><br/><p>She thought not further. She refused to consider meaningless possibilities.</p><br/><p>Moreover\u2026</p><br/><p>She was busy thinking about what the slime Rimuru has said.</p><br/><p>The kids? What was that about?</p><br/><p>Ah, whatever. Thinking about it wouldn\u2019t help. What can she do about something she has never heard of?</p><br/><p>After confirming that the barrier has been dispelled, Hinata thought about the future.</p><br/><p>Would she be able to gain complete control of Tempest if she set off for the city?</p><br/><p>First is information gathering.</p><br/><p>She decided to first learn of the subjugation team\u2019s progress, so she returned to the church.</p><br/><p>By now, the monster named Rimuru was completely forgotten.</p><br/><p>Whether they were strong or weak, there\u2019s no use thinking about something that was erased.</p><br/><p>The chance that the monster was still alive was completely ignored by her.</p><br/><p>That is the secret to her strength and her greatest weakness, though she herself is unaware of the fact.</p><br/><p>Hinata\u2019s only thought at the time was\u300cI need a new sword\u300d</p><br/><p>And thus she left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

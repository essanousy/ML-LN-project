I didn\u2019t know the landlord was night itself! To think you were such an important being! I am very impressed.</p><br/><p>Landlord: What foolishness are you on about now?</p><br/><p>Clown: The same one as always; I am a Clown, after all.</p><br/><p>Landlord: *Sigh* The police stopped by today; were they here for your illegal translation?</p><br/><p>Clown: How rude! I have permission from the author to translate it!</p><br/><p>Landlord: Is that so\u2026 don\u2019t cause me any problems, you hear? I\u2019ll raise your rent!</p><br/><p>Clown: \u2026 Landlord-san, turn that smile upside down.

A City\u2019s Specialty</p><br/><p>Devil Grucius is a wolfman.</p><br/><p>Valued for his excellent espionage abilities, he was assigned a secret mission by the Demon Lord Karion.</p><br/><p>He was remembering his words,</p><br/><p>\u300cObserve them but take care to go unnoticed; if you see any other devils, extend the invitation to the oni before them!\u300d</p><br/><p>Devils other than himself? When he asked about that, Karion added,</p><br/><p>\u300cClayman and Milim will be sending one of their subordinates there.</p><br/><p>Working together with them gives me the creeps, so do as I asked!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, averting his gaze.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! Karion-sama! Why have you averted your gaze?</p><br/><p>Could they be such troublesome opponents?\u300d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this question, Karion was confused for a second, but his confusion quickly turned into a broad grin.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see! You haven\u2019t heard of Milim, have you! Is that how it is\u2026 I see, I see!</p><br/><p>Alright! No problem, in that case. Regarding Milim\u2019s subordinate, or rather, the one who refers to oneself as her subordinate\u2013do not go against her!</p><br/><p>As long as she stays happy, all is good! But I have complete trust in you!\u300d</p><br/><p>So he said.</p><br/><p>Grucius was thinking about the question he ardently tried to dismiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilim\u201d most likely refers to Demon Lord Milim Nava. A famous demon lord that even Grucius has heard of.</p><br/><p>She is indeed strong. By strength alone, she would be a match for Karion-sama; the worst case scenario\u2013she would surpass him.</p><br/><p>Her personality can be described with four words: short tempered, haughty, cruel, and egoistic. Nothing good is ever said about her.</p><br/><p>However, why should he fear her subordinate?</p><br/><p>It has been only 100 years since Grucius became a devil. So, he naturally did not know.</p><br/><p>Not about Milim, at least\u2013those rumors excluded.</p><br/><p>Soon \u2013 when he reached the meeting place, to be precise \u2013 he quickly regretted his ignorance.</p><br/><p>Devil Myulan was lamenting her misfortune.</p><br/><p>Working with other Demon Lord\u2019s subordinates was bad enough. However, among them was Demon Lord Milim herself.</p><br/><p>\u300cI bear responsibility for that outcome\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Clayman said,</p><br/><p>\u300cBut I don\u2019t have any disposable pawns other than yourself.</p><br/><p>Had I not lost Gelmudo, I would have sent him, but\u2026</p><br/><p>Nothing we can do about that, right? He went and died!\u300d</p><br/><p>No further discussion would be held on this topic.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Clayman.</p><br/><p>Nicknamed Marionette Master. Someone who manipulates friends and subordinates like dolls.</p><br/><p>For him, the aforementioned matter is set in stone.</p><br/><p>And though Myulan was just called a disposable pawn, she lacked the willpower to retort.</p><br/><p>She had no choice but to accept.</p><br/><p>The demon lord named Milim she knew all too well.</p><br/><p>So Demon Lord Clayman gave her one order.</p><br/><p>Stall the other demon lords and find about their weaknesses!</p><br/><p>Just that much.</p><br/><p>Since Milim was involved in this case, any further activity would be impossible.</p><br/><p>Myulan agreed.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Milim is by no means stupid. She is called short tempered and impudent, but that is not true.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she possesses an abnormal perception, so fooling her would prove difficult.</p><br/><p>Thus, it would be best to not try to slip anything past her.</p><br/><p>But Myulan had no reason to be vigilant towards Milim\u2019s subordinate.</p><br/><p>And yet she was still on her guard against Milim.</p><br/><p>She understood why she should stay vigilant, Demon Lord Clayman had conveyed it to her a little while ago.</p><br/><p>Chances are, Demon Lord Karion also knew.</p><br/><p>The reason was,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, so you would be my comrades, huh? I am Demon Lord Karion\u2019s subordinate Grucius!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPleased to meet you, I am Demon Lord Clayman\u2019s Myulan!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m Milim!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s subordinate was nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how it was.</p><br/><p>And thus, the three gathered at the rendezvous point.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>The treaty between the Dwarf Kingdom and the Monsters\u2019 Country essentially testified bilateral cooperation.</p><br/><p>The fact that their two representatives signed the treaty ascertains its validity.</p><br/><p>Could a treaty between two countries be established this easily? Since that exceeds my knowledge, I asked,</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? That\u2019s not a problem. Since I swear by the gods, spirits, and sacred ancestors, I cannot falsely sign.</p><br/><p>And you aren\u2019t a human, are you?</p><br/><p>Through the contract\u2019s authority, should you lie, you\u2019d be erased, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>and received such a nonsensical response. So, I asked\u300eGreat Sage\u300ffor an explanation.</p><br/><p>Apparently, monsters can\u2019t lie. I was completely oblivious to that very important fact.</p><br/><p>We cannot convey what we believe to be a lie. However, that does not mean we can\u2019t fool people.</p><br/><p>Omitting facts, for example, or leading them to believe something by revealing only specific facts.</p><br/><p>However, in case of contracts, lying through the aforementioned methods becomes essentially impossible.</p><br/><p>Well, if you can talk yourself out of the lie then no problem; but if you publicly declare a lie, your existence will be erased.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a rule pertaining to every monster.</p><br/><p>However, monsters born through birth are not always bound by this rule, and sometimes capable of telling lies.</p><br/><p>Goblins can lie freely. On the other hand, high monsters and demons exemplify this rule, and are famous for being bound by contracts.</p><br/><p>Demons don\u2019t tell lies. Although they are often called sly, they are actually a rather pure race.</p><br/><p>And when people come to believe this they grow negligent, and a demon comes to snatch away their soul\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cEven though you\u2019re a monster, you didn\u2019t know this? Rimuru, aren\u2019t you strange\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve been born not too long ago. I\u2019m still in the process of learning?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so\u2026 well, whatever. Please don\u2019t accidentally erase your entire country after I went to the trouble of recognizing it!</p><br/><p>Your rule assures the safety of the entire forest. I beg you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, we\u2019ve just finished building this city, and we don\u2019t intend to lose it; so, we\u2019ll do our best!\u300d</p><br/><p>And thus, we signed the treaty into effect.</p><br/><p>I still don\u2019t know all of this world\u2019s alphabet, but I can at least write my name. I learned that much when I was bored.</p><br/><p>The moment I wrote my name, the document began to glow and split into two.</p><br/><p>The paper, it seems, was made by the Ghost Researchers. To annul it, you would need to burn both of the copies at the same time.</p><br/><p>However, as long as the other party is living, destroying the document is impossible. It would merely restore itself to how it was before.</p><br/><p>We tried that once, and it was exactly as they said.</p><br/><p>Thus the contract was complete. This contract should be kept between the two countries. And while openly declaring it is not a problem per se, it kind of defeats its purpose.</p><br/><p>There is no need to let the world know about it.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf King accepts his copy, pleased.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll also leave this to you!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, and took out a crystal as large as a fist.</p><br/><p>When I accepted it,</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a communication crystal. Ask Bester about its installation.</p><br/><p>Use it in case of an emergency. And stay in good health!\u300d</p><br/><p>He explained, and saddled the Pegasus.</p><br/><p>And, looking at Bester,</p><br/><p>\u300cBester, you should research to your heart\u2019s content here!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKing! This time, I will live up to your expectations!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said and nodded at the response.</p><br/><p>\u300cFarewell!\u300d</p><br/><p>He added, and flew off.</p><br/><p>He suddenly came, and hurriedly left.</p><br/><p>Just like a storm.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Kaijin, is it okay for your country to have such a\u2026 free willed individual as a king?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWho knows\u2026 but, he\u2019s ruled for many hundreds of years, and has plenty of achievements, so it should be fine!</p><br/><p>But never in my time in the court have I seen him move around so selfishly\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well! I\u2019m the last person who can criticize him!\u300d</p><br/><p>Right, I too am planning to run off to some human village.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not planning to say something that will limit my ability to move around.</p><br/><p>Leaving the conversation at that, we left the clearing.</p><br/><p>The treaty documents I deposited into my stomach.</p><br/><p>Since our defenses aren\u2019t perfect as of yet, having it stolen would make for a poor story.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould it reappear if I were to lose it?\u201d is an experiment I will not conduct.</p><br/><p>And thus, we successfully established a treaty with the Dwarf Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Now then, it\u2019s about time I consider the lesson Gazelle taught me yesterday\u2013</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-dono, Kaijin-dono, I humbly beg your forgiveness! Would it be possible for me to work here?\u300d</p><br/><p>Bester interrupted my thoughts.</p><br/><p>Now that he mentions it, he did almost entrap us\u2026 I had completely forgotten.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll be frank, can you follow my orders?</p><br/><p>I forbid discrimination against any race of monsters! Are you okay with that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. I have reflected on my mistakes. In the first place, it has lead me to feel envious of Kaijin-dono\u2026</p><br/><p>I will not repeat that mistake!</p><br/><p>I want to do continue my beloved research with all my strength; I would never betray that wish!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs for me, I would only benefit from an excellent researcher!</p><br/><p>If anything were to happen, I\u2019ll take responsibility for him.</p><br/><p>So, Rimuru-danna, please forgive him!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaijin said so.</p><br/><p>Well, rather than me, it would be you, Kaijin, who would be troubled\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, if you\u2019re fine with it Kaijin, I have no complaints.</p><br/><p>Pleased to have you, Bester!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus, Bester became our new comrade.</p><br/><p>And because he became our new comrade, we made a discovery which came to be our city\u2019s specialty.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Worst day ever.</p><br/><p>How many sighs has the devil Grucius suppressed until now?</p><br/><p>Remembering Demon Lord Karion\u2019s broad grin only evoked anger.</p><br/><p>He knew, that bastard. Actually, no\u2013I should have known myself. So he thought.</p><br/><p>Worst day ever.</p><br/><p>Who would have guessed that riding on his back would be a demon lord herself?</p><br/><p>Worst day ever.</p><br/><p>The moment they met,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, shorty. How dare you call yourself with a demon lord\u2019s name?</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t tell your master, so name yourself at once!\u300d</p><br/><p>He had said.</p><br/><p>And the second he said it, he was knocked unconscious.</p><br/><p>Grucius lamented his misfortune.</p><br/><p>In the first place, he had never seen the Demon Lord Milim.</p><br/><p>Having beautiful, glossy blond hair tied in twin tails, and a short stature, anyone would mistake her for some random kid.</p><br/><p>No one would expect her to be extremely strong.</p><br/><p>Though she was making a really cute face, the moment he called her a shorty, her expression changed.</p><br/><p>Her round eyes immediately turned sharp, and her lips twisted into a cruel smile.</p><br/><p>Then, his consciousness faded.</p><br/><p>After getting hit a second time, he was out cold; and that brings us to the present situation.</p><br/><p>The other devil Myulan ignored him.</p><br/><p>Worst day ever.</p><br/><p>Grucius was reflecting. Not to judge a devil by their looks is common sense, so why did he commit such a grave error\u2026</p><br/><p>Myulan must have known.</p><br/><p>Right before Grucius was hit he saw her eyes open wide, as if screaming: what the hell you saying, idiot?!</p><br/><p>He would probably say the same thing had he known\u2026</p><br/><p>Worst day ever.</p><br/><p>If only\u2026 if only he was told about this\u2026</p><br/><p>However, he was told not to go against whoever would call herself as Milim\u2019s subordinate.</p><br/><p>But who would have thought that she wouldn\u2019t call herself a subordinate but openly name herself\u2026?</p><br/><p>Is Milim honest to a fault? No, it was too late to have such thoughts.</p><br/><p>Since then, Grucius made sure to never judge a devil by their cover!</p><br/><p>And, now.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s in his wolf form, running through the forest.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his regenerative abilities, he somehow endured.</p><br/><p>After getting knocked around, he was then ordered to let her ride. Of course, he never even considered refusing.</p><br/><p>Myulan is running by his side.</p><br/><p>For the devils, this much wouldn\u2019t tire them at all.</p><br/><p>And thus, the three came upon a certain city.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>We\u2019ve been busy continuing developing our restorative medicine.</p><br/><p>Well, I doubt you can call trying to lower its performance \u201cdevelopment\u201d, however.</p><br/><p>Could we dilute a single restorative pill (98% purity) with ten times the amount of water to create a high class (60%) medicine?</p><br/><p>We tried to so, but it proved impossible. It turned into low grade (20%) medicine.</p><br/><p>If you used a high quality pill, the purity would only go up by 10%.</p><br/><p>And then, Bester made an unexpected discovery.</p><br/><p>He had wanted to see our hipokte grass farm, so I guided him to the Cave of the Seal.</p><br/><p>He was scared of riding the star wolf at first, but quickly got used to it.</p><br/><p>And thus, we entered the cave. Gabil welcomed us at the entrance and showed us in.</p><br/><p>After observing our cultivation, Bester went to look at the underground lake.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-dono, hipokte grass can be cultivated due to the high magic energy density of this lake, right?</p><br/><p>So what if we tried diluting the restorative pill not with normal water, but with this water?\u300d</p><br/><p>I see, we should test his theory at once!</p><br/><p>And so we did. We were able to produce medium grade (40%) medicine.</p><br/><p>Of course, with a high quality pill, the purity rose to 50%.</p><br/><p>How wonderful. A great success.</p><br/><p>We also tested just how much we could dilute it; from a single pill we could create 20 medium grade medicines.</p><br/><p>Nodding to Kaijin, I gave him a high five.</p><br/><p>We succeeded.</p><br/><p>The first specialty of Monsters\u2019 City Tempest.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s how we made it.</p><br/><p>Bester seemed like he was having a lot of fun handling the grass with Gabil.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they are rather compatible.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh, aren\u2019t you chummy. Bester, how about we make you a room here?\u300d</p><br/><p>I had meant it as a joke, but</p><br/><p>\u300cWould you really?! To think that I would also be permitted to reside in this cave.</p><br/><p>It has the perfect atmosphere for (mad) science experiments!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, his eyes sparkling.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you sure? There are B+ rank Centipedes around here, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. No problem.</p><br/><p>I may not look it, but I\u2019ve indulged in sorcery, and am rather good at it!\u300d</p><br/><p>I looked at Kaijin, and he was shaking his head. A lie?</p><br/><p>\u300cAs long as you don\u2019t regret it. We\u2019ll be preparing a room for you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo problem, I said! Gabil-dono is here, after all!\u300d</p><br/><p>I see, if Gabil is here, Bester won\u2019t be attacked, huh.</p><br/><p>Satisfied,</p><br/><p>\u300cGabil, can I leave Bester to you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease do! I am here, and I will also assign two of my subordinates!\u300d</p><br/><p>How reliable he has gotten.</p><br/><p>I still worry about him getting a big head, but I guess he was strong to begin with.</p><br/><p>But he seems to have calmed down recently, and gets along with Bester pretty well, so I should just leave it to him.</p><br/><p>And so, we had built Bester\u2019s research lab in the cave.</p><br/><p>Gabil had two of his subordinates guard the room in the cave, and the result was actually rather pleasant.</p><br/><p>If this is to become his lab, we probably don\u2019t need to include any life necessities.</p><br/><p>But, we do need to figure out how he will be making the trip to the cave all the time.</p><br/><p>While I was thinking these things,</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-dono, can I set up a magic circle here?</p><br/><p>It would be difficult to create inside these doors, but it is possible outside.</p><br/><p>Should I set it up?\u300d</p><br/><p>I had mentioned before that I want to have a magic circle at the place where I defeated the black snake.</p><br/><p>A\u3008Transportation Magic System\u3009circle, to be precise. If you write two identical circles, you can move between them.</p><br/><p>Well, I guess it wouldn\u2019t be inaccurate to say that I\u2019m coming to like sorcery. Kaijin was also surprised, hearing Bester explain this.</p><br/><p>Thus, as long as monsters won\u2019t be appearing in the middle of our village, I decided to permit it.</p><br/><p>Bester then drew a circle inside his house and another inside the cave. And thus, he solved the transportation problem.</p><br/><p>But wow, transportation circles are convenient.</p><br/><p>Of course, I had him immediately teach me.</p><br/><p>And, after Gabil and the rest also learned it, we were able to move easily between the city and the cave.</p><br/><p>Bester is an unexpectedly useful dwarf.</p><br/><p>As for the guy himself, he was just engrossed fantasizing about all the research he will do.</p><br/><p>Since I left some restorative pills and demon steel with him, he can continue researching those on his own.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve also introduced him to Kurobee and Shuna, which started another long conversation.</p><br/><p>Rather than politics, this guy is made for science.</p><br/><p>He seemed very boring when he was obsessed with political power.</p><br/><p>I guess it corrupts you.</p><br/><p>But truly, people should be doing whatever they enjoy. As long as that doesn\u2019t cause trouble for others!</p><br/><p>And so, after spending some time with Bester, he naturally became one of our comrades.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Ending his meditation, he opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>In the middle of a dimly lit room of a high class inn, the Dwarf King sat.</p><br/><p>One that the Espionage Department\u2019s leader stayed at\u2013using an alias, of course.</p><br/><p>The King laughed. It\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s had such an interesting experience.</p><br/><p>\u300cKing, are you in good health?\u300d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a shadow appeared nearby.</p><br/><p>He knew right away\u2013it was one of his spies.</p><br/><p>The fact that he slipped out of the palace and was now here probably caused a great commotion at the palace.</p><br/><p>In the first place, he has a hundred people as his personal guard, for them to have let someone in or out undetected is simply preposterous.</p><br/><p>They needed to be retrained, so the King thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo problem!\u300d</p><br/><p>He answered briefly.</p><br/><p>There could have been no problems. Then, though it\u2019s been a long time since he last used this skill, he used\u300eSpirit Possession\u300fon the spy.</p><br/><p>And, let the Espionage Leader know,</p><br/><p>(You will return to the Royal Capital, taking the Pegasus with you! Disappear into the shadows as you always do after that)</p><br/><p>(Ay! As you command!)</p><br/><p>A typical exchange.</p><br/><p>His trusted confidant, Espionage Department\u2019s leader.</p><br/><p>With a same face and the same body. A clone created by the Ghost Researchers.</p><br/><p>That was a secret shared only between the two of them.</p><br/><p>Unlike towards a stranger, the King could perfectly use\u300eSpirit Possession\u300fon this spy.</p><br/><p>In case of some emergency, this was his trump card.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf King Gazelle Dwargo was remembering yesterday\u2019s match with the slime.</p><br/><p>That slime will become very strong\u2026</p><br/><p>Just with reaction speed alone he was able to receive my sword.</p><br/><p>Gazelle did not intend to hit the sword out of Rimuru\u2019s hands. He intended to land a hit on Rimuru\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>And that hit, whether he fell behind with the attack or not, Rimuru was able to react to.</p><br/><p>How amusing, he though from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>What will become of this treaty, he did not know.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t disappoint me, Slime Rimuru!</p><br/><p>Gazelle felt the approaching end of the era of peace.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

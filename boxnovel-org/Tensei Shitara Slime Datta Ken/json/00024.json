That being the norm, she could do naught but accept.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you wish to live? If you desire life, answer my call!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice resounded in her head.</p><br/><p>Do I want to live? Why? I don\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>She was too young to answer such a question.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 looking at her mother who was reduced to nothing but a hand\u2026 I want to live!

Acquiring Extra Skill [Fire Manipulation]\u2026 success\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>The next time I opened my eyes I was in a demon\u2019s lair.</p><br/><p>The one in front of me, was a beautiful Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Long golden hair, blue eyes. A well ordered face, almond shaped eyes.</p><br/><p>And skin so pale it\u2019s almost transparent.</p><br/><p>So beautiful that it wouldn\u2019t be strange to mistake him for a woman.</p><br/><p>Leon Cromwell.</p><br/><p>He is whom the humans call the Demon Lord. Also known as the Blond Devil.</p><br/><p>\u300cAah\u2026 failed again.\u300d</p><br/><p>He so muttered, losing interest in her.</p><br/><p>However, he did not kill the girl whose body was covered in burns.</p><br/><p>She did not matter to him.</p><br/><p>And the girl, found that fact vexing.</p><br/><p>Even now she sometimes recalls. That beautiful face. And, the arrogant eyes, devoid of interest.</p><br/><p>But at the time, she could only survive by clinging to him,</p><br/><p>In the end, she was saved by the Demon Lord\u2019s whim.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a second\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She reached out to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he, beautiful like an angel, would heal my pain?\u201d So she thought, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThought it was just trash, but this thing is suitable with fire, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>With those words, he called forth the Flame Giant Ifrit. With no incantation, as if he were breathing.</p><br/><p>And the summoned Ifrit, obeyed without question.</p><br/><p>\u300cI bestow upon you flesh. Use it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Those words, to the girl, became undeniable proof dashing her hopes.</p><br/><p>And thus, the pain she felt turned into hatred\u2013</p><br/><p>As this curse (trauma) engraved itself upon her heart.</p><br/><p>However, is can also be said that this possession enabled her to keep her life.</p><br/><p>Since then, how much time had passed\u2026?</p><br/><p>As a flame demon, she ruled over one of the Demon Lord\u2019s castle. By his side, as a high demon.</p><br/><p>*Gotsun gotsun gotsun*</p><br/><p>The footsteps reverberated through the castle halls.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord had already ran away. Abandoning this castle.</p><br/><p>The girl was the rear guard. A sacrificial piece.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord had treated her as a tool until the very end. Nothing had indicated otherwise.</p><br/><p>The one who was approaching was the \u201cHero\u201d.</p><br/><p>Long black hair gathered into a ponytail, and covering her body\u2013black light armor.</p><br/><p>A beauty that would rival the Demon Lord. The only difference, the hero was a woman.</p><br/><p>With one glance, she was certain.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t win!</p><br/><p>When that thought overpowered Ifrit\u2019s minds, a little of the girl\u2019s ego had returned.</p><br/><p>She looked the hero in the eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cHe\u2026. help me\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Words that one\u2019d easily ignored. Who\u2019d trust the words of a demon\u2026?</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019ll be fine from now on. Good job enduring this far!\u300d</p><br/><p>And from then on she was cared by the hero.</p><br/><p>The \u201cAnti-demon Mask\u201d she wore restrained Ifrit and hid her burns.</p><br/><p>Her whole body she covered with a robe, and thus she followed the hero.</p><br/><p>And one day, she came to be called the \u201cExplosion Monarch\u201d.</p><br/><p>Then one day the Hero left on a journey.</p><br/><p>Her reason she did not understand. It was probably a reason the Hero could not ignore.</p><br/><p>The girl as well planned similar action. That one day she\u2019d set of on a journey.</p><br/><p>To kill the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Who had saved her life, and then threw her away.</p><br/><p>That is, killing the demon lord Leon Cromwell became her life\u2019s goal.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the girl hardly found the hero\u2019s actions reproachable.</p><br/><p>But there was one regret left\u2013she had never seen the hero\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>Since then, the girl became famous for her heroic deeds.</p><br/><p>Sometimes called one of the founders of the Freedom Association, she had worked for the expansion and benefit of the Adventurer Cooperation Union.</p><br/><p>She also took part training adventurers and her successors.</p><br/><p>At one time, she had taught excellent pupils.</p><br/><p>With a sincere, pure gaze\u2013a boy. Kagurazaka Yuuki.</p><br/><p>With a depressed gaze\u2013 a girl. Sakaguchi Hinata.</p><br/><p>These two were excellent students and fellow Japanese World Travelers.</p><br/><p>These two were polar opposites.</p><br/><p>The bright and optimistic Yuuki, and the grudge-against-the-world Hinata.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because Hinata was attacked the moment she came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>So thought Shizue.</p><br/><p>She was able to kill the assailants, and thus escaped safely, but probably made some frightening memories as a result.</p><br/><p>She thought that Hinata was somehow similar to herself, and thus grew sympathetic.</p><br/><p>But, that was a mistake.</p><br/><p>\u300cSensei, thank you for the care you have shown. I fear there is nothing else I can learn from you. Nor shall we meet again, I think.\u300d</p><br/><p>With those words, and without a second glance, Hinata had left.</p><br/><p>She, in a mere month, had surpassed Shizue in strength. Such overwhelming excellence\u2026</p><br/><p>After a few years, Hinata had received an important post within the empire, but was not satisfied.</p><br/><p>Rather, she had treated the promotion with mild indifference\u2026</p><br/><p>In comparison, Yuuki was a sweet boy.</p><br/><p>After the Adventurers Cooperation Union had formally changed its name to Freedom Association, Yuuki had introduced the current ranking system.</p><br/><p>As a result of it, casualties during subjugation missions greatly decreased.</p><br/><p>And thus, to this day.</p><br/><p>Shizue had been supporting Yuuki behind the scenes.</p><br/><p>That is, she no longer could do anything but guide new adventurers.</p><br/><p>And, recently,</p><br/><p>The time she spent as a demon have begun to haunt her in her dreams.</p><br/><p>As her lifespan dwindled, she felt she was unable to restrain Ifrit\u2019s consciousness any longer.</p><br/><p>However, the \u201canti-demon mask\u201d has yet to fail her.</p><br/><p>So she told herself, \u201cI don\u2019t have long to live!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s at least shoot an arrow at the demon lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, she decided to set off.</p><br/><p>Which she reported to Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Without a word, he acknowledged her resolve. Perhaps he had wanted to stop her, but\u2026</p><br/><p>At the time, a message came from the the Farmas Kingdom\u2019s guild.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s disappearance confirmed. Will continue investigation!</p><br/><p>Was it perhaps some divine guidance?</p><br/><p>In any case, they needed help to break into the forest.</p><br/><p>Someone needed to slip in with the trio.</p><br/><p>Their specialties she had heard from Yuuki. And as she had heard, they were a cheerful bunch.</p><br/><p>She was glad to have met such good companions on her last journey.</p><br/><p>A strange city.</p><br/><p>Saved by monsters, they were brought there.</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t really a city, though; lacking a single building, everyone lived in tents. Clearly a temporary measure.</p><br/><p>Even so, it was full of life and monsters (!) happily worked there. A bizarre city.</p><br/><p>It was unthinkable, in the first place, to be saved by monsters.</p><br/><p>Had she used her flame power she could have easily burned away the giant ants; but, she felt that she shouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>That is, each time she used her powers, Ifrit\u2019s consciousness would strengthen.</p><br/><p>Her negligence could lead to her powers running wild.</p><br/><p>Thus, she met a strange monster, with the attitude of a king, arrogantly carrying itself.</p><br/><p>Amusing.</p><br/><p>Although the monster could speak, the words uttered were,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I am a slime, I am not an evil slime\u201d and such!</p><br/><p>A line that no one would ever believe.</p><br/><p>The fun times abruptly ended.</p><br/><p>I still haven\u2019t achieved my goal\u2026</p><br/><p>At the moment her life force seemed to have finally ran out, Ifrit took over her consciousness.</p><br/><p>Again\u2026 I\u2019ll cause problems for\u2026</p><br/><p>As if sneering at her thoughts and hopes, the demon had manifested.</p><br/><p>And she lost her consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>..</p><br/><p>I tried to check on the woman\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>Chances are, no matter how long I wait,</p><br/><p>She will probably not awaken.</p><br/><p>However, as a compatriot of mine, I want to see her through to the end. Those were my thoughts.</p><br/><p>The three injured adventurers were in high spirits.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be paying your hospital bills!\u201d I wanted to shout, but,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is this? The burns have completely disappeared\u2026 and my skin feels smooth and shiny!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAwesome\u2026 with those injuries, I thought we\u2019d be bedridden for weeks\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I\u2019ll be\u2026 these guys have some amazing medicine.\u300d</p><br/><p>They seem to have healed without issue.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, with this, we won\u2019t be getting any injury compensation, will we?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah\u2026 No one we\u2019ll believe us\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYup\u2026 but I\u2019d take this over being left with injuries!\u300d</p><br/><p>Suddenly they had started to discuss their financial worries.</p><br/><p>They can\u2019t read the mood at all.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s tell them to come hang out here sometime,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat should we report to the guild master?\u300d</p><br/><p>But instead, they were the ones who asked.</p><br/><p>I happily left a message for them to deliver.</p><br/><p>I admire adventurers. But, since I probably won\u2019t be able to avoid a background check, registering with the guild may prove hard for a monster.</p><br/><p>Thus, to repay his debt, Cabal will mention the name Rimuru to the guild master upon their return.</p><br/><p>Really, what a great guy.</p><br/><p>Being pleased with them, I decided to give them some parting gifts,</p><br/><p>Spider robe,</p><br/><p>Scalemail,</p><br/><p>Hard-leather armor,</p><br/><p>I handed to them those goods along with 10 pieces of the restoration medicine.</p><br/><p>\u300cWha!!! What\u2019s with this robe!!! So light, but sturdy! Actually, very sturdy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhoa!!! The famous Scalemail!!! Wait, isn\u2019t this master Garm\u2019s product?! I\u2019ll make it my family heirloom!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEeh! Is this fine? This is clearly wasted on someone like me. And to have used the skin of fang wolves\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>What to say, a noisier reaction than expect.</p><br/><p>And well, I gave it to them cause they lost their equipment in that fire, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy them replacements either.</p><br/><p>It was clearly not my fault, but I can sympathize a bit.</p><br/><p>And besides, what I gave them is naught but a test product.</p><br/><p>Which, of course, I won\u2019t tell them.</p><br/><p>Cause they are so happy with the gifts. No need to disappoint.</p><br/><p>No problem. No need to tell them either.</p><br/><p>Since, even as a test product, it\u2019s good quality!</p><br/><p>Well, if they are this happy, they\u2019ll definitely deliver the message.</p><br/><p>In the end, the three would call me Danna (Benefactor), and were quite attached.</p><br/><p>And although they did worry greatly for Shizu-san, they set off three days later.</p><br/><p>And a week had passed.</p><br/><p>Shizu-san has awoken.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is\u2026 I see\u2026 sorry for the trouble\u300d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s fully conscious.</p><br/><p>Seems like she clearly remembers her time as the demon.</p><br/><p>\u300cI saw a dream\u2026</p><br/><p>A nostalgic dream. Of a city\u2026 to which I can no longer return\u300d</p><br/><p>In Japan?</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Slime-san. Could you tell me your name?\u300d</p><br/><p>I thought I already introduced myself as Rimuru.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru\u300d</p><br/><p>She closed her eyes as if in deep thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cCould you tell me your real name?\u300d</p><br/><p>So she asked.</p><br/><p>Had she noticed? And after a moment of hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u300cFine. You won\u2019t last long anyways. It\u2019s Mikami Satoru.\u300d</p><br/><p>My real name. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say it again.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs I thought, you\u2019re Japanese, huh\u2026 I wondered if that was the case. That air you carry, you know\u300d</p><br/><p>Silence. And then,</p><br/><p>\u300cI also asked this of my disciples. What do you think became of that beautiful city? The one that turned into a sea of flames\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh. Let me show you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Having said so, I conveyed my memories with [Telepathic Communication].</p><br/><p>A truly useful skill at times like this.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>A tear rolled down her cheek. And,</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Slime-san\u2026 no, Satoru-san. Would you listen to my request?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>Probably some pointless request anyways.</p><br/><p>But, since I decided to look after her to the end, I can at least listen to her request.</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease eat me\u2026!\u300d</p><br/><p>What? What did this granny just say?</p><br/><p>\u300cYou ate the curse placed upon me\u2026 It made me so happy. Well, I did want to beat the guy who cursed me senseless, but\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, it would have been impossible for me.</p><br/><p>My last request. Could you put me to rest within yourself?</p><br/><p>You know, I\u2026 hated to be in this world. But, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hate this world\u2026 just like that guy\u2026</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a chance I someday\u2026 meet that guy again\u2026</p><br/><p>So, I don\u2019t want to be reborn in this world.</p><br/><p>Please. I beg you, eat me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmph.</p><br/><p>What a request. It\u2019s far too simple for me.</p><br/><p>For me to become her seal. For me, to succeed her hatred.</p><br/><p>Am I unsure? To put her heart at ease, and to send her off peacefully.. I made my decision.</p><br/><p>\u300cFine. I\u2019ll carry out your vengeance. What is his name? \u300d</p><br/><p>She opened her eyes wide to my question, revealing the burn marks, and with tears flowing down\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cLeon Cromwell. The strongest Demon Lord\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>As if in a prayer, she looks me in the eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cI swear! By the name Mikami Satoru\u2026 no, by the name Rimuru Tempest!</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll force Leon Cromwell to regret having incurred your hatred.\u300d</p><br/><p>Thank you\u2026 she muttered.</p><br/><p>And, she closed her eyes.

Another one seems to be Dino, the problem is the last person.</p><br/><p>I believe that the last one is probably Dagruel.</p><br/><p>Dagruel who is one of the Octagram as well as Ruminas.</p><br/><p>I think both of them are equal. But they only became equal because Ruminas had obtained an Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>Dagruel is a Demon Lord who has an abnormal power. The scale of his powers cannot be understood completely.</p><br/><p>If in contest of strength, it is certain that he would overpower Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Guessing from Vega\u2019s power, I\u2019m able to expect that Ruminas won\u2019t be able to win against Dagruel.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I sent over Shion and Adalman, two of the Guardian Lords, but......</p><br/><p>I still have this bad feeling that I can\u2019t shake off.</p><br/><p>I think that forcing me to fight Milim is not to buy time.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m relieved that Benimaru and Zegion will remain in Tempest, but I should not be careless.</p><br/><p>In the worst case, I need to prepare to make a move but a slight uneasiness passed through my mind.</p><br/><p>The next is that there is a question about Leon\u2019s confidence.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m certain that Kagali of the Four Fiends of the Heaven Commanders went towards Leon\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>Kagali and Leon also have a connection and I think that Kagali bears a grudge against Leon.</p><br/><p>The problem is the extent of Kagali\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Vega\u2019s power exceeds Ruminas\u2019.</p><br/><p>When compared to Leon, depending on the situation, I think that Leon would be defeated by Vega too.</p><br/><p>Vega has become abnormally strong to such a degree.</p><br/><p>If I assume that Kagali, who is on the same rank as Vega, became equally strong as him, Leon\u2019s victory will become questionable.</p><br/><p>Before the reinforcement request comes, thinking about some kind of countermeasures sounds good.</p><br/><p>I floated in the sky after I teleported and decided to watch the battle on the ground.</p><br/><p>Vega is fighting against Karion, but the situation is that Vega is overwhelmingly superior to Karion.</p><br/><p>I think there is a need to greatly revise the ability analysis result of the so called Four Fiends of the Heaven Commanders, Vega and Kagali.</p><br/><p>As I expected, there is a difference in obtaining information by seeing the fight directly versus from seeing it on the screen.</p><br/><p>For caution\u2019s sake, I contacted Guy with telepathy.</p><br/><p>I told him the current situation. Next I let him decide what he wants to do, let\u2019s believe that he will move appropriately.</p><br/><p>The time when Chloe and Guy meet is soon, let\u2019s have him do what he can currently.</p><br/><p>Just like that, when I finished all of the preparations, I calmly began to descend.</p><br/><p>It might be making me uneasy by letting other people handle everything, but I should believe in my subordinates.</p><br/><p>Using all of the cards I can use, even Ciel says that there is no other better strategies besides that.</p><br/><p>Under the present situation, there is nothing else that I can do.</p><br/><p>Then I\u2019ll do my work.</p><br/><p>The most important task in this place is to eliminate the person who is trying to manipulate Milim.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>At the moment when Rimuru arrived in the sky and gazed down with his eyes.</p><br/><p>Karion was in a hopeless battle.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuhaahhahahahaha!! Is the power of the Lion King only this much?</p><br/><p>It is so weak that I\u2019m speechless!</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t even reach my, this Vega-sama\u2019s feet, the true Beast King!</p><br/><p>How is it? I might make you a subordinate of mine if you kneel down and beg for your life.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHha! Don\u2019t make fun of me! This Karion has dedicated his loyalty to Milim-sama.</p><br/><p>I need not lower my head to be your petty underling!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow cheeky.</p><br/><p>Just like Milim, you\u2019re just a fang-less pet dog!</p><br/><p>Although I would spare your life if you served this great me, Vega-sama\u2026...</p><br/><p>You better regret the stupidity of your decision in the next world!\u300d</p><br/><p>Vega shouted such.</p><br/><p>And a compressed aura bullet of a 50 cm diameter surged up.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t receive that\u2019. Karion\u2019s instincts, which could be called super instincts, perceived the danger of the destructive power that aura bullet has.</p><br/><p>Even if he promptly evaded it, Vega seems like he will not allow him to do so.</p><br/><p>Aiming at Karion, Vega continuously shoots the aura bullets.</p><br/><p>\u300cDamn it\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!\u300d</p><br/><p>As he shouts, Karion put all of his magic power into the deployed Aura Shield in front of him.</p><br/><p>Of course, he understands that he would die if it hit him directly. He adds some angle on the Aura Shield with repelling the aura bullets in mind.</p><br/><p>Because of Milim\u2019s intensive training, the means of dealing with an enemy who has more destructive and stronger power than him had been hammered into him more than needed.</p><br/><p>Rather, he doesn\u2019t have any memories of it stopping no matter how much he shouted for it to stop.</p><br/><p>Milim laughed, but she didn\u2019t stop\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The result of that special training saves Karion now.</p><br/><p>His magic power is depleted greatly but he has somehow managed to survive. The repelled aura bullets, transforming the surroundings\u2019 terrain with their destructive power.</p><br/><p>Karion believes that just the fact that he was able to endure them somehow, is praiseworthy.</p><br/><p>Under the cover of the smoke caused by the explosions, he slipped into a newly created crater. He hid himself in the shadow and suppressed his breath.</p><br/><p>(Good grief, what the heck is with that power\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If Milim was not my opponent during the combat training, I might already be done for right now \u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>He thought about such things.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he remembered his friend who trained together with him.</p><br/><p>(Wait! You\u2019ll die-ssu! If you take more than this, you\u2019ll seriously die-ssu!!)</p><br/><p>That guy had always been next to him and had yelled that.</p><br/><p>And even though that guy said \u2018I\u2019m at my limit, it\u2019s impossible\u2019, he kept Karion company until the end of the training while being lively.</p><br/><p>(Damn! I\u2019m still okay. I will get laughed at by that guy if I admit my defeat here!)</p><br/><p>Karion grinned widely and laughed.</p><br/><p>Karion\u2019s power, which had risen greatly as a result of Milim\u2019s training, is clearly shown during the fight.</p><br/><p>He remembered Milim\u2019s words, \u201cThe most important thing is, don\u2019t die!\u201d.</p><br/><p>Just like that, he is now able to understand what Milim said.</p><br/><p>When fighting against a stronger opponent, first ascertain the enemy\u2019s strength, then prioritize survival over everything else.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, his subordinates seem to have left the vicinity of this area in accordance with his aide\u2019s orders. Afraid of getting involved in the battle, the angels also didn\u2019t approach this area.</p><br/><p>Vega didn\u2019t manage the angels in a skillful manner, if he was smart, he would make them surround and annihilate Karion and he would be dead by now.</p><br/><p>But Vega hasn\u2019t given any orders to his subordinates because he is confident with his own strength.</p><br/><p>(There might be a chance for victory. Anyways, I need to endure. And then, wait for my chance\u30fc\u30fc)</p><br/><p>Karion doesn\u2019t give up.</p><br/><p>He need to draw out the enemy\u2019s forces and expose their power, giving Milim the advantage.</p><br/><p>He will leave the rest to Milim, who is the leader.</p><br/><p>He was anxious because of what Frey said, but he needs to do what he can do right now with all of his effort.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch! How sly!! You\u2019re just a coward who only has hiding in your brain.</p><br/><p>What is with the title \u2018Lion King\u2019? Rat is a more appropriate title for a coward like you!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a strategy, strategy. You who are dumb may not be able to understand it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Karion shouted back to Vega\u2019s provocation.</p><br/><p>He won\u2019t get provoked.</p><br/><p>Making use of the echo, Karion used tricks so Vega can\u2019t know where he is.</p><br/><p>Baited by the voice, Vega shot a series of magic bullets at the places that had nothing.</p><br/><p>Compared to the simple aura bullet from a while ago, the power was higher. The surrounding terrain wasn\u2019t just altered, but hollowed and annihilated.</p><br/><p>It seems very unlikely for Karion to be able to endure many of them if he received them directly, because of the power they have.</p><br/><p>Vega just threw them without accumulating them, yet they have the power to alter the landscape.</p><br/><p>It was more than the kneaded magic bullets. If he face it upright, his magic power will be run out in a moment.</p><br/><p>If it goes badly, he fears that he will receive an attack which won\u2019t leave him any chance to recover.</p><br/><p>He could feel the pressure in the hand which wield the Byakko-Seiryuu Lance. Because it seemed the situation will become worse if he lost his composure here.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s considering using his trump card,\u300eBeastification[1]\u300f.</p><br/><p>At the same time of this ability activation, all the damage he received from before that would be completely restored, and all of his energy would also be restored.</p><br/><p>Then with the large rise of his fighting power, it\u2019s possible for him to raise the limit of his abilities.</p><br/><p>During Milim\u2019s special training, Karion acquired the Unique Skill \u300eLion Heart\u300f.</p><br/><p>This ability increases his power against a person stronger than him and gives his attacks penetration effect.</p><br/><p>And using it together with\u300eBeastification\u300f, results as an Original Skill\u300eDragon Body[2]\u300f.</p><br/><p>An indomitable heart and an unyielding body.</p><br/><p>He had acquired a strong and unparalleled power.</p><br/><p>However......</p><br/><p>(In order to win against this guy, I have no other choice than to use Original Skill\u300eDragon Body\u300f, but it\u2019s time limit is a mere 10 minutes......)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>It is an incomparable ability that can be thought to be an invincible power, but after 10 minutes passes and all of the magic power runs out, the transformation would come undone.</p><br/><p>In the current situation, he would be defeated overwhelmingly if he only using Unique Skill\u300eLion Heart\u300f. Karion wants to refrain from using\u300eBeastification\u300funtil he receives a big damage, but once he uses it, he won\u2019t be able to use the Unique Skill\u300eLion Heart\u300f.</p><br/><p>He would be defeated in the case that he doesn\u2019t defeat Vega during the 10 minutes of him using it.</p><br/><p>Because without the correction effect against a stronger opponent of Unique Skill\u300eLion Heart\u300f he might not be able to fight back with only the strengthening of\u300eBeastification\u300f.</p><br/><p>He has confirmed that Vega has a super-regeneration ability.</p><br/><p>Is he sure he can win? So long as he doesn\u2019t see Vega\u2019s weakness, he can\u2019t use his trump card. However, losing without fighting back, he judged that he must dodge for it to happen.</p><br/><p>\u300cStrategy, strategy you said? Fuhahahahaha, you make me laugh.</p><br/><p>A small fry like you should know your place and stop thinking for nothing!!</p><br/><p>Well\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s easy to kill you, but should I teach you what despair is?</p><br/><p>This yours truly hasn\u2019t used any abilities yet. Do you understand what that means?</p><br/><p>Because you may not be able to understand it, I will show you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying as much, Vega put one of his hands to the front.</p><br/><p>The corpses which had fallen down to the ground began gathering and uniting, as they transformed into a decaying wicked life-form.</p><br/><p>Then, it easily shot down the angels who are flying in the sky, as they became the prey to the life-form which was just born.</p><br/><p>This is the moment where a horrifying creature was born into this world.</p><br/><p>The wings of raptors[3] grew on the wriggling wicked humanoid form.</p><br/><p>However, it lacks the light of intellect in its eyes. Because, in the first place, it has no head. But, it seems to possess\u300eMagic Power Perception\u300fand be able to grasp the surroundings accurately.</p><br/><p>If it was named, it should be called an Evil Dragon Beast.</p><br/><p>Vega activated the ultimate power that he himself got, the Ultimate Skill\u300eEvil Dragon Lord Azi Dahaka\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuhaahhahahahaha!! How is it, this lovely pet of mine!!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a waste to use this kind of fighting power against small fries like you all. All of you should fully enjoy it!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Vega laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>In total, there were four evil dragon beasts that were born.</p><br/><p>They ate the angels and took their power, although they are distorted creatures, their combat ability is high.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey hey\u2026... are you serious\u2026..\u300d</p><br/><p>Karion\u2019s super instincts rings an alarm.</p><br/><p>His instincts tells him that they might be just as strong as Clayman who was a former Demon Lord just like him.</p><br/><p>However, Vega who created such creatures didn\u2019t seem to have his power decreased.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s unknown how many of them Vega can create, but they might get increased later. Just like the angels.</p><br/><p>The adjutant had splendidly taken command so there were not many casualties and thus it only produced 4 enemies.</p><br/><p>(These wicked fiends, I need to quickly annihilate them, how can I let my subordinates see such things!?)</p><br/><p>Karion shuddered, their repulsiveness made him nauseous as anger filled his heart. He said something like he had room to spare, and didn\u2019t seem too unwilling.</p><br/><p>\u300cGo!! Lure the rat who\u2019s hiding and trying to run!! \u300d</p><br/><p>In accordance to the order, they started acting at a terrific speed.</p><br/><p>The ground was kicked, the air fluttered, and the surrounding smoke was blown away.</p><br/><p>When it came to this, it was only a matter of time that they would notice Karion, who is hiding in a hollow.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tch!\u2019 so he clicked his tongue. Karion condensing his own magic power and let out a Beast Roar (Beast Magic Particle Cannon) at one of them, which was approaching him from the front.</p><br/><p>He judged that if such fiends were mass-produced, if he tried to buy more time, even more distant he will be from his advantageous situation.</p><br/><p>It is not the time to be asking for chance.</p><br/><p>One of the evil dragon beasts was burnt up by the Beast Roar that Karion let out.</p><br/><p>The terrific destructive power of the magic particle cannon didn\u2019t lose it\u2019s might even after burning the evil dragon beast, it continues straight on towards Vega.</p><br/><p>It is as Karion planned. As it\u2019s a attack from a blind spot, it will be a direct hit.</p><br/><p>However, the distance was slightly too far.</p><br/><p>The power was reduced by half at around 300m, so it\u2019s better to shoot it from more of a point-blank range.</p><br/><p>As Karion became stronger than before, the beast roar became a perfected, highly effective, special move. So, the distance he is able to shoot from increased, and he can also shorten the preparation time for it\u2019s firing, but the range hasn\u2019t increased.</p><br/><p>Right now, the power doesn\u2019t decline until 200m but the power deteriorates no matter what when it reaches the 300m mark.</p><br/><p>Even so, there\u2019s no complaint from him as it has improved greatly as a result of the special training but\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s unlikely for it to be a telling blow in the current situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuwaahhahahahaha!! How crafty! Is this your strategy?</p><br/><p>Yours truly doesn\u2019t even feel any particular pain or itch from such an attack!!\u300d</p><br/><p>While laughing, Vega provoked Karion.</p><br/><p>However, the area which received the direct hit suffered a major burn, to say that he didn\u2019t receive damage, it doesn\u2019t seem like it.</p><br/><p>\u300cHa! Don\u2019t pretend to endure it! If it\u2019s painful, you can cry you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Karion dashed quickly while returning the provocation with a provocation.</p><br/><p>Towards the second evil dragon beast who notices Karion and was coming closer, he shot a beast roar with his left hand and dealt the killing blow with the Byakko-Seiryuu Lance loaded with kneaded aura.</p><br/><p>The evil dragon beast whose stance was broken to evade the beast roar was destroyed without being able to react.</p><br/><p>(Next is the other two of them!)</p><br/><p>In Karion\u2019s field of vision, he was able to see that two of them were coming together at a run.</p><br/><p>If Karion was the apex of a triangle. The two beasts formed the tips of the sides, and Vega was in the center of the base[4].</p><br/><p>If he adjusted his position, his special skill would get an even line of fire.</p><br/><p>The length of the side is around 100m, Vega is letting his guard down as he was underestimating Karion.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a chance.</p><br/><p>(Eureka!![5])</p><br/><p>Karion condensed all of his magic power while thanking for the good luck, and refined his demonic fighting aura[6].</p><br/><p>While concentrating so that the power wouldn\u2019t leak out, Karion poured it all into his Byakko-Seiryuu Lance. He waited until the demonic fighting aura was refined to its limit, he chose to gather it to the tip of his Byakko-Seiryuu Lance and turned it into a terrific power.</p><br/><p>\u300cUoooooooo!! Take this! Diffusion Roar[7]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The flash divided into nine and ran through.</p><br/><p>Each target was to be pierced by three lights. Although it\u2019s power is equal to the single shot Beast Roar, as it was spread out, it was a sure kill attack that shoots through the target from various angles.</p><br/><p>The convergence of the three lights slightly exceed the power of the single shot Beast Roar because of its synergy. This is the true special move that Karion created.</p><br/><p>\u300cHha! Serves you right. Because you looked down on someone, you will suffer like this!\u300d</p><br/><p>Karion spat those words out towards Vega.</p><br/><p>The two evil dragon beasts seemed to be annihilated, but Vega seems to have stopped the attack.</p><br/><p>Karion needed to step in to finish him off.</p><br/><p>Both Vega\u2019s arms were blown off and his whole body suffered a severe burn, there was also a large hole in both of his flanks.</p><br/><p>Normally it would be a fatal wound, but for such a troublesome monster like him, it would be fine, so long as he still has a piece of his cell.</p><br/><p>Thinking as much, Karion gathered up his remaining magic power and was going to shoot a Beast Roar as the finisher.</p><br/><p>However\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>The evil dragon beast which should have been bisected drew near, unnoticed, from Karion\u2019s rear and attacked him.</p><br/><p>The evil dragon beast must also have a dreadful regenerative ability.</p><br/><p>Give it a little time and it will revive even when bisected into two.</p><br/><p>In addition,</p><br/><p>\u300cGuhaahhahahahaha!! Did I say it was crafty?</p><br/><p>Someone like you are not an opponent for me but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It was troublesome when you were sneaking and hiding.</p><br/><p>I lured you out with me as the decoy!</p><br/><p>How is it? This is a strategy you know!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Grrrhhh\u2026..!!</p><br/><p>Despair struck Karion.</p><br/><p>Vega showed a supercilious smile to Karion.</p><br/><p>And then, his injuries were restored in but a moment, the traces of the serious injury was nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>From the beginning, he was not hurt.</p><br/><p>(Damn it! I was had by this guy\u2026\u2026!)</p><br/><p>Though it was frustrating, Karion couldn\u2019t help but to admit that Vega\u2019s abilities are far stronger than he expected.</p><br/><p>At Karion, who Vega was looking down on like he was looking at trash, he shot a large magic bullet.</p><br/><p>He intended to get rid of Karion, without minding the evil dragon beast who was pinning Karion down from behind rear.</p><br/><p>The moment the magic bullet was shot, Karion desperately mustered his strength to take evasive action.</p><br/><p>He managed to avoided a direct hit, but he did lose the left side of his body.</p><br/><p>He is alive, barely.</p><br/><p>As Karion is the king of the beastmen, he has a high vitality. He won\u2019t die to this degree.</p><br/><p>However, he believes it would be hard to make a comeback from this situation.</p><br/><p>(Damn\u2026\u2026 is this the end, huh?)</p><br/><p>He wanted to think that he would survive till the end, but he doesn\u2019t seem to have any other choice.</p><br/><p>The rest he can only gamble for with his last resort.</p><br/><p>For the remaining 10 minutes, he will perform his full offensive attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have no choice but to fight using my Original Skill \u300eDragon Body\u300f.\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought so.</p><br/><p>All of his injuries will be completely heal and his magic power will be restored too. However, all left is defeat.</p><br/><p>But, he will die regardless as things are now, there is no choice but to do it.</p><br/><p>Karion resolved himself.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t underestimate me! I will show you a man\u2019s way of life!!\u300d</p><br/><p>So he shouted.</p><br/><p>Vega was smirking and making an unpleasant jeer, his eyes were as if he was looking down at a defeated dog.</p><br/><p>Such looks filled Karion with anger and he was able to forget the pain.</p><br/><p>At the moment he was about to activate his ability,</p><br/><p>\u300cWai~ttt, please wait-ssu! Hero is the one who always comes late-ssu!!\u300d</p><br/><p>A stupid voice was heard.</p><br/><p>A dear friend of his, who was so out of place to the extent of the ridiculous.</p><br/><p>What jumped out of Karion\u2019s shadow is one Hobgoblin.</p><br/><p>Without any mistake, it\u2019s his dear friend, he, the genius (best friend) who Karion acknowledges.</p><br/><p>That person\u2019s name is Gobuta.</p><br/><p>He is the 13th man who can dissolve this critical situation.</p><br/><p>[1] Actually the ability is written as  (Juu Majin Ka) which can be translate as Beast Majin/Devil Transformation, also  is the race of Karion\u2019s aide which I left as beastman before, also about Milim being the Ultimate Dragonoid from the chapters before it used majin too (Ryuumajin) like the one from Dai no Daibouken. Well majin is a bit hard to translate actually~</p><br/><p>Should I keep it as it now or changed them?</p><br/><p>Any suggestions are welcome.</p><br/><p>[2] Written as , Dragonic Lion Body but was read as Dragon Body.</p><br/><p>[3] No, it\u2019s not the dinosaur one.

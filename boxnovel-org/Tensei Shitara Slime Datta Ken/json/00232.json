Those two were squaring off against the \u201cBerserk Evil Dragon\u201d Zero and repelled his attacks.</p><br/><p>Their aim was to get outside the labyrinth, in other words to escape from Zero\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh man, this is going on forever\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino grumbled while annihilating the attacking Zero\u2019s clones with Deep Bullet[1].</p><br/><p>Zero seemed to be able to make his clones endlessly with the acquired power he had as he fused completely with the isolated labyrinth.</p><br/><p>As each of the clones had the same strength as Zero before he evolved, and they could regenerate numerous times.</p><br/><p>Even if the clones were killed, it was meaningless as their corpses could revive.</p><br/><p>After all, since Zero\u2019s main body was the labyrinth itself, he could absorb all the energy used inside the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>\u300cAny emission type techniques are meaningless. You should know that such actions benefit the enemy more.\u300d</p><br/><p>Zegion warned Dino while he minced Zero\u2019s clones with his shining wings.</p><br/><p>Zegion pulverized his enemy with his new ability \u201cCrumbling Wings, Kuzuha[2]\u201d by vibrating his wings. By generating directional high frequency waves which cut everything that they came in contact with.</p><br/><p>Moreover, by combining it with Zegion\u2019s magic power, it was possible to change its property depending on the enemy\u2019s wave.</p><br/><p>In addition to All Heaven Sight, Zegion had acquired the means to attack in all directions, it could be said that his blind spot had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Even with all of that, Zegion had never used any emission type abilities ever since he joined forces with Dino.</p><br/><p>He handled the incoming enemies with direct blows and slashes of his wings.</p><br/><p>The reason was the aforementioned labyrinth\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Zegion was familiar with its nature as he was its strongest guardian.</p><br/><p>Dino\u2019s energy was enormous, his total energy surpassed Zegion\u2019s.</p><br/><p>However, that didn\u2019t mean it was inexhaustible.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a problem for Dino to shoot tens of thousands of magic bullets, but it would be a different story as all of the energy was absorbed by the enemy.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously? Then, does that mean Zero is applying Ramiris\u2019 labyrinth power on himself?\u300d</p><br/><p>Zegion answered Dino\u2019s question by silently nodding.</p><br/><p>Looking at Zegion, Dino immediately depressed.</p><br/><p>Zero\u2019s clones could regenerate until the labyrinth\u2019s energy ran out. The clones\u2019 ability was equally the same as if Multiple Existence was used.</p><br/><p>All of the Zeros were moving under the same drive.</p><br/><p>The only saving grace was that they couldn\u2019t use techniques since Zero\u2019s ego had collapsed.</p><br/><p>However, a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d is still a true dragon class.</p><br/><p>Looking at only his energy, it was a terrifying thing to be felt as he easily surpassed Dino\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Ramiris! Does the labyrinth have any weakness? They keep reviving no matter how many times we kill them, you know!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t be stupid! My labyrinth has no such thing as a weakness!</p><br/><p>Inside the Infinite Floors, communication to the outside is sealed. Such a thing as escaping would be impossible!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cIdiot! Don\u2019t brag!! Then, how can you communicate with us right now? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eAhh, that\u2019s because\u2015\u2015\u300f</p><br/><p>According to Ramiris\u2019 explanation, the inside of the \u201cBerserk Evil Dragon\u201d Zero, the labyrinth itself, was a completely isolated space.</p><br/><p>It became a subspace where communication was impossible, whether it was with\u300eTelepathy\u300for\u300eThought Transmission\u300f.</p><br/><p>However, by following Rimuru\u2019s instructions as he had predicted this predicament, the countermeasures were perfect.</p><br/><p>This time, it was possible to communicate through Zegion.</p><br/><p>Exchanging information became possible through the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d between Zegion and Rimuru.</p><br/><p>And so, the connection of this \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d became the key to escape from the \u201dBerserk Evil Dragon\u201d Zero\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn other words, we weren\u2019t walking around aimlessly\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino was relieved hearing Ramiris\u2019 explanation as he was tired of continuing to walk through seemingly endless passages without any sign of an exit.</p><br/><p>Dino\u2019s swords cut the approaching Zero\u2019s clones and tentacles that grew from the ground and wall.</p><br/><p>His twin swords, the Holy Sword and the Demonic Sword, were shining and clad in white and black aura respectively.</p><br/><p>In order to suppress the release of energy, Dino changed his fighting style to cladding his swords with fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>Dino appeared to repel the enemy easily, but that was because his sword skills were excellent.</p><br/><p>Although Zero lost his ego, there was no doubt that Zero was dangerous as he was attacking out of instinct.</p><br/><p>Because Dino was abnormally strong, as if he went through an uninhabited plain, the enemies couldn\u2019t get close to Dino.</p><br/><p>There was needless to say about his companion, Zegion.</p><br/><p>Dino and Zegion walked side by side and disposed of any hindrances.</p><br/><p>Pico was walking in the center while carrying Gaia, Garasha was responsible for being vigilant and protecting their rear.</p><br/><p>Saving their energy as much as possible and dealing with everything with just swords was much harder than they had thought.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t mean they got tired physically, but it was more of a mental fatigue.</p><br/><p>Although Dino thought that it would be better to stay put in one place which was easy to defend without moving around, as it was useless even if they defeated the enemies\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>According to Ramiris, such an action wasn\u2019t futile, but it would be best for them to head towards the nearest outer wall.</p><br/><p>In the first place, it wasn\u2019t a good idea to stay in one place because they were inside the enemy\u2019s playing field where the area itself could be rearranged freely by the enemy.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, that\u2019s the reason, so can you guys go towards the designated point?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cGot it. So, what do we do when we get there?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eLet loose. Use your strongest attacks, and escape through the wall with full power!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026we can do that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eWhether you can or can\u2019t doesn\u2019t matter, just do it. Besides, there\u2019s no other way to escape, you know?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, okay.\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino judged that it was useless to ask any further.</p><br/><p>Since Ramiris said there was no other way, he guessed he had no other choice but to do it.</p><br/><p>What left was whether it was possible or not.</p><br/><p>Because it was their strongest attack, they probably didn\u2019t need to consider the energy consumption.</p><br/><p>Because there was no need to worry about a little consumption as long as they passed through the wall.</p><br/><p>Now, it was about how much power was needed for it.</p><br/><p>Dino pondered about his abilities.</p><br/><p>First of all was the Ultimate Skill\u300eSlothful Lord Belphegor\u300f, which he had acquired without his permission even though he had no intention to gain it.</p><br/><p>It was a skill specialized in mental attacks.</p><br/><p>By incorporating the Perception Obstruction of the Ultimate Skill\u300eSlothful Lord Belphegor\u300f, Dino strengthened the unfamiliar great sword he used into a phantasmagoric sword which he could transform freely.</p><br/><p>Its affinity with Dino\u2019s current dual swords needed no mention.</p><br/><p>However, its effect was weak against someone in a rampage state like Zero. It was very unfortunate that\u300eSlothful Lord Belphegor\u300fwasn\u2019t useful.</p><br/><p>He also thought of unleashing the full power of his abilities, but if that failed he won\u2019t have another chance. Dino deemed it would be better to reserve it as his trump card.</p><br/><p>Then what should he do?</p><br/><p>(Guess I have no other choice but to use it\u2026...)</p><br/><p>Dino sighed as he gave up and decided to use his last resort which he wanted to keep hidden.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Inside the control room, Ramiris and the others were also very busy dealing with the situation.</p><br/><p>As it was unclear whether Dino deemed Velda as an enemy or not, they were preparing the countermeasures for both situations.</p><br/><p>If Dino teamed up with Zero and let himself be eaten, they had planned to release the isolated part into the\u300eInfinite Corridor\u300f.</p><br/><p>But, if Dino became an ally, they had to help him escape from inside of Zero safely.</p><br/><p>If it was just Zegion, the plan was to forcibly do space transfer based on his location information via \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d and escape.</p><br/><p>Using an attack to punch a hole through the wall momentarily, it would be possible to transfer to the outside through that gap.</p><br/><p>However, in order to escape together with Dino\u2019s group, they had to make a big hole in the wall.</p><br/><p>To transfer in an unstable state was dangerous.</p><br/><p>It would be fine if it was just Dino, but as Pico and Garasha were weaker when compared to Zegion and Dino, it was doubtful whether they would be able to endure the transfer through the subspace outside the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it was necessary for the preparation to be in a perfect situation.</p><br/><p>Besides, there was another problem.</p><br/><p>Zero had evolved into a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>Although Rimuru had informed them about the possibility, because Rimuru\u2019s words were vague like\u300eHmm, it would be alright, probably.\u300f, they thought it wasn\u2019t an important matter.</p><br/><p>In the unlikely event that such a situation became reality, they were to contact him immediately.</p><br/><p>So, while Ramiris became Zegion and co\u2019s navigation[3], Benimaru was contacting Rimuru.</p><br/><p>And so, the operators inside the control room accomplished their works following the manual provided beforehand.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. Unbelievable, for a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d to be really born!</p><br/><p>As expected of Rimuru-sama, it looks like he had predicted everything.\u300d</p><br/><p>An excited laughter echoed inside the control room.</p><br/><p>It came from Diablo.</p><br/><p>Rimuru had ordered him to go to the control room.</p><br/><p>Diablo instructed the operators, who were panicking to stand up, to continue their work as they were with his hand.</p><br/><p>To the demon operators, Diablo was terrifying as usual.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Diablo. You\u2019re so fast.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. There would be no problem in ignoring Zero, if his evolution ended after he fused with the labyrinth\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>However, since he has become a new \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d, we can\u2019t leave him alone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s for sure. However, I have heard about the possibility, yet I\u2019m still surprised\u2026..</p><br/><p>As expected of Rimuru-sama, he had predicted things this far.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you saying. That goes without saying.</p><br/><p>Leaving that aside, Benimaru-dono, it looks like your recovery is still insufficient.</p><br/><p>Let me give you some of my energy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019ll be helpful. I thought that my recovery rate was insufficient if I want to destroy that.\u300d</p><br/><p>The amount Benimaru had recovered was less than half.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Diablo transferred his energy to him.</p><br/><p>It was an impossible method for everyone else, but it was possible for Diablo who could manipulate the energy of Rimuru\u2019s\u300eNihility Collapse[4]\u300f.</p><br/><p>While watching those two, Ramiris said,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe only members here who can move in that space are Diablo, Zegion and Benimaru.</p><br/><p>Benimaru, you can use \u300eSpace-Time Control\u300fproperly right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCertainly, Ramiris-sama. Although I only just got the hang of it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay then! With this, all of the cards have been assembled, I guess?[5]</p><br/><p>We might need to call Master or Rimuru if Dino didn\u2019t join our side.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cVeldora-sama might be busy right now. He probably can\u2019t spare any of his time for that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see~. Well then, I will have to make you guys work hard.</p><br/><p>It would be bad if we didn\u2019t make Dino come to his senses!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufufu. That is exactly as planned.</p><br/><p>Rimuru-sama believed that Dino-sama would join our side.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected of Rimuru. Well, I also believed that Dino will change his mind!\u300d</p><br/><p>Even while Ramiris was gleefully talking with Diablo, everyone was working without stopping.</p><br/><p>And so, the preparations were finally complete.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, are you guys ready? Okay then, let the final plan begin~!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Along with Ramiris\u2019 command, the final plan was set into motion.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Dino and co reached the point designated by Ramiris.</p><br/><p>All that's left for them was to act together with the signal.</p><br/><p>Ramiris began explaining to Dino and co.</p><br/><p>\u300eOkay? First, you guys need to escape from there.</p><br/><p>I want you guys to pierce the wall using medium-level power.</p><br/><p>Then, the two people over there and Gaia will jump out with Zegion and Dino\u2019s barrier protecting them.</p><br/><p>After that, you guys have to return back after destroying that abominable evil dragon!\u300f</p><br/><p>Dino was staring in puzzlement.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t understand the content of the words Ramiris said.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u201dMedium?\u201d Dino didn\u2019t understand the meaning of it.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u201dDestroying that abominable Evil Dragon\uff1f\u201d He had no idea how.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey. HEY HEY HEY HEY! WAIT PLEASE!</p><br/><p>What are you saying? You\u2019re counting me as a member of the evil dragon subjugation, aren\u2019t you!?\u300d</p><br/><p>He wanted to ask about the Medium-thingy, but the evil dragon subjugation was a bigger problem than it.</p><br/><p>Dino objected in panic, he didn\u2019t want to be made as a member without his consent.</p><br/><p>However, such a thing won\u2019t work on Ramiris.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey you.</p><br/><p>You could prostrate before me in order to get my forgiveness, right?</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t score some good points here, I wonder what will happen\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>You won\u2019t be able to imagine it, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino had no other choice but to submit to Ramiris\u2019 threats.</p><br/><p>In addition to being an opponent he couldn\u2019t triumph against in a quarrel since the olden days, Dino was in a weak spot this time.</p><br/><p>Dino tearfully steeled himself.</p><br/><p>\u300cGot it. Then, what do you mean about medium?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eYou don\u2019t even know about that?</p><br/><p>It means to use enough of your power to make a hole in the wall but don\u2019t use up all of your power!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cWait! Like hell I could understand such vague explanations\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Besides, you said to go full power before!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eAaah, geez! You\u2019re so noisy about such trivial things\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mind the minor details, go open a hole in the wall and escape.</p><br/><p>After you escape, save a portion of your power for your strongest attack to destroy that evil dragon!\u300f</p><br/><p>Dino was being prattled on by Ramiris one-sidedly.</p><br/><p>In short, he could understand that what she was trying to say was to break the wall while saving enough power to attack the evil dragon.</p><br/><p>(Good grief, she\u2019s really irresponsible. As if I could say this, though.)</p><br/><p>It seemed that two people who behave alike could get along surprisingly well with each other.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, let\u2019s escape quickly!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino leisurely took a stance.</p><br/><p>He no longer thought of being stingy with using his ability.</p><br/><p>Now, what he needed to do was to match his timing with Zegion to Pico and Garasha, and break the wall.</p><br/><p>\u300eGood, protect them with your barrier properly, okay?</p><br/><p>Otherwise, they would get swallowed up by the subspace and get blown away to no one knows where!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino nodded to Ramiris\u2019 warning.</p><br/><p>Aside from Zegion who was connected via \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d, Dino and co who didn\u2019t have firm bonds, had no foothold inside the subspace.</p><br/><p>Still, Dino could manage it somehow, but he predicted that Pico and Garasha would get swept away easily by the subspace.</p><br/><p>If they were swallowed up by the phase fluctuation inside the subspace, it would be impossible to predict what kind of different dimension and space they would get blown into.</p><br/><p>Because it was a different space where the flow of time could get distorted, it would be hopeless to return to the same spot once you got swept away.</p><br/><p>Even for Pico and Garasha who were of the awakened demon lord class, it would be difficult for them to maintain their existences inside the subspace.</p><br/><p>The minimum requirement for that was to own the\u300eSpace-Time Control\u300fskill.</p><br/><p>It was an ultimate ability that nobody else had apart from Diablo, Zegion and Benimaru, who finally could use it.</p><br/><p>\u300cListen, you two wouldn\u2019t be able to move inside the subspace.</p><br/><p>Therefore, grab onto me tightly, okay? I think you can\u2019t come back once you get swept away.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood. I probably won\u2019t die, but I don\u2019t know where I will end up going to.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDino, can I trust you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLeave it to me. Now that we\u2019ve come this far, we just have to do it.\u300d</p><br/><p>The three of them were having such a conversation.</p><br/><p>At that time, Zegion took out something from his\u300eSpace Warehouse[6]\u300fand offered it to Dino.</p><br/><p>\u300cTake it.\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino took it as he was coerced by Zegion\u2019s attitude that won\u2019t let him say yes or no.</p><br/><p>It was a small, round orb.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh, this thing is the pseudo core[7] that Rimuru uses to play, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino\u2019s question was met with silence.</p><br/><p>It seemed Zegion had no intention to answer it.</p><br/><p>While Dino was grumbling quietly\u300cOkay, whatever\u2026\u2026\u300dwith sad eyes, he tucked the orb into his pocket.</p><br/><p>The preparation was complete.</p><br/><p>Things won\u2019t end just with escaping; there would be work to do afterwards.</p><br/><p>Dino understood this well and paid close attention so that his power distribution won\u2019t be wrong.</p><br/><p>And then\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>At the same time with Ramiris\u2019 signal, the four people inside Zero released their power.</p><br/><p>[1] (\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8) Noushuku Maryokudan (Diipu Buretto) Condensed Magic Bullet.</p><br/><p>[2] (\u30af\u30ba\u30cf) Houhane/Kuzuha.

So his instincts screamed.</p><br/><p>Currently, the pack did not lack provision.</p><br/><p>If people were attacked and eaten, they were more of a snack.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because humans aren\u2019t born with a lot of inherent magical energy.</p><br/><p>For the Fang Wolves, a meal was nothing more than absorbing magical energy.</p><br/><p>Fight strong monsters or slaughter many humans, and evolve into a calamity class monster.</p><br/><p>But as things stand, neither method seemed very plausible.</p><br/><p>The Empire was simply far too strong.</p><br/><p>However, should they simply continue attacking merchants, their goal will be but a dream within a dream.</p><br/><p>But they have heard of a paradise for powerful monsters\u2013a forest set on blessed lands far in the south.</p><br/><p>However, to reach those lands, they\u2019d have to traverse the Jura Forest.</p><br/><p>The inhabitants of which aren\u2019t anything special.</p><br/><p>The many times they hunted those of them that ventured into the plains proved this point.</p><br/><p>In that case, why have they not invaded the forest yet?</p><br/><p>\u201cStorm Dragon Veldora\u201d</p><br/><p>The existence of that dragon is the reason.</p><br/><p>Even while he was sealed away, the ominous energy he emitted was enough to frighten them into submission.</p><br/><p>They were convinced that the forest\u2019s inhabitants received Veldora\u2019s protection.</p><br/><p>And that is why the can live inside that fiendish aura.</p><br/><p>Had they believed otherwise, they would surely go mad.</p><br/><p>Until now, they lived with these shameful thoughts, and held back their urge to invade\u2026 Yes! Until now!</p><br/><p>The Pack Leaders looks into the forest with his blood red, sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>That despised, evil dragon\u2019s presence had vanished.</p><br/><p>Now, they could freely ravage through the forest, and become its supreme rulers! Oh, the very thought whet his appetite.</p><br/><p>And so, he howled the order to advance!</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Having become the guardian, I contemplated the next step.</p><br/><p>Personally, even with that title, I think their treatment of me is too grandiose.</p><br/><p>In any case, I gathered and studied the goblins\u2019 fighters.</p><br/><p>\u2026 They are practically falling apart.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t seem like I can depend on them during combat.</p><br/><p>Also, the remaining goblins, kids and elderly, came to observe our preparation.</p><br/><p>No reinforcement from other tribes, either.</p><br/><p>As things stand, it\u2019s a small miracle that the chief hasn\u2019t lost his mind yet.</p><br/><p>Because even if they run away, they\u2019d just die from hunger or thirst\u2026</p><br/><p>And, the goblins whom I gathered are staring me as if at a deity\u2026</p><br/><p>What a heavy burden I took up.</p><br/><p>Feels especially so since I just wanted to lead a carefree life away from responsibility.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you all understand the situation?\u300d</p><br/><p>Not the kind of atmosphere to make a joke, and I don\u2019t have any good words of encouragement, so I went straight to the point.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! This shall become the fight to decide whether we live or die! We have already said our prayers!\u300d</p><br/><p>The goblin leader was the first to reply.</p><br/><p>The rest nodded in approval.</p><br/><p>And while there are some with trembling knees, that\u2019s only to be expected. Heart might be willing, but the flesh is weak\u2013something like that.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t get so worked up\u2013relax. Even those eager may face defeat. Just focus on doing your best!\u300d</p><br/><p>Tried saying something cool.</p><br/><p>I, at least, felt better, so maybe it\u2019ll have some effect.</p><br/><p>In any case, should we begin?</p><br/><p>Failure will most likely result in the goblins\u2019 certain demise.</p><br/><p>But still, I chose to be \u201cGoing My Way\u201d about this. (TL Note: reference to a 1944 film)</p><br/><p>Ahead, with arrogance! That\u2019s my choice.</p><br/><p>Alright! \u201cPut your spirit into it!\u201d That is the first order I gave them.</p><br/><p>And from then on, many more orders will follow.</p><br/><p>Those words announced that the moment has come!</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>And the sun had set.</p><br/><p>The Fang Wolves\u2019 pack leader awoke.</p><br/><p>That night was a full moon. The perfect witness to their battle.</p><br/><p>He slowly awoke his flesh, and gazed over his dominion.</p><br/><p>The pack, seeing their leader like that, bated their breath.</p><br/><p>How tensely they await.</p><br/><p>So thought the leader.</p><br/><p>Tonight, they will crush that goblin village, and so take the first step into the Jura forest.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, hunt the nearby monsters, as to prove themselves as the forest\u2019s rulers.</p><br/><p>And someday soon, continue southward in search of greater power.</p><br/><p>We have the power to accomplish this, they thought.</p><br/><p>Our claws rip through the flesh of any beast, and our fangs piece any armor.</p><br/><p>*Uoooooooooooon!!!*</p><br/><p>The pack leader howled!</p><br/><p>The time to trample their foes had come.</p><br/><p>However, there was one thing that bothered him.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, a brother he had sent on reconnaissance had brought back bewildering information.</p><br/><p>A small monster releasing monstrous energy.</p><br/><p>That monster\u2019s demonic aura far surpassed that of the leader.</p><br/><p>There could be no such thing. So concluded the leader.</p><br/><p>He had not perceived such a threat, and all the monsters he met were weak.</p><br/><p>There had been nothing to call resistance as of yet.</p><br/><p>Only that one time, ten or so goblins had murdered a few of their brethren, but never again.</p><br/><p>Chances are, the scout was far too excited to see rationally.</p><br/><p>Thinking that, the boss only looked ahead.</p><br/><p>And in front of him, lay the village.</p><br/><p>It was just were the scouts reported.</p><br/><p>Using the wounded goblin, they had marked this village. So now, they can hardly offer proper resistance.</p><br/><p>The leader was a cunning wolf. He wouldn\u2019t let his guard down.</p><br/><p>However, the village was not as expected.</p><br/><p>As if it belonged to humans\u2026 it was fenced.</p><br/><p>They had dismantled every house and erected a wall.</p><br/><p>And, in the middle of the entrance ahead, stood a single slime.</p><br/><p>How ingenious!</p><br/><p>So laughed the leader.</p><br/><p>They left an opening to defend against our numbers! Were his thoughts.</p><br/><p>After all, they were slow-witted, trash of a monster.</p><br/><p>That wall will quickly topple before our claw and fang!</p><br/><p>We shall show them our might! With these thoughts, he ordered the attack.</p><br/><p>And as one, ten fang wolves assaulted the walls.</p><br/><p>They truly were a single being.</p><br/><p>That was their true worth\u2013their unity in combat.</p><br/><p>Movement made possible through telepathic communication. A form of communication many times faster than words.</p><br/><p>The first attack should have destroyed the walls.</p><br/><p>Surely, the leader imagined, the goblins will soon realize the futility of their plan and panic. Instead, it was the leader who let out a voice of surprise.</p><br/><p>The attack squad was repelled! And, there was something rolling on the ground while splashing blood among them, too.</p><br/><p>What had happened?</p><br/><p>Without a hint of panic, he sought answers.</p><br/><p>The slime had not moved.</p><br/><p>Did he do something?</p><br/><p>And then, the closest of his subordinates,</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s the one from that day! The one that possessed an aura stronger than our lord!)</p><br/><p>So he reported.</p><br/><p>How foolish! He thought while looking at the slime.</p><br/><p>They would sometimes be born in the plains.</p><br/><p>You\u2019d exaggerate if you called them monsters; a pitiful existence.</p><br/><p>To be surpass myself in demonic aura\u2026 impossible!</p><br/><p>But then,</p><br/><p>\u300cAlriiight! Stop right there. If you withdraw now, I will not pursue. Depart at once!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what the slime declared.</p><br/><p>The Fang Wolves\u2019 leader was a crafty and cunning monster.</p><br/><p>Having lived many years and experienced many things, he\u2019d never neglect making a plan.</p><br/><p>He was cool-headed and possessed courage tested through many battles.</p><br/><p>His many experiences, and the information he collected, all rejected the presence of a being stronger than him among the goblins.</p><br/><p>But the leader had, at that one moment, made a fatal mistake.</p><br/><p>And that mistake has decided their fate.</p><br/><p>*Uuuru!! Garuuuuuuuu!!!*</p><br/><p>(Miserable existence!!! I\u2019ll pulverize you!!!)</p><br/><p>He ordered the attack.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Wow, that was a surprise.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t think they\u2019d attack so suddenly.</p><br/><p>I thought we\u2019d start with a conversation\u2026 now all my lines went to waste.</p><br/><p>All the practice gone to waste!</p><br/><p>I even practiced during break\u2026.</p><br/><p>The first order I gave was to be guided to the wounded.</p><br/><p>Well, even if I add ten or so more to the sixty, the odds won\u2019t change all that much.</p><br/><p>However, being idolized and all kind of makes me want to do all I can.</p><br/><p>They were placed in a rather large but filthy-looking building.</p><br/><p>So about the wounded.</p><br/><p>They seemed to have received some first-aid, but will surely die as things stand.</p><br/><p>What deep wounds. Ripped open by claw and fang, and their wounds had festered.</p><br/><p>Have to go all out here.</p><br/><p>And so, I absorbed the closest one. And, having dressed the wounds, spit him out.</p><br/><p>The village chief seemed to have been trying to say something \u2013 stuttering, actually \u2013 for a while, but I ignored him. And, going through every patient, I repeated the process.</p><br/><p>After many patients, I finally looked back at my handiwork.</p><br/><p>For some reason, the goblins were all prostrating themselves before me.</p><br/><p>What the hell are they doing?</p><br/><p>In any case, it seems they thought I had healed them with some inherent restorative power.</p><br/><p>Since that reaction was unpleasant, for the remaining wounded I spit the medicine out and treated them right there.</p><br/><p>And so, some time was spent on healing.</p><br/><p>Having finished medical treatment, I relayed next orders.</p><br/><p>The next thing to do would be to build a wall.</p><br/><p>Cutting down trees to build it would also be good, but we may not have enough time.</p><br/><p>Have to do with what we have.</p><br/><p>So without a hint of hesitation, we destroyed houses and recycled them into walls.</p><br/><p>One that would circle around the entire village.</p><br/><p>And while we were building, I sent out the brightest goblins, armed with bows, to scout.</p><br/><p>The enemy are wolves, so they have an excellent sense of smell, so I made sure to tell the scouts to avoid reckless action.</p><br/><p>Their resolve is impressive\u2026 \u201cEven at the cost of my life!\u201d that\u2019s the kind of aura they emit.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t they love to exaggerate.</p><br/><p>The wall was finished on the evening the day after I arrived.</p><br/><p>I put on some finishing touches.</p><br/><p>Right, I increased its durability with my spider\u2019s thread.</p><br/><p>And by the way, I didn\u2019t forget to place a trap using [Steel Thread], either.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t it be great if they blindly attack the walls? They\u2019d be cut to pieces.</p><br/><p>After this fight, definitely can\u2019t forget to go around collecting\u2026 \u201ccomponents\u201d.</p><br/><p>And at the front, we left an opening.</p><br/><p>Here, I\u2019ll place some [Sticky Thread] and that will be it for preparations.</p><br/><p>Now, all I can do is wait for the scouts.</p><br/><p>About that time, the goblins I treated started waking up.</p><br/><p>Having them touch my body, I confirmed their condition.</p><br/><p>Seems like the restorative pills are pretty serious stuff.</p><br/><p>I thought they\u2019d need to be treated many times, but\u2026</p><br/><p>It seems to have been super effective. What a pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>Then, we had gathered the remaining wood at the center of the village, and started a fire.</p><br/><p>Kind of like a campfire, except without the merry faces.</p><br/><p>We have to stay on guard the whole night.</p><br/><p>As I don\u2019t need sleep I naturally offered to stay on watch, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThere could be no such thing!!! We can hardly allow Rimuru-sama to further exert yourself.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs he said! We shall stay watch. Please rest, Rimuru-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! As they said!!! Came all the responses.</p><br/><p>And I appreciate the sentiment, it\u2019s just these guys are probably so much more tired than I am\u2026</p><br/><p>Nothing I can do, I guess. So we decided to keep a look-out on rotation.</p><br/><p>In the dead of the night, the scouts had come back.</p><br/><p>The wolves had begun to move\u2013so they reported.</p><br/><p>They had some wounds, but all returned alive.</p><br/><p>I used to think they were filthy and ugly monsters.</p><br/><p>But I grew sympathetic to them over these two days.</p><br/><p>In prayers, each and every one of them wished for these battles to end.</p><br/><p>Those were my thoughts as I set up the [Sticky Thread] and stood at the gate.</p><br/><p>The battle began with the fang wolves\u2019 attack.</p><br/><p>I was worried if the gate would hold, but the wolves cannot mount an attack that would penetrate them.</p><br/><p>Seems like the traps were effective as well.</p><br/><p>At least that went well.</p><br/><p>For now,</p><br/><p>\u300cAlriiight! Stop right there. If you withdraw now, I will not pursue. Depart at once!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what I called out.</p><br/><p>And I was completely ignored.</p><br/><p>The wolves moved at once, and begun assaulting the gate from all direction.</p><br/><p>Well, it can\u2019t be helped. Hopefully things will proceed according to plan.</p><br/><p>Having predicted this outcome, I left small openings in the fence.</p><br/><p>An arrow-slit.</p><br/><p>Even the clumsy goblins are capable of shooting through that hole.</p><br/><p>Many wolves were hit by arrows, and fell whimpering.</p><br/><p>There were also wolves that try to dig through those openings, but\u2026</p><br/><p>*Zasu!*</p><br/><p>Every time, they\u2019d be hit from both sides by stone axes and perish.</p><br/><p>Though the goblins hadn\u2019t even practiced for two hours, they were desperate.</p><br/><p>Desperate to understand my directions and put them to use.</p><br/><p>And the result is the current situation.</p><br/><p>Without a question, the fang wolves are strong. As single beast, they are capable of taking on many goblins at once.</p><br/><p>As a pack, they might be truly formidable.</p><br/><p>But, that\u2019s the key. Just hit them a few times, one at time. Divide and conquer.</p><br/><p>In short, brains will always triumph over brawn.</p><br/><p>The strongest animals in the world are those blessed with supreme intelligence\u2013humans!</p><br/><p>\u2026 how unlucky\u2026 while thinking these things, I felt the cold stare of the pack leader.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s but an animal, and thinks he can defeat me\u2026 how conceited!</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>The pack leader was bewildered by this sudden turn of events.</p><br/><p>His subordinates are beginning to panic.</p><br/><p>This could be bad.</p><br/><p>Fang wolves are as strong as they are united.</p><br/><p>Leader\u2019s distrust of his subordinates has always led to a single, devastating result.</p><br/><p>He had understood that much. And so, this was where he had committed the gravest mistake.</p><br/><p>He was angry that the wall wouldn\u2019t come down; but, he was also afraid that his comrades\u2019 anger was directed at him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe leader needs to show his power!\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s the strongest one in the pack, he should be able to do this himself!\u201d They may think.</p><br/><p>And at that moment, it was settled.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>No one took their eyes off the leader\u2019s movement.</p><br/><p>However, to the goblins, it appeared as if he had disappeared.</p><br/><p>For me, he moved as if in slow motion.</p><br/><p>It all went according to plan.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve thought up quiet a few scenarios, and the battle had played out according to one of those.</p><br/><p>As you\u2019d expect from beasts. They\u2019d never triumph over a human.</p><br/><p>The leader was caught in the [Sticky Thread] I lay at the entrance.</p><br/><p>With his strength, perhaps he could cut through it.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have a way to verify that point\u2026 not that it even matters.</p><br/><p>The goal of the [Sticky Thread] was to hold the leader down if for but a moment.</p><br/><p>Without a pause in movement the \u201cwater blade\u201d may miss, and it\u2019d look uncool.</p><br/><p>To say nothing of the worst case scenario: hitting a friendly during combat. Well, those kinds of accidents do happen on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>I did have a trap prepared to avoid that, but seems like setting it up was a waste of effort.</p><br/><p>This guy never came up with a better plan than destroying the walls.</p><br/><p>I did consider laying some [Steel Thread] traps at the entrance as well, but considering all the situations where they\u2019d avoid them, I decided against it.</p><br/><p>Right now, I have to play the part of an overwhelmingly powerful monster.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s for that reason, that I set the traps.</p><br/><p>And without any hesitation, I decapitated the leader wolf.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how easily he died.</p><br/><p>\u300cHear me, Fang Wolves! Your leader has been felled by me!!! I give you a choice. Servitude or death?\u300d</p><br/><p>So, how will they respond?</p><br/><p>Having just arranged the leader\u2019s funeral, I\u2019d rather not extend that list to a bunch of mad wolves looking for a place to die\u2026</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: the Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Titles: None</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Skills: Unique Skill [Great Sage], Unique Skill [Predator], Slime-Specific Skills [Dissolve, Absorb, Regenerate], Extra Skill [Water Manipulation], Extra Skill [Magic Perception], Acquired Skills: Black Serpent [Heat Detection, Noxious Breath], Centipede [Paralysis Breath], Spider [Sticky Thread, Steel Threat], Bat [Ultrasound Waves], Lizard [Body Armor]</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance EX, Physical Attack Resistance, Pain Resistance, Electricity Resistance, Paralysis Resistance</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You\u2019ve done well.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m saying this, so believe me won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>To begin with, I had not expected it, but Adalman had beaten Shinji\u2019s team. (TN: When they came as spies.)</p><br/><p>He had obviously developed far more than I had anticipated.</p><br/><p>His fight up with Krishna, one of the Emperor\u2019s Personal Guard, was just a bad match up.</p><br/><p>So I had already pardoned him, and was going to start the Ascension Ritual but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven still Rimuru-sama, I cannot forgive myself.</p><br/><p>For me to ascend to the Demon Lordship same as your highness\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I would gladly take the opportunity to become one, when I have earned it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He resisted my offer thus.</p><br/><p>It was true that the Labyrinth was our last line of defence, and its defensive strength it was important.</p><br/><p>At this point, rather than trying to protect the current capital city of Tempest, it was optimal to transfer all the important facilities into deep inside the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>The capital itself would then work as a place to host international dignitaries, becoming in effect, a vacation town.</p><br/><p>On that note, the Labyrinth also had its Ten Lords.</p><br/><p>And there was no problem with leaving its defence to Demon Lord-class individuals like Zegion or Kumara.</p><br/><p>The Labyrinth I had built as a playground had turned into a fortress all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>I wanted Adalman to attain Demon Lordship, but I shouldn\u2019t ignore his personal wishes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.</p><br/><p>But I will hold great expectations of you.</p><br/><p>When there is another chance, be sure to prove the worth of those expectations!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Your highness will surely observe my worth with your own eyes!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I shall remember those words of yours.</p><br/><p>So leaving aside your ascension to Demon Lord\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>From today onwards, I bestow you with the title \u2018Gehenna Lord\u2019.</p><br/><p>You shall work hard so as to live up to that name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you desire your highness!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu~. (TN: *breathes out*)</p><br/><p>Speaking with all this dignity really tires you out.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Adalman was now also considered among my strongest subordinates, having received a \u2018-Lord\u2019 title.</p><br/><p>From now on, his authority would increase. That is, if he was willing exercise that privilege.</p><br/><p>(TN: Warning, character switching like crazy.)</p><br/><p>Well then, Adalman wasn\u2019t the only one who had been defeated.</p><br/><p>Albert needed to get his get his broken equipment replaced.</p><br/><p>He was able to use average weapons and armour with the skills of a master.</p><br/><p>Were the Legendary-tier items taken from the Empire more suited to him?</p><br/><p>-Was my train of thought.</p><br/><p>Who would get to use the only God-tier set?</p><br/><p>There was a reason why I didn\u2019t give it to Gerudo.</p><br/><p>His skills would be suited to Legendary-tier and advancing to God-tier would be a matter of time.</p><br/><p>Skill wasn\u2019t the only reason, but Gerudo probably wouldn\u2019t be able to use the God-tier set to its full potential.</p><br/><p>At a glance, Calgurio was not a weak man.</p><br/><p>In fact, he even had Skills and was a decent fighter.</p><br/><p>Even so, he never could bring out the potential of his God-tier set, and only used it as a high defense armour.</p><br/><p>A God-tier armour chose its master.</p><br/><p>I knew this sort of secret info after much analysis. (TN: via Raphael-sensei I guess.)</p><br/><p>Demonic Steel maturing over many years transforms into God Steel, becoming a \u2018Tsukumogami\u2019 (TN: a living tool, so to say. ), and attains God-tier power.</p><br/><p>Equipment crafted from such metals would be extremely underpowered in the hands of the unskilled.</p><br/><p>For a short-lived human, gaining a mastery required for such treasures would be but a distant dream.</p><br/><p>But even becoming a ghost with an unlimited lifespan, he was a soul who had not lost his talents as a Holy Knight.</p><br/><p>Possibly being even better than Hakurou at swordsmanship, was Albert really not worthy of such equipment?</p><br/><p>After all, most of the candidates to evolve into Demon Lordship had no need of new armours as they could make them on their own.</p><br/><p>For example, Demons like Diablo could make their own clothes through a type of materialization power.</p><br/><p>It was a very strong, perhaps even Legendary-tier attire.</p><br/><p>But those clothes were only meant to be insurance.</p><br/><p>It was a backup if the force field they put up was to be broken.</p><br/><p>Honestly, I considered granting the armour to Benimaru or Souei, but that decision might be better considered after they were evolved.</p><br/><p>In the first place, \u2018Nullify Physical Attacks\u2019 would cause most armours to be useless.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, with time, it may be possible to improve Legendary-tier to God-tier, so it was alright not to worry about their gear right now.</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s \u014cdachi, the \u2018Improved \u2022 Hercules\u2019 Edge\u2019, had somehow even turned into a weapon of Legendary-tier destructive power.</p><br/><p>Kurobee\u2019s armours could be good candidates for evolution.</p><br/><p>And there was also a matter of compatibility with the armour.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Wisdom Lord Raphael-san had already determined Albert to be worthy.</p><br/><p>In that case, Albert\u2019s reward would be the God-tier armour confiscated from Calgurio.</p><br/><p>It was a Full-plate Armour that came with a Long Sword and Kite Shield in a set.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlbert, your sword skills are truly masterful.</p><br/><p>Continue helping Adalman with those unwavering hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking thus, I handed Albert his reward.</p><br/><p>Having to receive it directly from my hands left him shaking with tension. (TN: lolicon)</p><br/><p>He worried way too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-this is!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Recognizing the power of what he now held, Albert let out a voice of astonishment.</p><br/><p>It was understandable.</p><br/><p>These items were legacies from the age of gods, even their existence was debated.</p><br/><p>For a knight, having permission to use them was the greatest honor.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you make use of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t let him refuse.</p><br/><p>Grasping the strength of my intensions,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir! I will make the best use of it, to repay you for this honor!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Albert replied loudly.</p><br/><p>In this way, I safely handed over the set to Albert, and he was easily recognized as the armour\u2019s master.</p><br/><p>But I had made one miscalculation.</p><br/><p>The true power of the fully released God-tier armour was beyond my imagination.</p><br/><p>Hey no one told me this! The analysis didn\u2019t show this!!</p><br/><p>Wisdom Lord Raphael, hmm? I finally understood the reason for my overreaction.</p><br/><p>She knew didn\u2019t she. (TN: I call Raphael-san a she because of certain spoilers.) That was why she advocated for Albert and not Benimaru.</p><br/><p>\u2018Turn a body of flesh into that of a Spirit Form for a certain amount of time\u2019</p><br/><p>That was the hidden power of God-tier armour.</p><br/><p>A Spirit Form, in other words, a God-like Being.</p><br/><p>Veldora was like that, and speaking of which, I was too.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t pay much attention, but it was certainly a state close to being immortal.</p><br/><p>Eternal youth was guaranteed, along with a strong degree of immortality.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t die unless there was a Core Break or Energy Roast successfully performed on me.</p><br/><p>Although temporary, to be able to grant an existence of that scale, this armour was fearsome.</p><br/><p>But for this reason, it was not suited to half-Spirit Forms like Benimaru, and even less for true Spirit Forms like Demons.</p><br/><p>The armour had gone to where it belonged.</p><br/><p>Now, that was all of the Ten Lords done with, but we shouldn\u2019t forget Adalman\u2019s pet dragon.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the Death Dragon also did well.</p><br/><p>I wonder what could be a good reward.</p><br/><p>I walked past the 4 Dragon Kings (TN: The bosses of floors 96+) and arrived at Death Dragon\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>Sensing my arrival, the Death Dragon bowed its head nervously.</p><br/><p>Its fearsome appearance aside, it was pretty cute to be honest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to give you something too. It is a \u2018name\u2019.</p><br/><p>From today you are the \u2018Gehennic Dragon King\u2019 Wenti!\u201d</p><br/><p>I named it thus in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>And a dramatic transformation resulted.</p><br/><p>The 20m long beast shrunk in front of our eyes and transformed into a beauty garbed in black. (TN: ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0))</p><br/><p>This time I wasn\u2019t so surprised.</p><br/><p>With monsters, anything was possible. Having experienced this so many times, I wouldn\u2019t get worked up so easily.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have any complaints this time, its only natural! This was my character now.</p><br/><p>I am pretty cool, if I do say so myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, benevolent and cherished God!</p><br/><p>To give my lowly self such a blessing, I am ecstatic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, yeah.</p><br/><p>By blessing she means name.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh, good for you, Death \u2015\u2015 I mean, Wenti!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, master, God had not forgotten me \u2015\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, this is also for our growth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a nice master-pet love. (TN: ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0))</p><br/><p>Yeah, good for them. I feel a bit like a third wheel.</p><br/><p>Well, they seem happy, so it\u2019s all good.</p><br/><p>Actually, my power didn\u2019t drain with this naming.</p><br/><p>I had used 5000 souls for the process.</p><br/><p>Wisdom Lord Raphael-san\u2019s analyses has determined this to be possible, and conversion to Energy was possible with Gluttony King Beelzebub.</p><br/><p>Clearly, there was a risk considering the amount of Energy possibly necessary to name an elite monster of Dragon-class.</p><br/><p>I had named the Demon Dukes before using the Energy that Beelzebub had slowly accumulated.</p><br/><p>It would be a problem if I went to Sleep Mode, from using up my internal stock.</p><br/><p>The total amount of Energy had increased, and it was impossible to know how long it would take to recover if used up.</p><br/><p>It was not ok to do get drained like that especially now that we were at war.</p><br/><p>I had finally realized why the other Demon Lords didn\u2019t go around naming their Devil class subordinates.</p><br/><p>At the very least, it was imperative to stop naming things during a war period.</p><br/><p>This time, using souls as an alternative, my burden was nil.</p><br/><p>Much thanks to Wisdom Lord Raphael.</p><br/><p>There were no problems since 9 of them had already ascended to Demon Lordship.</p><br/><p>Getting a human form would be surprising, but a dragon changing to human was a well known clich\u00e9.</p><br/><p>It was not surprising at all.</p><br/><p>Anyway, with that, the commendations and rewards for the Labyrinth group had ended.</p><br/><p>On a side note, the 4 Dragon Kings were under Ramiris\u2019 command.</p><br/><p>So they were excluded from my list, but actually, I had something for them too.</p><br/><p>There was a total of 940,000 souls collected, and to revive 700,000 of the Imperial troops, around 10,000 were used.</p><br/><p>Well, some of them seemed to require a very high amount of Spirit Energy so, the total cost was a bit higher than expected.</p><br/><p>And then I tried to divide up the 930,000 remaining souls between me and Ramiris but,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t have any way to use souls so no thanks, \u2018kay?\u201d</p><br/><p>She told me.</p><br/><p>So then, I resurrected Michelle and Raymond as her assistants.</p><br/><p>It was not a partial revival, but a full-blown resurrection.</p><br/><p>With their Nucleic Hearts intact, complete soul revival was possible, and they were still able to use their Skills.</p><br/><p>I felt that that wasn\u2019t enough to thank Ramiris, so I granted names to the 4 Dragon Kings in a similar way to Wenti.</p><br/><p>After all, they were worked to the bone in recent events and even died a few times, rewarding them was a matter of course.</p><br/><p>Dragons who were said to be potentially stronger than Arch Demons, but their natural evolution had limits.</p><br/><p>With that in mind, I provided each with 5000 souls and had Ramiris name them.</p><br/><p>I was again using souls as an alternate to Energy.</p><br/><p>The results were splendid and the Dragon Kings had now become true \u2018Dragon Kings\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fire Hell Dragon King\u2019 Zephyrus.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ice Hell Dragon King\u2019 Boreas.</p><br/><p>\u2018Lightning Dragon King\u2019 Notos.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tremor Dragon King\u2019 Euros</p><br/><p>(TN: Anemoi)</p><br/><p>They were named according to the floors they governed.</p><br/><p>I thought up the names, but had Ramiris do the actual naming.</p><br/><p>They all attained beautiful humanoid forms.</p><br/><p>Their evolution was a success, and they had gained a huge boost in Energy along with their human forms.</p><br/><p>To be precise, it was only a humanoid form, and they hadn\u2019t become Dragonoids like Milim.</p><br/><p>Dragoniods were actually Spirit Forms who dwelled in flesh, so they were an Irregular existence.</p><br/><p>Even if they were powerful Dragon Lords, as they were held in flesh, their power was lower than the \u2018Dragons\u2019, a true Spirit Form species.</p><br/><p>The souls used for naming on this occasion was undeniably less than the amount needed to ascend to Demon Lordship.</p><br/><p>But, their strength was said to be equivalent.</p><br/><p>Demon Lords and Dragon Kings were inherently different, and more importantly, monsters weren\u2019t bound by many forms of logic.</p><br/><p>If you think too hard, you lose.</p><br/><p>And so, the process of evolving the Dragon Kings to give thanks to Ramiris went along smoothly.</p><br/><p>By the way, the Ten Lords of the Labyrinth were fairly equal in Energy, but there were large differences in actual fighting power.</p><br/><p>So, the 4 Dragon Kings also had equal stores of Energy, but were weaker in fighting prowess.</p><br/><p>This was mainly due to overall fighting experience; their levels were just lower.</p><br/><p>They seemed to be fairly frustrated with being defeated multiple times recently, so the Dragons had decided to undergo training.</p><br/><p>They had attained humanoid forms, and were also interested in combat styles in their new bodies.</p><br/><p>Without relying solely on Elemental attacks or physical attacks using their fangs and talons, they would learn and incorporated Magic.</p><br/><p>And by learning to fight as humanoids, they would later prove their might in battle.</p><br/><p>This would work so well, that their new found strength would grow tremendously, but that was something I\u2019d get to see a lot later.</p><br/><p>Now then, the only ones left are the triad of Demon Dukes.</p><br/><p>what I should do, was the question.</p><br/><p>Of the 930,000 souls, I had used up a majority on ascending some to Demon Lordship, and on naming some, and in the end the amount remaining was 210,000.</p><br/><p>I could ascend 2 more but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Was it alright to evolve Carrera as Gerudo suggested?</p><br/><p>If I did, then there was still Testa and Ul. Which one of them should I choose?</p><br/><p>These 3 were almost equal to Diablo in strength in the first place.</p><br/><p>In my view, Diablo was a step ahead, but originally their powers were equivalent.</p><br/><p>Diablo had to first beat them, and then scout them as my subordinates, so he had to be stronger.</p><br/><p>Therefore, wouldn\u2019t there be a problem in creating a power misbalance among them?</p><br/><p>Frankly, it was dangerous.</p><br/><p>If they were not all treated equally, there would definitely be hurt feelings.</p><br/><p>If it was just Carrera, I don\u2019t think there would be any complaints, but making the strongest one of them even stronger seemed wrong.</p><br/><p>Sort of like, uncontrollable power would lead to her own demise.</p><br/><p>After all, if she hadn\u2019t stopped her \u2015\u2015 Gravity Collapse \u2015\u2015 in the nick of time, the resulting mini-supernova tier blast would have decimated Gerudo\u2019s troops along with all of the capital.</p><br/><p>She was probably aware that she could stop it, but that choice of magic in that situation and place seemed like a red flag.</p><br/><p>I decided to observe whether the ones who had already evolved could control their power before thinking of granting ascension to those girls.</p><br/><p>On that note, as if reading my mind, Diablo would always take appropriate measures.</p><br/><p>He was able to bring his new power fully under control, and was an all around dependable guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cTestarossa, Ultima, Carrera.</p><br/><p>You 3 have worked well as Intelligence gatherers in the recent battles.</p><br/><p>However, your ascension shall be granted at a more appropriate time.</p><br/><p>I have considered Gerudo\u2019s thoughts on evolving Carrera, but I believe that doing so now would be a premature action.</p><br/><p>You may be dissatisfied, but please understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRimuru-sama, please do not lower you head! We have not the slightest reason to be dissatisfied!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d (TN: -desuwa)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a non-issue. We are already very strong as it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three denied any and all possibility of dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>They were indeed correct in saying that they possessed much strength.</p><br/><p>And they were probably stronger than the evolved Gabil even at present.</p><br/><p>There was no need to rush their development, or create needless bitterness.</p><br/><p>Its probably better to handle these 3 together.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am glad to hear that.</p><br/><p>I feel like we truly understand each other.</p><br/><p>But I cannot let you go without any reward\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I will have you 3 be part of my executives.</p><br/><p>\u2018Killer Lord\u2019 Testarossa. (TN: Kira(Killer) like in Death Note.)</p><br/><p>\u2018Pain Lord\u2019 Ultima.</p><br/><p>\u2018Menace Lord\u2019 Carrera.</p><br/><p>On this day, I bestow you with these titles.</p><br/><p>You are still new to the country of Tempest, but I will entrust its future to you as my loyal confidants!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you desire, my liege!!\u201d</p><br/><p>They lowered their heads in unison.</p><br/><p>They seemed to like their titles.</p><br/><p>With that, I now had 12 \u2018-Lords\u2019 under my wing.</p><br/><p>They had been called \u2018The Four Heavenly Kings\u2019 or \u2018The Ten Lords of the Labyrinth\u2019, but my 12 lords would be known as \u2018Rimuru\u2019s Twelve Patrons\u2019.</p><br/><p>Well, I\u2019m not too finicky about the name, but it should give off a \u2018strongest team\u2019 feel.</p><br/><p>At this point, Gobuta, being one of them became increasingly bizarre.</p><br/><p>My power to reward people was actually quite fun.</p><br/><p>As I gazed at the Patrons lined up in front of me, I bemused such thoughts.</p><br/><p>With this, the Rewards and Evolution Ceremony had finally come to an end.</p><br/><p>Perhaps influenced by today\u2019s events, I would later be known as \u2018Chaos Creator\u2019 Rimuru.</p><br/><p>(TN: Author\u2019s words)</p><br/><p>This part felt very prolonged, but I plan to progress the story from the next chapter.</p><br/><p>Character introductions take some time and I don\u2019t think it was done very well.</p><br/><p>If there is a chance, I will use it, so please be understanding.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Rant:</p><br/><p>This was another rather long chapter. It feels like the prologue to this arc has ended. Lot\u2019s happened. There were a lot of readers who wanted to help out with translations too. The good, the bad and the ugly\u2026 that kind of feeling. Well, I have in fact teamed up with Smoggy so theoretically, translations should be faster. But there is no need to raise false hopes. Since things like school are big deterrers to a time consuming work like translation. I try to maintain the progress bars on this page. People like progress bars it seems. As for chapter 165, right now I have no idea. Be on the lookout for the progress bar updates! Well then, I shant talk too long. See you in another chapter ~gao!</p><br/><p>Corrections: I\u2019ve made a few corrections as Alfha-san suggested in the comments, but not all of them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

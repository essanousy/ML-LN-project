It can be said that this is the main reason.</p><br/><p>However, children should go outside and play around, not spending their time locked up in an Academy.</p><br/><p>Hearing about this from the children, Shizu-san tried to bring them outside but it was rejected.</p><br/><p>Somehow, It seems they are trying too much in trying to confine the children, am I underestimating the church way too much?</p><br/><p>Anyway, I\u2019m doing what I believe is the right thing to do.</p><br/><p>And thus, I\u2019m taking the children outside.</p><br/><p>First of all, I made the children memorize .</p><br/><p>Normally, it\u2019s impossible even in one year to understand it. It\u2019s necessary to understand both of the structure of the magic formation and to have the knowledge of the meaning on the system\u2019s crest.</p><br/><p>This magic is far more advanced than , it really is cruel to make children that haven\u2019t even hit 10 year old to learn it.</p><br/><p>But, they might not be able to do it even if they took 3 years; perhaps there is no need to have them memorize the theory and such.</p><br/><p>Although it\u2019s unfair, on such occasion, it\u2019s time for the skill to shine.</p><br/><p>With my\u300eShapeshifter\u300fabilities, I can embedded my knowledge and fused it into the children.</p><br/><p>Actually I think it\u2019s unfair, but there\u2019s no need to be picky about one\u2019s appearances anymore.</p><br/><p>Next, I summons Ranga\u2019s subordinate, with their transforming ability, I make them take the form of the children.</p><br/><p>I also made myself a clone and then the preparation is completed.</p><br/><p>Even if I had thought that there might be problem to those who opposed with them going outside, I still chose to do it.</p><br/><p>I had discussed it with Yuuki for several times, but he think it\u2019s too dangerous and our opinion clashed.</p><br/><p>It would be great if I had succeed in persuading him, but sadly it\u2019s all in vain. I can persuade him slowly if there is time, but putting me aside, the children don't have much time left.</p><br/><p>\u300eGreat Sage\u300fhad predict that at the earliest, the children had a time limit of 3 months.</p><br/><p>There is no time for a leisure discussion.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m forcing myself to learn to bring the children outside.</p><br/><p>Why learn ?</p><br/><p>The reason is simple. There is no need to search for the lodging while we travel, so the church won\u2019t be alerted by it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, until we reach our destination, there is no need to enter Ulgrasia Republic personally and we can go straight to Ulg Nature Park.</p><br/><p>Me and Ranga will take the children, and then we will travel rapidly.</p><br/><p>Before School lunchtime arrives, using the installed Magic Formation for we will have already returned to the classroom.</p><br/><p>After eating the lunch, we\u2019ll then use the and resume our travel from where we left.</p><br/><p>The purpose for making the children use magic is to have them use their magic power.</p><br/><p>If a Grand Magic is used we can postpone their breakdown for a while. The children agreed without complaining.</p><br/><p>How should I say it? Their first trip cause them great excitements.</p><br/><p>They are scared at first, but after they accustomed to the high-speed movement of me and Ranga, they enjoyed it with a great smile.</p><br/><p>At the beginning, there was someone who\u2019s peed at my back. Who would think such thing can happen?</p><br/><p>Geez... To protect their honor, they deliberately didn\u2019t said a single word.</p><br/><p>While various small things happens, we finally arrived at the\u300eDwelling of the Spirit\u300fat last.</p><br/><p>Ulgrasia Republic is very different from the nations surrounding Jura Forest.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not under the influence of the Western Saint\u2019s Church, also, this small nation is not a member of the Council.</p><br/><p>They receive the Divine Protection of Spirit of Wisdom.</p><br/><p>This is the nation who conducts trade with Sorcery Dynasty of Sarion.</p><br/><p>While there is no restriction for going in and out of the nation, there are relatively few criminals in that nation.</p><br/><p>The reason is straightforward. This nation\u2019s people are all user.</p><br/><p> more or less can be divided into two main categories.</p><br/><p>The first is .</p><br/><p>This category has a lot offensive spell that is similar to .</p><br/><p>It\u2019s borrowing the power of the spirit when using it. It requires Magic power as compensation.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to chant in spells, everyone can use it if they are connected with the spiritsthey contracted with. However, to be recognizance by the spirits, it was necessary to be liked by them.</p><br/><p>In this nation, there are many person that is liked by the spirits that exist inside the nation.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they are holding the contract\u2019s ceremony when someone reaches the age of 10 years old, if there\u2019s a person who is unable to make contract with the spirits, that person will be driven out from the nation when reaching 20 years old.</p><br/><p>Losing their qualification as a citizen. However, because there\u2019re many kinds of spirits, a person that is unable to contract with the spirits are rare.</p><br/><p>The second is .</p><br/><p>In this category, it was necessary to be contracted with a powerful spirit. However, to do the summoning a chant is required, though it\u2019s easier than the other type of magic.</p><br/><p>To that extent, there are no need to compare the power. only borrowed a portion of the spirit\u2019s power, while with it\u2019s possible to use the power of the spirit itself. </p><br/><p>Besides its power, it surpassed it in all other area.</p><br/><p>Thus, the power of borrowing is no match for the real thing.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s very difficult for a user of to win against an opponent who uses.</p><br/><p>Even if the opponent has bad affinity against the other side, he would be able to turn over the disadvantage with .</p><br/><p>Sorcery Dynasty of Sarion, a nation where the representative chanting magic, is the mainstream magic, contrary with Ulgrasia Republic where the contract magic, that is is the mainstream magic.</p><br/><p>For these reasons, because there are a lot of exchange between them, and there is the background that works together in competition, and develops each other's.</p><br/><p>And so, we come to this place with an objective.</p><br/><p>That is of course, Spirit Summoning.</p><br/><p>I had raised a hypothesis.</p><br/><p>And that is, Regarding the situation of the Flame Giant (Ifrit) that Shizu-san fusion with, having its magic power rampage would somehow prevented causing body decay.</p><br/><p>Is it high rank spirit magic to control Ifrit, or is it because of the Unique Skill\u300eShapeshifter\u300fthat the Fusion was able to be done?</p><br/><p>In any case, the key is to use with a spirit.</p><br/><p>A sentient spirit are few in number, and it\u2019s called a high rank spirit.</p><br/><p>In this city, there are two places to contract a spirit.</p><br/><p>First is in a place where the citizens conduct their contract that is on an altar in the middle of the city. But this place has a rare chance of a High Rank Spirit to be summoned</p><br/><p>For the user of High Rank Spirit Magic, to conduct contract, it is necessary to go to the other place.</p><br/><p>That is, the\u300eDwelling of the Spirit\u300f.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a labyrinth that stretched in the underground or maybe in the air. The only door to enter is located in Ulg Nature Park.</p><br/><p>The door is embedded on a big rock, and beyond the door is a different dimension. </p><br/><p>But, our purpose is to contract a High Rank Spirit, so there is no other choice for us than to keep going.</p><br/><p>We take preparation to rest for one night.</p><br/><p>From beyond this door, it is doubtful if we can use to return. Although I had a hunch it won\u2019t be impossible.</p><br/><p>Anyway, the Magic Formation in the Park was installed in such way to not draw any attention. At the worst, if the inside is suspicious it is still possible to use it to escape, although I doubt whether it would be useful or not. Just for an insurance though. </p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>[Are the preparation finish? We might not return once we enter. Are your guys ready?]</p><br/><p>In response to my question.</p><br/><p>[Of course!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s all right!]</p><br/><p>And so on. Several answers come.</p><br/><p>There, there. There is no need to be afraid. Lately, they begun to put their trust into me, the feelings they harbor toward me is different compared from before.</p><br/><p>Transforming into a black wolf, I instant-kill any monsters that get on our way, that might be what gain their trust. </p><br/><p>Then, let resume the travel.</p><br/><p>Regarding that place, I obtained some information about it when I was searching for information in the library.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, although it accurately tell the location, it\u2019s not written what kind of monsters that are going to appear on the inside.</p><br/><p>It only said that there would be a trial, I don\u2019t know what kind of danger we\u2019ll face....</p><br/><p>Can Me and Ranga protect the children? There is a slight feeling of unease.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s not good, I might temporarily withdraw and call Benimaru and others.</p><br/><p>Anyway, we went inside and proceed carefully.</p><br/><p>The inside, even though the sunlight did not able to reach inside, it\u2019s still full with bright lights.</p><br/><p>Just in case, I turn off the \u300eMagic Perception\u300f, it seems the vision is alright. There\u2019s also no problem with the atmosphere. The children can enter without any problem.</p><br/><p>With all members inside, we proceed with caution.</p><br/><p>I assign Ranga as the bodyguard of the children.</p><br/><p>Rather than a labyrinth, it\u2019s a straight path....</p><br/><p>We advanced carefully.</p><br/><p>............</p><br/><p>........</p><br/><p>....</p><br/><p>I\u2019m thankful for the mind mapping,</p><br/><p>I can go on straight path, there are many traps installed here that can disturb someone\u2019s sense of direction.</p><br/><p>Looking behind, the road that was illuminated by the lamp-like mechanism is now hidden by the shadow.</p><br/><p>Looking at front, the path once hidden by light now become visible.</p><br/><p>I see. It really is a labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Using normal person sense of direction, perhaps it\u2019s possible to become lost.</p><br/><p>This is somehow become quite frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Well. Well. My. Oh My.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFound It Out. Out Find It.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Ah. Oh. Ah. Oh. Ah\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*chatter*chuckle*giggle*\u201d</p><br/><p>All of sudden I hear the Spirit voice in my mind.</p><br/><p>A really strong mind voice. No, maybe this is Mind communication (Telepathy)?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Foolish Visitors!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecome More In Dread!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecome More In Fear!\u201d</p><br/><p>What a selfish words.</p><br/><p>The children are restlessly looking at their surroundings.</p><br/><p>Chloe and Alice didn\u2019t release their hand from my clothes.</p><br/><p>However, even the timid Ryouta drew his sword as if to protect the girls.</p><br/><p>The 3 boys had been given swords a while ago.</p><br/><p>It was something that I copied, a sword made from pure demon steel with, it transformed into a shape that\u2019s suitable for them. </p><br/><p>It\u2019s fortunate that there are circumstances to warrant their need before, however...</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore in Fear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Not, It Boring!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fumu.</p><br/><p>We arrived at a certain room. To make noise as they please, however, it\u2019s annoying.</p><br/><p>[Hey. Are you the one living in this place? Well then, are you the Spirits perchance?</p><br/><p>We have a purpose for coming here. We had business with the High Rank Spirit.</p><br/><p>So if it possible can we ask guidance from you?]</p><br/><p>Just in case, I asked.</p><br/><p>Now, what kind of reaction they will show?</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufufufufufu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Is Interesting! More Interesting Than Surprise! More Interesting Than Fear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNice! Nice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI Tell You! However! However!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn front!\u201d</p><br/><p>A light extend at the end of passage.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just like an invitation. Well, there is nothing other than to accept.</p><br/><p>When we advance at the passage, there is a great hall.</p><br/><p>And the middle of it, there was a Giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s begin the trial!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The giant\u2019s eyes shone red.</p><br/><p>Suddenly I start wondering, why the eyes of suspicious monsters always shining red? Well, whatever.</p><br/><p>[Hey, can you hear me? If I defeat the Giant, will the trial end?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, it\u2019s easy.</p><br/><p>I let Ranga protect the children, only I\u2019m alone that went ahead. </p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Oh! Oh my?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoing it alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOverconfident is dangerous, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Are you guys worrying about me?

It\u2019s movement is as fast as a master swordsman.</p><br/><p>This is... This is a very dangerous enemy.</p><br/><p>Its speed and its weight. If it hits, it definitely will cause a more disastrous damage than a traffic accident.</p><br/><p>Geez, is this really a trial? Are they trying to kill me? No doubt it.</p><br/><p>[Hey, Hey!!! What is this thing?</p><br/><p>You guys, are not testing me!

What are those guys really want.</p><br/><p>Th, this is, are those guys\u2019 retards?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m really mad inside, but it\u2019s gone when I see how childish they are.</p><br/><p>No good! No good!</p><br/><p>In front of the children, I must act like a gentleman.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no good if I lose my reason and succumb to rage, that\u2019s my teaching position.</p><br/><p>Well, the cool me has never been recklessly angry, this is something I\u2019m aware of.</p><br/><p>Heeheefuu, heeheefuu.</p><br/><p>I steady my breath and took a stance with some leeway.</p><br/><p>Heck, even without getting serious, it\u2019s alright if I don\u2019t get hit!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s quite fast, but I\u2019m faster than that thing. I am a guy who can disappear as fast as the speed of sound.</p><br/><p>Well, maybe\u300eBlack Lightning\u300fwon\u2019t be effective against it. Because, it\u2019s made of metal. The electric current might travel to the ground and neutralized.</p><br/><p>With the magic I learnt, there was none that works. Water Blade and Fire Ball is useless.</p><br/><p>Also, slicing it with sword is out of question. Even if it possible to cut it, the sword might break and it\u2019s troublesome so I won\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>A lump of Magic Steel, I wish you can pardon me from doing such thing. The Magic Puppet (Golem) has the highest hardness yet agile, it means it had few weaknesses, so troublesome!</p><br/><p>Then, shall I burn it to ashes....?</p><br/><p>[Hey, I allow you guys to apologize, but you guys are not apologizing, so it\u2019s fine if I destroy it right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAha ha ha ha ha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting, it\u2019s so amusing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBluffing!

So it\u2019s alright.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t get angry by such impudent telepathy.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have any vein, so the vein that appears in my head is just part of my imaginations.</p><br/><p>Well, I get the permission now.</p><br/><p>Good bye!

However, to make the range specifically small, it was necessary to concentrate to control the enormous amount of magic power (Energy).</p><br/><p>With support of \u300eGreat Sage\u300f, it\u2019s now possible to reduces the size of the Black Flame Prison (Hell Flare).</p><br/><p>It\u2019s still not possible for Benimaru to use it like this, the attack completely enveloped the Magic Puppet (Golem) in its sphere shape (Dome) with diameter of 5 m.</p><br/><p>So loud! A thunderous sound sounded; the dome disappears while leaving nothing remaining on its traces.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, inside the dome, the flame prison burns everything to nothingness with its high temperatures that reach several hundred million degrees.</p><br/><p>Even with my Heat Attack Resistance, it\u2019s not possible for me to be unaffected by it. A person that can endure such attack might not exist.</p><br/><p>The downside of this attack was, if the opponent\u2019s not restricted, it\u2019s easy thing to avoid the attack.

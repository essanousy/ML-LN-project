Dino and Dagruel</p><br/><p>We left the forest on our way to the Demon Lords\u2019 Walpurgis Banquet guided by Ramiris.</p><br/><p>We were flying on Veldora\u2019s back, so even though the trip should have taken a while, it probably won\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Seeing the marshes below us testified to our current speed.</p><br/><p>That is, getting to the marshes would have normally taken us 2~3 days but now it took a mere hour.</p><br/><p>Veldora personally found assuming a giant form troublesome, but as we had Shion, Beretta, and Grucius who couldn\u2019t fly, I asked him to put up with it.</p><br/><p>On that note,</p><br/><p>\u300cRamiris, were you planning on walking all the way to the banquet room (?)?\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>No matter how I thought about it, I couldn\u2019t imagine her making it on time.</p><br/><p>In response,</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Oh, walking there was hardly a problem.</p><br/><p>If I did, I\u2019d always have someone pick me up on the way there!\u300d</p><br/><p>She gave an answer that I couldn\u2019t exactly wrap my head around.</p><br/><p>She\u2026 is always late so everyone has already gotten used to coming to pick her up.</p><br/><p>Chances are, that someone has a spatial travel type ability.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, then where are we headed right now?</p><br/><p>Overcome with a feeling of dread, I dared to ask,</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? There\u2019s no way I would know!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell! We\u2019re flying by your request and to your directions!\u201d I stopped myself from saying.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s just the way she is.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s no need to keep on flying then. So we decided to land and proceed while enjoying our surrounding.</p><br/><p>Thus we\u2019re calmly proceeding down the road.</p><br/><p>The moment you leave the Jura Forest you are already in Demon Lords\u2019 lands.</p><br/><p>Not that there\u2019s any grand difference in scenery, however.</p><br/><p>Compared to human cities and villages the magic energy density is higher, but not at levels at which humans couldn\u2019t survive.</p><br/><p>But, of course, the boulder on the side of the road wouldn\u2019t one day transform into Demon Steel Ore.</p><br/><p>Are there also few monsters naturally appearing here?</p><br/><p>I decided to ask,</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, even if we call it Demon Lord\u2019s dominion, unless we are talking about their residence or perhaps their province, normal people can also live here.</p><br/><p>As long as they pay the demon lord the appropriate tax, their safety is guaranteed\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s how it is. As expected of the all knowing master!\u201d Ramiris added.</p><br/><p>Why don\u2019t you know! I wanted to retort, but gave up.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, there are also demon lords with unknown demesne.</p><br/><p>Among the ones I have fought, there\u2019s the Giant, the Vampire, and the Demon.</p><br/><p>Of them, I only fought the Giant Dagrule and the Vampire Ruminas.</p><br/><p>And although it was only a single battle with Dagrule, it was fun..</p><br/><p>As for Ruminas, I turned the Vampire Country into ash, so when she came at me for real, I decided to withdraw!</p><br/><p>She just doesn\u2019t understand jokes. Where her domain is, I do not know.</p><br/><p>The other one was the king of demons.</p><br/><p>I had fought with his entourage of demons, but never with the king himself.</p><br/><p>His castle is located on the continent of ice, and it\u2019s damn cold. No humans live there.</p><br/><p>Going there would be boring, so I hadn\u2019t gone. Moreover\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>At that point, Veldora\u2019s words became rather unclear, and</p><br/><p>\u300cAnyways, there\u2019s no need to go to the middle of nowhere! Kuahahaha!\u300d</p><br/><p>He laughed trying to hide something.</p><br/><p>But, well, seems like this geezer has already angered a few demon lords.</p><br/><p>If my country was turned into ash, even I\u2019d get mad.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the Giant demon lord who once fought Veldora also seems dangerous.</p><br/><p>As for the ice continent, unless I\u2019m going to have some business there, I see no reason to go. So no need to think about that.</p><br/><p>However, demon lords seem actually pretty powerful. Comparing them by using the brat Ramiris as a base was certainly a mistake.</p><br/><p>I probably should have based them on Milim instead.</p><br/><p>Even after evolving, whether I can win against Milim or not is uncertain.</p><br/><p>No matter how many times we battled, since she never went all out, I don\u2019t have enough data.</p><br/><p>If compared to when we fought, I could win; but, as I do not know just how much she was holding back, I shouldn\u2019t be getting haughty.</p><br/><p>And, I can\u2019t believe Milim would support a subjugation order for me.</p><br/><p>Though it\u2019s clear that we are dancing to someone\u2019s tune here, I can\u2019t help but think that Milim is being manipulated\u2013whether she was awake or asleep\u2026</p><br/><p>I can, however, imagine that she has some reason for all of this.</p><br/><p>Not that thinking about it now will lead anywhere.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s decide this after we meet.</p><br/><p>And so, while listening to Veldora\u2019s tales, we continued leisurely down the road.</p><br/><p>If Ramiris is correct, we\u2019ll be shown the way by one of the demon lords soon.</p><br/><p>So while we were enjoying the breeze, we chanced upon two men approaching us.</p><br/><p>They are coming straight over here.</p><br/><p>A tall (huge!) chestnut haired man, and a slovenly green haired delicate man.</p><br/><p>Did they come to meet us? I thought and looked at them,</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! Ramiris, how have you been?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOooooh! Isn\u2019t that Veldora! You doing good?</p><br/><p>What a weak aura you\u2019re giving off.</p><br/><p>I had just convinced myself that I was feeling someone with a similar aura\u300d</p><br/><p>The conversation begun thus.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Dino, huh. Well done coming to get me!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Dagruel! We were just discussing our last battle\u300d</p><br/><p>Whether they came to meet us is yet unknown, but that they know each other is certain.</p><br/><p>So we went straight to introductions.</p><br/><p>When I introduced myself,</p><br/><p>\u300cHeh, so you\u2019re this time\u2019s main character, huh. So, why are you being hunted?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. I have never heard of a slime becoming a demon lord\u300d</p><br/><p>They said, surprised.</p><br/><p>Why am I being hunted, huh? That\u2019s what I would like to know.</p><br/><p>\u300cIya~, no idea, really\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I said and summarized the events up until now.</p><br/><p>While we were at it, I had them tell the tale of how they met Veldora and Ramiris.</p><br/><p>They are a friendly bunch. But, I couldn\u2019t analyze the depth of their powers.</p><br/><p>As expected, all I knew was that they are demon lords.</p><br/><p>After listening to my story, they thus decided\u2026</p><br/><p>While I shouldn\u2019t let my guard down, the demon lords are hardly united.</p><br/><p>At the moment, these two do not believe I had killed Karion\u2013with whom they are good friends.</p><br/><p>While they certainly believed I was capable of it, Grucius\u2019 testimony convinced them otherwise.</p><br/><p>But, if I did not have proof, my subjugation my have been decided by a majority vote.</p><br/><p>Though this is puzzling, had I first called myself a demon lord and killed Karion there would have been no problems, but if I were trick and kill Karion first and then call myself a demon lord, that would have been no good.</p><br/><p>Such are the rules of the powerful demon lords, it seems.</p><br/><p>So, since this time the banquet was hosted with the premise that I killed Karion through deception, my subjugation would have been certainly agreed upon.</p><br/><p>Karion excluded, I now need to get five demon lords to object to the request to overturn it.</p><br/><p>Good thing I discussed these things with the participants.</p><br/><p>In other words, I have fallen into someone\u2019s wicked trap\u2026</p><br/><p>And this realization caused anger to boil within me.</p><br/><p>Though we haven\u2019t met, the culprit is Clayman.</p><br/><p>The problem is Milim who has supported him. If we solve that, the demon lords\u2019 anger would no longer be directed at me.</p><br/><p>Of course, trying to fight all the demon lords at once would be suicide.</p><br/><p>I mean, I can\u2019t perceive the power of the two before me, so there\u2019s no reason to start a pointless battle.</p><br/><p>Of course, that\u2019s as long as they don\u2019t challenge me.</p><br/><p>But demon lords are unexpectedly receptive.</p><br/><p>These two believed my words.</p><br/><p>Though maybe they\u2019re just that pure.</p><br/><p>Veldora, while in the middle of learning to repress his aura, was talking with Dagrule.</p><br/><p>Somehow, he saw the value of my habits through reading the Holy Texts (Manga), and stopped pointlessly releasing his aura.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s really excited about having his opponents underestimate him only to freak them out by suddenly releasing it.</p><br/><p>The monsters of the city, as a result, can live in peace, so we\u2019re certainly grateful. But it\u2019s still strange.</p><br/><p>I know what manga\u2019s knowledge he filled his head with, but this does bother me a bit.</p><br/><p>In short, his brain has been replaced with manga\u2026</p><br/><p>Dagrule is enthusiastically listening to his explanation, nodding and agreeing.</p><br/><p>In the first place, as a Giant whose power increases due to anger, he doesn\u2019t release that much aura.</p><br/><p>In fact, right now his aura is that of a normal human.</p><br/><p>Surely he has already heard everything Veldora has to say\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cSo in other words, if I learn to control my anger, I will obtain new powers!\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, an outrageous conversation reached my ears.</p><br/><p>Hey, heeeey!</p><br/><p>There\u2019s now way a demon lord called \u201cThe Continent\u2019s Anger\u201d could control it and turn it into energy!</p><br/><p>Besides, I wouldn\u2019t want a demon lord who once fought Veldora growing any stronger.</p><br/><p>And anger runs in the Giant\u2019s veins.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s currently a large man surpassing 2 meters in height, but when he goes all out, his body grows five times as large.</p><br/><p>So a rampaging 12 meter tall giant\u2026 a truly troublesome demon lord he is.</p><br/><p>When he was introducing himself earlier, I thought from the bottom of my heart that he was a demon lord I did not want to have visiting my city.</p><br/><p>Anyways, it seems that they have decided to have him practice to control his anger, but that\u2019s no longer my problem.</p><br/><p>If he fails and rampages in his own country\u2026 I\u2019ll just be happy if he doesn\u2019t come to complain to me later.</p><br/><p>The other demon lord, Dino is\u2026</p><br/><p>Having a friendly conversation with Ramiris.</p><br/><p>They seem close, and their conversation smooth.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s probably because Dino was once \u2013 a long time ago \u2013 in her care, so he\u2019s addressing her politely.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Ramiris. Haven\u2019t you shrunk since we last met?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNothing I can do about that! It hasn\u2019t even been 50 years since I was last reborn!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat must be inconvenient. Have you inherited all your memories?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat I have. But, the spirit regresses along with the body you see\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, since I am the strongest, this kind of handicap is natural!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou don\u2019t say. Tell that to Guy and he\u2019ll pluck your wings out!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBah! Do you take me for a fool? Why bring up such a small fry!</p><br/><p>Though I can easily take Guy out with a single punch, I just don\u2019t feel like it!\u300d</p><br/><p>This, too, seems like a fun conversation.</p><br/><p>Seems like Ramiris is panicking just from hearing the name \u201cGuy\u201d. If her mouth\u2019s running off that much, he must be a truly dangerous guy.</p><br/><p>So let\u2019s make a mental memo: \u201cGuy is dangerous\u201d.</p><br/><p>Like this, I might be able to avoid danger some day. So no ridiculing her.</p><br/><p>The conversation eventually led them to discussing their subordinates.</p><br/><p>Ramiris was proudly showing off Beretta.</p><br/><p>\u300cWith him, I can finally pay back the demon lords for calling me a runt and loner.</p><br/><p>Even you are no match for him!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Can I break him?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHaaah? Of course you can\u2019t!</p><br/><p>If you do\u2026 I\u2019ll go to Guy and have him punch you as punishment!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOr so I say, but isn\u2019t this amazing? If I look closely, he\u2019s truly dangerous!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dino, whose eyes were half asleep until now, suddenly opened wide.</p><br/><p>And pleased by the result,</p><br/><p>\u300cRight! Right, right! Well, now even my persuasiveness must have increased\u300d</p><br/><p>She said, while trying to emphasize her non-existent chest.</p><br/><p>Well, I had built him, though. Not that I care.</p><br/><p>Whether Beretta is fed up with her by now is unknown, but he\u2019s silently carrying out his guardian duties.</p><br/><p>Things continued on like this for a while, but then I decided to ask.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, where are we headed?</p><br/><p>We have been continuing down this path for a while, but you two do know where the banquet will be held, right?</p><br/><p>Oh, and are you not bringing anyone with you?\u300d</p><br/><p>From what I could see, they were only happily walking nowhere.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing my question, the two looked at each other and laughed.</p><br/><p>From what they said, they didn\u2019t want to oversleep, so set off a bit early.</p><br/><p>And upon spotting us, decided that we might as well journey together.</p><br/><p>In any case, we don\u2019t know the way and neither do they.</p><br/><p>But, well</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cWe\u2019ll have someone come and get us\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>They said, carefree.</p><br/><p>Since we were getting tired from walking, we decided to have some tea.</p><br/><p>I took it out from within my stomach, and setting some tableware and sheets, started preparing it.</p><br/><p>If someone would come get us, we might as well have waited in the city.</p><br/><p>Well, I guess I should be happy to have met two demon lords.</p><br/><p>While I was taking out the lunch that Shuna had prepared, the two were behaving themselves.</p><br/><p>Since she made quite a lot, we could easily serve two more people.</p><br/><p>The taste, of course, received rave reviews.</p><br/><p>As expected of Shuna.</p><br/><p>By the way, Shion was not permitted to cook.</p><br/><p>Though she does possess the unique skill\u300eCook\u300f, not knowing the basic makes it a huge waste of talent.</p><br/><p>After the meal, while we were enjoying the tea,</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, are you not bringing anyone with you?\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>They brought Dagruel\u2019s three sons\u2013generals, and five captains with them.</p><br/><p>Since generals and captains have participated in the banquet before, they thought it should be fine.</p><br/><p>But his sons are here for the first time. So they\u2019re bound to cause problems, he said.</p><br/><p>Is that fine? I wanted to ask, but couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Dino has no one with him.</p><br/><p>Seems like there are demon lords with no followers. Milim seems the same, so that I can easily accept.</p><br/><p>By the way, there\u2019s a reason for restricting the number of participants.</p><br/><p>A long time ago, there were demon lords who would bring over a hundred individuals to flaunt their power.</p><br/><p>Some had their countries reduced to ash so came seeking to be annihilated.</p><br/><p>So, they decided that you had to bring someone of at least low class devil ranking.</p><br/><p>According to the now ruined demon lords, they had always brought high ranking devils, but no one can confirm that and such reports have been ignored.</p><br/><p>Anyways, in order to prevent such foolish actions, they decided to limit the number of participants.</p><br/><p>Though there are many demon lords who participate with a clear lack of confidence.</p><br/><p>While we were discussing these things, I suddenly felt a rift open up in space.</p><br/><p>Seems like our guide has come.</p><br/><p>In front of us, a gate has opened.</p><br/><p>From within, a beautiful woman wearing black maid outfit came out and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have come to guide you, Ramiris-sama.</p><br/><p>If you will, please follow me\u300d</p><br/><p>She said, while keeping the gate open.</p><br/><p>While completely making herself seem unimportant. She was the embodiment of discipline itself.</p><br/><p>A true professional.</p><br/><p>But, moreover,</p><br/><p>This maid, feels as overwhelming as Diablo\u2013the \u201cDemon Lord/Official\u201d.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s clearly dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, if it isn\u2019t Mizari. It\u2019s been a while! How\u2019s Guy doing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy, the likes of me is not so presumptuous as to worry for my great master\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, is that so. You never change. Whatever\u300d</p><br/><p>She says while jumping into the gate.</p><br/><p>We followed. If we\u2019re left behind here, there\u2019s the fear of not being able to come here at all.</p><br/><p>But the maid is Guy\u2019s subordinate, it seems.</p><br/><p>Seems like Guy is one of the demon lords, but, if possible, I would rather not make him my enemy.</p><br/><p>Well, that depends on the situation, though.</p><br/><p>The time to test my resolution has come.</p><br/><p>Ahead await the rulers of this world.</p><br/><p>But I was not afraid.</p><br/><p>Because I, too, am one of these strongest individuals.</p><br/><p>While steeling myself, I proceeded into the gate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Diablo was so impressed that he left a lot of matters to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what did Moss say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get so excited. According to the collaborator\u2013William, Laplace is doing well. The combat instructors were better than expected and were trying to resist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s obvious. The academy is sponsored by Lord Rimuru. They have no need for useless people there.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Souei ignored Diablo\u2019s words and talked about the report from William.</p><br/><p>And he knew full well that Diablo would be furious upon hearing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that there were teachers who didn\u2019t try to protect the students.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo became enraged in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them all. That\u2019s what we should tell Moss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo said with a smile.</p><br/><p>There was no will to differentiate there. He wanted everyone other than Rimuru and the students massacred.</p><br/><p>Souei sighed deeply and then continued without changing his expression.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\">Translations by AsianHobbyist Website</div><br/><p>\u201cI told you not to get too excited. Lord Rimuru has gone through the trouble of going out there for the very purpose of exposing those wretches. Lord Rimuru is not one to throw away the entire box because of one rotten fruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind those words lay a certain sentiment: Lord Rimuru would never allow such a thing, you idiot!</p><br/><p>Diablo realized this and retaliated to Souei.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That may be. But Lord Rimuru shouldn\u2019t have to be bothered by such a small thing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, I agree with that. And that is why we will deal with whoever mixed the rotten fruits in the box. It will have to be severe, so they will never think of something so foolish ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? So, there is a possibility that someone is deliberately meddling with the academy. Is that what you are saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. However, it is still under investigation whether it is coming from within the academy or from the outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing these words, Diablo\u2019s eye narrowed and he smiled.</p><br/><p>It might have seemed like a gentle expression, but it was actually an incredibly cold one.</p><br/><p>So much so, that some of the women who saw him as they walked passed them on the streets ended up losing consciousness.</p><br/><p>This both satisfied and calmed Diablo to a certain degree, and so he asked Souei to continue.</p><br/><p>He had decided to hold back on his wrath until the time came to differentiate and judge those who were to be dealt with.</p><br/><p>Souei had been right all along.</p><br/><p>Once Diablo had become calm, he could immediately realize that there was no way that Rimuru would allow them to waste the personnel that he had spent so much effort in raising.</p><br/><p>It was only normal for him to work to remove the root of the problem instead.</p><br/><p>Souei saw that Diablo was satisfied with this, and continued his explanation.</p><br/><p>Currently, the only people who know of Rimuru\u2019s identity were the teachers who William, the collaborator, had seen as trustworthy.</p><br/><p>Souei had also agreed to this and had seen it as a convenient thing for Rimuru in the reeducation of the students.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. However, what if this William doesn\u2019t have the best judgment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that happens, then we\u2019ll have to kill them all, including William.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\"></div><br/><p>Souei said bluntly.</p><br/><p>Souei himself felt that it was his error that he had not realized the current situation at the academy until Rimuru had pointed it out. And while he would make distinctions unlike Diablo, he meant to still put a purge into effect.</p><br/><p>Diablo liked his answer and readily agreed.</p><br/><p>It would not be good to bother Rimuru while he enjoyed the island. Both of them agreed on that point and also on the point that they should avoid any meddling past a certain point.</p><br/><p>Because of this, they should also respect the decisions of the teachers there and leave the rest to Rimuru.</p><br/><p>They would carry out the orders that they had been given.</p><br/><p>That was the answer that they settled on.</p><br/><p>Diablo and Souei looked at each other and nodded before walking through the gates of the Tempest Development of Human Resources Academy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

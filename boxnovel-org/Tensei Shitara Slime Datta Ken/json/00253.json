This is Satoru-chan. He\u2019s a new student enrolling this year. I was just about to ask him where he plans to get in to.\u201d</p><div></div><br/><p>Don\u2019t joke around with me, I told you to use -kun, didn\u2019t I?</p><br/><p>Looks like he is quite the confident type who doesn\u2019t really listen to others.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this kid\u2026 despite being less than a student who hasn\u2019t even enrolled yet, isn\u2019t he being too cheeky to a senpai?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female student called Rozari came b.u.t.ting into our conversation, judging me as cheeky.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s fine and all but I don\u2019t see any reason for them to be so self-important by being senpai when I haven\u2019t even enrolled yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheeky\u2026 now listen here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. The only people allowed to talk to me are fourth year students. Either that, or people who are within rank 100 based on results. I am not someone people like you can speak to. If you understand then give up your seat already!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looks like she doesn\u2019t plan on listening to me at all and acted like she was driving out a dog.</p><br/><p>She probably wants the seat next to Magnus.</p><br/><p>She probably likes him or something and I am in the way.</p><br/><p>This is extremely bothersome.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you were to talk about being a senpai and what not, it doesn\u2019t matter to me as I am not even a student yet. Besides, I couldn\u2019t care less if you are a fourth year student or whatever. I don\u2019t plan on giving up this seat so you better get lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>To my reply, Rozari began shaking in anger.</p><br/><p>And then left, saying \u2018you will regret this\u2019 and giving me a scornful glance.</p><br/><p>The general age at which students get enrolled to the academies is around 15, when the body is complete. It is normal to increase one\u2019s fundamental academic skills at a near educational inst.i.tute until then.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s an admission exam, so if one can pa.s.s that, they can enter the academy.</p><br/><p>The highest grade is the 6th year grade so one would have quite the merit if they are in the fourth year.</p><br/><p>And so it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand why she was being so pompous but I can\u2019t accept the att.i.tude of looking down on others.</p><br/><p>\u201cOho, you can sure talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat n.o.ble, and now that woman and her meaningless pompousness, is the academy really okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahaha. Well, it does hurt when you say it like that. I mean, you are considered an elite if you graduate from the academy, right? And so the people who rank high in results tend to be very arrogant. She isn\u2019t a bad kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I guess that needs to be fixed as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>I aborted the conversation to dodge the topic.</p><br/><p>These kids are like problem children themselves.</p><br/><p>Who knows what kind of problems my Tempest Development of Human Resources Academy is facing.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a relief that that red-haired student had his ideals right but it is also a concern because he is being too docile. However, since there are some discriminating even among the teachers, this is a huge problem.</p><br/><p>If there are students and teachers like these all over the academy, I can\u2019t help but think there\u2019s someone intently wanting me to know about this so that I can eliminate the corruption\u2026</p><br/><p>Right, for example-</p><br/><p><i>&gt;</i></p><br/><p><i>Eh, *fuming*\u2026\u2026?</i></p><br/><p><i>It is true that I doubted this might be one of Ciel\u2019s scheme but she went and dodged the question before I even asked.</i></p><br/><p><i>But, I too am learning. Judging from how she said that, she isn\u2019t denying it.</i></p><br/><p><i>\u2018I didn\u2019t do it\u2019-she isn\u2019t declaring that. That was the moment I started doubting Ciel-san even more.</i></p><br/><p><i>&gt;</i></p><br/><p><i>Eh?! You had a right to remain silent? That\u2019s the first I am hearing of it\u2026</i></p><br/><p><i>Well, that\u2019s fine.</i></p><br/><p>I do feel like that itself is like an answer.</p><br/><p>Besides, this isn\u2019t something I can neglect.</p><br/><p>&lt;well, then?=\u201d\u201d&gt;&gt;&lt;/well,&gt;</p><br/><p>Yeah, it seems like I might need to take some drastic measures.</p><br/><p>&gt;</p><br/><p>Then, is there an unpopulated island on this flight route? With a lower level of danger, if possible.</p><br/><p><i>&gt;</i></p><br/><p><i>Lower cla.s.s demon lord seed?!</i></p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s danger level low?-or so I thought but it seems like Ciel-san is also annoyed by the students\u2019 att.i.tude.</i></p><br/><p><i>I guess it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a bother, so that island will do.</i></p><br/><p><i>I thought of a plan to give the pep talk.</i></p><br/><p><i>Arrogant people who can\u2019t rid their n.o.ble-like feeling.</i></p><br/><p><i>Overconfident youngsters.</i></p><br/><p><i>Even with a sense of justice, too docile youngsters.</i></p><br/><p><i>There\u2019s a problem with every one of them.</i></p><br/><p><i>The teacher is out of the question as his disposal is confirmed but I would like to believe that the students can be rectified.</i></p><br/><p><i>And for that\u2026</i></p><br/><p><i>I guess I will ask for cooperation from the person who probably knows my situation at the moment. And while I am at it, might as drag in the idle ones.</i></p><br/><p><i>&gt;</i></p><br/><p><i>And like that, I got to know of the inside situation of the academy and decided on going forward with a plan to improve it.</i></p><br/><p><i>10 days until the forum.</i></p><br/><p><i>The question is, whether I will be able to rectify these guys without letting them find out who I am.</i></p><br/><p><i>Looks like first time in a while, it\u2019s time for the teacher part of me to take the stage.</i></p><br/><p><i>While thinking of a plan to reform these distorted students, I was feeling excited.</i></p><br/><p><i>And then, I contacted the only person who knew about my movement.</i></p><br/><p><i>Proofreader\u2019s Notes: Didn\u2019t I see this plot in Gilligan\u2019s Island? ?

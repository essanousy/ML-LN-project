Humanization!!!</p><br/><p>I enter a simple tent, newly set up for my personal needs.</p><br/><p>No one can enter! I said and closed the door.</p><br/><p>Ku kuku, Kuha ha, Ku ha hahaha!</p><br/><p>I correctly execute a three-stage laughter. (TL: it likes how villains laugh. Like the one Verudora use in chapter 3.)</p><br/><p>\u201cTraaaaan~ form!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although there aren\u2019t any sound effects, executing Mimicry: Human!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a first time I\u2019m looking forward to the mimicked body this much.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>............ What?</p><br/><p>Oyaoyaoya.....</p><br/><p>The black fog that always appeared during mimicking didn\u2019t come out.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on! So, I thought, but my eye level became slightly higher.</p><br/><p>I could also feel hands and feet.</p><br/><p>And, my skin color changed from the normal pale blue.</p><br/><p>Mu, mu mumu?</p><br/><p>Though I don\u2019t really get it, I feel somewhat different than from what I had intended.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a shame that there was no mirror.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>Although, I don\u2019t want to admit it but I remember once feeling the same way.</p><br/><p>A long time ago\u2026 around 30 years ago.</p><br/><p>Feels just like when I had been attending elementary school.</p><br/><p>I wanted to stop to think for a bit.</p><br/><p>But there was something I had just notice; there was a big difference.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s gone.</p><br/><p>In the new form I had taken, my Son had been missing....!!!!!!</p><br/><p>What is the meaning of this?</p><br/><p>I panicked.</p><br/><p>I immediately went to check.</p><br/><p>Thus, I came to know a shocking fact....</p><br/><p>No...., none.</p><br/><p>Smooth, there was nothing.</p><br/><p>We~ll well, if you think about it, when I mimicry monsters, I had never wondered about such things.</p><br/><p>With no need for excretion, I can\u2019t be expecting to suddenly have those organs, can I\u2026</p><br/><p>An obvious truth\u2026 I, who doesn\u2019t reproduce, has no need for reproductive organs.</p><br/><p>The answer......, the state I in right now, the fact was.....</p><br/><p>With deep sense of loss, I understand! Suddenly a worry beset me.</p><br/><p>No way! I try checking my head in a hurry. It had bushy and soft feel.</p><br/><p>I let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t look like an alien or some suspicious person\u2026 thank goodness!</p><br/><p>Come to think about it, the black wolf\u2019s fur was also bushy.</p><br/><p>Just imagining a fur-less monsters makes me feel bad.....</p><br/><p>Stop. Any further thoughts may prove dangerous.</p><br/><p>Now, had I, who always maintains a cool head, became flustered?</p><br/><p>By this time, I had already accepted the thing regarding my son.</p><br/><p>However, it\u2019s rather painful that I can\u2019t check this body......</p><br/><p>And then, a nice idea comes to mind. Can I use \u201cClones\u201d?</p><br/><p>As expected from myself.</p><br/><p>Whether it\u2019s possible to use in this state\u2014I don\u2019t know; but, let\u2019s try it.</p><br/><p>Black fog gushes out from my body, it gathers in front of my eyes and turns into human form.</p><br/><p>In a moment, it completed.</p><br/><p>This.... is dangerous</p><br/><p>It\u2019s dangerous, in many ways</p><br/><p>First the appearance.</p><br/><p>The figure is lovely silver haired, beautiful girl? Or beautiful boy? It\u2019s natural because there is no sex, but....</p><br/><p>In any case, the features were more like those of a girl.</p><br/><p>Probably, because the original body was Shizu-san\u2019s, my genes were nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>That was, well\u2026 probably to be expected.</p><br/><p>A lovely child, standing naked. Well, there are no parts to be hidden\u2026</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not the problem, this seems morally dangerous.</p><br/><p>But, the insanely cute face. To Shizu-san &gt; GOOD JOB! Let me say that.</p><br/><p>I was a Nice Guy, but never this beautiful.</p><br/><p>Thus, I honestly thank you.</p><br/><p>I was wrapped in fur, and the clone also appeared with it.</p><br/><p>Right now, I still had not prepared any clothes.</p><br/><p>The reason why it\u2019s dangerous was.</p><br/><p>Because of its abilities.</p><br/><p>The clone had excellent thinking capabilities, and completely linked to me.</p><br/><p>Which mean, both are me.</p><br/><p>There is no difference between the main body and the clone.</p><br/><p>No, the ability of the flame giant (Ifrit)\u2019s clones clearly are inferior.</p><br/><p>Yet, I feel that my clone are not inferior. No, I wonder if it is lacking.....</p><br/><p>There are differences.</p><br/><p>In the magic power capacity. Originally the amount of magic power you can use is limited. It can\u2019t use more than originally given to it.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s possible to keep giving it more magic power, however.</p><br/><p>I have quite a lot of magic power. Depending on how I use it, it can be pretty powerful.</p><br/><p>However, the flame giant (Ifrit)\u2019s created about 10 clones,whereas my high performance clones are limited to a single body.</p><br/><p>Though, if seen from opponent\u2019s side, it\u2019s definitely a cheat.</p><br/><p>The last reason.</p><br/><p>There was a lack of discomfort when mimicking..</p><br/><p>I noticed it when the black fog did not occur.</p><br/><p>For example, black wolf.</p><br/><p>When turning into the black wolf, the mimicry configures it inside the black fog. But, it\u2019s inferior to slime\u2019s body abilities.</p><br/><p>Even though slime\u2019s body doesn\u2019t have limbs, there are no restrictions on its physical movement, because the cell abilities were abnormally high.</p><br/><p>Each one of the cells is muscle, brain, and also nerve.</p><br/><p>Do you get it? The eye transmits information that the brain then processes.</p><br/><p>But the slime avoids this process.</p><br/><p>With \u201cGreat Sage\u201d correction my perception speed are 1000 times the norm. Thus my reaction speed, is far about the ordinary person.</p><br/><p>However, the body created inside the black fog has some lag-time\u2014for the thoughts to reach the brain=actual brain.</p><br/><p>Perhaps,the drop in quality of the clone was caused by this.</p><br/><p>But, mimicking the human being does not release black fog....?</p><br/><p>Because its reaction speed is equal to the slime. Thus, no discomfort.</p><br/><p>And, due the fact that there are limbs now, its motor movements are better\u2026 But, it\u2019s a child.</p><br/><p>Still, it\u2019s easier to move than as slime.</p><br/><p>Also, because there no need for black fog, there is no need to consume magic power.</p><br/><p>From now on, let\u2019s try considering this as the main form! So I thought.</p><br/><p>Suddenly I got an idea, so I issue an order to the clone.</p><br/><p>To change itself, smoothly.</p><br/><p>The clone began to growth!!!</p><br/><p>The physique becomes slurry. Fluttering Silver hair. Beautiful, medieval looks</p><br/><p>Perfect!</p><br/><p>Furthermore from it, it can change into woman or man of any type.</p><br/><p>It can become macho or fat, it also can became young man or old man.</p><br/><p>I found it possible to mimic into variety of conditions. Also, the reason for the black fog was apparently to accommodate the additional mass, so turning into an adult requires it.</p><br/><p>This might be good as I can thus enhance my physical strength.</p><br/><p>Although the reaction speed decreases, it is more advantageous to have larger strength.</p><br/><p>Well, speed are also one of the more important elements in a fight! So, I think.</p><br/><p>From then on I carried out more experiments, and got used to this body\u2019 abilities.</p><br/><p>Thus I, in this world,got my hands on a human body!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Admission letters. Acceptance letters. Rewards. Various documents, with my name blurred out. I can\u2019t seem to remember it.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Didn\u2019t the doctor address you somehow?</p><br/><p>Clown: I wasn\u2019t listening.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: You addressed me as Aiko, your sister. What was her last name?</p><br/><p>Clown: Kanzaki.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: So wouldn\u2019t that be your last name?</p><br/><p>Clown: Perhaps it would?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: And remember that police came to see some Kanzaki\u2026 what was the name?</p><br/><p>Clown: Kanzaki\u2026 I don\u2019t remember!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Well, at times like this\u2026</p><br/><p>Clown: At times like this\u2026?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Tell a joke!</p><br/><p>Clown: My existence.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: That\u2019s not very funny.</p><br/><p>Clown: Fine\u2026A man who worked in a cruise liner as a magician had a parrot and every time the man did a trick the parrot yelled, \u201cit\u2019s in the pocket,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s in the pocket,\u201d the magician would do another trick and the parrot yelled, \u201cit\u2019s in the hat\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s in the hat.\u201d</p><br/><p>One day during his act the cruise liner had a problem and the ship sunk. The parrot came up from the water and looking confused said; \u201cNOW WHERE DID HE HIDE THE SHIP.\u201d</p><br/><p>Birth of a Demon Lord</p><br/><p>075. Conference</p><br/><p>Every member of every department assembled in the large meeting hall.</p><br/><p>As for Ranga, I had forgotten that he was sleeping within my shadow.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s in sleep-mode\u2013conscious but unable to move.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t measure his abilities, but it is clear that he\u2019s undergoing some kind of evolution.</p><br/><p>Well, he\u2019ll probably come running out if I wind up in some perilous situation.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s rather uninterested in the conference but is nonetheless listening.</p><br/><p>I guess it\u2019s time to begin.</p><br/><p>The moment I thought to declare that the meeting has begun,</p><br/><p>\u300cI apologize for the intrusion in the middle of the meeting!</p><br/><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, a guest has arrived.</p><br/><p>Here on an urgent matter and requests immediate audience with you\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>A soldier on look-out ran in and so reported.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo was about to reprimand the soldier, but Kaijin calmed him down.</p><br/><p>We haven\u2019t begun yet, so it\u2019s fine. However, it is troubling that people can so easily enter here.</p><br/><p>\u300cRigurdo, we need to look into this later\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy. I am truly ashamed of myself.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNah, we just got the idea and everyone\u2019s working hard as is\u300d</p><br/><p>I replied, comforting him.</p><br/><p>In fact, even if we find something lacking we only need to improve for later.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s probably best to think of the long-term benefit.</p><br/><p>I had that guest escorted here.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s been a long time, Rimuru-dono.</p><br/><p>We have come to aid you during your time of need. We hope it is not too late\u300d</p><br/><p>With these words, the Brumund Kingdom\u2019s Freedom Association Guild Master Fuze came in.</p><br/><p>Fully armed, prepared for battle.</p><br/><p>Hmm? Hmmmmm?</p><br/><p>If I think about it, it\u2019s been what, 10 days since we had the 50 adventurers and merchants go?</p><br/><p>And we had them deliver the information and request assistance, I think.</p><br/><p>I am truly grateful, but are they okay associating with us?</p><br/><p>\u300cI apologize for disturbing you during your busy war preparations.</p><br/><p>However, we found your defenses lacking. The Farmas Kingdom\u2019s main force has yet to arrive, right?</p><br/><p>According to our intel, a total of 15 thousand troops are coming.</p><br/><p>Though it may improve your morale, I hardly see this as a right time to be merry.</p><br/><p>Though we may lack in ability, we will support you to the best of our ability\u300d</p><br/><p>Clearly prepared to die, he delivered this heated address.</p><br/><p>Yup. It\u2019s really hard to tell him that the war\u2019s already over.</p><br/><p>And continuing,</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is a good city.</p><br/><p>Carefully built houses decorate your well planned streets.</p><br/><p>The paved roads wouldn\u2019t lose even to the Royal Capital.</p><br/><p>I was surprised.</p><br/><p>Hardly would I want to turn it into a field off battle. I suggest we launch a surprise attack to quickly destroy the enemy\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>We have heard the church backs the enemy.</p><br/><p>So, we have brought over 50 B rank and above adventurers.</p><br/><p>The country cannot openly support you. I hope you understand\u2026</p><br/><p>But the fifty of us will cut deep into the enemy ranks and slaughter\u2026 \u300d</p><br/><p>The department members are staring blankly at Fuze, who is continuing the passionate speech.</p><br/><p>To us it\u2019s all\u2026 been there, done that type of thing.</p><br/><p>But I had expected Brumund to abandon us. To think they really sent reinforcements\u2026</p><br/><p>Though we do have an agreement with them, surely there was a way out\u2026</p><br/><p>This makes me kind of happy.</p><br/><p>But that being so.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. I appreciate the sentiment, but it\u2019s already over\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOver? What do you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow should I say this\u2026</p><br/><p>In other words. In a few words, I annihilated them!\u300d</p><br/><p>Although he was speechless, his face was clearly saying \u201cHuuuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Youmu came up to pat him on the shoulder and Cabal was saying something to comfort him.</p><br/><p>Ellen and Gido were saying things like \u201cUnbelievable, right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, I guess it is</p><br/><p>I mean, not even two weeks have passed since they declared war.</p><br/><p>They were probably expecting the army to take a week to reach here, us to buy two or three days fighting in the fields, and, if worst came to worst, hole up in the fort.</p><br/><p>So when they arrive and saw us carefree, they seem to have convinced themselves that the army was running late.</p><br/><p>Though we were so merry that they did suspect that something was off\u2026</p><br/><p>Anyways, thanks to Ellen\u2019s and Cabal\u2019s explanation, they seemed to have understood the situation.</p><br/><p>So we had our soldiers escort the fifty men waiting outside to the inn\u2013to relax.</p><br/><p>Since it came to this, I might as well have Fuze participate in the conference.</p><br/><p>Though he can\u2019t represent Brumund Kingdom\u2019s official position, he can at least offer a human opinion.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s begin the conference! I wanted to say, but</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, would you have a moment?\u300d</p><br/><p>Bester asked, raising his hand.</p><br/><p>Did something happen?</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? Is there a problem?\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked,</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. The thing is, we finished developing the magic item long distance communication ball\u2026</p><br/><p>It is now possible to converse while seeing the other party\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmph.</p><br/><p>A wonderful invention, but why bring it up now?</p><br/><p>I thought, but</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen I reported the event to the Dwarf King, he told me that he had some things he wanted to say\u2026</p><br/><p>So since we are all gathered here, I kind of figured this might be a good time\u300d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s it, I don\u2019t see a problem.</p><br/><p>\u300cBester. I don\u2019t mind, but shouldn\u2019t the conversation be held in secrecy?</p><br/><p>We have Youmu and Association\u2019s Chief over here, so is it fine?</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s a private conversation, shouldn\u2019t we hold it later?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, not at all. The Dwarf King also wishes to mention some things regarding future international relations\u2026</p><br/><p>When I told him about today\u2019s conference, he said that he\u2019ll assemble his Ministers as well\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo they are currently waiting over there?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. That\u2019s how it is\u300d</p><br/><p>I see\u2026 we never did announce the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Dwarf Kingdom.</p><br/><p>The two contracts that we have are the non-aggression treaty and the technological cooperation treaty.</p><br/><p>Though those would be meaningless if our country ceases to exist. However, we now have the advantage.</p><br/><p>I believe that the previous events are of a magnitude that they cannot ignore.</p><br/><p>If anything, we proved to be a country that can destroy and army of 15 thousand men.</p><br/><p>Will they officially declare diplomatic relations between us or perhaps seek to destroy us as humanity\u2019s enemy?</p><br/><p>\u300cBester, I have to ask, did you tell him that I have become a demon lord?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes. I told him everything\u300d</p><br/><p>Ah, as expected.</p><br/><p>He should have only confirmed it this morning so for him to so quickly assemble the ministers only evinces how gravely he views the situation.</p><br/><p>Well, if you were told that demon lord class monster created a city and evolved into a demon lord, surely you\u2019d sweat a bit.</p><br/><p>He would learn of this sooner or later though. So this might be a good chance.</p><br/><p>So at this point, continuing the conversation as is will probably not cause any further problems.</p><br/><p>I mean, while planning our next steps I did want to hear his opinion.</p><br/><p>\u300cGot it. Then bring the communication equipment and set it up.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll wait for you and prepare for the emergency council\u300d</p><br/><p>I declared.</p><br/><p>This is a sudden development, but also a good opportunity.</p><br/><p>We\u2019re deciding our future here, after all.</p><br/><p>Thus, we decided to hold a global conference instead of meeting right now, scheduling it an hour away.</p><br/><p>Right after relaxing, Fuze heard our conversation and with an amazing look on his face ran up to me.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, didn\u2019t you just say something really important right now?</p><br/><p>I might be wrong, but did you just say that you became a demon lord?\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, trembling.</p><br/><p>Does he need to pee? No need to hold back man, we have bathrooms around.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Ah, demon lord, right?</p><br/><p>I did become one, what of it?</p><br/><p>But more importantly, before you piss yourself, shouldn\u2019t you use a restroom? \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you an idiot?! There\u2019s no time for that!</p><br/><p>Became a demon lord, yo! What\u2019s up with that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Eh~. What a pain.</p><br/><p>From the beginning? No good if I don\u2019t explain it from the beginning?</p><br/><p>Well, I did tell him I annihilated an army but I guess I can\u2019t expect him to guess the rest.</p><br/><p>I decided to summarize the events and explain.</p><br/><p>And so, I explained it all to Fuze.</p><br/><p>\u300cPardon the intrusion! Another guest seeks audience with Rimuru-sama.</p><br/><p>How should we proceed?\u300d</p><br/><p>The same soldier as last time asked.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that. So many guests these days.</p><br/><p>Leaving Fuze, who was saying something (grumbling) at the sky, I decided to meet this guest.</p><br/><p>I headed for the room where the guest was waiting for me.</p><br/><p>When I entered, I saw an exquisitely dressed gentleman and five men who had an air of experienced officers about them.</p><br/><p>The gentleman was sitting on the sofa with the five officers standing behind him.</p><br/><p>I could easily see that they were well trained.</p><br/><p>The gentleman sitting on the sofa had a good face and could easily had been a model in his younger days.</p><br/><p>His narrow eyes would be his distinguishing feature.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, good day. Sorry for the wait.</p><br/><p>Pleased to meet you, I am Rimuru, currently working as this city\u2019s King.</p><br/><p>I hope we get along!\u300d</p><br/><p>I greeted them in a way I thought appropriate.</p><br/><p>Though I became a demon lord, I have no clue about manners or formalities.</p><br/><p>Nor does anyone around here know much about it\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, I do think that it would be nice to be taught these things, though.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing my greeting, the narrow eyed man stood up.</p><br/><p>And opening his eye wide with a Kuwa!,</p><br/><p>\u300cSo thou art the demon who hath bewitched my daughter?</p><br/><p>Hast thou said thy prayers!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, beginning to chant an extremely high combustion spell.</p><br/><p>Hey! This geezer is nuts.</p><br/><p>From what I see, that\u2019s the highest tier spell he got going there.</p><br/><p>At this power level it would certainly cause some damage to the city.</p><br/><p>Clearly a spell used against armies.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this guy on? I have no idea what he\u2019s saying.</p><br/><p>I tricked his daughter? What\u2019s that about?</p><br/><p>Right as I was completely at a loss,</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, Papa! Why did you come here?!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ellen came flying in.</p><br/><p>And perhaps after realizing the spell from a single glance, she hit the gentleman squarely on the head.</p><br/><p>A beautiful \u201cSuppaaaa!\u201d sound resounded through the room, and the gentleman regained his sanity.</p><br/><p>It seems that this gentleman geezer is Ellen\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>And after hearing Ellen\u2019s explanation, he finally calmed down.</p><br/><p>What an annoying guy he is.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy~, A ha ha ha. My bad.</p><br/><p>I had heard that my daughter was captured by some demon lord so I was quite panicked!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>Even so, what point was there in preparing the highest tier combustion spell? What a ridiculous father.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, Your Excellency. The received report was correct but you jumped to a wrong conclusion\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI knew it, Papa\u2019s at fault here!\u300d</p><br/><p>A secretary-like person and Ellen ganged up on him.</p><br/><p>That is kind of pitiful, but I don\u2019t feel any sympathy towards him. He\u2019s just paying for his own stupidity.</p><br/><p>After things calmed down, he introduced himself again.</p><br/><p>Ellen\u2019s father, the narrow eyed gentlemen, is a high noble of Sorcerer\u2019s Dynasty Sarion, Duke Elalude.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s related to the emperor, his uncle to be precise.</p><br/><p>In short, he\u2019s one of the three bigwigs of Sarion.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t hide my surprise.</p><br/><p>E-Ellen is a true ojou-sama?!</p><br/><p>She can even be called a princess. To become an adventurer at that social status; she\u2019s too free-willed.</p><br/><p>I do think that those stopping her are correct, but I won\u2019t do it myself.</p><br/><p>I mean, she herself doesn\u2019t seem to care. There\u2019s probably people protecting her from the shadows as well.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve done well not to let information slip.</p><br/><p>Though that\u2019s probably the result of Cabal\u2019s and Gido\u2019s hard work. Let\u2019s thank them for it later.</p><br/><p>But, now.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo is the purpose of your visit limited to Ellen only?\u300d</p><br/><p>That wouldn\u2019t be funny.</p><br/><p>I glance at Duke Elalude,</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu. Of course, that\u2019s not the case.</p><br/><p>We are in considering how we should treat your country from now on, so I came to see it myself.</p><br/><p>No need to worry believing I was careless. This body is only a homunculus.\u300d</p><br/><p>I noticed upon his words.</p><br/><p>For someone important from the Sorcerer\u2019s Dynasty, his body houses very little magical energy.</p><br/><p>Though the officers seem to be real, the gentleman\u2019s body is not.</p><br/><p>As expected of a high noble. He\u2019s careful.</p><br/><p>But more importantly.</p><br/><p>I want to learn how to make homunculi later.</p><br/><p>And that brings us to the next point.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll have Duke Elalude participate in the conference as well.</p><br/><p>An hour has passed by now.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s time to start the conference.</p><br/><p>Returning to the large conference room I found everyone waiting for me.</p><br/><p>I had the Duke\u2019s group escorted to a set of empty seats.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably best to start with a self introduction. That is, there are many people here who have connections to large countries.</p><br/><p>So, let\u2019s start it thus.</p><br/><p>First, we\u2019ll have everyone not from Tempest introduce themselves.</p><br/><p>Dwarf Kingdom, military nation Dwargon.</p><br/><p>Representing them: their king himself. Gazelle Dwargo. Though only projected as in image, his dignity is impossible to hide.</p><br/><p>Small country Brumund.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have anyone representing them.</p><br/><p>However, we do have Fuze, the Freedom Association\u2019s Branch Guild Master.</p><br/><p>And, he\u2019s rather friendly with Baron Belouard.</p><br/><p>Though he doesn\u2019t have decisive say, his opinion should have some weight.</p><br/><p>A sudden addition to our table, a high noble from Sorcerer\u2019s Dynasty Sarion.</p><br/><p>Duke Elalude is a no-good doting father, but his current face is that of a stoic noble.</p><br/><p>And, via his position in the council, he holds sway over the whole country.</p><br/><p>So no disrespecting him.</p><br/><p>So looking over the guests, it\u2019s clear that many distinguished individuals have shown up.</p><br/><p>A monster only meeting may lead us to fall into some mistaken conclusion. Thus, I am rather thankful that we have so many participants from the human side.</p><br/><p>Next, we introduced all the members from Tempest.</p><br/><p>And, it was finally my turn.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, right.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s one person I want to introduce to you.</p><br/><p>Though you have probably have heard his name already.</p><br/><p>So please don\u2019t be surprised.</p><br/><p>Now then, come forth!\u300d</p><br/><p>I thus began the introduction.</p><br/><p>Knowing what was to come, Gabil swallowed his saliva and tensed up.</p><br/><p>The air in the room changed, and everyone turned silent.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahahaha! I have been called and here I am!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I called Veldora out via \u201cStorm Dragon Release\u201d.</p><br/><p>Using my clone as a base, he appeared as a beautiful young man.</p><br/><p>Giving everyone a sidelong glance,</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is my best friend, Veldora. Please be kind to him!\u300d</p><br/><p>I introduced him,</p><br/><p>\u300cVeldora\u2019s the name, though I\u2019m called \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d. Pleased to meet you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora greeted everyone.</p><br/><p>Dead silence enveloped the room.</p><br/><p>No one moved.</p><br/><p>And, with a flop, Fuze and Ellen fainted, screaming \u201cAy!!\u201d Rigurdo\u2019s group and the hobgoblins fell prostrate before him\u2026</p><br/><p>It all turned very chaotic.</p><br/><p>Of course, the conference was temporarily suspended for a break.</p><br/><p>\u2026We hadn\u2019t started yet, had we\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help but think.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

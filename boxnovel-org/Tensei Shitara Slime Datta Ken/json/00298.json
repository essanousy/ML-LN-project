And it was an interesting idea to be able to use that power only when you needed it.</p><br/><p>For instance, looking at the power that Guy gave to Leon\u2019s subordinates\u2013\u2019Secret art of Hybrid Soul Fusion,\u2019 is was the fusing of two demons with equal strength.</p><br/><p>This secret art allowed the party with the stronger will to take over. It was like poisoning someone.</p><br/><p>It was a forbidden art. And of course, you could not undo it.</p><br/><p>It was all or nothing.</p><br/><p>It was dangerous, as you had to have the resolve to wager your own soul.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Demon Fusion, which was the art that the empire had developed, was founded on creating manageable contracts with demons who were willing to serve.</p><br/><p>Once safety had been guaranteed, it was possible to fuse when needed.</p><br/><p>Unlike fusing with spirits, you could gain power easily without strengthening your own astral.</p><br/><p>That seemed very convenient.</p><br/><p>But\u2013</p><br/><p>It was a mistake to use demons.</p><br/><p>The price that was to be paid was a fixed sum of magic power. But with that, you could at least feel that pleasure of using the power of the demon that you fused with.</p><br/><p>If you could not honor the contract, then the demon would just leave.</p><br/><p>In other words, when you are unable to go up against stronger opponents.</p><br/><p>It was convenient for opponents that were weaker than you\u2026but it was not very reliable when it mattered.</p><br/><p>Also, the demons left when you were out of magic.</p><br/><p>There were even demons who hurt their summoners because they were bored.</p><br/><p>In the case of Magnus and the others, such actions were prevented by the contracts\u2026but it was likely impossible to control the actions of the demons once you had no magic to use as payment.</p><br/><p>You could not make them work if you had nothing to offer.</p><br/><p>In that case, I could think of a number of ways to beat them.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>They all listened to my explanation and their expressions brightened.</p><br/><p>Up until now, they had despaired because they thought they had no chance of winning.</p><br/><p>Damn it. It really was too bad that they were so quick to give up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Magnus. To have such dangerous power\u2026 When it is so dangerous for us to fight even a Greater Demon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Julius and Karma muttered with pained expressions.</p><br/><p>With this much of a discrepancy between them, they were still serious about fighting. So I could understand why they were so self-pitying\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013Still, it\u2019s not like it was necessary to fight head-on through conventional means.</p><br/><p>But they still wanted to fight properly after hearing my explanation. I didn\u2019t know if I should call it honest or just stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey. Have you been listening to what I\u2019ve been saying? Didn\u2019t you understand that you cannot win by fighting head on, like some honest idiot? Then start thinking differently! Are those heads on your shoulders or just decorations? Why don\u2019t you use those brains!\u201d</p><br/><p>I blasted them a little.</p><br/><p>At these words, the faces of the students became animated again after having been full of despair.</p><br/><p>And then all at once, they began to discuss possible ways of beating them.</p><br/><p>\u201cUsually, when you summon a spirit or demon, it requires a lot of magic. According to a story that I heard, even an advanced summoner can only summon a Greater Demon for about ten minutes at the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that too. Though, they do say that an Elementalist that is recognised as the contractor can have spirits materialize for much longer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never heard of a demon recognizing a human. And if it\u2019s done against their will, it should only be for a short-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on? Does that mean there is a time limit to Magnus\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hmm. Hmm.</p><br/><p>The discussion was getting rather heated in a good way.</p><br/><p>There were advanced demons like Venom, who had recognized Masayuki, but let\u2019s forget about that for now.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

Once we confirm that the devil\u2019s power has been activated, we need to draw out the fight to be as long as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. So that\u2019s what all this physical training was for. Right, Master Satoru!\u201d</p><br/><p>No?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just revenge.</p><br/><p>As if you guys would get stronger after running for one day.</p><br/><p>The only thing you\u2019ll get is aching muscles.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you noticed. You guys sure grew a lot in one day!\u201d</p><br/><p>I suppressed my true feelings and nodded heavily.</p><br/><p>And with that alone\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Satoru!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Several of the idiots shouted with emotion.</p><br/><p>They were too simple\u2026 Well, that part of them was also a little cute.</p><br/><p>After that, the discussion continued. And they eventually had an outline of their new strategy.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So, like that. The combat types will rotate as teams and push Magnus back. The magic types will support them while also disturbing Magnus and the others. What do you think about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Julius represented the others and explained their plan to me.</p><br/><p>This plan was created with consideration to advice from the other teachers as well.</p><br/><p>It seemed that they believed that this was the best thing to do at the moment. And I could see that Julius\u2019s expression had regained much of its confidence.</p><br/><p>I see. Yes.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s definitely well thought out.</p><br/><p>For the most part, it matches my own thoughts on the matter.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;It\u2019s no good at all. The important thing is their direct combat ability against Magnus. It\u2019s completely inadequate. This rotation idea has a zero percent success rate. They won\u2019t even have time to activate any disruption magic. If Magnus gets serious, he will kill their entire vanguard in ten seconds. &gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>True.</p><br/><p>My own thoughts had been way too sloppy.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no good. This plan will end with Magnus and the others killing everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t actually think that Magnus was that ruthless. That\u2019s why I had thought this plan would be fine\u2026</p><br/><p>But Ciel disliked taking the emotions of enemies into account while making calculations.</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t rest easy unless she considered the worst possible scenario, so she could be ready for anything.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;Damn it all. Why don\u2019t they use their brains and at least think of something, such as taming the Poison Tiger.&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>What? You can do that?!</p><br/><p>And, \u2018at least?\u2019 Is there something even higher they can aim for?</p><br/><p>Well, it would be easy for me, I guess\u2026</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;Master, you sent Laplace all the way here to settle things with the owner of the island, but\u2026 It is just deplorable that these students are incapable of thinking. Don\u2019t you agree, Master?&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Uh, yeah.</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s what it was\u2026</p><br/><p>Had I been giving Laplace such orders without knowing it?</p><br/><p>I had sent Laplace to greet the Rock Elephant that ruled the center, and told him to be careful not to be rude\u2026</p><br/><p>But in Ciel\u2019s mind, I had been reading much further ahead.</p><br/><p>I understood everything, she seemed to want to say.</p><br/><p>Well, I didn\u2019t understand it myself. But it was probably better to be quiet about that.</p><br/><p>Just then\u2013</p><br/>\n</div>"}

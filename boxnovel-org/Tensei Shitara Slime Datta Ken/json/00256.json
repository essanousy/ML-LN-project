Please leave it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laplace\u2019s whole face was lit up with a smile and he took Tia and happily rushed out.</p><div></div><br/><p>It would be better to limit the use of Spatial travel so that Milim doesn\u2019t notice. Souei had already decided that this mission would best fitted for Laplace when Souei received the mission from Rimuru at first.</p><br/><p>However, it was their blunder that they didn\u2019t know there was such a rage among airships currently.</p><br/><p>Diablo and Souei reflected on that on the inside.</p><br/><p>And after that, the two of them began discussing about the second objective.</p><br/><p>It had been a while after the ship had taken off.</p><br/><p>Although the duration of flight is affected by the weather, the plane would arrive at Ingracia Academy City within 10 hours.</p><br/><p>However, this time, a certain event will soon commence.</p><br/><p>And exactly when I was thinking of that, Laplace came.</p><br/><p>The announcer had announced that the plane was now entering a state of emergency.</p><br/><p>Magnus kept on talking to me frequently so Laplace really saved me.</p><br/><p>Why do I need to tell this guy about my favourite food or hobby and stuff?</p><br/><p>He isn\u2019t trying to hit on me, is he?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think so \u2019cause I look very plain now as I was wearing round spectacles, a mask and also had black hair.</p><br/><p>Well, I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter since Laplace is here.</p><br/><p>After all, starting now, he won\u2019t have the leeway to be hitting on people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyaaahhaaaa!! This ship is now under the rule of the air pirates-Greed Circus!! Cry, scream and despair as you please!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cheerful voice echoed inside the ship.</p><br/><p>Laplace, that b.a.s.t.a.r.d, looks like he\u2019s enjoying this to the fullest.</p><br/><p>He wanted a letter of marque because he wanted to do this, eh?</p><br/><p>Well, it doesn\u2019t really matter as it won\u2019t really affect me.</p><br/><p>He won\u2019t dare attack any of the Tempest Airline\u2019s ships and it isn\u2019t really fun seeing the ships the other countries develop emerge into the sky.</p><br/><p>For what it matters, I have already confiscated all the techniques related to airships from the Empire.</p><br/><p>It was among one of the conditions to acknowledge the Empire as independent. After all, I would like the monopoly of the sky to remain under Tempest.</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t think it will ever happen but, to prevent the usage of airships in wars between countries, this matter was one of the highest importance.</p><br/><p>After all, if you were to get rid of the skies among sky, land, and the sethere\u2019s only limited area where you can fight.</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t think there are any idiots out there who would come picking a fight with us, it would be difficult to stop other countries from fighting amongst each other. We can be the mediators but intruding in their problems even before a war breaks out would only buy their animosity.</p><br/><p>And when I thought about it considering all that, to have those wars not affect any civilians, removing flying forces would be the most effective.</p><br/><p>Airships are inventions which completely change the concept of wars. And because of this, there was a need for us to keep it to ourselves.</p><br/><p>As such, there was also a need to crush the airship-related inventions made by other countries. And so I was thinking of coming up with something to stop that. So if I were to just leave it to Laplace, he would happily do these tasks.</p><br/><p>All that\u2019s left is to make sure they don\u2019t find out I am the one behind this. I should be careful to not leave any evidence behind.</p><br/><p>While thinking of such things, I was observing the course of events.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest easy. I will protect you!\u201d</p><br/><p>This Magnus dude took my hand and said so without even feeling the least bit embarra.s.sed.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this, what\u2019s this?!-I felt like shouting that out loud.</p><br/><p>What \u2018you can rest easy, I will protect\u2019, huh?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t s.h.i.t around with me, you idiot. In the first place, I told you I\u2019m a guy.</p><br/><p>My heart is undoubtedly that of a guy. This Magnus dude really doesn\u2019t listen to other people.</p><br/><p>I ended up grumbling about him. I guess I will let it rest since I didn\u2019t say it out loud.</p><br/><p>Putting Magnus aside, I should go and do my job.</p><br/><p>A jolt raced through the ship, signifying that Laplace\u2019s ship had connected.</p><br/><p>The c.o.c.kpit is probably in a state of panic right about now.</p><br/><p>First, let\u2019s rest at ease.</p><br/><p>I predicted such situations to occur and installed emergency transmission devices in every ship.</p><br/><p>I brought out a \u2018sticky steel string\u2019 from my fingertip and promptly connected to one of those devices.</p><br/><p>With this, I can produce letters on the monitor using transmission codes.</p><br/><p>It would have been easy if I used \u2018Thought Transmission\u2019 but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I decided to not use skills which leave traces behind as much as possible but this is turning out to be quite difficult.</p><br/><p>Or so I am complaining but actually, I installed these devices \u2019cause I wanted to enjoy moments like these.</p><br/><p>I am glad they are coming in handy. I will keep it a secret that I am having fun feeling like a spy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

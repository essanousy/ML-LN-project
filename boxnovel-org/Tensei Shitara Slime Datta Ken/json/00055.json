Adventurer Registration</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only one thing to do now that we signed the contract.</p><br/><p>Right\u2013celebrate.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t venture into the unseen lands yesterday, but today is different.</p><br/><p>\u300cMyormiles-kun. Do you have any plans after this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufufu, danna also enjoys it, huh. This Myormiles has the perfect shop in mind!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHoho! But, are you aware that I have high standards for these things?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease leave it to me! I am completely certain that you shall be pleased!\u300d</p><br/><p>And thus we spend the night drinking.</p><br/><p>I dare say! What a blissful day!</p><br/><p>And like that for a week.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m still in the care of Myormiles\u2019 establishment.</p><br/><p>Of course, I\u2019m not just messing around the whole day.</p><br/><p>Using\u300eShadow Step\u300fI went to let Rigurdo know about our arrangement with the Brumund Kingdom, and to order Bester to mass produce medicine, among other things.</p><br/><p>I also didn\u2019t forget to order Kaijin and Gerudo to lay a road all the way here.</p><br/><p>And, to have them prepare lodging space for adventurers who would eventually show up and train people to repair armor and weapons.</p><br/><p>Though we just finished one construction spree, everyone seemed eager to start another.</p><br/><p>After giving out orders, I would come back and spend the night drinking; that\u2019s how busily I spent every day.</p><br/><p>Upon receiving my orders the city livened up with action.</p><br/><p>It should be fine to leave it to them. At this rate, they should finish the road within the next two months.</p><br/><p>The money I made from selling medium grade medicine (high potions) totaled 110 gold coins. Combined with what I already had, I currently have 126.</p><br/><p>I gave 100 to Myormiles so that he\u2019d deliver vegetable sprouts and seeds, and spices of every kind to our city. But I still have 26 left.</p><br/><p>Since that\u2019s quite a large sum I planned to splurge to my heart\u2019s content, but there was nothing I wanted to buy.</p><br/><p>The week\u2019s worth of drinking was covered by Myormiles.</p><br/><p>He probably intended to ensure favorable relations considering our future joint endeavors.</p><br/><p>So he really let me have my way. In other words, I received the best treatment imaginable.</p><br/><p>Myormiles is definitely a useful man.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s how I became friends with this merchant.</p><br/><p>But I\u2019m not letting my guard down.</p><br/><p>Myormiles is softening people up with a smile on his face. That\u2019s the mark of a true merchant.</p><br/><p>He also lends out money at the highest interest rate, and I\u2019ve seen many potential customers visit him daily.</p><br/><p>But it seems that he doesn\u2019t meet these people personally; rather, he leaves it to his store attendants.</p><br/><p>As expected of a licensed merchant, he has many ways of making profit.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also some nobles who come to him to borrow some money.</p><br/><p>Debt is a frightening thing. It can always be used.</p><br/><p>Well, since both parties intend to benefit, betrayal is unlikely. Merchants first and foremost consider both party\u2019s profit. Rather than relying on a poor alliance it\u2019s better to establish trustworthiness.</p><br/><p>This whole week I\u2019ve been trying to ascertain his character with intention of confirming viability of future cooperation.</p><br/><p>Signed the contract and arranged future deliveries.</p><br/><p>I guess it\u2019s time to set off on a journey.</p><br/><p>I let Myormiles know my intentions.</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks for the past week. I\u2019ll come to hang out again!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDanna\u2026 I\u2019ll be waiting for your return! Please, please, come again!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. In two months I\u2019ll send a group to guard and lead you to my city.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ll come in my name, so you\u2019ll know it\u2019s them. I leave it to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood!\u300d</p><br/><p>We parted after this exchange.</p><br/><p>The attendants and other customers were surprised at his humility.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t understand why at first, but after thinking for a moment it made sense: shop owner who normally acts arrogantly suddenly acts so humble to a child\u2013certainly a bizarre scene.</p><br/><p>Maybe I should have changed into my adult form during our conversation. Well, too late now.</p><br/><p>And so, I left the shop.</p><br/><p>After leaving I headed straight for the Freedom Association.</p><br/><p>They already wrote an introduction letter to Kagurazaka Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Of course, I\u2019m planning on going to get it, but I also need to finally get an ID in this world.</p><br/><p>The country has promised to recognize my person, so I\u2019ll be registering at the guild.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, I\u2019d have to go from country to country demanding identification every time I visited, and that would be pain.</p><br/><p>If I register as an adventurer, I would be recognized not by a single country but by every country that cooperates with the Association.</p><br/><p>After registering, unless some troubles come up, I should probably make my way towards the Ingrasia Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Without delay, I lined up to the receptionist.</p><br/><p>They seem pretty free at noon, so I quickly got to see somebody.</p><br/><p>\u300cRegistration, please/\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLittle girl, isn\u2019t it a bit too soon for you?\u300d</p><br/><p>The receptionist lady softly rebuked my request.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s to be expected, considering my appearance. It\u2019s still a pain, though.</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t mind, there\u2019s no problem.\u300d</p><br/><p>After I said so the receptionist lady reluctantly handed me the registration form.</p><br/><p>I filled in the form she gave me.</p><br/><p>Name, age, specialty, birthplace, and such.</p><br/><p>Seems like I need to fill in only what I know.</p><br/><p>So I only filled in the name and identified myself as a swordsman.</p><br/><p>With that, I finished filling in the form. Next, I would need to decide which guild to join.</p><br/><p>You can join more than one, so it\u2019s not something to fret about.</p><br/><p>I decided on the Subjugation Division.</p><br/><p>\u300cLittle girl, that\u2019s a dangerous one. Are you sure?\u300d</p><br/><p>The worried receptionist said, but I told her not to mind it.</p><br/><p>I wondered if she\u2019d give up, but</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, let\u2019s hold a trial.</p><br/><p>If you leave the city gates, the lowest rank is not F, it\u2019s E.</p><br/><p>So, I can\u2019t recognize you without a trial first.</p><br/><p>What will you do? It\u2019s alright to give up, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Just joining the Freedom Association would make you an F rank. To join Combat Specialized Divisions, however, you would need to be at least E rank, huh?</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, please put me to a test.\u300d</p><br/><p>I decided to accept the trial.</p><br/><p>As long as it\u2019s not a written test, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>The receptionist lady stood up and went inside. Then, she brought a man.</p><br/><p>He\u2019ll probably oversee the test.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are being tested, huh? Whatever. Come at me.\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, and had us move to another building.</p><br/><p>The bored adventurers who saw this began to murmur among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi oi, that small child isn\u2019t planning on testing, right?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s too ridiculous!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWanna bet on whether she passes or not?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStop it, the outcome is clear!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, she did have a strange sword on her hip. Never seen one like that before!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeemed pretty skillful too\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>They whispered to each other.</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s little to kill time with, they probably jump on the opportunity to discuss these kinds of things.</p><br/><p>In the end, they wandered after us to observe.</p><br/><p>The test was held in a building as large as a gymnasium.</p><br/><p>The test to move unto the next rank is also held here. You can\u2019t take requests without an appropriate rank, so you can take the test at any time.</p><br/><p>For that purpose, a proctor from every guild is always present.</p><br/><p>But since proctors are sometimes relied upon in times of need, they are mostly hired from among rank A- adventurers retired from military service.</p><br/><p>Similarly, the man in front of me, albeit young, is missing a leg.</p><br/><p>He probably lost it performing his duties and became a proctor instead.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll say this ahead of time. If you pass, you become E rank, and are allowed to subsequently challenge D and C rank, and above.</p><br/><p>However, if you fail, you have to first earn 100 F-points before testing again.</p><br/><p>Do you understand?\u300d</p><br/><p>F-points are obtained from F rank requests.</p><br/><p>Rewards and points differ between different levels of requests. In short, you get rewarded for your skill.</p><br/><p>Doing the same thing over and over, after all, only troubles everybody.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo problem.\u300d</p><br/><p>I answered, and the proctor nodded in return.</p><br/><p>And, pointing at the ground,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe test will be conducted within a magic circle. Enter it. After you finish your preparations, we begin.\u300d</p><br/><p>Where he pointed lay a twenty meter in diameter magic circle.</p><br/><p>I entered it. At the same time, a dome like barrier was erected.</p><br/><p>Some people were excitedly looking this way.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m ready!\u300d</p><br/><p>I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright. In that case, defeat the opponent before you!\u300d</p><br/><p>The proctor said, and poured magic into the circle.</p><br/><p>Summoning magic.</p><br/><p>And a single hound appeared before me.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s often used to practice. But, that\u2019s all there is to it.</p><br/><p>Faster than the dog could growl, and maybe even faster than it could show fear of me.</p><br/><p>I decapitated it in a single slash.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo. Defeated, next one please!\u300d</p><br/><p>I was welcomed by silence.</p><br/><p>\u300cA-amazing\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I heard that whisper.</p><br/><p>The proctor for the first time showed confusion.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2026 weren\u2019t a beginner?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I never said I was, did I? In any case, I want to quickly become A ranked!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry, you can only test up to B here; B+ rank and above are conducted at the headquarters only.</p><br/><p>So, what now? Will you test up to B?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so\u2026 Got it! In that case, I\u2019ll go up to B, please.\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a pain, so let\u2019s get it over with.</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019m heading there anyways, I might as well take every test up until then.</p><br/><p>Nodding at my words, and after having regained his composure, the proctor summons the next opponent.</p><br/><p>D \u2192 Hound Wolf</p><br/><p>C \u2192 Giant Bear</p><br/><p>C+ \u2192 Giant Bat</p><br/><p>I\u2019m smoothly cutting through every foe he summons.</p><br/><p>The audience is now silent, observing my fight. Chances are, they are simply glued to the scene before them.</p><br/><p>In any case, I\u2019ve been able to cut down my opponents with a single slash thus far.</p><br/><p>I laughed when a giant bat appeared. How many years has it been since it first attacked me!</p><br/><p>And after defeating it, I was already up to rank C+.</p><br/><p>The next one is rank B.</p><br/><p>\u300cSuperb. To think you were so skilled\u2026</p><br/><p>B rank monster is strong. Are you ready?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo problem. Please send it in!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus, the last enemy was summoned.</p><br/><p>A demon with four wriggling arms. Named: Lesser Demon.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a demon race. I kind of want to eat it and obtain its abilities.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat monster is a lesser demon! Physical attacks won\u2019t work against it.</p><br/><p>Now, what will you do? You should give up now! Wounds from this thing might just kill you!\u300d</p><br/><p>The proctor exclaimed, somewhat excited.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s probably just bitter that I\u2019ve defeated all the enemies so easily up until now.</p><br/><p>But what should I do? I don\u2019t really want to show my skills or magic.</p><br/><p>While I was pondering this, the lesser demon\u2019s eyes flashed red, and he started chanting magic.</p><br/><p>Then, he fired four fire balls at me. As expected of a B rank monster. Truly amazing.</p><br/><p>I easily dodge the attack, feeling them gaudily explode against the barrier behind me.</p><br/><p>However, did the three idiots really defeat this thing alone?</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, isn\u2019t a lesser demon something you challenge with a team?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. I was just thinking that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, hey. Defeating that alone is impossible. That\u2019s like a rank B+ test!\u300d</p><br/><p>I heard such exclamations.</p><br/><p>If I look closely at the proctor, his eyes are bloodshot.</p><br/><p>Hmph. I guess some hazing is to be expected. Whatever.</p><br/><p>Physical attacks aren\u2019t really effective. It\u2019s only half corporeal, after all. A demon race, it seems, is an ethereal being that possesses intelligence and obtains a body.</p><br/><p>The lesser demon was annoyed at the fact that I kept dodging its attacks, so it came at me with its four arms.</p><br/><p>I could simply eat it.</p><br/><p>I have no choice, let\u2019s envelop the sword with magic. A magic sword.</p><br/><p>Like I always do, I bring out a bit of my aura; and, I carefully infuse some into the sword as if not to be revealed as a monster.</p><br/><p>Now, all I need is to slash at it.</p><br/><p>The lesser demon was cut in half by my sword, turned into rubbish, and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo. The end? Is that good enough for B rank?\u300d</p><br/><p>The audience was silent for a moment, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing~!!! Girl, you\u2019re so cool!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTake your mask off and show us your face for a second!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou perverts! Don\u2019t mind them and form a party with us!\u300d</p><br/><p>And other similar grand statements resounded throughout the hall.</p><br/><p>What a ruckus.</p><br/><p>The proctor also seemed to have calmed down or something, saying</p><br/><p>\u300cWonderful! You pass! You pass with flying colors.\u300d</p><br/><p>He shook my hand.</p><br/><p>He probably completely forgot the hazing a moment ago. Not that I care.</p><br/><p>And, ignoring the requests from the audience, I proceeded back into the main building to finish the formalities.</p><br/><p>I was recognized as a B rank adventurer and received the appropriate card.</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru</p><br/><p>Rank: B</p><br/><p>Specialty: Sword</p><br/><p>Division: Subjugation</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what the card reads. It seems they didn\u2019t include the sections I left blank.</p><br/><p>Alright. I can now call myself an adventurer.</p><br/><p>I received the card and said my thanks.</p><br/><p>The receptionist lady now treated me different. Though she previously treated me as a child, she now acted with respect befitting another adult.</p><br/><p>As expected of a professional. She\u2019s quick to rectify her behavior.</p><br/><p>Leaving them behind, I proceeded to impose on Fuze. I had someone lead the way.</p><br/><p>We went through the magic circle, and knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>When I entered, Fuze turned to me and exclaimed,</p><br/><p>\u300cOi oi, you\u2019re standing out too much!</p><br/><p>To cut a lesser demon with a sword\u2026 don\u2019t you know how to hold back!</p><br/><p>A magic sword, right? Even enchanters can\u2019t use that much power, so you\u2019ve done it now!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Did I cause a problem? Actually, if you were looking then you should have stopped it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously\u2026 I didn\u2019t even have the time to\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s fine. Magic swords have been introduced by \u201cWorld Travelers\u201d and are experimental right now.</p><br/><p>So, there\u2019s few people who use one.</p><br/><p>We\u2019re planning to make it our trump card against monsters, so users are selected by invitation only.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll silence the proctor, but be more careful from now on!\u300d</p><br/><p>Infusing magic into a sword \u2013 though you\u2019d expect it to be a common technique \u2013 it\u2019s actually really difficult.</p><br/><p>Well, if there weren\u2019t people watching, I\u2019d just eat it.</p><br/><p>Though I pay it no mind, it seems that I have many high grade skills. So having selected this one on a whim, I stood out too much.</p><br/><p>Not like I\u2019m planning to fight in front of everybody from now on.</p><br/><p>But I should be more mindful from now on.</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks. I\u2019ll be more careful from now on. And, I\u2019m off!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight! Pass my regards to the headquarters. And be careful!\u300d</p><br/><p>After thanking Fuze and picking up my introduction letter, I left the Freedom Association.</p><br/><p>I got a Guild Card as my identification, and earned money for my travel expenses.</p><br/><p>Arranged support for my city, and even formed diplomatic relationships with a country.</p><br/><p>Not bad for a first outing.</p><br/><p>If possible, I would rather not fight against humans. Forming a friendly relationship and cooperating with them from now on would be best.</p><br/><p>And thus ended my stay in Brumund.</p><br/><p>Next on my list is Ingrasia Kingdom\u2019s Royal Capital.</p><br/><p>To meet Freedom Association Headquarter\u2019s Grand Master Kagurazaka Yuuki.</p><br/><p>I thus resumed my journey to meet a fellow world traveler.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

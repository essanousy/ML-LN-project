In the first place, problems always seem to arise whenever you start cooking! It\u2019s almost as if that grill is cursed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow rude! I had this grill prepared for making snacks. It is by no means a haunted item!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Zaza. Master\u2019s grill is a normal grill. But then again, saying that could raise a flag!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKahahaha! Don\u2019t say that, Ramiris. What will you do if something really does happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, master. I will be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! You should do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza couldn\u2019t stay angry while these two talked.</p><br/><p>He finally regained his calm and asked the biggest question that was on his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is such a dirty place. How did you even\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza said that much before suddenly freezing.</p><br/><p>He had been so angry that it had escaped him at first, but he now realized that the sight before him was incredibly strange.</p><br/><p>After separating with Michelle, they had gone down an underground passage that led to the surface.</p><br/><p>This was so they could head to a different hideout that Michelle had prepared for them.</p><br/><p>As they were nearly one thousand people in all, progress was slow.</p><br/><p>And the journey would have been hard even without factoring that in.</p><br/><p>This was because they had to gather protective suits that were left at different bases along the underground passage, and everyone had to wear them.</p><br/><p>They were like astronaut suits in structure, and supplied the wearer with enough nutrition and water to survive for a week without taking them off.</p><br/><p>But while there was some mechanical aid, the suit was still heavy and a burden on the wearer.</p><br/><p>It was one thing for adults to wear them, but it was very hard for children.</p><br/><p>After some time, there were some people who started to get sick, and so it had become necessary to stop and rest\u2026</p><br/><p>You couldn\u2019t even eat with the suits on.</p><br/><p>While they did offer nutrition, that just meant drinking liquid food from a straw.</p><br/><p>You could not eat the meat that Veldora was cooking unless you removed the suit.</p><br/><p>And this was the surface.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was polluted by radiation and toxic gases.</p><br/><p>Taking the suits off here was the same thing as comitting suicide. Only a crazy person would start cooking meat here.</p><br/><p>And yet\u2026</p><br/><p>Right in front of Zaza\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Children were happily eating cooked meat and vegetables.</p><br/><p>(What the hell is happening?)</p><br/><p>Zaza could only watch in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile it may be hard to believe, Zaza. This area here isn\u2019t polluted for some reason\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman, who was also part of the rear guard and also very surprised, said as he reported the substance analysis results.</p><br/><p>In surprise, Zaza asked Rindo, the captain of the advance team.</p><br/><p>\u201cRi-Rindo! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this. It really tastes amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot! That\u2019s not what I was asking!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Mister Zaza. I am only joking. Well, Mister Veldora suddenly said, \u2018If we\u2019re going to have a picnic, let\u2019s make it a barbecue! The weathers great for it!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was him after all?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But I thought it was odd that he would say that about the weather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, Zaza realized that it was oddly bright around where they were.</p><br/><p>As his vision was seen through mechanical eyes, it had taken him a while to notice it.</p><br/><p>But in fact, the place was filled with a light he had not seen in years. In other words, it was sunlight that shone down on them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Can it be\u2026the sun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza looked up in surprise.</p><br/><p>There was a light that shone so bright that it was blinding.</p><br/><p>It was the sun.</p><br/><p>The sun should have been covered by thick clouds, but now it was showing its face.</p><br/><p>The truth was that Veldora had used his power to blow away the clouds and purify the atmosphere in this area.</p><br/><p>After that, he had used \u2018Probability Manipulation\u2019 to adjust things so that more pollutants wouldn\u2019t fly towards them.</p><br/><p>It was an incredible thing to do so casually, but only Ramiris and Beretta knew of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. The sun!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe environment here is not normal\u2026and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza was stunned.</p><br/><p>However, Rindo spoke to him calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in thinking about it. According to Mister Veldora, \u2018We\u2019re lucky. Such a thing can happen with enough amazing \u2018probabilities\u2019 overlapping!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>He had said it with a smile.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s ridiculous!!)</p><br/><p>Zaza screamed inwardly.</p><br/><p>However, the reality was that this place was safe, and everyone had taken their suits off and were enjoying the barbecue.</p><br/><p>As Rindo said, it was stupid to worry so much about it.</p><br/><p>And so Zaza returned to Veldora.</p><br/><p>With no purpose in particular, he sat down on a rock and watched Veldora work.</p><br/><p>He looked so happy as he cooked the meat\u2013which had unknown origins\u2014on his trusty grill.</p><br/><p>Karman came to down to sit next to Zaza and then offered him one of his cigars.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Zaza, I\u2019ve been thinking. That guy is probably a lot greater than we\u2019ve assumed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye. I think so too. I don\u2019t want to admit it, but his boundless cheerfulness has saved us. However, it pains me to see things that way. After all, he\u2019s also quite the troublemaker\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Even when General Michelle came, he started frying pancakes on his grill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? And this meat. Where did he get it from? The more I think about him, the more mysterious he seems. I don\u2019t even know how to talk to him anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. But he doesn\u2019t seem like a bad fellow. However, uh, \u2018flags\u2019, was it? I would not be surprised if something happens again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey-hey, stop that Karman. Everyone\u2019s out here without their suits on. We wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with any trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just as Zaza had finished saying this.</p><br/><p>Karman\u2019s expression froze on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey-hey, stop it. Do you think this is funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza laughed as he slapped Karman on the shoulder. Then he followed his eyes\u2013and saw it.</p><br/><p>That thing that should have been in the world of the underground.</p><br/><p>The thing with paranormal abilities, mankind\u2019s enemy.</p><br/><p>It was called\u2014the Super Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you this would happen!! That grill is cursed!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza\u2019s scream thundered.</p><br/><p>And with that, the sudden arrival of the beast turned the scene into one of chaos and fear.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

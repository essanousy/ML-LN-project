It seemed to be a lump of power that merely existed.</p><br/><p>It broke and scattered when I hit it because it was uninteresting.</p><br/><p>It was a bit interesting, I remember having thought that.</p><br/><p>After that, for a quite while, I spent my daily life searching for the drifting existences similar to me and destroyed them one by one.</p><br/><p>The spectacle was clear to see as if it was daytime, despite the fact that light didn\u2019t shine inside the darkness.</p><br/><p>I got used to such world, besides there was nothing else I could do, and so I kept doing the same thing every day.</p><br/><p>Then a change came upon such a life.</p><br/><p>I met a strange fellow.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, brother. Don\u2019t be so rough. Rampaging too much is boring too, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>That fellow was different from the fellows without Will, he could speak in words.</p><br/><p>I was surprised, and stared at that fellow without saying anything.</p><br/><p>Words, well they weren\u2019t actually words, it could be understood to be Telepathy (Thought Communication)[1].</p><br/><p>However, I didn\u2019t even know that there was a person with Will at that time.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be helped that I was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, hey, what\u2019s with that surprised face? Were you worked too hard by an unpleasant guy in the Surface?[2]</p><br/><p>If it was a disgusting Summoner, it\u2019s okay to beat him to death you know.</p><br/><p>Or else, was the opponent too strong? If so, it can\u2019t be helped. Just give up.\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying such things, the fellow giggled.</p><br/><p>A cheerful fellow.</p><br/><p>After that, I learned various things from that fellow.</p><br/><p>This world was the Underworld.</p><br/><p>In other words, this world could also be called Hell.</p><br/><p>It was the Spiritual World, the home of demons that didn\u2019t possess a physical body.</p><br/><p>I was inside such world.</p><br/><p>I seemed to be a Lesser Demon.</p><br/><p>Demons are an existence like spirits or angels. It seemed to be an existence that received power receives from the spirit of Darkness, and specialized in the demonic attribute.</p><br/><p>Similarly, the Angel specialized in the holy attribute of the spirit of Light, the exception to this seemed to be called a Spirit.</p><br/><p>To me, it was an unimportant story.</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t have personal names.</p><br/><p>There seemed to be few people with names, even amongst the high-rank existences.</p><br/><p>However, I wasn\u2019t troubled.</p><br/><p>Because I could think, I could understand whether my consciousness was suited for it or not.</p><br/><p>But because there was no name, there seemed to be little attachment towards oneself.</p><br/><p>There were some exceptions, if we were summoned several times to the surface, we could become an existence that possessed an ego after having contact with the world.</p><br/><p>Summoning.</p><br/><p>It means to be summoned to the material world from the spiritual world.</p><br/><p>By obtaining a temporary body, the pleasures of the surface could be tasted.</p><br/><p>That is smell, touch and taste.</p><br/><p>I could collect enough information to control the world.</p><br/><p>A summoned demon without an ego seems to be affected by the personality of the Summoning master.</p><br/><p>Various kind of information is received from the summoner\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>According to the contents of the request, it seemed that I could obtain a lump of information called \u201cSoul\u201d.*</p><br/><p>We could evolve into higher beings if we collected a lot of \u201cSouls\u201d.</p><br/><p>Summoning is choosing one appropriate amongst many demons.</p><br/><p>The place was close by, and a demon with the appropriate rank for the quest seems to be chosen naturally.</p><br/><p>It seems we obtain considerable information once we are summoned.</p><br/><p>First of all, an ego arises.</p><br/><p>And we can get great power by being summoned many times.</p><br/><p>That demon come and said to me,</p><br/><p>\u300cHehehe, I\u2019ve been summoned thrice you know? How many times have you been summoned, brother?\u300d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what was funny, but I heard it laugh frivolously.</p><br/><p>Somehow, I was very angry.</p><br/><p>I hit that fellow.</p><br/><p>\u300cBrother, what are you doing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>That fellow hit me back in anger, and after that we fought continuously and exchanged blows for a few days.</p><br/><p>Well rather than hitting each other with our fist, we were throwing energy at each other and making the other party accumulate damage.</p><br/><p>In my mind, hitting is an appropriate expression.</p><br/><p>In the end, there was no conclusion.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, brother. You are strong. I will call you Aniki from today.\u300d</p><br/><p>Because that fellow understood, the fight ended.</p><br/><p>Well rather than a fight, it was my one-sided burst of anger.</p><br/><p>I wanted to go to the Surface too.</p><br/><p>At that time I felt the desire increase intensely.</p><br/><p>From that moment, the two of us became like brothers, and every day we kept picking fights with the other people.</p><br/><p>A mindless demon is uninteresting.</p><br/><p>Our targets were those that had egos and had experienced being summoned to the Surface multiple times.</p><br/><p>Every day, we did nothing but\u2015\u2015fight\u2015\u2015battling.</p><br/><p>But, there didn\u2019t seem to be someone as unusual as me, there were also some who had come from far away to pick a fight with me.</p><br/><p>And before I realized it, my companions had reached 100 and this area of the world became my turf. </p><br/><p>Without becoming aware of it, I had evolved into a Greater Demon.</p><br/><p>I noticed this when I instantly killed my opponent in a fight.</p><br/><p>I felt that a great power, different from the one I had before, ran throughout my entire body.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m invincible.</p><br/><p>So, I got too cocky that time.</p><br/><p>I, who had evolved, acquired a Unique Skill\u300eIntegrator[3]\u300f.</p><br/><p>In conjunction with its progenitor\u2014that I had since my birth\u2014the Unique Skill\u300eDivider[4]\u300f, it was a skill with great utility</p><br/><p>When I hit something, it broke into pieces. This seemed to be the result of the power of division.</p><br/><p>I thought that perhaps this ability was produced due to the trauma of being pierced and cut down in my previous life.</p><br/><p>Well, it was an insignificant issue.</p><br/><p>If the opponent was not my equal, then they could not oppose my power.</p><br/><p>Besides, it was easy to increase the number of underlings since it was possible for me to assimilate the opponent and then divide them.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be helped that I got cocky, right?</p><br/><p>And then, that guy appeared.</p><br/><p>Since being in this world, I felt fear for the first time.</p><br/><p>The existence of a genuinely strong being was carved into my soul.</p><br/><p>A demon with red hair.</p><br/><p>He appeared before us, and easily swept us away like we were just insects.</p><br/><p>My followers and I were exterminated.</p><br/><p>\u300cFumu. There\u2019s no resistance. Boring\u300d</p><br/><p>Along with fear, I felt hatred gushing forth from the depths of my heart.</p><br/><p>My subordinates, my companions were\u2026!</p><br/><p>Amidst the anger, an ability awakened inside me.</p><br/><p>\u300aConfirmed. Acquisition of Unique Skill\u300eRegenerator[5]\u300f\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbSucceeded.\u300b</p><br/><p>Further than division and integration.</p><br/><p>I experienced my astral body (spirit body) regenerating in an instant.</p><br/><p>Die!</p><br/><p>I looked down at that red-haired demon and with full with a flood of emotions,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? Do you still alive?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u201cWave of Division\u201d that I fired was quickly dispersed, and my astral body was crushed into pieces.</p><br/><p>Our statuses were too different.</p><br/><p>After that, I regenerated once again and I swore revenge.</p><br/><p>I continued to chase him many times and challenged that demon for a rematch.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. Interesting! There\u2019s still a person with backbone, huh?</p><br/><p>Good.</p><br/><p>My name is Diablo.</p><br/><p>By the name granted by a great master, I will show you a little of my seriousness!\u300d</p><br/><p>End of World (World\u2019s Collapse)</p><br/><p>At that time, I had certainly experienced the end of the world.</p><br/><p>Originally, the likes like me was an \u201cunneeded thing\u201d, I was able to understand that there was no need to use it.</p><br/><p>Ah, the status was too different.</p><br/><p>But I\u2019m not regretting it, I felt a feeling of satisfaction that I had not felt until now together with death...</p><br/><p>But I never met with it.</p><br/><p>When I manifested in the Surface world for the first time, I was summoned by that person, Diablo.</p><br/><p>And in front of me was a monster.</p><br/><p>If you compared it to the knowledge from my previous life, such a tiny being should be called a Slime.</p><br/><p>However, towards that Slime, Diablo-sama, who should be an absolute existence, kneeled.</p><br/><p>The reason was simple.</p><br/><p>Even the foolish I could understand</p><br/><p>That Slime was in a different dimension.</p><br/><p>I could agree with why Diablo-sama praised it as \u201cGod\u201d every day.[6]</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration, it was the unvarnished truth.</p><br/><p>Like me, the people who received baptism from Diablo-sama, kneeled identically.</p><br/><p>I understood that there was a person who was overwhelming superior to me, but I didn\u2019t mind this treatment.</p><br/><p>Before Diablo-sama were people that weren\u2019t any different from me.</p><br/><p>I could agree that it was natural.</p><br/><p>\u300eThese people were once my comrades...</p><br/><p>Because they cried and swore that they wanted to be useful to Rimuru-sama by all means, I thought to allow them accompany me\u300f</p><br/><p>Diablo-sama\u2019s voice resounded in the distance.</p><br/><p>This person, for sure, will become our true master!</p><br/><p>And so simultaneously,</p><br/><p>\u300eWe, are the faithful servants of the Demon Lord Rimuru. We await your instructions!\u300f</p><br/><p>We pledged our loyalty to the \u201cDemon Lord (God)\u201d in front of us.</p><br/><p>And, I even gained great power.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour name is, \u201cVenom\u201d. Well, please work hard\u300d</p><br/><p>Rimuru-sama spoke to me amiably in a carefree one.</p><br/><p>And so I obtained it, a new name.</p><br/><p>My name is Venom.</p><br/><p>The demon who pledged his loyalty to Rimuru-sama.</p><br/><p>I had achieved evolution and received a physical body in this world.</p><br/><p>A new body and also a new power.</p><br/><p>I became an Arc Demon (Superior Demon General), I had evolved into existence with a different class.</p><br/><p>However, I realized one fact, even after obtaining this much power, the current me had yet to reach the feet of Diablo-sama.</p><br/><p>But, I could still grow stronger!</p><br/><p>In the capsule in the rear, my former companions were asleep in their newly obtained bodies.</p><br/><p>People who would become my subordinates.</p><br/><p>I would lead a unit under Diablo-sama\u2019s direct control.</p><br/><p>A female type demon with scarlet hair named Testarossa was appointed as Diablo-sama\u2019s right hand.</p><br/><p>She, who was originally powerful, saw her power increase just like I had.</p><br/><p>The present me could not match her.</p><br/><p>But, there was no need for me to be impatient.</p><br/><p>I could still grow stronger.</p><br/><p>And then, someday I\u2019ll become Diablo-sama\u2019s right hand and offer this world to Rimuru-sama.</p><br/><p>My name is Venom.</p><br/><p>A man who will someday stand next to Diablo-sama!</p><br/><p>After that, Venom greatly increased in power, and was feared as a demon that exhausted and massacred hostile enemies.</p><br/><p>[1] (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d1\u30b7\u30fc) Shinen Tsuuwa (Terepashii).</p><br/><p>[2] Btw Surface refers to the world where Rimuru and others are living in.</p><br/><p>[3] Tougousha, the one who integrate things.

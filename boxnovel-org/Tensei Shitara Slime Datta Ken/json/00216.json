However, when the fight between the two was observed with Ultimate Skill\u300eLustful Lord Asmosdeus\u300f, the situation shows a different outlook.</p><br/><p>Against Grasword who\u2019s a mass of energy, Albert was distributing energy into every important point of his body.</p><br/><p>The decrease of their vitality was insignificant, but the difference in the aggregate amount gave hint of the outcome of the battle.</p><br/><p>In other words, before Albert finished to cut down Grasword, the outcome will be decided.</p><br/><p>Albert\u2019s defeat, that was the situation would be.</p><br/><p>However, no one could criticize Albert. Rather, with his wonderful skill, he was fighting evenly against the sword king.</p><br/><p>If the difference of the energy was not taken into consideration and only the sword techniques matters, it can be said that Alberto\u2019s superior.</p><br/><p>However, even so, the situation didn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>The way things are going right now, Albert\u2019s defeat was just a matter of time.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the battle between Adalman and Fenn also growing intense.</p><br/><p>The young man with black hair who wears the jet black colored priest clothes against the skinny, small giant who wielding Gleipnir.</p><br/><p>Adalman had possessed and combined with the Death Dragon Wenti, and his energy has increased greatly.</p><br/><p>However, even so, the difference was obvious as Fenn who is in front of Adalman can rival a True Dragon.</p><br/><p>For Ruminas who can see vitality in numerical form, the differences were despair inducing.</p><br/><p>Against Fenn who\u2019s called both the Fighting God and Fist God, for Adalman to be able to survive this far was a miracle.</p><br/><p>In the flurry of throwing, punching, and joint locks, it was obvious that physical strike was the main constituent.</p><br/><p>Joint locks were meaningless, since for a spiritual life form, physical damage would completely recovered in an instant.</p><br/><p>He just barely able to modify the technique to perform a throwing technique to deal and blow away the opponent. However, in the end, that technique was for defending, Adalman couldn\u2019t expect Fenn to be damaged by the throw.</p><br/><p>In other words, he just stalling for time.</p><br/><p>After Adalman understands his own disadvantage, he was fighting with the objective of exhausting the enemy by a long period of combat and not aiming for victory.</p><br/><p>However even so, he was concentrating so hard like he was treading on thin ice.</p><br/><p>In Ruminas\u2019 sight, she could see Adalman\u2019s appearance who ward off Fenn\u2019s attack by casting away all of his defense and manipulated his energy to concentrated on a point.</p><br/><p>In order to cover the difference of the energy density, Adalman was fighting by concentrating all of his power on one point.</p><br/><p>It was already such ability that could be called as a miracle.</p><br/><p>However, it won\u2019t continue more longer, Ruminas thought that it wouldn\u2019t take a long time for Adalman to lose.</p><br/><p>And then, Shion.</p><br/><p>The woman who fighting against Dagruel and standing up many times in front of him.</p><br/><p>Her appearance reminded Ruminas of the Hero Chloe who saved her in the past.</p><br/><p>Blood flows out from her head without any sign of stopping. Even the wound in her whole body, bore new wounds after recovering.</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s attack couldn\u2019t touch Dagruel, she was mortally injured due to Dagruel\u2019s counterattack.</p><br/><p>Even so, Shion stood up, she kept challenging Dagruel over and over.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Nee-san! Please stop it already!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShion-sama! You can\u2019t win against our pops\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt, it\u2019s dangerous. As it is right now, Shion-sama will\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Even Dagruel\u2019s sons were flustered at first.</p><br/><p>However, would they broke through their hesitation mid-battle and,</p><br/><p>\u300cUooooooooo! Pops!! We will be your opponents!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no other way. I\u2019m prepared for it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll do it! And then, I\u2019ll get praised!\u300d</p><br/><p>Exactly as stated in their determination, they went to face Dagruel.</p><br/><p>And right now, they were barely alive bearing serious injury, lying on the ground while being powerless to stand up.</p><br/><p>Those three were strong as majins. That\u2019s why they were alive.</p><br/><p>However, that\u2019s all. In front of Dagruel\u2019s absolute strength, it was all useless.</p><br/><p>(This is impossible right. There\u2019s no reason that we can win. Even I only able to go this far huh\u2015)</p><br/><p>To Ruminas\u2019s ear who reached the stage of resignation partly,</p><br/><p>\u300cPrincess, the preparation for the retreat was complete \u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Such whispered voice was heard.</p><br/><p>The \u201cSeven Celestial Sages\u201d who command the raid seems to have advanced the preparation for a concealed transfer secretly.</p><br/><p>They have judged that there\u2019s no chance for victory in this war and likely to have made their safety a priority.</p><br/><p>Certainly\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, certainly, if she was the Ruminas from before, she would withdrew without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Such thing as going to war with no chance of winning was nonsense.</p><br/><p>The country can be rebuild, it wasn\u2019t something she need to be concerned with.</p><br/><p>Ruminas and her kin has eternal life, there\u2019s no reason for them to fight betting their life on it.</p><br/><p>However \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Will I be really fine? Will it be a correct action for me to withdraw from this place?)</p><br/><p>Ruminas hesitated.</p><br/><p>Shion was barely being able to stand up because Ruminas\u2019 support.</p><br/><p>She used an ability increasing skill, so even a near death serious injury would recover immediately......</p><br/><p>Improving Shion\u2019s regeneration power to the utmost limit was also one of Ruminas\u2019 ability.</p><br/><p>If Ruminas withdrew now, it meant Shion would die immediately.</p><br/><p>(Abandoning the front and running away alone by myself? Such a thing, such an ungraceful action, I\u2019ll never accept it!</p><br/><p>I\u2019m the proud \u201cQueen of Nightmare\u201d, you know!!)</p><br/><p>And so, Ruminas steeled herself.</p><br/><p>\u300cI won\u2019t. I won\u2019t retreat. If by any chance I get killed here, go select the next master from the seven lords.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m one of the proud Octagram.</p><br/><p>Such thing as running away ungracefully is not fitting for me. Don\u2019t you think so?\u300d</p><br/><p>She said so and sprouted a beautiful smile.</p><br/><p>An alluring smile which didn\u2019t suit the face of a young girl.</p><br/><p>The \u201cSeven Celestial Sages\u201d who heard it have their eyes wide opened with surprise instantly.</p><br/><p>Their master who attached so much importance to life, surprised them with such boast.</p><br/><p>However \u2015\u2015at the same time, they were deeply aware.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, it didn\u2019t suit Demon Lord Ruminas Valentine who called as the Queen of the Night to be running away.</p><br/><p>Because she\u2019s the vampire princess who always acted gracefully and reigned nobly.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll not obey such order.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAt the time of your ruin, we\u2019ll also follow.\u300d</p><br/><p>The \u201cSeven Celestial Sages\u201d disobeyed Ruminas\u2019 order for the first time.</p><br/><p>Although she was surprised by it, it wasn\u2019t unpleasant feelings which perplexed Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Far from it, it was instead pleasant feelings.</p><br/><p>\u300cFuu, you fools. Then, strengthen the barrier quickly! Hurry up, you blockheads!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas cheerfully ordered them.</p><br/><p>\u300eAs your will! Then, the city defense will\u2015\u2015\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. Change the barrier\u2019s attribute using the Holy Demonic Inversion technique.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t allow those angels invading the Holy City! As long as we buys some time, Demon Lord Rimuru will send reinforcement!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Princess, do you believe in Demon Lord Rimuru\u2026\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHumph! I don\u2019t believe in him. However\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>There are people who believe in their master while fighting. Don\u2019t you think that the act is worth believing in?\u300d</p><br/><p>As she said so, the \u201cSeven Celestial Sages\u201d shifted their focus on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>How the Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s subordinates were fighting couldn't be assessed as just stalling for time.</p><br/><p>In this situation, even they\u2019re betting their life to buy time, despite it practically having no meaning at all.</p><br/><p>It may be reasonable for their own country, but they had devoted their own life in order to defend the territory of an allied country.</p><br/><p>Their action was a strong proof of them believing that their master would never abandon them.</p><br/><p>\u300cIndeed\u2026\u2026 \u2018Believing\u2019\u2015\u2015Such word, we have forgot about it for a long time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, we will start the strategy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMay fortune with you, Princess!\u300d</p><br/><p>Bowing all together, the \u201cSeven Celestial Sages\u201d left.</p><br/><p>\u2018Will it be really alright?\u2019 so Ruminas hesitated.</p><br/><p>But, she didn\u2019t regret.</p><br/><p>In front of her, Shion stood up once more.</p><br/><p>No matter how she was wounded, she rises up many times.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right, I, I should do the only thing I can do!\u2019 and so, at the moment Ruminas tried to support Shion again\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cGood grief, I have become the opponent because I feel the sign of awakening, but it\u2019s disappointing.</p><br/><p>Or\u2026\u2026 because there\u2019s a person who defends you, you can be at ease?</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, first I\u2019ll deal with your recovery means. That way, you might grow a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>She heard Dagruel\u2019s muttering voice.</p><br/><p>It took a moment for her to realize the meaning of it.</p><br/><p>\u300cSt, stop it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion shouted in panic, but she received Dagruel\u2019s blow and became silent.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t seem to be dead, but it was very unlikely for her to move.</p><br/><p>Glancing at her, Dagruel turned around and began to walk towards Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Ruminas prepared herself.</p><br/><p>\u300cVery well, Dagruel. I shall become your next opponent!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ruminas put herself on guard towards Dagruel.</p><br/><p>The words she said for herself, she felt funny in her mind.</p><br/><p>Far from being an opponent, to Dagruel someone like Ruminas was equal to garbage, so she thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cFumu. As expected, Ruminas. The pride of a Demon Lord is not just for show heh.\u300d</p><br/><p>To Dagruel\u2019s words, she laughed thinly.</p><br/><p>Such thing as pride, she didn\u2019t think about it at all. However, Ruminas just thought that she didn\u2019t want to betray Shion.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s strange. Unlike with Chloe, I haven\u2019t associate with her for a long time.</p><br/><p>Fighting against Dagruel even though there\u2019s no chance for me to win.</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t I run away?</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Did I also believe? That someone would come to help.</p><br/><p>Such thing, such convenient thing, would not happen.)</p><br/><p>She pondered and understood.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the image of that selfish and carefree black dragon crossed in her mind.</p><br/><p>A smile floats naturally on her mouth.</p><br/><p>Her appearance make Dagruel felt strange, but he ignored it without saying anything \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, HERE I GO!\u300d</p><br/><p>At the same time as him shouting, his fist was thrust out towards Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Her soul was frozen in fear. However, Ruminas didn\u2019t run away.</p><br/><p>Evasion was impossible.</p><br/><p>Recognized that, Ruminas mocked herself.</p><br/><p>(\u2015\u2015it\u2019s so different. Struggling till the end. I\u2019m like a different person\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>But, there was no dissatisfaction, instead, she puffed her chest proudly.</p><br/><p>At least at the end she has her pride as a Demon Lord, and she can boast as she challenged a strong person without running away.</p><br/><p>At least, in her final moments, with her hand, that hateful arrogant evil dragon\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Ruminas\u2019 mind then stopped for a moment.</p><br/><p>It occurred immediately before Dagruel\u2019s fist reached Ruminas.</p><br/><p>The time had stopped because of Velzard.</p><br/><p>Right now, currently.</p><br/><p>Something happened before Dagruel\u2019s fist reach Ruminas.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015The powerful fist in front of her eyes.</p><br/><p>And then, a palm of someone with tanned skin received it.</p><br/><p>Dagruel\u2019s attack which had an overwhelming power was obstructed by a man who suddenly appeared in front of Ruminas.</p><br/><p>Then,</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahaha! I, have arrived[1]!\u300d</p><br/><p>While laughing loudly, the man shouted in loud voice.</p><br/><p>However, time was currently stopped, the man\u2019s voice didn\u2019t reach anyone.</p><br/><p>With the exception of Dagruel.</p><br/><p>No, it reached Ruminas actually.</p><br/><p>(Did he come here!!?)</p><br/><p>However, Ruminas was conscious but her body can\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>In such confusing situation, Veldora\u2019s voice reached Ruminas\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(What\u2019s this, I can\u2019t speak!? Has time stopped......? But who did it?)</p><br/><p>She was flustered because she shouted instinctively, but Ruminas noticed that she couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>And so, trying to grasp the situation, finally she realized that currently the world\u2019s movement had stopped.</p><br/><p>(What a carefree guy! Even when the world stopped, for him to be able to move like it\u2019s natural\u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>It was surprising as Ruminas continuously thought.</p><br/><p>At the same time, it became very ridiculous. The tension that strained her before death had loosened, she felt a sense of relief filled her heart for some reason.</p><br/><p>(Impossible. For me to feel relieved just because Veldora have came\u2015\u2015that can\u2019t be possible!)</p><br/><p>She threw away such feelings which crossed in her mind and focus on the current situation.</p><br/><p>There was no light, she couldn\u2019t understand anything inside the stopped world.</p><br/><p>However, Ruminas\u2019 super perception began to perceive the situation faintly.</p><br/><p>Only Veldora and Dagruel who calmly moving.</p><br/><p>She listened carefully to the conversation of those two,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2026. the\u2026!? Even though I have make my entrance coolly with a lot of trouble\u2026.. for the world to be stopped?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s Veldora. It was a miraculous timing, but you have my condolences.</p><br/><p>Even though I said that, I\u2019m not the one who do it, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnuuu, I know. The one who can do thing like this is probably my aneue[2].</p><br/><p>As for the length, enough to stop time for two seconds, that person has the useless habit of stopping time for a long time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, there\u2019s no meaning to stop time for a long time. If there\u2019s someone else who can move inside the stopped world, stopping time doesn\u2019t have any meaning.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. I have advised her several times, but she doesn\u2019t listen to me. Oh well, it\u2019s fine as I don\u2019t really care anyway. She messed around such as stopping time when it was punishment time\u2026\u2026 oh well, forget it.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s another thing to discus\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, what?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu. To match the timing when the time moving again, I want to redo my arrival.</p><br/><p>So, as I decided to be cool, it\u2019s necessary to make Ruminas impressed you know\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026can I hear the reason?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKuahahahaha! What, it\u2019s simple y\u2019know. I till now have done various thing</p><br/><p>Therefore, Ruminas considerably resents me.</p><br/><p>If I make her indebted to me while displaying how cool I\u2019m, she would forget everything, that\u2019s the plan.</p><br/><p>Kukukuku. For that reason, I was hiding myself from sight.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know when you might go berserk so I was a bit worried here.</p><br/><p>Yet\u2026..</p><br/><p>Even though I had made my entry so cool with a lot of trouble, it was ruined because of my aneue.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the reason. Can I ask you for that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2018Haa\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u2019, Ruminas seemed to hear Dagruel\u2019s tired sigh.</p><br/><p>And then, Ruminas also felt the same.</p><br/><p>(This rotten lizard, I\u2019ll strangle him later!)</p><br/><p>Ruminas raged with her face turning red.</p><br/><p>If she could move now, she\u2019d gifted him a kick without a doubt.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps, I\u2019d be able to move because of anger?\u2019 Thinking so, she hated Veldora\u2019s attitude.</p><br/><p>Veldora didn\u2019t think that Ruminas can hear him in the stopped world, she deemed it to be his carelessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach him a lesson without fail later!\u201d Ruminas sworn so in her mind.</p><br/><p>At the time when Dagruel about to answer Veldora\u2019s offer, there was a person who tried to stand up with a staggering movement.</p><br/><p>It was Shion.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were bloodshot, the open wounds on her whole body haven\u2019t recovered.</p><br/><p>However, it was strange that no blood flowing out.</p><br/><p>While cladding in a strange atmosphere, Shion completely stood up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hm?\u2019 so Dagruel gazed at her,</p><br/><p>\u300cShion, huh. You were able to move even in the stopped world\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>Hm,\u300eEnvy\u300fseems to have disappear. This is, I see\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora noticed something and stopped talking.</p><br/><p>Then as if to interrupted his word,</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Ve, Veldora-sama\u2026.. th, that person\u2026 is my prey. Wo, would you hand over him to me?\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion asked Veldora while panting, using her sword as a cane to stand.</p><br/><p>Veldora looked at her while squinting his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, very well. I will lend you a bit of my power. Fight well to your heart\u2019s content,!\u300d</p><br/><p>He responded so.</p><br/><p>\u300cTh, thank you very much\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Shion seemed ready to fall, so Veldora supported her.</p><br/><p>And, from where Veldora touched Shion, his energy flowed.</p><br/><p>\u300cHu! Although I had said that I would lend it to you, there is no fragment of restraint from you eh. (Perhaps, I should collect it later from Rimuru \u2026\u2026)\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora grumbled, looking worn out while Shion\u2019s complexion improved fast.</p><br/><p>The wounds on her body healed, even her clothes, before anyone aware, had become as good as new.</p><br/><p>Dagruel raised one of his brow tolerating it, standing silently waiting for Shion\u2019s preparation to complete.</p><br/><p>Then\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300aIndividual: Shion undergo ability evolution, Ultimate Skill\u300eTyrannous Lord Susanoo\u300fwas acquired.\u300b</p><br/><p>Unchanged by even the stopped world, \u201cThe Voice of the World\u201d was heard.</p><br/><p>It was the moment when Shion had awoken ultimate power.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have kept you waiting. However, as you hoped for, I shall give you some amusement.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFumu. Well then, I shall accept your offer.\u300d</p><br/><p>The two nod to the other gladly and once again confront each other.</p><br/><p>In the stopped world where it was difficult to perceive the opponent\u2019s presence, the fight between Shion and Dagruel begun.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(By any chance, is my turn only\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Veldora was anxious about such thing, there was no one who noticed it.</p><br/><p>[1] Momotaros\u2019 reference.

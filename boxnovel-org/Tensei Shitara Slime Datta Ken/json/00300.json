I think it will be a waste on the west side. I will take care of you, Soway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really. This is because the information department has missed the correct information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKhuhkhovh. I think it is not good in some ways that I was not good at economics, but the information was not important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yes. Even if we overlooked, we would have noticed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. So there is no problem. Rather, we should see now that there is a reason to move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether it was Diablo or Soway, I thought that it would not be a problem if I could not reach the black screen here.</p><br/><p>It was because he thought that it would be possible to see a black screen by himself if he could narrow down to an unnatural gold movement and narrow down to a specific individual or group.</p><br/><p>The first order from Limle is to remove the corruption of the school.</p><br/><p>If so, it would be good to investigate the existence of corruption in each school and remove any corruption if it is.</p><br/><p>Luckily, it has been concluded that corruption at Tempest Human Resources Development Academy has not been confirmed, and the awarding of fraudulent money is none.</p><br/><p>It is natural.</p><br/><p>If it seems that cheating could be confirmed in Templ\u00e9, which is Limle\u2019s knee, it would have been a big problem that could not be done in terms of scandals.</p><br/><p>As a result of the survey, Inglacia General School has only been found to be corruption of some aristocratic teachers.</p><br/><p>The degree of corruption was very slight, and to some extent it was self-cleaning and at a very reasonable level.</p><br/><p>Since the list of the aristocratic teachers who had received the funding has been completed, Soway\u2019s \u201cpart of the body\u201d was to capture it and follow the connection on that.</p><br/><p>Use all means, force, power, money, people, things and everything to drive down the enemy.</p><br/><p>That is exactlyEconomic warMoney gameIt was not an exaggeration to say that.</p><br/><p>But maybe \u2026</p><br/><p>Diablo thought that the source of the money was not from the western countries.</p><br/><p>Gold is from the eastern empire-that is also not from the former emperor remnants, that was what Diablo expected.</p><br/><p>A report has been received to support the forecast.</p><br/><p>That morning he was informed by Moss that the situation had suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>All the students are safe, but some of them gave up and left the \u201chumanity liberation alliance\u201d.</p><br/><p>Also, after trying to kill teachers and potential students who are likely to get in the way \u2026</p><br/><p>Once the situation has been put in place, it is already decisive.</p><br/><p>In the unlikely event that Soway\u2019s subordinates decided to continue their investigation in the western countries.</p><br/><p>Complete the procedure and prepare a ticket for the flight vessel for two people.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Diablo and Soway headed for the Nazca, Namrium, Ulmeria and the Eastern Union Unification Empire here.</p><br/><p>\u25c7 \u25c7 \u25c7</p><br/><p>And-</p><br/><p>The sixth day from Limle escape.</p><br/><p>Diablo was alone, and was aboard the NNU Magic Science Academy.</p><br/><p>Soway dispatches \u201ca part of the body\u201d in the vast empire territory and gathers up the information.</p><br/><p>Although I had obtained considerable information in the past two days, this was my first contact with the most important NNU Magic Science Academy.</p><br/><p>Soyway, who was unwilling to see Diablo alone, finally listened to Diablo\u2019s case.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever runaway?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhwkhoff, you are persistent Soway-\u201c</p><br/><p>Although there was an exchange, Diablo got a good job in this way.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s plain but it sits on a comfortable sofa and eats elegant tea.</p><br/><p>As we came on the first flight ship in the morning, the time was still around noon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Diablo-sama, you\u2019ve heard about the rumor.

I, Gordama Silver, let me give up on this school\u201d</p><br/><p>What appeared in front of the relaxing Diablo was a person with a certainty because it looked moderately mature.</p><br/><p>I know that I used to be quite trained in the past, but I can not win the year, and fat is starting to stick to my abdomen.</p><br/><p>However, the light of the eye was sharp, and it was transmitted from the body that energy was shining.</p><br/><p>The cane you hold in your hand is not intended to aid walking, it is a high-quality wand that you use to refine your magic.Magician\u2019s wandMagic rodIt is.</p><br/><p>Apparently seemingly fancy, but in order to identify its essence, the grade isCharacteristic gradeuniquewas.</p><br/><p>In other words, it is a person who has a certain level of financial ability and / or ability.</p><br/><p>(No, I guess I didn\u2019t think I would miss it \u2026)</p><br/><p>Diablo that gets confused without showing an attitude.</p><br/><p>In front of Diablo, I doubted the nerve to hold the weapon.</p><br/><p>To be cautious is not understandable, but having a weapon is to be ready to fight, which means that there is a game that can be won.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to think of being a small person with a sweet idea of \u200b\u200bbeing spoofed and not going through it, but if it is so, it\u2019s a big problem.</p><br/><p>After all, it is because such fools are mixed in the place of human resource development in the three university gardens that are promoted with the help of Limul.</p><br/><p>In the first place, it is outrageous at the time of holding a weapon in front of Diablo \u2026</p><br/><p>It is unusual for Diablo, and I decided to put out the main subject of the story with some patience now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m having a hard time. Mr. Limle was very much looking forward to the growth of the students.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am honored. Where is the service that came today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I have a deaf feeling that there is a tendency to honor nobles on campus.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a beautiful smile, Diablo stares at Gordama and says.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Yes, it was an offer from Inglacia Gakuen. It was proposed with the purpose of letting students in the world learn about the correspondence with nobles. Even if it is our school, that opinion I think there are points to listen to</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website. Stop reading at pirate sites that steals translations.

Well then, if you abuse the three schools equality, will any ideal be transformed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gordama responded with no worries, in front of a glance that even the inner side was visible.</p><br/><p>Diablo who throws it away and throws it away.</p><br/><p>It is true that we received the funding, but it is different from that! It is not even the case that you thought so, such as selling opinions in gold in the first place. Please stop doing this because I thought it was necessary to learn how to respond to nobles, so I agreed that!</p><br/><p>While making her face a little red, Gordama makes excuses while keeping calm.</p><br/><p>It is true that research funding was provided by Inglacian nobility, but the discussions at the three schools were not related, which was Gordama\u2019s case.</p><br/><p>\u201cHM\u201d</p><br/><p>And Diablo asked.</p><br/><p>Even if observed with Diablo\u2019s \u201cmagic eyes\u201d, there is no abnormality in Gordama\u2019s breathing and heart rate.</p><br/><p>Do you really think that way, or do you have another purpose for what you have received?</p><br/><p>Yes, for example-making the nobles of the Inglacian kingdom liable for injustice.</p><br/><p>Diablo has read Soway\u2019s survey data and has already identified that Gordama is not troubled with funding.</p><br/><p>The answer derived from it tells us that the latter reasoning is correct.</p><br/><p>Diablo gives off the last question that there is little information left to talk with Gordama.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more question asking you to listen carefully to the story later. Actually, you are in great trouble \u2014\u201c</p><br/><p>So in advance, Diablo talks about the scenario as he meets with Soway.</p><br/><p>The fictional story that was frequently explained at Tempest Human Resource Development Academy and Inglacia General Academy.</p><br/><p>-The face is a sideshow of the Great Demon King Limuru, the reality is the practice training for the students by unannounced.</p><br/><p>So the safety of the students is protected and there are no worries about it.</p><br/><p>However, this time was different.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already know that this was a contact, but from here it\u2019s production. Actually, we\u2019ve lost contact with them now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Say so and observe Gordama with the \u201cmagic eyes\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow-!? Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gordama comes back as amazed.</p><br/><p>However, contrary to his tone and attitude, Gordama was quite calm.</p><br/><p>(A little upset is none. In other words, did you know.</p><br/><p>It is an act that only ordinary people appear to be upset and upset, but it does not lead to Diablo.</p><br/><p>It is a character who doesn\u2019t move in any way, and a warrior of the former battle who has overcome any shambles.</p><br/><p>Because he was such a man, he made a fatal failure now.</p><br/><p>It would have been nice if I could move freely and just pass it straight.</p><br/><p>Instead of doing that, he showed upset acting, turning Diablo\u2019s suspicion into conviction.</p><br/><p>It can be said that it was the limit of a man named Gordama.</p><br/><p>At this point, Diablo convinced that Gordama was a member of the \u201cHuman Liberation Alliance,\u201d even though he was not a black man.</p><br/><p>\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6</p><br/><p>I thought that Gordama\u2019s failure was to defeat Diablo.</p><br/><p>You can protect yourself with expensive magic items, take Diablo with the skillfully polished pipe and use it as a fake target of the nobles of the Kingdom of Inglacia. become.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not surprised.

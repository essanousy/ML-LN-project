Mister Veldora is on a different level. After all, he could defeat Super Beasts by punching them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only Karman, but his men all agreed.</p><br/><p>There was something more than mere respect in their voice. It was clear that they were all drawn to Veldora and Beretta.</p><br/><p>However, as the person listening to them, Jegyll was not satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible. The Neutrolauncher didn\u2019t work on him? How can you stop neutrons that permeate matter and blast through the atomic nucleus at the speed of light!? And you say he defeated Super Beasts with his fists? Do you take me for a fool?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman could only chuckle at this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much we want to agree with you. But it was us who actually fought and were forced to see these unbelievable things you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll looked at him and muttered. \u2018So it\u2019s true then.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, what technology was used to modify those three?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery. However, considering they were able to modify us overnight, I would imagine it had to be the work of some incredible scientist from the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll listened to Karman\u2019s men talk. And after thinking about it for a moment, she asked her next question.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichelle told me about the fighting style of one called Veldora. But this Beretta sounds quite reliable as well. Was it also this Beretta, who fixed you all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it was him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Interesting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll listened to that much and then bit her lip with a smile.</p><br/><p>There was something evil about the way the corner of her mouth rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it would be troublesome having one person stay here, but it\u2019s turned out to be for the best. This information will prove useful. We\u2019ll catch him later when we have time.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had transformed so naturally that for a moment, Karman could not understand what she was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Jegyll. What are you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman asked hesitantly.</p><br/><p>It was a fatal mistake. That being said, it was already too late the moment that they had put their trust in her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully slow, Karman. I am so thankful for your stupidity. I doubt the cautious Zaza would have fallen into this trap so easily. At least\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Karman finally understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!! All of you. Scatter! And run to the hangar!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman shouted.</p><br/><p>However, it was too late.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026he would not have made such an amateur mistake. You couldn\u2019t know who the traitor was, and yet you trusted me because I was close to Michelle. That\u2019s the height of stupidity. You should have left at least one person in the hangar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman and his men were not wearing their Powered Suits.</p><br/><p>They were currently in the hangar.</p><br/><p>And just then, there was a thunderous explosion.</p><br/><p>The sound of hope dying.</p><br/><p>\u201cJegyll. You. How\u2026 What about Veldora and the others\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. They should have reached the place I had designated by now. These weak resistance soldiers could be crushed whenever we wanted. But an enemy that Michelle was wary of has to be dealt with. And so I have ensured their deaths.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnsured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The Six Tyrant. Have you heard of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You wouldn\u2019t\u2026the most powerful weapon that could destroy cities\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. It\u2019s an old weapon, but its power is proven. It would be a waste not to use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll said with a smile. Karman felt a horrifying chill run up his spine.</p><br/><p>(She\u2019s crazy. A person with an incredibly dangerous way of thinking\u2026)</p><br/><p>He thought. And then he wondered.</p><br/><p>Would Michelle really have been unable to see the madness within her?</p><br/><p>And so Karman could not stop himself shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You! Were you betraying General Michelle from the beginning!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked as he stared at her. Fear and curiosity in his eyes.</p><br/><p>However, Jegyll shook her head in denial.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that is wrong. I was reborn. By the hands of the great, true Emperor Fudora. He turned me into the most powerful warrior\u2013the Bionoid.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said grandly. And then with a speed too fast for him to follow, she slammed him to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cGggaaagh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His cheek had been punched and his stomach kicked. Karman rolled on the ground.</p><br/><p>However, pain that exceeded a fixed level was shut off, and so Karman did not feel as much pain as he expected.</p><br/><p>The real problem was what Jegyll had just said.</p><br/><p>(That means General Michelle was not tricked or betrayed. But the situation is no better for it, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything I can do.)</p><br/><p>While he thought this, Karman also felt that he was stronger than he had expected.</p><br/><p>But without puzzling over this, he quickly found the answer.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s without a doubt due to the modification surgery.)</p><br/><p>Now that he was sure, a sense of gratitude towards Veldora welled up inside of him.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019d be dead now if I hadn\u2019t been modified. Still, this body really is amazing. I can see the amount of damage as numbers\u2026 So that\u2019s 10% to the head, 3% to the stomach. I should probably pretend to be dead here\u2026)</p><br/><p>And so Karman pretended to be in immense pain as he writhed on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You\u2019re still alive then? The Empire\u2019s maintenance work is more impressive than I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman ignored her taunts and connected to his mean through \u2018Telepathy Line.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018All of you. I\u2019m fine. But things are going badly. But I\u2019m going to get out of this alive.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was enough to calm them after the shock they felt over him being attacked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah, you are safe!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018But, what should we do? Apparently, the Powered Suits were destroyed?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The remote controls are not being recognized\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>They quickly and accurately assessed the situation.</p><br/><p>And through the use of Telepathy Line, they quickly decided on the direction to take without Jegyll realizing it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You\u2019ve got another good joke to tell?</p><br/><p>Clown: Yes! A phone rings in a reanimation room: \u201cExcuse me, is John still alive?\u201d. \u201cStill not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oda: Hahaha\u2026</p><br/><p>Clown: For what reason have you called us in today, Doctor?</p><br/><p>Oda: Since you said you\u2019d like to receive further treatment from somebody else, I wanted to talk to you one more time and compile a proper report.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Then what\u2019s holding you? We aren\u2019t getting any younger.</p><br/><p>Oda: Let\u2019s start with an easy question. What is the date?</p><br/><p>Clown: October 5th, 20XX.</p><br/><p>Oda: On what street is this office located?</p><br/><p>Clown: Karasuma-sanjou-agari.</p><br/><p>Oda: What year were you born in?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: \u2026 one second, I\u2019m getting a headache\u2026</p><br/><p>Oda: Focus, please.</p><br/><p>Clown: 1993, I think?</p><br/><p>Oda: How many people are in this room?</p><br/><p>Clown: 3?</p><br/><p>Oda: Name them.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: the Clown, I\u2013Pierrot, and you\u2013doctor Oda.</p><br/><p>Oda: Are those names?</p><br/><p>Clown: What do you mean?</p><br/><p>Oda: Names are composed of a first name and your family name. My name, for example, is Oda Tarou. What is your name?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: \u2026 this headache is killing me\u2026</p><br/><p>Oda: What is your name?</p><br/><p>Clown: Ka\u2026 Clown!</p><br/><p>Oda: Sorry, that question must have been hard, so let\u2019s skip it. I have just one more. What do you wish to do to Miyaguchi Yojiro?</p><br/><p>Clown &amp; Pierrot: Kill him!</p><br/><p>Oda: Security! She is clearly deranged! We must immediately isolate her from the public\u2026</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Life in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>060. A bit sudden, but let\u2019s have a test</p><br/><p>The inside of the classroom was silent.</p><br/><p>So silent, in fact, that you can hear the students swallow saliva.</p><br/><p>Ranga ran up to me while waiving his tail.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, kids, have you been working hard?\u300d</p><br/><p>Though I faced them with a bright smile, they did not return it.</p><br/><p>Of course, if I consider things from their perspective, it makes more sense\u2013they just might think of me as just some bastard to kill.</p><br/><p>However, this world follows the survival of the fittest principle.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only one thing you can hate\u2013your own weakness.</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay! Kids, you seem to have things to say, so let\u2019s have a test!\u300d</p><br/><p>I so declared.</p><br/><p>\u300cWha-! How did it turn into that!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA t-test?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUeee!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>They responded with loud criticism.</p><br/><p>Yep. Tests are hated in just about every world.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, don\u2019t worry! It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t get what you\u2019re saying.</p><br/><p>But listen,</p><br/><p>What will happen from now on is absolutely necessary for you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?! We\u2019ll just kick the bucket sooner or later!</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no point to studying, is there?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cR-right\u2026 all the teachers until now have been bringing us toys or picture books telling us to have fun\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe haven\u2019t studied from the moment we have come here\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2026 want to read\u2026 more picture books\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026..\u300d</p><br/><p>All they do is complain.</p><br/><p>However, they lack yesterday\u2019s \u201cvigor\u201d. Did they tire themselves out picking on Ranga?</p><br/><p>Well, I guess the fact that they even responded to my words is admirable enough.</p><br/><p>But, this is necessary to them. Unfortunately, I cannot compromise on this.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright. I understand your point.</p><br/><p>But, the test (game) that we\u2019ll play from now one will help you kids\u2026 you brats get to vent some anger. It should be fun.</p><br/><p>In a second, you will have a mock battle with me.</p><br/><p>The rules are simple. You can go all out and use anything you want. Should you bring me down, you win.</p><br/><p>If I am still on the run after twenty minutes, I win. Simple?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJust that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. We\u2019ll have the test inside this room. I\u2019ll erect a barrier, so no one can get out.</p><br/><p>Those observing also cannot help.</p><br/><p>Do you understand the rules? If you do, then decide who goes first!\u300d</p><br/><p>A simple mock battle.</p><br/><p>I am not planning on attacking at all. I just want to verify their abilities.</p><br/><p>If they are incapable of acquiring a unique skill, I wouldn\u2019t know of another method to consume the terrible power in their bodies.</p><br/><p>According to my analysis, their magical energy, as compared to monsters, would have them A ranked at least.</p><br/><p>Though adventurers rely on fighting strength to decide their ranks, monsters tend to judge by power alone.</p><br/><p>I was at first surprised to see B rank adventurers whose magical energy is hardly C ranked.</p><br/><p>I only learned of this after having become an adventurer myself.</p><br/><p>Normal monsters do not concern themselves with skill proficiency, so they were usually evaluated based only on raw abilities. Of course, there are plenty of monsters that do hone their skills\u2026</p><br/><p>So generally speaking, these kids are A ranked.</p><br/><p>If they can properly use their abilities, they should be formidable opponents\u2026</p><br/><p>They finally decided the order.</p><br/><p>With an eager face, Misaki Kenya is coming at me.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s just an eight year old troublemaker. Is he the leader of these brats?</p><br/><p>\u300cHey! I can use the sword, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Impudent little\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u300cGo ahead. And brat, when you lose, I\u2019ll have you address me politely from then on!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph! I won\u2019t lose to a lousy adult. I\u2019ve only lost against Shizu-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHeeeeh. How about you leave the self praise for after you win?\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus we were ready for the match.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll have the children keep time. I acquired a sand watch the other day, and showed the kids how to use it.</p><br/><p>Now then, shall we start?</p><br/><p>\u300cB-begin!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kenya moved on Alice\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>He moves well for an elementary school student. Actually, he\u2019s defeated adults before..</p><br/><p>Not that it\u2019ll have any effect on me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cGo for it Ken-chan\u2014!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t lose!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing their encouragement, Kenya redoubled his efforts.</p><br/><p>He desperately tried to land a hit on me, but I avoided them with room to spare\u2013without a need to predict.</p><br/><p>After ten minutes, with tears in his eyes, he started shooting fire at me.</p><br/><p>Hmph. What a pathetic flame that was.</p><br/><p>It would be hard to compare it to the flame I use, so I\u2019ll just say that the flame was really weak.</p><br/><p>An A rank monster, using all his strength to create a fireball, can easily surpass a temperature of 1,000 degrees\u2026</p><br/><p>But this is even weaker than Ellen\u2019s fire ball attack.</p><br/><p>Inferior to magic used by a B rank adventurer.</p><br/><p>He definitely learned it by watching, so this would be poor representation of his real abilities, right?</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, you\u2019re focusing too much on the flame. Try shooting out a ball of pure energy\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up! Shizu-san used this skill, and it was powerful!</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t listen to what the likes of you have to say!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>What an arrogant brat.</p><br/><p>In the end, he ignored my advice, and, when the twentieth minute passed, I was declared the victor.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, that\u2019s enough! Address me properly as sensei from now on!</p><br/><p>Who\u2019s next? Come at me!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Dropping his shoulders, and visibly depressed, Kenya rejoined the kids.</p><br/><p>Well, I\u2019d be in for a shock if I had lost to a brat who hadn\u2019t even turned ten.</p><br/><p>Next one up was Chloe O\u2019Bell.</p><br/><p>An eight year old girl with a rare hair color. It was black with silver mixed, ever seen anything like it?</p><br/><p>Anyways, she was a beautiful girl with an interesting hair color. I wonder if she\u2019s part Japanese?</p><br/><p>She has this Eastern-Western vibe.</p><br/><p>So, shall we begin? If looked from afar, people would see a middle-school kid bullying a little girl.</p><br/><p>Even so, this test is crucial! I\u2019m acting all cool and all, but if I really lose\u2026 what a bad joke that would be.</p><br/><p>\u300cKurocchi, don\u2019t push yourself!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t hurt yourself, Kuro-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>(TL Note: Chloe in Japanese is written Kuroe, hence the nickname Kuro)</p><br/><p>Most of the the kids\u2019 said \u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself!\u201d rather than \u201cDo your best!\u201d</p><br/><p>I guess that\u2019s just how it is.</p><br/><p>The signal was already given, and the match had begun.</p><br/><p>Though there was a five minute intermission, I chose not to take a break. Even so, I was not tired in the slightest.</p><br/><p>All I\u2019ve been doing is dodging, so it was an easy win.</p><br/><p>Now, Chloe, what kind of attack will she show me?</p><br/><p>I wonder if she just likes books, but she\u2019s got one on her right now.</p><br/><p>Is that it? Is she planning on hitting my head with it or throwing it at me?</p><br/><p>Will she suddenly say \u201cThis is not a book, it\u2019s a blunt weapon!\u201d\u2026 Nah, probably not.</p><br/><p>While I was thinking this foolishness.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u201dIn an eternal flowing stream, bind my foe (Water Prison)\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>Uoo! Suddenly, water appeared at my feat. According to\u300eHeat Perception\u300fit\u2019s real water.</p><br/><p>Magic! What an amazing child. Let me a guess, a genius?</p><br/><p>While I was feeling impressed, the water continued to rage and enveloped me in a bubble.</p><br/><p>When I tried poking it, it stretched out a bit.</p><br/><p>I wonder if she is fixated on accelerating this skill\u2013making it something akin to my water blade.</p><br/><p>Wonderful. But, what will she do now?</p><br/><p>\u300cThis magic\u2019s next step is to fill the bubble with water!</p><br/><p>If you accept defeat, I will let you go. If you don\u2019t, you will die!\u300d</p><br/><p>So young but so dreadful!</p><br/><p>Kenya was so much cuter in comparison. But a skill of this level\u2026 yeah\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cYup, that\u2019s some amazing magic. But it won\u2019t have any effect on me.</p><br/><p>But this magic is superior. Make sure to continue practicing later!\u300d</p><br/><p>I said, while stroking her head.</p><br/><p>Prison? That kind of thing is pointless in the face of\u300eCloning\u300f.</p><br/><p>Frankly, that skill is the strongest among extra skills. It\u2019s so amazing that it is nearly a unique skill.</p><br/><p>Besides, to me who has various resistances against temperature attacks, her attack is pointless. And I\u2019ve had that resistance since I was born.</p><br/><p>Chloe sat down in shock. Her face red, with tears falling from her eyes.</p><br/><p>Forgive me, I\u2019m not pulling any punches here. To you brats who looked down on me I have to show an overwhelming difference in strength.</p><br/><p>Chloe lost her will to fight, so I won.</p><br/><p>Chloe was touching the spot on her head that I stroked earlier while smiling for some reason.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s continue!</p><br/><p>The next opponent was Gale Gibson.</p><br/><p>The oldest among them\u20139 years old. Brown hair and a large build with well defined features. Definitely a pretty boy.</p><br/><p>When he grows up, his looks won\u2019t lose even against famous actors!</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s crush him! \u2026 of course I had no such thought.</p><br/><p>I am an adult, so I\u2019ll be a fair opponent.</p><br/><p>Gale, without a trick or tactic in mind, fired a single shot at me.</p><br/><p>After watching the other two\u2019s attempt, he probably reevaluated me a bit.</p><br/><p>He fired a round that would certainly kill any other teacher.</p><br/><p>Without a question, he put every ounce of his power into that shot. That was a good decision.</p><br/><p>But, unfortunately, to a wrong opponent. That kind of attack could never reach me.</p><br/><p>As when it did,\u300eGluttony\u300fabsorbed it.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat was that! That\u2019s cheating!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yes. Yes it is. I completely agree.</p><br/><p>\u300cListen up, adults are cheaters. We\u2019ll win no matter what trick we have to use!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the kind of beings adults are!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thought that might have been a little immature of me to use against a child, it\u2019s not the time to be picking methods.</p><br/><p>I mean, I could have just repelled it, but I felt that there was a chance it would create a hole in the barrier.</p><br/><p>And though I was given free reign over them I shouldn\u2019t go around destroying the classroom.</p><br/><p>So, I chose the method that would prevent any possible casualty.</p><br/><p>In the end, even this was troublesome.</p><br/><p>Gale, embittered by this, gathered energy into his fists and attacked me.</p><br/><p>What a child. At this point, he has no chance of victory.</p><br/><p>He ended up just as Kenya did, and so it was my victory.</p><br/><p>Sekiguchi Ryouta is a timid child.</p><br/><p>Always friendly with Kenya, supporting him from behind.</p><br/><p>Claimed to be the strong Kenya\u2019s partner. There\u2019s no special meaning attached to that, they are just being kids.</p><br/><p>But, as for his power\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cRyouta, avenge me!\u300d</p><br/><p>The moment he heard these words, his eye color changed.</p><br/><p>This ability is similar to Shion\u2019s\u300eBattle Maniac\u300f. His speed and power more than doubled. And, his magic energy and fighting spirit enveloped his body.</p><br/><p>What a wonderful example of battle transformation. The only minus would be the fact that he is unconscious.</p><br/><p>And it\u2019s a great demerit at that\u2013to lose one\u2019s composure in the midst of battle.</p><br/><p>Its effectiveness depends on the opponent. I mean, maybe\u300eBattle Maniac\u300fis a common skill, but against high level opponents it\u2019s not even a gamble.</p><br/><p>You are certain to lose.</p><br/><p>His movements are good, so maybe if his opponent wasn\u2019t me, he could put up a fight.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 too bad!</p><br/><p>I easily evaded him for twenty minutes.</p><br/><p>The last one was the girl Alice Rondo.</p><br/><p>The youngest\u20137 years old. Her hair blond and straight, reaching to her shoulders.</p><br/><p>With a face that could be described to belong to a doll, she is certainly a beauty.</p><br/><p>Unlike the adult-like Chloe, she is, apparently, a tomboy.</p><br/><p>Now, what kind of ability will she show me.</p><br/><p>Alice threw the doll she held in her hands in the air, and</p><br/><p>\u300cGo\u2014 Bear-san!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>She called out.</p><br/><p>Huh? While I was thinking that, a bear suddenly started attacking me.</p><br/><p>And its attacks were pretty strong.</p><br/><p>Her power is called Golem Master.</p><br/><p>If this is the power she can draw out from some stuffed animal, what kind of beast will she call forth from a specialized weapon doll\u2026</p><br/><p>Her power just might be strongest among the five.</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 I was able to keep running the whole time, so no problem.</p><br/><p>I hadn\u2019t expected the strongest power to be saved for last, so I\u2019m glad I was able to save face.</p><br/><p>When she summoned ten of them I almost snapped and burned the whole place to the ground. But, I held it in and focused on running away.</p><br/><p>I thought that if I burned them I\u2019d have to console her afterwards.</p><br/><p>Anyways, thus the five have come to know my power.</p><br/><p>The abilities they possess are as described.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a great mismatch between what you\u2019d expect from them and what actually is there. Why have their skills developed in such weird ways, you might ask?</p><br/><p>Probably, these are the skills that they have desired from the bottom of their hearts.</p><br/><p>So, my only choices are either to have them acquire a unique skill or search for some other method.</p><br/><p>Within the next three months, their powers will go wild causing their bodies to collapse.</p><br/><p>A drastic measure, but I was able to confirm their status.</p><br/><p>And, I found that using all of one\u2019s power is the best method to stall the collapse.</p><br/><p>Each time they release the excess energy they extend the deadline by a little bit.</p><br/><p>Now, as for the actual treatment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, as this test has shown you, I\u2019m strong!</p><br/><p>And this strong \u201cI\u201d will promise you: I will save you.</p><br/><p>I swear on this mask, I will find a solution!\u300d</p><br/><p>So I declared to the children.</p><br/><p>They all diligently listened to my words.</p><br/><p>First, I was successful at getting their attention. After all, if you don\u2019t put you mind to it, you aren\u2019t actually listening.</p><br/><p>Somehow \u2013 perhaps they just feel obligated \u2013 I got them to listen.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, is that mask, Shizu-sensei\u2019s?\u300d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Alice timidly asked.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is. Shizu-san entrusted it to me.</p><br/><p>And, other than entrusting the mask to me, she entrusted you bunch as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>So I answered. Though the mask\u2019s appearance has changed slightly, she was able to notice.</p><br/><p>She nodded with satisfaction at my response.</p><br/><p>Seems like some of her worries were dispelled.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 now that she mentioned the mask\u2026</p><br/><p>Some memory appeared in my mind.</p><br/><p>What Shizu-san left me\u2026</p><br/><p>Hmm? It was to hit Demon Lord Leon.</p><br/><p>But could Shizu-san have planned to defeat a Demon Lord?</p><br/><p>Wait a second\u2026 Shizu-san came over here when she was 10, right?</p><br/><p>So why did he save her?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s think about it. Though I don\u2019t know the details, I feel like there\u2019s a hint buried in these memories.</p><br/><p>Besides, it seems strange that Shizu-san would just abandon the kids to pursue her own goals.</p><br/><p>Perhaps punching Leon and saving the kids was one and the same task?</p><br/><p>In that case, Demon Lord Leon must known of a way to save the kids.</p><br/><p>He had saved her once before, after all\u2026</p><br/><p>In that case, what is the method?</p><br/><p>Along with Great Sage, we\u2019re busy considering these things.</p><br/><p>And, as always, Great Sage did not fail my expectations.</p><br/><p>Had Demon Lord Leon saved Shizu-san intentionally or by accident? The answer\u2026</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. The chance that Demon Lord Leon saved Izawa Shizue intentionally is about 74%.</p><br/><p>However, this percentage is a mere prediction, and is thus meaningless.</p><br/><p>Also, regarding the way to save the children\u2026\u226b</p><br/><p>I was not mistaken.</p><br/><p>\u300cListen up, I will absolutely save you. We\u2019ll prepare for this starting tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Believe in me! I will not let you, whom Shizu-san entrusted to me, die!\u300d</p><br/><p>Unlike my previous words, this time I was confident.</p><br/><p>The children, likewise, responded seriously,</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cPlease, sensei!!!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Sensei, huh.</p><br/><p>What a pleasant word. Leave it to me.</p><br/><p>Now, for the first time, I approved of the children.</p><br/><p>I will save them.</p><br/><p>So I swore to myself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

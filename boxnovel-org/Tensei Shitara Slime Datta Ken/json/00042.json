I\u2019ve gotten another unique skill!</p><br/><p>Well, though I actually haven\u2019t gotten the unique skill [Starving Ones], I did absorb its potential.</p><br/><p>That is, my [Predator] has changed into [Gluttony].</p><br/><p>Analyzing the skill made me want to seal it away.</p><br/><p>Nope. It\u2019s too dangerous of a skill.</p><br/><p>And while I was thinking these things,</p><br/><p>\u300cMu? Somehow my power feels as if though it\u2019s boiling\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy wounds are healing faster! Have all been restored already?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I heard such voices.</p><br/><p>Hmm. As I had thought.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the effect of [Gluttony].</p><br/><p>Its effects are,</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. Changing into unique skill [Gluttony] has added the following effects\u2026</p><br/><p>Decay: The ability to decompose the target. Ability to add decomposition status effect.</p><br/><p>There is now a chance of acquiring an ability after consuming only a part of a monster\u2019s corpse (\u203b Random)</p><br/><p>Supply: Whether a subordinate or not, you can now grant an ability unto a monster with whom you have a relationship. (\u203b Limited by the target\u2019s inherent magical energy)</p><br/><p>Food Chain: It is now possible to acquire skills from your subordinates (\u203b All of them)</p><br/><p>These three have become your power.\u226b</p><br/><p>Is what it said. The five original abilities of predator stayed the same, and these three were added.</p><br/><p>And along with that, my stomach capacity seems to have doubled.</p><br/><p>So does this mean that I can now use Benimaru and Ranga\u2019s skills that they\u2019ve gotten from evolution?</p><br/><p>\u226aSolution. It is possible.\u226b</p><br/><p>Seriously?!</p><br/><p>So whenever they get stronger I get stronger, and the opposite is also true.</p><br/><p>How terrifying this power had become!</p><br/><p>Though as you\u2019d expect, I can\u2019t share knowledge this way or transmit magic.</p><br/><p>Of course, proficiency I also need to raise on my own. Daily effort is important, after all.</p><br/><p>But seriously, what an absurd power I got my hands on.</p><br/><p>As expected of Orc Disaster.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a shame I couldn\u2019t eat the clown earlier, but I did get some spare change from him.</p><br/><p>Particularly, through pure luck, I have gotten \u3008Flight Magic\u3009!</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t need incantations to use it. I can fly around just by willing to do so.</p><br/><p>Well, I\u2019ll slowly practice with it, and along the way learn to fly at supersonic speeds.</p><br/><p>But more than getting my hands on unique skills and such, I was able to optimize [Great Sage] and further integrate all my skills.</p><br/><p>For example, I had thought that I can\u2019t mimic all monsters at a time\u2026 but I was wrong.</p><br/><p>And if you\u2019re wondering about \u300eDevil Transformation\u300f, my human version has acquired a new strongest form.</p><br/><p>This too I will carefully research later.</p><br/><p>This all aside, I did just mention that the war has ended.</p><br/><p>The battlefield was filled with happiness, sadness, and despair.</p><br/><p>Now then.</p><br/><p>I think it every time after a battle, but more troublesome than the war itself are the reparations afterwards.</p><br/><p>The day after the Orc Disaster was exterminated.</p><br/><p>In the center of the marshes, in a temporary tent, the representative of every race has gathered.</p><br/><p>From our side came I, Benimaru, Shion, Hakurou, and Souei. Ranga is lurking within my shadow as always.</p><br/><p>I am in my slime form, sitting on Shion\u2019s knees.</p><br/><p>Since I had shown them my true form when I defeated Orc Disaster there is no need to conceal it now.</p><br/><p>From the lizardmen\u2013the Head, Guard Captain, and Guard Vice Captain.</p><br/><p>Gabil is imprisoned for treason. Even if they are parent and child, insubordination is bad.</p><br/><p>Though he\u2019s an idiot, he does have some amusing points. And since it\u2019s not the time to discuss his sentence, we\u2019ll just leave him there for now.</p><br/><p>The orcs sent the one remaining Orc General and ten clan chief representatives.</p><br/><p>They were all pale, depression visible on their faces.</p><br/><p>The reason for the previous chaos was, indubitably, the orcs.</p><br/><p>No matter how hard anyone tries to pin all the blame on the Orc Lord\u2019s manipulation, they were clearly not blameless.</p><br/><p>And it is because they understand this fact, that their expressions are so dark.</p><br/><p>According to what Souei had gathered, they didn\u2019t prepare that much food.</p><br/><p>Through cannibalism and the effects of the unique skill, they were able to advance while starving. Now that they have lost the skill\u2019s effects they can\u2019t possibly eat their brethren.</p><br/><p>Their rather unfortunate situation made the atmosphere in the room even heavier.</p><br/><p>They are fully expecting to be demanded to take responsibility for the war, but they also know that they can\u2019t possibly pay reparations.</p><br/><p>As in the first place, the main cause for the war was the perpetually starving orcs and their leaders who could do naught about it.</p><br/><p>Even considering that their numbers have decreased, there are still 150 thousand of them. There\u2019s not enough food to feed them all.</p><br/><p>And the fact that even with this many troops they can\u2019t continue combat simply emphasizes just how cornered the orcs are.</p><br/><p>If they did not have the [Starving Ones] skill, they would have all perished from hunger.</p><br/><p>Though there are 150 thousand of them, that also includes women, children and the young. It was a mass exodus of the orc race.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>The cause was a severe famine.</p><br/><p>The Magic Continent is a land with fertile soil under the protection of the demon lords.</p><br/><p>Many powerful demonic beasts and demons inhabit it, but thanks to the demon lords, it is safe.</p><br/><p>However, there was a price for safety. A steep tax.</p><br/><p>Those who wanted to live on fertile lands had to provide a large amount of crop.</p><br/><p>Orc, who reproduced quickly, worked in the mines and toiled the fields, and were necessary to the demon lords.</p><br/><p>However. Those who could not pay the tax were immediately killed.</p><br/><p>The demon lord never lends a helping hand.</p><br/><p>Aiming for the abundant resources, many monsters attack.</p><br/><p>Those that have not paid a protection tax are not protected.</p><br/><p>Thus that land inevitably becomes dangerous.</p><br/><p>The fertile orcs, even if the majority of them were killed, would soon enough restore their population to needed levels.</p><br/><p>Though there was a need to control their number, the demon lords decided that the extras would die anyways.</p><br/><p>Now, thanks to a great famine, they could not pay their tax.</p><br/><p>Thus, losing the protection of the demon lords, they decided to flee those lands in search of a safe haven.</p><br/><p>While beset by hunger, the orc lord was born among them, but until then they would never fight anyone stronger than themselves.</p><br/><p>And thus wandering, they have made their way to Jura Forest\u2019s outskirts.</p><br/><p>Around that time, a devil named Gelmudo offered them a hand.</p><br/><p>Oblivious to his machinations, they decided to accept his offer.</p><br/><p>And thus, following his directions, they plunged Jura Forest into chaos.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>The conference began with a heavy atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Hakurou presided over it.</p><br/><p>I had originally asked the Lizardmen\u2019s Guard Captain to do it, but he refused.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat role is too much for one such as I!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, and turned me down.</p><br/><p>And since this wasn\u2019t something I could delegate to the defeated, I imposed\u2026 asked the most fitting man\u2013Hakurou to do it.</p><br/><p>Hakurou had declared the conference open, but no one said anything.</p><br/><p>Everyone was looking at me.</p><br/><p>How annoying. I seriously hate conferences.</p><br/><p>Well, it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>\u300cBefore we begin the conference, I wish to share the information I have gathered. Listen!\u300d</p><br/><p>I exclaimed. At my words, everyone\u2019s expressions hardened, and they fixated their gazes on me.</p><br/><p>And then I conveyed the information I have gotten from Souei and Orc Disaster.</p><br/><p>The cause for the Orc uprising, and their current situation.</p><br/><p>The orc representatives, not expecting me to bring these things up, stared at me with wonder.</p><br/><p>There a few who shed tears listening to me. They were fully convinced that they\u2019d all be executed without a chance to explain themselves.</p><br/><p>Then my story ended.</p><br/><p>And giving Hakurou the signal, I continued the conference.</p><br/><p>\u300cAhem! Now then, the first let\u2019s confirm the casualties!\u300d</p><br/><p>And thus the discussion started.</p><br/><p>Lizardmen\u2019s head discussed their casualties.</p><br/><p>Listening to his report, the Orcs hid their faces and stayed silent.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, Head-dono, do you have any demands for the orcs?\u300d</p><br/><p>After discussing the losses, the discussion proceeded to discuss appropriate payment.</p><br/><p>Though I\u2019ve never experienced an actual war before so I wouldn\u2019t know, but they probably have the winner demand things from the loser.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t prevent the conversation from going this way.</p><br/><p>\u300cNothing specific. This victory was not wrought by our strength. We were saved by Rimuru-dono!\u300d</p><br/><p>Abandoning the right to reparations, the Head thus replied.</p><br/><p>Not like they could do much in the first place, though.</p><br/><p>Alright. Let\u2019s let theorcs speak now, but when I had just looked at them</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease pardon my interruption! Please allow me to compensate for this incident with my life! Of course, I understand that it is not enough, but I have no followers to add!\u300d</p><br/><p>Orc Generals calls out, falling prostrate before me.</p><br/><p>He desperately pleads\\</p><br/><p>\u201cI have become a B rank monster, and gained quite a lot of magical energy, so please forgive the rest with my death!\u201d Is what he says.</p><br/><p>Not that I\u2019m planning on that, but that\u2019s not the problematic point.</p><br/><p>Damn it, conferences are annoying.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s just do this my way.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait. Rimuru-sama has something to say!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hakurou intervened.</p><br/><p>The Orc General shut up, and looked at me.</p><br/><p>The rest, as well, quietly waited for me to speak. Just the atmosphere that I hate.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, so this is my first conference, so I\u2019m not sure I can handle this well. Thus, I\u2019ll just say what I think. After that, I want you all to discuss my words.\u300d</p><br/><p>Having said that I proceeded to discuss my thoughts.</p><br/><p>First, that I thought that we should not pursue the discussion about the orcs\u2019 sins.</p><br/><p>Next, that I wanted to continue the alliance with the Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>And finally, that I wanted the orcs to join that alliance.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd those are my thoughts. I bet you have many things you want to say, but know this: I will not permit any punishment to befall the orcs. That is because I have thus promised to Orc Disaster. I will bear all their sins. If you got something to complain about, let me hear it!\u300d</p><br/><p>So I declared.</p><br/><p>The orcs stared at me amazed.</p><br/><p>In contrast to them, the Head asked a question.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe are completely satisfied with what you have said. However, we do have a question\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNow that the war has ended, why do we need an alliance?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAbout that, huh. To explain\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>And thus I explained that point further. My plan to create the Great Jura Forest Coalition.</p><br/><p>In the first place, if we ended the conversation with \u201cNo punishment! Dismissed!\u201d the orcs would simply die from hunger.</p><br/><p>Lacking in discipline, some would attack lizardmen and goblin villages.</p><br/><p>Their hunger was the cause for this mess in the first place. It\u2019s meaningless if we don\u2019t solve it.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll form a coalition.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen can offer fertile fishing grounds and fish.</p><br/><p>The goblins\u2026 can\u2019t expect much from them.</p><br/><p>My city can provide processed goods.</p><br/><p>And the orcs excel at manual labor.</p><br/><p>They can inhabit the lands away from the marshes. Those originally owned by the ogres.</p><br/><p>That place is also by a foot of a mountain with abundant resources.</p><br/><p>Speaking of area alone, all 150 thousand couldn\u2019t possibly all live on the same land, but they could split into Mountain district, Mountain-base district, River-district, and the Forest district and thus live.</p><br/><p>If the particularly large clans split into individual districts, this\u2019ll work\u2026 somehow.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll provide the technical support about constructing housing and such. However, we\u2019ll work the orcs hard in return.</p><br/><p>After all, our village\u2019s population is too small and many things are left undone.</p><br/><p>That I want to finish all in one go.</p><br/><p>That much I explained to them.</p><br/><p>Everyone heard the same explanation.</p><br/><p>Unlike last time, this declaration left everybody greatly excited.</p><br/><p>Their fears wiped away, a fire of hope was lit in their hearts.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Shion, who had been holding me, bent her back and haughtily laughed *Fufun!*. That, of course, I could not permit.</p><br/><p>However, then her breasts touched me with a puyooon!</p><br/><p>Ah, whatever, I permit it. I am a gracious lord!</p><br/><p>\u300cY-y-you\u2019d permit us\u2026 to join your coalition\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>The orc general fearfully asked.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou can work, right? I won\u2019t let you slack off\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cO-of course! We\u2019ll work as if our lives depended on it!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The orcs trembled, tears falling from their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe have no objections. Rather, we\u2019d like to aid you!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen\u2019s Head also voiced his agreement. Seems like they\u2019ve all accepted my plan.</p><br/><p>Now that we have everyone\u2019s consent, the Great Jura Forest Coalition is born.</p><br/><p>However, a problem remains.</p><br/><p>An unnaturally troubling, worrisome problem!</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry for bringing this up while you\u2019re rejoicing, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cQuiet. Now that everyone has agreed, I want us to tackle the largest problem!</p><br/><p>That is\u2026 provision!</p><br/><p>How do we prevent 150 thousand orcs from starving?</p><br/><p>I want everyone to lend me their wisdom in this!\u300d</p><br/><p>The last great perplexity.</p><br/><p>Provision, or rather\u2013the lack of thereof, is the problem. The orcs have enough for three days.</p><br/><p>Even if we plant crops now, we won\u2019t make it in time; if we fish for food, we\u2019ll clean the lake dry.</p><br/><p>A troubling dilemma is upon us.</p><br/><p>The lizardmen have enough food to feed ten thousand for half a year.</p><br/><p>Even if we gave all of that up, 150 thousand would eat it in twelve days.</p><br/><p>So what can we do\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone was scratching their heads thinking about it.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>\u300cPardon the interruption during the conference! There is an emissary that desperately seeks your audience!\u300d</p><br/><p>A Lizardman had run in saying.</p><br/><p>Seems to be very flustered.</p><br/><p>After I nodded to Hakurou,</p><br/><p>\u300cShow them in!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hakurou responded, sending the soldier away.</p><br/><p>An emissary? From whom?</p><br/><p>As if answering my question, a single \u201cperson\u201d had entered the tent.</p><br/><p>A Dryad.</p><br/><p>A beautiful girl with green hair. Like the people of Europe, her skin was white with well defined facial features.</p><br/><p>Plump lips, and blue eyes that suit her well. If measured in human years, she\u2019d look about 16-18 years old.</p><br/><p>A guardian spirit of the Treants. Among the monsters, she would rank among the top of A rank.</p><br/><p>Many voiced their surprise when she entered.</p><br/><p>Well duh, you\u2019d be surprised. As I heard later, it\u2019s been many hundreds of years since a Dryad \u201cLayato\u201d has last been seen.</p><br/><p>With long life spans (immortal, actually) these women rarely leave their sacred dwellings.</p><br/><p>You would normally be happy if they had sent a messenger.</p><br/><p>Dryad \u201cLayato\u201d looked around the room and focused her eyes on me.</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease to meet you, everyone!</p><br/><p>I am a Dryad \u201cLayato\u201d trainee. Pleased to make your acquaintance.</p><br/><p>I had come today to exterminate the orc lord\u2026</p><br/><p>But that seems to have been done already.</p><br/><p>I was planning to leave a second ago, but decided to at least greet everyone.</p><br/><p>And then I found that you are troubled over a certain problem. I ask that you listen to what I have to say!\u300d</p><br/><p>She said with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>But she also seemed perfectly calm.</p><br/><p>And immediately continued her speech.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seem you lack provisions, correct? I believe we could assist with that.</p><br/><p>However\u2026,</p><br/><p>We ask that our beneficiaries, the Treants, are allowed to join your coalition!\u300d</p><br/><p>We have no reason to reject. Actually, we would gladly accept.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, we are grateful for the offer, but why would you want to join the coalition?\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked on everyone\u2019s behalf.</p><br/><p>And when I did,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Treants are a race that hardly move.</p><br/><p>Thus, they have little interaction with other races.</p><br/><p>Should they be attacked by a powerful opponent or face some natural disaster, they would be helpless.</p><br/><p>We the Dryads could escape on our own, but we are few in number\u2026</p><br/><p>If we were to join an alliance, we could receive help when needed, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>She responded with a pure smile.</p><br/><p>Could she be willing to put her trust in a our good will?</p><br/><p>Do you honestly believe strangers\u2019 words? Since you haven\u2019t met that many, you aren\u2019t even doubting them, right?</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t read any hidden intentions from her smile.</p><br/><p>Of course, I have no intention of betraying her.</p><br/><p>However, a girl like her would find herself in danger due to her trust\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course! When troubled, our lord Rimuru-sama would help somehow!\u300d</p><br/><p>With a Fufun! Shion selfishly replied.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t forget to mention that there are also things I can\u2019t do, lass!</p><br/><p>I wanted to interject, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>\u300cMaa! So it was as I thought!</p><br/><p>In that case, please take care of us from now on.\u300d</p><br/><p>She ended the conversation with a smile.</p><br/><p>Umm\u2026 my opinion was completely ignored the moment it mattered\u2026 but whatever.</p><br/><p>I guess I must concede here.</p><br/><p>Thus, the Great Jura Forest Coalition was established.</p><br/><p>Its members,</p><br/><p>Rimuru\u2019s Happy Bunch.</p><br/><p>Goblins</p><br/><p>Lizardmen</p><br/><p>Orcs</p><br/><p>Treants</p><br/><p>And leading this coalition, (hopefully temporarily) is me.</p><br/><p>This day, my name was for the first time etched into the history of this world.</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru (Disaster) Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime (Human Form Possible)</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: The Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Title: One who leads Demons</p><br/><p>Magic: \u3008Thought Battle Magic\u3009\u3008Flight Magic\u3009</p><br/><p>Skills: Slime Specific Skills \u300eAbsorb, Dissolve, Regenerate EX\u300f</p><br/><p>Unique Skill \u300eGreat Sage\u300fThought Acceleration, Analysis, Parallel Processing, Incantation Nullification, All of Creation</p><br/><p>Unique Skill \u300eGluttony\u300f Stomach, Mimicry, Separation, Decay, Supply, Food</p><br/><p>Chain</p><br/><p>\u300eShapeshifter\u300fFusion, Separation</p><br/><p>Extra Skills\u300eSegmenting\u300f\u300eBlack Flame\u300f\u300eBlack Lightning\u300f\u300eBarrier\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eShadow Step\u300f</p><br/><p>Daily skills \u300eMagic Perception\u300f\u300eHeat detection\u300f\u300eAuditory Perception\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eSupreme Olfaction\u300f\u300eIntimidation\u300f\u300eHerculean Strength\u300f</p><br/><p>Battle Skills \u300eNoxious and Paralysis Breath\u300f\u300eFull Body Armor\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eSticky Thread\u300f\u300eTelepathic Communication\u300f\u300eCloning\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eDevil Transformation\u300f\u300eFlame Transformation\u300f</p><br/><p>Mimicking: Flame Giant, Black Wolf, Black Snake, Lizard, Giant Spider, Giant Bat, Centipede, Goblin, Orc</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance EX, Physical Damage Resistance, Pain Resistance, Heat Attack Resistance, Paralysis Resistance, Corrosion Resistance, Electricity Resistance</p><br/>\n</div>"}

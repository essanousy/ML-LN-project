I\u2019m sorry to say it, Sharma. But I believed you were all being tricked.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018We were told to gather our fighting force. I shall give you my support. We will send as many men as we can.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Zalando. Aren\u2019t you being a little hasty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps. But, Blancha. There is no future for us unless we act. Many are dying due to our life support machines failing. We cannot find new homes now. It is too late. Even if it turns out to be a trap, we have no other hope.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s true. We must give this some thought\u2026 I had wanted to watch you a little longer before deciding. But I shall come to a decision tonight.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their reactions varied.</p><br/><p>As Sharma had arrived earlier than scheduled, many of them had not come to a decision yet.</p><br/><p>And the main reason for this was that most of them did not entirely trust Michelle. They believed that Sharma was being deceived.</p><br/><p>However, now that Sharma had arrived safely, they were starting to think that they could trust Michelle.</p><br/><p>Still, it seemed that it would be difficult for them all to be in agreement.</p><br/><p>And so it was decided that the talks would end for now, and they would continue the meeting on the following morning.</p><br/><p>Now they just had to wait for their answers.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what Sharma thought.</p><br/><p>Michelle had requested that they gather a fighting force that they could trust.</p><br/><p>However, information was still to be kept from them for the most part.</p><br/><p>Each director knew that Michelle was a collaborator. Michelle had allowed her to share this information.</p><br/><p>Even if there was a spy in their midst, Michelle thought it would be a good opprotunity to find the traitors. This willingness to sacrifice herself was well-received by the others, and Sharma fully trusted her now.</p><br/><p>And so she had told the other directors of Michelle\u2019s request, that they gather their men.</p><br/><p>There was a possibility of fighting within the empire, and the resistance would act in accordance.</p><br/><p>She told them that Michelle would be in their debt after this, and would promise to aid them\u2026</p><br/><p>It was no surprise that the other directors had their doubts.</p><br/><p>They too had comrades to protect. They did not want to lose men if there was no need.</p><br/><p>It would be difficult to persuade them, but not impossible\u2014that\u2019s what Sharma thought.</p><br/><p>As some of the directors had said, the shelters were at their limits.</p><br/><p>The surface was full of threats, but their claustrophobic homes would no longer be able to support them.</p><br/><p>So they had no choice but to strike out.</p><br/><p>In that case, there was no better time than now.</p><br/><p>They had a collaborator within the empire. Michelle. And so helping Michelle to destroy the current regime became a path to survival for the resistance.</p><br/><p>With this renewed conviction, Sharma directed her thoughts towards tomorrow\u2019s meeting.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, things would not be favorable.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>An unexpected problem awaited them.</p><br/><p>Sharma and the others finished their communication with the directors and returned to the main hall. There, a stranger awaited them.</p><br/><p>She was covered in wounds, proof that a battle had been fought.</p><br/><p>Currently, Karman and Reiz were treating her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is General Michelle\u2019s adjutant. Her name is Jegyll. I don\u2019t know what happened, but she arrived here like this. Barely breathing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman answered Sharma\u2019s nervous question.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the stranger had escaped from the empire.</p><br/><p>But there were no pursuers.</p><br/><p>Jegyll must have killed them so they would not locate this place.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she was wounded so badly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have used healing drugs and she seems to be improving. Her loss of consciousness should be temporary\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Where am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Reiz was explaining this, Jegyll\u2019s eyes cracked open and she muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, she has come to. Adjutant Jegyll, it is me. Reiz. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReiz\u2026 So this must be Shelter 5. The one that General Michelle prepared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid anyone follow me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Karman\u2019s men are patrolling the area. No enemies have been sighted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. So I killed all of them then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll said. Then she sighed with relief.</p><br/><p>Karman nodded and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAdjutant Jegyll. It\u2019s Karman. General Michelle told me everything. I am now just like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. That is comforting. As for the rest of you, I apologize for such a rude greeting. I am Jegyll. I am Michelle\u2019s adjutant and I know of her intentions. I am not your enemy. Please rest easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll said this, and Sharma and the others introduced themselves.</p><br/><p>While this happened, a man who could not read the room\u2014or had no intention of trying\u2014asked Jegyll a very blunt question.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Jegyll or whatever your name is. Why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey!? Zaza became frantic.</p><br/><p>Not just Zaza, but Karman and Sharma as well.</p><br/><p>Reiz was speechless at the lack of manners.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-9\"></div><div class=\"code-block code-block-5 ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2\"></div><br/><p>This person was Michelle\u2019s adjutant. A noble of the highest rank who belonged in the ruling class of the empire.</p><br/><p>And yet he had no respect for her.</p><br/><p>Even Reiz felt he had to say something\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo-now, now, Mister Reiz. Calm down. And Mister Veldora, let\u2019s try to be a little more polite. Actually, we will be dealing with all the negotiations. You can go over there and play with the children\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Rindo said as he quickly stepped in between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cKa-Hahahaha! The children are already asleep, thanks to my flawless ability to babysit. Besides, negotiations are very important. You must leave it to me. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let things go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about!! Everyone who knew Veldora thought this.</p><br/><p>However, none of them said it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cHohohoho. We cannot allow Lord Veldora to do something as low as that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-yes, Master. We have a nice room prepared. Why don\u2019t you go and have a rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm. I hope you are not just trying to get rid of me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora muttered as he started to walk away, but then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s right! This is no time for talk. General Michelle has been taken!! You must help me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll\u2019s face went pale as she dropped this unbelievable bomb on them.</p><br/><p>And so in a flash, the situation suddenly changed for the worse.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

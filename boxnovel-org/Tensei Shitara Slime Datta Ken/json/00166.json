All the summoning done in this world had similar practices.</p><br/><p>On a side note, sometimes, there are those who try to summon Devils because they think they can put them under the fealty curse.</p><br/><p>Aside from humans, or Angels or Spirits with weak egos, Spirit Forms like Devils, who have strong egos, will often Resist the curse.</p><br/><p>There are such arrogant fools who delve into the forbidden summoning arts putting too much confidence in their skills.</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat has been in preparation for quite some time now, so the people gathered were vaguely aware of what was going on.</p><br/><p>A majority of them were \u2018Otherworlders\u2019 who had shown talent in the military.</p><br/><p>They had climbed up the ranks relying on their own power.</p><br/><p>Having no loyalty towards the Empire from the beginning, there were those among them who were excited at the prospect of a revolution.</p><br/><p>There were others who were mix-breeds created by mating strong individuals of different races repeatedly, and still others who were slave warriors that Yuuki had procured.</p><br/><p>In the Empire, might was right, so given the chance, even a slave could take hold of his freedom.</p><br/><p>The Monster slaves gathered by Damrada were also present.</p><br/><p>Such a thing would be preposterous in the Western nations, but the Empire simply had a different set of values.</p><br/><p>For this reason, Yuuki had ordered the battle-oriented monsters that showed potential to be brought into the Empire.</p><br/><p>Breaking it down: 30 \u2018Otherworlders\u2019, 50 devils, 100 mix-breed warriors, 100 slave warriors.</p><br/><p>In the Mixed-Corps, they were the ones on the stronger side.</p><br/><p>With Otherworlders, Devils, and Officer-class individuals, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that they would be members of the Mixed Corps headquarters.</p><br/><p>Ascending the stairs from a large open lobby, they arrived at the large room built for conferences on the second floor.</p><br/><p>As all of them had sat down, Yuuki and Kagari, and finally Damrada entered the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, everyone.</p><br/><p>So today, I think we\u2019ll kill the Emperor.</p><br/><p>The enemy are 100 Royal Knights (TN: change; Emperors Personal Guards -&gt; Royal Knights)</p><br/><p>Some of you have already fought with them in hopes of raising your ranks, so you know they\u2019re pretty strong.</p><br/><p>But we have 100,000 troops on our side, so it\u2019s a no brainer.</p><br/><p>I just got the report that the Mixed Corps have successfully stationed themselves on the outskirts of the capital.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll close off the 4 gates, and erect a force field to prevent escape.</p><br/><p>And when that\u2019s done, we\u2019ll be scorching the place, and broil the Emperor.</p><br/><p>Easy right?</p><br/><p>So today, you can fight the Knights without holding back at all.</p><br/><p>They will likely have Legendary-tier gear on them, so capturing them alive is probably impossible.</p><br/><p>So don\u2019t worry and go kill them.</p><br/><p>Any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuuki casually talked about killing the Emperor as if discussing the weather.</p><br/><p>The ones who gathered now had eyes full of ambition.</p><br/><p>Their hopes becoming reality, they were ecstatic with being able to finally take action.</p><br/><p>It was now time.</p><br/><p>On the outskirts of the capital, Black Knight Claude had secretly gathered the Mixed Corps troops.</p><br/><p>They were positioned there over the course of several days so that nothing would seem unnatural.</p><br/><p>Just moments ago, Yuuki received report through \u2018Telepathy\u2019 that all preparations were complete.</p><br/><p>It was proceeding smoothly.</p><br/><p>According to the plan, the Mixed Corps would flow in after breaking through the 4 gates, and they would supervise from the mansion.</p><br/><p>The Empires strength was the 100 Royal Knights, and 2000 guardsmen.</p><br/><p>And around 20,000 from the Military Police Division?</p><br/><p>Though, the difference in power between the army and the police was very large.</p><br/><p>A difference similar to that of an adult and a child, they would only slightly slow them down.</p><br/><p>The real threat was, in fact, the Royal Knights and the 2000 guardsmen.</p><br/><p>The Mixed Corps would be pit against them while they watched the movements of the Knights. Then, they would target the ones who are isolated, and slowly wean out their numbers.</p><br/><p>In other words, the Mixed Corps would serve as bait and rampage all over the city.</p><br/><p>The Royal Knights were a threat to Yuuki, so with luck, he could turn them into pawns using Overwrite.</p><br/><p>Their fealty to the Emperor would be then directed at him.</p><br/><p>For that reason too, they needed to be reeled in after biting into the bait.</p><br/><p>The troops Yuuki had gathered fell short in strength compared to the Royal Knights.</p><br/><p>But by cornering them in greater numbers, and Yuuki stepping in from that point, he could increase his number of pawns without much effort.</p><br/><p>Like that, they would not only overwhelm the Empire with numbers, but also turn their forces against them.</p><br/><p>At that point, it would be check and mate.</p><br/><p>There were no reinforcements coming for them, and rather easily, victory would draw closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cA coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, I see.</p><br/><p>It\u2019ll fail, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if pouring cold water on his head, denying Yuuki\u2019s ambitions, Damrada stated.</p><br/><p>He was a man who had a big role in building the Freedom Association and \u2018Cerberus\u2019, and had essentially become Yuuki\u2019s hands and feet.</p><br/><p>He could make calm judgements, and had a strong nose for money.</p><br/><p>Having unbelievable skill at determining the success rate of things, this statement of his was not to be dismissed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Damrada?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly what I said. Just now, they got Miranda.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took off his necklace as he spoke.</p><br/><p>It had a charm shaped like a three headed dragon on it, but one of the heads were broken.</p><br/><p>It was a charm that all three Bosses possessed, a Magic Item that allowed them to confirm each others\u2019 survival.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fact that this piece got broken, means that Miranda was killed.</p><br/><p>Which implies that the whole plan was leaked to the Emperor.</p><br/><p>And now that failure is all but confirmed, going through with this plan is plain suicide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damrada explained calmly.</p><br/><p>He had spoken in his usual tone, but Yuuki sensed something fundamentally different about it.</p><br/><p>Damrada\u2019s words stirred doubt into the hearts of those who had gathered.</p><br/><p>Their faces that were brimming with confidence and excitement, now showed anxious expressions.</p><br/><p>Yuuki looked at them with an unsatisfied expression and,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we can just attack before they\u2019re ready right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He spat out.</p><br/><p>If their plan was leaked just recently, they had the upper hand in acting first.</p><br/><p>It would be out of order, but they would have to kill the Emperor first.</p><br/><p>And if push came to shove, Yuuki would go personally.</p><br/><p>As if denying Yuuki\u2019s countermeasures,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late. You\u2019re severely underestimating the Information Bureau, Yuuki-sama.</p><br/><p>Your plan is too na\u00efve.</p><br/><p>This is not a children\u2019s game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damrada replied, casting a cold gaze at Yuuki.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, you dare show Yuuki-sama such disrespect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Infuriated, Kagari thrust a hand towards Damrada\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>But Damrada gently gripped her wrist, and, manipulating the flow of power, directed the force back into her wrist.</p><br/><p>The force converged into a singular point, and the bones in Kagari\u2019s wrist easily broke.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kagari groaned, and took some distance from Damrada, rubbing her wrist.</p><br/><p>Yuuki narrowed his eyes in confusion.</p><br/><p>Damrada was certainly a master of martial arts, and his offensive strength was high.</p><br/><p>But, Kagari was an ex-Demon Lord, and wasn\u2019t someone so meager so as normal humans could pose a challenge.</p><br/><p>As far as Yuuki was concerned, it was impossible for Damrada to win against Kagari.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamrada, are you betraying me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuuki asked quietly.</p><br/><p>Depending on this answer, Damrada needed to be killed then and there.</p><br/><p>\u201cBetray? You say strange things.</p><br/><p>I have already been cooperating and have sworn loyalty to you to a certain extent.</p><br/><p>But I only did this temporarily.</p><br/><p>That would be that case yes?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a saying, \u2018The rich have many friends\u2019. (TN: Originally, \u2018The end of money brings the end of the relationship\u2019.)</p><br/><p>In my case, I was being useful to the Emperor by being useful to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damrada\u2019s cold voice echoed.</p><br/><p>The tension in the room was thick, and no one raised a word.</p><br/><p>Damrada was looking down on Yuuki\u2019s friends in the army who stank of greed.</p><br/><p>But that Damrada had brilliantly gave the fearsome Kagari a run for her money.</p><br/><p>Their impression of him changed drastically.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>You were planning to use me from the beginning\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t deny that. It\u2019s something like a specialty of mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuuki now understood everything.</p><br/><p>Whether is was the establishment of the Freedom Association, or \u2018Cerberus\u2019, everything went according to the Empire\u2019s plans.</p><br/><p>The organization known as \u2018Cerberus\u2019 was, originally, a base created with people that Damrada had gathered.</p><br/><p>It worked as an Intelligence Division in the Western Nations.</p><br/><p>It collected secrets, and sorted them by usefulness.</p><br/><p>It dealt mainly with Nobles to get a hold of their weaknesses.</p><br/><p>When the Empire decided to take over the West, these secrets would become power. Power enough to fell countries solely through blackmail.</p><br/><p>Damrada who was entrusted with carrying all this out, had set his sights on Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Damrada would stand out too much as himself.</p><br/><p>Yuuki thus acted as a beacon that attracted all the attention.</p><br/><p>In other words, Yuuki had been used when he wanted to do the using.</p><br/><p>A tiny flame of anger was born in Yuuki\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>It was a flame called humiliation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the Empires dog.</p><br/><p>Good job on deceiving me.</p><br/><p>But to reveal it all by yourself right here, wasn\u2019t it a bit premature?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly, I\u2019m going to end you here and now, Damrada!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kagari agreed with Yuuki.</p><br/><p>And she launched towards Damrada, still in rage.</p><br/><p>Being an ex-Demon Lord, her speed surpassed that which humans could follow. Damrada was supposed to have no way of reacting.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo slow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Easily deflecting both sets of Kagari\u2019s sharp Demonic Clawed hands thrust towards him, Damrada closed their distance in a natural movement.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t let down his guard just because he had broken her wrist earlier, and attacked mercilessly.</p><br/><p>For monsters, a fracture could be healed in moments.</p><br/><p>One had to have that mindset, or else they wouldn\u2019t survive long in this world.</p><br/><p>Having gotten close enough, he applied his hands softly to the center of Kagari\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiral Penetration Break!!\u201d (TN: \u201cRasen shint\u014d yabu!!\u201d)</p><br/><p>He released the power accumulated in his hands into the enemy.</p><br/><p>It was a Secret Technique that destroyed the enemy\u2019s body with its explosive penetrative power.</p><br/><p>Damrada\u2019s body glowed thinly, as if emitting a concentrated battle-spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cGufu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kagari fell into a crouch, vomiting blood.</p><br/><p>Her legs lacked the strength to even stand.</p><br/><p>Being a \u2018Drifting Spirit\u2019, Demon Lord Kazaream didn\u2019t have the power to maintain a spiritual body. It was impossible as he wasn\u2019t a Spirit Form.</p><br/><p>Which is why, he relied on a body of flesh.</p><br/><p>To compensate, he transformed the body on the Elven female he possessed similar to that of a Demon, and trained it to be peerless in strength.</p><br/><p>Yet, she was disabled by a single hit from Damrada.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-impossible! A mere human can\u2019t possibly-!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kagari cried out while spitting out the blood overflowing from her mouth.</p><br/><p>A Demon Lord being surpassed by a human should not be done.</p><br/><p>Kagari glared at Damrada with such thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cFu, you should think more before you act, lady. This is why you lost against Demon Lord Leon.</p><br/><p>And also\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>You, being a yet unawakened Demon Lord, can\u2019t even hope to beat me.</p><br/><p>Even that old man called Hakurou was much stronger.</p><br/><p>I wanted to go all out on the old man, but unfortunately, I missed my chance.</p><br/><p>Compared to that, you, lady\u2026\u2026 aren\u2019t worthy of my full strength.</p><br/><p>Sure, demons are unbelievably strong, but humans aren\u2019t as stupid as you think.</p><br/><p>There are of course fools who rely only of their Skills, but with the right training, one can endlessly get stronger.</p><br/><p>Like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying so, he looked away from her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Otherworlders\u2019 could be killed by snapping their necks just like anyone else.</p><br/><p>Having uneventfully killed quite a number of them, Yuuki was admittedly one of the strong.</p><br/><p>Damrada possessed a Unique Skill that hid his presence and muffled his movements, specialized in assassination, it was called \u2018Killer\u2019.</p><br/><p>Being dedicated to killing, it was an almost invincible Skill.</p><br/><p>He was an aberrant who liked killing too much, and with help from Yuuki\u2019s Skill, had returned to a calmer, normal state of mind\u2026\u2026 but Damrada could easily revert back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, relying on Skills too much will leave you vulnerable at critical moments.</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t train your body more, you guys are all useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gathered ones, who never faced ridicule from any trainer, were being spoken to as if they were utter weaklings, and couldn\u2019t help but get angry.</p><br/><p>All of them reddened, and directed their murderous intent at Damrada.</p><br/><p>Damrada felt no responsibility for the feelings of those he had betrayed.</p><br/><p>Even if he had been a boss they looked up to as if worshiping.</p><br/><p>If it was by order of the Emperor, he could even kill his own blood relatives.</p><br/><p>Kagurazaka Yuuki was, for Damrada, a fine master.</p><br/><p>He had a na\u00efve childlike though process, but also had a cold-blooded outlook.</p><br/><p>He had good ability to analyze, which Damrada was fond of.</p><br/><p>He was different from the ex-Demon Lord crouching on the floor.</p><br/><p>For that very reason!</p><br/><p>Royals Knights No.2: Damrada wanted to finish him with his own hands.</p><br/><p>That was Damrada\u2019s final act of loyalty towards Yuuki.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

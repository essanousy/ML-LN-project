The Freed One</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t Resurrection Festival work? My words decided\u300eTempest Resurrection Festival\u300fas its official name.</p><br/><p>We are planning on celebrating it every year.</p><br/><p>And now, two days have passed since it ended\u2026</p><br/><p>There are a few problems that are giving me a headache. No, I\u2019m being serious this time.</p><br/><p>After a knocking sound came from my door, Rigurdo and Bester came inside.</p><br/><p>The 14 yet-living assailants.</p><br/><p>We are currently in the middle of gathering information.</p><br/><p>And, all our \u201csources\u201d are meekly confessing all they know.</p><br/><p>It seems that Farmas Kingdom and the like have begun to beg for mercy.</p><br/><p>Even the well trained Blood Shadows and Church\u2019s messengers quickly give up and confess when a demon is presented to them</p><br/><p>A demon can inspire fear into its enemies hearts and thus control the soul.</p><br/><p>While there is a chance to resist a greater demon and inferior, an archdemon like Diablo doesn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer.</p><br/><p>As a result, one usually goes mad, so they decided to confess all they knew rather than meet such a fate.</p><br/><p>By the way, even if they had committed suicide, we can just directly manipulate their soul or tamper with their brains.</p><br/><p>That, too, is a well known ability of greater demons, so no one is foolish enough to kill themselves before one.</p><br/><p>So if you want to disappear along with all of your secrets, you\u2019d have to kill yourself by completely destroying your body.</p><br/><p>I hadn\u2019t thought that capture meant a complete leak of information, but it is common sense in this world.</p><br/><p>So it would be an understatement to say that the spies of this world risk their lives.</p><br/><p>Well, as a result, we were quickly able to obtain information from them.</p><br/><p>As for the headache I mentioned earlier, that would be: what do we do with them now?</p><br/><p>My wrath has subsided when Shion and the rest resurrected.</p><br/><p>As a result, I lost the desire to kill the shabby old man and the church\u2019s dogs.</p><br/><p>Wait, that list does not include the fanatics. Those die no matter what.</p><br/><p>I cannot forgive the perpetrators of that incident.</p><br/><p>According to the information we obtained, they were not ordered to attack the inhabitants during their \u201cvisit\u201d.</p><br/><p>The orders came from Cardinal Nicholas.</p><br/><p>It was simple: declare war.</p><br/><p>But, as deploying the elite knights would require Hinata\u2019s approval, they decided to send their Blood Shadows pets instead, which lead us to that tragedy.</p><br/><p>Thirsting for blood and assured of their superiority, they rampaged without being ordered to.</p><br/><p>Which I found out just as I was thinking of treating the as prisoners of war or by some other martial law.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the general opinion among us was, as we are not humans, we should live by monster rules.</p><br/><p>Anyways, we can kill them at any time.</p><br/><p>So I decided to investigate what other countries do in such situations.</p><br/><p>Ellen and Youmu didn\u2019t know much about the internal dealings of the countries, so it was pointless to ask them.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s when I remembered about Bester.</p><br/><p>Thus, I went to ask his opinion.</p><br/><p>Entering, Bester greeted me by saying,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt has been a while, Rimuru-sama! What a calamity we have endured\u300d</p><br/><p>A calamity it is. It\u2019s not over, after all.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat it was. There\u2019s something I want to ask, what are human wars like?\u300d</p><br/><p>I tried asking Bester.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not good at haggling, nor is there a need to.</p><br/><p>Thus, I heard about human wars from Bester.</p><br/><p>First, members of Conference Coalition do not normally wage war.</p><br/><p>For example, there\u2019s a rule that stipulates that a country has to declare the war at a general conference prior to beginning hostilities.</p><br/><p>If this is not done, the country loses membership, and is recognized as a common enemy for all states.</p><br/><p>Wars are easy to start, hard to stop. I\u2019m surprised to see that phrase has become a rule.</p><br/><p>For now, let\u2019s consider the situation where they did declare war at a conference.</p><br/><p>First, they decide on a date for combat and use that time to evacuate civilians.</p><br/><p>Next, they are not allowed to engage their opponent until the opportune date.</p><br/><p>Information gathering and failure to abide by the above rules constitutes a violation of the Coalition\u2019s code.</p><br/><p>As a result, the concept known as \u201cspy\u201d is generally considered to be currently absurd. Even if they do exist, they must always be on their guard to escape before the civilians are evacuated.</p><br/><p>Any reported violations constitute transgression of the Coalition\u2019s code.</p><br/><p>Well, considering such strict rules, they might as well say that spies are forbidden. Though what kind of spy chooses the profession expecting to be caught?</p><br/><p>After the war has begun there are two kinds of wars: limited war and extermination war. (Well, there\u2019s also economic war, but let\u2019s leave that one aside)</p><br/><p>Limited War is one which seeks to alleviate the burden on the civilians and restrict the battle to a designated battlefield.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s kind of like a sport, the extremest of the extremes, though.</p><br/><p>Of course, to prevent the overwhelming advantage of the terrain, the defending side chooses the field of battle.</p><br/><p>This is also chosen at the moment the war has been declared.</p><br/><p>The latter, the War of Extermination, goes by the \u201canything goes\u201d rule.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t end until one state becomes the other\u2019s vassal or falls completely. Not something you\u2019d want to choose unless you had no other choice.</p><br/><p>In this case, whether you win or lose, you have to have a legitimate reason to invade.</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t, then it\u2019s a simple war of conquest.</p><br/><p>And, you\u2019d incur the risk of being attacked by other coalition members as a result.</p><br/><p>In other words, this type of war rarely, if ever, happens.</p><br/><p>But wouldn\u2019t declaring neutrality be optimal for avoiding conflict? Of course not.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf Kingdom, for example, has advanced technology and great value.</p><br/><p>Thus, they had to build up a power to resist those who would try to conquer them.</p><br/><p>Powerless justice is useless.</p><br/><p>But in reality, it would be hard to explain to other countries why you\u2019re declaring war on the neutral Dwarf Kingdom, and even more so, considering their military might.</p><br/><p>Nobody wants to kill themselves by getting caught up in another\u2019s greed.</p><br/><p>Thus, after some wars resulted in the creation of the Conference, which brings us to the current state of things</p><br/><p>Such are the rules set by the Conference Coalition.</p><br/><p>Now, what about the non-members?</p><br/><p>For example, the Eastern Empire.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a military nation that increased in size by absorbing its weaker neighbors.</p><br/><p>Coalition\u2019s Rules do not apply to this state.</p><br/><p>It invades when it wants and tramples down anyone in its wake.</p><br/><p>So it also makes full use of spies.</p><br/><p>Death to those who disobey!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the principle they live by, so if the target state does not swear allegiance within a week, they immediately invade.</p><br/><p>Luckily, their sphere of influence fails to extend into the Jura Forest, so there have been victims among nearby states.</p><br/><p>But, considering what has happened to states that battled with the Empire, the Conference Coalition cannot ignore this threat.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf Kingdom was somehow able to establish diplomatic relations with the Empire and so avoided a potential invasion.</p><br/><p>Well, their military strength and strength of that king certainly has something to do with it.</p><br/><p>Having heard this information, I can\u2019t help but think of the Coalition as a bunch of weak states coming together for mutual protection.</p><br/><p>Powerful countries decide war and fate by their own strength.</p><br/><p>Of course, even if they don\u2019t violate the rules, it\u2019s not like they won\u2019t deviate from them.</p><br/><p>I see; I understood all of this to a certain degree.</p><br/><p>Now, as for when the war has ended\u2026</p><br/><p>What happens to prisoners of war?</p><br/><p>That, too, Bester had explained.</p><br/><p>The Conference forbids the murder of messengers. That is true in any world, I guess.</p><br/><p>Next, it\u2019s rare for a country\u2019s king to become a prisoner of war.</p><br/><p>Even wars of extermination rarely end up in complete annihilation. Unless you\u2019re a fool, you\u2019d surrender when the war has reached your own soil.</p><br/><p>Refusing the surrender and slaughtering everybody would earn you animosity from other countries.</p><br/><p>In the first place, a king that allows his own land to be invaded quickly loses the trust of his men and is disposed of.</p><br/><p>In other words, since he\u2019s been dishonored, there\u2019s no need to kill him. That\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>In that case, while I can just kill him off, sending him back might be a better idea.</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you for your input. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Bester\u300d</p><br/><p>I said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, not at all!\u201d Bright red, Bester replied with a beaming smile.</p><br/><p>Sorry, honestly, that\u2019s damn creepy.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gotten rid of that sharp personality and mellowed out\u2026 but he really is just an old man.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, before I forget. On my journey to the Dwarf Kingdom, how much can I report?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, as much as you want. They might have a useful opinion\u300d</p><br/><p>I gave my permission.</p><br/><p>Even if we hide it, they\u2019d find out eventually. So we might as well be honest from the start.</p><br/><p>I thanked the bashful Bester again and had him leave.</p><br/><p>That guy, maybe he\u2019s not bashful but just fascinated by me\u2026</p><br/><p>I had taken my human form half way through the conversation.</p><br/><p>And, I\u2019m not wearing the mask since it\u2019s in the middle of repairs right now.</p><br/><p>No way\u2026 is he a lolicon? A terrifying possibility filled my mind.</p><br/><p>I pray that\u2019s not the case!</p><br/><p>I think about our earlier conversation.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s how it is, letting the king and the messengers go is the best choice\u2026 maybe.</p><br/><p>I still have the unique skill\u300eHeartless One\u300fas well.</p><br/><p>Their hearts have been broken long ago so they can no longer betray me.</p><br/><p>When I though that,</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement. Unique Skill\u300eHeartless One\u300fhas been absorbed by ultimate skill\u300eBeelzebub\u300f</p><br/><p>Therefore, it has been erased and is currently unusable\u226b</p><br/><p>O-oh\u2026</p><br/><p>Just when I thought I have gotten a useful skill.</p><br/><p>To only use it once\u2013for what purpose did I acquire it? Well, I did think that I didn\u2019t need it, though.</p><br/><p>So that aside.</p><br/><p>I feel that the skills that I have gotten used to have greatly changed.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a need to verify this. For some reason, I felt that urgent need.</p><br/><p>Well, maybe we should release the king and the messenger, but that\u2019s something to discuss among all of us.</p><br/><p>I left the 12 Blood Shadows to Shion.</p><br/><p>After knocking some information out of them, she\u2019ll probably have me eat another one of her meals.</p><br/><p>Using the\u300eCook\u300fskill that she has recently obtained.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t she know that she doesn\u2019t have to feed me? Thats sickening\u2026 you know?</p><br/><p>Having thus decided our next steps, I had Rigurdo schedule a meeting.</p><br/><p>A conference of all department heads.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I decided to do.</p><br/><p>That being so, there\u2019s one more problem to solve.</p><br/><p>I look Rigurdo in the eyes,</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is it? Investigation going fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>I ask.</p><br/><p>Not just my skills, but every single monster\u2019s abilities have greatly increased along with my evolution.</p><br/><p>They were told by the \u201cVoice of the World\u201d about the gifts they were to receive.</p><br/><p>Those with a relation to me probably includes every monster I have named.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo nodded,</p><br/><p>\u300cWe are still in the middle of surveying the population.</p><br/><p>The women have been saying some incomprehensible things like their skin getting smooth and pretty or something.</p><br/><p>Their vitality has certainly increased.</p><br/><p>Those specialized in combat have acquired individual skills and squad unity skills.</p><br/><p>Interestingly enough, the Goblin Riders and the Star Wolves have acquired the rare extra skill\u300eUnification\u300f\u300d</p><br/><p>Extra skill\u300eUnification\u300fmeans exactly what it sounds like, no hidden meaning here.</p><br/><p>They became as if one being, able to move quickly on all fours and get a boost of strength.</p><br/><p>Their strength puts them at about rank A-. Even the worst among them would dominate the B ranked.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, all one hundred have this skill.</p><br/><p>Rigurdo\u2019s report continues.</p><br/><p>Among the 100 resurrected\u2013the children have all evolved into adolescents.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this evolution was inspired by their regret at being unable to fight.</p><br/><p>They have all obtained\u300ePerfect Memory EX\u300fand\u300eEndless Regeneration EX\u300fskills.</p><br/><p>Though these are merely extra skills, they work well together.</p><br/><p>That is, even if their heads get blown off, they can change into astral body state and thus avoid death.</p><br/><p>In other words, they obtained regenerative abilities equal to that of Orc Disaster.</p><br/><p>And there\u2019s a hundred of them. How absurd.</p><br/><p>Thus, along with Shion, who got carried away obtaining this absurd ability, they have been calmly enduring intensive training.</p><br/><p>I mean, we won\u2019t die! The boys and girls of the city told me\u2026</p><br/><p>I have no words.</p><br/><p>Should I reprimand them or tell them to work hard?</p><br/><p>Though they are only C+ ranked at most right now, I have a feeling that they will become our strongest squad yet.</p><br/><p>They have even named their squad \u201cYomigaeri\u201c\u2013those who have surpassed death.</p><br/><p>The 4,100 hobgoblins under Benimaru\u2019s command have evolved in an interesting way.</p><br/><p>The strongest among them, 100 men, evolved into Ogres.</p><br/><p>Just as the oni had wanted, probably; these ogres belong to the first village I had saved.</p><br/><p>They are now Benimaru\u2019s personal bodyguards, and have been named \u201cKurenai\u2018 (Crimson). They possess rank A- strength.</p><br/><p>And, as our vanguards with\u300eFire Manipulation\u300fand\u300eThermal Resistance EX\u300fskills, the rest of the hobgoblins are thus our fire squad.</p><br/><p>Though they are still ranked C+, they are surprisingly powerful.</p><br/><p>I had named them the Green Corps, but that\u2019s no good following the evolution.</p><br/><p>That is, as Benimaru\u2019s subordinates, the red suits them\u2026</p><br/><p>The name \u201cgreen\u201d doesn\u2019t, however. My failure to think ahead led to this.</p><br/><p>But hey, no need to think that far!</p><br/><p>Monster evolution is unpredictable.</p><br/><p>So in defiance, I had the Green Corps\u2019 equipment dyed emerald.</p><br/><p>In the first place, color has no effect on their ability to freely manipulate fire.</p><br/><p>The high orcs evolved as a herd.</p><br/><p>They all obtained\u300eIron Wall EX\u300fskill that allows them to create a protective wall out of earth.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they also obtained\u300eFull Body Armor\u300fdefense ability.</p><br/><p>The inherited most of my resistances, noting that Physical Attack Resistance includes\u300ePain, Corrosion, Paralysis, Electricity\u300fresistances.</p><br/><p>So, if I have them eat a lot of Shion\u2019s cooking, would they acquire poison resistance? What foolish thing I thought!</p><br/><p>Though there are individual differences, there are no problems as a whole.</p><br/><p>They each can be evaluated as B ranked.</p><br/><p>And this is when they have lived up to their \u201cYellow Corps\u201d name.</p><br/><p>A squad specializing in creating walls to ward off attacks. They are Tempest\u2019s main force.</p><br/><p>As for Gabil\u2019s 100 Dragonewts,</p><br/><p>Of course, they are at least ranked A- each.</p><br/><p>They acquired\u300eDragon Knight Transformation\u300fand\u300eFlame Breath\u300for\u300eThunder Breath\u300fabilities.</p><br/><p>Though their efficiency dropped, their power greatly increased.</p><br/><p>Honestly, I still don\u2019t really know what\u300eDragon Knight Transformation\u300fdoes. Though they obtained it, they can\u2019t seem to use it yet.</p><br/><p>I have a bad feeling about it, so maybe that\u2019s a good thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo just use it when you\u2019re in danger!\u201d is pure negligence.</p><br/><p>Such a phrase is almost sacrilegious to Gabil and his troops.</p><br/><p>But to think that they have also acquired flying abilities and can now shoot their breath from the sky\u2026</p><br/><p>Though they haven\u2019t obtained any new resistances, they did have high resistance to begin with.</p><br/><p>With their scale armor being strong as steel.</p><br/><p>Only a direct strike could penetrate their armor.</p><br/><p>So being able to fly puts them at an overwhelming advantage over their enemies.</p><br/><p>Their name, \u201cHiryu\u201d (Flying Dragons).</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they currently might be our strongest unit.</p><br/><p>And thus the report continued.</p><br/><p>Seems like my efforts up till now truly paid off.</p><br/><p>All I got from that was: our strength greatly increased. Just that.</p><br/><p>Though we are not even ten thousand strong, we can easily crush larger armies.</p><br/><p>Compared to the one I annihilated, we are overwhelmingly stronger.</p><br/><p>You know, I\u2019m not even surprised anymore.</p><br/><p>Our only weakness is our small numbers.</p><br/><p>Since we can\u2019t easily increase our numbers, that will cause us problems from now on.</p><br/><p>Thus we concluded surveying the populace.</p><br/><p>Next up: management\u2026</p><br/><p>According to Rigurdo, they are not yet certain.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s just how it should be.</p><br/><p>Even I am not yet completely aware of my abilities.</p><br/><p>Rather than worrying about others, it\u2019s best to worry about yourself first.</p><br/><p>Requesting that Rigurdo continue the investigation, I left the place to verify my abilities.</p><br/><p>I headed straight to the Cave of the Seal.</p><br/><p>Meeting Gabil on the way, I ordered that no one intrude, and entered the cave.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s call forth ultimate skill\u300eRaphael\u300f</p><br/><p>I ordered that it teach me about the changes that occurred as the result of the evolution.</p><br/><p>Here\u2019s what I found.</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Demon Slime</p><br/><p>Blessing: Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Title: \u201cDemon Lord\u201d</p><br/><p>Magic:\u3008Magic Energy Manipulation Archive\u3009\u3008Great Spirit Summoning\u3009</p><br/><p>\u3008Great Demon Summoning\u3009</p><br/><p>Skills: Species-skill\u300eDecomposition Absorption, Endless Regeneration\u300f</p><br/><p>Ultimate Skill\u300eWisdom King Raphael\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026Though Acceleration\u30fbAppraisal\u30fbParallel Processing\u30fb</p><br/><p>Chant Annulment\u30fbAll of Creation\u30fbFusion\u30fbSeparation</p><br/><p>Ultimate Skill\u300eGluttonous King Beelzebub\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026Predation\u30fbAnalysis\u30fbStomach\u30fbMimic\u30fbSegregation\u30fb</p><br/><p>Decomposition\u30fbSupply\u30fbFood Chain\u30fbSoul Eater</p><br/><p>Daily Skills\u2026\u300eMagic Perception\u300f\u300eHeat Detection\u300f\u300eAuditory</p><br/><p>Perception\u300f\u300eSuper Olfaction\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eDemon Lord\u2019s Ambition\u300f</p><br/><p>Battle Skills\u2026\u300eThread Manipulation\u300f\u300eCloning\u300f\u300eChaos Breath\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eLaw Manipulation\u300f\u300eAttribute Change\u300f\u300eThought</p><br/><p>Domination\u300f\u300eDemon Lord Transformation\u300f</p><br/><p>Mimic: Demon, Spirit, Black Wolf, Black Snake, Centipede, Giant Bat, Giant</p><br/><p>Spider, Lizard, Goblin, Orc</p><br/><p>Resistances: Physical Damage Nullification, Natural Attack Nullification, Status</p><br/><p>Change Nullification</p><br/><p>Spirit Attack Resistance, Holy Magic Resistance</p><br/><p>That is all.</p><br/><p>A bunch of things seemed to have disappeared, but since I am in the middle of receiving the skills that my allies acquired, I should be able to use many more.</p><br/><p>I had thought that only the name changed for many of these, but I was clearly wrong.</p><br/><p>Thought Acceleration, for example, has now increased to 1,000,000 times as fast.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t explain it in words very well\u2026 when I used it, time seemed to stop.</p><br/><p>While intending to ask Raphael about each skill,</p><br/><p>\u226aAnnouncement.

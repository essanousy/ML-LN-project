Just some light punishment the idiot who dared being rude to my benefactor Rimuru-danna.\u300d</p><br/><p>He replied while pointing at Minister Bester who was being nursed by four soldiers.</p><br/><p>Bester, on the other hand, was so shocked and surprised that he couldn\u2019t even stand.</p><br/><p>Blood was dripping from his nose, he glared stupidly at me.</p><br/><p>Not even in his wildest dreams had he imagined being punched. Thus, he was so surprised, that he probably didn\u2019t even feel the pain.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi oi\u2026 \u201cjust some light punishment\u201d\u2026? Making an enemy of the minister is very bad\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaidou muttered with a foreboding sigh.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnyways\u2026 I\u2019ll have to restrain the people present.\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, and gave his subordinates an order.</p><br/><p>But, only audible to us, he added,</p><br/><p>\u300cWe won\u2019t harm you, so please come peacefully!\u300d</p><br/><p>He mumbled.</p><br/><p>Of course, I had no intention of causing further trouble.</p><br/><p>Thus, moving towards Mama-san, I handed her five gold coins.</p><br/><p>And, in reply to her surprise,</p><br/><p>\u300cI included the inconvenience fee! I\u2019ll be back!\u300d</p><br/><p>Such were my salutations.</p><br/><p>This is a good shop, and I\u2019d be very upset if I could no longer come here.</p><br/><p>That is how we were being escorted away by the soldier\u2026 aren\u2019t we forgetting something?</p><br/><p>Right! We forgot Gobuta.</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t bring that idiot to the shop.</p><br/><p>In any case, that foolish action seems to have earned Kaijin the punishment in the \u201cPsychidae Hell\u201d.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d thought they\u2019d hang him upside down or something, so this seems bad.</p><br/><p>Which is why, I wrapped Gobuta up with [Sticky Thread] and hung him from the ceiling.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait! That\u2019s heartless! Take me there, too!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>And though he cried out similar grief-stricken phrases, hoping that we\u2019d listen.</p><br/><p>But to these words,</p><br/><p>\u300cIdiot! Your actions have their own consequences! If you don\u2019t like it, just summon up the rest (storm fang wolves)!\u300d</p><br/><p>We left him with hanging there with, what we thought, was an impossible task.</p><br/><p>Anyways, the goblins, or rather the hobgoblins, should be fine even if they receive no food or water for a week.</p><br/><p>Though if it the confinement continues any longer, we\u2019ll have to break out and save Gobuta.</p><br/><p>And having so decided, I forgot about him for the time being.</p><br/><p>My conscience did ask \u201cIsn\u2019t this too pitiful?\u201d, but he\u2019s a sturdy guy! He\u2019ll be fine!</p><br/><p>So the five of us were brought into the royal palace.</p><br/><p>But I may have exaggerated a bit\u2013we weren\u2019t restraint with much force. Felt more like we were coming voluntarily. Well, were coerced into doing so\u2026</p><br/><p>As a result, we spent two days in prison.</p><br/><p>Or so I\u2019d like to call it, but we received good food and the room was amicably furnished.</p><br/><p>All five were placed in the same place, so rather than a prison, it was just a big room.</p><br/><p>Their treatment of us was also relatively pleasant.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy short temper got you in this mess\u2026 forgive me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kaijin came over to apologize.</p><br/><p>However, no one gathered here particularly minded in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u300cKaijin-san, we\u2019re fine! Don\u2019t sweat it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cExactly. Don\u2019t worry about it, pops!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026.!.\u300d</p><br/><p>The three seemed to be of the same opinion.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat aside, once we\u2019re freed, we intend to come along with Kaijin-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-danna, would our presence be a bother?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026??\u300d</p><br/><p>The third also seemed like he wanted to say something, but as I clearly lack the power to understand, I was just happy with the sentiment.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright! I guess I\u2019ll say it again: you\u2019ll be in my care! However, I plan to work you hard, so be prepared!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cYeah!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>And, well, that\u2019s the kind of discussion we had.</p><br/><p>The first day had thus passed, and on the second night,</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, about that Cabinet Minister, he really seemed to hate Kaijin, didn\u2019t he? Is there a reason for that?\u300d</p><br/><p>I nonchalantly asked.</p><br/><p>But hearing this, Kaijin grimaced, and began his tale.</p><br/><p>So apparently Kaijin used to be one of the captain\u2019s of the royal knights.</p><br/><p>That is, there are seven platoons among the royal knights, with each having their own captain.</p><br/><p>Construction Platoon, Commoner Platoon, Emergency Relief Platoon.</p><br/><p>Heavy Armament Platoon, Magic Assault Platoon, Magic Support Platoon.</p><br/><p>And, the most important, the King\u2019s personal Royal Guard.</p><br/><p>Kaijin served as the captain of the construction platoon.</p><br/><p>His aide at the time, was none other than Bester.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat guy, was from a family of a Marquess, and they say he bought his status with gold\u2026 Thus he was jealous of me, who was a commoner born of commoners.</p><br/><p>Must have been difficult, I imagine. Receiving orders from a mere commoner must have been very disgraceful.</p><br/><p>I, myself, did not try to be considerate of my subordinates\u2019 feelings. I just desperately tried to please his Majesty\u2026</p><br/><p>And then, that incident occurred\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Having so it introduced, he continued to discuss that incident.</p><br/><p>An incident that resulted in Kaijin leaving the army.</p><br/><p>Magic Battle Gear Incident.</p><br/><p>At the time, the construction platoon had no new inventions and was evaluated the worst among the seven platoons.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a nation founded on technological progress, the Construction Platoon should be flourishing!\u201d So claimed Bester\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, we should carefully continue our research!\u201d So claimed Kaijin\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>The arguments fueled further rivalry, and debates never produced any results.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they did have a joint project with the Elves on the \u201cMagical Battle Gear\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must succeed with this project and forever establish our name!\u201d was what Bester thought.</p><br/><p>As a result of his independent and rash action, the \u201cDemonic Sorcery Core\u201d had gone out of control, and the project halted indefinitely.</p><br/><p>Had they carefully assembled the most talented group, the \u201cMagic Battle Gear\u201d project would not have met such an end!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In conclusion, Kaijin took the blame, and left the army.</p><br/><p>As for Bester, he was so desperate to push his failure on Kaijin, that he had forged military records and planted other false evidence.</p><br/><p>In short, Bester is a stereotypical villain. And in some sense, he\u2019s easy to understand.</p><br/><p>So to summarize, \u201cKaijin was waiting for the time the country would need him and would immediately jump at the opportunity to come back, without realizing that it would cause him harm!\u201d\u2013that kind of story?</p><br/><p>But really, wouldn\u2019t the death penalty suit cowardly bastards like Bester the best? Well, maybe the death penalty would be going too far.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, in any case, with my departure, maybe even he can finally relax.\u300d</p><br/><p>Those words ended his tale.</p><br/><p>After hearing about the incident, the three brothers also seem to have started to hate the Minister.</p><br/><p>Well, such a story will make even me hate him.</p><br/><p>However, he did hit a noble.</p><br/><p>It would be strange for him to leave without any trouble.</p><br/><p>And in response to my worries,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt should be fine, probably. Although retired, my position as a captain did earn me the rank of Baronet.</p><br/><p>Had it been a case of a commoner hitting a noble, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid the death penalty!\u300d</p><br/><p>Having said that, he laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t laugh at all, though\u2026</p><br/><p>If worst comes to worst, we\u2019re breaking out! As for the completely unrelated person\u2013me, I\u2019ll just pretend to be a normal slime until things quiet down.</p><br/><p>So I silently thought</p><br/><p>And, the day of the trial came.</p><br/><p>We were lead before the king.</p><br/><p>The dwarfs\u2019 Hero King.</p><br/><p>Though in front of him, you couldn\u2019t feel that overpowering aura.</p><br/><p>The current king\u2013Gazelle Dwargo.</p><br/><p>With his eyes closed, he sits deeply on the throne.</p><br/><p>Looking like a typical dwarf, he had a sturdy build. His armor concealed his excessive energy.</p><br/><p>Though he could easily be distinguished by his darker skin, and jet black hair, swept back.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s strong!</p><br/><p>Been a while since my instincts last cried out in alarm.</p><br/><p>To both of his sides, the knights stand at attention.</p><br/><p>Though I feel that those two are strong as well, they seem dull in comparison to the king.</p><br/><p>As that guy is just a monster.</p><br/><p>I had planned to run away if needed, but with this\u2026</p><br/><p>His mere presence forced my distracted mind to focus.</p><br/><p>This was probably the first time I felt danger in this world.</p><br/><p>There was one man kneeling before the king as if confirming something.</p><br/><p>Having received the king\u2019s permission, he stood, and,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe trial shall now begin! Silence your voices!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He informed us of its beginning.</p><br/><p>Taking up an hour, both sides\u2019 stories were presented.</p><br/><p>The parties in question\u2013ourselves\u2013were not permitted to speak.</p><br/><p>The only ones who could freely speak are nobles rank \u201cCount\u201d and above.</p><br/><p>The rest, must wait for the king\u2019s explicit permission.</p><br/><p>If I had to speak, what would I say?</p><br/><p>Speak out of turn, and your guilt shall be confirmed. Moreover, we\u2019ll also include a free \u201cInsult the King\u201d special!</p><br/><p>Even if the charges against you were false, the rules stay the same.</p><br/><p>No choice but to leave everything to your representative.</p><br/><p>That representative, these past two days, has shown his face many times.</p><br/><p>If I had to say, he\u2019s kind of like our lawyer.</p><br/><p>I wonder if he\u2019s any good?</p><br/><p>Those kind of worries tend to prove true too often\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThus, in this way, the drunk and relaxed Bester-dono, while making his way into another shop, was assaulted!</p><br/><p>Such action must not be pardoned easily!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that the truth?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy! I, more than listening to Kaijin-dono, have investigated with the shop owners!</p><br/><p>All my previous statements are, in fact, completely true!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Huh? Umm\u2026 what did he say?</p><br/><p>Someone we thought to be our ally had unexpectedly betrayed us?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this\u2026 bad?</p><br/><p>When I look at Kaijin\u2019s face, it first turned bright red, but slowly paled.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s to be expected.</p><br/><p>I mean, he can\u2019t even complain.</p><br/><p>Oh and by the way\u2026 the representative is not allowed to lie.</p><br/><p>If his lies get revealed, he gets the death penalty. So without some extreme circumstances, to lie is unthinkable\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus the system that forbids those of lower birth (in this case, the accused) to speak in front of the king, is being abused in the worst of ways.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour Majesty! Have you heard enough? Please bestow a harsh punishment on them!\u300d</p><br/><p>High with excitement, Bester proposes thus to the king.</p><br/><p>Moreover, while looking at us, he shows a triumphant smile.</p><br/><p>That bastard\u2026 I really should have clobbered him\u2026</p><br/><p>The king, with his eyes closed, refuses to move a muscle.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, those close by announce his decision.</p><br/><p>\u300cSilence!!! We shall now announce the verdict!</p><br/><p>Assailant, Kaijin! You are sentenced to 20 years of forced labour in the mines.</p><br/><p>The rest, accomplices! You are sentenced to 10 years of forced labour in the mines.</p><br/><p>That, concludes this\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>A deep, heavy voice resounded through the hall.</p><br/><p>The king opened his eyes and looked at Kaijin.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s been a while, Kaijin! Are you in good health\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Ay! More importantly, I am happy to see his Majesty in good health!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus answered Kajin.</p><br/><p>Seems like answering the King\u2019s questions is allowed.</p><br/><p>\u300cEnough. Those with you are the real question! Do you have intention of returning to service?\u300d</p><br/><p>The hall immediately filled with noise.</p><br/><p>Bester\u2019s face turned blue.</p><br/><p>The representative who betrayed us, turned deathly pale.</p><br/><p>\u300cI fear, your Majesty, I already have a master!</p><br/><p>That pledge has become this one\u2019s treasure. This treasure, even if it be his Majesty\u2019s order, I shall never part with!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Angry words resounded in return.</p><br/><p>The Royal Guard directed their killing intent at Kaijin.</p><br/><p>Even then, Kaijin faced the king without a hint of fear, but rather with grand price.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the king closed his eyes again.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs, that so\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Having so muttered,</p><br/><p>He ordered his attendant to call silence again.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll declared the verdict. Steel your hearts!!!</p><br/><p>Kaijin and company, I deport you from the kingdom.</p><br/><p>You shall not be permitted to remain here even a single night longer.</p><br/><p>That is all. Now, begone from my sight\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The king opened his eyes wide and so proclaimed.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the air of the king!</p><br/><p>Intimidating enough to make my body tremble.</p><br/><p>But even so\u2026 the king looked rather lonely to me.</p><br/><p>And thus, with the conclusion of the trial, we returned to Kaijin\u2019s store.</p><br/><p>Just went for a little drink, but it became such an incident.</p><br/><p>Now then, we need to quickly pack, and set off!</p><br/><p>And speaking off\u2026 is Gobuta alright?</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 only three days had passed\u2026</p><br/><p>With some worry in my heart, we opened the \u201cpunishment room\u201d, and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! You have returned! Was it fun? Next time, please bring me along!\u300d</p><br/><p>Waking on top of the sofa, Gobuta said these word.</p><br/><p>What\u2026 the hell?</p><br/><p>How did he break free from the [Sticky Thread]?</p><br/><p>If I look closely\u2026 what I thought was a pillow as a storm wolf.</p><br/><p>Really? He really summoned them?!</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, oi, Gobuta-kun. You, were able to summon the wolves?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah! I was! \u201cPlease come!\u201d I called, and they came!\u300d</p><br/><p>He makes it sound too easy.</p><br/><p>No hobgoblin had succeeded with summons up until now.</p><br/><p>Maybe\u2026 did nutrient deprivation awaken some latent ability?</p><br/><p>Nah\u2026 no way. That\u2019s impossible for Gobuta.</p><br/><p>Must have been just luck.</p><br/><p>And, that\u2019s when I noticed the petrified dwarf that had finally noticed the wolf.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you doing? Not going to prepare?\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked the dwarfs.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, oi, wait a second! Why is there a black fang wolf in here!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right! There\u2019s a B rank monster blocking our escape!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>They seem to be panicking.</p><br/><p>That was an interesting\u2026 a comical reaction.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine! No problem. No different from your average dog! I keep him at home!\u300d</p><br/><p>I had intended for those words to calm them, but they were struck speechless instead.</p><br/><p>Since we have no time, I couldn\u2019t waste any of it for explanation.</p><br/><p>So while having the dwarfs change into traveling gear, I chased the rest out.</p><br/><p>Remaining in the building, I began to absorb everything.</p><br/><p>Not even close to full capacity.</p><br/><p>But, I decided to refrain from absorbing the whole building, as that would probably get me arrested again.</p><br/><p>Thus, we had finished the preparations for our journey, and thus we headed towards the meeting spot.</p><br/><p>Militaristic State Dwargon.</p><br/><p>We\u2019d be involved with it many times from now on.</p><br/><p>But to us who were escaping from it, that kind of thing we could not even imagine.</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: the Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Titles: One who Commands Monsters</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Skills: Unique Skill [Great Sage], Unique Skill [Predator], Slime-Specific Skills [Dissolve, Absorb, Regenerate], Extra Skill [Water Manipulation], Extra Skill [Magic Perception], Acquired Skills: Black Serpent [Heat Detection, Noxious Breath], Centipede [Paralysis Breath], Spider [Sticky Thread, Steel Threat], Bat [Ultrasound Waves], Lizard [Body Armor], Wolf [Supreme Sense of Smell, Telepathic Communication, Intimidation, Shadow Step, Black Lightning]</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance EX, Physical Attack Resistance, Pain Resistance, Electricity Resistance, Paralysis Resistance</p><br/><p>\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>That place was wrapped in silence.</p><br/><p>To such extent, that you wouldn\u2019t believe it was ever noisy,</p><br/><p>Since the five criminals had been expelled from this hall, not a single person had moved.</p><br/><p>As if breaking the silence,</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, Bester. Is there anything you\u2019d like to say?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWi\u2026 with all due respect, your Majesty! This is a misunderstanding! There must be some mistake!\u300d</p><br/><p>Such was Minister Bester\u2019s unsightly appeal, that seemed to want to grab onto the king.</p><br/><p>In contrast, the King had showed no emotion, and remained stoic.</p><br/><p>\u300cA misunderstand, huh\u2026 that would have been losing a faithful minister.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you saying! I cannot fathom how come you believe that that man had sworn his loyalty to your Majesty\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBester! You are mistaken. The case with Kaijin had been lost long ago\u2026</p><br/><p>The faithful minister I had lost, is none other than you.\u300d</p><br/><p>A quiet voice revealing no emotion.</p><br/><p>Whereas Bester shrieked in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must come up with an excuse!\u201d He frantically thought.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t form a coherent thought.</p><br/><p>What had, the king, just said?</p><br/><p>The one he lost is\u2026 me? That means\u2026</p><br/><p>Bester wanted to come up with something. But no thoughts would form.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll ask again. Bester. Do you have anything left to say?\u300d</p><br/><p>Frightening.</p><br/><p>His head was filled with fear.</p><br/><p>I have to answer his question! He thought, but no words would come out!!!</p><br/><p>\u300cWith\u2026 with all\u2026 with all due respect\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEnough, I had expected more from you. I always waited. Even for you to come clean on the Magical Battle Gear Incident.</p><br/><p>But, even now\u2026 look!\u300d</p><br/><p>The King said pointing at two items.</p><br/><p>Sometime previously, an attendant had brought htem.</p><br/><p>Bester stared at them with empty eyes.</p><br/><p>Something he had never seen before, a liquid sphere wrapped in cloth.</p><br/><p>And a single longsword.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you know what this is?\u300d</p><br/><p>As he was asked, he carefully observed.</p><br/><p>The sphere he had not recognized, but the sword was the one that Kaijin always carried.</p><br/><p>\u300cThink!\u300d</p><br/><p>In place of the King, the attendant had explained.</p><br/><p>Bester\u2019s mind would require many more hours to understand the transpired.</p><br/><p>Not a revival pill, but a restoration pill made from Hipokte grass. That of complete restoration.</p><br/><p>With dwarven technology, the best they could achieve was a purity of 98%.</p><br/><p>At 98%, it would never have the effect of high grade medicine. But this, was at 99%!!!</p><br/><p>Bester\u2019s face lit up in surprise. He wanted to know the extraction method.</p><br/><p>But what should have surprised bester more was the longsword.</p><br/><p>The demon ore used in the blades had begun to adapt itself to the user, so was reported.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible\u2026 it normally takes ten years for that to happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bester, in shock, was beset by such thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that is true!\u201d such was the thought that dominated his mind.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe one who had produced these items was the slime. Thanks to your efforts, we no longer have a connection to the slime. Do you have anything to say for yourself?\u300d</p><br/><p>Bester knew all too well the depth of the King\u2019s anger.</p><br/><p>There was nothing else he could say\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cNothing\u2026 I have nothing to say, your Majesty.\u300d</p><br/><p>Tears welled up within him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had been abandoned by the king!\u201d He finally understood.</p><br/><p>He had just wanted to be of use to the king. And to be recognized.</p><br/><p>That was his with, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>Since when did he go wrong?</p><br/><p>Was it when he got jealous of Kaijin?</p><br/><p>Or was it well before then?</p><br/><p>That he did not know. All that he knew what that he betrayed the king\u2019s expectations. That sole truth.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs, that so. Then, Bester! You are forbidden from entering the kingdom ever again. Never show yourself before me from now on</p><br/><p>However, I\u2019ll leave you some parting words\u2026 You have served well!!!.\u300d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the king\u2019s words, Bester responded with a deep bow.</p><br/><p>And thus left the hall.</p><br/><p>To repay the foolish act he had committed\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time as Bester left,</p><br/><p>The guards restrained his accomplice, the treacherous representative.</p><br/><p>That he saw from the corner of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cSpies! Keep watch over the slime! Never let him leave your sight! EVER!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The king had raised his voice so to give this order.</p><br/><p>That usually quiet king, to raise his voice!</p><br/><p>Everyone tensed at the gravity of the order.</p><br/><p>\u300cEven at the cost of our lives!\u300d</p><br/><p>The spies having so replied, disappeared.</p><br/><p>The king pondered thus.</p><br/><p>What was that monster?</p><br/><p>That was a unique creature. Letting him loose upon the world\u2026</p><br/><p>Will probably end our peace\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

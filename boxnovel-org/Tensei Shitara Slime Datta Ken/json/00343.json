Before any of them could put their feelings into action.</p><br/><p>The attack.</p><br/><p>There was an explosive sound as the ceiling of the underground shelter, that was the resistance\u2019s base, collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza shouted as he frantically looked up towards the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Black smoke rose into the air. He could see the grey sky between the cracks.</p><br/><p>He was stunned.</p><br/><p>Sharma ignored him and was the first to react.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad! The toxic fumes will come in!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharma shouted. Rindo quickly moved.</p><br/><p>He gathered together the adults and children and led them to the lower floors that were used as an emergency refuge.</p><br/><p>As they had trained for such an event in the past, they moved with impressive speed.</p><br/><p>Only the youngest of the children cried or screamed.</p><br/><p>But for the most part, everyone disappeared from the top floor without much in the way of chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can\u2026but this is a shelter that withstood a nuclear blast\u2026!? What kind of power would it have taken to pierce through to here\u2026no\u2013is it a Bunker Buster!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza was frozen with shock.</p><br/><p>If he was right about it, this meant that the Empire was finally putting its full weight behind the attacks.</p><br/><p>And they had been the first to strike. There was now a danger of them all being slaughtered down here.</p><br/><p>However, Zaza had one doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No, wait a minute\u2026 If that really was a Bunker Buster, this floor would be a sea of scorching heat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And yet the blast seemed to have stopped as soon as it hit their ceiling.</p><br/><p>Zaza was so puzzled that he said this out loud.</p><br/><p>Veldora looked at him and smirked.</p><br/><p>After all, it had been Veldora\u2019s power that had saved them right now.</p><br/><p>He had just become popular with the people, and he wasn\u2019t about to let these intruders interfere with that. That is what was on Veldora\u2019s mind when he cast a barrier around this floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cKekehehehe. Oh, Zaza. As for that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the time to show that confused Zaza how wonderful he really was\u2013it was just as Veldora thought this and began to explain, that it happened.</p><br/><p>Five mobile weapons dropped down from the opening in the ceiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster. Something just came in!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk. How much must they pester me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora said in frustration.</p><br/><p>Even when he tried to be good, no one appreciated him. It happened all of the time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat shall we do, Lord Veldora?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Beretta. We\u2019ll do as we discussed. I shall protect Ramiris over here and you deal with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>They said casually, and then Beretta stepped forward to face the five enemies.</p><br/><p>Zaza saw this and frantically tried to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! Those things are dangerous! Judging by their silhouette\u2013they are the armored troops led by that bastard, Karman. I think he was a second lieutenant or sergeant, but he is also a highly experienced cyborg. He\u2019s insane. There are rumors of him annihilating several mercenary groups. You won\u2019t stand a chance against him if you\u2019re alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza knew Karman.</p><br/><p>How aggressive and cruel he was.</p><br/><p>There were mercenary groups that he knew personally who were destroyed by just a few of these mobile weapons.</p><br/><p>Some had been let go on purpose, and they all spoke with fear in their hearts.</p><br/><p>This man who was said to be the worst of the south was here in front of them.</p><br/><p>And so it was no surprise that Zaza was worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful now, Beretta!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill them, alright? I think Rimuru would get really angry if you did that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them showed no signs of having heard Zaza\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Zaza could not hide his alarm as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill them\u2026 Are you serious? What are you talking about!? I will admit that Mister Beretta is very strong, but these guys are not the same as Murder Dogs. They are real anti-army weapons! And there are five of them. We have no hope of winning. We have to escape now or we\u2019ll be wiped out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZaza. Calm down. I am here too. How could we lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what the hell do you think you\u2019re going to do!? They won\u2019t let you go just because you cooked them some okonomiyaki!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora had only been trying to calm Zaza down, but it had no effect.</p><br/><p>It could not be helped.</p><br/><p>After all, to him, Veldora was the least useful of the group.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? What you just said\u2026I\u2026that kind of hurt\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora was shocked by how little they thought of him.</p><br/><p>Ramiris tried to comfort him.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.\u2014And then.</p><br/><p>Leaving Veldora\u2019s stupid conversation behind him, Beretta faced Karman.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>The five mobile weapons advanced towards Beretta\u2013the Powered Suits, led by Second Lieutenant Karman\u2013but Beretta stood his ground.</p><br/><p>They had landed on the ground from above.</p><br/><p>As the ground shook when this happened, it was clear that they were quite heavy.</p><br/><p>They were at least three meters tall.</p><br/><p>Humanoid knights in heavy, thick armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cGiants?\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta whispered as he took a step forward.</p><br/><p>The machine that stood in the front addressed Beretta first.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Jackpot already, eh? So you must be the resistance\u2019s new weapon. The one that killed our Murder Dogs. I am Karman. A second lieutenant. I lead this troop.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was second lieutenant Karman.</p><br/><p>He held a cigar infused with emotion-suppressing agents. And he introduced himself while inhaling deeply.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

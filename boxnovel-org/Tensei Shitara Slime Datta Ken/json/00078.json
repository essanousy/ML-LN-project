Demon Lords</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Clayman was in an unprecedented state of panic.</p><br/><p>The humans were guided into action as planned.</p><br/><p>The result was supposed to be a bloodbath of a battle, filled with suffering and tragedy which his soul would reap and relish.</p><br/><p>However, the battle was concluded in an instant and all the souls were absorbed by a third-party.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t believe it, but the recent report confirmed it.</p><br/><p>This was a stage prepared by that honorable individual.</p><br/><p>A fight between monsters and humans that would lead Clayman into awakening as a True Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Thus, he hardly cared for his subordinate Myulan, and planned to dispose of her soon after.</p><br/><p>But he now lost connection with her. Moreover, her curse had been released and she was now free.</p><br/><p>This fact only added to his anxiety.</p><br/><p>But only that much was hardly a matter for concern.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he still has the strongest trump card known as Milim.</p><br/><p>Thus, he had forced Frey to schedule a Subjugation Council\u2013Walpurgis Banquet.</p><br/><p>As it had Milim\u2019s, Frey\u2019s, and his signature on it, it was quickly approved; there he wishes to call for an extermination of the presumptuous Slime who dared to call itself a demon lord and its city.</p><br/><p>Because marching his troops in the direction of human cities is strictly forbidden.</p><br/><p>At this Subjugation Council, he will first secure dominion over the other demon lords and then obtain the rights to invade the Monster Country, Tempest.</p><br/><p>While trampling every country along the way, of course.</p><br/><p>As for the high ranking devils of that country, he\u2019ll have Milim crush them.</p><br/><p>Were it a few days ago, he could have crushed them all himself, but due to their master\u2019s evolution, they all became devils and acquired greater power.</p><br/><p>At this point, Clayman lamented the fact that the first plan had failed.</p><br/><p>Well, he only had to rule over whoever remained after Milim was done with them.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly the shut-in demon lord Ramiris, requested that Slime Rimuru would be granted permission to attend.</p><br/><p>And strangely, he was given permission really quickly.</p><br/><p>Clayman tried to veto the request, of course, but, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, three other demon lords accepted it.</p><br/><p>Which caused all of Clayman\u2019s plans to fall apart.</p><br/><p>The Walpurgis Banquet that he so painstakingly gathered now was home to his enemies.</p><br/><p>Nor could he run away from it.</p><br/><p>If the slime himself came, even if Clayman called for a subjugation, the battle would occur at the Banquet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do? What should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clayman desperately sought a way out of this predicament.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>This desperation was observed by Frey who was smirking.</p><br/><p>What an unsightly man.</p><br/><p>Things were proceeding faster than she expected.</p><br/><p>Though she had not predicted this outcome, it was nonetheless to her favor.</p><br/><p>She looked at the expressionless Milim standing across from her,</p><br/><p>At her cute face\u2013completely void of any emotion,</p><br/><p>At her eyes, which suddenly looked elsewhere. At Frey.</p><br/><p>Frey nodded.</p><br/><p>(Yes, that\u2019s right. I understand, Milim)</p><br/><p>She responded in her mind, with a profound smile.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>(Clayman, you will live not much longer)</p><br/><p>Frey was secretly confirming theupcoming plan.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>In an unknown land, in the innermost burial chamber,</p><br/><p>In front of a coffin wrought of ice which sealed a beautiful naked girl with flowing black hair,</p><br/><p>Stood a being, themselves nude, beholding the coffin with a suspicious gaze.</p><br/><p>(Ah, how beautiful. Ah\u2026)</p><br/><p>Observing and adoring the coffin girl was this being\u2019s secret pastime.</p><br/><p>A silver haired cute girl.</p><br/><p>Her heterochromatic eyes glistened with a bizarre red and blue light.</p><br/><p>This, among her many strikingly beautiful features, was the most prominent one.</p><br/><p>But perhaps what garnered the most attention\u2026</p><br/><p>Were two pure teeth that peaked from within her small lips.</p><br/><p>When her small lips parted, they revealed a set of pure white fangs.</p><br/><p>She was the ruler of the night, Queen of Nightmares.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Ruminas Valentine.</p><br/><p>Even she, a vampire possessing the immense power of a demon lord, could not break the ice coffin.</p><br/><p>As it was not actually made of ice but was a pure lump of holy spirit energy.</p><br/><p>So even touching the coffin would leave burn like marks on her body.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Without any regard to this, she clung to the ice coffin.</p><br/><p>An invitation to attend Walpurgis Banquet reached this girl.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, many beings of comparable power would attend.</p><br/><p>Thus, she currently lacked the power to make them her enemies.</p><br/><p>Though this vexed her to no end, there was naught she could do.</p><br/><p>(Wait for me\u2026)</p><br/><p>She whispered the name of the adored girl, and left the chamber.</p><br/><p>And gathering a vast amount of magical energy, she submerged the chamber in darkness.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Two men were in the middle of a conversation.</p><br/><p>The first was a large, sturdy man clearly known for his height.</p><br/><p>The other was slovenly lying down, without a hint of dignity.</p><br/><p>However, as this was his usual appearance, the former paid it no mind.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, how long will you be staying here?</p><br/><p>Will you set off on another journey after the Walpurgis Banquet?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo clue~. What a pain. Nothing excites me anymore~\u300d</p><br/><p>To the large man\u2019s question, he replied without any motivation.</p><br/><p>But whichever\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cBut surely you have no choice but to participate in Walpurgis Banquet?</p><br/><p>So you might as well start considering what you will do afterwards\u300d</p><br/><p>The large man concluded.</p><br/><p>And looked at the vast sky above as if enjoying the view.</p><br/><p>Minutes passed silently between them,</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Dagrule, do your sons feel like becoming a demon lord?</p><br/><p>I can take them under my care, if you\u2019d like?\u300d</p><br/><p>The delicate man said as if he just remembered this idea.</p><br/><p>The large man\u2026 no, Dagrule closed his eyes for a minute and was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>One of the Giants, this demon lord is often referred to as \u201cContinent\u2019s Wrath\u201d.</p><br/><p>Normally a gentle man he finds the title unpleasant, but when angered he truly can\u2019t stop his hand.</p><br/><p>His power greatly increases when angered so he\u2019s a demon lord treated with utmost care.</p><br/><p>And his most closest friend, the delicate man, has never once angered him.</p><br/><p>To the delicate man\u2019s words,</p><br/><p>\u300cNah, they resemble me when I was young.</p><br/><p>They are rash, look down on everything, and believe that a being stronger than them does not exist.</p><br/><p>They would look down even on you, Dino\u300d</p><br/><p>He replied.</p><br/><p>The delicate man\u2019s name is Dino. A man of unknown race with an appearance no different than a human.</p><br/><p>But, he possess magical energy of such quantity that no human could possibly match.</p><br/><p>Though he is a handsome man, his sleepy gaze ruins his appeal.</p><br/><p>But he too is a demon lord. Called \u201cThe Wandering King\u201d or \u201cKing of the Sleeping Forest\u201d.</p><br/><p>Even now, he has left his home and is in the middle of a journey.</p><br/><p>And having used up all of his strength during the journey, he ended up in the care of his best friend Dagrule.</p><br/><p>In response to Dagrule\u2019s words,</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I don\u2019t mind. My worth wouldn\u2019t diminish from such a thing.</p><br/><p>But if they are so impudent, how about you bring them over?</p><br/><p>You have three sons, so I can bring one of them in my name?\u300d</p><br/><p>He said.</p><br/><p>Of course, he meant to take them to the Demon Lords\u2019 Walpurgis Banquet.</p><br/><p>Dagruel thought a bit on these words.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cCan I ask this of you? If they act foolish and die without coming to know true power, then that\u2019s that.</p><br/><p>So showing them true strength would be an excellent lesson\u300d</p><br/><p>He nodded.</p><br/><p>His three sons. Like him, they are a violent bunch.</p><br/><p>Agreeing to bring them, they continued the conversation with this in mind.</p><br/><p>However, bringing them there is much like starting a fire next to gun powder, but these two failed to recognize it as such.</p><br/><p>After all, both of them were particularly bad at careful planning.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>In a land covered by ice where fierce blizzards reigned,</p><br/><p>Proudly stood a tall castle.</p><br/><p>Its vicinity was covered in a barrier of ice, with temperatures of minus 120\u00b0 Celsius such that nothing could live there.</p><br/><p>And yet a beautiful castle adorned the land.</p><br/><p>Its presence testified to an unimaginable amounts of magical energy\u2013truly a castle of the highest demon.</p><br/><p>The Castle was named \u201cPalace of White Ice\u201d.</p><br/><p>And it was ruled by Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</p><br/><p>There was a being leisurely walking though the castle.</p><br/><p>Platinum Gold long hair, blue narrow eyes. A well defined face.</p><br/><p>Skin so white that it was almost transparent.</p><br/><p>He was so beautiful that he was surely mistaken for a woman.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Leon Cromwell. The one called the Blond Demon.</p><br/><p>He proceeded through the halls as if he owned them.</p><br/><p>Ahead of him was a door with beautiful carved decorations. It led to the audience chamber of the lord of the castle.</p><br/><p>Leon\u2019s purpose in attending was the lord of the castle, demon Lord Guy Crimson.</p><br/><p>Leon stood in front of the door, and the two large attendant demons opened it.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cDemon Lord Leon Cromwell-sama has arrived!\u300d</p><br/><p>A female-like demon announced the coming of Leon from above.</p><br/><p>On the inside, many powerful Greater Demons stood on the sides.</p><br/><p>Each was a named demon so greatly surpassed the power of a normal greater demon.</p><br/><p>There were over 200 of them in total.</p><br/><p>Named Greater Demons differ from normal ones as they possess a corporeal body in this world.</p><br/><p>So each could easily rival a high ranking devil.</p><br/><p>In other words, the room had 200 beings of a rank easily surpassing A.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not all\u2026</p><br/><p>At the end of the room, before the throne of Demon Lord Guy Crimson stood six demons of terrifying power.</p><br/><p>They were Named Arch demons.</p><br/><p>They battle power was surpassed any devil. These were pseudo-demon lord level demons.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>These six demon generals prevented any excessive word from going unpunished.</p><br/><p>Ruling over all of these as Demon Lord Guy Crimson\u2019s left and right hand were two demons.</p><br/><p>Having become \u201cDemon Officer\u201d these two women serve as the Demon Lord\u2019s spokesmen.</p><br/><p>They possess power that rivals that a demon lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Officer\u201d Mizari and \u201cDemon Officer\u201d Hirari.</p><br/><p>Leon proceeded further in and stood right below the throne.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s where Mizari and Hirari kneeled, and</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cLeon-sama, it has been a long time\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>At the same time they greeted Leon with a beautiful voice.</p><br/><p>And at the same moment, the Lord of the Castle stood up from his throne.</p><br/><p>Only the two demon lords now had the right to move within the room.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s been a while, my friend Leon. Have you been in good health?</p><br/><p>Let me thank you for coming over when I called you!\u300d</p><br/><p>A beautiful, projecting voice, deep crimson eyes which overshadowed the beauty of stars, hair flowing like fire, with a deeper red than the color of blood.</p><br/><p>Same height as Leon.</p><br/><p>Where Leon is as beautiful as a woman, Guy\u2019s beauty was more neutral.</p><br/><p>He could be called a woman or man; a bizarre physique.</p><br/><p>While calling out to him, he stood up from the throne and walked up to Leon.</p><br/><p>And after shaking Leon\u2019s hand, he gave him a hug.</p><br/><p>And without any hesitation, he placed his hand on Leon\u2019s face and kissed him.</p><br/><p>Leon pulled away with a scowl,</p><br/><p>\u300cStop it. I\u2019m not interested in dating men. How many times have I told you this already?\u300d</p><br/><p>He told him, treating it as a bother.</p><br/><p>\u300cA haha. Heartless as always.</p><br/><p>You know, if you ask, I\u2019ll become a woman?</p><br/><p>Ah whatever, let\u2019s move to a different room\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, and without waiting started walking.</p><br/><p>This happened every time.</p><br/><p>He was exposing a lot of skin while dressing in a kimono in this frigid land.</p><br/><p>Perhaps remembering the taste of Leon\u2019s lips, a lewd smile formed on his bewitching face.</p><br/><p>And he started to work his tongue around his red lips\u2026.</p><br/><p>That motion had a suspciously bewitching effect to it.</p><br/><p>Being androgynous, he could become a man or a woman at will.</p><br/><p>He\u2026 or perhaps she is Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</p><br/><p>The Lord of the Castle and the oldest Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Called the Lord of Darkness, he has forever ruled over this frozen continent.</p><br/><p>Guy proceeded onward showing Leon the way.</p><br/><p>Leon followed without any sign of worry.</p><br/><p>Until both of them left the audience chamber, not a single being had moved.</p><br/><p>As that would have been an unforgivable act.</p><br/><p>With their heads bowed low, they waited until their master and guest had left.</p><br/><p>Having confirmed their departure, Mizari and Hirari stood up.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cDisperse!\u300d</p><br/><p>They ordered their subordinates.</p><br/><p>As for them, they began to make tea for the guest.</p><br/><p>Among the highest beings of the castle, the job of these \u201cDemon Officials\u201d was nothing more than to care for Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</p><br/><p>And that job had the highest priority within the castle.</p><br/><p>So as to not earn the displeasure of their lord, they quickly got to work\u2026</p><br/><p>Leon followed Guy to the Ice Terrace on the highest floor.</p><br/><p>Even though it opens up to the outside, snow is not permitted entry.</p><br/><p>The environment is optimized for life.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Guy is not affected by the environment. In other words, the room is made for Leon\u2019s enjoyment.</p><br/><p>Though Guy normally looks down on any stranger, for his friends he spends both effort or expense.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like always,\u201d Leon thought, taking a seat.</p><br/><p>Though the chair he sat on was made of ice, he did not feel the cold.</p><br/><p>That too, was the routine.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo? Why have you called me?\u300d</p><br/><p>Forcefully flopping into the chair, Leon asked.</p><br/><p>When did they have time to prepare it is uncertain, but Hirari brought in tea.</p><br/><p>Mizari silently stood at the entrance to the terrace.</p><br/><p>That too she did without anybody noticing.</p><br/><p>They stood as to not intrude upon Guy\u2019s conversation, and so, did not address Leon.</p><br/><p>The girls were nothing more than tools, after all.</p><br/><p>Since they had nothing to do with this conversation, they were not permitted to even show an expression unless ordered to do so.</p><br/><p>So any motion that was not specifically ordered of them would lead to certain and quick death.</p><br/><p>In fact, even if Leon attacked Guy, they would not move.</p><br/><p>Guy was their supreme master, so worrying over his health was disrespectful.</p><br/><p>Thus, ignoring their existence, they continued their discussion.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh. You do know about the upcoming Walpurgis Banquet?</p><br/><p>I was thinking that if you couldn\u2019t attend this time, I\u2019d forcefully have you attend\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? You know I hate these gatherings?</p><br/><p>But I was planning on attending\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? Good, then. I had planned on having you make a clone and attend that way.</p><br/><p>I could have you embrace me then\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t take men for partners. Even among women I only go for the one I desire.</p><br/><p>For me to embrace you would be equivalent to some prize, wouldn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s with that? Tell me that earlier\u2026 If you wish for it, I\u2019ll become a woman for you.</p><br/><p>Whatever. So?</p><br/><p>Why did you decide to participate this time?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon made a brief pause, but then continued talking.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis time the banquet is hosted by Clayman. Small fry.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m curious why Milim is supporting him.</p><br/><p>And Karion\u2019s death is also suspicious.</p><br/><p>At first it was because Clayman wanted to spur us on a subjugation, but then Ramiris requested that the party in question attends.</p><br/><p>In other words, it\u2019s all connected.</p><br/><p>So I feel the need to see, this new Demon Lord \u201cRimuru\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh. So you believe Rimuru has the qualifications to be a demon lord, huh?</p><br/><p>How amusing, I thought the same thing.</p><br/><p>As for Milim, she\u2019s probably just playing around. No use trying to figure out what she\u2019s thinking.</p><br/><p>The wise one in me cannot understand fools. That might be a weakness.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s fine to ignore the opinion of someone like Clayman; Ramiris\u2019 opinion, on the other hand, seems promising.</p><br/><p>If she found someone interesting, maybe even I will enjoy myself.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Ramiris, huh? I\u2019m no good with her. From the very moment we met.</p><br/><p>I had thought to go and kill her a few times\u2026</p><br/><p>But since she mentioned it, I might as well go and see\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA hahaha. Don\u2019t. If you kill Ramiris, I\u2019ll be your enemy\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight. And I don\u2019t want to die yet. If you come at me, I see no chances for victory\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? Not at all. You have a one in a million chance of killing me, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen that\u2019s no good. I\u2019m only interested in fights that I can win\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStop with the humility. There\u2019s few people who can even hurt me.</p><br/><p>Having a chance to kill me means that you\u2019re strong. Have some confidence\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. I am confident. Against anyone other than you, that is.\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s where their conversation stopped,</p><br/><p>And without a moment passing,</p><br/><p>\u300cAra ara. Has your conversation finished?</p><br/><p>Leon-sama, I extend my humblest welcome\u300d</p><br/><p>A voice like ice.</p><br/><p>And it came from a beautiful white haired girl.</p><br/><p>Pure white skin, with cold and bewitching Blue Diamond colored eyes.</p><br/><p>And bright white lips.</p><br/><p>A girl walking around without Guy\u2019s permission.</p><br/><p>But she did not need his permission. In other words, she was their equal.</p><br/><p>\u201cIce Empress\u201d she was called, but is more known by her name \u201cIce Dragon Velzado\u201d.</p><br/><p>She is one of the four dragons, and Demon Lord Guy Crimson\u2019s first subordinate.</p><br/><p>Though rather than calling her a subordinate, it may be more appropriate to call her a partner.</p><br/><p>An existence far different than the tools.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy oh my, Velzatto. Beautiful as always\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAra? Even if it\u2019s only flattery, your words have made me happy\u300d</p><br/><p>A brief polite exchange.</p><br/><p>That revealed none of their real feelings.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. You guys are on bad terms as always\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy as well was vexed at their animosity.</p><br/><p>Normally, this would have led to an unpleasant exchange\u2026</p><br/><p>But this time, Velzatto changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, right. My \u201cbrother\u201d has awakened\u300d</p><br/><p>She suddenly declared.</p><br/><p>\u300cAwakened? The sealed \u201cStorm Dragon Valdora\u201d?</p><br/><p>I know that he was sealed, but didn\u2019t they say he had been erased?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. He had quieted down before disappearing, so I thought to help him out\u2026</p><br/><p>Being erased is pitiful, you know.</p><br/><p>He was trapped in an isolated space made by the hero that could not be influenced by the outside.</p><br/><p>Many beings have lost their lives swallowed by such barrier\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh\u2026 interesting.</p><br/><p>In that case, who could have dispelled this hero\u2019s seal?</p><br/><p>Unique skill \u201cEternal Prison\u201d, other than by other heroes, could not be dispelled by a normal skill.</p><br/><p>I have the \u2026 skill, and perhaps by your \u2026 skill.</p><br/><p>Well, we had planned to release him sooner or later.</p><br/><p>But considering that he has not rampaged since being released, does that mean he has weakened?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. He has. The response I am getting from him is strangely weak.</p><br/><p>But still, not rampaging is quite unlike him.</p><br/><p>His very being is made around the concept of violence, after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, in any case, I have no desire to fight Veldora.</p><br/><p>If you want to make him yours, do as you wish.</p><br/><p>Anyways, let\u2019s meet at the Walpurgis Banquet\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are leaving already?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. That\u2019s all you wanted from me, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, wait a second. No need to rush.</p><br/><p>By the way, have you succeeded with the \u201cSpecial Summoning\u201d yet?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Not yet.</p><br/><p>Frankly, I don\u2019t care much for new demon lords or what-not.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just, according to my sources, this one might be messing with my summoning tests\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? The one named Rimuru?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. So I want to at least see him once.</p><br/><p>But I\u2019ll be ignoring Ramiris, just so you know\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJust curious, but who\u2019s this informant?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo idea. Magic Energy is a important factor when summoning \u201cWorld Travelers\u201d.</p><br/><p>When I summon, since I try to narrow down the criteria as much as possible, the interval becomes much longer.</p><br/><p>At the present, I can only summon one being once every sixty six years.</p><br/><p>But since I need to narrow down the criteria even more, my next summoning attempt will be in ninety-nine years.</p><br/><p>This informant is trying out summoning in my place during this time\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow timid of you\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve failed many times, you see. Even after obtaining \u201cLuck Blessing\u201d from Ramiris, I couldn\u2019t succeed\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs this matter that important?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah\u2026 To me, it\u2019s more important than anything in the world\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. In that case, I won\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>But about this assistant\u2026 is he trustworthy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTrust? No way. But he does have some use\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. I know I don\u2019t need to say this, but do be careful\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not like you, Guy. But, I\u2019ll accept the warning.</p><br/><p>Thanks. Now then, let\u2019s meet at Walpurgis Banquet\u300d</p><br/><p>Leaving these words, Leon left,</p><br/><p>Leaving only a ball of light behind due to Spatial Movement magic.</p><br/><p>Seeing this,</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat an impatient man. Well, that\u2019s just like him\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy muttered while grimacing.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, he has created a dangerous opening.</p><br/><p>This unknown \u201cassistant\u201d\u2026 should I crush him?\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzatto asked with a cold voice,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t. Unnecessary actions will only earn Leon\u2019s displeasure.</p><br/><p>I have no desire to be hated by a friend\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy answered, unworried.</p><br/><p>To Guy, Leon was a trustworthy friend so these words were born out of familiarity with his personality.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he simply knew how powerful Leon\u2019s abilities were.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen he comes asking, we\u2019ll help him\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood\u300d</p><br/><p>And that conversation ended.</p><br/><p>Guy confirmed that his stay-at-home friend will be attending. Even though he was called out without a care for his needs, Leon seemed not to mind.</p><br/><p>Guy as well had ignored the summons a few times, but could not remember why.</p><br/><p>Thus, after a long time, all the demon lords will gather.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis banquet seems promising, will you come?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWill I\u2026 No, I won\u2019t.</p><br/><p>I have no interest in demon lords\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? Oh well. In that case, I leave the house-sitting to you\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. I\u2019ll make the necessary preparations\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzatto left after uttering these words.</p><br/><p>Guy, left behind, observed the aura of the icy continent, while thinking about the upcoming Walpurgis Banquet.</p><br/><p>A crafty demon lord prowling around.</p><br/><p>A small fry, signifying the weakening demon lords.</p><br/><p>A shut in friend who finally took action\u2013Guy found this point interesting.</p><br/><p>And, the birth of a new demon lord.</p><br/><p>How amusing. He had felt the loud beating of his heart for the first time in many hundreds of years.</p><br/><p>The last battle was between weaklings.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he could look forward to the upcoming one.</p><br/><p>With that thought, he started thinking about the hero.</p><br/><p>When was the last time he had felt one\u2026</p><br/><p>The one that invaded Leon\u2019s castle was also a hero.</p><br/><p>Leon ran away without fighting, claiming that the hero was strangely strong.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be strange for a human to die of old age by now, but Ramiris claimed that this hero was \u201cspecial\u201d.</p><br/><p>So it wouldn\u2019t be strange if it could extend its lifespan.</p><br/><p>Nor were its movements regular, appearing only before powerful individuals.</p><br/><p>Guy had never been able to meet the hero, but would have wanted to try fighting it once.</p><br/><p>This time\u2019s fight might be grand.</p><br/><p>It may not involve only monsters, but have the saints and the humans mixed in, resulting in a great calamity.</p><br/><p>So perhaps even a hero will appear.</p><br/><p>At this point, Guy had completely forgotten about the new demon lord.</p><br/><p>To him, demon lords were a trifling existence\u2026</p><br/><p>He desired to meet a hero. That thought brought a smile to his face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

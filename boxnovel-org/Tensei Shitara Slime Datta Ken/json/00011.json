Setting up wire traps and arrow slits, and manipulating the enemy into certain death! How terrifying!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Meh, could have been worse. For example, why didn\u2019t Rimuru try to coat the arrows in paralysis breath? Just imagine all those wolves falling down motionless only to be surrounded and slaughtered by the goblins!</p><br/><p>Clown: Well then, master strategist, how would you have dealt with the goblin fortification?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Set it on fire, of course. That, or try to gas them out. Though the best option by far would be to cut off their supplies and starve them out. Time is one\u2019s worst enemy during a siege.</p><br/><p>Clown: I see\u2026</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Speaking of time, have you even started drawing a banner with both of us on it?</p><br/><p>Clown: Huh? Umm, yeah! Totally! Like, it\u2019s almost done. Yep.</p><br/><p>Pierrot: You suck at lying.</p><br/><p>Clown: Hmm, is it the time for the daily joke? Alright, here\u2019s one\u2026 what animal keeps the best time? \u2026 A watch dog!</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Empowerment Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 11 \u2013 Evolving Monsters</p><br/><p>The wolves are showing no intentions to move.</p><br/><p>This could be bad\u2026</p><br/><p>Are they planning on rushing at me with a \u201cDeath rather than servitude!\u201d-like howl?</p><br/><p>Then it\u2019d become total war.</p><br/><p>They have no chance of victory, but we also wouldn\u2019t come out unscathed.</p><br/><p>Having come this far without injury\u2026 we\u2019d definitely win, but I\u2019d rather avoid further combat.</p><br/><p>Compared to earlier noise, an eerie silence fills the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The fang wolves are have all focused their sight on me.</p><br/><p>I slowly began to move.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll react to what I\u2019m about to do, but this is at least necessary for them to recognize the death of their leader.</p><br/><p>I approached the leader\u2019s corpse. No one moved to stop me.</p><br/><p>Nearby wolves took a step back.</p><br/><p>And then, I devoured the wolf leader using [Predation].</p><br/><p>That much is the right of the victor.</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cAnalysis has been completed.</p><br/><p>Ability to mimic the Fang Wolves has been acquired.</p><br/><p>Species-specific skills [Supreme Sense of Smell, Telepathic Communication, Coercion] have been acquired.\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>[Great Sage] reported in my mind.</p><br/><p>Alright.</p><br/><p>These guys\u2026 though they\u2019ve just seen their leader eaten, they aren\u2019t moving a muscle.</p><br/><p>Hmmm.</p><br/><p>Totally thought that they\u2019d either run away in panic or grovel in fear if I went this far\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh, right! I did say Servitude or Death\u2026</p><br/><p>Damn it\u2026 adrenaline rushed to my head, and this is the result.</p><br/><p>Well, only one thing to do. I guess I\u2019ll give them a way out.</p><br/><p>With that thought, I mimicked the Fang Wolf.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>*Guru, Uooooooooooon!!!*</p><br/><p>While activating [Coercion], I howled out.</p><br/><p>\u300cKukuku! Hear me! I\u2019ll let you off the hook this once. Those who would not obey, leave now!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>So I declared to the wolves.</p><br/><p>With this, even these mutts should have the courage to run.</p><br/><p>Or so I thought,</p><br/><p>(We as one, shall follow You!!!)</p><br/><p>They responded and knelt before me.</p><br/><p>Though honestly, they really look just like bunch of tired, sleepy dogs.</p><br/><p>In any case, they seem to have chosen servitude.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 when they were motionless\u2013they were busy discussing this?</p><br/><p>And with that, the battle of the Goblin Village had concluded.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Or so I\u2019d like to say, but it wasn\u2019t over yet!</p><br/><p>What came after\u2013reconciliation and repairs\u2013was far harder than the fight itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the hell ordered this house to be destroyed\u201d and the like\u2026</p><br/><p>What to do next? And, what to use for the goblins\u2019 beds?</p><br/><p>And, who\u2019ll walk the dogs\u2026</p><br/><p>Though many of them had died, there are still about eighty remaining.</p><br/><p>About that\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say the day is done! Leave all the thinking for tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Thus for now, I ordered the dogs to standby, and went to rest by the goblins\u2019 bonfire.</p><br/><p>Thus came morning.</p><br/><p>I thought all night, and finally came up with:</p><br/><p>\u201cMake the goblins look after the fang wolves!\u201d Plan.</p><br/><p>The goblin fighting force number seventy four members. No casualties from the battle.</p><br/><p>There were some scratches, but that\u2019s the extent of their injuries.</p><br/><p>Of the dogs, eighty one remain.</p><br/><p>There were many injured, but with immediate treatment, they have begun recovery.</p><br/><p>Even without further meddling, they\u2019ll heal nicely. That\u2019s how potent their recovery ability is.</p><br/><p>After waking up, I had the goblins line up.</p><br/><p>The kids and elderly wanted to sneak a peek, but with no houses around, they really stood out.</p><br/><p>The village chief was waiting by my side.</p><br/><p>He seems to intend to take care of me, which is nice and all\u2026 but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be happy getting an old goblin\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>That much is dictated by my aesthetic sense.</p><br/><p>That is, no matter how many times I reincarnate as a monster, my tastes I shall not yield!</p><br/><p>And, as cute things don\u2019t exist in this village, so I\u2019ll just have to give up for now.</p><br/><p>Then, I lined up the wolves in front of the goblins.</p><br/><p>Now, then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cSo\u2026. guys. From now on, I\u2019ll have you become a pair and proceed together\u300d</p><br/><p>I wait for their reaction.</p><br/><p>However, showing no intention of making noise, they simply await further instructions.</p><br/><p>No one seems particularly repulsed by the notion.</p><br/><p>This is going good, so far.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou get what I said, right? Make a group: one goblin and one wolf\u300d</p><br/><p>When I said that,</p><br/><p>The goblins and wolves sat by each other and exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cGuga!\u300d (Please take care of me!)</p><br/><p>\u300cGau!]\u300d(Likewise!)</p><br/><p>Is how quickly they got along.</p><br/><p>This is the \u201cYesterday\u2019s enemy is today\u2019s friend\u201d type of thing, I guess.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s when I got the thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are nameless, aren\u2019t they\u201d</p><br/><p>Calling out to them would be really inconvenient.</p><br/><p>And while glancing at the goblin-wolf pair,</p><br/><p>\u300cChief, it\u2019s really inconvenient to get your attention. So, I was thinking of giving you names. Would that be fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>Every head turned to me, and every eye focused on me, when I said that line.</p><br/><p>The same was true even for the civilians.</p><br/><p>\u300cWou\u2026 would you really bestow such honor on us?\u300d</p><br/><p>The head asked, overcome by awe.</p><br/><p>Hmm? What\u2019s with this excitement?</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yeah. If it\u2019s okay with you, I was planning on giving you names.\u300d</p><br/><p>The moment I finished the sentence, as if they were all holding their breath, the goblins shouted for joy.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s up with them?</p><br/><p>The situation is basically: GREAT EX-CIT-MENT!!!</p><br/><p>If they wanted names this much, they should\u2019ve just come up with ones\u2026.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how carefree I was then.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s start with the chief.</p><br/><p>First, I asked for his son\u2019s name. It was \u201cRigur\u201d.</p><br/><p>And so, I named the Chief \u201cRigur-do\u201d, Rigurdo.</p><br/><p>Not that the name had any specific meaning, I just thought it sounded good.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere his son around, I\u2019d call out to him \u201cRigur!\u201d and the chief would reply \u201cDo!\u201d\u2026\u201d When I said that as a joke, he suddenly got very serious.</p><br/><p>Moreover,</p><br/><p>\u300cTo have been honored with the name of my son, please permit these tears of gratitude!\u300d</p><br/><p>How much he exaggerates!</p><br/><p>To give him a name on a whim kind of makes me feel guilty\u2026</p><br/><p>But, oh well! And the feeling went away.</p><br/><p>Continuing, the Goblin Leader will succeed his brother\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>I could add \u201cthe 2nd\u201d to it, but it sounds like a pain. So, he\u2019s now \u201cRigur\u201d.</p><br/><p>And when he\u2019s called such, he falls prostate as if praying to me.</p><br/><p>Really, these guys take things too seriously\u2026 like father, like son, I guess.</p><br/><p>And while I\u2019m at it, might as well go through the parent-child groups first.</p><br/><p>Then, I named the single goblins and the orphans.</p><br/><p>I wonder if they guys will continue reusing these names in the future.</p><br/><p>With the birth of a grandchild, the chief will probably be called \u201cRigurdodo\u201d.</p><br/><p>And with a great grandchild, the infant will be called \u201cRigur\u201d and the chief \u201cRigurdododo\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Is what would be appropriate to say, then\u2026 but, oh well!</p><br/><p>And like that, I gave them names.</p><br/><p>Then, they said to me,</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, we have no words to express our gratitude\u2026 but are you sure that this was alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>The Chief\u2026 Rigurdo asked with a slightly flustered voice.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, well, we do know that Rimuru-sama possesses great magical energy\u2026 but, even so, to give out those many names at once\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s he talking about? I\u2019m just giving them a name\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? Well, no problem, I guess\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>And so, I continued giving out names.</p><br/><p>It seems like Rigurdo wanted to say something, but I didn\u2019t pay attention.</p><br/><p>Having finished naming the goblins, I proceeded to the wolves.</p><br/><p>Their next leader is the previous one\u2019s son.</p><br/><p>He looks like his father with that sturdy build, and carries the same air around him.</p><br/><p>Looking at those blood-red eyes, I think of a name.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! Let\u2019s go with the kanji for tempest fang\u2013\u201cRanga\u201d!</p><br/><p>(TL Note: one of the readings for  (storm, tempest) is ran, and for  (fang) is ga.)</p><br/><p>I know, my names suck.</p><br/><p>I just took my family name and mixed it with their species.</p><br/><p>Well, \u201cIt\u2019s good to give appropriate names\u201d\u2026 those words I will not heed.</p><br/><p>At that moment!</p><br/><p>I felt the magical energy being sucked out from my body.</p><br/><p>And, I was attacked by extreme lethargy!</p><br/><p>What\u2026 the?</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve never felt this tired since being reborn.</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cExplanation. You have used magical energy beyond your capabilities! Switching over to lowered activity state.</p><br/><p>Complete restoration predicted in three days.\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>I am conscious.</p><br/><p>Since I don\u2019t need sleep.</p><br/><p>I can also hear [Great Sage]\u2019s explanation. After which, I finally comprehended the situation.</p><br/><p>I used too much magical energy? So, I ran out of MP, huh?</p><br/><p>However, what caused that too happen? Had all the skills I used till now come bite me at once?</p><br/><p>But it doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s the case.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t move my body.</p><br/><p>So lowered activity state is like hibernation\u2026 without sleep.</p><br/><p>While panicking, Rigurdo is nursing my body.</p><br/><p>In any case, there\u2019s not much they can do; so, they just sat me by the bonfire\u2026</p><br/><p>Conscious yet inactive.</p><br/><p>So, I was thinking about that phenomenon.</p><br/><p>My magical energy decreased when I was giving out names.</p><br/><p>Giving names uses up my magical energy, huh\u2026</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, a lot of magical energy was used when giving the fang wolves\u2019 leader a name.</p><br/><p>So giving monsters names requires magical energy.</p><br/><p>That conclusion took me two days to work out.</p><br/><p>This would be the cause of Rigurdo\u2019s worries, wouldn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>Wait a second\u2026 is it common sense in this world?</p><br/><p>Speak up!!! How would I know if you don\u2019t tell me\u2026</p><br/><p>If I could complain, I\u2019d be screaming my lungs out.</p><br/><p>Well, if I could move my body, I\u2019d complain.</p><br/><p>Screaming my lungs out? Who said such a thing?</p><br/><p>But anyways, when I stopped moving the goblins, of course, got worried\u2026</p><br/><p>And, a fight started out about who\u2019d be taking care of me first.</p><br/><p>What the hell are they doing\u2026 stop joking around. I can do without a goblin harem.</p><br/><p>\u2026 I was basically treated like a divine ornament that blessed those that stroked it.</p><br/><p>And so, three days passed.</p><br/><p>COMPLETE RE-CO-VE-RY!</p><br/><p>After having run out of magical energy, aggregate amount of magical energy and magic power seemed to have increased.</p><br/><p>Magic power allows us to operate.</p><br/><p>Magical energy is what we utilize.</p><br/><p>Somehow, I seem to have understood it. I think.</p><br/><p>So to summarize, \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger\u201d type of thing.</p><br/><p>Should I experiment? Is what I thought, but I decided against it.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t see a particular reason to do it, and dying during the experiment would be sad.</p><br/><p>For you see, I have already crossed that line.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you let down your guard, you die!\u201d so I learned.</p><br/><p>Now, then\u2026</p><br/><p>Having noticed that I have awoken, the goblins immediately gathered.</p><br/><p>The fang wolves, too, entered the village.</p><br/><p>That being good and all\u2026 but, what\u2019s up with this\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys\u2026 you\u2019re huge!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yes.</p><br/><p>Goblins are normally 150 cm tall. However, they are at least 180 now.</p><br/><p>(TL Note: From about 5 feet to 6 feet)</p><br/><p>The guy in front of me is over 2 meters tall. (6.5 feet)</p><br/><p>The fang wolves, as well: their olive brown fur has turned jet black, giving off a charming shine.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they are now three meters in length (about 10 feet). Last I saw them, they were at most, two (6.5 feet).</p><br/><p>And, silently walking over here, giving out a strange aura, was a five-meter long wolf (16 feet).</p><br/><p>Damn, that\u2019s scary.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cMy master! Your recovery fills me with endless joy!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He fluently said.</p><br/><p>\u2026 that can\u2019t be\u2026 \u201cRanga\u201d, right?</p><br/><p>What the hell happened here these days\u2026</p><br/><p>While I was at a loss, the monsters filled the forest with a roar of delight!</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: the Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Titles: One who Commands Monsters</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Skills: Unique Skill [Great Sage], Unique Skill [Predator], Slime-Specific Skills [Dissolve, Absorb, Regenerate], Extra Skill [Water Manipulation], Extra Skill [Magic Perception], Acquired Skills: Black Serpent [Heat Detection, Noxious Breath], Centipede [Paralysis Breath], Spider [Sticky Thread, Steel Threat], Bat [Ultrasound Waves], Lizard [Body Armor], Wolf [Supreme Sense of Smell, Telepathic Communication, Coercion]</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance EX, Physical Attack Resistance, Pain Resistance, Electricity Resistance, Paralysis Resistance</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>In her long life, Velgrind had rarely seen Velzard revealing her emotions.</p><br/><p>But right now \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>She was beside herself with rage and went mad with jealousy\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Her appearance now was far too different from the normal Velzard.</p><br/><p>Velgrind felt a sense of incongruity from that appearance.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there was something strange about her words to Rudra.</p><br/><p>The words Velzard had spat out \u300cHe\u2019s just a human, after all\u300d, seemed to lack of sentiments towards an old acquaintance.</p><br/><p>Right, as if all of her emotions had been squeezed out by negative emotions such as jealousy and anger\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(As expected, I can't think of anything but that Nee-san is being controlled.)</p><br/><p>Velgrind concluded so.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, she declared that it was necessary to make Velzard come to her senses.</p><br/><p>But, Velgrind, more than anyone else, knew that it wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><br/><p>Certainly, if it was Velgrind, she could fight Velzard evenly.</p><br/><p>However, that was if it was only a kind of quarrel between siblings.</p><br/><p>If both of them fought seriously with the intention to kill, Velgrind would 100% lose to Velzard.</p><br/><p>Possessing the highest energy after Veldanava and the ultimate defense. That was Velzard.</p><br/><p>Although one might say that Velgrind specialized in offensive, she couldn\u2019t breakthrough Velzard\u2019s defense.</p><br/><p>Similarly, Velzard\u2019s offensive power couldn\u2019t inflict a fatal blow on Velgrind.</p><br/><p>It was the reason why it could be perceived as equal by the surroundings, but the circumstances were actually different.</p><br/><p>Burning Breath[1] that Velgrind breathed out, which was a simultaneous multi-attack, was dispersed by Diamond Dust[2] blowing from Velzard, only to bloom as large fire flowers in the air.</p><br/><p>However, Freezing Breath[3] that Velzard breathed out was evaporated by Cardinal Rain[4] that blooming around Velgrind.</p><br/><p>Both of them didn\u2019t receive damage, but the aftermath of the attacks would deal a big effect on the ice-bound world.</p><br/><p>And so, even a fight between the two that appeared equal, gradually showed whose superior and inferior\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is odd\u201d So, Velgrind was the one who realized it.</p><br/><p>Normally, in case of an all-out battle like this, Velgrind should have lost due to the difference in maximum energy.</p><br/><p>It was something that won\u2019t get noticed unless both of them used all of their power, but there\u2019s a clear difference in energy consumption between them.</p><br/><p> \u2015\u2015No, there was.</p><br/><p>If it was Velgrind from before, her power should have gradually weakened due to the difference in their energy recovery rate.</p><br/><p>However, right now, it was quite strange that her body was in great shape.</p><br/><p>Her prided ability, Ultimate Skill\u300eCharity Lord Raguel\u300f was also handling energy more efficiently unlike before.</p><br/><p>It had reacted to Velgrind\u2019s will and responded to her feelings without causing any momentary error.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu, you\u2019ve improved, Velgrind.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI still have a long ways to go, Nee-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>Velgrind responded lightly to a fairly surprised Velzard\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>In fact, Velgrind was still had more energy to spare.</p><br/><p>There could only be one reason that caused this...</p><br/><p>Yes.</p><br/><p>This must be the deed of that bad friend[5] of her brother, Veldora, that questionable slime named Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Even Velgrind\u2019s strongest technique, \u201cCardinal Acceleration\u201d didn\u2019t work on him; he even had evolved into a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d that is equal to them, becoming an abnormal existence.</p><br/><p>He surpassed Velgrind easily, an unthinkable Absolute Being[6].</p><br/><p>Velgrind thought that even if he had Dragon Factor, she couldn\u2019t acknowledge such a suspicious person as her own younger brother.</p><br/><p>But, he was her benefactor who listened to her request and freed Rudra.</p><br/><p>And above all, that slime was the one who manifested Velgrind and she certainly had pledged her cooperation to him.</p><br/><p>If that was so, there was no need to hesitate at all.</p><br/><p>The only thing that bound her down right now was her troubled heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who is Rudra\u2019s enemy?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Who is Velda?\u2019</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t care about such things.</p><br/><p>The important thing was she didn\u2019t like Velda, only that.</p><br/><p>He had swindled the name of her beloved older brother and manipulated her only older sister.</p><br/><p>She would never forgive a person like that.</p><br/><p>If there was someone who tried to tie them down, who were originally free beings, it would be their right to declare that person as their enemy.</p><br/><p>At the very least, Demon Lord Rimuru didn\u2019t bind Velgrind down.</p><br/><p>Then, as long as he was worthy of her trust, Velgrind wouldn\u2019t break her promise with Demon Lord Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Velgrind thought it was impossible for her to win due to the difference of the absolute value of energy.</p><br/><p>However, that thought was wrong.</p><br/><p>Because she had been eaten by Demon Lord Rimuru, Velgrind had been reborn stronger than how she was before.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I\u2019ll make you at ease soon, Nee-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t get conceited, Velgrind. I\u2019m also busy, let\u2019s us finish this farce quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>Their gazes interlocked.</p><br/><p>And then, both of them let their violent energy escalate and their clash grew even more intense.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Guy and Chloe continued their fight with just their swords.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t serious against each other.</p><br/><p>However, it was a high-level fight at a level that couldn\u2019t be recognized by others.</p><br/><p>As if he was having fun, Guy had his attention focused on the clash between the dragon sisters in the air instead of his own fight.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he was the first person who noticed it.</p><br/><p>An angel of light had come to visit them from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat is\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy muttered softly.</p><br/><p>However, everything was already too late.</p><br/><p>Guy had certainly seen that angel smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey! You two, here\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Before Guy\u2019s warning reached them, a spherical space barrier[7] had appeared on the northern land.</p><br/><p>And then, a beautiful woman\u2019s voice echoed.</p><br/><p>\u300cUltimate Dominion[8]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy predicted everything instantly.</p><br/><p>Everyone in this area except Guy had been affected by the ability just now.</p><br/><p>However, it was a rare event for Guy, as his comprehension would be wrong.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Lucia let out a loud laughter.</p><br/><p>Everything was as Velda expected.</p><br/><p>No, it was beyond his expectations; the best possible situation was in place.</p><br/><p>As much as to say that for this moment, she had revised the plan numerous times while preparing for this situation.</p><br/><p>It was convenient now that Chloe wasn\u2019t being controlled smoothly.</p><br/><p>In any case, the body of the strongest Hero would become one with Lucia, who was Velda\u2019s right hand.</p><br/><p>And then, she would obtain the two \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>She would put them under her complete control with the angel series\u2019 Ultimate Skill as the medium.</p><br/><p>It was one of the hidden ability of Ultimate Skill\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300f.</p><br/><p>In this northern land, the strongest beings would have their final showdown.</p><br/><p>Velgrind who was worried about her sister, Velzard would surely make an appearance there too.</p><br/><p>That was Velda\u2019s prediction.</p><br/><p>For some reason\u300eThought Transmission\u300f didn\u2019t reach Velgrind, but it was impossible for her to resist it if the ability was used directly.</p><br/><p>This was Velda\u2019s plan, he who had extensive knowledge about the principles behind the abilities.</p><br/><p>While forcing Guy to stay put, she was going to put Velzard and Velgrind under her rule completely.</p><br/><p>Next was the awakened Hero, Chloe Aubert.</p><br/><p>Even if she was called the strongest Hero, she was just a human in the end.</p><br/><p>As she had served her purpose in this stage, she was such an insignificant being that it wouldn\u2019t become a problem even if she was to be disposed of.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 However, it was a different story if she owned Ultimate Skill\u300eHope Lord Sariel\u300f.</p><br/><p>Now, such a thing as Chloe\u2019s life and death was nothing but a trivial matter.</p><br/><p>But, if she was looking for a prime body to incarnate into, there was no other body as wonderful as Chloe\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Strong and beautiful.</p><br/><p>She had reached the realm of god with a mortal body.</p><br/><p>Indeed, it could be said as a new body suitable to be obtained by Lucia in this world.</p><br/><p>Unlike Lucia\u2019s corpse that was given to her by Velda, her god, Chloe\u2019s body was specialized in combat.</p><br/><p>What made that possible was thanks to the new ability granted to her by Velda\u2015\u2015\u300eMultiple Existence\u300f.</p><br/><p>Lucia\u2019s ability was ill-suited for splitting her energy using\u300eMultiple Existence\u300f. After all, she existed because Lucia\u2019s body was used as the vessel of her real main body.[9]</p><br/><p>More than anything, the body which was the vessel of her spirit didn\u2019t possess the capability to create multiple clones.</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t mean that Lucia was inferior; it just means that Rimuru who could create them freely was abnormal.</p><br/><p>Anyway, even Veldora and Velgrind had their physical bodies created by Rimuru\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>As Lucia couldn\u2019t duplicate the body freely, \u300eMultiple Existence\u300fwas like casting pearls before swine.</p><br/><p>However, if she had prepared a new vessel, she only had to project her consciousness into it.</p><br/><p>Lucia\u2019s body was exclusively for commanding, she only had to let the body wait upon Velda\u2019s side in the sky castle in order to not get the body injured.</p><br/><p>And, as a spiritual life-form, she would only transfer her consciousness and energy into Chloe\u2019s body by using\u300eMultiple Existence\u300f.</p><br/><p>The fact that Chloe was in this situation was proof of Velda\u2019s commandment.</p><br/><p>As Chloe had not been controlled completely even by Yuuki\u2019s control skill, she had given them quite of trouble, and Lucia didn\u2019t even notice that Chloe had acquired Ultimate Skill\u300eHope Lord Sariel\u300f.</p><br/><p>Chloe wasn\u2019t the type that would let her guard down; she would hide that ability until she was being cornered into a wall which was annoying, so Lucia thought.</p><br/><p>After all, she possessed Unique Skill\u300eAbsolute Severance\u300fand\u300eInfinite Prison\u300f which was too strong for a human like her.</p><br/><p>But, this time, she was forced to use that hidden ability under Velzard\u2019s serious assaults.</p><br/><p>Consequently, it was fortunate that this proved that Chloe possessed an angel series\u2019 ability as well.</p><br/><p>Originally, the plan was to kill Guy for sure.</p><br/><p>And also include Chloe\u2019s disposal.</p><br/><p>Against Guy who wouldn\u2019t let his guard down, Velzard and Chloe would be at a disadvantage even if they were together.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, in the worst case that Guy won, he would get stronger.</p><br/><p>To prevent an outcome like that, Lucia sought a certain victory.</p><br/><p>Prolonging the fight by making it a 3-way fight. So, she ordered Velzard.</p><br/><p>In order to strengthen Ultimate Dominion, her plan was to deploy Space type magic circles that prevent escape at the same time as Velgrind appeared.</p><br/><p>And so, the strategy succeeded splendidly, the domination was completed just a while ago.</p><br/><p>For the Hero Chloe to be dominated too was just an extra.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong Guy was, he wouldn\u2019t be able to win with the two dragon sisters as his opponents.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lucia would steal Chloe\u2019s body and deal the finishing blow on Guy.</p><br/><p>It was the best timing for Lucia who hadn\u2019t got incarnated yet.</p><br/><p>The plan was altered and became more perfect than before.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>In the place that was a hall, there were the \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d sisters who returned to their human forms.</p><br/><p>As Velzard changed back to her human form, Velgrind also did the same.</p><br/><p>Beyond Velzard\u2019s gaze were Guy and Chloe fighting\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>No\u2015\u2015 beyond them was a beautiful angel flying down from the sky.</p><br/><p>She must be the owner of the lovely voice that echoed just after the place was enveloped by the barrier.</p><br/><p>A user of that curse, no it should be called as True Word, the absolute order language.</p><br/><p>And so that angel opened her mouth as she landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cControl yourselves, I\u2019m Velda-sama\u2019s right hand, the \u201cArchangel of the End[10]\u201d Lucia.\u300d</p><br/><p>She introduced herself solemnly, emanating intimidation.</p><br/><p>Velzard heard those words and bowed to Lucia as to show her respect.</p><br/><p>Velgrind felt it was unpleasant.</p><br/><p>However, she couldn\u2019t understand, Velgrind followed after her too even though she felt it was unpleasant.</p><br/><p>\u300cI knew it, it\u2019s you! Those words force an absolute control over those with angel series\u2019 ability, don\u2019t they?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHah, as expected of you, Guy Crimson. The only person Velda-sama was cautious of. However, it\u2019s already too late even if you know about it. What you can do now is only await your death obediently.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up! An insect like you shouldn\u2019t speak so arrogantly!\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy shouted as he swung his sword at Lucia.</p><br/><p>But, his sword was easily repelled by the barrier that appeared around Lucia.</p><br/><p>Lucia smiled as if sneering at Guy and continued her steps towards Chloe.</p><br/><p>Hearing Guy\u2019s words, Velgrind could also understand the situation.</p><br/><p>What was happening to her body right now.</p><br/><p>And, what had happened to her sister body too.</p><br/><p>(Unforgivable. I will never forgive you, Velda!)</p><br/><p>Due to fury and humiliation, Velgrind was burning with violent emotions to the extent of being dizzy.</p><br/><p>At the same time, she thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, everything will be as Velda\u2019s expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Velgrind couldn\u2019t defy the order,</p><br/><p>Even if Guy was cunning and was the strongest being, there was no chance for him to win fighting against both Velzard and Velgrind at the same time.</p><br/><p>Lucia seemed to be convinced of her victory as she ignored Guy\u2019s attacks as if to say to Guy to do as he likes as she approached Chloe.</p><br/><p>\u300cChloe Aubert, accept me.\u300d</p><br/><p>Leaving those words, the spirit of\u300eMultiple Existence\u300fseparated from Lucia and was sucked into Chloe.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch!\u300d</p><br/><p>As if he was flustered, Guy attacked both Chloe/Lucia, but everything was already too late.</p><br/><p>A barrier created by Lucia\u2019s ability appeared before Chloe.</p><br/><p>It meant that Lucia had succeeded her incarnation and fused completely with Chloe.</p><br/><p>Whether he understood that or not, for the first time Guy caught a glimpse of his impatience.</p><br/><p>Lucia was assured of her victory and smiled.</p><br/><p>And then, her main body which finished transferring fragments of her energy and consciousness into Chloe, transferred back to the heaven.</p><br/><p>Along with the confidence of her victory.</p><br/><p>The Hero\u2019s power and Lucia\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>Right now, a flawless entity was about to be born.</p><br/><p>Velgrind could feel despair spreading across the place.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, a voice echoed in the place.</p><br/><p>\u300cKuaaaahahahaha!

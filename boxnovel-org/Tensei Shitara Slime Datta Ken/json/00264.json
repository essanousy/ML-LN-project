Please, forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, it can\u2019t be helped. Although I am reluctant, I do understand that I have to be the model for the people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much for your kind words.\u201d</p><br/><p>While sucking on the ration, I stared at them, exasperated.</p><br/><p>The butler apologizing to Julius was the student Maria\u2019s escort, if I am not wrong. Yep, that\u2019s probably it considering that they\u2019re sitting on the same table.</p><br/><p>Other than them, there\u2019s also a boy and another girl sitting there, with both of their butlers serving as well.</p><br/><p>As if they were in a different world.</p><br/><p>I had a boat load of things I wanted to say to him like where they got those food or that this is the time to be working together or if they actually knew what they\u2019re talking about, but for now, there\u2019s one thing I understood well and it\u2019s that this guy really can\u2019t read the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Karma looked annoyed and Magnus just gave a bitter smile while looking towards Julius.</p><br/><p>Normally they would probably flare up at him but the situation was so bad that they didn\u2019t even have the willpower to complain.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks so good. This much isn\u2019t really enough for me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Beside me, a fat student let out a sad sigh.</p><br/><p>Judging from his fat, that amount of food is certainly quite sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t complain! This has been optimised to have the perfect nutrition balance and makes you feel full, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>A girl beside him scolded him for whining.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s exactly right. Although the taste isn\u2019t very good, this ration is a top quality product.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. But, you know, I am a battle type too so\u2026 That kind of deception doesn\u2019t work for me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy repeatedly sighed.</p><br/><p>It seems he was trained against illusions and neurotoxins so the effect which had some merit to him was also ineffective now.</p><br/><p>It might be that he\u2019s just being gluttonous but it sure is pretty rough when there\u2019s a limit to how much you can eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s half-eaten but do you want some of mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>And so I offered him mine but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, is it okay? Then, uwah-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Mondo-kun, you okay? I will have a look at you so come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>A branch suddenly came falling directly onto this Mondo kid\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Mondo was now being held up by instructor Pyuri, who had pretty, silver hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, is he alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ehh, you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I am Satoru. I am just a normal person who got caught up-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, umm. Satoru-kun, eh? He is fine so you don\u2019t need to worry, okay? Ah, right, in situations like this, I think it\u2019s not good to give your food to others, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said, after hesitating for a moment there.</p><br/><p>Is she thinking of me as impertinous or is she really worried as an instructor?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Since we don\u2019t know our enemy\u2019s abilities, we need to take it seriously from the start.</p><br/><p>The construction of the city is proceeding smoothly, but we have not prepared any fortifications.</p><br/><p>Thus, if we are attacked, relocating would be the best option. So I decided.</p><br/><p>So what are we to do? In response to that thought,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe decisive battle will occur at the marshes If we win, great. If we lose, we\u2019ll retreat back here as fast as circumstances allow.</p><br/><p>In that case, since fighting here wouldn\u2019t increase our chances of winning, we will barricade ourselves in the Cave of the Seal.</p><br/><p>While holding the fort, we will request help from the humans.</p><br/><p>If we request through the guild, they just might help, so prepare yourselves to evacuate at a moments notice.</p><br/><p>Regarding our attack,</p><br/><p>I\u2019m designating Benimaru as the captain in charge of the hundred wolf riders.</p><br/><p>Shion, you indiscriminately slaughter at your discretion.</p><br/><p>Hakurou will serve as my Adjutant.</p><br/><p>I will create a network with [Telepathic Communication] for you all to join and issue orders as needed.</p><br/><p>A withdraw order will be given by your commander\u2013me.</p><br/><p>Riguru will stay with the remaining goblins and see to the defense of the city.</p><br/><p>Dismissed!\u300d</p><br/><p>I thus conveyed the plan.</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded; no one disagreed.</p><br/><p>I had thought that there would be some complaints about requesting help from the humans, but seems like I was mistaken.</p><br/><p>I wonder if they have gotten over their aversion after spending some time with those adventurers.</p><br/><p>As for the guild request, if I sell the demonic steel, we should have enough gold. And besides, the orcs are as much a threat to the humans.</p><br/><p>If we hold a proper discussion, we should be able to gain their assistance. That much I probably shouldn\u2019t worry about.</p><br/><p>And besides, we\u2019re already trying to figure out just how dangerous this Orc Lord is.</p><br/><p>Anyways, completing the goblin\u2019s armor takes priority.</p><br/><p>I had ordered Kaijin to quickly produce 100 armors.</p><br/><p>Benimaru, Hakurou, and Shion also need some armor.</p><br/><p>Before Souei returns with their response, we need to finish these preparations. If they reject our alliance, we will move as soon as we ascertain Gabil\u2019s motives.</p><br/><p>If we can\u2019t fight side by side, we should wait for the Lizardmen to deal the first strike.</p><br/><p>Having thus decided, we concluded the conference.</p><br/><p>After dismissing the group, almost all immediately left.</p><br/><p>Only the three oni and I were left inside.</p><br/><p>Do they want something? I looked inquisitively at Benimaru,</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-sama, do you perhaps worry too much?</p><br/><p>Even if You do not trouble yourself to ride onto the battlefield, Hakurou and I alone should manage, would you not agree?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs he said. Rimuru-sama is our lord. Commanding the battle can be left to us, if you so wish.\u300d</p><br/><p>So they said.</p><br/><p>No, no, that won\u2019t do at all. I mean, you guys have been had by orcs before!</p><br/><p>But, of course, I didn\u2019t say that.</p><br/><p>We shouldn\u2019t count that time before they had evolved.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, that should be fine. I just plan to observe the battle from above, and leave the orders to Benimaru.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, so it was like that!\u300d</p><br/><p>They agreed with my words.</p><br/><p>In the first place, I have never commanded a battle. While I\u2019ve ran plenty simulations, I have no actual experience.</p><br/><p>Thus, as I observe from above, I intend to devote myself fully to relay orders.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat aside, you guys, get yourselves ready. Unless you are planning on fighting a war in the nude?\u300d</p><br/><p>Nodding at my words, the three oni.</p><br/><p>And thus, we headed towards the production building.</p><br/><p>Dedicated to the Department of Production,</p><br/><p>A building as a large as a gymnasium made of wood. We had planned on reinforcing the walls with mortar, but have yet to get around to it.</p><br/><p>Still, the building is the largest in its kind, and looks pretty impressive.</p><br/><p>Upon entering, we are assaulted by the noise of hard labor. At my order, they are busy producing 100 sets of armor.</p><br/><p>Well actually, only the dwarf Garm and Doldo are making things with ten apprentice goblins assist them.</p><br/><p>The rest are preparing raw material and transporting completed products.</p><br/><p>We proceed further in.</p><br/><p>Recently, they\u2019ve also warded off rooms for specialized products.</p><br/><p>Only Shuna can enter that room\u2013the rest are forbidden. She is far too skilled and teaching others will take too long.</p><br/><p>Goblinas were also learning the textile craft, and are right now working under Garm producing hemp-linen clothing.</p><br/><p>Gradually, they should move on to finer work with silk.</p><br/><p>Since under the armor one must first wear linen.</p><br/><p>We proceeded towards Shuna\u2019s room, and, after I announced ourselves, entered.</p><br/><p>Shuna greeted us with a smile.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know when it happened, but I suddenly found myself wrapped in a beautiful kimono.</p><br/><p>Not pure white, but dyed in a pale crimson color; needless to say, it was cute.</p><br/><p>Standing up from a chair,</p><br/><p>\u300cI had been waiting.</p><br/><p>I wished to participate in the conference myself, but feared unable to contribute better than with a meal, I humbly ask your forgiveness.</p><br/><p>However, I had finished preparing Rimuru-sama\u2019s dress. And Onii-sama and the rest\u2019s by the way.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u201dBy the way\u201d huh\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHo ho ho. That\u2019s only to be expected.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, considering Shuna-sama\u2019s marvelous skill. I would presume mine to have been made as well?\u300d</p><br/><p>The three thus responded.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere they are!\u300d</p><br/><p>With those words, she brought out more dresses.</p><br/><p>A pure white kimono.</p><br/><p>Having received mine, I was guided to a room to change.</p><br/><p>First, I entered and began changing.</p><br/><p>Changing into my child form that wore the black fur coat.</p><br/><p>Removing the coat, I wrapped myself in the kimono that Shuna had made.</p><br/><p>A glossy linen. First class silk that feels wonderful to the touch.</p><br/><p>Underneath, I\u2019ll probably wear the pants I previously received. Putting the silk to my body, it immediately changed size to fit me.</p><br/><p>This one also became a magic item, huh.</p><br/><p>Seems like after mixing with my magic it becomes as if a part of my body.</p><br/><p>Just to try, I change into an adult and, as expected, the clothing grows appropriately.</p><br/><p>What a wonderful product she had made.</p><br/><p>Wearing the coat over it, I finished with the clothing.</p><br/><p>Then, I take out an item from my breast pocket.</p><br/><p>It is a beautiful mask.</p><br/><p>The one Shizu-san had forgotten, the \u201cAnti-demon Mask\u201d.</p><br/><p>My body radiates a small amount of magical energy as aura.</p><br/><p>If I focus, I can conceal it, but there have been times when I\u2019ve let it spill.</p><br/><p>Thus, I plan to use this mask to hide it.</p><br/><p>It had broken once before, but I had Doldo repair it.</p><br/><p>I equipped the mask. Strange, but it makes me feel calm.</p><br/><p>Normally, since I don\u2019t need to breathe, I don\u2019t do it even as a human.</p><br/><p>I could create lungs if I wanted to, but since I don\u2019t see a need to, I haven\u2019t made them.</p><br/><p>However, when wearing a mask I can pretend to be breathing.</p><br/><p>And it doesn\u2019t feel strange.</p><br/><p>Okay. When we head out into the world, let\u2019s use this appearance.</p><br/><p>Returning to my child form, I had so decided.</p><br/><p>Wearing the clothing, I exit the fitting room.</p><br/><p>Praising my looks for a while, Shuna continued to help the other oni.</p><br/><p>This clothing. Absorbing the aura of its wearer, it can change its appearance.</p><br/><p>My clothing turned jet black.</p><br/><p>Benimaru\u2019s blood red.</p><br/><p>Hakurou\u2019s pure white.</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s, of course, turned purple. It\u2019d be strange if it turned orange or something.</p><br/><p>Seems like even if this clothing rips, as long as it absorbs our magical energy, it can repair itself.</p><br/><p>Magic items completely specialized for our use.</p><br/><p>Truly magnificent! And I must admit that I was surprised when I heard that we can change how the clothing looks at will.</p><br/><p>Makes changing clothing seem kind of pointless. In the first place, had you bought this, you just might wear it for the rest of your life.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know how good human magic items are, but this one is worthy of an A rank appraisal.</p><br/><p>A very high quality product.</p><br/><p>Thus, I can probably expect some great weapon from Kurobee.</p><br/><p>After saying thanks and taking Souei\u2019s clothing with us, we took our leave.</p><br/><p>The next place we stopped by was Kurobee\u2019s smithy.</p><br/><p>Recently, he has been so busy with production that he hasn\u2019t even shown his face around the city.</p><br/><p>That he\u2019s fine in there, I know\u2026 he\u2019s probably the type that gets engrossed in what he loves.</p><br/><p>Seems like he\u2019s been working in there without sleep the past few days.</p><br/><p>Kaijin had mentioned it before the conference.</p><br/><p>The door to his room was open.</p><br/><p>Kaijin had provided him with a set of tools he took from the kingdom.</p><br/><p>Next to his room stands a warehouse where I deposited the materials I kept.</p><br/><p>The demon steel I held I also deposited there. As a material it\u2019s also there, but I just help but think of iron ore as unreliable.</p><br/><p>We had wanted to investigate the nearby mountains for any iron ore deposits, but planned it for a later day.</p><br/><p>Because of ongoing construction, there have been too few hands around here.</p><br/><p>From within the room the sound of clashing metal and the heat of the furnace leaked.</p><br/><p>This is the only place with a high temperature furnace. Made with packed, backed clay, a furnace we had built.</p><br/><p>Though it was made with my [Fire Manipulation] ability, it came out pretty well. I plan to later analyze this furnace, and increase the number of them in the village.</p><br/><p>I have a ton of plans, but not enough hands.</p><br/><p>That aside, having noticed us, Kurobee came out.</p><br/><p>Showing his whole face\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI have been waiting! By all means, come and behold!\u300d</p><br/><p>He greeted us with a face that wanted to boast of his products.</p><br/><p>Two hours had passed.</p><br/><p>We were listening to the explanation with eyes devoid of life.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s fine already! We get it, we get it! It\u2019s amazing!</p><br/><p>I had wanted to say those words many times, but just couldn\u2019t bring myself to.</p><br/><p>Seeing Kurobee\u2019s happy face stopped me. What can I\u2026 I began thinking thus.</p><br/><p>(Rimuru-sama, would now be a good time?)</p><br/><p>Telepathically, I was asked. By Souei.</p><br/><p>I had sent him to offer an alliance, but\u2026 did he encounter trouble? Could he be\u2026 lost?</p><br/><p>After leaving looking so cool only to come back saying, \u201cMy bad, I have no clue where to go, where is it?\u201d Even the benevolent me would get mad at that\u2026</p><br/><p>I had begun worrying slightly, but of course the worry was needless.</p><br/><p>With a voice free of worry,</p><br/><p>(I had met with the Lizardmen\u2019s head. He accepted our offer.</p><br/><p>However, he wishes for us to journey there\u2026)</p><br/><p>What did he say! To have arrived already. Isn\u2019t it too fast?</p><br/><p>Not even half a day has passed since the conference ended.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s no problem. If anything, I was planning on settling it there anyways. And besides, you already arrived?)</p><br/><p>(Ah, yes. By moving through the shadows I arrived at the marshes without great difficulty. If it were to someone I knew, I could have moved instantly.</p><br/><p>That aside, when shall we hold the strategy meeting?)</p><br/><p>That aside, huh? Isn\u2019t it a damn amazing skill! That Shadow Step.</p><br/><p>I can also use it, but was it that amazing? I haven\u2019t used it that much yet, though\u2026</p><br/><p>That was a surprise\u2026 oh well.</p><br/><p>(Yeah\u2026 preparations will take some time, and we\u2019ll also need to account the time it takes for the wolf riders to travel there, set it five days from now.)</p><br/><p>(Understood! I shall do as you command)</p><br/><p>(After the negotiations end, come back. If you have to\u2013as a clone)</p><br/><p>(As you will!)</p><br/><p>He handled the negotiations well. What a useful guy.</p><br/><p>We are quiet a distance away from the marshes.</p><br/><p>If marching by foot, it would take two weeks; the wolves could over it in three days.</p><br/><p>That lizard Gabil came riding on some big monster.</p><br/><p>But we shouldn\u2019t arrive before him.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a chance he will strike us in back; rather, observing the situation and seizing the initiative should be something that we will do.</p><br/><p>After thinking about these things, I tuned in to the never ending explanation.</p><br/><p>\u300cI apologize for my belated appearance.\u300d</p><br/><p>Souei appeared from the shadows.</p><br/><p>Just like a ninja.</p><br/><p>Giving him his clothing, I asked him to change.</p><br/><p>At Souei\u2019s appearance, Kurobee seems to have came back from his own little world.</p><br/><p>Ohon! He cleared his throat, and brought out a number of swords.</p><br/><p>We finally see what we came for.</p><br/><p>He showed us six swords.</p><br/><p>Simple, straight sword.</p><br/><p>An elegant tachi.</p><br/><p>Shaped like a cane, katana.</p><br/><p>A massive, odachi.</p><br/><p>And two ninjato.</p><br/><p>Pleased with his creations, he lined them up.</p><br/><p>And thus said,</p><br/><p>\u300cFor Rimuru-sama, I offer this straight sword. This is but a base, it is not yet complete. We wish to create a weapon from demonic steel as Rimuru-sama has suggested. That is our goal, but Kaijin and I are busy researching towards that end. Therefore, please wait some more! Until then, please keep the sword inside of you. \u300d</p><br/><p>With those words, he handed me the sword.</p><br/><p>I see, they are still continuing their research? Makes me excited.</p><br/><p>Something to look forward to.</p><br/><p>\u300cGot it!\u300d</p><br/><p>With a nod, I deposit the sword into my stomach. To let it mix with my magic in there.</p><br/><p>Kurobee nods once, and hands me another sword.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is a prototype among prototypes. Please honor us by using it as a replacement.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll happily put it to use.</p><br/><p>Using the skills I have been learning from Hakurou recently.</p><br/><p>Really wanted to have a sword. Thus, I hang it on my hip.</p><br/><p>Somehow, it makes me feel strong.</p><br/><p>And each one of us receives a sword.</p><br/><p>Benimaru the tachi. Hakurou the katana.</p><br/><p>Shion the odachi.</p><br/><p>How will she draw it? It\u2019s a freaking huge katana,</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease fret not. The scabbard is made from magical energy, it will disappear when you wish.\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what he said.</p><br/><p>It looks so heavy that a normal person couldn\u2019t use it; even Kaijin would be hard to wield it.</p><br/><p>The dwarfs also have some bizarre strength, but can barely lift it with both hands.</p><br/><p>Shion, however, holds it easily with one hand.</p><br/><p>Souei came back after changing and took the two ninjato. A two sword style, huh\u2026</p><br/><p>Somehow it fits him.</p><br/><p>After we had taken our weapons, Garm stopped by.</p><br/><p>He had finished oni\u2019s armor.</p><br/><p>Seems like he was running out of iron so. Thus, he was unable to create full plate armor.</p><br/><p>Instead, he made it out of monster\u2019s materials\u2013scale mail.</p><br/><p>Much like the one they had given to the adventurer Cabal before.</p><br/><p>This too seems to have been affected by my magical energy. Created partially from the demonic steel I had, it is considerably strong than that test product.</p><br/><p>To me, however, he gave Dark Leather Guards.</p><br/><p>And thus, we finished preparing our equipment.</p><br/><p>The following day.</p><br/><p>The goblins have finished their preparations.</p><br/><p>With one week\u2019s worth of provision, they wait for us.</p><br/><p>Next comes the decisive battle. Only bring enough food to get there and back. If we burden the troops with too much, we\u2019ll lose speed.</p><br/><p>Mobility is everything, if we fail, we must run.</p><br/><p>I had thought preparing provisions would take two days, but seeing how they were ready already, we managed to finish early.</p><br/><p>Well, though I said 5 days, there should be no problem with coming early.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe enemy is the Orc Lord! Now, advance!\u300d</p><br/><p>I simply declared.</p><br/><p>If we lose, then that\u2019s that. We proceed as fate allows.</p><br/><p>The simpler the goal the better.</p><br/><p>To my declaration the troops responded with a battle cry.</p><br/><p>A shout capable of shattering the enemies\u2019 hearts filled the forest.</p><br/><p>The goblins atop of the wolves are the main force.</p><br/><p>Though there are many new members among them, the goblins that ride the storm wolves are the elite among them.</p><br/><p>Morale is high.</p><br/><p>And having thus seen their spirit, my own worries were dispelled.</p><br/><p>We shall win.</p><br/><p>Enjoying this too much is probably bad. However, riding into battle while imagining defeat is also no good.</p><br/><p>Riding towards the marshes, towards war\u2026 we thus set off.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hakurou vs Shion</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the last match of the third day</p><br/><p>At the center of the Colosseum, Hakurou stands opposite to Shion. </p><br/><p>Inside the tense atmosphere is Milim who act like usual, undisturbed,</p><br/><p>\u300cBegin!\u300d(Milim)</p><br/><p>She shouted.</p><br/><p>Having become more experienced, she gives the announcement fluently.</p><br/><p>By the way, Souka doesn\u2019t take the referee role, she just does the victory proclamation.</p><br/><p>Because there is the risk that Souka will interrupt the more serious sword fights, she only gives live reports.</p><br/><p>Milim, imitating her, doesn\u2019t do anything that would disturb the match.</p><br/><p>She is just happy that she could do something, my worry of her behaving wildly hasn\u2019t come true, I\u2019m really thankful it hasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s pay more attention to the match.</p><br/><p>The two brandished their swords against each other with a quiet atmosphere.</p><br/><p>It is not a relentless sword clash like the fight between Benimaru and Souei, they just straightforwardly test each others\u2019 offence and defense.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s like a calm, flowing river.</p><br/><p>However, a sudden downpour made the river surge.</p><br/><p>Hakuro yelled out with fighting spirit as he slashed in Shion\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>But, Shion isn\u2019t impatient, with a wonderful example of using just enough power to not injure the opponent, she wards off Hakurou\u2019s slash.</p><br/><p>Hakurou is still in contrast to Shion who is always in motion.</p><br/><p>They give such impression, however this battle completely turned that image around.</p><br/><p>Just like in the yesterday\u2019s battle, Shion obviously had grown. Her fighting method was not the one where she just attacks with all of her strength like she had done until recently, but she has changed into a skilled battling method that stresses the importance of rational tactics.</p><br/><p>That is combining strength with technique.This means that her power had increased by one level.</p><br/><p>If going by skill level alone, it didn\u2019t match Hakurouyet, but with both her higher physical strength and skill level supplemented by her instinct, she could fight on par with Hakurou.</p><br/><p>No, they\u2019re not equal.</p><br/><p>Shion who has a flowing sword art, incorporated her irrational herculean strength. Her technique is still immature if compared to Hakurou\u2019s.</p><br/><p>In reality, the one who is seriously fighting and was pushed out in this battle was Hakurou.</p><br/><p>It seems that Hakurou\u2019s swordsmanship was unable to ward off Shion\u2019s sword attack.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou have grown, Shion..... Never did I expect that with your sword\u2019s skill you could get this far.\u300d(Hakurou)</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu. I won\u2019t act violently for forever you know.</p><br/><p>My wish is to reach that high place for sure.</p><br/><p>With my previous self, I could never be useful for Rimuru-sama.\u300d(Shion)</p><br/><p>The swords intersect and repel each other. Once more they face each other by taking a distance.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s more than I thought, they began to display the aspect of an advanced swordsman\u2019s match.</p><br/><p>Hakurou nods in satisfaction after seeing Shion\u2019s growth.</p><br/><p>Souei was the first disciple he took under his wing.</p><br/><p>He knows his own ability and duties, while abstaining himself from overconfidence. An ideal disciple.</p><br/><p>Compared to Souei, Benimaru and Shion were very different.</p><br/><p>No matter how he teaches, they are more about combat rather than theory, and thus, more about strength rather than skill! That was the personality that they carried into their battles.</p><br/><p>However, Benimaru as the young warrior of the Ogres[1] was a boy who had a strong sense of responsibility from the beginning.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it was good that he was aware that self-conceit could make the people he holds dear hurt.</p><br/><p>Like that, Benimaru mastered his awareness and responsibility as a general, he has grown more remarkably than what Hakurou had previously expected.</p><br/><p>For Hakurou too, it was truly a joyous thing.</p><br/><p>But, more than anything for the problem child Shion to become more mature, Hakurou although very surprised, was also delighted.</p><br/><p>For a period of time, Shion\u2019s outrage after being resurrected from the maws of death was an intolerable thing.</p><br/><p>Is her mind unstable? Has her heart gone dark[2]?</p><br/><p>It was as if her heart had been completely dyed by the violent hatred towards people except her friends.</p><br/><p>He had also inspected the situation of \u201cYomigaeri\u201d special training, but they did not give out the feeling of special training but of venting their anger.</p><br/><p>Had Shion\u2019s mind gone mad because she died? So he worried.</p><br/><p>If by some chance Shion turned into someone who causes great harm, he had the resolution to personally deal with her using his sword.</p><br/><p>However, Shion showed growth.</p><br/><p>Shion changed again after being admonished by Rimuru-sama following the fight with the Holy Knights.</p><br/><p>In the end, Shion may just be afraid.</p><br/><p>Afraid of being killed.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because death is scary, but because she was afraid she would disappear without being any use.</p><br/><p>It seemed that finding herself not useful and being forgotten by Rimuru-sama is what she is afraid of, more than anything else, by Hakurou\u2019s analysis.</p><br/><p>For that reason, even for a little, she tries to stand out more than others.</p><br/><p>The cause was also because she was obsessed with foolish things like ranking order.</p><br/><p>She envied the others, she was afraid that if she was not hogging Rimuru-sama\u2019s interest and affection for herself, she would end up forgotten and left behind.</p><br/><p>The jealousy in her heart is the cause of her recklessness.</p><br/><p>However, Rimuru-sama will never forget about us, once she realizes that, the jealousy in her heart will surely disappear.</p><br/><p>In the end, the sense of being securely watched over by a parent was something that protected Shion\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Now, there is no doubt in Shion\u2019s swordsmanship, such a thing told more than any words.</p><br/><p>If she keeps growing at the same rate as now, the day when her ability surpasses Hakurou doesn\u2019t seem far.</p><br/><p>(If that\u2019s true, then I can give my undivided attention to the troublesome youths, such as Gobuta and Gabil.)</p><br/><p>So he thinks, while a delightful smile begins to shape.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, If you\u2019re able to stop this sword, I will confer to you the full mastery of my arts!\u300d(Hakurou)</p><br/><p>He told Shion, and the training sword once more enters it sheath.</p><br/><p>The match will be decided by the next strike.</p><br/><p>To see Shion\u2019s growth was a godsend.</p><br/><p>After this, it is only to enjoy this battle.</p><br/><p>Hakurou intended to use Battoujutsu [3].</p><br/><p>Shion also noticed it.</p><br/><p>However, Shion doesn\u2019t become unnerved. Of course, she won\u2019t use battoujutsu, since her \u014cdachi won\u2019t get additional speed when it was drawn.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like she wasn\u2019t able to do it, but now is not the right time to use it.</p><br/><p>For Shion and the others, Hakurou was the closest person to a parent for them.</p><br/><p>He was the only person who had raised them since they were young.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, one of Shion\u2019s objectives was to be acknowledged by him.</p><br/><p>And then, after surpassing him, she\u2019ll grow. That\u2019s what Shion thought.</p><br/><p>Until recently, the heavy insecurity that had occupied her heart had been completely vanished.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of death.</p><br/><p>But, what she feared more than death was to be forgotten.</p><br/><p>However, it\u2019s alright now.</p><br/><p>Conviction that Rimuru-sama will never forget about her had swept away Shion\u2019s insecurity.</p><br/><p>At the same time as the insecurity was swept away, she realized that it was meaningless to envy others.</p><br/><p>So, instead of envy, she had surpassed it.</p><br/><p>Shion had reached the part where she noticed the meaning of surpassing herself, that \u201cShe\u2019s not another person\u201d. In that case, she will always keep on growing.</p><br/><p>At the end of that progress, thanks to their longer lifespan she could arrive at a perspective that couldn\u2019t be attained by short-lived people.</p><br/><p>When thinking about this, Shion didn\u2019t feel any need to be impatient anymore.</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s growth was accelerated when her insecurity and doubt disappeared. However, it could be called ironic.</p><br/><p>That is, something than even Shion wasn\u2019t unable to notice....</p><br/><p>The \u201cEnvy\u2019s Sprout\u201d that budded inside Shion\u2019s heart once again showed some change.</p><br/><p>At the same time as her insecurity and doubt disappeared, the envious feeling towards others was also dispelled.</p><br/><p>The outcome of this was that the budding sprout in a surge, turned back into a seed and fell asleep in her innermost heart.</p><br/><p>And thus, the budding of Shion\u2019s feelings of envy ceased.</p><br/><p>The seed did not vanish when it assimilated with the soul, it blended together with the wavelength of her soul, and engraved the beat.</p><br/><p>Did the envy not bud because her anxiety and doubt disappeared? Or did her anxiety and doubt disappear because she no longer goes mad with jealousy? It was uncertain.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Shion changed and arrived at the present state.</p><br/><p>Next, what Hakurou had released was without doubt a Sword Saint\u2019s Sword Draw Arts.</p><br/><p>If someone was able to stop the attack then there was a good chance of winning, it was the weak point of Sword Draw.</p><br/><p>The winner and loser would be decided by this one strike.</p><br/><p>Shion devoted her entire body and soul and made a posture to prepare against Hakurou\u2019s attack. </p><br/><p>\u300cDim Stream Slash[4]!\u300d(Hakurou)</p><br/><p>Hakurou\u2019s figure become indistinct, thin like air, despite the fact that Shion\u2019s perception was not inferior in speed, it was obstructed for a moment and before she realized it, he had already appeared before her eyes like an optical illusion.</p><br/><p>The shining blade was flowing as if it would cut through the neck,Hakurou\u2019s victory seems to be confirmed.</p><br/><p>\u300cNot yet! \u201cWar Goddess Release[5]\u201d!!\u300d(Shion)</p><br/><p>Shion transforms by utilizing the Unique Skill\u300eWar Goddess Transformation [6]\u300f.</p><br/><p>When the doubt inside Shion disappeared, the skill\u300eDemonification\u300fchanged into\u300eWar Goddess Transformation\u300f.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not a skill where someone loses their awareness and rage like a berserker. It\u2019s an ability that purely raised physical power.</p><br/><p>Just like Benimaru\u2019s\u300eDemon Flame Transformation[7]\u300f, it was an ability where they\u2019re able to use the properties of their soul body.</p><br/><p>Shion is in a state where her body\u2019s strength was transferred into her soul body without any change. However, it consumes an extreme amount of energy, so it can\u2019t be used for a long time.</p><br/><p>This moment is when the decision concluding this offence and defense is made.</p><br/><p>With her current self, she can\u2019t match Hakurou. That\u2019s why, she use all of her ability. </p><br/><p>Under the effect of Unique Skill\u300eWar Goddess Transformation\u300f a fierce and powerful Touki overflows from Shion\u2019s entire body. </p><br/><p>All her senses are sharpened at the same time and the power overflowing from Shion can be felt.</p><br/><p>The current Shion is able to clearly see Hakurou\u2019s \u201cDim Current Slash\u201d that could even confuse one\u2019s speed perception.</p><br/><p>Evasion is unnecessary.</p><br/><p>She will not receive damage from that katana. Shion understood that in an instant.</p><br/><p>However, Shion chose to respond to it with her greatest technique without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u300cChaoticThe Apocalypse and Genesis of FateLife and Death of the Universe[8]!!\u300d(Shion)</p><br/><p>Putting her whole will in it, it could even alter the outcome.</p><br/><p>She twists her body while sending her \u014cdachi from below and intercept Hakurou\u2019s blade.</p><br/><p>Hakurou\u2019s blade that was aimed to slash at Shion\u2019s neck was intercepted by Shion\u2019s \u014cdachi.</p><br/><p>Despite that there wasn\u2019t even a chance for it to make it in time, Shion\u2019s accelerating sword speed broke common sense and overwrote the result.</p><br/><p>Light flickers, and a broken edge flew in the air.</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s \u014cdachi beat and cut Hakurou\u2019s training katana.</p><br/><p>Shion quickly retracted her blade and swung down with her overhead raised \u014cdachi</p><br/><p>A clear voice with high pitched tone could be heard as Shion\u2019s \u014cdachi was stopped by the Magic Sword \u201cTenma\u201d [9] in Milim\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cStop! Any more than this is prohibited. This match shall be Shion\u2019s victory!\u300d(Milim)</p><br/><p>Milim proclaimed Shion\u2019s victory with an expression as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Shout of joy wrapped the Colosseum.</p><br/><p>Milim interrupted the match and stopping Shion\u2019s sword, few people noticed the real situation.</p><br/><p>But, Hakurou and Shion simultaneously understood. If she continued her slash, Hakurou might receive a fatal damage that couldn\u2019t be reversed even with regeneration.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry......Hakurou. I want you to see my growth, unconsciously I.....\u300d (Shion)</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat~ I don\u2019t really mind. I also wanted to see your seriousness. No, I\u2019ve already seen enough.\u300d(Hakurou)</p><br/><p>Hakurou forgives Shion when she apologizes.</p><br/><p>Towards those two,</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, you who is called Shion. I will personally teach you next time.</p><br/><p>You should be pleased! That strike just now was a strike that could even slay Demon Lord you know!\u300d(Milim)</p><br/><p>So Milim says.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, no, I need to decline. After all, I\u2019m not that really interested in becoming strong.\u300d(Shion)</p><br/><p>As one would expect, Shion decline if her opponent is the Tyrant Milim, and chose to escape.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say!? You should take the responsibility for chipping my Magic Sword \u201cTenma\u201d!\u300d(Milim)</p><br/><p>Milim made a fuss, but if she minds it then she\u2019s already lost.</p><br/><p>Shion made the right choice, resolute on making a speedy escape from the arena.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it\u2019s not chipped, its only degraded by rust. There is no problem.</p><br/><p>For becoming an important JudgeReferee for today, thank you very much.\u300d(Shion)</p><br/><p>After she said that, Shion started to flee and quickly left that place.</p><br/><p>Milim had face that say \u201cHum!?\u201d she began to laugh as if she gave up on it.</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s laugh reverberates in the Colosseum. This match\u2019s victory goes to Shion.</p><br/><p>The winner of final match on the third tournament day is Shion.</p><br/><p>With this, the best 4 people are all present.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>I was surprised.</p><br/><p>Shion was able to confront Hakurou directly, but I was more surprised by her victory.</p><br/><p>However, what surprised me the most is Milim who read the situation and intervened.</p><br/><p>I think that If Milim\u2019s intervention didn\u2019t come, Hakurou would be dead. It\u2019s good that she intervened.</p><br/><p>\u300cMIlim, You really helped me by stopping Shion there, thank you!\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>When I say my thanks,</p><br/><p>\u300cWahahahaha! What~ It was a good thing.</p><br/><p>However, your subordinate called Shion, that one is growing up.</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t need to be worried about that Guy fellow!\u300d(Milim)</p><br/><p>So she answered with laugh,</p><br/><p>\u300cThe thing is, will I also make a live report tomorrow?\u300d(Milim)</p><br/><p>So she demands from me while inclining her head, a smile on her face.</p><br/><p>She will not accept a refusal.</p><br/><p>*Glimpse* I glance at Souka, </p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood. Then Milim-sama, let\u2019s us both make a live report together!\u300d(Souka)</p><br/><p>It seems Souka will not yield in this.</p><br/><p>Well, whatever. Perhaps something will happen tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Milim and Souka, I acknowledge that those two would perform the live report for tomorrow\u2019s matches.</p><br/><p>The schedule for the fourth day,</p><br/><p>The thirteenth match....... Benimaru vs Gobuta (+Ranga)</p><br/><p>The fourteenth match...... Shion vs Diablo</p><br/><p>Also, the match to decide the 3rd place.</p><br/><p>Well, what will happen?</p><br/><p>We left to go home while thinking about tomorrow\u2019s outcome.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>In the night.</p><br/><p>The meal with the Hero Masayuki that been delayed was achieved.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it was not such grandiose thing.</p><br/><p>\u300cWa, it\u2019s nice to meet you, is it fine? I\u2019m the Hero (LOL) Masayuki.......\u300d (Masayuki)</p><br/><p>While blushing, Masayuki introduces himself as a Hero.</p><br/><p>Yeah. If he still had the original world\u2019s sense, there\u2019s no one who would not be embarrassed when calling oneself a Hero.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just like the feeling of when you\u2019re called and made fun as a muscle-brained Hero inside a game.</p><br/><p>And, he called me out when we meet before. </p><br/><p>At that time, he was still under Yuuki\u2019s brainwashing, but he remembered that the response can\u2019t be taken back. Therefore it seems to have become an unpleasant feeling.[10]</p><br/><p>After all, I\u2019m a Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>As the opponent, I can be considered a boss that needed to be defeated</p><br/><p>I think his mental state can be called very complex now.</p><br/><p>However, such a sick feeling should be cleared if I prepared a meal to eat together.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, although this is not our first meeting, \u201cnice to meet you[11]\u201d, should do.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m Demon Lord Rimuru. My real name is Mikami Satoru. I\u2019m a former salary man.\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>So, I first spoke frankly to ease the mood.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve spoken that abandoned name, but it flowed more nicely than I thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? By any chance... are you a Japanese person? \u300d(Masayuki)</p><br/><p>Oh well, my looks is a pretty girl.[12] It\u2019s natural if he doesn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, yes. Shall we talk about it while we eat?\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>I said so and invited him to a meal.</p><br/><p>Masayuki is deeply moved because of the sushi and udon displayed in front of his eyes, we\u2019ll be able to have a decent conversation after the meal.</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand. It\u2019s okay if I become Mikami-san\u2019s subordinate!\u300d(Masayuki)</p><br/><p>Although I still not said anything yet, he said such words as soon as we finished eating.</p><br/><p>What did you understand? I completely don\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>No well......., although I can understand that he\u2019s starved for Japanese food.</p><br/><p>\u300cSubordinate, you are.....\u300d(Rimuru)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it\u2019s okay. Because, I don\u2019t has any attachments for something like Hero.</p><br/><p>To be frank, it\u2019s embarrassing to be called\u300eMasayuki\u300f[13].</p><br/><p>No, actually, I was troubled how should I resign you know.\u300d(Masayuki)</p><br/><p>So he starts talking freely.</p><br/><p>He told me that he attended college prep-schools[14] back in the former world and was also a bright honor student.</p><br/><p>His secret and hidden hobby was that he liked to read Manga and Light Novels, but thanks to that he had the desire to become a hero, so he complained about this.</p><br/><p>After that, we talked about various things and explained about each other\u2019s circumstances. </p><br/><p>Well, I only talked a bit, I almost became an expert at listening.</p><br/><p>It seems he really wanted to talk, he explained lengthily and in great detail.</p><br/><p>It seems Masayuki was unable to speak what was inside his mind, because his companions worshipped him as if he was a God.</p><br/><p>With such circumstances, he seemed to have piled up a lot of stress.</p><br/><p>I also heard about Yuuki in detail.</p><br/><p>Oh well, as I expected. I seemed to have received the\u300eThought Guidance\u300fthat was the first stage of brainwashing, I attained some proof.</p><br/><p>Thought I had doubts if there was complete mind domination, but this was also inside my prediction.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s difficult to perform complete mind domination on several people at the same time, this was what I had reasoned.</p><br/><p>About Will Domination, is preferable for useful people that had Unique Skill, as it is difficult to dominate them since people with ability usually had a strong Will.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s necessary to affect them when their ability hasn\u2019t reached a mature stage.</p><br/><p>\u300cStill,\u300eThought Guidance\u300f, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>I had memories when I receive it, but it was also the truth that he had helped me.</p><br/><p>Instead of shameful memories, it could have ended worse.</p><br/><p>However, thanks to that, I could faint if I try to remember it......</p><br/><p>As expected, I can\u2019t forgive that guy\u300d(Masayuki)</p><br/><p>If he is recognized as hero, then he had mastered the ability as it was.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s also okay, but it seems that the memory is embarrassing.</p><br/><p>Well, there is nothing that can be done except to forget it. Although, he will faint in agony for awhile.</p><br/><p>In the end, Masayuki promised to cooperate with me.</p><br/><p>Since, it\u2019s also profitable to get information from him.</p><br/><p>When he could remember he would contact me, so for the moment he would continue to stay in my city.</p><br/><p>Above all, I still had business with his MangaMemory.</p><br/><p>He\u2019ll become my conversation partner for awhile.</p><br/><p>Thus, the friendship between me and Masayuki was created and I obtained a new companion.</p><br/><p>[1] To refresh our mind, the kanji for ogre is  Dai Oni Zoku \u2013 Great/Large Demon Race while the furigana is Ouga \u30aa\u30fc\u30ac.

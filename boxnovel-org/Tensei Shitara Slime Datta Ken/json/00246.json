This Is really unexpected.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect it, really\u2026\u2026. You\u2019d be the most dangerous of all.</p><br/><p>Bravo, Rimuru-san.</p><br/><p>I really did want to end the world with my own hands.</p><br/><p>But, unfortunately\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>I really can\u2019t imagine myself winning against you. Not to mention, even that Demon over there\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Your power is just too insane. That chills I got when we first met was right on the money.</p><br/><p>I should have ended you back then.</p><br/><p>Did I lose my marbles somewhere? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter at all now.</p><br/><p>No, in fact, if you can stop me, that\u2019d just be the will of the world.</p><br/><p>I guess, will decide the rest, heh.</p><br/><p>Goodbye, Rimuru-san</p><br/><p>I kinda liked you a bit too.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Honestly, we could\u2019ve been friends, you know\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>I ended up honestly trusting those words.</p><br/><p>He changed into Velda at the end with those words and I thought that Yuuki had told me his true intention.</p><br/><p>However, I was wrong.</p><br/><p>It was already too late at this point.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, he had started since we first met\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>I must admitted that he acted splendidly, I was even outwitted.</p><br/><p>Although Ciel seemed to have doubts about it, she couldn\u2019t find any definite fault.</p><br/><p>I was gullible enough to believe Yuuki\u2019s words; on the contrary, she had said that she suspected that it was some kind of a ruse.</p><br/><p>While I laughed it off that she might be overthinking it, but if it meant something, what was it? The two of us made the prediction over it.</p><br/><p>That answer we concluded was \u201cIsn\u2019t his goal for the 1 month delay to buy himself some time?\u201d or something like that.</p><br/><p>And, that was the right answer, Yuuki gradually made the power as his own inside Velda.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou-you\u2019ve deceived me until the end to buy yourself some time\u2026\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAhaha, you\u2019ve figured it out? 100 points for you, Rimuru-san. Well, it seems that Velda was completely deceived about that too. Hey, there\u2019s a saying \u201cTo fool the enemy, first deceive your allies\u201d after all, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStop with your bullshit, I really believed you\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHaha, that what they called as na\u00efve, you know. For you to believe the words of your enemy, your mind is really simple you know, Rimuru-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki mockingly shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Looking at him, Diablo and Milim gnashed their teeth while shooting nothing but death glares towards Yuuki. However, the aura emanated from Yuuki which was incomparable from before, coerced and made them unable to move their body at all.</p><br/><p>What a terrifying growth\u2015\u2015No, evolution.</p><br/><p>Our weapons were on equal terms, but I felt mine was inferior.</p><br/><p>Veldanava Sword didn\u2019t budge even after it was struck by Veldora Sword.</p><br/><p>And, Yuuki who wielded it skillfully parried the impact unlike Velda.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow did you get this much power?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t feel I need to tell you, but well I did make you wait for 1 month, I guess I could tell that much. It\u2019s really simple; I just suppressed Velda and turned him into my subordinate. After I fully analyzed his power, I also completely analyzed Velda\u2019s knowledge and understood all of it. Thanks to that, I could easily get the power of an awakened Hero too. Lucky for me, I also stole some of Leon\u2019s power. After that, I just changed our relationship from fifty-fifty relation into a complete domination with me in charge. Oh yeah, it was easy because Rimuru-san had crushed Velda\u2019s hope and broke his heart. Thanks for that.\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki replied smilingly.</p><br/><p>I regretted asking as what this guy said didn\u2019t always meant the truth.</p><br/><p>I was curious and unintentionally asked, but I could get deceived again if I carelessly speak with him.</p><br/><p>Although I had pompously reprimanded Mai, it was unfunny as I got myself deceived too. Talking more than this with him was dangerous and I would rather concentrate on the fight with my full power.</p><br/><p>\u300aI assume that Yuuki\u2019s words just now are true, but I agree that talking more than this is dangerous.\u300b</p><br/><p>Ciel seemed to have sensed the danger too and agreed with my opinion.</p><br/><p>A top class trickster was so troublesome to deal with.</p><br/><p>As I took pride that I wouldn\u2019t be deceived easily, I felt angry that I ended up being led around by the nose by someone. However, if I got caught it in too much, it would lead to a great failure.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t really laugh at Mai with this.</p><br/><p>From our conversation just now, Yuuki had said that he got the power of an awakened Hero. Then, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for him to have the power of an awakened demon lord too even if he didn\u2019t say it.</p><br/><p>After all, his subordinate, Kazaream was also an awakened demon lord.</p><br/><p>Hero and Demon Lord, powers of different natures were united in the same Will called Velda, and a being who could control that power as it pleased\u2015\u2015that would be what Yuuki had become now.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, it was clear that the current Yuuki had an equal power to me.</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, for Rimuru-san to be the one who had\u300eRaphael\u300f. I had thought that was possible, but just as I expected. Since my plan didn\u2019t work out smoothly, I suspected you might have anticipated them. However, I didn\u2019t expect the Skill that Velda was looking for was in the hand of Rimuru-san, his biggest enemy. This has really made Velda look like a clown. He\u2019s so laughable, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>As soon as I thought about ending our conversation, Yuuki spoke as if to block me from doing so.</p><br/><p>I heard a pleasant tone echoed from Yuuki\u2019s voice as if he sincerely thought that Velda was hilarious.</p><br/><p>What a tough opponent.</p><br/><p>I parried Yuuki\u2019s sword and slashed him back while keeping my mouth shut.</p><br/><p>\u300cAhaha. Don\u2019t be so wary like that. You see, Velda believed that he was Veldanava\u2019s reincarnation. There\u2019s no way that could be true, what a foolish guy. It was no more than an ability. It was Veldanava\u2019s original ability, so I had him inherit all of the memories. In other words, Velda was just a similar existence like Kondou and Damrada whom were called back with Memory Orb. He\u2019s a pathetic Manas that\u2019s even inferior to the irregular being like Rudra. What a fool, isn\u2019t he? A tool that didn\u2019t even have dragon factor and yet he misunderstood everything. However, even a fool like Velda was capable enough as a support for me. After all, I can control all of Veldanava\u2019s abilities now!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki kept on blabbering about things even though I wasn\u2019t asking, Was his plan was to confuse me with the conversation?</p><br/><p>However, his plan was actually quite successful.</p><br/><p>It was because it made me unable to concentrate very well. Even though we were in the midst of a fight, Yuuki\u2019s words disturbed my thoughts.</p><br/><p>Good grief, what a really troublesome guy he was.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, if what Yuuki had said was true, I could understand how he got the power equal to mine.</p><br/><p>It was probably true that Velda was a Manas. An existence that assisted all of your abilities was very helpful, just like Ciel-san.</p><br/><p>Even if it was a spell formulation with difficult control, it could activate it as your proxy. In other words, while you are concentrating in close combat like this, further attacks could be prepared without your opponent sensing it.</p><br/><p>However, I couldn\u2019t comprehend why Yuuki would bother to tell me that.</p><br/><p>I suspected the motive behind it whether it was also one of his plans. The existence of a Manas itself could be considered as a very important trump card that should be hidden, after all, I naturally felt the desire to find out his goal for telling me that.</p><br/><p>No, I suppose making me worried itself like this was what Yuuki expected, there would be no end if I kept on thinking about it.</p><br/><p>I earnestly reconfirmed that Yuuki was a very troublesome enemy for me.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou said that can control all of Veldanava\u2019s powers? Don\u2019t get conceited, you lowly human!\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy who was listening to me and Yuuki\u2019s conversation, shouted while glaring at Yuuki with his crimson eyes blazed with fury.</p><br/><p>As if they were following his lead, Velzard and Velgrind also nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right! In the first place, it was me who sealed Veldanava\u2019s holy corpse. As long as that seal not broken, there\u2019s no way someone like you can control all of the powers!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus, Ramiris instinctively shouted.</p><br/><p>When he heard that, Yuuki wickedly grinned and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Eh, wait a minute? Why did Ramiris blabber about such important information so easily like that? No matter how careless and scatterbrain Ramiris was, this was clearly strange\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cToo bad! Your seal was pointless. If I make you angry, why don\u2019t you release the seal and check it yourself?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t you dare make fun of me! Okay, let me do that\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>I was convinced when I saw Ramiris was about to respond to Yuuki\u2019s provocation.</p><br/><p>\u300cDiablo, stop Ramiris!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs you wish.\u300d</p><br/><p>Diablo moved promptly to my order.</p><br/><p>Gently, but assuredly.</p><br/><p>He locked up Ramiris, who was kicking up a fuss about something, inside the deployed Magic Barrier.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey! What is this, Rimuru!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCalm down, Yuuki\u2019s aim was for you to remove the seal, you know. Just now, you were acting according to his words.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHah!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I calmly answered to the shout of the dissatisfied Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Ramiris was speechless when she heard my explanation. That would be so. After all, she probably didn\u2019t have any recollection about it.</p><br/><p>If you only listened to the exchange of the words, it was unlikely for you to be tricked by the contents of the conversation. And yet, she unconsciously tried to act as Yuuki wanted. It was something unbelievable if you think about it calmly so I naturally thought that there was some kind of skill involved in this.</p><br/><p>It seemed I had to make sure about this.</p><br/><p>There was a possibility of me being manipulated too, but I decided to trust Ciel about this matter.</p><br/><p>\u300aPlease leave it to me. I will analyze Yuuki\u2019s skills.\u300b</p><br/><p>I spoke to Yuuki after I received the reply from the reliable Ciel.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015All this occurred while continuing to respond to the fierce sword blows without averting my sight from Yuuki.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re still a trickster as ever, Yuuki.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAhaha, what do you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t play dumb. You put Thought Guidance in your words and you could even trick those with a strong will. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s it not a technique on the level of suggestive or hypnotism or something like that. It\u2019s very impressive of you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh my, thank you. But, it\u2019s not fun now that you have seen through it though.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLike I care!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki dodged my words with his aloof attitude.</p><br/><p>Since he wasn\u2019t fazed by it, he seemed to have anticipated that things were to be seen through.</p><br/><p>Then, this meant Thought Guidance wasn\u2019t his trump card\u2026\u2026 it might be more reliable to deal with Yuuki\u2019s words by treating them all as lies.</p><br/><p>No, could it be that was his aim?</p><br/><p>If he mixed a bit of truth within the lies, he could make me under the impression that even the truths were lies too.</p><br/><p>Was it the reverse pattern of mixing a bit of lies into the truths\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u300aI think that\u2019s very likely. Unfortunately, I have analyzed the wavelength pattern of all his energy including his voiceprint, but I couldn\u2019t discern whether he\u2019s lying or telling the truth.\u300b</p><br/><p>Just as I suspected.</p><br/><p>However, it was a pain that even Ciel was unable to tell it apart. It would be certainly difficult as we couldn\u2019t read him even from his expressions or emotions.</p><br/><p>There was nothing that could be done about this\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, that meant I had no other choice but to judge it myself, what information that Yuuki would want me to believe that it was a lie?</p><br/><p>\u300aAdditionally, I\u2019ve confirmed that Yuuki\u2019s words harboured some kind of power. This is probably the Primitive Magic[1], \u201cPower of Words[2]\u201d. I presumed that Thought Guidance might have evolved.\u300b</p><br/><p>What? \u201cPower of Words\u201d\u2015\u2015you said!?</p><br/><p>I asked Ciel-san for more details, any kind of Primitive Magic was placed on a higher rank than the magic used by the Demons. She said that it was the source of all magic.</p><br/><p>However, its characteristic wasn\u2019t manipulating physical phenomenon, she told me that it had the power to affect the soul.</p><br/><p>While it had no effect on physical matters, its effect was tremendous inside the spiritual world.</p><br/><p>In other words, it was a terrifying magic that could exert its effect and invalidating defensive barriers. I was surprised that it could affect even strong people who had awakened Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>Also a being who could use this magic would become the natural enemy of any spiritual life-form.</p><br/><p>Just like how Ramiris easily got induced now, it could affect the inside of someone\u2019s heart\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>For now, our swordsmanship was on equal terms.</p><br/><p>Neither I nor Yuuki was being impatient, but neither of us had received any blows.</p><br/><p>Yuuki protected his whole body with a God Class Armor, but it wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand a hit from Veldora Sword.</p><br/><p>Likewise, I wasn\u2019t confident that I could withstand a hit from Veldanava Sword. After all, I felt energy surpassing Veldora Sword from that sword.</p><br/><p>Its power truly should be called as the incarnation of Veldanava\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, it can\u2019t be\u2015\u2015you really can control Veldanava\u2019s powers?\u300d</p><br/><p>My hunch told me so as if I received a divine revelation.</p><br/><p>The reason why Yuuki was buying himself time was probably to get enough power to beat us for sure.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, it was pretty logical that meant for him to obtain Veldanava\u2019s powers.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat the heck are talking about? There\u2019s no way that could be true.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, Rimuru. Like I said before, if the seal is not removed\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy and Ramiris were denying it, but Velzard and Velgrind were silent.</p><br/><p>Milim was silent as well.</p><br/><p>They probably had sensed it. The same surges as Veldanava\u2019s powers.</p><br/><p>It was the power overflowing from the sword Yuuki wielded.</p><br/><p>\u300cAha, ahahahahahahahahahaha!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki suddenly began to laugh as if the dam inside was now broken.</p><br/><p>He kept laughing while blocking the blows from my sword.</p><br/><p>Then\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu, bravo, Rimuru-san. There would be nothing at all even if that fairy over there had released the seal. I just wanted to see her face of despair when she did so. After all, it\u2019s true that I have broken the seal, you see.\u300d</p><br/><p>Everyone excluding me fell quiet as if they were frozen after they heard Yuuki\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>My intuition told me that he was telling the truth.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a lie to make me cautious. The reason was there was not much merit for him to tell such a lie.</p><br/><p>That meant Yuuki had broken Veldanava\u2019s seal in a month.</p><br/><p>And, the 1 month delay was for that purpose.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I wanted to see those faces. After all, I got really serious now. I may have lost the game to end the world using my tools, but wouldn\u2019t it be fine for me to have some fun until the end?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki was laughing as if he was having fun from the bottom of his heart right now.</p><br/><p>[1] \u306e(\u30d7\u30ea\u30df\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af) Gensho no Mah\u014d (Purimitibu Majikku).

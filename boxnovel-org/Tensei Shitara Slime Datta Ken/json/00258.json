What\u2019s interesting about this is that even though these monsters are fighting with each other, they haven\u2019t tried killing one another seriously and are maintaining the equilibrium of the island.</p><br/><p>There are probably still many monsters whose strength equals that of former demon lord level sleeping in different regions of the world just because they still do not have intelligence.</p><br/><p>This time, we just coincidentally found one of those monsters.</p><br/><p>Now then, what does Laplace plan on doing now?</p><br/><p>While feeling excited inside, I looked towards Laplace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I will have you lot become my underling but\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of us! Even we can fight seriously here. There\u2019s no one who would become you\u2014Guuahh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As we descended from the ship, Laplace began his speech.</p><br/><p>Students of different academies were lined up accordingly, with their instructor in front.</p><br/><p>Including the instructors and guards, there were more than 100 people there.</p><br/><p>Seems like there were about 30 people from each academy on board the plane.</p><br/><p>It was wise of them to obediently get down from the ship.</p><br/><p>After all, if by chance the ship got scratched or something, Laplace would surely go crazy.</p><br/><p>Well, they are probably thinking of using the ship after beating Laplace here so both parties are likely thinking of fighting away from the ship.</p><br/><p>And so, just as Laplace started his speech, one of the instructors interfered. As a result, he was silenced by a punch from Tia.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, there\u2019s quite a big gap in fighting skills among them and since it has already been 10 years since the big war, the instructors also got lax and so are no match for Laplace\u2019s team.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2014-Fuffuffufu. If you want to oppose me, you are more than welcome, you know? I will clearly show you the difference in our strength right here and now, how about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laplace provoked them, spreading both his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou piece of s.h.i.t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make light of us. We will show you our strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will protect you guys. Rest easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>And so they went on.</p><br/><p>While saying that, they took stance facing Laplace.</p><br/><p>As they handed over all their weapons, they were bare-handed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome forth, sky blade! Manifest! Origin magic: Create Weapon!!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the instructors splendidly created weapons and pa.s.sed them on to all the other instructors.</p><br/><p>Although the weapons have a time limit on them, they were quite strong since they reflected the strength of the user.</p><br/><p>Considering that instructor\u2019s skill, those are probably unique weapons with a 10 minute time limit on them.</p><br/><p>4 other instructors were battle types.</p><br/><p>And as soon as they all got a weapon, the fight had started.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t even need to say out the result.</p><br/><p>The instructors did try hard. Really hard.</p><br/><p>But, reality is just too harsh.</p><br/><p>These people who didn\u2019t even cross A rank were no match for even Tia alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-sensei!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-it can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026 Even Brown sensei\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Such gloomy cries of the students could be heard from here and there.</p><br/><p>It pains me to do this but I can\u2019t cut corners since this is all to correct the abnormality going on in the academies.</p><br/><p>I gave Laplace a small nod.</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu. As expected of me, super stroong~! Well, well? Are there any idiots left who still feel like disobeying me~?\u201d</p><br/><p>With pompous behaviour, he looked past the students and lightly \u2018overpowered\u2019 them.</p><br/><p>His appearance was now giving off a feeling of madness, fitting right into the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, well, now then, since we have all come to an understanding, I will have ya all wear this~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laplace gathered everyone\u2019s attention by snapping his fingers and brought out a bracelet.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a magic item called the parasite bracelet.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s an a.s.sisting tool made by the research team to help with conquering labyrinths and it displays the information of the person wearing it in numbers.</p><br/><p>It also quantifies the strength of the monster you defeat and was a trial product to make it easier to see one\u2019s score.</p><br/><p>It was made to record and quantify the monsters one defeated or the traps they undid.</p><br/><p>If the challengers have this on when they are trying to beat the labyrinth, when they die or return, they can easily see their total points.</p><br/><p>And we prepare freebies depending on that number.</p><br/><p>I remember such a project being brought up in the previous meeting.</p><br/><p>Laplace probably brought that item.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s perfect then. We can also have the bracelets\u2019 performance test.</p><br/><p>Also, Laplace\u2019s objective is also probably-</p><br/><p>\u201cNumbers are displayed on this bracelet. I can understand how you guys lived in this island with just a glance. I think you people probably understood how it works from just that but as I am really kind, I will properly explain! The first test you have to pa.s.s in order to become my subordinate is to survive one week in this island. But just surviving seems boring so I will also be cutting those off who have the lowest scores! Now, isn\u2019t it more interesting now? You do understand what I mean by cutting off, right? Well then, well then, this is the start of a fun, enjoyable survival gaameee~!\u201d</p><br/><p>His speech seems a bit off but I guess it\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>But it does seem like he completely fits into the role, as he explained jestingly.</p><br/><p>As I thought, he probably plans on motivating the students using this bracelets numbers.</p><br/><p>And before I knew it, Tia had gone around equipping the bracelet on each of their hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait! What do you mean if the number is low? At the very least, can\u2019t you tell us the minimum number we need to not get cut off?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oho? To ask a question in this situation-this student has guts.</p><br/><p>When I looked closely, I realized it was the red haired demi-human who flared up at the n.o.ble.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

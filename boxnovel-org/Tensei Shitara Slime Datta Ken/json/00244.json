That couldn\u2019t be helped since a human\u2019s ability to grasp space heavily relied on their eyesight.</p><br/><p>However, I could grasp a huge amount of spatial information, including with Observation Magic. That meant that I could teleport to places that I could recognize.</p><br/><p>I could learn about the situation through Diablo and Veldora-san\u2019s eyes now. That was the reason I could easily come to this place.</p><br/><p>I looked at Velda who was wary of my arrival and showed him a fearless smile.</p><br/><p>It was to provoke him.</p><br/><p>With that, it would increase Velda\u2019s wariness towards me. In that opportunity, I prepared myself in order to bring down Velda.</p><br/><p>Before Velda rushed into action, I absorbed the energy I had suppressed.</p><br/><p>I was fortunate that my energy recovery couldn\u2019t catch up and steadily absorbed it into my\u300eImaginary Space\u300f. In there, Ciel-san diligently converted it into energy I could use.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, I greatly recovered from my low energy state and it seemed to be enough to fight Velda.</p><br/><p>I guess you would never know what could turn out to be a fortunate situation.</p><br/><p>By the way, I found out the reason why my energy didn\u2019t recover when I came to this place.</p><br/><p>The culprit was probably Veldora-san.</p><br/><p>I think he created\u300eClones\u300fand rampaged around.</p><br/><p>It seemed he could replenish his energy through the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d from me, no mistake about that.</p><br/><p>I thought so, but\u2026...</p><br/><p>When I confirmed that with Ciel while being amazed, I heard a surprising answer.</p><br/><p>\u300aThat\u2019s right. In addition, a bit of it is also flowing into Diablo and Benimaru. More energy was used than expected for Velgrind's Skill Evolution.\u300b</p><br/><p>She replied in a carefree way like \u201cAnd so, what about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because she said it too smoothly, I was stuck on how to reply to that.</p><br/><p>No, no, she used my energy without my permission though\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>However, even if I wanted to complain, it was true that I was helped by the low energy state due to her doing.</p><br/><p>There was a heap of stuff that I wanted to say, but I gave up complaining.</p><br/><p>Or rather, perchance\u2026.. Even this situation was within Ciel-san\u2019s expectations?</p><br/><p>No, no, no, there\u2019s no way. I might indeed just be overthinking it.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be, right?</p><br/><p>There was no way she could predict things that far and predicted what kind of plan Velda would take either.</p><br/><p>\u300aI have confirmed the phenomenon of energy returning to Heaven[1] when the angels were defeated in various places.\u300b</p><br/><p>Yeah. I knew that.</p><br/><p>\u300aI have predicted that the most efficient way to use the energy of the angel gathered in the Heaven is to make all of the energy go berserk. Therefore, as the countermeasure for it, I have persisted your state of energy exhaustion.\u300b</p><br/><p>Well, you said it so easily, but\u2026\u2026 that, wouldn\u2019t that be a big problem if you misread things?</p><br/><p>Moreover, Velda might absorb all of the energy and super-powered up[2] himself.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t possibly fight Velda in an out of gas state like that, what were you going to do if the energy didn\u2019t recover smoothly?</p><br/><p>\u300aHe can\u2019t do such things as super-power up. He wouldn\u2019t be struggling if he could power up himself that easily. Well, even if he were to super-power up himself temporarily, there would be no problem. I don\u2019t think that My Master would lose in low energy state, but just in case, it was possible to forcibly retrieve Veldora and Velgrind back to recover about 60% of the energy instantly. So, there\u2019s no problem.\u300b</p><br/><p>Ah, I see.</p><br/><p>She declared that super-strengthening was impossible, but what about me?</p><br/><p>Am I an exception?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026 I felt Ciel-san had overestimated me too much.</p><br/><p>Ciel-san is the \u201cIf she says she\u2019ll do it, she\u2019ll do it\u201d type.</p><br/><p>So, she generously distributed the energy at a fast pace.</p><br/><p>Since Veldora-san and Velgrind were also recovering their own energy, certainly, it would be the best idea to have them cooperate with me in the worst case situation.</p><br/><p>Whether I would get their approval or not would become the problem, but I felt relieved to know that such way was available.</p><br/><p>I felt I got to see a glimpse of Ciel-san\u2019s scary side, but my doubt was cleared.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s left was only to defeat Velda.</p><br/><p>Also, before that\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I examined the orb remaining in my left hand.</p><br/><p>When I finished absorbing all of the energy, it seemed only the core remained.</p><br/><p>It resembled the pseudo-core I made, but the concept seemed to be quite different.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! I thought it was the end but I didn\u2019t think that I will survive in this form, you know? Although I can\u2019t really say that I\u2019m \u201calive\u201d. Hahahahaha!\u300d</p><br/><p>It talked!?</p><br/><p>I stared at the orb in surprise.</p><br/><p>Even though it had no vocal cords, it seemed to produce sounds by vibrating the magic essences. It was a very skilled orb.</p><br/><p>\u300cRudra! You are safe\u2026\u2026it doesn\u2019t seem so, but you were safe?\u300d</p><br/><p>Although Velgrind found herself stuck for words, she still asked the orb.</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026\u2026 This orb, is Rudra?</p><br/><p>I felt his character was completely different from the Rudra I knew though\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u300cHah! Well, being tenacious is my forte after all!\u300d</p><br/><p>No, no. Even if you called yourself as tenacious, your status as an orb was hard to be said as alive.</p><br/><p>At the moment I tried to do a carefree tsukkomi like that\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Velda instantly closed the distance and came to slash me.</p><br/><p>However, I didn\u2019t let my guard down even while talking, I kicked up the sword stuck in the ground, wielded it in my right hand, and I stopped Velda\u2019s sword with it.</p><br/><p>\u300cNa\u00efve! I don\u2019t underestimate you that much that I will let my guard down in this final stage, you know!\u300d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to compliment him, but it can\u2019t be helped as it was true.</p><br/><p>Velda was indubitably the strongest person as far as I knew.</p><br/><p>Judging from a brief look just now, his power was rising tremendously. I felt Guy\u2019s almightiness and Milim\u2019s strength, and the energy of \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d level.</p><br/><p>I also thought whether to attack him in the gap while he was wary of me, but stopping was the right decision. As expected, this guy wouldn\u2019t let his guard down, so I had to deal with him carefully. Besides\u2026\u2026I had just one concern.</p><br/><p>Since there was such a concern, I couldn\u2019t possibly do something such as letting my guard down.</p><br/><p>I exchanged several blows with Velda and took some distance from him.</p><br/><p>That just now wasn\u2019t even a warm-up, it was just a playful greeting.</p><br/><p>In the first place, I couldn\u2019t get used to fighting using a sword that wasn\u2019t mine as I expected. Or rather, this sword was an excellent weapon and obviously of God class too.</p><br/><p>From pure performance, this sword was better than my katana.</p><br/><p>Even so, I wouldn\u2019t cheat because the katana I was familiar with was easier to be used.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, You\u2019re not bad. You\u2019re able to handle my sword. However, you still have lots more to work on. Unfortunately, you don\u2019t seem to be my true vessel.\u300d</p><br/><p>The orb in my left hand proudly said such an evaluation.</p><br/><p>Or rather, what are you?</p><br/><p>Because of you, I was fighting Velda with just my right hand. Since the basic is to wield the sword with both hands, I was unfamiliar with fighting only using my right hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you supposed to be? The Rudra I know was full of himself because he was an emperor, but you\u2019re above him on that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. I did become an emperor, heh? Well, I guess I must have gotten \u201cmellowed out\u201d if I stopped at the status of an emperor though.\u300d[3]</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t care about that stuff and not interested. Like I said, what the heck are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>I ignored the complaint of the orb that started to talk about itself and asked the most important thing.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t leisurely fight Velda in front of me after all.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right! You are exactly like Rudra, but I can\u2019t think that you\u2019re just reproduced memories, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Reproduced memories?</p><br/><p>Velgrind\u2019s words piqued my interest.</p><br/><p>\u300aApparently, this orb has the effect of reproducing a dead person\u2019s memories. However, even if it can recreate a personality as close as the original, the soul is a different matter. It should be no more than a copy, but\u2015\u2015\u300b</p><br/><p>Yeah, it couldn\u2019t be said as reviving someone just by reproducing their memories.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s important for a soul is a heart.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s certainly very interesting. The Memory Orb that I made can only reproduce memories. There\u2019s no function such as recalling soul. If that was possible, there was no need for me to do troublesome stuff like this.\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda seemed to be interested in this phenomenon as well.</p><br/><p>Because he was well informed of the stuff he created, Rudra acquiring freewill itself was impossible.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahahahaahaahaahaa! It\u2019s that, you know. I was super excellent, or something like that I guess.\u300d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s ignore the boastful voice that could be heard from my left hand.</p><br/><p>Rudra certainly died.</p><br/><p>That was for sure, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300a\u2015\u2015Talking about a possibility, reincarnation may be one of the causes.\u300b</p><br/><p>Reincarnation? What did you mean by that?</p><br/><p>\u300aEmperor Rudra had his soul torn apart due to repeated reincarnations. It\u2019s possible that torn parts of the soul gathered together and became another soul. Neither an existing soul nor a temporary soul, it has a heart with a high degree of freedom.\u300b</p><br/><p>His soul was torn apart every time he reincarnated and gathered as one?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a bad example for an analogy, but is it like the residues of an eraser lumped together to make a kneaded eraser[4], or something like that?</p><br/><p>Treating a soul and an eraser as the same might be a problem though.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something you would normally think about, but I could hardly say that\u2019s absolutely impossible.</p><br/><p>After all, I got reincarnated as a slime which you would normally consider as impossible.</p><br/><p>So, because there was a person with fragments of Rudra\u2019s soul somewhere in this world that the Memory Orb embedded with the memories was able to reproduce Rudra\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>In that case\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>I suddenly hit on a good idea. And then, I carried out the idea as ordered by my mischievous heart.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru, what are you doing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaa, this is interesting!\u300d</p><br/><p>Velgrind confusedly raised her voice.</p><br/><p>Rudra felt it was interesting.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t really do anything great.</p><br/><p>I just threw the sword to Velgrind.</p><br/><p>I fused the Memory Orb in my left hand with the sword I held in right hand, though.</p><br/><p>I embedded the Memory Orb into the base of the hilt of the God Class Sword like a conspicuous shining jewel. Since I fused it so it became one with the sword, the orb part would be as strong as the sword.</p><br/><p>If there was really a reincarnated person who shared his soul, that person should be able to draw out Rudra\u2019s abilities by holding the sword.</p><br/><p>I made it that way so you could depend on it.</p><br/><p>In order to enable him to have conversation with the owner, I had also asked Ciel-sensei to remake and changed Rudra into a pseudo-Manas.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the information of the Memory Orb had been analyzed.</p><br/><p>\u300cI turned it into Intelligence Sword[5]. Because I fused Rudra\u2019s will and the sword, from now on only someone with the same soul wavelengths as him can use the sword. In other words, the person who has the qualification to wield the sword will be the proof that the person is Rudra\u2019s reincarnation. Interesting, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do things as you please!\u201d I thought that she would get angry like that, but Velgrind only took the sword into her embrace and stared at me.</p><br/><p>Rudra was laughing jovially.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahahahaha! Is that so, there\u2019s a possibility that I got reincarnated? I see that would explain why I got a free will! It\u2019s certainly interesting.\u300d</p><br/><p>So he laughed happily.</p><br/><p>Listening to Rudra\u2019s words, Velgrind gave a nod as if to agree with him.</p><br/><p>Velda was annoyed, but he glared at with an expression as if he was satisfied with something.</p><br/><p>He thought about the reason why his own plan failed and admitted that my\u2015\u2015or rather, Ciel\u2019s\u2015\u2015deduction was right, I guess.</p><br/><p>While Velda\u2019s attention was on the Intelligence Sword, I unsheathed my katana and took a stance.</p><br/><p>With this, I could fight seriously.</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, given that the Will of the super-excellent me remained a whole, I guess the person who might be my reincarnation now would surely be a cowardly fellow. I\u2019m looking forward to our meeting.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu, that might be so. The last thing left from Rudra at the end was only his charisma, not even his prided luck remained\u2026\u2026 But conversely, that person might only inherit that luck. I want to meet that person if that person exists. Your reincarnation, a cowardly and lucky person\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Velgrind nonchalantly said.</p><br/><p>A cowardly and lucky person\u2015\u2015? There was someone who matched that description, but it couldn\u2019t be, right.</p><br/><p>Although the person in question had no charisma, that person was compensated with incredible luck though\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sure that the ability that person had is called\u300eThe Chosen One\u300f\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a coincidence. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a coincidence.</p><br/><p>I ignored Rudra and Velgrind\u2019s conversation and abandoned any further thoughts.</p><br/><p>Fate would decide their encounter and if that person was really Rudra\u2019s reincarnation, they would eventually come across even if I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Besides, if my thoughts were right, that person probably wouldn\u2019t be able to run from Velgrind.</p><br/><p>Well, it didn\u2019t matter to me.</p><br/><p>I guess I did do some unnecessary things, but the rest was their problem</p><br/><p>I irresponsibly decided that Rudra and the others\u2019 matter would have nothing to do with me.</p><br/><p>Like that, it seemed I had succeeded in buying time.</p><br/><p>Velda was too wary of me and only attempted minor attacks.</p><br/><p>I easily parried them and waited until the preparation was completed.</p><br/><p>Then, finally\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWe did it, Rimuru! I and Gaia completely locked up the Heaven to another space!\u300d</p><br/><p>So I heard Ramiris\u2019 shout.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, good job! With this, we blocked your escape!\u300d</p><br/><p>This time for sure, I showed a triumphant smile towards Velda.</p><br/><p>It would be meaningless if we cornered him this far just for him to run away.</p><br/><p>Therefore, I brought Ramiris and Gaia\u2015\u2015\u201dEarth Sovereign Dragon\u201d Velgaia\u2015\u2015to the Heaven and asked them to lock this place completely.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for Ramaris because she had her own labyrinth, but it was demonstrated that Gaia could create a pseudo labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Under Ramiri\u2019s guidance, Gaia\u2019s labyrinth completely covered up this Heaven.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard, so that was your aim!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I could see the color of emotions for the first time in Velda\u2019s expressions.</p><br/><p>That agitation was exactly what I intended.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Ramiris and Gaia succeeded in rescuing Milim who got caught.</p><br/><p>\u300cKyui\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGaia! When did you become strong like this!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim was safely rescued and she seemed to be surprised with Gaia\u2019s growth.</p><br/><p>\u300cMission completed on this side, Rimuru! Go on and send that guy flying!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris proudly gave the \u201cGO\u201d sign towards me.</p><br/><p>In addition to her,</p><br/><p>\u300cTo be honest, I wanted to do it myself but unfortunately, I can\u2019t win. Rimuru, please avenge me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim said so.</p><br/><p>\u300cLeave it to me. I\u2019ll carve it properly into your body as the reward of laying your hands on my precious friends!\u300d</p><br/><p>I raised one hand to answer Milim and declared so towards Velda.</p><br/><p>Well then, since all of the trouble was sorted out, let\u2019s end this quickly.</p><br/><p>When I thought so\u2026..</p><br/><p>A terrific explosion was heard and a corner of the Heaven was blown away.</p><br/><p>I was surprised and turned my focus to that direction\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Just as I thought, I saw Veldora-san who became pitch black over there.</p><br/><p>[1] There were two kanji used for Heaven  Tenjoukai and  Tenkuukai. Ciel used the first one which can also mean Celestial World, while the other people use the 2nd one which would be closer to Sky World.  Tenkuu mean Sky but can also mean Heaven.

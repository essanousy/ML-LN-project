Also, call me sensei, Mondo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yes. Understood, Satoru-sensei.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to add that it was all a revenge plan for getting back at Julius for his poor treatment towards me.</p><br/><p>After all, the other students would just think they just got mixed up in it.</p><br/><p>Besides, it seems everyone is content with that answer so I will just go along with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, it seems like you guys were able to cool off your heads. Then let\u2019s start the strategy meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the meal, we gathered around by a camp fire to discuss strategy.</p><br/><p>Julius and Karma also seemed content with that explanation and didn\u2019t complain.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s weird for me to say this but they are quite simple.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s start.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst off all, lets talk about Magnus\u2019 strength. Is there anyone who realized the secret behind it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone seemed agitated in response to my question.</p><br/><p>Not only the students, but also the instructors.</p><br/><p>\u201cInstructors as well, if you noticed something, please speak up.\u201d</p><br/><p>I also urged the instructors to talk about their observation.</p><br/><p>Is there anyone who has noticed?</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it\u2026 Magnus was a very excelling guy but it didn\u2019t seem like he was hiding that amount of strength\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karma, who seemed to have been in good terms with him, muttered.</p><br/><p>I guess that\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>If someone has that amount of strength, a portion of it would show when they are taking the lessons.</p><br/><p>At the very least, even if the students didn\u2019t realize, the instructors would.</p><br/><p>If a instructor didn\u2019t even notice someone so strong, then they fail as an instructor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make excuses but I didn\u2019t think he would be that strong of a student.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRig\u2026ht. It didn\u2019t seem like he was hiding his strength, more like he suddenly gained strength\u2014or rather, it felt like he borrowed strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiddah, a combat type instructor of NNU muttered.</p><br/><p>Heinrich, who had been observing the combat agreed with him.</p><br/><p>As expected of researchers, they make good observations.</p><br/><p>\u201cBorrowed strength, you say? That makes it sound like\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSounds like Element Fusion?\u201d</p><br/><p>I cut off sage William.</p><br/><p>And the place fell silent at once.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s only natural too, since, Element Fusion is\u2013</p><br/><p>Using a superior elemental spirit, the final hidden technique for an elementalist</p><br/><p>\u2014after all.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s truly what can be said to be the strongest technique known to mankind, only permitted to those who are worthy of being called \u2018hero\u2019.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

It\u2019s not something a mere student can pull off!\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussion turned vigorous at once after that.</p><br/><p>A display of denial rather than a discussion.</p><br/><p>However, we won\u2019t get anywhere if we were to discuss things here.</p><br/><p>After all, even the instructors don\u2019t really comprehend what actually is Element Fusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down. I will first explain what Element Fusion exactly is.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I said that, the noisy ones went silent at once.</p><br/><p>They all turned to me in unison.</p><br/><p>The instructor group\u2019s gaze were more piercing than the related students.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, maybe we can get close to that secret ourselves\u201d\u2013it\u2019s clear that they were thinking as such.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s fine too.</p><br/><p>After all, it\u2019s not something you would be able to use immediately even if you were to understand it.</p><br/><p>\u201cElement Fusion is\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>And like that, I started my explanation.</p><br/><p>The most easy to comprehend example would be Shizu-san.</p><br/><p>She had fused with Ifreet and had transformed into a demon of flames.</p><br/><p>Although in Shizu-san\u2019s case, it was due to a unique skill called Deviate so she might be an exception.</p><br/><p>It would be extremely difficult for a normal person to fuse that much with an elemental spirit.</p><br/><p>Ifreet, the superior flame spirit, possesses energy equal to a semi-demon lord class.</p><br/><p>Fusing with that is basically becoming as strong as a semi-demon lord class while being human.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>If I were to give that a human rank, then it would be an A+.</p><br/><p>S rank is given to demon lords so that is the highest ranking.</p><br/><p>Anything above this can only be a \u2018hero\u2019.</p><br/><p>An existence completely opposite that of a demon lord\u2014those who can be said to be the strongest beings in humankind, also get the S rank.</p><br/><p>In fact, at this rank, it is also possible for a hero to fuse with the strongest elemental spirits, the light spirits.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s different from an awakened hero in sense.</p><br/><p>To awaken, one needs the \u201chero\u2019s egg\u201d and other factors also come into play so that\u2019s more complicated.</p><br/><p>At the very least, I haven\u2019t heard about Kenya\u2019s \u201chero\u2019s egg\u201d hatching.</p><br/><p>Although it does seem like he has acquired it.</p><br/><p>That \u2018blessing\u2019 thing Ramiris was talking about was a ceremony to ascertain the adaptability percentage with the spirit.</p><br/><p>The ones who can make the spirit\u2019s strength their own and use it freely are the strongest of these practitioners.</p><br/><p>Now then, about the ones below that\u2026</p><br/><p>Lower ranking Holy Knights would be a good example.</p><br/><p>They are the people who have become able to borrow a portion of the spirits\u2019 strength who are compatible with them.</p><br/><p>The mysterious power these spirits possess.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

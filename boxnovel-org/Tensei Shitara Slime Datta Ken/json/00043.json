That\u2019s just reckless. I mean, I had gone into a three day hibernation after naming merely five hundred goblins!</p><br/><p>By the time I name all 150 thousand, they\u2019d die from hunger!</p><br/><p>I was planning to just ignore it this time, but\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, I also need to devour their sins.</p><br/><p>And somehow, while they had risen up to rank C+, it seems that they\u2019ll be returning back to D in about two weeks.</p><br/><p>They were merely strengthened by the Orc Lord\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>And once they lose their magic energy I will eat it and bestow it back upon them. Thus, I will be able to name them without tiring needlessly.</p><br/><p>So there is no problem in naming them\u2026 except that I\u2019ll run out of simple letter combinations.</p><br/><p>Even if I give start giving out the same names in different districts, managing the process will be a pain.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only one thing to do, the most extreme and supreme method. I will name them based on a series with infinite potential!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! Numbers!</p><br/><p>Sounds too much like a citizen\u2019s registration number? Well, frankly, this is the most efficient method.</p><br/><p>Since they are able to at least line up in formation, I had them line up in the marshes.</p><br/><p>Would they hate being named on a whim?</p><br/><p>I had that passing thought, but once the magical energy disappears, they\u2019ll devolve into an uncontrollable mob of 150 thousand.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s too many to let loose.</p><br/><p>Being only a D rank, they would\u2019t pose much of a threat; however, I can see them breaking into private property.</p><br/><p>Besides, as they are, I can\u2019t expect much of their work skills, making the coalition rather pointless.</p><br/><p>Also, if they evolve, their status increases and their reproductive ability decreases\u2013that much we know from the time I named the goblins.</p><br/><p>Thus, I\u2019ll be exercising victor\u2019s rights here.</p><br/><p>The great clans shall be separated by their names: Yama (mountain) , Oka (hill), Hora (cave), Umi (sea), Kawa (river), Ko (lake), Mori (forest), Kusa (grass), and Suna (sand).</p><br/><p>For example, a man from the mountains would be \u201cYama-1M\u201d. A woman wouldbe \u201cYama-1F\u201d. That\u2019s how I would diversify their names.</p><br/><p>Honestly, managing this will still be a pain. For kids I decided to go with something like \u201cYama-1-1M\u201d, for example.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it would be more appropriate to give with some name or letter combination instead, but I\u2019ll leave that to them for new names.</p><br/><p>And thus, I absorbed their magical energy, and gave them names instead.</p><br/><p>I first aligned them by clan, then separated them by gender, and began giving them names; as you\u2019d expect, it took a while.</p><br/><p>However, I was able to give them all names without worrying endlessly.</p><br/><p>They were given names by their place in the line. I didn\u2019t try to match names for parents and children.</p><br/><p>They should just name themselves if unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>In this fashion, I went on naming them all.</p><br/><p>I then had the clan representatives conduct a census. But since they had no paper, it was only to make sure no mistakes were made.</p><br/><p>But in reality, there was nothing to worry about\u2013those named could hardly forget it.</p><br/><p>Unlike humans, monsters always know the name etched on their soul.</p><br/><p>I thus started to give and each one of them a name.</p><br/><p>Taking no more than five second per person.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 giving each one a name still took 10 days.</p><br/><p>Of course, while I was naming them without rest, I couldn\u2019t just have Benimaru and the rest having fun.</p><br/><p>I had the Dryad Trainee escort them to the Treant\u2019s community.</p><br/><p>In order to transport the food.</p><br/><p>Would it really be enough to feed 150 thousand? While I had such worries, I could only trust in her words.</p><br/><p>At the very least, I hope there is enough to last them a year.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t worry about the carriers at all.</p><br/><p>The fundamental worry of war is logistics, after all. Allowing the front line to starve welcomes defeat.</p><br/><p>No matter how much of a demon each one of them is, carrying enough food for all the orcs must be difficult.</p><br/><p>However!</p><br/><p>The Storm Wolves, the moment Ranga had evolved into Tempest Star Wolf, had evolved into Star Wolves.</p><br/><p>Each one is at least a B rank now. A high ranking monster.</p><br/><p>Their numbers are still at one-hundred, but they have unlocked a Star Leader evolution variation.</p><br/><p>And let\u2019s not forget to mention that they can all use \u300eShadow Step\u300fnow.</p><br/><p>They can\u2019t move instantaneously like Souei or Ranga do, but they can easily move faster than sound.</p><br/><p>And they now move ignoring any obstacle\u2013straight to their target.</p><br/><p>Closing long distance with every step, they are moving at three times their original speed. In short\u2013really quickly.</p><br/><p>So I also had the strong Star Wolves handle ferrying the provisions over.</p><br/><p>If we used a carriage, the trip \u2013 with a necessary detour \u2013 would take two months; this way, a round drip takes only a day.</p><br/><p>However, the Goblin riders cannot journey with them.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if this is something they can learn through practice, but I want them to try.</p><br/><p>So having remained with me, the Goblins are helping arranging the orcs.</p><br/><p>Thus, we came up with a method to procure food.</p><br/><p>Which lead me to worry about food reserves\u2026</p><br/><p>I mean, Treants are monsters who survive on water, sunlight, and air alone.</p><br/><p>They would grow fruits using their magical energy, but there was no one to eat them.</p><br/><p>They were meant for the race residing in the holy lands, but the immortal race just had them accumulate.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the fruit being magical, it does not rot no matter how much time passes.</p><br/><p>By the way, as I learned later, this fruit is sold as a rare ingredient called \u201cDried Treant\u201d in human markets.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s really hard to find and can be sold for a large amount of money.</p><br/><p>The reason for the price is its abundant magical energy. Just one drop can keep you going for seven days. Without feeling hunger.</p><br/><p>Another reason for the high price is the fact that Treants don\u2019t interact with other races, and the troublesome Dryads, who manage this product, give it out sometimes as a present.</p><br/><p>When I learned this fact, I had mild regrets about giving it out to the orcs for free\u2026 but it is what it is.</p><br/><p>And thus, thanks for Dryad Trainee\u2019s guidance, we were able to acquire food.</p><br/><p>Ten days later.</p><br/><p>Exhausted, I finished.</p><br/><p>I almost ran out of numbers to use. Tired.</p><br/><p>However, I was also filled with a sense of accomplishment.</p><br/><p>150 thousand? Just counting that high is annoying.</p><br/><p>Well, by the time I finished naming them, we also finished dividing up the food.</p><br/><p>Fifty pieces each.</p><br/><p>The probably understand that when they run out they starve. So everyone wore serious expressions when accepting the fruit.</p><br/><p>After being named, the orcs evolved into high orcs. But since they weren\u2019t named using my magical energy, there was no master-servant relationship between us.</p><br/><p>Everything rests on their sincere promise to join and support our coalition.</p><br/><p>Their strength did reach up to C+ immediately after evolving, but they settled comfortably in the C rank zone. Considering they were D ranks originally, this should be good enough.</p><br/><p>More importantly, they have gotten smarter while preserving their special characteristics.</p><br/><p>They evolved into a race that can adapt to and make use of any situation.</p><br/><p>After thanking me, they dispersed each to their lands. Overseeing this were 10 goblin riders per group.</p><br/><p>Once they confirm the location, we plan to assist them with setting up tents. And, guiding them on necessary skills, we will set up each and every community.</p><br/><p>Though this won\u2019t be for a while, but they\u2019ll eventually settle down, and their living standards should improve.</p><br/><p>Thus, we saw the orcs off.</p><br/><p>Which reminded of a certain individual.</p><br/><p>The Orc General insisted that I work him to my pleasure.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>I did want another laborer.</p><br/><p>Ah, whatever. Let\u2019s just let him in.</p><br/><p>I also need to figure out what to do with the black full plate armor clad, two-thousand strong elite orc army.</p><br/><p>Them I cannot name using a district. What should I do\u2026</p><br/><p>Since they have a yellow aura about them, I decided to name them using a color and numbers.</p><br/><p>I glance over the orc army. And, have them line up according to my wishes.</p><br/><p>Recently, I can use my\u300eGreat Sage\u300f\u2019s appraisal ability simply by looking.</p><br/><p>Just like Shuna does.</p><br/><p>As expected of \u300eGluttony\u300f\u2019s Food Chain ability. It\u2019s super effective!</p><br/><p>And so I named (assigned numbers to) everyone, except the Orc General.</p><br/><p>Thus the later famous Yellow Corps was born. Numbers assigned indiscriminately of gender.</p><br/><p>Since there could be no gender inequality among fellow warriors.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll be later dispatching them to every community as production workers. At the present, there\u2019s no choice but to have them do this kind of work.</p><br/><p>Now, about the Orc General.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m going to ignore any feeling of foreboding.</p><br/><p>And decide on a name.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll incorporate the Orc Lord\u2019s ambition, the one he got from Gelmudo. Just thinking about that Clown\u2019s face makes me angry, but to the orcs he\u2019s an important benefactor.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t care much about his expectations, and I don\u2019t have anything to base it on.</p><br/><p>So, the name I will bestow upon him,</p><br/><p>\u300cWith respect given to Orc Disaster\u2019s dying wish, you shall henceforth be known as Gerudo!\u300d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Orc General\u2019s body was enveloped in a yellow aura, and he began evolving.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, I lost a lot of magical energy. Crap\u2026 so it really came to this.</p><br/><p>As always, I entered a lowered activity state (Sleep Mode).</p><br/><p>And the following day,</p><br/><p>Should I say \u201cjust as expected\u201d or something? My premonition was spot on.</p><br/><p>The Orc Elite has all evolved into High Orcs.</p><br/><p>Though they possessed strength almost surpassing C+ rank, they were able to retain that level. All in all, they have evolved into rather powerful warriors.</p><br/><p>Considering that Goblin Riders are also ranked C+, I seem to have acquired a rather powerful army.</p><br/><p>Well, though Goblin Riders are ranked thus, they really should be evaluated together with the Star Wolves.</p><br/><p>So perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be comparing them.</p><br/><p>Now then, the problematic Orc General, or rather, Gerudo\u2026</p><br/><p>He had gained the unique skill \u300eGourmet\u300fwith abilities\u300cStomach, Supply, and Demand\u300d.</p><br/><p>His magic energy is also pretty high, almost reaching A rank.</p><br/><p>As expected, he no longer has any of the abilities he got from cannibalizing. Simply because he has no need for them.</p><br/><p>This skill he got probably because he wished for it from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>Perhaps because he had endured the pain and suffering, he became such a rational and dignified monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I be satisfied with such a subordinate?\u201d I had such a fleeting thought, but decided to ignore it.</p><br/><p>If he desired to go on independent, I would permit it.</p><br/><p>Though he doesn\u2019t seem to want to do that.</p><br/><p>And perhaps the Death March has finally come to an end.</p><br/><p>Was all their suffering up until now the effect of Gelmudo\u2019s skill\u2013that I wouldn\u2019t know. Perhaps that clown was actually a really powerful guy.</p><br/><p>I joked to myself.</p><br/><p>The goblin soldiers have finally returned. Their numbers greatly reduced, with only 4,000 survivors.</p><br/><p>Are they okay? I worried slightly. But, this is their problem and not something I will intervene in.</p><br/><p>Too much intervention would be harmful to them.</p><br/><p>Now then, should we take our leave?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s return the control of this area back to the lizardmen, say our farewells to the Head, and head of.</p><br/><p>Though our time hear was a mere three weeks, this war felt rather long.</p><br/><p>I myself seem to have fought alone for a long time.</p><br/><p>The forest disturbance story thus comes to an end.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Gabil was brought before the Lizardmen\u2019s Head, his father.</p><br/><p>The moment the fighting ended, he was thrown into prison.</p><br/><p>His was fed every morning and every evening, but no one had said anything. This kind of lifestyle continued on for two weeks.</p><br/><p>After all, he was a rebel. That much was true.</p><br/><p>While he acted in what he believed was everyone\u2019s best interests, his foolishness almost annihilated the entire race.</p><br/><p>It was his fault.</p><br/><p>He had no excuses to say, nor any desire to come up with any.</p><br/><p>He would probably face the death penalty. A fact he accepted. But\u2026</p><br/><p>Gelmudo who had betrayed him. Ignoring that fact, the Slime who had saved him.</p><br/><p>A lowly monster. That\u2019s how he referred to the slime.</p><br/><p>While that was not a mistake, it also was.</p><br/><p>That Slime is special.</p><br/><p>Unique and Named, a truly special monster.</p><br/><p>If he could have one final wish, he\u2019s want to ask.</p><br/><p>Why did you save me?</p><br/><p>The mislead, worthless me. A complete idiot.</p><br/><p>That thought was on his mind every day for two weeks.</p><br/><p> He stood before his father.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere heavy, they looked each other in teh eye.</p><br/><p>A father who, as usual, did not show his emotion. Ah\u2026 death penalty, huh?</p><br/><p>He agreed.</p><br/><p>A leader cannot show weakness. He must uphold law at all cost.</p><br/><p>So there\u2019s no way he could hate him.</p><br/><p>He resolved himself to quietly accept his punishment.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will pass judgment! Gabil, you are exiled. You are forbidden to ever call yourself a Lizardman.</p><br/><p>Further, you are forbidden to ever return. Leave! Show your face among us no longer!\u300d</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>What did he say?</p><br/><p>His father\u2019s guards lead him by the arms outside the caves.</p><br/><p>The Head threw him out.</p><br/><p>And to the confused Gabil,</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t forget this! Don\u2019t lose it, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>He was told, an something was thrown to him.</p><br/><p>Along with his things, a long wrapped package. Just from the weight he understood. It was the Magic Weapon: Water Vortex Spear.</p><br/><p>Tears falling from Gabil\u2019s eyes, he wanted to say something to his father.</p><br/><p>But words wouldn\u2019t come out. He was an exile.</p><br/><p>Filled with various emotions, he could only bow in gratitude.</p><br/><p>And, without looking back, he continued onward.</p><br/><p>To the city under construction he had once visited.</p><br/><p>After walking a bit,</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease wait a minute. Gabil-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>Someone called out to him.</p><br/><p>His 100 subordinates.</p><br/><p>\u300cWha-what are you doing, idiots! I was exiled!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt doesn\u2019t matter to us! We follow Gabil-sama, if you are exiled, then so are we!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cYeah!!!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>They responded with a smile.</p><br/><p>What fools they are;</p><br/><p>This is no place to shed tears. Like my father, I must learn to act with dignity. , he thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat will I do with you! Got it. Follow me!\u300d</p><br/><p>And thus he walked.</p><br/><p>Filled with a different kind of self-confidence than before.</p><br/><p>Gabil\u2019s group joined up with Rimuru a month later.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

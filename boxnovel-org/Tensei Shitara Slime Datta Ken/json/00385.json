But, what about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman shouted as he unleashed a card he had up his sleeve.</p><br/><p>Both of his arms were crossed and thrust forward as it fired\u2014it was a neutral particle cannon.</p><br/><p>It was usually a weapon used while wearing Powered Armor, but Karman was still able to use it in his current state.</p><br/><p>As there was not enough power, it would not pack as large a punch as normal, but its speed was still 80% of the speed of light. That was better than the blaster, which wasn\u2019t even double the speed of sound. And it was more than enough to be effective on cyborg soldiers.</p><br/><p>The speed was accelerated through both arms, the different particles mixed and transformed into an attack\u2026that was not deadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo slow!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a roar, and then Karman was blown away as something slammed into him.</p><br/><p>The particles dispersed and Karman\u2019s special attack was no more.</p><br/><p>Jegyll glared at the fallen man.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me give you a little lecture before I kill you. Whether it is a beam weapon or something else, these deadly blows should be dealt once you are sure that your opponent can no longer move. For instance, after they have just used a special attack. I mean, do you even have enough energy left to raise a barrier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll lifted her hand towards Karman and laughed.</p><br/><p>It was over. Karman knew that he was about to die.</p><br/><p>He realized it after she said it, but Jegyll really hadn\u2019t used plasma during the fight.</p><br/><p>As always, Karman had used it to distract her.</p><br/><p>(I see. When fighting on this level, wasting bullets is a bad idea\u2026)</p><br/><p>It was too late now. Karman would not be able to move for the next two seconds. And that was more than enough time for Jegyll to finish him off.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye, Karman.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a flash.</p><br/><p>Karman was enveloped in light\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll jumped away frantically.</p><br/><p>The ground was burning. Powerful acid was raining down.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t acid. It was the Super Beast\u2019s blood, which contained powerful toxins.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The monster that Karman had saved was now protecting him.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>The serpent\u2019s eyes lit up with the will of a noble human, and then its mouth opened in order to say something to Karman.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026G-ggkaaarmaan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman heard his name come from the mouth of the girl who was now a monster. It had such a nostalgic ring to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs-is it you, Charlotte? Is it you? Are you really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a miracle.</p><br/><p>After one hundred years, Karman had reunited with his lover.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGGgarrman\u2026I\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything below the torso was torn, and purple blood dripped to the ground.</p><br/><p>The rest of the body had exploded and flew everywhere.</p><br/><p>The poison blood had been sprayed towards Jegyll, as if the monster was fulfilling its final role.</p><br/><p>This blood had the ability to melt anything. And so Jegyll could not approach them.</p><br/><p>However, none of that mattered to Karman.</p><br/><p>He had forgotten about Jegyll, no, he had forgotten about the battlefield. All he did now was embrace the twisted and transformed being in front of him.</p><br/><p>The poison burned his arms, but he didn\u2019t mind.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So\u2026you\u2026kept\u2026your\u2026promise\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026so\u2026glad\u2026 Love. You. And\u2026so\u2026live\u2026Karman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, the great serpent forced its mouth to move\u2014and the girl who was now a Super Beast\u2014called Karman\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Charlotte! We finally met. Don\u2019t give up!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026we did. I\u2019m glad\u2026I didn\u2019t give up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Their reunion was short-lived.</p><br/><p>My wish came true\u2014she muttered, and then her hand went limp and fell.</p><br/><p>Her eyes closed silently, covering the snake-like pupils.</p><br/><p>Then the long red hair fell over her forehead like blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu-uuu\u2013uaaahhhhh!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman\u2019s wail echoed.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;\u2026confirmed. Synchronization will begin, as the master ordered&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>\u2014The machine in Karman\u2019s brain said.</p><br/><p>It sounded very cold. Karman was immediately brought back to his senses.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the earth split, and the Powered Armor that should have been broken now appeared.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;As you ordered, all restrictions have been deactivated. \u2018Self Repair\u2019 has now been overwritten by \u2018Ultra Modification Repair\u2019 \u2014 Restoration will now begin. Do you choose to incorporate the material around you? YES/NO&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Material\u2014It was talking about the person Karman was holding.</p><br/><p>Karman closed his eyes and hesitated for a second. And then he bit his lip and decided.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes. We\u2019ll always be together, Charlotte. Let\u2019s get revenge together.\u201d</p><br/><p>He muttered in a voice too quiet for anyone else to hear.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Karman\u2019s will resulted in the birth of a superweapon that exceeded all the laws of physics in this world.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;Permission received. The \u2018brain\u2019 has been saved in the hollow vessel\u2014the \u2018soul\u2019 will now be installed\u2026success\u2014I will now support you as \u2018Charlotte \u2018. I look forward to working with you, Karman!&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Karman\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>But it was only for a moment. He quickly returned to his old self and smiled mischievously.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like him to cry.</p><br/><p>And more importantly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAye, Charlotte. We\u2019ll always be together now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The modification restoration was complete.</p><br/><p>\u2014The two were now united.</p><br/><p>The cloud of blood in the air had now disappeared.</p><br/><p>What was there now, was not a military machine, but a purple machine in the shape of a dragon.</p><br/><p>Jegyll took one look at it and stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What? What does this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There were wings on its back and a tail grew from its flanks.</p><br/><p>Dragonic Armor\u2014it was a destroyer that took features from the Super Beast serpent.</p><br/><p>As for its abilities\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this, Jegyll. I\u2019ll kill you. And then I\u2019ll crush the whole Empire. And then, we shall build a new country!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou make me laugh! You can dream all you want once you are dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014And then, the two clashed once again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Good work, please continue to monitor them.\u300d</p><br/><p>Clayman said this happily, seemingly having come up with something.</p><br/><p>But this has nothing to do with Myulan.</p><br/><p>As the garrison\u2019s Shaman, she is serving as an officer.</p><br/><p>(Stupid humans. I\u2019m a devil, and yet they don\u2019t suspect a thing.)</p><br/><p>Although she looked down on them, talking to them for some time stirred up strange emotions in her heart.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019ll let it be for the time being.I wish to enjoy these moments for a little longer.)</p><br/><p>She made such a wish subconsciously.</p><br/><p>Thus, she went back to work without being too concerned.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>The Demon Grucius, now a member of the frontier garrison, followed his platoon as they advanced into the forest.</p><br/><p>For a beastman such as he, horse-riding was mere child\u2019s play.</p><br/><p>As such, he naturally stood out in the team.</p><br/><p>Even when he held back his true abilities, he couldn\u2019t possibly be inferior to humans.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he was offered the role of vice captain for one of the three platoons.</p><br/><p>However, he refused stating that a newcomer should not hold such a position even after the platoon commander insisted.</p><br/><p>Even though he drew some attention to himself, as long as he maintained his current situation, everything will be fine. That\u2019s what he believed.</p><br/><p>However, what he is currently interested in is the group of goblin wolf riders that followed them.</p><br/><p>The strangely evolved Star wolves and their riders the hobgoblins.</p><br/><p>As if they were a skilled team, even their breathing is synchronized. This suggests a high level of proficiency .</p><br/><p>Above all, The one known as Gobuta was the best amongst the hobgoblins.</p><br/><p>Based on his intuition, the best course of action is to kill him on sight.</p><br/><p>Grucius curled his tongue.</p><br/><p>Originally, he was only planning to invite the Oni, but in this situation it\u2019s very likely there are many other talented individuals.</p><br/><p>There are a total of 100 Goblin wolf riders, and every one of them have talents I want by all means.</p><br/><p>Amongst them are captain Rigur and vice captain Gobuta.</p><br/><p>These two have an overwhelming presence over the others.</p><br/><p>There are also others, like the Dragonewts I see time to time. They will also become good warriors with some training.</p><br/><p>The Orc Pioneers, they aren\u2019t much on their own, but truly shine when together in a group.</p><br/><p>I heard they were led by an orc lord called Gerudo, but I haven\u2019t seen him around the city.</p><br/><p>I heard he\u2019s always out transporting goods, but he\u2019s most likely a powerful individual.</p><br/><p>(What do you know, I\u2019ll be darned! This city is crazy! If I make a move, all this war potential will be ours!)</p><br/><p>In fact, when I look a closer look at the Oni, they\u2019re either my equal or even above me.</p><br/><p>Even though he is the weakest amongst the servants of the Beast King, this is still clearly something abnormal.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s fine isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s more fun this way!</p><br/><p>Having strong comrades is something good. Even if we failed, having powerful enemies is also desirable! That much is true.</p><br/><p>We, the Beastmen, are a race that thrives in battle. Strong enemies are something that we welcomed.</p><br/><p>Thus, while pondering about how he should invite them, he continued with his Frontier Garrison duties.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>YAHHOO \u2014\u2014- Nice!</p><br/><p>I am very satisfied with the feeling of spaciousness after such a long time.</p><br/><p>When I was in the city, I had to pay attention to what I say, my mind feels like it\u2019s about to burst.</p><br/><p>Thus, I left all the problems in the city to the two Oni.</p><br/><p>But, Benimaru said this himself:</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease leave everything regarding the city with us two Oni, we\u2019ll be able to accomplish anything!\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what he said. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll manage somehow.</p><br/><p>Ranga has been on guard the whole time, but no signs of movements were spotted. Now it\u2019s Souei\u2019s turn to take over guard duty._</p><br/><p>He who doesn\u2019t sleep, Souei.</p><br/><p>By creating clones, he can get some sleep in shifts. Even though it\u2019s certainly a useful ability, I don\u2019t want to tell him that he must sleep.</p><br/><p>From the looks of things, no one\u2019s showing their true colors.</p><br/><p>To me, even though they don\u2019t seem to be related to Milim, they may be acquaintances.</p><br/><p>Because this cannot be handled carelessly, we must monitor them carefully.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they don\u2019t seem to have made a move at all.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, then all we can do is to continue to be vigilant. Since I can immediately return to the city with \u300eShadow Step\u300f, I decided to leave the city for a little while.</p><br/><p>Or rather, I speculate that as soon as I\u2019m gone, they\u2019re going to start making their move. Milim has also just left, so they must make their move now.</p><br/><p>I was on alert whilst thinking about this, but after first day I went out of town nothing happened whatsoever.</p><br/><p>After 3 days had passed, I\u2019m starting to think that I may be overly worked up about things.</p><br/><p>They also seem to be fairly strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>And because he said that I entrusted him to lead the way.</p><br/><p>After hearing that, I am now enjoying the spacious feeling after such a long time.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m taking this route because roads haven\u2019t been developed yet.</p><br/><p>After getting off the streets, I followed the animal trail.</p><br/><p>Is this really all right?</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s not enough, we advanced through a variety of different routes. However, there\u2019s a veteran here, so I left it to him.</p><br/><p>Even though he has a tearful face, lets believe in him.</p><br/><p>Besides, it\u2019s not like this is the first time he has come by here.</p><br/><p>One moment later,</p><br/><p>\u300cOi oi, we\u2019re not actually lost are we?\u300d</p><br/><p>I said that as a joke.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha. There\u2019s no way we would have gotten lost here\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>His wording has became strange, everything is fine right?</p><br/><p>Referring to the map in my mind, it seems we walked by here just now. I must be imagining things.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi! This is no joke. You\u2019re lost, aren\u2019t you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The 3 looked at each other,</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cWE\u2019RE VERY SORRY!!!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>And they apologized.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it seems that they have gotten lost trying to take a shortcut. Are these guys really professionals?</p><br/><p>Well whatever.</p><br/><p>I guided them back onto the road, the one they are familiar with.</p><br/><p>We passed by a field of Illusion Flowers in full bloom, that might be the cause of us getting lost. I didn\u2019t tell them though.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow could we have gotten lost in such a place\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI may have lost a little self-confidence\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m overwhelmed, If you professionals paid more respect to the road and followed it then maybe we would not have been lost.\u300d</p><br/><p>They looked a little pitiful, so I told them about the Illusion flowers.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a B rank harvesting mission objective!, It\u2019s pretty difficult ya know!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ellen proclaimed enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>In addition to being material for magic items, it\u2019s also quite a rare flower.</p><br/><p>After a lot of trouble, we returned to pick some. We managed to pick 40, and divided it up to 10 per person. Perhaps, I can understand its uses by storing it in my stomach to analyze.</p><br/><p>About a week\u2019s worth of time has passed, and we finally arrived at the exit of the forest.</p><br/><p>Certainly, but I wonder how much less time would be wasted if I took out the number of days we spent being lost.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s no need for me to rush for this journey. Rather, long trips are much more fun.</p><br/><p>Well, a slime\u2019s body can\u2019t get tired anyway, but I\u2019ll need to remain clean, so I asked Ellen to use\u3008Cleaning Magic\u3009.</p><br/><p>Because Ellen used\u3008Cleaning Magic\u3009, I learned it.</p><br/><p>When I tried using it, my magic amplified the effects of the spell, cleaning everyone in the process. Thanks to that, the journey was more pleasant than usual.</p><br/><p>Starting a fire was easy, and I stayed up all night as the night-watch.</p><br/><p>\u300cRIMURU SAN! LET\u2019S ADVENTURE TOGETHER FOREVER!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ellen exclaimed this emotionally, but as usual, I declined.</p><br/><p>If this was before I met anyone, that would have been a good idea, but I\u2019m the head of a city now. I can leave the governing to the others, but I can\u2019t leave it uncared for.</p><br/><p>Anyways, if someday my presence isn\u2019t needed anymore , I\u2019ll think about the offer then.</p><br/><p>A thought suddenly crossed my mind-Even if I accepted, this will depend on whether or not she\u2019s still alive by that time.</p><br/><p>I wonder is this how Milim feels? To make an important friend, only to out live them, would I choose loneliness instead?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>The current me doesn\u2019t have enough experience to determine that.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>I shook my sadness away, and we went towards the roads.</p><br/><p>Our destination is the small country of Brumund. This particular country is so small that all the nobles are feudal lords of villages. It\u2019s really just a country which comprises of its royal capital.</p><br/><p>I was being led by the trio to the city which housed Brumund\u2019s Freedom Association Branch.</p><br/><p>However, the capital is the only large city and in the castle town lies the Brumund\u2019s Freedom Association Branch.</p><br/><p>We have arrived in the first village earlier than expected, and the carriage left as scheduled.</p><br/><p>We arrived at noon, and ate lunch at a restaurant.</p><br/><p>Seems like the traffic is not congested as it is a small country, which is always nice.</p><br/><p>\u300cHear me, I am the Mighty Axe, WAARGH~ and with a single swing, I killed this fellow!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWow~ As expected of Biddo san!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBig Brother Biddo, this is a strong monster isn\u2019t it? You mean you killed it by yourself?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMore or less, a single horned bear is no match for me!\u300d</p><br/><p>When we heard the conversation, we took a peek at the horned bear they were talking about.</p><br/><p>The main subject of the story, the horned bear, made me almost spit out all the food in my mouth when I saw it.</p><br/><p>It was only the horn of a horned rabbit embedded into the forehead of the bear, laid on the floor as if it was a monster\u2019s corpse.</p><br/><p>The bear is not a monster but rather, is classified as an animal, but it\u2019s hard to tell the difference.</p><br/><p>Fortunately I have my analyze ability, without it, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell the difference.</p><br/><p>A clear way to tell the difference is whether a \u201cmagic stone\u201d drops or not. Even so, for an ordinary person that\u2019s simply just cruel because it\u2019s so rare.</p><br/><p>Even if it didn\u2019t drop a \u201cmagic stone\u201d due to it being an animal, who knows how many of them animals would have been killed before people realize that they are animals, not monsters.</p><br/><p>Well, even though demonic energy seeps from monsters, it\u2019ll still be rather difficult to judge. In the end, due to the high level of my skill , I am able came up with this conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, the guys in that corner are all proud about that fake horned bear, aren\u2019t they just like ants?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? A fake? You saw through the trick?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course! It\u2019s the horn of a horned rabbit, welded on with magic\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected, you saw through it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, Danna. That person\u2019s purpose is not to flaunt. If they took this over to the king, they may become this village\u2019s hero! They\u2019re doing this not to protect the village, but rather to fill their bellies and live in fancy inns.\u300d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>I understand the guild members\u2019 explanation. In short, they\u2019re scammers. The world has so many different kinds of scammers that It has become a profession.</p><br/><p>I was planning to leave after exposing them,</p><br/><p>\u300cOi oi, wait a moment! You just accused me of being a fake! Making a fool out of me, I hope you\u2019re prepared for the consequences?\u300d</p><br/><p>I wonder, why do all the dumb ones have such good hearing. Furthermore, they even decided to pick a fight when I still idling\u2026</p><br/><p>You people even believed in such a fraud\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh, isn\u2019t that Cabal-san\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEllen-san\u2019s also here!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t that person over there Gido!\u300d</p><br/><p>After hearing these words, people flooded the dining room immediately</p><br/><p>\u300cWha, what\u2019s this\u2026\u2026you three are terrible, you should have given me a shout out if you came back!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWho are you, have we met before?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh come on, I may look all rundown and tattered now, but it\u2019s me biddo! I was receiving guidance from you in the capital after picking a fight, it\u2019s me biddo!\u300d</p><br/><p>Well that was unexpected.</p><br/><p>This group of 3 (idiots), are unexpectedly famous.</p><br/><p>They seem acquainted with the fraud to a certain degree, but the other people seem to respect the three.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s rather strange that they don\u2019t seem all that happy even though they\u2019re being respected.</p><br/><p>But, the biggest surprise to me was the fact these 3 are actually famous adventurers.</p><br/><p>They are mainly famous for their sudden rise in prominence recently.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Even so, it\u2019s because they have brought along monsters from my town with them during missions, that\u2019s why they were able to perform so significantly well\u2026</p><br/><p>I looked at the 3, and they looked away in a panic.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll not press them on this matter.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s probably something they don\u2019t want to mention to the people here.</p><br/><p>Even so, even if I don\u2019t touch the matter, it\u2019s still there.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you get it now?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cOF COURSE!!! WE\u2019LL GUIDE YOU TO THE CAPITAL! EVERY STEP OF THE WAY!!!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Then it\u2019s all good.</p><br/><p>The trip ended smoothly even after such a thing happened.</p><br/><p>Thus, we arrived at the royal capital of the small country of Burmund.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

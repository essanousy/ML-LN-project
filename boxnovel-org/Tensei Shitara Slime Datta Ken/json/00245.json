After all, Veldora-san was the only one who suffered any damage from that big explosion.</p><br/><p>Everyone else seemed to be unharmed, what a relief.</p><br/><p>Oh well, if it\u2019s Veldora-san, I felt a mysterious reassurance that he would turn out okay even if he was seriously injured.</p><br/><p>Since his real body was inside me, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you doing? Didn\u2019t you boast that you would be fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGrrr, that\u2019s my line! Why did the \u201cCorridor\u201d suddenly closed even though I tried to suppress the explosion with force!?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I asked him mixed with a sigh, Veldora angrily asked back at me.</p><br/><p>Corridor\u2026\u2026 did he mean the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d?</p><br/><p>\u300aFufuu. It\u2019s because Veldora had been the one most wasteful with Master\u2019s magic essences. I wanted to teach him a lesson, so I calculated that it will go out of control, but that it would only damage him and closed the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d at the perfect moment.\u300b</p><br/><p>You did what!?</p><br/><p>Rather, Ciel-san appeared to be angry for some reason.</p><br/><p>Although she had said that Veldora could use it as much as he liked in the previous conversation, what\u2019s with this sudden change of attitude here\u2026...</p><br/><p>\u300aIn the first place, I\u2019ve been suppressing the usage so that the energy won\u2019t be used inefficiently. As for this, Veldora is\u2015\u2015\u300b</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen I saw you absorbing the energy, I thought I wanted to copy it too! Even though it was just a bit more and I would have completed it and powered-up myself too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, no, I think that\u2019s impossible\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I guess this is what people would call flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>I never said to him not to copy someone else, but I wished in such a tense situation we had here, he wouldn\u2019t try something that he couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>First of all, how can Veldora power-up himself if he didn\u2019t have the ability to convert energy\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>It was a simple task, all he had to do was to suppress and offset it normally; It\u2019s amazing that he could deliberately mess up.</p><br/><p>Veldora-san probably tried to blend it with a large amount of energy he tried to draw out from me while suppressing it with his own full power.</p><br/><p>Did he assume that by doing that he could forcibly take in the altered energy?</p><br/><p>\u300aNot just that, he tried to pour the energy through the \u201cSoul Corridor\u201d when he couldn\u2019t get used to it smoothly. Rather than a power-up, he probably planned a recycling.\u300b</p><br/><p>I see\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Certainly, Ciel-san could deal with it easily, but it would be risky if sending weird things became a habit.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s right by refusing as she seemed to be conveniently used as someone who took care of things when he was in trouble.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t deal with it himself, he pushed it to Ciel-san and took the energy as he pleased.</p><br/><p>Even Ciel-san would flip out over that.</p><br/><p>Though she meant to rake him over the coals, she probably wanted to punish Veldora.</p><br/><p>As expected, not even Veldora could deal with it since Ciel-san had done it when he was unprepared for something like that.</p><br/><p>Oh well, Ciel-san probably determined the moment when he couldn\u2019t handle it though.</p><br/><p>I was surprised that such foolish exchanges were happening without my knowledge.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo matter how I look at it isn\u2019t that your own fault!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGrrr\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s not fair that only Rimuru can use such a convenient ability\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t go \u201cGrrr\u201d at me. Are you a kid!</p><br/><p>Oh, well, whatever, his foolishness was quite painful for everyone to see.</p><br/><p>\u300cVeldora, you\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>See?</p><br/><p>Even Velgrind, who put the sword over her shoulder, is now glaring this way with half-opened eyes, you know?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s very scary that Velzard is smiling but her eyes aren\u2019t.</p><br/><p>I told that to Veldora through eye contact.</p><br/><p>OH NO! So Veldora, whose face turned miserable, seemingly wanted to say.</p><br/><p>It seemed he realized that he was getting a bit too full of himself and he looked back and forth between me and his two sisters in panic.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, practice is the key. Even you will be able to use it if you keep doing your best, so be diligent. Therefore, help me to defeat Velda first.\u300d</p><br/><p>I decided to give Veldora a helping hand.</p><br/><p>My reason was it would be a bother if he ended up sulking, but Veldora-san who was shivering before his two older sisters looked pitiful if I didn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>I acted like this time he just messed up a bit and everything was going as planned from the start.</p><br/><p>\u300cHa\u2026hahaha. I guess so. It seems I have been a bit too overconfident. One has to learn humbleness or something like that, right. Alright, then I\u2019ll return inside and lend you my strength!\u300d</p><br/><p>Until the end, Veldora was still glossing over his coolness and returned back inside me as if he was running away.</p><br/><p>He owed me one for this.</p><br/><p>Since it was a good chance, I decided to make Veldora-san reside inside my katana.</p><br/><p>I got Veldora\u2019s agreement and put Veldora who underwent\u300eTrue Dragon Core Transformation\u300finto the katana.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t feel like being stingy in this seemingly final decisive battle.</p><br/><p>I thought that it was great that I could retrieve Veldora back smoothly since Velda would be very cautious if he were to see Veldora transforming in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Since I pretended that I retrieved him back because he was hurt, Velda wouldn\u2019t notice the change in my katana.</p><br/><p>Veldora-san\u2019s mischievous conducts were surprising, but it might result in something good.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Well, with this, my preparation was complete and I only had to defeat Velda now.</p><br/><p>I could ignore the effects on my surroundings since this is in the sky.</p><br/><p>If I used my full power on the surface, it would become a serious problem due to environmental destruction.</p><br/><p>I did cut apart the ocean before; the follow up afterward was very hard.</p><br/><p>It seemed that when Guy and Milim fought each other long ago, they ended creating a barren desert.</p><br/><p>With that said, the heaven could be said as a perfect place.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, need help?\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy asked.</p><br/><p>I was happy with the offer, but I would be fine alone.</p><br/><p>Because I planned to swing Veldora Sword, it would be a big problem if anyone got involved.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, me alone is enough. However, since I\u2019m planning to unleash a bit of my full power so it would be quite helpful if you help Ramiris with the barrier. I don\u2019t want Velda to ran away from this place and just want things absolutely ensured.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? You\u2019re quite confident. Okay, leave that to me.\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy nodded and began to help Ramiris in reinforcing the\u300eDifferent World Barrier[1]\u300fthat covered up the heaven.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m counting on you, Rimuru!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim looked at me with eyes full of anticipation and following after Guy, she started to pour her power into Gaia in her embrace</p><br/><p>It seemed that she was helping with the barrier\u2019s reinforcement.</p><br/><p>\u300cMay fortune smiles in your favor, Rimuru-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>Diablo encouraged me while he was tending to Testarossa and the other two.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s finish this quickly and rebuild our country.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf by any chance I got defeated\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSurely you jest. It\u2019s impossible for Rimuru-sama to lose.\u300d</p><br/><p>Diablo declared so with a tremendous faith.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have any intention to lose, but my victory wasn\u2019t guaranteed either\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Diablo didn\u2019t seem to think that I could lose at all.</p><br/><p>\u300cSensei\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll finish everything. It seems I can finally save you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2026\u2026 Sensei\u2026\u2026 If Sensei looks about to lose\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s impossible for me to lose, you know? Whether that\u2019s true or not, I\u2019ll prove it right away.\u300d</p><br/><p>I cheerfully quoted Diablo\u2019s words and Chloe finally smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. I'll be waiting for it.\u300d</p><br/><p>I could feel the strength behind her words that she would be waiting for me as her tense expression seemed to soften a bit.</p><br/><p>I was worried about Chloe who was kind of unstable, but she would be fine now.</p><br/><p>Guy, Milim, Ramiris, Chloe, Diablo and Testarossa and the others.</p><br/><p>Velzard and Velgrind, the True Dragon sisters and Velgaia who was maintaining the\u300eDifferent World Barrier\u300f.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes were concentrated on my back and I raised one hand to answer it.</p><br/><p>I maintained my gaze to Velda.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry to keep you waiting. Well, let\u2019s get started.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026 Shut up. Don\u2019t get full of yourself just because you won over these mobs. It\u2019ll be easy for me to massacre all of you if I get serious.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh is that so. I think it\u2019s impossible, but try it if you can.\u300d</p><br/><p>My and Velda\u2019s sights intersected simultaneously with my katana and his sword.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a clear sound echoed in the place as a severed tip of a blade flew into the air and stuck on the ground.</p><br/><p>Velda\u2019s face was dyed with shock.</p><br/><p>Naturally, it was because I slashed Velda\u2019s sword with my katana. Moreover, the shockwaves caused by my surging slash blew away half of the remaining castle.</p><br/><p>The delayed echoes were the sounds of the destroyed castle crumbling.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s deliver the final blow on Velda with the sounds as his requiem.</p><br/><p>Velda had created a new sword without panicking.</p><br/><p>It was impressive that he immediately regained his calm, but it had been proven before that his sword was no match against Veldora Sword.</p><br/><p>I swung the katana again and slashed Velda\u2019s sword off.</p><br/><p>I thought it was amazing that he could create many God Class swords, but even I could do something similar. It wasn\u2019t an ability that needed to be fussed over so much.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be\u2026.. Although mine is ranked the lowest, it\u2019s definitely a God Class sword\u2015\u2015No, what is with his sword? Impossible\u2026\u2026 Could it be a Genesis Class[2]!?\u300d</p><br/><p>He seemed to finally have noticed it.</p><br/><p>About my katana, Veldora Sword.</p><br/><p>It was my first time hearing Genesis Class or something like that, but I didn\u2019t really care about such a thing.</p><br/><p>Its silvery blade is dyed with aura thinly cladding it and emitting jet black radiance. On its blade, the golden blade pattern undulating beautifully, giving off a very fantastic beauty.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s really a shame to call a sword with an unserious name as Veldora Sword.</p><br/><p>Oh well, Veldora-san\u2019s real form is also jet black-colored and he looks magnificent and beautiful if he shuts his mouth though.</p><br/><p>(Hey, did you think of something really rude just now?)</p><br/><p>Nope, everything is fine.</p><br/><p>I felt like I heard some kind of dissatisfied voice, but let\u2019s not worry about it.</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know what class this sword is. It has nothing to do with defeating you! Come now, let\u2019s end our warm-ups and quickly show me what you can really do. I have plenty of time, but they are not for playing with you!\u300d</p><br/><p>I declared at Velda as I wanted to finish this soon.</p><br/><p>There was no point to keep playing with him. I thought about becoming serious soon.</p><br/><p>However, I perceived something was wrong with Velda.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Kuh, what I can really do, you said? Don\u2019t you dare underestimate me, for I\u2019m the true successor of Veldanava!!\u300d</p><br/><p>With an expression distorted by anger and humiliation, Velda brought his hands together.</p><br/><p>Then, he shouted\u300cDivine Sword Summon\u300dand a sword harboring ominous power was summoned.</p><br/><p>Unlike his previous creations, it was a mysterious sword that clearly was of a higher rank.</p><br/><p>\u300cI shall give you my praise for making me take out this sword, my last resort. This Genesis: Veldanava Sword[3]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>It was a beautiful sword.</p><br/><p>A large long sword with a slightly inward curved blade.</p><br/><p>The blade shined with blue glow as if the blade itself emitted the light.</p><br/><p>Contrary to its appearance, its mass might be comparable to a planet. It was a cluster of super-high-dense energy.</p><br/><p>It seemed to be a Genesis Class thingy he mentioned earlier, so we became equal in terms of weapon or something like that?</p><br/><p>As I expected, it was unlikely for me to win easily, but this was within my expectations.</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru, it was beyond my expectation that you possess a sword comparable to this one and only Genesis Class, you know. However, since I\u2019ve pulled out this sword, it\u2019s over for you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda declared with his restored confidence.</p><br/><p>Then, he swung down the sword toward me.</p><br/><p>His movement was exactly what you would call as Godspeed, it might be impossible to react to it if it was not me.</p><br/><p>However\u2015\u2015 From my point of view, Velda\u2019s movement was really crude.</p><br/><p>Although I said that the warm up was over, is he still testing me?</p><br/><p>Or perhaps he underestimated me this late in the game because I was lower ranked than him\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t mind either way though. Since I would just do what I had to do.</p><br/><p>\u300cToo slow.\u300d</p><br/><p>I muttered a few words and swung my katana.</p><br/><p>Velda hurriedly changed the trajectory of his sword and stopped my katana. However, he was unable to bear with the overwhelming shock wave that occurred when our blades clashed and he was blown away while breaking several piles of rubble as he rolled over the ground.</p><br/><p>However, that was strange.</p><br/><p>It was certainly a terrifying shock wave, but I only felt it was like a breeze.</p><br/><p>Was this guy perhaps\u2026..</p><br/><p>Could it be that was his full power?</p><br/><p>I thought there was no way that was true and denied that thought.</p><br/><p>When I met Velda in the Imperial Capital, I felt a very threatening presence from him.</p><br/><p>If we fought that time, I thought that it was very probable for me to lose.</p><br/><p>And yet, I didn\u2019t feel the same threat from him now\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300aOf course. Master is evolving every day after all.\u300b</p><br/><p>To answer my question, Ciel-san declared so as if what she said was natural.</p><br/><p>Hey, hey, didn\u2019t you say that super-strengthening or something like that was not possible? And yet, why did I feel like I\u2019m getting super strong!?</p><br/><p>\u300aMaster is an exception. Plus, there\u2019s an exception even for everything else.\u300b</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that a double standard!</p><br/><p>For Ciel-san to conclude her explanation with a double standard, how formidable she had become.</p><br/><p>\u300cDamn it, if only\u300eRaphael\u300f, if only I got my hands on\u300eRaphael\u300f, I could become the ultimate form!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda began shouting something he regretted</p><br/><p>Raphael? Did he mean the Ultimate Skill that I had?</p><br/><p>Ciel-san had said it was unnecessary and erased it after the synthesis, but was it really such an important Skill?</p><br/><p>\u300cI had that Skill before, but it\u2019s already gone now, you know? Unfortunately, but there was no possibility for your wish to come true.\u300d</p><br/><p>With the intention to break his heart and a bit of compassion, I cruelly informed Velda.</p><br/><p>Our fight\u2019s outcome would be decided by the one whose heart broke first.</p><br/><p>Therefore, what I said would become a decisive blow against Velda.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt, it can\u2019t be!?\u300eRaphael\u300fis gone\u2015\u2015? Then, I can\u2019t prove that I\u2019m Veldanava\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda muttered unclear words with his hollow expression.</p><br/><p>\u300aHow foolish. Even if he supposedly was able to manifest your Skill, it will be impossible for an imposter to be acknowledged as Veldanava.\u300b</p><br/><p>Ciel sent her thoughts as if to deal the final blow on Velda.</p><br/><p>Could you send your thought to everyone like that? Or rather, what did you mean with acknowledging Veldanava or something like that?</p><br/><p>\u300aI just said what was appropriate, please don\u2019t mind it.\u300b</p><br/><p>Ehh, is that true?</p><br/><p>Ciel-san said that she said that to break Velda\u2019s heart but\u2026\u2026 She didn\u2019t hide something, right?</p><br/><p>Without my knowing, it seemed the means of communication had increased, Ciel-san was really full of mysteries.</p><br/><p>\u300aIt\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no problem.\u300b</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019s not that\u2026\u2026 oh well, whatever.</p><br/><p>She might be not lying, but I didn\u2019t think she said the truth either.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be, I am\u2015\u2015 I am Veldanava\u2026\u2026 I won\u2019t accept this\u2026\u2026 If only I have\u300eRaphael\u300f, the real Lucia will acknowledge me!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda shouted as if he went mad and attacked me without care of anything, but his weak attacks wouldn\u2019t work on me.</p><br/><p>I easily repelled his sword and blew Velda away for the second time.</p><br/><p>I guess it was not a fight anymore.</p><br/><p>His heart was broken too, what was left for me was to deal the final blow.</p><br/><p>When I thought so\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s Rimuru\u2019s victory.\u300d</p><br/><p>I heard Guy said that.</p><br/><p>Hey, if you say something like that\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWai, Guy! When you say something like that, if I remember correctly\u2015\u2015 you will set off a \u201cflag\u201d, saying something like that is quite famous in the industry, you know!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right! I also studied Rimuru\u2019s manga. It\u2019s taboo to say something like that, you know!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris and Milim came to stop Guy faster than I was.</p><br/><p>However, not just Guy, the True Dragon sisters also joined the fray.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you guys trying to say. No matter how you look at it, isn\u2019t this Rimuru\u2019s complete victory?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s true, Velda has tremendous power for a fake, but as I expected he\u2019s not comparable with the real Aniue. He doesn\u2019t seem to be a match for that absurd slime.\u300d</p><br/><p>The two of them eagerly said those words as if the crisis had passed.</p><br/><p>\u300cLike I said, it\u2019ll be a lead up before the enemy gets stronger, so stop with statements like that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! They called this \u201cclich\u00e9\u201d, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim shouted and Ramiris agreed to her.</p><br/><p>However, they were already too late\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu, ahahahahaha!\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda stood up while laughing.</p><br/><p>Have he lost it? No, rather than that, his expression is\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cI knew it. It was as I had expected, Rimuru-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>With a smile I knew very well, he called me with his clear voice.</p><br/><p>This sensation, this guy is without a doubt\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that you, Yuuki?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, long time no see. As I expected, Velda couldn\u2019t win against you. However, it\u2019s not a problem. He had earned me plenty of time. Well, shall we start\u2015\u2015 the final battle between you and me.\u300d</p><br/><p>While still smiling, Yuuki said so and pointed Genesis: Veldanava Sword at me.</p><br/><p>[1]  Ikai Kekkai.

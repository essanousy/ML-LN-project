If they had swiftly dealt with the situation, there wouldn\u2019t be any demon army being summoned; only then would it be proper to think about the battle with Guy.</p><br/><p>The present situation was grim.</p><br/><p>There were individuals among the summoned demons that even Velgrynd would have problems dealing with.</p><br/><p>It was imperative to finish this as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>Alongside Veldora, she would finish off the Demon Lord before them.</p><br/><p>With this decision, Velgrynd swiftly took action.</p><br/><p>Velgrynd\u2019s style was to abide by her intuition, instead of thinking too much.</p><br/><p>\u300cRudra, get Veldora out to battle at full power! It\u2019ll be dangerous if we don\u2019t eliminate her quick!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm. Though I don\u2019t see much to be wary of\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Alright then. Since you are saying that much, let us start off with the leader of these demons. Regalia Dominion!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Velgrynd asked Rudra for Veldora\u2019s assistance in an exchange via Telepathy.</p><br/><p>Rudra still didn\u2019t lose any composure, and happily accepted the request to make use of Veldora.</p><br/><p>Velgrynd felt slightly anxious at how unconcerned Rudra was. But there didn\u2019t seem like there was much of a chance of victory for the Demon Lord, seeing as she had chosen to take on both Veldora and herself.</p><br/><p>They were the strongest beings, the \u201cTrue Dragons\u201d, after all.</p><br/><p>With a roar, Veldora began to take action.</p><br/><p>Velgrynd also roared in an effort of cast off her own uneasiness, and began the assault to destroy the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Veldora made the first move, against Rimuru who declared he was going to take on two \u201cTrue Dragons\u201d at the same time.</p><br/><p>The first attack against Rimuru was a full power Storm Blast.</p><br/><p>\u300aAlert. Incoming Storm Blast.</p><br/><p>Deploying \u300eCovenant King Uriel\u2019s\u300f Barrier\u2015\u2015 \u300b</p><br/><p>(Dodge that you idiot!!!)</p><br/><p>Rimuru canceled Wisdom Lord Raphael\u2019s optimum choice, and took evasive action forcefully.</p><br/><p>Shortly after, the defense field that was set up was pierced, and the destructive force from the Storm Blast spread out at that point.</p><br/><p>It would have been a direct hit if evasive actions were a moment slower.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Calculation miss? Unexpected situation? Unable to compute\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300aError. Calculations showed it was 100% probability\u2015\u2015 \u300b</p><br/><p>(Now isn\u2019t the time to space out! Veldora has Faust\u2019s probability manipulation.</p><br/><p>It has the capability to bypass your perfectly calculated scenarios. Or should I say control the result? Calculation-based actions won\u2019t work against Veldora.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think, feel! Worrying doesn\u2019t suit you!</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll deal with him, so you deal with Velgrynd!)</p><br/><p>\u300a\u2015\u2015 Under-. I understand. \u300b</p><br/><p>(There\u2019s two opponents, but there\u2019s also two of us. I\u2019m counting on you, you know?</p><br/><p>Wall Velgrynd off with \u300eCovenant King Uriel\u300f.</p><br/><p>Do what is necessary to hold on until I can get Veldora back.</p><br/><p>Or just seal the red fella up! I\u2019m depending on you, partner!)</p><br/><p>With those words, a certain feeling fills up Wisdom Lord Raphael\u2019s confused and hollow thought processes.</p><br/><p>Depending on me?</p><br/><p>Even though I was mistaken?</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026. This person, says he needs me, I who am simply processing power.</p><br/><p>It was, happiness.</p><br/><p>It was, blessing.</p><br/><p>It was\u2015\u2015, the birth of emotion.</p><br/><p>Wisdom Lord Raphael was confused at the unprocessable elements which were sprouting out from within.</p><br/><p>But, felt at the same time, a sense of fulfillment\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Ah, I am now, in the midst of eternal bliss\u2015\u2015 (EN: ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0))</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 That, was what she processed.</p><br/><p>There was nothing to fear now.</p><br/><p>Despite the current situation, no danger could be felt.</p><br/><p>As Rimuru commanded, Velgrynd\u2019s Burning Breath was blocked easily with Covenant King Uriel.</p><br/><p>\u300aAs you command, my Master!!\u300b(EN: see those? Those the exclamation marks!!)</p><br/><p>Wisdom Lord Raphael awakened, and with thoughts of answering to Rimuru\u2019s wishes, brought forth ever more precision.</p><br/><p>Velgrynd was annoyed at the fact that her breath attack was blocked like it was nothing.</p><br/><p>As it was an attack on an alert opponent, it was obvious normal attacks weren\u2019t going to be enough.</p><br/><p>The quality of the opponent\u2019s abilities were obviously better despite Velgrynd having more Energy overall.</p><br/><p>The opponent has absolute defenses against heat, this wasn\u2019t amusing at all.</p><br/><p>As a test, she released tens of Heat Blasters in a continuous attack.</p><br/><p>Even such an attack didn\u2019t have any effect, as everything just bounced off the shield that appeared.</p><br/><p>(Tsk! Everything gets blocked, as though perfectly calculated! How annoying.)</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t amusing at all.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Rimuru wasn\u2019t using the shield against Veldora, but was either dodging or repelling the attacks with a similar attack.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, she wasn\u2019t even looking at Velgrynd, as all her attacks are fully guarded against.</p><br/><p>Even if it was possible to be conscious of everything around oneself with \u300eMagic Perception\u300f, Velgrynd was absolutely appalled, as it obviously looked like she was being totally ignored.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019ll make you utterly regret looking down on me!!)</p><br/><p>The prideful Velgrynd, decided to unleash the most powerful attack in her entire arsenal.</p><br/><p>Like an engine starting up, Velgrynd began releasing immense amounts of magic energy.</p><br/><p>Ultimate Skill \u300eCharity King Raguel\u300f, her power of manipulating and accelerating heat.</p><br/><p>If the ability to forcefully increase momentum was used on herself, the fastest being in this world would undoubtedly be herself.</p><br/><p>If so, what if it was used on something other than herself?</p><br/><p>With the body being accelerated non-stop, no matter what kind of living being, the body would be unable to withstand the heat and eventually crumble from thermal decay.</p><br/><p>\u300cDie! This shall be your end, there will be no remains! Cardinal Acceleration!!\u300d</p><br/><p>In addition to her Ultimate Skill, with the essence of heat, her power of acceleration added on.</p><br/><p>Waves of destruction were released towards Rimuru, riding the roar of the crimson dragon.</p><br/><p>This was, Velgrynd\u2019s ultimate attack.</p><br/><p>The undulating waves of this ability, easily outsped any form of evasion, it demonstrated Velgrynd\u2019s pride as the fastest.</p><br/><p>Which meant, evasion was impossible.</p><br/><p>For the Demon Lord who was focused on repelling the attacking Veldora, she was in no position to either defend or evade.</p><br/><p>If she mistook this to be the same as previous attacks, any number of layers of defense fields would be swallowed whole, and she would die with no time for regrets.</p><br/><p>Velgrynd confirmed the effects of her attack with absolute confidence.</p><br/><p>But, she was stupefied as she saw the unharmed Rimuru.</p><br/><p>(What the! That\u2019s not possible!!)</p><br/><p>It was an unavoidable, absolute attack, there shouldn\u2019t have been anyone who was able to survive such an attack with no injuries at all.</p><br/><p>Even if it was Demon Lord Guy\u30fbCrimson or her Elder Sister \u201cFrost Dragon\u201d Velzard.</p><br/><p>Unless it was repelled by some sort of ability or attack, it wasn\u2019t supposed to be an attack that could be stopped by defense field type abilities.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s impossible! That attack was supposed to pierce through force fields and defensive abilities\u2026. You, what did you do!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph. That was definitely dangerous\u2026. But It\u2019s simple to \u201ceat\u201d such an overly impulsive attack, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>(Well, with Wisdom Lord Raphael\u2019s calculations, your attack was baited though.)</p><br/><p>For Rimuru to better focus on Veldora, Wisdom Lord Raphael was given free reign to deal with Velgrynd and was inciting all of her attacks.</p><br/><p>And, for attacks that looked to be unblockable, Rimuru would briefly deal with such attacks.</p><br/><p>Using Gluttony King Belzebuth, the effects of the attack would be consumed. Then, isolated.</p><br/><p>This previous attack was definitely capable of dealing fatal damage to Rimuru, an unblockable attack.</p><br/><p>But, by consuming and isolating it with Gluttony King Belzebuth, there were no problems.</p><br/><p>All that was left is to analyze the energy that had been isolated in the stomach(storage space), and finally neutralize it.</p><br/><p>The isolation space of Gluttony King Belzebuth\u2019s \u300eStomach\u300f, had become a warped space that has even more power than Absolute Defense, was now capable of neutralizing any attack.</p><br/><p>Also, with Wisdom Lord Raphael\u2019s baiting of Velgrynd wasn\u2019t over just yet.</p><br/><p>\u300cEven though you are shocked that nothing happened with your best attack, you do know we are still in the middle of a battle right?\u300d</p><br/><p>By the time she recognized and understood what Rimuru said, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>\u300aAlert. Analysis of attack concluded. Energy measurement, complete.</p><br/><p>Calculations confirm possibility to seal for a limited amount of time. Activating\u300eInsulated Prison\u300f! \u300b</p><br/><p>That, was an ability synthesized using Covenant King Uriel\u2019s Endless Prison fused with an insulated space.</p><br/><p>With the surrounding area under control with Spatial Domination silently spread all around, Velgrynd was unaware she had been lured into a multi-layered magic formation.</p><br/><p>As Wisdom Lord Raphael announced, a shining\u300eInsulated Prison\u300fwas formed instantly.</p><br/><p>Letting the opponent unleash a finishing move, then aiming for the opportunity right after when the opponent had expended their Energy, such was Wisdom Lord Raphael\u2019s perfect strategy.</p><br/><p>\u300cStay there quietly for a while! I\u2019ll play with you after I free Veldora.\u300d</p><br/><p>Said Rimuru as Raphael activated the hidden prison, while he was still dealing with Veldora.</p><br/><p>It was a restraining technique with the opponent\u2019s special traits taken into account, made a reality with the fusion of abilities.</p><br/><p>It would be called Calculation Prison, if it were to be given a name.</p><br/><p>A total victory for Wisdom Lord Raphael.</p><br/><p>Rimuru confirmed that Velgrynd was properly sealed, and gave a satisfied nod to Wisdom Lord Raphael for faithfully completing the objective.</p><br/><p>\u300aAlert.\u300eInsulated Prison\u300factivation confirmed. Target movements sealed, for roughly 3 minutes.\u300b</p><br/><p>(Got it! Now then, to put all our effort into dealing with Veldora. Gimme a hand, Raphael!!)</p><br/><p>\u300aAs you wish!\u300b</p><br/><p>Rimuru, no, the both of them who sealed \u201cScorch Dragon\u201d Velgrynd up for the time being\u2026 now turned their attention to \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d Veldora, their real goal.</p><br/><p>To clinch the victory, within the 3 minutes of time bought by Raphael.</p><br/><p>To use this short yet seemingly infinite amount of time the best he could, Rimuru charged towards Veldora.</p><br/><p>As expected of Wisdom Lord Raphael.</p><br/><p>To perfectly answer my expectations, no, much more than that, within such a short period of time.</p><br/><p>Managing to seal Velgrynd, one of the \u201cTrue Dragons\u201d, for several minutes even.</p><br/><p>Hmph.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t lose to that now.</p><br/><p>Gotta free Veldora quickly, and take down the Emperor.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t let more people be controlled against their own will, like Chloe.</p><br/><p>Then, to swiftly crush the empire, and corner Yuuki.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a whole mountain load of things I had to do, and things that need to done.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t be stumbling now.</p><br/><p>(Sorry for the wait, Veldora. The real deal starts now!)</p><br/><p>Time to finish this quickly.</p><br/><p>During the time Wisdom Lord Raphael was dealing with Velgrynd, Rimuru was finding difficulty in doing anything decisive against Veldora.</p><br/><p>As the Storm series abilities had been left behind, it was possible to repel Veldora\u2019s attacks. But to repel such large scale attacks, it resulted in a similar level of energy consumption.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a direct source of damage, but stamina is definitely being shaved off.</p><br/><p>The energy recovery from\u300eFood Chain\u300fseemed to help a lot, as the evolution of his subordinates had an influence on it.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many attacks from this side that have direct effect.</p><br/><p>Weapon attacks were pointless.</p><br/><p>Storm series abilities were also pointless.</p><br/><p>It was confirmed that Covenant King Uriel wasn\u2019t going to be of much help, so its usage was passed over to Wisdom Lord Raphael.</p><br/><p>Only Gluttony King Belzebuth could be relied on.</p><br/><p>It was the highest point of evolution, from the base Slime ability\u300ePredation\u300f.</p><br/><p>Now that Gluttony King Belzebuth had been mastered, it could be activated from any part of this Demon Slime body.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, even with the entire body.</p><br/><p>It was decided.</p><br/><p>To not just neutralize the Storm attacks with Gluttony King Belzebuth, but to straight up totally devour Veldora.</p><br/><p>\u300cMaking me do all this work, Veldora! Stop causing all this trouble dammit! \u300d</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Kuahahahaha! It\u2019s just a small failure. Forgive me! \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>At the moment of contact with Veldora, I thought I hear a carefree voice.</p><br/><p>(Hey\u2026. You conscious in there?)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Yeah. Actually, I fully seperated my Nucleic Heart, so my ego is completely intact! \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Then hurry up and get your body back!)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015I would if I could. Oh, look out, \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d is coming up! \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>At the moment he heard Veldora say that, the powerful slicing ability of the \u201cDeath Heralding Winds\u201d assaulted Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Frantically evading, Rimuru got Wisdom Lord Raphael to balance out his surroundings.</p><br/><p>(The hell man, that ain\u2019t what you said! What lightning, those were wind blades!?)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Mmm!? Sorry bout that. Looks like I can only tell when a skill is going to be activated but not identify which skill\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Got it\u2026. Stop saying such irresponsible things. Mistakes like that can cause failure.</p><br/><p>It won\u2019t be a laughing matter if I died after trusting you.)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Roger that. I was hoping I could help a little though\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Well, it\u2019s all good enough if you\u2019re fine.)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Kuahahahaha! Of course I\u2019m fine. I *am* the most powerful dragon right!?\u2013</p><br/><p>(Ah, yeah. I\u2019ll get you out in a bit, so wait?)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015No problem. I wasn\u2019t worried at all. For that purpose, I suppressed the worst of it\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(The worst?)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Ah. I took a shot of a \u201ccurse\u201d that destroys magic circuits. So I hurriedly cut the Soul Corridor. As the effect travels through the magic circuits, it would have affected you too\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Huh? So it wasn\u2019t destroyed by the enemy\u2019s ability?)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Yeah. It was a powerful ability, and since I wasn\u2019t going to make it with defense, that was the only way to minimize collateral damage. Because of that, my Resist magic circuits were destroyed and I wasn\u2019t able to resist the \u201cDomination effect\u201d, which resulted in the present situation! \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Stop boasting about that. Geez, just what were you thinking.</p><br/><p>weren\u2019t I telling you not to let your guard down every other day!?)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Kuahahahaha! Who would\u2019ve thought I would get chewed out by you in this situation! \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(Alright that\u2019s enough, what matters is you\u2019re alright. You *are* alright right?)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Technically speaking, I\u2019m fine. While destroying the Soul Corridor, I protected my Heart which served as the core. But because of that, I lost all control over my body, and had no means of recovering that control\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s why.</p><br/><p>But as long as the core is intact, we have options available.</p><br/><p>(Wisdom Lord Raphael, is it possible to recover Ultimate Skill\u300eStorm King Veldora\u300f?)</p><br/><p>\u300aAlert. As long as the Nucleic Heart is intact, re-establishing the Soul Corridor is possible. There are no problems with the recovery of Ultimate Skill\u300eStorm King Veldora\u300f.\u300b</p><br/><p>Alright, problem solved.</p><br/><p>The remaining task would be to defeat Veldora\u2019s \u201cbody\u201d. It\u2019s all good as long as we can recover the core.</p><br/><p>(Sit tight. I\u2019ll free you soon.)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Kuahahahaha! How reliable. You have my faith, Rimuru my friend! \u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Yea, I\u2019m gonna free you real quick.</p><br/><p>The problem had been solved.</p><br/><p>The direction to go about getting Veldora back was confirmed.</p><br/><p>All that was left was to actually do it.</p><br/><p>Alrighty, let\u2019s beat him then.</p><br/><p>One of the strongest, \u201cStorm Dragon\u201d Veldora!!</p><br/><p>(EN: Author\u2019s notes)</p><br/><p>I love seeing everyone\u2019s impressions, so I\u2019m happy to have gotten lots.</p><br/><p>But, replying to all of them doesn\u2019t seem possible.</p><br/><p>But I have been reading all of them, so don\u2019t worry.</p><br/><p>Editor\u2019s Rant:</p><br/><p>Gao!!~ This concludes another batch of chapters. The next batch should be out next week starting Friday if the Lord (Milim-tan) wills it! This was an awesome chapter. I think it\u2019s my favourite chapter to date. Sushi (translator) wanted to address some of the comments in his own rant, but it seemed important so I put it on its own page. See it here . As for myself, like the author, I read all the comments I get. They\u2019re not so much in number that I can\u2019t, so for now, I read em all ~ gao! (well eventually anyway~). Also, you may notice multiple lion progress bars\u2026 you may think \u300eCrazy\u300for \u300eAbsolute Genius\u300f but you can\u2019t get off this ride ~ gahahahao!!! Well. Ahem. See you in another chapter ~gao!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

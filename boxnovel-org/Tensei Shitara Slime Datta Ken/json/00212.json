With such strength, even if you fight fair and square you would be quite good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha, I\u2019ll receive th\u2019 praise, but I think I juist want to enjoys \u2018n\u2019 win.</p><br/><p>Still\u2026\u2026 you\u2019re verry troublesome, Nii-san[1].</p><br/><p>Even though I act because I culd see a certain vision of I killing ye, t\u2019was just an imitation.</p><br/><p>Just like what my intuition says, to withdraw is th\u2019 correct answer.\u300d</p><br/><p>Laplace prepared several knives in his hand while shaking his head in disappointment.</p><br/><p>And, from his mouth comes an enjoying smile.</p><br/><p>Just like his title as Wonder Clown, Laplace is enjoying fighting as something to live for.</p><br/><p>He pursued the presence of the Souei\u2019s main body while killing all of the created mirror images.</p><br/><p>He analyze the magic power wave that Souei releases and might be said that he memorized it.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, how skillful. Carelessly intercepting it is difficult heh.\u300d</p><br/><p>One of the clones exploded at the same time as it repelled Laplace\u2019s knife.</p><br/><p>It seemed to be a bomb which disguised as a knife.</p><br/><p>And in addition to that, it\u2019s spirit bomb. Having all of 7 attributes, it\u2019s an object that contains the Omnipotent attribute to counter the Demonic and the Holy attributes.</p><br/><p>\u300cHehehe. Since Nee-san\u2019s attribute is th\u2019 Omnipotent attribute, I have receive a bit o\u2019 it.</p><br/><p>To be frank, isn\u2019t it impossible for ye to defeat Nee-san who have both demonic \u2018n\u2019 holy attribute?</p><br/><p>Although that Nii-san is also extremely dangerous, but it woull be less embarrassing if ye just be obedient, ye know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you really think so?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015well, I guess sae? Och well, I wull only force ye to stay here.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know whither there\u2019s a lot o\u2019 real body or fake ones\u2015\u2015 mibbie it\u2019s all real\u2015\u2015 a clone user is really troublesome.</p><br/><p>You see, even when I don\u2019t know th\u2019 real body, if I surround ye wi\u2019 spirit bomb, even you\u2019d not be able toe do anythin\u2019 richt?\u300d</p><br/><p>All of the knives have been already camouflaged by Laplace\u2019s Unique Skill \u300eDeceiver\u300f.</p><br/><p>Or rather, only his word is feigned, all of the knives are spirit bomb.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, he intended to kill Souei.</p><br/><p>\u300cFFu. Surround me you say? Such thing will be not significant if I can transfer.\u300d</p><br/><p>While Souei says so, he transfers with\u300eSpace Control\u300f.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s all according to Laplace\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahahahha! Nii-san, ye don\u2019t seem to be careful.</p><br/><p>The Spirit Bombs had been configured to chain explode due to dimensional vibration.</p><br/><p>It woull flows all at once into th\u2019 distorted space o\u2019 transfer series skill \u2018n\u2019 explode inside it!</p><br/><p>If ye receive that explosion, this side wull get entangled too \u2018n\u2019 receive damage, so t\u2019was fearful ye know.</p><br/><p>Well, th\u2019 cause o\u2019 yer defeat is that ye didn\u2019t notice mah puppet strings which had wrapped ye around.\u300d</p><br/><p>Laplace wraps the knife with his puppet strings and let it twined around Souei.</p><br/><p>Not only just that, he linked the knife with the other knives, which were flying nearby, and set it to react to the movement of the other clones.</p><br/><p>Hypothetically, if Souei didn\u2019t use his transfer ability, there would be no problem even if Souei come charging while ignoring the spirit bombs.</p><br/><p>Because even if most of this audience hall got blown away, it would be easy to retrieve his comrade that is Tear and Footman and to escape.</p><br/><p>Laplace fiddled with the timing of the explosion as it was not a problem for him.</p><br/><p>After all, with his Unique Skill\u300eSeer\u300f, he could see it clearly Souei\u2019s figure being swallowed up by the explosion.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Laplace begun his attack with conviction that he could surely kill Souei.</p><br/><p>Laplace laughs loudly, pleased that his plan would end well.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry, it\u2019s a bad place for you to be pleased so much, but let\u2019s end this soon.\u300d</p><br/><p>Laplace heard a cold voice from his back.</p><br/><p>And then, he cannot hide his surprise as a straight sword[2] stuck out from his chest.</p><br/><p>Laplace can\u2019t understand what happened.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Could do nothing but to speak such stupid word.</p><br/><p>It was simple when the truth was revealed.</p><br/><p>Souei from the beginning concealed his main body in the darkness.</p><br/><p>It was not his main body which was surrounded by the bombs, it was only one of his parallel existence.</p><br/><p>He calculated the position of Leon\u2019s castle with \u201cEye of the Moon\u201d of his Ultimate Gift\u300eShadow Moon[3] Lord Tsukuyomi\u300fand carried out a direct transfer to the inside of the barrier.</p><br/><p>And then, he concealed his main body with shadow using\u300eLaw Manipulation (Shadow)\u300f and launch a surprise attack with the effect of \u201cOne-hit Kill\u201d.</p><br/><p>Without any sign of naivety like Benimaru, that\u2019s Souei\u2019s way of fighting.</p><br/><p>But\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cGeez. I never think that mah younger brother\u2026\u2026 would git so easily killed lik\u2019 this\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYounger brother, you say? Mu!?\u300d</p><br/><p>In response of the blood thirst, Souei jumped aside from that spot.</p><br/><p>With the eyes which foresee everything, he sensed a danger simultaneously with an uncomfortable feeling.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the knife which stuck in Laplace\u2019s corpse was scattered by the explosion of the body.</p><br/><p>If his evasion was a bit late, Souei would rolled up in the explosion and would not come out unharmed.</p><br/><p>\u300cJust kidding~! Did ye really think that I have a younger brother?</p><br/><p>To tell you th\u2019 truth, I have a similar ability as ye too.</p><br/><p>The truth is, just lik\u2019 you I hud thought to dae a surprise attack, but that won\u2019t be guid, hence I reveal myself.</p><br/><p>Well~ it\u2019s been a while. For mah clone to be killed!\u300d</p><br/><p>Laplace spouts lies brazenly while preparing his surprise attack.</p><br/><p>He narrows his eyes and smiles.</p><br/><p>His behavior of making fool of someone is just like him, a hedonist.</p><br/><p>Marionette Master Clayman.</p><br/><p>Laplace is Clayman\u2019s master. He made a magic doll which modeled after himself and manipulated it with automatic operation.</p><br/><p>And, his target\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, it\u2019s been a long time since I rampaging seriously.</p><br/><p>For underestimating me, I\u2019ll show ye a painful experience. It\u2019s time for ye tae be prepared!]</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s you who need to be prepared. You need to stop the foolish delusions such as you defeating me, and you should immediately return to the darkness.\u300d</p><br/><p>And the two people fought each other and their fight reached a deadlock.</p><br/><p>Benimaru and Kazaream had broken through the barrier which Miazari had set up and also the city barrier, the two were now having a battle airspace high above.</p><br/><p>Kazaream begins to violently attacking Benimaru taking the advantage of his enormous energy.</p><br/><p>The fight between a fellow spiritual lifeform could be said as a struggle to investigated the enemy\u2019s energy. One would win if they deprived the enemy of their power and decreased their existence power.</p><br/><p>His Ultimate Skill was means for that, Kazaream made Benimaru consume his energy by effectively releasing his ability.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015No. He was under impression that he did so.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, how\u2019s it!! You can\u2019t counterattack!? What happened with your condescending attitude from before?\u300d</p><br/><p>Kazaream who rely fully on his power, concentrated his energy to his fists and hits Benimaru repeatedly.</p><br/><p>For Kazaream who been optimized by his Ultimate Skill\u300eDominion Lord Melchizedek\u300f, he was convinced that the Octagram won\u2019t be his opponent.</p><br/><p>In fact even Leon would be just like a baby in front of Kazaream.</p><br/><p>He was able to see that Mizari, who had been preaching before, was a worthless existence who could only receive a single blow from him.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>In front of his ultimate optimization called\u300eHoly Demonic Unification\u300f, which integrated the power of demon and angel, holy and demonic, he was confident that there was no angel nor demon that could be his equal.</p><br/><p>Kazaream thought that there was no reason for him to lose if himself was above in both quantity and the quality of the energy.</p><br/><p>In fact, he succeed in offsetting Leon\u2019s holy strike and even Mizari\u2019s demon power equally and adding a counterattack.</p><br/><p>Even if Kazaream does nothing, his enemies would destroy themselves on their own.</p><br/><p>It was the Counter lapse that Kazaream had devised.</p><br/><p>Of course he activated it when he was attacked.</p><br/><p>He let the damage accumulate by offsetting the attack while depriving the enemy\u2019s energy by crashing his energy.</p><br/><p>He won\u2019t lose unless his enemy surpasses his energy, it was an ability that ensure certain victory.</p><br/><p>And, as one of the Four Fiends of the Heavenly Commanders who have the strongest power, Kazaream thought that there was no other existence that\u2019s more superior than himself.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat happened!! Are you unable to do anything when I get serious?</p><br/><p>When you realized about my power, it has already be too late you see.</p><br/><p>What a fool. If you didn\u2019t obstruct me, you would have be able to live a little longer.</p><br/><p>I want to see Leon\u2019s crying face without any delay, so I will kill you soon.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kazaream was about to finish off Benimaru while laughing evilly.</p><br/><p>Kazaream was merry because of his strengthened ability, he was completely convinced that no one can oppose him.</p><br/><p>Certainly that it\u2019s a strong ability, it might be not weird for Kazaream to think so.</p><br/><p>However, it could be said that it was a too foolish act.</p><br/><p>Kazaream was convinced that his ability is the strongest and doesn\u2019t have weakness. Therefore, he was too overconfident with his ability.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, he didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>His attacks didn\u2019t do any damage to Benimaru.</p><br/><p>\u300cOra ora ora ora! How\u2019s that how\u2019s that!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Moreover Kazaream was getting carried away,</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up!\u300d</p><br/><p>The fist that Benimaru threw hit Kazaream\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u300cBuboaa!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Just with that one blow, it had robbed most of Kazaream\u2019s consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u300cBubaa, ha, a, gaa!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Kazaream turned his gaze to Benimaru with his eyes opened wide in astonishment.</p><br/><p>While looking like he\u2019s pitying Kazaream, Benimaru pointed out the reality.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour attacks doesn\u2019t work against me at all you see.\u300d</p><br/><p>So he said.</p><br/><p>Kazaream couldn\u2019t understand the meaning behind Benimaru\u2019s word</p><br/><p>That might be so.</p><br/><p>Kazaream was conceited that he had obtained the strongest power; because until just now, he had stood as the strongest.</p><br/><p>And yet, that there is an enemy whom his attacks wouldn\u2019t work against is something that he would never deem as possible.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo, don\u2019t be joking! Wha, what a stupid thing to say!!</p><br/><p>Is, is that so\u2026\u2026 I understood! It\u2019s a bluff, you must be bluffing!</p><br/><p>Hahaha, what a shrewd guy. I won\u2019t get deceived by such foolish lie!\u300d</p><br/><p>He unreasonably interpret the fact on his own.</p><br/><p>Then, he condensed his energy with the maximum output in both his hands, and took a stance toward Benimaru.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re finished.</p><br/><p>Even if I fall into your tricks, you would be hopeless in front of my absolute power.</p><br/><p>How~ unfortunate! A fool won\u2019t understand it.\u300d</p><br/><p>Grinning and sprouting a smile, Kazaream regained his composure and felt the reliable power in both of his hands.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, good bye. If you want to resent, resent your own powerlessness! Arc Depression (Ruler\u2019s Melancholy)!!!</p><br/><p>What he had shot out was a dreadful energy wave that could be called as Holy Demonic Wave Cannon which would rapidly exhaust the target\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>Even with speed surpassing dozens of times the speed of sound, it might be impossible to avoid it, and that sure-kill wave was rushing towards Benimaru.</p><br/><p>But, there was no change in Benimaru\u2019s expression, with his cherished katana \u201cGuren\u201d in his hand, he calmly took a stance.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you know? Speed is power. In other words\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Swinging his beloved katana, Benimaru ward off Kazaream\u2019s sure-kill attack and nullified it with his Rebirth Flame.</p><br/><p>He could have counterattacked, but he deliberately held back.</p><br/><p>Because he was going to kill Kazaream with the next attack.</p><br/><p>\u300cHa? Huh!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Kazaream who opened his eyes wide to their limits was astonished.</p><br/><p>He witnessed an impossible spectacle in front of his eyes and his mind can\u2019t catch up with it.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, such a dull attack of yours can\u2019t reach me you know.</p><br/><p>In other words, it means that your attack can\u2019t effect me.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s one thing I can praise you for, you were certainly superior than me only in the total amount of power.</p><br/><p>But, if it\u2019s about the quality, I\u2019m overwhelming superior than you.</p><br/><p>Just that.</p><br/><p>Can you understand it?</p><br/><p>Then, die! Prominence Acceleration!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Kazaream\u2019s movement stopped as he was too astonished and had entered a panic state, received Benimaru\u2019s special attack.</p><br/><p>The black sunlight which took the shape of an Oriental dragon swallowed half of Kazaream\u2019s body while moving as if it has its own will.</p><br/><p>The quality was exactly like Benimaru had stated, the nature of the released energy was so terrifying like a Tyrant.</p><br/><p>The reason was because the nihility energy that his adored and respected master, the Great Demon Lord Rimuru has.</p><br/><p>Some of Rimuru\u2019s subordinates had approached to the nihility nature of Rimuru through the Soul\u2019s Corridor.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it wasn\u2019t weird for Benimaru to offsetting Kazaream\u2019s attack which had the holy and demonic attributes.</p><br/><p>It was blocked by Benimaru\u2019s energy which superior in quality and the attack was nullified.</p><br/><p>Although it can\u2019t be compared with Rimuru the originator, as the original was moving in super high speed and had enhanced energy, it was still a finishing move.</p><br/><p>In all aspects, it may be said that Benimaru was skillful.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch. I still can\u2019t control it perfectly yet.\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru grumbled.</p><br/><p>Although he had no complaint about the power, the accuracy didn\u2019t go as he wanted.</p><br/><p>The technique was a technique in which Rimuru instructed Benimaru to imitate Cardinal Acceleration which was the ultimate attack of the \u201cScorch Dragon\u201d Velgrind.</p><br/><p>Unlike Velgrind who was a high density spiritual lifeform by nature, it was still premature for Benimaru to master it, seeing that he had just finished evolving.</p><br/><p>But, Benimaru\u2019s ability was the Ultimate Skill\u300eBlazing Sun[4] Lord Amaterasu\u300f, with Light and Heat Control (acceleration) as the abilities crux, there were still a lot of things which he could learn from Velgrind\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p> Or rather\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>(It just my guess, but I think I inherited the ability that Rimuru-sama acquired from Velgrind-sama.)</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Benimaru comprehended.</p><br/><p>And\u2015\u2015 Zegion, Ranga and the other, might have inherit the ability from Veldora-sama.</p><br/><p>As for Diablo,</p><br/><p>(That guy seem to inherit a direct ability from Rimuru-sama.)</p><br/><p>So, he remembered the opponent he engaged in desperate struggles inside the labyrinth for many times.</p><br/><p>Using the labyrinth characteristic where they can\u2019t die, Benimaru and Diablo had performed real combat trainings over and over again.</p><br/><p>The result was his complete defeat on every match.</p><br/><p>Aside from places the public can watch such as the Tournament, Diablo never holds back against his opponent.</p><br/><p>(Although it\u2019s good that I had a glimpse of the end of his strength, that fellow, I\u2019ll beat him someday!)</p><br/><p>\u2018Kufufufufu\u2019. Benimaru felt a bit unpleasant as he remembered Diablo\u2019s loud laugh.</p><br/><p>Benimaru knew about it, but recently Diablo seemed to be considerably feigning ignorance in front of Rimuru.</p><br/><p> However, if it might be said that, on the contrary, it could thought that he was close with Diablo that he could saw his hidden true self.</p><br/><p>While forcibly making himself agreed to it, Benimaru moved his gaze to Kazaream who fell down and went towards him to deliver the final blow.</p><br/><p>[1] Not the brother meaning but for young man, laddie.</p><br/><p>[2]  Chokutou lit.

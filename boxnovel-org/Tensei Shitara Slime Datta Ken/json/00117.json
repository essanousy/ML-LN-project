Pride?</p><br/><p>Not at all. It was a far more practical reason.</p><br/><p>Seems like Basson\u2019s acquired weapon, the longsword, was pretty damn good.</p><br/><p>Compared to adventurer\u2019s equipment, that is.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I had thought it was Kurobee\u2019s work, but it was one of his disciple\u2019s.</p><br/><p>And this disciple\u2019s longsword, if ranked normally, would be a high class blade.</p><br/><p>At best, it could be ranked as a Special high class blade.</p><br/><p>On the market place, a high quality sword is ten times the price. A special blade is fifty times.</p><br/><p>Of those who can acquire one, even those affiliated with the army may have a hard time.</p><br/><p>So I can completely understand the sudden change in passion.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, rascals, behold! Doesn\u2019t this beautiful blade fit me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Thanks to Basson\u2019s shameless boasting, we have had more guests recently.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, he is good publicity for our country, so I am thankful.</p><br/><p>But, when it all comes down to it, he isn\u2019t one to plan these things.</p><br/><p>Now, even those with half a brain-cell are listening to ur explanation and are using the first floor to practice.</p><br/><p>Having practiced there, they return to arrange their equipment (which, of course, adds to our profit) and again challenge the dungeon.</p><br/><p>And thus, we have those who were able to clear the third floor.</p><br/><p>Floors 3-5 are easily cleared with proper mapping skills, so they were able to clear them.</p><br/><p>The rest is all up to actual ability.</p><br/><p>And by the time these adventurers left the labyrinth, the adventurers from various countries came piling in because of rumors.</p><br/><p>Which led to a fierce race to conquer the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Some, of course, started selling maps, so we decided to announce that the labyrinth will be changing.</p><br/><p>You have to draw your own map, or it\u2019s meaningless. Map drawing is a fundamental skill they all need to survive.</p><br/><p>Based on their estimates, it takes 2-3 days to clear a floor; at best, a day.</p><br/><p>Which is why all the adventurers tacitly agreed to hold a strategy meeting each time the labyrinth changes.</p><br/><p>Adventurers affiliated with the Freedom Association were clearly on a different level.</p><br/><p>They formed teams not composed solely of monster extermination team, but also of gatherers and scavengers.</p><br/><p>So they are very adaptable. Having heard the explanation, they quickly understood the rules.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it will be too easy for them.</p><br/><p>And their clearing speed only proved the fact.</p><br/><p>Particularly those versed in Elemental magic: they use spirits to select the correct path to the next floor.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s cheating! Elemental magic is cheating!</p><br/><p>I asked Ramiris about it, and</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yeah! Totally didn\u2019t think of that!</p><br/><p>But, that just means they are really liked by the spirits, so they are trustworthy!\u300d</p><br/><p>She responded.</p><br/><p>Well, not like all of them can communicate with spirits, and those who use elemental magic are few among them.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to act against them yet. In fact, I would rather commend their resourcefulness.</p><br/><p>Moreover, ruin explorers are rather good at identifying traps.</p><br/><p>They are able to carefully judge a treasure chest. They are worlds different than simple barmen, and are approaching this as their profession.</p><br/><p>Thus, the labyrinth is slowly being cleared and the number of challengers is ever increasing.</p><br/><p>We again gathered to discuss the current state of affairs.</p><br/><p>Unlike last time, things are proceeding smoothly, so we are merry.</p><br/><p>Basically: we are all smiles.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, Masayuki, did you say you were?</p><br/><p>I had thought I saw potential in you, but you are quite the man\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora haughtily praised Masayuki the moment we gathered.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, is that so? Uh, thanks\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki replied, surprised at the sudden praise.</p><br/><p>With a \u201cWho the hell is this guy?\u201d kind of look.</p><br/><p>Yo, he was here last time, I introduced you two\u2026 did you forget who he was because of how nervous you were?</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, this is my best friend, Veldora-san.</p><br/><p>I introduced you last time, right?</p><br/><p>This is Ramiris, the fairy master of the labyrinth\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAy, I shall recognize you, Masayuki\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYahoo! You\u2019re great. This success is all thanks to you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Unlike last time, perhaps due to recognizing his existence, they are smiling at him.</p><br/><p>He returned their smiles.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, thanks. I\u2019m Masayuki. Satoru\u2026 like Rimuru, I am a world traveler. They call me a hero, but that\u2019s just a joke so please ignore it\u300d</p><br/><p>Unlike last time, he properly introduced himself.</p><br/><p>What a grand improvement. Unlike last time, they recognized Masayuki and are now able to hold a conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut Ramiris is a fairy, huh. To be able to create such an amazing labyrinth\u2026 you are amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p>Upon Masayuki\u2019s praise,</p><br/><p>\u300cEh! You, I like you. I\u2019ll make you my follower.</p><br/><p>And did you hear, Rimuru? He said I\u2019m amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p>Coming at me with a drop kick, Ramiris exclaimed with great pride.</p><br/><p>How annoying.</p><br/><p>I easily evade the drop kick,</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, right. Amazing, amazing. That aside, if Masayuki wants to follow you, I have no problem with that, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>I respond.</p><br/><p>A demon lord and a hero. I guess that\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, what kind of person is Ramiris-san?</p><br/><p>And, what about Veldora\u2026san? Rimuru\u2019s friend?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, yeah. Did you not know?</p><br/><p>Ramiris is one of the demon lords. And Veldora is a dragon\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh, what? Demon lord and a dragon? EHH? Seriously~su?!\u300d</p><br/><p>Masayuki\u2026</p><br/><p>Considering his behavior last time, I thought he just had guts.</p><br/><p>But he simply did not know. Ignorance is bliss.</p><br/><p>And now that he knows, that they are a dragon and a demon lord, it seems his soul has escaped his body\u2026</p><br/><p>To have been recognized while yet ignorant, this guy is seriously lucky.</p><br/><p>Does it have anything to do with his \u300eHeroic Disposition\u300f\u2013 that is, are his surroundings themselves affected?</p><br/><p>Thinking of these things, I decided to ask of Masayuki.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, well, I did plan to disable the skill, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eYou negotiated with the demon lord and decrease the difficulty of the dungeon\u2026 as expected of our hero!!!\u300f</p><br/><p>My comrades said, praising my name.</p><br/><p>And, well, they are inside that dungeon, so let me say my thanks\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Is what he said.</p><br/><p>So his luck is not related to a skill but is rather his natural disposition.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m honestly surprised.</p><br/><p>Having thus finished our self-introductions, we turned to the matter on the table.</p><br/><p>Our sales are going well.</p><br/><p>Myormiles is very happy.</p><br/><p>The challengers drop out and challenge the labyrinth again and again.</p><br/><p>They come buying our items again and again, so we easily service a thousand people a day.</p><br/><p>Now, as per Masayuki\u2019s suggestion: drops.</p><br/><p>We need to figure something out about monsters dropping items and unidentified equipment.</p><br/><p>But, drops are a surprisingly difficult topic. Normally, monsters would drop raw materials or stones at most\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy is this necessary?\u300d</p><br/><p>Veldora asked.</p><br/><p>The response,</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? Well, there are those who don\u2019t naturally recover and would suffer a defeat as a result, right? So, I thought: wouldn\u2019t it be nice if monsters dropped potions? And, as for unidentified equipment: when they pick it up, they\u2019d need to leave the labyrinth to have it appraised, right? And by providing such a service we could make a bit more money. We could also mix in some poison with those potions\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Getting treasure from treasure chests and some trash from monsters, huh?</p><br/><p>Unidentified, huh; that does excite me. I\u2019d be very excited while having it appraised.</p><br/><p>Maybe we\u2019ll also raise difficulty in parts where there are such drops.</p><br/><p>And I bet there will be those who pack up full of trashy drops to sell back in town.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. Well, that be as it may, shall we shift labyrinth around now?\u300d</p><br/><p>I ask. Overall, I\u2019m rather satisfied with how things are going.</p><br/><p>\u300cSounds good\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris said, like a know-it-all.</p><br/><p>Hey, do you seriously understand what I just asked? I sent a glance at her, but she averted her eyes.</p><br/><p>So she was just going with the flow. Crafty rascal.</p><br/><p>That aside,</p><br/><p>We all nodded, having come to a general consensus.</p><br/><p>Having monsters swallow trash proved very easy, in fact.</p><br/><p>Trainee and the Dryad helped with that.</p><br/><p>After space magic to place trash in front of them the monsters just swallow it.</p><br/><p>Monsters spawn randomly on the begining floor, so there\u2019s nothing we can do about that, but floors past 6 have monster rooms, so those we can prepare in advance.</p><br/><p>By delivering magical energy via pipes we can control when a monster will spawn, and in front of them we can then drop an item.</p><br/><p>Of course, some of the items will be held by trap-monsters, but there\u2019s nothing you can do about that.</p><br/><p>Managing the spawning of all the monsters would be a pain, if not for just having them spawn in a single room.</p><br/><p>We fill a room with monsters, distribute the times, and release the monsters.</p><br/><p>Thus, we are able to quickly fill the dungeon with drops.</p><br/><p>And thus our dungeon is nearing completion.</p><br/><p>The 95th floor we made into a city.</p><br/><p>For the elven women who clean, cook, and manage our inns.</p><br/><p>They are a wonderful workforce, and I\u2019ll have them leave in that city.</p><br/><p>Of course, not just the women, but also the men.</p><br/><p>The treants and the dryads already took root there, building a city of trees.</p><br/><p>And thus a beautiful town appeared amidst the floor.</p><br/><p>A city of Fairies.</p><br/><p>The elves will surely be calmer living among the trees.</p><br/><p>Accordingly, they expressed their joy with gratitude. And immigrated their with hearts full of hope.</p><br/><p>Of course, they are able to manage inns and bars by themselves.</p><br/><p>There are a number of man-made inns on that floors, just as there are at other save points.</p><br/><p>Managing it all is an elder treant.</p><br/><p>Oh, and as there is a chance that treants spawn in this labyrinth, we decided to have them guide and support adventurers along.</p><br/><p>Of course, they gladly accepted.</p><br/><p>Thus we finished remodeling the labyrinth, and our workload decreased a level.</p><br/><p>Seems like the time to refresh the floors came again.</p><br/><p>By the time we finished the dungeon, someone had broken throughthe tenth floor.</p><br/><p>According to the announcement, the guardian of the 10th floor, the Ogre Lord had appeared.</p><br/><p>The town was rather festive</p><br/><p>The group to have broke through that far was Hero Masayuki\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u300eMa~sayuki, Ma~~sayuki!!\u300f</p><br/><p>They cheered.</p><br/><p>Though his expression was a cramped smile, it must have appeared dazzling to the onlookers.</p><br/><p>The Ogre Lord was a \u201cB+\u201d ranked monster, but clearly no foe for Masayuki\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>In fact, his comrades are rather skilled, and able to escape even tough situations unscathed.</p><br/><p>Ogre Lord drops items from the ogre series.</p><br/><p>The drops this time were: ogre axe and oxe shin guard.</p><br/><p>As part of a series, it\u2019s a rare item.</p><br/><p>Weapon choice is random. Try your luck again if you didn\u2019t like it.</p><br/><p>But just a look at this weapon made the adventurers\u2019 eyes change.</p><br/><p>Up until now they had aimed at marginal profit but all of that changed now.</p><br/><p>A boss appears once every hour and if he gets defeated one needs to wait another hour.</p><br/><p>And when a boss gets defeated, a save point floor appears.</p><br/><p>Once you cross beyond this floor, you can never return to this boss fight.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s to prevent people from monopolizing the boss.</p><br/><p>This boss drops an item box.</p><br/><p>So you don\u2019t know what kind of gear you get before you open it. Regardless of the type, though, it will be part of the ogre series.</p><br/><p>And as a \u201cB+\u201d ranked boss, it certainly can be defeated by a well-prepared team of six.</p><br/><p>News of this quickly spread among all the adventurers.</p><br/><p>Greatly increasing the number of challengers.</p><br/><p>Just as planned.</p><br/><p>By now, there is not a single person in the world who has not heard of Tempest, the city of the labyrinth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We are cyborgs, but people think we\u2019re weak without the Powered Suits. Well, they wouldn\u2019t be entirely wrong, but Mister Veldora\u2019s modification skills are incredible. I haven\u2019t even received much damage from Jegyll\u2019s attack just now. And the repairing ability is also great. It seems that my stomach injury will be completely healed in just three minutes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I see! In that case, maybe the Powered Suits\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes. They might still be usable. So don\u2019t lose hope, alright? If we can only escape from this supply transport ship\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He had said as much. And then that hope was cruelly crushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Jegyll. We have finished. The Powered Suits have been completely destroyed, as you ordered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reiz said as he entered the bridge with a foolish smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. And the results of the analysis?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did try and get some data, but much of it was impossible to analyze with the equipment on board this ship. While it was a waste, I prioritized its destruction. After all, they would have combat abilities to match the Empire\u2019s Cyborg Soldiers if they put those on. So it was obvious they had to be destroyed. But, then again, they would still have no chance against us Bionoids. Perhaps I was being paranoid?\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how advanced the weapon was, it could be easily destroyed before it was used.</p><br/><p>Reiz said with a laugh.</p><br/><p>This meant that Karman\u2019s last hope was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Damn you all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? He\u2019s still alive. Miss Jegyll, did you go easy on him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought he was just some mad dog, but he turned out to be tougher than I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. But then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Reiz smiled mischievously. His right hand then transformed into a blade.</p><br/><p>He meant to deal the final blow with that.</p><br/><p>But just then\u2026</p><br/><p>There was a loud bang followed by a small explosion.</p><br/><p>Part of the ship\u2019s control computers had been shot with a blaster.</p><br/><p>\u2018Warning. The ship\u2019s control systems have encountered a fatal error. This ship will crash in 50 seconds. I repeat. This ship\u2019s control systems have encountered a fatal error. This ship will crash in 50 seconds\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The automatic alarm played. The scene immediately became frantic.</p><br/><p>Karman smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. Well, there you go. We may not be able to win like this, but now that the ship is out of your control, we can take you down with us. This ship is going to kiss the ground faster than the speed of sound. So, are you tough enough to survive that?\u201d</p><br/><p>He pulled out a cigar as he said this with a look of confidence.</p><br/><p>He put the cigar in his mouth and inhaled before slowly exhaling the smoke.</p><br/><p>His men were also smiling and laughing. Not one of them had a fear of death.</p><br/><p>They were ready to do what they had to has military men.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow troublesome. This cannot be fixed. Who would have thought they had blasters hidden on them. I underestimated you as some meathead, Mister Karman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow vexing. This is why I hate dogs. I have no idea why Michelle ever thought you ruffians would be useful to her? And why have I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Reiz said with a shrug, and Jegyll shook her head and continued.</p><br/><p>However, Reiz then said something that crushed all of Karman\u2019s confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo bad, Mister Karman. But we are able to escape this ship, even though it is moving at such a speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? Unlike you ancient cyborgs, Bionoids are special.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. I wanted to kill you with my hands, but it appears there is no time. I don\u2019t want to die here with you, so we\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConsider this ship a present, Mister Karman. Enjoy your luxury coffin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll and Reiz said before evacuating.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you! Come back here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman\u2019s shout echoed sadly.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>This was all according to Karman\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew. That was amazing, captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work on that acting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe somehow made it through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow we just have to survive this crash\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His men said.</p><br/><p>Karman looked at them and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damn idiots! There\u2019s no time to waste. Gather around!\u201d</p><br/><p>He ordered, and they came together in a circle.</p><br/><p>Karman looked at them and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry about that. But that\u2019s what you get when you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>They stayed silent.</p><br/><p>However, they all had mischievous grins on their faces. No one looked like they regretted being there.</p><br/><p>Karman chuckled before continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to Mister Veldora, my battle body has the same structure as General Michelle. In other words, I can use the Ether Ring Barrier that only the Machinery Four can use. It might sound unbelievable, but I can see it in my brain menu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it was a joke too. But you\u2019ll have to trust me on this. Well, trust Veldora anyway\u2026as hard as that may be.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he was lying, then they would all die.</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t, they might just survive this.</p><br/><p>In that case, Karman would laugh and believe\u2014that was the path they would take.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u20262 seconds until the crash.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, here it goes! Ether Ring Barrier!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman howled. The thermonuclear fusion reactor converted all of his energy into special wavelengths\u2014and a ring of black particles surrounded Karman and his men.</p><br/><p>Veldora, Ramiris, and Beretta had modified the faulty feature until it was as close to the original as possible.</p><br/><p>Ether Ring Barrier\u2014theoretically, it was a powerful shield that protected you from almost any attack.</p><br/><p>\u2013And now, the 70-meter medium-sized transport ship was moving at a dozen times faster than the speed of sound\u2014and it was about to crash into the ground\u2014</p><br/><p>And Karman and his men entrusted their lives to this shield.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>There was an earth-shattering sound.</p><br/><p>It was an explosion so large that it was as if the sun had fallen to the earth.</p><br/><p>\u2014Six Tyrant\u2014</p><br/><p>A weapon of the devil that the Empire had created.</p><br/><p>That being said, the principle was quite simple.</p><br/><p>An Ether Ring Barrier would be created for a brief moment. At the same time, at the peak of the hexagram in the center of the Ether Ring Barrier, six gigaton-grade atomic bombs would go off.</p><br/><p>The shock waves and heat that would result from this would not be able to be contained within the Ether Ring Barrier. This will cause unimaginable destructive power to be created inside of it.</p><br/><p>That was the Six Tyrant.</p><br/><p>With such power before them, even the Machinery Four would not go unscathed.</p><br/><p>While surprise attacks wouldn\u2019t work on them and they could protect themselves with Ether Ring Barrier, they would likely still be burned to death before the rage of the explosion died down.</p><br/><p>It was such a horrifying superweapon that now turned its fangs on Veldora and the others\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

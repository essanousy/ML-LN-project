Had it really been necessary to return my hair and eye color back to normal?</p><br/><p>I had gotten a little carried away, but it was nothing short of an act that would accelerate the exposing of my identity.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;Do not worry. You looked very cool.&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Uh, is that a good reason?</p><br/><p>\u2026Well, alright then.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the most convincing argument, but it can\u2019t be bad if Ciel says it\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>Now, before I quickly defeat Bernaclad, I should think about the students, just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaplace! Protect the students here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Faithfully, Laplace obeyed my order and constructed a defense barrier over the barrier that was already there.</p><br/><p>In fact, it would be rather difficult for me in my current state to hold off the shockwaves of Laplace and Bernaclad, should they battle.</p><br/><p>And of course, neither could the students.</p><br/><p>And so I could not leave the fighting to Laplace.</p><br/><p>Tear was not likely able to beat Bernaclad, so the best option was to fight him myself.</p><br/><p>In any case, now the students\u2019 safety was assured.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong a demon Bernaclad was, Laplace was an awakened demon lord. If he created a defense barrier, no attack would break through it.</p><br/><p>The only thing left to do was for me to defeat Bernaclad.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. You think one little insect is going to be enough to entertain me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bernaclad said confidently as he looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well, he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, if the others find out later that he talked to Rimuru like that, and that we didn\u2019t do anything\u2026 Won\u2019t they be furious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Tear. Don\u2019t say such ominous things. If Souei and Diablo found out about this\u2026 I don\u2019t want to even imagine what they might do to us. They won\u2019t stop, regardless of Lord Rimuru\u2019s forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, thankfully, we\u2019re the only ones here now. So let\u2019s keep it a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Otherwise, we\u2019ll end up in the worst kind of danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could hear their hushed voices whispering to each other, but it was me who said that I would fight, so they were not responsible.</p><br/><p>Besides, in a way, it couldn\u2019t be helped that people would underestimate me now.</p><br/><p>After all, I was no different than any other human.</p><br/><p>So Bernaclad\u2019s estimation of me wasn\u2019t particularly wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t think it will be that fun for you. It\u2019s nothing personal, but I don\u2019t like to hold back. If you want to be angry about it, don\u2019t hate me, hate yourself for having the wrong amount of strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said to Bernaclad, without much interest.</p><br/><p>Really, there wasn\u2019t any deeper meaning to my words.</p><br/><p>If he had been just a little weaker, just enough so that the Rock Elephant and the others could have stopped him\u2026I would not have had to annihilate him.</p><br/><p>Or if I had one other awakened demon lord with me now, I would be able to disarm Bernaclad while still protecting the students.</p><br/><p>But then again, Diablo, Souei or Shion and Benimaru would have turned him into dust without a second thought. So perhaps there really was no other fate for him other than death.</p><br/><p>Now that I think of it, it\u2019s not I, the Great Demon Lord, but my subordinates who are dangerous and extreme.</p><br/><p>It was quite impressive that I was able to hold everything together.</p><br/><p>I was doing quite well, really.</p><br/><p>&lt;&lt;\u2026&gt;&gt;</p><br/><p>Oh.</p><br/><p>Ciel seemed like she wanted to say something, but I\u2019d rather not hear it.</p><br/><p>I have to stop thinking about stupid things and deal with Bernaclad.</p><br/><p>Bernaclad did not exactly like what I had just said.</p><br/><p>I had condescendingly informed him of his impending defeat, so it was no wonder he wasn\u2019t too amused.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaahaha. What a delightful person you are. However, you should know that such foolishness and misunderstanding of your own worth will do nothing but invite misfortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled and showed no sign of moving.</p><br/><p>Then he shrugged, sending great bursts of magic from his hands.</p><br/><p>The nuclear strike magic, \u2018Nuclear Flame\u2019 burned everything around me. And burned the students behind me as well\u2013or so it would have looked to Bernaclad.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Dying in one hit is hardly entertaining, you know? Not only that, but I was looking forward to slowly savoring the taste of those students. But a few of them seem to have been caught in the attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a hint of regret in his voice as he watched the blazing furnace he had created.</p><br/><p>He believed in the energy and force of the magic he unleashed without any doubt.</p><br/><p>Too bad!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right? You said it was one hit. But I was merely offering you the first move. Didn\u2019t I tell you? It\u2019s nothing personal. And so I thought that I might as well show off a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had used \u2018Teleportation\u2019 to move to the top of a boulder that was behind Bernaclad, and sat down. That is when I spoke, all the while feeling a little sorry for him.</p><br/><p>And of course, the students were all fine.</p><br/><p>Laplace had predicted this, and created a \u2018Multi-purpose Barrier\u2019 that isolated the students from the battlefield.</p><br/><p>It was when Bernaclad finally realized this truth, that he was overcome with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did what? Just now, what happened!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as he asked the question, he slashed at me at a speed that even my eyes could not follow.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Magnus\u2019s sword was quite sharp, and it cut the boulder I was sitting on in two.</p><br/><p>But, it did not hit me.</p><br/><p>While my eyes couldn\u2019t follow it, \u2018Magic Perception\u2019 and \u2018Godspeed Thought\u2019 allowed me to see Bernclad\u2019s movements and predict them.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"c-select-bottom\"><div class=\"wp-manga-nav\"><div class=\"select-view\"><div class=\"c-selectpicker selectpicker_chapter\"></div></div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

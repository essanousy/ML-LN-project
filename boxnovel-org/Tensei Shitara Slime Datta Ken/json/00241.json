Veldora-sama, I can deal with them alone if it\u2019s these people, though?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKuhahahaha, what are you saying? No need to hold back, let me help you too!\u300d</p><br/><p>As if he was getting impatient, Veldora insisted to Diablo who coolly smiled.</p><br/><p>For Veldora, his true intention was that he didn\u2019t want to be near his sister\u2015\u2015Velgrind whose complexion changed since she saw Rudra. Therefore, he had to have an opponent by all means.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, Veldora-sama\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm. That guy in military uniform was the man who bombarded me with bullets. I shall pay him back and be his opponent here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, in that case, I shall be the opponent of the other one.\u300d</p><br/><p>After the brief exchange of words, Veldora and Diablo moved simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Damrada and Diablo exchanged blows.</p><br/><p>With a saber[1] in his right hand and handgun in his left, Kondou attacked Veldora.</p><br/><p>The shock waves generated by their intense clashes shook the heaven.</p><br/><p>And then, the two pairs ascertained each other\u2019s prey and left the place.</p><br/><p>Looking at them with a sideways glance, Velgrind started to ponder.</p><br/><p>Both Damrada and Kondou had served as Emperor Rudra\u2019s trusted retainers for a long time. Therefore, Velgrind also knew the two of them very well, even their characters and abilities.</p><br/><p>They had unprecedented power with a human body and not the type of people who would be arrogant and careless.</p><br/><p>They were certainly a threat as the two of them had obtained power far transcending awakened demon lord.</p><br/><p>However\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cVeldora, I won\u2019t have any mercy on you if you let your guard down, you know!\u300d</p><br/><p>So, Velgrind called out to Veldora before changing her line of sight to Rudra.</p><br/><p>Although they certainly were powerful, their power hadn\u2019t reached the level of a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d yet. She believed that she didn\u2019t need to worry if Veldora fought one of them.</p><br/><p>(However, if he fights horribly, I\u2019ll punish him.)</p><br/><p>So, Velgrind moved while thinking about things that would make Veldora shudder.</p><br/><p>At the moment when Guy tried to swing his sword down towards Velda, a sword of light came interrupting from the side and stopped the sword.</p><br/><p>It was the deed of the man who stood in front of Velda, Rudra.</p><br/><p>As they were, both of them shifted their position to cross their swords and swung it fluently.</p><br/><p>Both of them didn\u2019t carry a shield as they were in a stance of complete attack.</p><br/><p>For them, their swords were their weapon and shield.</p><br/><p>\u300cHee, interesting. It seems your skills aren\u2019t getting duller, Guy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSkip your blabbering, a fake like you won\u2019t bother me!\u300d</p><br/><p>The two of them shouted and struck each other with full power blow.</p><br/><p>That blow had power enough to deliver a deadly blow. However, both of them skillfully parried it off and were unable to deal any injury on their opponent</p><br/><p>Astonishingly, the fake Rudra had become an embodiment of perfect strength.</p><br/><p>The proof was that the fake Rudra had complete control of the temporary body which condensed from a tremendous amount of energy.</p><br/><p>It was an unbelievable thing for Velgrind, but the fake Rudra\u2019s strength rivaled Guy.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuy, I\u2019ll assist you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIdiot, don\u2019t come here\u30fc\u30fc!!\u300d</p><br/><p>It happened in an instant.</p><br/><p>At the moment Velgrind tried to slash the fake Rudra with her Godspeed Saberclaw[2] to assist Guy with her claws which turned into swords.\u2015\u2015she felt a terrible pain in her arm.</p><br/><p>(Impossible!? I felt pain even though this body has\u300ePain Nullification\u300f!?)</p><br/><p>Astonished, Velgrind leaped back.</p><br/><p>\u300cHeee, My skill has gotten duller. I intended to chop off your neck though. No, I guess you have become stronger\u2015\u2015 Right, Velgrind?\u300d</p><br/><p>For the first time, Velgrind stared at the fake Rudra.</p><br/><p>That young man ought to be an imitation of Rudra in his youth.</p><br/><p>Even Velgrind\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t distinguish the fake in front of her with the real one, as it had completely reproduced his strength down to his roughness\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(Impossible. I cared for you till the end, Rudra\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026.. You are a fake!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHaa! Don\u2019t make me laugh, Velgrind. I\u2019m the one who decides that. I\u2019m a fake because I have no soul? I\u2019m a fake because I got revived? I\u2019m a fake because I\u2019m being controlled? All wrong. I become a fake when I admit I\u2019m a fake and my Will dies. I\u2019m alive, you know? I\u2019m thinking, choosing and moving on. I\u2019m me and nobody else! You know that right, Velgrind? Okay, I will admit that it\u2019s true I have died once. Therefore, I will start over from the beginning. I will beat you guys once so you guys will acknowledge my greatness. Then, I\u2019ll make you guys my companion. I\u2019m the man who will eventually conquer the world. That is my promise with \u201cStellar Lord Dragon\u201d Veldanava who is also my master after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>He laughed off to Velgrind\u2019s shout.</p><br/><p>And then, Rudra erased his sword of light, the materialization of his aura and smiled fearlessly.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt will be rude for me to fight with such a toy, right. I will show you what I\u2019m made of.\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying so, he held up both of his hands and muttered\u300eDivine Sword Summon[3]\u300f.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the time-space between Rudra\u2019s hands cracked and a radiant sword manifested.</p><br/><p>Looking at that, Guy\u2019s red eyes kindled with joy and he smiled deeper.</p><br/><p>In shock and confusion, Velgrind took a step back.</p><br/><p>Then, while showing a smile to Guy, Rudra held up his sword and said.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s settle our fight for sure today, Guy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHumph. That's just what I wanted, Rudra!![4]\u300d</p><br/><p>What is Divine Sword Summon? It\u2019s a ritual to bring out the sword he used against his opponent only when he got serious.</p><br/><p>For him to be able to summon the sword which chose its owner\u2015\u2015Divine Sword \u201cStar[5]\"\u2015\u2015 regardless whether the man in front of his eyes is a fake or a real one, he probably has a similar Will to Rudra who was Guy\u2019s friend.</p><br/><p>(Even after dying, you are still going to stand before me and get in my path, heh? You probably won\u2019t let me quit when I\u2019m ahead; you truly are a guy who hated losing.[6])</p><br/><p>Guy was happy and couldn\u2019t hide the smile sprouting on his mouth.</p><br/><p>Guy already didn\u2019t care about Velda and other things and immersed himself in his fight with Rudra.</p><br/><p>And, Velgrind too\u2015\u2015 she decided to watch over the two of them.</p><br/><p>The rule agreed upon between Guy and Rudra from a very long time ago didn\u2019t permit Velgrind and Velzard to interfere in their fight.</p><br/><p>While Velgrind was watching, their fight grew fiercer\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p> \u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Velzard also felt a similar shock like Velgrind.</p><br/><p>However, she was Guy\u2019s partner so it could be said the shock she felt was smaller than Velgrind.</p><br/><p>More importantly, thanks to the bonds with Guy she felt earlier, she never got agitated when she saw Rudra.</p><br/><p>Velzard was treating Milim\u2019s injury indifferently without showing astonishment on her face.</p><br/><p>She looked at Chloe who before she noticed was confronting Velda and stalling with her swordplay.</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s injury was not as bad as she expected, so Velzard was relieved that Milim would recover soon at this rate.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry, I\u2019m okay now.\u300d</p><br/><p>As Velzard expected, Milim recovered immediately.</p><br/><p>Moreover, even though she was completely unable to compete with Velda just a while ago, Milim tried to rush towards Velda without learning any lessons from before.</p><br/><p>\u300cMilim, is there any chance of winning?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? There\u2019s none. But well, I might hit on some kind of idea while fighting, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s not good\u201d so Velzard thought.</p><br/><p>Just as she expected, Milim was being toyed with by Velda.</p><br/><p>\u300cGrrr, you agile bastard!\u300d</p><br/><p>While Velzard was watching, it seemed Milim was refining her fighting spirit steadily, even while she was cursing, but\u2026\u2026Her energy didn\u2019t increase greatly as Velzard imagined.</p><br/><p>Although it was larger than an awakened demon lord, it was only 10% compared to a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>(\u2015\u2015That\u2019s odd. Compared with the enormous energy she had when she fought Guy, I think Milim\u2019s current strength is too small though\u2026...)</p><br/><p>Guy and Rudra were fighting equally.</p><br/><p>If Velzard got in the way, she would obviously incur Guy\u2019s wrath, so she couldn\u2019t do anything but to leave them be.</p><br/><p>It seemed her younger brother, Veldora, had become very impudent and stubborn before she noticed, but she decided that it would be alright to ignore him.</p><br/><p>Moreover, because Guy and Rudra began immersing themselves in their fight, Velgrind could afford to pay attention to Veldora and others. Even while watching the two fight, Velgrind is preparing in case of an unforeseen situation.</p><br/><p>Looking at that, Velzard judged that it would better to leave it to Velgrind in case anything happened.</p><br/><p>The problem was Velda.</p><br/><p>As one would expect of Chloe, she was cautious and devoted herself to a wait-and-see approach. Carefully and calmly, she seemed to be measuring Velda\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Milim was reckless as she kept repeating her suicidal attacks.</p><br/><p>Velzard was helping Milim with defense by putting up her shield to prevent the attacks towards Milim, but she would still accumulate some damage.</p><br/><p>Although Milim didn\u2019t look like she was holding back, she appeared weaker compared to when she fought Guy a long time ago.</p><br/><p>Velzard doubted it.</p><br/><p>\u300cMilim, you\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMILIM, YOU FOOL! YOU BETTER GET SERIOUS!\u300d</p><br/><p>When Velzard tried to say her doubt, Guy shouted as if he lost his temper.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Milim rebutted seemingly unamused.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m going full power! I didn\u2019t hold back, you know!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIdiot. You were stronger a long time ago, you know!? You aren\u2019t using\u300eWrathful Lord Satanael\u300f, right!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUgh!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Having been pointed out by Guy, Milim\u2019s sight went all over the place for an instant as if to express \u201cI forgot!\u201d.</p><br/><p>However, if she were to elude the question, it would hurt her dignity,</p><br/><p>\u300cBu-but! I might not be able to control myself with it. Last time, you and Ramiris \u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJeez! Just do it! Even I have my hands full with this guy as my opponent, you know!? Just hurry up and send that damn bastard flying!\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy urged Milim with partly desperate tone.</p><br/><p>In fact, both Guy and Rudra\u2019s strength were nearly equal and Guy didn\u2019t have the leeway to talk with Milim.</p><br/><p>He could only tell Milim that much and turned towards Rudra.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry to keep you waiting\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat, it\u2019s fine. It will be boring unless we fight seriously after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy stated his thanks to Rudra who was holding back while Guy was advising Milim.</p><br/><p>Rudra magnanimously nodded.</p><br/><p>Then, they both struck their swords at the same time and scattered intense sparks.</p><br/><p>Velzard sighed after she watched the two in amazement and felt her doubt was cleared.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that Milim hadn\u2019t gotten serious; she just didn\u2019t use her Ultimate Skill.</p><br/><p>However, Milim\u2019s words were also correct.</p><br/><p>A\u300eMagic Essence Breeder Reactor[7]\u300fthat was so strong that Milim couldn\u2019t master it; that was\u300eWrathful Lord Satanael\u300f\u2019s true identity.</p><br/><p>The ultimate power which increased her magic essences steadily by using her intense anger and magic essences as fuel.</p><br/><p>The magic essences used as fuel were used and restored[8] to become even more power. It was literally multiplied.</p><br/><p>As long as this was activated, Milim\u2019s energy[9] would increase immediately. Furthermore, it wouldn\u2019t decrease even if she kept using it, it was certainly the ultimate ability.</p><br/><p>The one who controls infinite power, that is the demon lord named Milim.</p><br/><p>Her title as the child of Veldanava was not just for show.</p><br/><p>However, Milim had never activated\u300eWrathful Lord Satanael\u300fat all.</p><br/><p>It was only after Guy had succeeded in reproducing the ability when they fought long ago that Milim realized it.</p><br/><p>Although Guy had succeeded in reproducing\u300eWrathful Lord Satanael\u300fwith his\u300ePrideful Lord Lucifer\u300f, he gave up in letting such an extremely powerful ability to stay active all the time. He could keep it permanently active at about 40% and using his remaining capacities to utilize other abilities. And, even if he activated the ability in full power while maintaining his ego, the limit would be about 90% from a self-analysis he had done.</p><br/><p>However, if it is Milim\u2015\u2015it\u2019s an unparalleled powerful ability but if it\u2019s Milim she can control it\u2015\u2015 such is Guy's confidence in her.</p><br/><p>And, Velzard too remembered the story she previously heard from Guy when she saw the current Milim.</p><br/><p>Milim didn\u2019t need to use Ultimate Skill because she possessed enormous energy surpassing awakened demon lord.</p><br/><p>If Milim could activate\u300eWrathful Lord Satanael\u300f, Velzard thought that she couldn\u2019t imagine how high her strength would rise.</p><br/><p>(Perhaps, she might be able to embody a strength exceeding even us the \u201cTrue Dragons\u201d \u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>She came to realize the threat.</p><br/><p>However, she thought that it was necessary to defeat Velda in front of her. Besides, if it was Milim, she believed that Milim could control\u300eWrathful Lord Satanael\u300fcompletely with her strong will.</p><br/><p>As for Milim\u2015\u2015 despite having intense conflicts, she understood that her current strength didn\u2019t reach Velda\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she made the decision to pour her rage into\u300eWrathful Lord Satanael\u300f.</p><br/><p>As if he sensed the sign from Milim,</p><br/><p>\u300cRudra, there\u2019s no time to play around, hurry up and finish it!\u300d</p><br/><p>So, Velda shouted.</p><br/><p>However, the answer was\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up, my opponent isn\u2019t so weak that I can win by going half-assed! You should understand that if you are my master! For you to say such foolish words, it seems you are not my master as I expected. However, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m grateful that you gave me the chance to settle my fight with Guy. So, be quiet. I will do my best to thank you for that. If you understand, then don\u2019t order me around!\u300d</p><br/><p>Rudra straightforwardly rebuked Velda.</p><br/><p>There was only the matter to settle his fight with Guy in Rudra\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>He was now enjoying his fight with Guy from the bottom of his heart and felt that Velda\u2019s words were nothing more than a hindrance.</p><br/><p>Milim\u2019s voice echoed when Velda frowned due to Rudra\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry to keep you waiting. This time, I\u2019ll go all out for sure!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim stood with bluish-white patterns that looked like dragon scales having emerged on her whole body.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Enormous amount of aura gushed out from her body which was neatly circulated and formed a defensive membrane to cope with every kind of attacks.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Princess[10] Milim Nava had now unleashed her true power.</p><br/><p>[1]  Guntou, Military Sword.

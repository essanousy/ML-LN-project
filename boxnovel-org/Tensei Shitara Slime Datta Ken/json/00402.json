I came this far, after all. And I intend to go until the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>All at once, things became very noisy again.</p><br/><p>I would have to make them all calm down once, so they could listen to what I had to say.</p><br/><p>While\nthe immediate danger was gone, the root of the problem had not been\nsolved yet. To be precise, while the world had not been destroyed, the\nplanet was still dying.</p><br/><p>I opened my mouth to say something, but it turned out that there was no need.</p><br/><p>Michelle had opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d</p><br/><p>A shout.</p><br/><p>That\nwas all. Those who had been talking about a plan, in which their lives\nwould be at risk, now closed their mouths and looked at Michelle with\nexpressions of shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichelle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Michelle. Did you succeed in controlling it? But, how did you reconnect your \u2018brain\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\nthat\u2019s impossible! Even after regaining control of your body, it would\nstill be impossible to stop the energy in your state!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Michelle, according to my partner, you are currently in a stable position. But are you really okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Questions that were full of disbelief were being thrown around.</p><br/><p>It was no surprise.</p><br/><p>The problem had been solved so quickly that it was hard to believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you all have a lot you want to say, but wait. I must thank my saviour first!\u201d</p><br/><p>With these words, the others seemed to regain their calm a little.</p><br/><p>And then their gazes turned to Veldora and then me.</p><br/><p>Boing.</p><br/><p>A light blue sphere\u2014well, more of an ellipse\u2014creature.</p><br/><p>And even I knew that my appearance was suspicious.</p><br/><p>However, Michelle looked straight at me.</p><br/><p>And then she said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s you that saved me and this world? You have my thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amazingly, this Michelle person seemed to understand what had happened while time had stood still.</p><br/><p>Perhaps she had grown mentally when her \u2018brain\u2019 was cut off from her body?</p><br/><p>Either\nthat, or it was an effect of the special substances birthed from the\nMobius System. Apparently, Veldora had not been able to use \u2018Appraisal\u2019\ndue to outside disturbances. The Mobius System was so mysterious that it\nwas no wonder Master Ciel had an interest in it.</p><br/><p>In any case, this would make things easier.</p><br/><p>Michelle\nseemed like a leader here. She had that sense of authority that allowed\nher to dominate the others. And it would make it easier for me to talk\nif someone in her position was able to understand things.</p><br/><p>I intended to negotiate about the future in detail.</p><br/><p>With this thought in mind, I transformed into a human as a show of politeness.</p><br/><p>I felt more relaxed as a slime, but it was hard to look people in the eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. I am Rimuru. It seems like my comrades have caused you a lot of trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Michelle. They haven\u2019t caused any trouble at all. It was I who asked for their aid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michelle answered back. She sounded a little nervous.</p><br/><p>Next\nto me, Veldora was mumbling. \u2018Don\u2019t use such lukewarm words. Introduce\nme as a sworn brother!\u2019 I would definitely bee ignoring him.</p><br/><p>Regardless, he was clearly going to leave everything to me. So I left him and looked around the room.</p><br/><p>Before I knew it, a hushed silence had fallen over the place.</p><br/><p>And their eyes were piercing into me.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t they realize how uncomfortable it made me?</p><br/><p>I wondered, but I couldn\u2019t just say goodbye and leave now.</p><br/><p>There were still problems left to solve.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow,\nI\u2019m sure you all have different opinions, but surely you agree that\nthis chaos must be stopped? I want to discuss the future. Is that all\nright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora and the others had sided with the Resistance.</p><br/><p>That meant they had gone against the Empire, and yet, they were also somehow allies with Michelle.</p><br/><p>In other words, things were not so simple. There was a lot happening behind the scenes.</p><br/><p>And as things had escalated so far, it seemed like the proper thing to do was to make everything clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf\ncourse. And I would like the leaders of the resistance to hear as well.\nThere is no point in hiding anything now. It will expose the Empire\u2019s\nshame\u2026but this is not the time to worry over such things\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Michelle said. Then she smiled with an insightful look.</p><br/><p>She accepted my suggestion and began to talk about the hidden truth.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Tribes\nwarring, language barriers, economic disparities, religious\ndifferences. In view of all of these things, my father, Almsbine,\ndecided who would become residents of the city. It was all a gamble for\nthe survival of our species. I still feel that it is meaningless to\nargue about good and evil in this case. After all, our civilization\nwould not exist today if he had not enacted this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michelle finished there.</p><br/><p>That was the full story of the project.</p><br/><p>Of course, you could try to persuade those who had been cut off and abandoned, but you were not likely to make them understand.</p><br/><p>But an administrator had to make decisions. She said.</p><br/><p>They\nwould have talked if things could be resolved that way. However, when\none side profited while the other suffered, there was nothing you could\ndo to reach a consensus.</p><br/><p>And if that happened, they would run out of resources while discussions ran on. Mankind would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>But, even then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough, Michelle. Even after that, there was no future for us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I man muttered quietly. He was sitting on the ground and looked exhausted.</p><br/><p>And yet the voice rang around the room, and everyone heard him clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFudora\u2026what are you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019s called Fudora, huh?</p><br/><p>He was the man who had been fighting the raging gravity waves next to Michelle until the end.</p><br/><p>Appearance-wise, Fudora was a young man. And yet he seemed aged, somehow.</p><br/><p>The voice was just as tired. But he spoke so that everyone could hear him, not just Michelle.</p><br/><p>It was full of despair, and yet it was an accurate analysis of the current situation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I would even probably throw up if Diablo-sama were to intimidate me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being called in, two beings walked in.</p><br/><p>A man, having a laugh at Souei\u2019s mistake, and a young lady, deeming it inevitable.</p><br/><p>It was Laplace and Tia.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up. Diablo joining was also part of the plan. We don\u2019t have time. Let\u2019s get this program together.\u201d</p><div></div><br/><p>Souei casually made it so that it looks like he didn\u2019t make a mistake and Diablo joining in was part of the plan from the start.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha?! Souei-han, glossing over your mistake lik-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSouei-sama said \u2018shut up\u2019, didn\u2019t you hear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Souka said, holding a kunai to Laplace\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Laplace, now having cold sweat, laughed and closed his mouth.</p><br/><p>Completely ignoring all that, Souei began explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true, as you have predicted, I have received a secret mission from Rimuru-sama. And that mission is-\u201d</p><br/><p>Souei told Diablo everything about the mission he received from Rimuru without hiding anything.</p><br/><p>He was thinking that he would need reliable p.a.w.ns either way.</p><br/><p>The most important part of the mission was to not let Shion, Shuna, and even Milim know of his whereabouts or his movements.</p><br/><p>Although Shion and Shuna were already distracted by the body he left behind, Milim might come down from the sky to play like she does sometimes.</p><br/><p>Souei explained that Rimuru was worrying that if Milim was to find out about this when she comes, she might spoil everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s that Milim-sama\u2026\u2026 If she were to know that we are hiding something\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. That is certainly true. So that\u2019s why he went so far to not leave any traces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo and Laplace understood.</p><br/><p>With that as the base, the group began discussing on how to progress with the mission.</p><br/><p>The mission objectives were the following:</p><br/><p>First, kidnapping only the students riding on the plane as Rimuru and take them to the Maldolando island.</p><br/><p>There, they would release all of them and reform them thoroughly with actual battles.</p><br/><p>Second, investigation on each academy\u2019s corruption.</p><br/><p>The main point of this part was to confirm if there was anything wrong with the academies which might be the source of the students\u2019 corruption. And upon confirming that, he also said to inform Ingracia that the students will be a week late.</p><br/><p>There was a need to proceed with these two simultaneously.</p><br/><p>And the problem was that the plane Rimuru was on had already taken flight.</p><br/><p>It was a battle against time-to not only catch up to this plane, but to also bring along a plane which could take in all the students.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaplace, do you understand why I called you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha?! Don\u2019t tell me you plan on using my air pirate ship-?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else is there? You were bragging about it happily before, weren\u2019t you? Use it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laplace became pale.</p><br/><p>It seems this air pirate ship was quite important to Laplace.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, what is this air pirate ship?\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo asked Laplace as he was curious.</p><br/><p>And immediately, as if he had regained his spirit, Laplace began explaining happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you intrigued? Actually, I made it with the parts Rimuru-sama created, with my refined knowledge! I also had a battle with Benimaru-han\u2019s ship the other day and it ended in my overwhelming victory, ya know? Rimuru-sama had said that he would increase the speed by three times if I dye it red so I did that half in doubt but doing that was the correct move! Moreover, I also used the chip from Rimuru-sama which I received as reward for the underworld job and got a high speed autocannon! And its majesty, man! It is definitely what you would call an air pirate ship. I am planning on installing electromagnetic weapons next but this needs optics weapons which can produce high output heat-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laplace was bragging on about his ship but Diablo stopped him.</p><br/><p>There were many points to be concerned about but there was no time to be spent on Laplace at the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like there are quite a few things I should be concerned about right now but did you just say that Rimuru-sama was also involved in this air pirate ship thing you made?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, now\u2019s not the time for that, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s important, Souei. This chip point you used-you can get stuff like that from it? And Benimaru-dono is also in this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes? There\u2019s also Gabil-han and Gerudo-han. If n.o.body wants the object within a certain amount of time, the one who goes to ask for it the quickest and if more than one person wants it, then they have to bid on it. It\u2019s the most popular hobby these days! Gerudo-han is starting by polishing his keel-that man is an expert. And-\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Laplace as he happily kept going on, Diablo turned around to face Souei.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know of this, Souei?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did know that they were doing something but\u2026\u2026 to think it had spread that much\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Souei was not amused.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and I, the people who are supposed to be most knowledgeable about Rimuru-sambut it seems like we still have ways to go. Well, that\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s leave that aside for now and move on with the mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. I shall investigate this properly once we are done with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, I would like an explanation as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Diablo and Souei nodded and moved forward with the plan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

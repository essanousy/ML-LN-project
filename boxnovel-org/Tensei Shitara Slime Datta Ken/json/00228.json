A knockout competition? Let\u2019s fight one by one and decide the outcome. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Dino, this was his last resort.</p><br/><p>Being told by Zero to buy them some time, he had to be persistent somehow.</p><br/><p>If a fight breaks out in this situation, in 8 or 9 cases out of 10, it will end in Dino\u2019s defeat.</p><br/><p>rather, if one were to speak of Dino individually, he probably wouldn\u2019t last a few minutes.</p><br/><p>(This isn\u2019t funny at all. If those two are my opponent, I won\u2019t even be able to achieve my biggest goal, to stay alive\u2026)</p><br/><p>He had to have his way here some way or the other\u2013that was what Dino thought.</p><br/><p>If they were to fight one by one, it would buy him time and moreover, if things go well for him, Zero\u2019s preparations will be done by the time his turn comes up.</p><br/><p>(But even still, nobody would listen to an insect like me normally. After all, it would be too convenient for me\u2014)</p><br/><p>Dino thought that it would be impossible after all but\u2026</p><br/><p>[Yep, okay! That is better for us too so\u2014]</p><br/><p>[Oi!]</p><br/><p>[Oops! Ignore that. It\u2019s nothing worth thinking about! And so, I, Gabil, will be going first then~!]</p><br/><p>Benimaru and Ramiris were having a questionable conversation.</p><br/><p>Looks like the other party was also looking to buy time but even then, the situation was favorable for Dino.</p><br/><p>(So far so good! Looks like luck is on my side!)</p><br/><p>And like this, without even inquiring into Ramiris\u2019 conversation, he was honestly happy that his suggestion was accepted.</p><br/><p>And as such, the fight had started in the form of pro wrestling.</p><br/><p>The first two to fight were Gabil and Pico.</p><br/><p>The fight had turned into an aerial one as the two moved about in three dimensions.</p><br/><p>Their weapons also resembled closely, being spears, and the fight was going on well.</p><br/><p>(Wait a minute, this guy\u2026 his abilities have increased abnormally, haven\u2019t they?!)</p><br/><p>Pico was astonished deep down.</p><br/><p>Compared to when they had a bout before, he had gotten so tough that it felt as if it was a different person.</p><br/><p>His abilities were drawing near that of Pico\u2019s \u2014 close to that of an awakened demon king level.</p><br/><p>Although she had her doubts, Pico properly gauged the situation. And like that, they went on intensely fighting mid air for a while.</p><br/><p>Pico had confirmed Gabil\u2019s growth and wasn\u2019t underestimating him anymore as someone below her.</p><br/><p>After a while into testing each other\u2019s strength, it looked like they decided to go all out.</p><br/><p>Both Gabil\u2019s Black flames breath: Flame Breath and Black thunder breath: Thunder Breath didn\u2019t work against Pico. Neither did Pico\u2019s Black thunder heavenbreak: Black Thunder and Divine victory punishment: Heaven\u2019s judgement work against Gabil.</p><br/><p>Pico\u2019s Divine victory punishment: Heaven\u2019s judgement is actually a very troublesome ability, inflicting all the damage the user has done to their previous opponents to the target. However, Gabil sealed that ability using his Ultimate Gift: Pierrot Star (The Frivolous)\u2019s Rewrite Fate.</p><br/><p>Even Pico couldn\u2019t hide her surprise anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-! Are you kidding me?! Why don\u2019t you die? This is ridiculous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRude!! Are you that discontent with me not dying? But, I also have my reasons for which I can\u2019t afford to lose. Forgive me, little girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he had gone and said that, inside, Gabil was dripping with sweat.</p><br/><p>After all, he had suddenly used his trump card, Rewrite Fate.</p><br/><p>Judging from the fact that that ability, which automatically negates any kind of damage and can only be used once a day, had activated automatically means he would have definitely died from that attack.</p><br/><p>If she were to use that ability once again, it would definitely result in Gabil losing his life.</p><br/><p>However, Pico was also in a state of confusion.</p><br/><p>Pico was being wary of Gabil and had used her strongest attack, as well.</p><br/><p>(That guy\u2026 it is ominous how he still looks to have that much leeway. He stayed composed while getting hit by my attack and it doesn\u2019t seem like he took any damage. This is troubling, if that didn\u2019t work, I don\u2019t really have a decisive attack anymore\u2014)</p><br/><p>And well, like that, she was also troubled inside.</p><br/><p>But in reality, Pico did have spare energy but as long as none of her attacks work, the fight will have to be decided by close range combat.</p><br/><p>She thought that if it comes to that, it would take up too much time.</p><br/><p>If that happens, no matter how much Dino is making a gamble to buy time, the recovery won\u2019t be able to make it in time \u2014 Pico concluded.</p><br/><p>This is the enemy\u2019s territory \u2014 although they were having a one on one, the situation wasn\u2019t equal.</p><br/><p>As long as Pico and the others don\u2019t have more reserve strength, it wouldn\u2019t mean a thing even if they were to win. It would be dangerous to consume it all here.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no guarantee Ramiris and the others will hold their end of the promise and there\u2019s also a substitute on standby at the back.</p><br/><p>She also thought of the possibility that if she were to go all out poorly, she might also be done in immediately by some hidden enemy.</p><br/><p>(It was reckless to attack with just us 3 in the first place! Dino can\u2019t be relied on either\u2014)</p><br/><p>She glanced at her ally, Dino, but maybe because it wasn\u2019t his turn yet, Dino was relaxing while watching them.</p><br/><p>(That idiot, he really thinks it is not his matter!)</p><br/><p>Anger filled Pico\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>From the start, it would be fine if they were just able to buy some time for Zero. Thinking that, Pico abandoned thinking of the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will decide this with my next move!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how I would want it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how both of them didn\u2019t have any flexibility, both decided on settling the fight with their hidden techniques.</p><br/><p>\u201cFallen angel final spear: Fallen Spear!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue \u2013 dragon whirlwind spear: Dragonic Vortex!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two clashed.</p><br/><p>And at an instance, got blown away.</p><br/><p>As if to demonstrate the destructiveness of those powers, both of them were hurled back and crashed into the ground, without even being able to defend themselves.</p><br/><p>[Alright, over! And the result is, dra-w~!]</p><br/><p>And with Ramiris\u2019 announcement, the first battle was over.</p><br/><p>The result was a draw but it seems like there was a big difference in the breakdown.</p><br/><p>Gabil had wounds all over his body and was unable to continue the fight.</p><br/><p>In contrast, Pico was only pretending to have taken huge damage.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.Oi. What, did you hold back at the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you could tell? Well, after all, if I don\u2019t leave some strength for later, I can\u2019t escape from here, can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Looks like you have realized my objective, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? You\u2026 how long do you think we have been together? I can see straight through you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkkay, okkay. Then it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s stupid hanging out with Zero\u2019s suicidal plan so we will escape with the opportunity so keep your eyes open.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it~! It also looks like Gracia has noticed so she will probably buy some time too against that tough guy, I think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? That would help. To be honest, my opponent is really no joke. That Zegion dude is seriously bad news\u2026 Really, I want to just escape right this moment, you know? That guy probably won\u2019t get a joke either\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-well, do your best, I guess? It depends on how hard Gracia tries, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a conversation was taking place between Dino and Pico while Gracia was making her way to the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Pico ended the fight with energy to spare.</p><br/><p>Dino also believed that was for the best.</p><br/><p>Dino was also wondering if it was okay put trust on Zero.</p><br/><p>In this situation, it could be said that Pico\u2019s choice was correct.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, you probably can\u2019t be at ease but rest for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take you up on that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pico started resting and Dino looked towards Gracia.</p><br/><p>Letting out a sigh, Dino concentrated on the next battle.</p><br/><p>The second fight was between Gerudo and Gracia.</p><br/><p>As this was a battle between two parties excelling in defense, it wouldn\u2019t be as flashy but it will surely turn out to be a fight between experts with solid ability.</p><br/><p>Against Gerudo\u2019s Meat Crusher and Huge Shield, Gracia was equipped with an orthodox longsword and a round shield.</p><br/><p>After having evolved, Gerudo\u2019s abilities to fight individually had also gone up.</p><br/><p>Although he has his eyes set mostly on defense, he has quite some offensive abilities as well.</p><br/><p>However, as there was a need to gather up strength for a while to use it, it wouldn\u2019t hit Gracia.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Gerudo\u2019s Ultimate Skill: Gourmet King Beelzebub is an army scale ability.</p><br/><p>It is on the complete opposite side of individual skills \u2014 it is an ability to raise the standards of his allies.</p><br/><p>And as such, it became equal to Gracia\u2019s all purpose type defensive ability.</p><br/><p>Compared to Pico, Gracia had a good balance of offense.</p><br/><p>On top of equal defensive skill, she had stronger offensive skills than Gerudo. It was supposed to be Gracia\u2019s unrivaled battlefield of overwhelming advantage.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, blocking every single one of my attacks. I can\u2019t be underestimating\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, I am someone who has received the title of Barrier Lord from Rimuru-sama. Know that you will not be able to go past my defense.\u201d</p><br/><p>With masterful abilities, Gerudo beautifully blocked Gracia\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>And that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>In contrast to Gracia, who was supposed to be excelling in offense, Gerudo\u2019s attacks were gradually accumulating damage to Gracia.</p><br/><p>Having lived for a long time, Gracia had built up a mountain\u2019s worth of experience but when speaking of the density of this experience, Gerudo was also not losing.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t quite stand out in Tempest, Gerudo had never slacked off and always trained his skills. His abilities had now reached the top-tier.</p><br/><p>To the point he could rival Albert in terms of defense.</p><br/><p>And, even his attacks, comprising of big movements and weak spots, were also traps to lure in the enemy.</p><br/><p>As expected of Gracia, she had seen through that and didn\u2019t try to attack carelessly.</p><br/><p>(I was thinking of buying some time but\u2026 This, I don\u2019t think I have the leeway to be holding back anymore.)</p><br/><p>Gracia praised Gerudo on the inside.</p><br/><p>And just like Gracia had predicted, the battle turned into a deadlock naturally and slowly became plain\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>As mentioned above, their fight was truly wonderful from the eyes of an expert.</p><br/><p>However, from the perspective of an amateur, it was extremely boring.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am already tired of this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A small child muttered selfishly in the control room.</p><br/><p>Gerudo and Gracia\u2019s fight was truly simple, without any ultimate moves or magic.</p><br/><p>It was nothing near interesting to a child, who couldn\u2019t read the level of skill between the two experts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s just call this a draw and start the next match? Isn\u2019t it time to torment Dino a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid?! Don\u2019t you also need to buy time, Ramiris-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>Benimaru retorted to Ramiris\u2019 foolish idea.</p><br/><p>Seems like it was starting to become a pain for Benimaru to use honorifics against Ramiris as his tone was starting to sound quite vague.</p><br/><p>He was quite a bit vague from the start but it seems like he doesn\u2019t even care now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, vice commander?! I need you to call me the best commander! \u2026But yea, I guess you have a point. Well then, I don\u2019t mind, let them continue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, and then? How does the progress rate look now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, let\u2019s see, the progress has crossed 90%. In just a bit, our preparations will be complete. And his encroachment seems to be at 70%. \u2018Cause we started preparing after having Rimuru think, we will easily reach our goal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s good. Then, we just need to wait a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Benimaru and Ramiris nodded at each other.</p><br/><p>As Ramiris looked satisfied, Benimaru turned to face the screen again.</p><br/><p>Benimaru was thinking it was preposterous to stop this fight.</p><br/><p>Gabil\u2019s fight just now was so disappointing that Hakurou and Agera even said that it\u2019s confirmed that he must go through training once again. But, Gerudo\u2019s fighting style was wonderful.</p><br/><p>Benimaru, unlike Ramiris, liked this kind of fights between experts and was entranced by it.</p><br/><p>It seems like Gracia was above in terms of ability but Gerudo\u2019s strenuous efforts to fill in that gap was amazing.</p><br/><p>And thus, the tension of the fight had reached the climax\u2013</p><br/><p>The end was near.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Gerudo and Gracia kept clashing intensely with their weapons.</p><br/><p>The momentum had accelerated and the fight was not even close to being plain anymore.</p><br/><p>Due to the heat caused by the reciprocation of overwhelmingly strong strikes, with each stroke of sword, the ground teared up and the atmosphere turned chaotic, creating large gusts of wind.</p><br/><p>Captivating everyone watching, the two continued their fight as if they were dancing.</p><br/><p>And then came a moment of silence.</p><br/><p>Everyone present there thought that the next attack will be deciding the fate of the battle.</p><br/><p>However\u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, that withdrawal was an act, huh? I didn\u2019t think an attack like that would be able to go past your defense but\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. I didn\u2019t have that much of a leeway but your attack wasn\u2019t that strong to make me withdraw. Besides \u2014 we won\u2019t withdraw without orders. Everything will be as Rimuru-sama wills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFu. So I was the one being cornered, eh? Looks like I had lost before the fight even began. Very well. I have lost this time. I want to withdraw here, will you accept?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing facing each other, Gracia offered to forfeit.</p><br/><p>Gerudo became perplexed, as it was unexpected to him.</p><br/><p>[Okkay~! Then, the winner is Gerudo~! Now, Dino, come out! I haven\u2019t forgotten your poor behavior towards me the other time. Now it\u2019s my turn to thoroughly crush you!]</p><br/><p>Without paying any heed to Gerudo, Ramiris\u2019 heavenly voice declared the result of the battle.</p><br/><p>Although it seemed like Ramiris\u2019 personal desires had mixed with the announcement there but the decision had been made.</p><br/><p>It was a godsend for Ramiris, as she was bored but Benimaru was disappointed.</p><br/><p>Seems like Benimaru also doesn\u2019t have any complaints since the other party declared their withdrawal themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that okay\u2026? I felt like you didn\u2019t quite go all out yet, though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. You have also just evolved and don\u2019t seem like you can perfectly use those abilities yet. I would like to decide once and for all at a place both of us can truly go all out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gerudo and Gracia exchanged glances and smiled at each other.</p><br/><p>And like this, the second battle had also come to an end.</p><br/><p>As she returned to Dino, Gracia muttured,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad, Dino. That guy has also become absurdly strong. I would\u2019ve had trouble even if I went all out, no doubt. I probably wouldn\u2019t have lost if I went all out but I would have exhausted all my energy and would have not been able to participate in any more battles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? As there seems to be more strong ones here, exhausting all of your energy is the same as suicide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPico is right. You also be careful, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, got it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Dino advanced forward.</p><br/><p>However, his steps felt heavy.</p><br/><p>(Or rather, isn\u2019t Ramiris just aiming for me here? Telling me to not exhaust all my energy \u2014 it isn\u2019t like I will be doing that \u2018cause I want to. I am also reluctantly going to fight\u2026 Alright, while fighting Gerudo, I should buy some time slowly\u2026)</p><br/><p>[Ah, Gerudo. You\u2019re tired, right? You can withdraw!]</p><br/><p>Dino was thinking of something unfair but looks like Ramiris had beat him to the punch.</p><br/><p>Gerudo meekly decided to withdraw and tapped out with Zegion and Beretta.</p><br/><p>(Darn it all! You saw through my plan!?)</p><br/><p>Although he was complaining in his heart, he couldn\u2019t do anything about this situation.</p><br/><p>The enemy were Beretta and Zegion.</p><br/><p>To be completely honest, they weren\u2019t some enemy Dino could win against.</p><br/><p>There, he suddenly thought up a plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right! I will also withdraw\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2018Buzzzzz!\u2019 Rejected!!]</p><br/><p>However, that plan was flatly rejected by Ramiris.</p><br/><p>Having the look of a dead man, Dino faced Zegion and Beretta.</p><br/><p>And then suddenly, a small doubt came to his mind.</p><br/><p>(Hmm? Did that Zegion guy have that little energy?)</p><br/><p>Dino could grasp that change, as he had fought him once before.</p><br/><p>However, Dino didn\u2019t have the time to be thinking about such a thing.</p><br/><p>The time of his fate which he had been trying to prolong had announced its beginning.</p><br/><p>(Darn it! That Zero. Hurry up! You can\u2019t come complaining to me if you don\u2019t make it in time!!)</p><br/><p>Or rather, it would be Dino who will be in trouble if Zero doesn\u2019t make it, though\u2026</p><br/><p>Letting out a sigh, Dino reluctantly took his stance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

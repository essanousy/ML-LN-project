I stopped time[1], so I was safe, since I escaped right away, but Diablo was in a terrible situation since he lost half of his body.</p><br/><p>Oh dear, he\u2019s acting as if he\u2019s dying, what should I do with him, geez\u2026</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t make fun of Milim ever again, I now see her in a new light.</p><br/><p>But as the result, Milim made herself more trustworthy towards Lucia.</p><br/><p>Milim shot a Dragon Nova and killed the body which was pretending to be me, and retrieved it to Lucia. Then, in order to make her think that I\u2019m dead, I canceled \u201cEternal Pain\u201d which had ensnared Lucia.</p><br/><p>In that way, Milim succeeded in making Lucia trust her as well as infiltrate into the enemy\u2019s stronghold.</p><br/><p>As I hid myself, waiting for Milim\u2019s signal, I slipped into the darkness with teleport.</p><br/><p>Well then, while staying somewhere calm, I begin to think about various things.</p><br/><p>The first is the change in Ciel that I felt a while ago.</p><br/><p>About \u201cEternal pain\u201d too, but I believe that Ciel\u2019s ability has increased greatly.</p><br/><p>Yet, I\u2019m more bothered about my miscalculations on Gobuta\u2019s growth limit.</p><br/><p>(Hey, don\u2019t you think that Gobuta\u2019s rapid growth is a bit abnormal?</p><br/><p>How much has he surpassed your calculations? And, isn\u2019t the calculation deviation too extreme?)</p><br/><p>That is the what I\u2019m worried about.</p><br/><p>Because up till recently, at the time when I still called her Raphael-sensei, it was rare for her predictions go awry.</p><br/><p>I mean, as far as I remember, the only mistake in Raphael-sensei\u2019s calculations was the nature of Veldora\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>And yet, she incorrectly predicted Gobuta\u2019s growth speed, isn\u2019t this disappointing coming from Ciel? No matter how much of a genius Gobuta is, I wasn\u2019t convinced at all.</p><br/><p>Because I was so doubtful, I asked Ciel but,</p><br/><p>\u300aThat is\u2026\u2026whilst performing the calculation, deeper information was detected\u2026\u2026 as a result, a large deviation has occurred.\u300b</p><br/><p>So I was informed.</p><br/><p>In other words, since Gobuta\u2019s ability increased so much, conversely the accuracy fell huh.</p><br/><p>No, rather than that\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t the fluctuation happening due to the appearance of her emotions?</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015The idea flashed in my mind.</p><br/><p>This might not be a good example, but just like when taking a test, the more you check your answer, the more you question yourself.</p><br/><p>It is often the case that the first answer will be the correct one.</p><br/><p>In other words, what Ciel is feeling is none other than the emotion called \u201cAnxiety\u201d.</p><br/><p>A human is a creature who makes mistakes.</p><br/><p>Why is that?</p><br/><p>It is because a human is an emotional creature.</p><br/><p>Machines never make mistakes. Because they never feel anxiety.</p><br/><p>If a machine makes a mistake, the cause may be that there was an error during the input of the data or the machine is broken.</p><br/><p>As Ciel evolved, she obtained \u201cEmotions\u201d.</p><br/><p>It means that a perfect being has fallen into an imperfect state.</p><br/><p>Experiencing anxiety, she wavers, and so she made a mistake.</p><br/><p>Is this a degeneration?</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>This\u2019s unmistakably, an evolution.</p><br/><p>Ciel, despite being an existence that had reached perfection, wished for emotions.</p><br/><p>A baby feels they\u2019re almighty whilst inside their mother\u2019s womb, but they lose that feeling as soon as they are born.</p><br/><p>Thus, they feel insecure and cry.</p><br/><p>Ciel is the same as the newborn baby.</p><br/><p>From a perfect situation, like a perfect sphere, she had been transferred into a bigger container.</p><br/><p>The vessel was so big, that her own existence became indeterminate.</p><br/><p>Therefore, to fill that container, a large surge of emotion was produced.</p><br/><p>But I feel relieved because that container, is me.</p><br/><p>The chipped container for her indeterminate form is my soul. And, because Ciel was born inside of me, my heart is stable.</p><br/><p>The emotions are like waves, they fill the cracks of my heart and become small.</p><br/><p>Ciel was bewildered as she hadn\u2019t produced a wave of emotion before, so it might take time before she becomes used to it, as for me, my uneasiness became tiny as my heart was filled.</p><br/><p>In other words, Ciel felt the anxiety in my place.</p><br/><p> (It is not a problem, so don\u2019t worry about it. Have confidence in yourself!</p><br/><p>You keep on analyzing even while in that state, if it\u2019s you I\u2019m sure you can arrive at the correct answer.</p><br/><p>Therefore, believe it.</p><br/><p>We complement each other, you\u2019re not alone!)</p><br/><p>\u300aMaster\u2015\u2015\u300b</p><br/><p>Ciel remained silent to my words.</p><br/><p>However, the waves of emotion became calm as my chipped heart was filled.</p><br/><p>Then, Ciel also calmed down as her anxiety changed into relief.</p><br/><p>\u300aYes, my lord! Everything will follow your heart\u2019s desires!\u300b</p><br/><p>Ciel properly understood my words.</p><br/><p>And while hiding under the cover of darkness, she will be reflecting on her meaning of life.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>Velgrind flew into the sky with speed that holds up to the title of fastest. Her body feels light and her power seems to have increased.</p><br/><p>With a heavy heart, and a mind that is tangled she thought to herself.</p><br/><p>In the first place, what the hell is that person?</p><br/><p>She, who is one of the strongest, a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d, was unable to so much as scratch him.</p><br/><p>An individual with a soul compatible with the dragon\u2019s element and a body that is comparable to the \u201cTrue Dragons\u201d that stand at the summit of this world.</p><br/><p>And that individual, possessing such enormous energy, stood firmly while being capable of absorbing a \u201cTrue Dragon\u201d.</p><br/><p>Moreover, two of them.</p><br/><p>Can such a being exist?</p><br/><p>No, it must exist. It is undeniable that such a being exists.</p><br/><p>However, for it to be a Unique Monster who was born from a collection of magic essences leaked from Veldora, by chance, is impossible.</p><br/><p>Even if she looked at herself right now, compared to before, her condition is more optimized and in better shape.</p><br/><p>She has a feeling that her energy levels has somehow increased.</p><br/><p>So in other words, that slime, who manifested her, has a container that simply surpasses the total amount of her energy.</p><br/><p>(I can\u2019t believe it. Such a being\u2026\u2026 as far as I know, there\u2019s only one\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>She continued thinking.</p><br/><p>While continuing to fly around the continent at high speed.</p><br/><p>Her speed reached a dozen times the speed of sound and became a flying object which emitted extreme heat and without aiming to, blew away a flock of angels who crowded the sky.</p><br/><p>The soul corridor that bound her, was closed.</p><br/><p>There was no influence on her, that means, something happened to the person she bonded to.</p><br/><p>But, she didn\u2019t pay attention to that.</p><br/><p>(Humph. That person wouldn\u2019t be killed so easily. What is he planing now\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>So, she just fleetingly thought about it. </p><br/><p>There is no point in worrying about it.</p><br/><p>In the first place, there is no need for her to worry about it, or so she thought.</p><br/><p>She is free right now.</p><br/><p>Even though she buried it in her deepest thoughts, she was still in a fog of doubt.</p><br/><p>She has been caught in the whirlpool of her own thoughts for a while now.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>The report made the executives of Tempest shudder.</p><br/><p>On the first day of the Great War, the angels\u2019 attacks had ended and the evening had come.</p><br/><p>The monsters had even prepared for an ongoing battle, but the angels had withdrawn by the time night fell.</p><br/><p>This is because for the light attributed angels, they had an advantage under the light of the sun.</p><br/><p>As there is a need to eat, the loss of the energy is intense.</p><br/><p>For the monsters, a short time of peace is a blessing.</p><br/><p>Thus, it\u2019s the time for dinner.</p><br/><p>The report was brought by the people who returned at the time when the soldiers were taking their rest.</p><br/><p>In the control room established inside the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>The executives of Tempest, including the Guardian Lords, had gathered.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it true that Rimuru-sama disappeared?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes\u2026\u2026 that is correct.</p><br/><p>He received a direct hit of Milim-sama\u2019s Dragon Nova\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>To Benimaru\u2019s question, Testarossa responded.</p><br/><p>To that answer, silence descended to the room.</p><br/><p>Then Testarossa explained the situation in detail.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015Then, what did Diablo do? Where did that guy go?\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru asked while suppressing his anger.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015It is true that Diablo didn\u2019t participate in this meeting.</p><br/><p>There was a reason behind this.</p><br/><p>Diablo is the only subordinate who knows that Rimuru is alive.</p><br/><p>For this reason, Diablo can\u2019t explain why he failed to defend Rimuru even though he was there.</p><br/><p>Not seeing the reactions of the executives was regrettable for Diablo, although that isn\u2019t important, he\u2019s concerned with it, anyway this much is necessary to conceal Rimuru\u2019s survival.</p><br/><p>That being the case, he decided that it would be a problem if he, who had survived, participated in the conference.</p><br/><p>Anyway, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you protect Rimuru-sama?\u201d, he predicted that question would be directed at him.</p><br/><p>Diablo figured that if he was in Benimaru and Co\u2019s position, he surely wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive him even if he tore apart Rimuru\u2019s bodyguard.</p><br/><p>Because he thought so, he displayed his current state, where he had lost half of his body, to Testarossa and Co who had rushed over at the time.</p><br/><p>And whilst healing himself, he departed from the site, (in other words, escaped) leaving behind a message which said that he had left in order to observe Milim.</p><br/><p>As for the content, it was something along the lines of,\u300cI lost half of my body and thus shall not prove to be a useful combatant, I will be more useful for observing. \u300d.</p><br/><p>Testa and Co believed Diablo\u2019s explanation without any doubts, since Diablo\u2019s condition displayed that his current energy had decreased sharply.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026 No, Testarossa seemed to doubt him a little, however, she was uncertain about her doubt. Therefore, she decided to accept Diablo\u2019s reasoning.</p><br/><p>By the way, what he meant by observation was that the strategy required him to pass information from Milim to Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Thus, Diablo continued as Rimuru\u2019s guard whilst under the cover of darkness\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Testarossa let out a sigh and,</p><br/><p>\u300cDiablo is performing an infiltration operation.</p><br/><p>He expressed regret towards his inability to protect Rimuru-sama, but because he received an order he can\u2019t even commit suicide.</p><br/><p>It seems Diablo\u2019s duty is to free Milim-sama from their control.\u300d</p><br/><p>She explained the story Diablo had told them.</p><br/><p>Although Testa herself thought that it was dubious, it was also more or less coherent. Anyway, she remembered what she heard.</p><br/><p>When she was about to question him, Diablo suddenly teleported after Milim. (He\u2019s actually with Rimuru.)</p><br/><p>Even though she found it doubtful, since she had let him get away, she couldn\u2019t explain it to the others.</p><br/><p>Because she feels that she has always talked subjectively, it would only bring confusion to the surroundings if she spreads such uncertain information.</p><br/><p>Testarossa told it as it was, restraining herself from mixing her feelings into it.</p><br/><p>Silence ruled the control room.</p><br/><p>Even Gerudo and Gabil, who should have been tired due to the combat during the day, didn\u2019t open their mouths as they had serious expressions.</p><br/><p>Kumara had a dreadful pale face and was trembling.</p><br/><p>Benimaru strongly grasped his fist while suppressing his anger.</p><br/><p>Ramiris looked like she was about to cry while facing toward the floor.</p><br/><p>It might be a good thing that Shion, who has the shortest temper of them all, was absent at this time.</p><br/><p>In such a situation,</p><br/><p>\u300cIf I had come along, such a thing wouldn\u2019t have\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>The one who is usually calm, Souei, who would never become enraged in any situation, broke a desk in anger.</p><br/><p>Testarossa closed her eyes as she agreed with Souei\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>That way of thinking is common. She herself was feeling anguish as she was unable to do anything.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she can\u2019t rebut Souei\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>She only thought deeply about her own powerlessness.</p><br/><p>At that time, Zegion who had crossed his arms and kept silent moved.</p><br/><p>He stood up,</p><br/><p>\u300cFools. What are you all pointlessly worried about?</p><br/><p>Rimuru-sama cannot possibly be dead.</p><br/><p>Oh Testarossa, do you think that Diablo is a fighter whose power would drop by such a degree only because he lost half his body?</p><br/><p>Along those lines, is he a fool who would give up on avenging his master?</p><br/><p>Why don\u2019t you think that there is some kind of reason?</p><br/><p>Too childish.</p><br/><p>Why don\u2019t you notice that he is trying to deceive us?\u300d</p><br/><p>He declared as such towards those in the room.</p><br/><p>And, seeing each of their reactions, he continued talking.</p><br/><p>\u300cThink about it carefully. Then feel it.</p><br/><p>Even now we are still receiving Rimuru-sama\u2019s divine protection.</p><br/><p>The connection has been interrupted, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has disappeared.</p><br/><p>You should all calm down and deeply feel for it.</p><br/><p>All of you should be able to understand that we are being tested by Rimuru-sama.</p><br/><p>We are not weak, to the degree that we need to depend on Rimuru-sama for everything.</p><br/><p>In spite of that, if someone says that he can\u2019t do anything if Rimuru-sama is gone\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Such a weak individual should just die.</p><br/><p>Am I wrong, Benimaru-dono?\u300d</p><br/><p>Saying all of that in one breath, Zegion waited for Benimaru\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>Testarossa, who had thought what Zegion had said, had a slight smile sprout on her lips.</p><br/><p>It was not only Testarossa who felt that way. Everyone in the room agreed to Zegion\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right-ssu! There must be some kind of reason for Rimuru-sama to disappear-ssu.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no good for us to keep relying on him all the time-ssu!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCertainly, we have relied on Rimuru-sama far too much.</p><br/><p>I think we are always entrusting everything to that personage.\u300d(Gerudo)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. Even I became uneasy just because Rimuru-sama is not here.</p><br/><p>In such a state, we would be laughed at by Rimuru-sama!\u300d(Gabil)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right! Well, since I always believed in Rimuru, I was absolutely not worried at all!\u300d (Ramirirs)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! For Rimuru-sama to be defeated, that\u2019s impossible!\u300d(Kumara)</p><br/><p>Vigor returned to the room immediately.</p><br/><p>Benimaru also agreed as he saw the situation. Certainly, we all have been too dependent on the Great Demon Lord, Rimuru.</p><br/><p>If he thought back, it had been that way since they first met.</p><br/><p>For it to be pointed out by the newcomer, Zegion, Benimaru has failed as Rimuru\u2019s retainer.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry, Zegion.</p><br/><p>It is certainly as you said. We can still fight even if Rimuru-sama is not here.</p><br/><p>Rather than that\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I think we should quickly conquer this world and give it to Rimuru-sama once he returns.</p><br/><p>Surely, we are not such mere children that we cannot do anything without Rimuru-sama!</p><br/><p>Alright, we shall quickly end this war and then give this world to Rimuru-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru declared so.</p><br/><p>Whilst agreeing to it,</p><br/><p>\u300cGood grief\u2026\u2026 For me, of all other people, to lose my composure\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>As someone who governs the shadows, I still have a long way to go.</p><br/><p>Thank you, Zegion. Thanks to you, I have regained my calm.\u300d</p><br/><p>Souei nods while expressing his gratitude to Zegion.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry about it.</p><br/><p>I will return to my position.</p><br/><p>Benimaru-dono, leave the labyrinth to me, you can go on the attack at ease.</p><br/><p>I swear that I will certainly protect Ramiris-sama and the people taking refuge within the labyrinth until the end.\u300d</p><br/><p>Benimaru nodded to Zegion\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Yes, that\u2019s right. They have the strongest guardian, that is Zegion, for their defense.</p><br/><p>There is nothing to be afraid of.</p><br/><p>And so, Tempest\u2019s executives began to move.</p><br/><p>Wiping out the anxiety from before, their expressions are filled with power.</p><br/><p>And their determination shone as they wish for their strength be recognized by their master, the Great Demon Lord Rimuru.</p><br/><p>Right now, they have reached the moment where they shall take flight from the protection of the Great Demon Lord[2].</p><br/><p>[1] Da Warudo, Toki yo tomare!

She had been the first to return.</p><br/><p>As Veldora had gone against their agreement after being left alone for just a short while, it could not be helped that there was a sharpness in her voice.</p><br/><p>However, Veldora did not seem to take notice. He kept pouring more batter over the grill and added shredded cabbage on top.</p><br/><p>It was a mystery as to where these ingredients were coming from, but he handled them expertly as he mixed them into the batter.</p><br/><p>And then he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cKaaa-hahahaha! Ramiris, do you want some too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But, that\u2019s not the problem!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris nodded to Veldora\u2019s light-hearted response but quickly remembered herself.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t be tricked by food! It was with this strong will that she rained down words of reproach over Veldora.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just talked about this earlier. We are supposed to act with caution!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Veldora just snickered at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cRamiris, calm down. If you\u2019re just going to complain about everything, I will just have to keep these spoils of war for myself, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this. If you put it together like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While waiting for the batter to cook, Veldora quickly assembled a robot.</p><br/><p>It was a torso on top of what looked like a tank.</p><br/><p>A simple machine with two arms.</p><br/><p>However, the left arm was distinctly shaped like a drill.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh. That\u2019s an interesting combination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks so cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to copy that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The children watched it with interest and were clearly impressed.</p><br/><p>This only made Veldora more and more arrogant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe. Of course. It should be no surprise that I can create a partner who is both cool and strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>He said with a satisfied nod.</p><br/><p>And then he glanced at Ramiris and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Ramiris? Will you still pretend to be uninterested?\u201d</p><br/><p>He must have been sure of his victory because he said this with a puffed-out chest.</p><br/><p>Veldora\u2019s words were more than enough to make Ramiris hesitate.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Uh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris\u2019s head seemed to spin as she began to wonder what to do.</p><br/><p>And it was then that a freshly cooked plate of okonomiyaki was put in front of her.</p><br/><p>It was an exquisite dish that used lots of shrimp and pork.</p><br/><p>Savory sauce, seaweed, and bonito flakes covered it. The smell alone was enough to make her drool.</p><br/><p>Ramiris gulped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is for you. Eat up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, aah\u2026okay. I will then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That strong will to resist any trickery now disappeared from Ramiris\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Veldora thought he had won then, but it did not last for long.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Ramiris. Do not be deceived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris was looking at the okonomiyaki with sparkling eyes when Beretta\u2019s warning reached her ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was clearly shaken as she looked around her.</p><br/><p>She looked at Veldora, then Beretta and then back at the plate of okonomiyaki. It was obvious that her heart was not sure.</p><br/><p>Ramiris really did want to side with Veldora, but her brain was telling her that it would not end well.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>Veldora watched her and smirked. Then he suddenly shouted, \u2018Rocket Puuuuuunch!\u2019</p><br/><p>And then, right in front of Ramiris\u2019s eyes, the newly made robot began to move.</p><br/><p>Bang!! There was a loud sound.</p><br/><p>And then the part passed the elbow of the right arm fired off like a rocket.</p><br/><p>The fist slammed into the wall.</p><br/><p>Veldora shouted again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd now the deathblow! Drill Break!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The robot heard this and started to move again.</p><br/><p>The caterpillar groaned and then the string attached to the right arm began to pull the body in.</p><br/><p>Once the right arm was back in its socket, the left arm rotated like a drill at a tremendous speed and slammed into the wall.</p><br/><p>There was a deafening sound.</p><br/><p>And then, destruction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWOOOW!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The children were greatly excited by this.</p><br/><p>And so was Ramiris.</p><br/><p>She stood up while still gripping her chopsticks and then shouted excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing! That was amazing, master!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKaahahahahaha! Kaa-hahahaha!! Of course, it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Delicious okonomiyaki.</p><br/><p>Children to play with.</p><br/><p>A cool robot.</p><br/><p>New entertainment.</p><br/><p>Everything was here.</p><br/><p>And so it went without saying, that Ramiris gave in.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Ramiris began to happily eat the okonomiyaki. Beretta sighed with exasperation.</p><br/><p>However, he had not given up yet.</p><br/><p>Ramiris was simple, so he had fully expected her to be tricked by Veldora.</p><br/><p>What was important, was when it came to determining who was responsible\u2013and that would happen for sure\u2013was how to ensure that Ramiris would not get in trouble.</p><br/><p>Because Ramiris\u2019s mistakes = him being rebuked. Or so Beretta thought.</p><br/><p>\u2013You were there, and yet you could not stop them?\u2013</p><br/><p>Beretta could imagine Rimuru\u2019s face as he asked this.</p><br/><p>You ask too much of me\u2013was how he really felt, but he would never say it out loud.</p><br/><p>Beretta took things very seriously.</p><br/><p>And so he wondered what it was that they needed.</p><br/><p>For instance, what he considered the ideal, was the relationship between Milim and Frey.</p><br/><p>As self-centered and forceful as Milim was, she somehow always obeyed what Frey said.</p><br/><p>Veldora also could not go against his sisters.</p><br/><p>If it was an order from Velzard or Velgrynd, Veldora would have no choice but to quietly listen.</p><br/><p>In the world, everyone had someone they were no match for.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t necessarily about combat ability, but there was a special relationship that determined who was above who.</p><br/><p>(Perhaps if I was trusted by Lord Ramiris more\u2026)</p><br/><p>Beretta thought.</p><br/><p>Beretta believed that Ramiris would listen to him more if she trusted him.</p><br/><p>But Beretta was mistaken.</p><br/><p>When it came to Milim and Frey, she also got quite the headache.</p><br/><p>It was the same with Veldora and his sisters.</p><br/><p>If Veldora really did listen to them obediently, then they would not have had such a hard time with him.</p><br/><p>While Veldora did not do much mischief these days, he had been responsible for much in the past.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

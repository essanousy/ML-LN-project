He was reckless and would acknowledge no opinions other than his own.</p><br/><p>In the end, Yuuki was a fool who I would never be able to understand.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>The world was cruel, but it offered you everything.</p><br/><p>That was the world that Veldanava had created.</p><br/><p>Alone in that space of nothingness, he had endured his solitude.</p><br/><p>And so he had then given birth to this world in order to distract himself from his boredom.</p><br/><p>And in this world, was born life. Beings who could act freely and make their will known, just as Veldanava had intended.</p><br/><p>After many years, humans were born as the receptacle of the soul, with free will and high intelligence.</p><br/><p>Veldanava was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>He had been bored in the world of nothingness. Watching the activities of the lifeforms was pleasurable enough, but the activities of these creatures called humans were emotionally moving to him.</p><br/><p>However, there was a problem.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198\"></span>These humans who had attained knowledge, they began to stimulate each other and eventually act in ways that he hadn\u2019t anticipated.</p><br/><p>If he left them alone, they would immediately begin to war and begin to walk down the path of destruction.</p><br/><p>He had created several different worlds, and yet all of them showed the same tendencies in the end.</p><br/><p>The reason for this was emotion.</p><br/><p>It was something that he had given as a means to stimulate people and to help them grow even more, but emotions that became too extreme had a tendency of wanting to eradicate the opinions of others.</p><br/><p>Different kinds of justice were born through different ways of thinking.</p><br/><p>That is what Veldanava thought.</p><br/><p>He decided that this phenomenon was a necessary evil, and so he accepted the way the world was as a testing ground for the soul.</p><br/><p>The warring would likely stop if humans were monitored completely.</p><br/><p>However, their emotions would no longer be stimulated, and the world would turn into a dystopia that might be equal, but lacked free will.</p><br/><p>And that was not the kind of world that Veldanava wanted.</p><br/><p>He experimented several times after that, trying to push humans into growing in the way that he wanted.</p><br/><p>Several parallel worlds existed with small details changed in each, allowing them to evolve in different ways.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199\"></span>Within this system, the humans with especially matured souls were selected to govern the souls with shorter life-spans. And so angels and demons were born.</p><br/><p>The system had been constructed so that the souls of all the dimensions would circulate.</p><br/><p>The watchers were limited to how much they could intervene, and commanded to prevent the basis of the world from falling apart.</p><br/><p>These were Guy, Ramiris, Dino and others like them.</p><br/><p>Because there was very little mana in the world that I was originally in, I never witnessed anything spiritual, but perhaps there were also guardians there.</p><br/><p>Well, none of that means anything now.</p><br/><p>In any case, the construction of the system is complete.</p><br/><p>The slaying of the giants who appeared irregularly is finished, and the world is now stable.</p><br/><p>Just when everything was starting to move well, the wheel of destiny began to turn.</p><br/><p>Veldanava meets Lucia and falls in love.</p><br/><p>And the two loved each other, and Milim was born.</p><br/><p>When this happened, Veldanava had lost all of his power, and I can speculate that this had to do with the binding force of the world.</p><br/><p>This reaction we call a force\u2013the constructed system, it had decided that Lucia\u2019s existence was one of evil.</p><br/><p>According to the system, God\u2019s love must be shared equally.</p><br/><p>And so Veldanava\u2019s love for a specific individual must have caused an error.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600\"></span>Ultimately, the price that had to be paid to fix the tear in the system was the lives of Veldanava and Lucia.</p><br/><p>Velda\u2019s idea to convict the system that had destroyed its own creator was not impossible to understand. However, it was still a self-serving desire and went against the will of Veldanava.</p><br/><p>In the end, Veldanava had loved this world, and he wanted Milim, who was his daughter, to live.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had sacrificed himself for the system was proof of this.</p><br/><p>\u2013Even if he had lost all of his abilities, it was still impossible for someone who was a god to be killed by a human.</p><br/><p>But Velda had not understood this.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601\"></span>And that is why he cooperated with Yuuki and tried to destroy the world\u2026 It really was a foolish thing.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-195\"></span>I opened my eyes slightly.</p><br/><p>The final fight with Yuuki had started, and\u2013</p><br/><p>[Are you awake now?]</p><br/><p>Ah, Ciel was talking to me. But where were we?</p><br/><p>And what happened to Veldora?</p><br/><p>[This is a world at the end. Or you might also call it the \u2018End of Space-time. Veldora has been isolated in an \u2018Imaginary Space.\u2019 So he is completely safe and there is no need to worry.]</p><br/><p>I see, so Veldora was safe.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s good\u2026 uh, huh? This is just a vast world with nothing, but, did she say \u2018End of Space-time\u2019? Indeed, time does not flow and is suspended here. And I cannot detect the spreading of space either\u2026</p><br/><p>[Yes. The flow of time has stopped in this world. And the spread of space has also ended, and has become nothingness according to the laws of entropy.]</p><br/><p>Has it? You talk about it as if you\u2019ve observed it happening?</p><br/><p>[Indeed. We have been thrown into the far end of Space-time through Yuuki\u2019s attack. The star has exceeded its lifespan, but the world has not been destroyed yet. Judging by this, Yuuki must have not been able to destroy the world itself. I speculate that after destroying all the stars as a space-time continuum, his lifespan had ended. However, I cannot determine if his wish had been fulfilled through this. After that, I floated off into space, and witnessed the ending of the universe.]</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-196\"></span>\u2013I couldn\u2019t quite understand what exactly Ciel was saying\u2026</p><br/><p>Did she witness the end of the universe? What was that supposed to mean\u2026?</p><br/><p>I mean, there was no way you could stay alive in such a situation.</p><br/><p>There were much more believable lies to tell\u2013but then I remembered, Ciel did not tell lies.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>Sometimes, I was fooled by her, but it wasn\u2019t so much that she lied, but that I had misunderstood her\u2013or she made me\u2013that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>In that case, then we were really in a world at the end!?</p><br/><p>[Yes, that is right. Well then, what will you do now?]</p><br/><p>What will I do?</p><br/><p>[As so much time has passed, there is an enormous amount of energy from \u2018Turn Null\u2019 that has been stored. Veldanava seems to have lost \u2018Turn Null\u2019 when creating the world, but you still have \u2018Imaginary Space\u2019, so there should not be a problem. As \u2018Imaginary Space\u2019 is infinite, it has not become full, but it has been loaded with enough energy to rebuild worlds tens of thousands of times over. If I may add, this means that you can replicate every person you were ever involved with including their memories, you can create a world that is as close as you can possibly get to the world you left. What will you do?]</p><br/><p>Wha\u2026? I was shocked by the question.</p><br/><p>Yes. If this really was the \u2018End of Space-time,\u2019 then that meant that Benimaru, Shuna, Tempest, and their friends, Diablo and the demons, Guy and Ramiris and Milim, all of those that I\u2019ve loved were nowhere within this world. I finally understood that.</p><br/><p>In other words, I had lost against Yuuki.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198\"></span>\u201cDamn it!! Shit, this means that I completely lost to Yuuki!!\u201d</p><br/><p>[No, that is wrong. Yuuki was unable to destroy you.]</p><br/><p>But, I was unable to protect those I loved.</p><br/><p>Then there was no point. There was no point if I was the only one who survived.</p><br/><p>And even if their memory and DNA could be recreated to be exactly the same, would that still really be them?</p><br/><p>Would I be able to interact with them in the same way when I had created them with my own hands!?</p><br/><p>It was nonsense, damn it!!</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a thing would just be fake! We can make excuses, but I still lost to Yuuki\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Logically, Ciel was thinking that I should create a new world without the heretic that was Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Indeed, that was probably the right answer.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199\"></span>You could say that there was nothing wrong with it.</p><br/><p>However, that was not enough to satiate me.</p><br/><p>How could I resurrect my dead friends in such a way just to heal my own loneliness? I would rather die than do such a thing.</p><br/><p>I knew that I was being obstinate.</p><br/><p>But that was also why I could not allow myself to just create a world that was convenient for me.</p><br/><p>In such a world, the existence that was me was likely to rot away and die.</p><br/><p>It was better to choose a proud loneliness than to hold on to the past just to comfort yourself.</p><br/><p>[I expected that you would answer in this way.]</p><br/><p>I had shouted out with rage, but Ciel answered as if she were pleased.</p><br/><p>And then she continued.</p><br/><p>[Also, you have not been defeated by Yuuki. You just need to go and beat him right now.]</p><br/><p>Ciel offered as if it were nothing.</p><br/><p>Go and beat him now? Return to the past that was long gone?</p><br/><p>Was such a thing possible\u2026</p><br/><p>Chloe had Time Leap which could read memories from the future, but that was really just an ability that allowed you to return to your past self.</p><br/><p>And it could not be activated where time had been stopped.</p><br/><p>Yuuki had carefully planned to block such escape routes when he stopped time.</p><br/><p>[No, there should be no problem. Mai\u2019s newly acquired \u2018Teleport\u2019 was nothing more than a prototype for a different ability. This ability was not an \u2018ability that allowed you to return to a place you had been\u2019 but was an \u2018ability that allowed you to travel through space-time and arrive at the desired point.\u2019 As you can control time and space, going back into time should be an easy thing for you.]</p><br/><p>I was stunned.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601\"></span>No wonder Ciel had acted so normally in spite of my rage.</p><br/><p>From the beginning, she had already known what I had wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s get going and quickly dispose of that idiot. You know it don\u2019t you? That I hate to lose!\u201d</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-195\"></span></p><br/><p>[As you wish, my lord.]</p><br/><p>Ciel answered my order.</p><br/><p>In the same easy way as always. This was business as usual.</p><br/><p>But I had only just awakened, Ciel had lived through countless millennia as she waited for me to wake up.</p><br/><p>There was an undisguisable joy in the voice that answered my command.</p><br/><p>In order to answer to her expectations, I had to choose the world that felt right for me.</p><br/><p>Defeat was not an option.</p><br/><p>Well then, it\u2019s about time I got this over with.</p><br/><p>At the same time that I thought this, I time warped back into the past.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-196\"></span>I immediately sense that I was in a different place.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I could also sense that a bundle of energy that was big enough to destroy the world was headed straight towards me.</p><br/><p>But instead of panicking, I swallow the whole blast.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s surprisingly tasty.</p><br/><p>It seems that it allowed me to recover what energy that had depleted with the time warp.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you!?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>The shocked cry had come from Yuuki, who stood behind me.</p><br/><p>Well, I had planned to return to the same point that I had disappeared in, but it seems that some time had elapsed.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it was still near perfect timing that couldn\u2019t even be called a slight deviation in the grand scheme of things. And it was my first time too.</p><br/><p>After all, from what I could observe, not a single person here had any injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that you, Rimuru?\u201d</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198\"></span>A beautiful woman with rainbow colored hair asked me hesitantly.</p><br/><p>Who wants to know!? I couldn\u2019t help but say.</p><br/><p>However, judging by her slightly light-headed air, I realized that this person was probably Ramiris.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Ramiris? So you\u2019ve grown?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2014!! Stupid-stupid-idiot-idiot\u2014!! We were so worried about you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTha-that\u2019s right! Hiding just so you can scare us like this, what a rotten personality. Your presence had completely vanished from this world, and we all believed that you had been blown away into the future!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just casually nullified our greatest weapons\u2026 Also, what\u2019s with this look? You seem to have grown since a moment ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>While it seemed that not much time had elapsed, they had still been incredibly worried about my disappearance.</p><br/><p>Also, apparently the energy that I had just eaten was something that Guy and others had used all their power to unleash onto Yuuki. On one hand, I felt a little bad for them, but it was also true that something so weak would have probably just made Yuuki stronger instead. It was not a big deal.</p><br/><p>But more importantly, what about my appearance?</p><br/><p>I thought as I looked down at myself. Then I realized that I had grown into an adult.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199\"></span>I had no breasts or manhood either, so if I was asked if this growth had any meaning, well, I would have to say no.</p><br/><p>I knew that Ciel had been creating energy all of this time, so it was likely an effect of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, who cares about such trivial matters. We have not finished fighting yet. I need to put this guy out of his misery. So with that said, give me a minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tell them before turning to face Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Guy didn\u2019t say anything. His sword was sheathed and his arms folded.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Rimuru could lose no matter how you look at it. This is a real checkmate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guy answered Ramiris and shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, those kinds of lines are flags\u2026but then again, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much room for a flag\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris murmured.</p><br/><p>After that in a quieter voice, she muttered about going through the trouble of returning to her original form\u2026but now there was no meaning to it. She looked sad. It might be a good thing to do something to cheer her up later.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Diablo had believed that I would return because he had a smug look on his face as if he thought it was the most normal thing. Though his expression when he looked at me was a little entranced. Would I be able to return to my original self? I was a little worried.</p><br/><p>Chloe looked like she was about to cry, but just like Guy, she had sheathed her sword and decided to watch over the fight. She must believe in me. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let you down.</p><br/><p>Feeling everyone\u2019s support at my back, I thrust out my katana in Yuuki\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s finish this. I played along with your childish games for long enough. Don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s time for a break?\u201d</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601\"></span>\u201cImpossible!? Rimuru, you were supposed to have been completely shot off into the \u2018end of space-time\u2019!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as he shouted as if he did not want to admit that this was real.</p><br/><p>I understood how he felt.</p><br/><p>But he really picked the wrong person to mess with.</p><br/><p>Had he been against anyone else, he might have had a chance of winning.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I was shot off alright. I fell right into your plans because my buddy was busy analyzing the primitive magic. It was quite impressive of you. But unfortunately, it was not going to be effective with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tell Yuuki as if it had been nothing at all.</p><br/><p>[I am quite hurt that you are blaming me for falling into the trap. However, it is true that I had an interest in primitive magic. It makes me angry, but I won\u2019t deny it.]</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-195\"></span>Ciel said without much amusement but plenty of resentment. I decided to ignore her.</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, I wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible, no\u2026 Time leap\u2026? And with a complete shape, to the desired place\u2026 From\u2026the \u2018end of space-time\u2019 you say\u2026? It can\u2019t be\u2026 No, there is no way that someone who can do such a thing exists\u2026 That would make you something like a transcendent God\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuuki continued to mumble in this vein.</p><br/><p>You could see that he was desperate to deny the reality of the situation.</p><br/><p>And then\u2013</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he put all his force behind the sword and slashed in my direction.</p><br/><p>There was no need for me to dodge, instead, I thrust out my left hand and grabbed the blade.</p><br/><p>The blade which had swung down at a god-like speed was now stuck between my thumb and forefinger. It was completely still.</p><br/><p>I glance at Yuuki who was stunned, then I unleash a light kick.</p><br/><p>Being on the receiving end of it, Yuuki dropped his sword\u2013Veldanava, and went flying backward.</p><br/><p>While he would still be alive, he was likely to have lost half of his ability to fight.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-196\"></span>This was because I had extracted a negative energy from \u2018Turn Null\u2019 that hindered your life support, and combined it into the kick.</p><br/><p>Yuuki coughed violently before looking up at me with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what the hell are you\u2014!?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>There was shock and confusion in his face as he shouted towards me.</p><br/><p>I laugh as I hear this.</p><br/><p>Yuuki was like a humorous caricature.</p><br/><p>He was so incredibly ignorant, and all I could do was laugh.</p><br/><p>Satoru Mikami.</p><br/><p>Rimuru Tempest.</p><br/><p>\u2013Or did he perhaps think that I was Veldanava?</p><br/><p>Me? Who am I, you ask?</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198\"></span>Such a thing is obvious.</p><br/><p>My name is\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>A flash.</p><br/><p>A blinding degree of light suddenly gushed through the area.</p><br/><p>And then an ominous unearthly air that was the color of shadows began to pour from my body as if to swallow up the light.</p><br/><p>The current of light gently enveloped Ramiris, Milim and my other friends. Healing all of their wounds, and protecting them from the shadowy air of evil.</p><br/><p>As for any who were not protected by the light\u2013as for Yuuki\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, don\u2019t come any closer! The world. I wanted to\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to be struggling with all of his might, but his body was deteriorating without him being able to do anything about it.</p><br/><p><span class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\" id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199\"></span>\u201cGive up. You went too far. If you do something wrong, then you have to repent, no? Repenting of your ways is the least you can do. In the \u2018Imaginary Space\u2019 inside of me, you can think about your selfishness and immaturity. That is the extent of what I am allowing you to have.\u201d</p><br/><p>I coldly declare.</p><br/><p>Yuuki continued to struggle until the end, but it was all in vain.</p><br/><p>He had transferred all of his abilities into the Veldanava Sword, and so there was almost nothing he could do at this point.</p><br/><p>\u2013No, don\u2019t lock me up. Like this, not like this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013Yuuki, is this because I was unable to lead you until the end after all? Really, boy.

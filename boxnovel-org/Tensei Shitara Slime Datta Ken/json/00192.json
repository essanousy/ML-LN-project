However, since she was energetic as soon as she was safe it was kind of amusing.</p><br/><p>Earning approval from such a child is easy.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, eat this and cheer up. Ah, that\u2019s right. Could you give your approval for this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! This is pudding right! I can eat all of it!? Then anything is OK!\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, I easily got her to affix her magic seal[1] whilst her eyes had been snatched away by the pudding.</p><br/><p>It is very easy to deal with her, it saved me some trouble.</p><br/><p>I got the approval from Ruminas, who had flown into a rage after she found out that the preparations she had made against the Empire\u2019s army was in vain because of Veldora.</p><br/><p>By the way, I had also informed Leon and he willingly gave his approval.</p><br/><p>Because Milim has not been allowed to play these days, her dissatisfaction seems to have piled up,</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, how about you come here to play under the pretense of attending the conference?\u300d</p><br/><p>She admired this idea of mine.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected of you! Rimuru is as wonderfully wise as always!\u300d </p><br/><p>She was excited with the condition and seems to have immediately gone to persuade Frey.</p><br/><p>Because I could receive her approval with ease, let\u2019s prepare pudding, which is popular with Ramiris as well, when she comes to Tempest to play.</p><br/><p>And so, just like that, I had gathered the approval of 5 Demon Lords\u2019 (including myself).</p><br/><p>While I was doing skill synthesis in the Empire, the talk had finished quickly because I had made a few preliminary arrangements.</p><br/><p>Aside from sharing the information, there is a need to prepare for the Great War that is about to occur.</p><br/><p>As such, holding the Walpurgis as soon as possible is the preferred outcome.</p><br/><p>Five days have passed and I returned to Tempest, the next day being the Walpurgis.</p><br/><p>Because Krishna had arrived on schedule, I can hold the Walpurgis without a problem.</p><br/><p>With Dino\u2019s betrayal, the Octogram has become seven now.</p><br/><p>However, all the members, besides Ramiris, are awakened Demon Lord class, which has never been seen until now.</p><br/><p>All of their level are too high, which contrarily makes it so that the word \u201cawakened\u201d has lost its value.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it might be a good thing.</p><br/><p>At any rate, preparations are everything.</p><br/><p>Milim seems to be arriving in the morning, so we prepared for her reception.</p><br/><p>After the Walpurgis is over, she will be staying here for three additional days.</p><br/><p>Because I am expecting to be occupied with the preparations, I\u2019m doubtful about whether I will have any time to play hooky, but just a little should be alright.</p><br/><p>She seems to be looking forward to being with Veldora and Ramiris, it might be a good idea to request the others to overlook it.</p><br/><p>Then, a question suddenly arose.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, Milim has always traveled by flying.</p><br/><p>Though, since Frey is also coming here by flying it hadn\u2019t become a question before, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Milim visit via warp gate.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, she can\u2019t use transfer (teleportation)?</p><br/><p>Oh well, since she is absurdly fast, with Frey\u2019s maximum speed, the one-way trip distance can be covered in about five hours.</p><br/><p>To be at subsonic speeds for five hours, the distance is quite far. I think that my sense of distance has become a bit odd.</p><br/><p>No, in the case of my current senses, I guess it\u2019s might be suitable\u2026 how complicated.</p><br/><p>I think it\u2019s my sense from when I was a human, though it can\u2019t be helped. Besides, it might be normal for my subordinates.</p><br/><p>I will ask Milim whether she is able to use teleportation or not when she arrives.</p><br/><p>If she can\u2019t, then first I should install a magic formation for teleportation and let her use it anytime.</p><br/><p>Oh well, if Milim flies with all her might, she can arrive here without taking more than 30 minutes.</p><br/><p>Well then.</p><br/><p>Milim arrived without any problems and went over to the Walpurgis\u2019 meeting place.</p><br/><p>As we were waiting and relaxing by ourselves whilst enjoying a chat in the room, like the last time, Mizari and Hirari came to pick us up.</p><br/><p>\u300eDemon Lord Rimuru-sama, for employing the \u201cSecret Method of Evolution\u201d on us, thank you very much!\u300f</p><br/><p>Apparently, they completed their evolution and that\u2019s why they had thanked me.</p><br/><p>Though they were both bowing their heads, it really was not such a big deal. However, they might think it is because only I can use it.</p><br/><p>\u300cN? \u201cSecret Method of Evolution\u201d, what\u2019s that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim seemed to be interested in the topic, however, I deceived her with cake.</p><br/><p>Because Milim has a child-like personality, similar to Ramiris, it\u2019s easy.</p><br/><p>After I deceived Milim, we passed through the gate, created by Mizari, entering into the meeting hall.</p><br/><p>My attendants are Shion and Diablo.</p><br/><p>Milim has Frey as her chaperon.</p><br/><p>Ramiris is sitting on Beretta\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>At this timing, I take a look at Beretta\u2019s abilities,</p><br/><p>Name: Beretta</p><br/><p>Race: Chaos Metalloid (High Rank Divine Monster Spirit)</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: Divine Protection of the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Title: Ramiris\u2019s Guardian</p><br/><p>Magic:\u3008Darkness Magic\u3009</p><br/><p>Skills: Ultimate Gift</p><br/><p> \u300eMachine Doll Lord Deus Ex Machina\u300f</p><br/><p> \u2026Thought Acceleration\u30fbCondition Control\u30fbMineral Manipulation</p><br/><p> Space Manipulation\u30fbMultiple Barrier</p><br/><p> Normal Skills\u2026\u300eOmnipotent Perception\u300f\u300eDemon Lord\u2019s Haki\u300f</p><br/><p> Combat Skills\u2026\u300eLaw Manipulation\uff08Earth\uff09\u300f\u300eHoly Demonic Fusion\u300f</p><br/><p>Resistance: Physical Attack Nullification, Status Change Nullification,</p><br/><p> Spiritual Attack Nullification, Natural Effects Nullification, </p><br/><p> Holy-Demonic(Hybrid) Attack Resistance</p><br/><p>Those were the results.</p><br/><p>My oh my. He seems to be able to create minerals freely. It goes without saying though, raw materials are still needed.</p><br/><p>An ability to manipulate elements, something like that, I guess?</p><br/><p>Next would be his Condition Control, it is simply intriguing. The state of the mineral\u2015\u2015no, let\u2019s stop calling it with such troublesome wording.</p><br/><p>Simply put, it is an ability that makes it so that he can freely manipulate metal.</p><br/><p>He can act like a certain guy with tough liquid metal who appeared in a movie[2], such a thing could be possible.</p><br/><p>His regular form is like that of a high-class work of art, with globe joints, kind of like a doll. However, he can freely manipulate Adamantite, so of course, he can change his figure as he pleases and bring out weapons of various shapes. Also, he seems to be able to absorb objects, like a slime, if he comes into contact with them.</p><br/><p>He has evolved into a terrifying metal life form that is similar to a Spiritual Life form.</p><br/><p>The doll I had made on a whim for a demon i summoned has achieved a surprising evolution.</p><br/><p>The seven of us entered the hall, led by the guide.</p><br/><p>Alrighty then.</p><br/><p>Because I have business with Guy, first, I urge Milim and the others to sit down on their seats.</p><br/><p>They seem to want to ask me a question, but they obeyed nonetheless, which helped greatly. Maybe because I said there will be cake later.</p><br/><p>I left behind Milim and Ramiris, having Mizari lead me to Guy.</p><br/><p>Actually, Chloe had come to meet me last night.</p><br/><p>We were relaxing and sitting in the parlor while having a talk about the current situation.</p><br/><p>Because I don\u2019t need sleep, in the end we had a long conversation till the break of dawn.</p><br/><p>I was able to slowly hear her story, of her leaping into the past, as well as about Hinata\u2019s soul after she had parted with me.</p><br/><p>\u300cSensei\u2015\u2015have I become strong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah, you have became strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yes, Chloe is shouldering a hardship that can\u2019t easily be described with words.</p><br/><p>As she appreciates my consolation and words, it would be rude if I thoughtlessly said that.</p><br/><p>Therefore,</p><br/><p>\u300cHah! You are still weak. Still not good, not good at all.</p><br/><p>Such a thing, as showing your weaknesses to a Demon Lord, is out of the question if you are a \u201cHero\u201d.</p><br/><p>Well, I admit that you have done your best.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Therefore, endure a bit longer.\u300d</p><br/><p>I said as such, it was irritating that I had no choice but to put on airs to deceive her.</p><br/><p>Chloe seemed to be happy, to be relieved, I saw her making such expressions.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, I had a match with Chloe.</p><br/><p>I checked out the ability of the strongest \u201cHero\u201d to ascertain whether she could face Guy or not.</p><br/><p>Two practice swords were prepared, we decided to use them.</p><br/><p>\u300cSensei, you became taller right? Somehow, your vibes resemble Shizu-sensei\u300d</p><br/><p>While saying those words, Chloe received the practice sword.</p><br/><p>Do I resemble her? Because she was the origin of my human form, I might have inherited her vibes as well.</p><br/><p>There was no referee. It was a test of strength to the end.</p><br/><p>I threw a coin into the air, and when it hit the ground, it would signal for the start of the match.</p><br/><p>As we faced each other calmly, I lightly threw the coin.</p><br/><p>The coin drew a parabola curve while rotating. It revolved in the air before falling. The coin gave a clear \u2018ting\u2019 as it hit the ground.</p><br/><p>Chloe and I moved at the same time.</p><br/><p>Opposing Chloe\u2019s Ultimate Skill\u300eSpace-Time Lord Yogg-Sothoth\u300fwas my Ultimate Skill\u300eVoid God Azathoth\u300f.</p><br/><p>The match was in a stalemate, during which, I read a momentary gap in Chloe\u2019s defense with\u300eFuture Prediction\u300f.</p><br/><p>As I was going to swing my practice sword aiming for that, I noticed that I had become the side receiving an attack..</p><br/><p>A blade approached right in front of my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cEhehe. It\u2019s my win right!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Is this for real!?</p><br/><p>I was dumbfounded when I heard Chloe\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>This is far from checking whether she can face Guy or not, it had become an easy defeat for me.</p><br/><p>\u300aMaster, the ability of Time Control has been unleashed\u300b</p><br/><p>I use my ability as I was being led to by the voice.</p><br/><p>Though I didn\u2019t know what it was, I felt like I could manage, somehow, if I used it.</p><br/><p>The world stopped when I used the ability.</p><br/><p>I understood that the world had stop moving, like it was suspended, because my cognition had been enhanced by 1 million times.</p><br/><p>Not just my cognition but also my movement, to the point I can move at the speed of 1 million times normal speed. In other words, by controlling the flow of time, it is possible to accelerate myself.</p><br/><p>It is a superpower[3] that is different from super acceleration[4], in principle. Due to the backlash of this ability, I can\u2019t cause any physical effects at all.</p><br/><p>Being able to move under the rules of this ability was only me\u2015\u2015no, there\u2019s one other person who can.</p><br/><p>That person is Chloe.</p><br/><p>(Awawa. As expected of Rimuru-sensei! You can exist[5] in this \u201cSuspended World\u201d.)</p><br/><p>(Skip it! Something like this, for a Demon Lord like me, such a thing is easy, you know!)</p><br/><p>Although I hadn\u2019t intended to show off, I answered like that.</p><br/><p>I mustn\u2019t display weakness to my student, even if she was just my student for a few months.</p><br/><p>If compared to the months and years that Chloe has lived, it would just be a few trifling months.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015No. For me, those few months (daily lives) were a treasure surpassing everything else\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Was it an auditory hallucination?</p><br/><p>It felt like I heard something.</p><br/><p>My match with Chloe ended in a draw.</p><br/><p>Chloe\u2019s swordsmanship, that has reached the peak, is formidable indeed. I believe that, if compared with my subordinates, her skill is beyond Albert and Agera.</p><br/><p>There will be no threats to her when she combines her swordsmanship and her time stopping ability.</p><br/><p>The use of emission type power is impossible inside the \u201cSuspended World\u201d, so magic can\u2019t be invoked. Well, I might be able to do it if I become accustomed to it, but it seems to be very difficult.</p><br/><p>Also,\u300eFuture Prediction\u300f cannot be used due to the activation of \u201cSuspended World\u201d. I could only depend on pure technique and physical ability. Although, an ability that activates through touch seems to be usable.</p><br/><p>So, if someone who is a master swordsman, like Chloe, did have such an ability, they could easily become the strongest.</p><br/><p>Oh well, I don\u2019t think there are many people who can move inside the \u201cSuspended World\u201d anyway.</p><br/><p>Diablo, Benimaru and Zegion, only these three among my subordinates, seem likely to become able to do it.</p><br/><p>Naturally, it is impossible for them to do under the current conditions. With some kind of chance, it is on the scale of one to ten thousand. Even though they could receive this ability as a gift, they wouldn\u2019t be able to use it.</p><br/><p>Chloe\u2019s purpose might be, to let me experience \u201cSuspended World\u201d and see whether I could acquire it or not.</p><br/><p>I thought all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>If that is so, did I meet Chloe\u2019s expectation?</p><br/><p>Because I promised that I would, in one way or another, defeat Yuuki and free Chloe, so she doesn\u2019t need to worry.</p><br/><p>Defeat is not allowed. I should show it with my results.</p><br/><p>After the match, we conversed for a little longer.</p><br/><p>Chloe seems to have seen when Dino\u2019s colleagues had attacked the town and had wanted to help. However, there was no need for Chloe\u2019s help, as she told me that my followers are strong.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a bit embarrassed, but I\u2019m glad that my subordinates were praised.</p><br/><p>We talked about such topics for a while, and in the end Chloe said this, </p><br/><p>\u300cSensei. When the Great War begins, I will challenge Demon Lord Guy Crimson for a match.</p><br/><p>The order given to me is to stop Guy.</p><br/><p>So, if Demon Lord Guy Crimson doesn\u2019t participate in the Great War, there will be no need to fight an unnecessary battle.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s possible, with Sensei\u2019s persuasion, please somehow stop Guy.</p><br/><p>As I will be looking for the way to remove the curse, somehow\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOk. Guy is unexpectedly a reasonable guy, I will talk to him and try to get his consent.</p><br/><p>You seem to get along with Leon, you should ask for his help as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay! I\u2019m going to go meet Leon Onii-chan then.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh. Then, take care~\u300d</p><br/><p>As I say so, I pat Chloe\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u300cEhehe\u300d</p><br/><p>Chloe laughed and smiled happily, then she lifted her head after she bowed to me.</p><br/><p>Her expression was dignified and tense, there was none of the childishness that she had shown but a moment ago.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, Sensei\u2026.. May fortune be with you in war!\u300d</p><br/><p>Leaving those words behind, Chloe left.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>I met Guy,</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s why, just a bit more, until Chloe\u2019s release!\u300d</p><br/><p>And I emphasized that.</p><br/><p>What kind of reaction will i get from Guy? I wonder.</p><br/><p>However, I am not concerned.</p><br/><p>Chloe\u2019s release is the most important thing to me, Guy\u2019s circumstances don\u2019t matter to me.</p><br/><p>Chloe is extremely strong, but Guy is just as strong. Honestly, no one can imagine what is going to happen if those two fight each other.</p><br/><p>After all, both of them seem to have concealed their true strength.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou also, so suddenly\u2026\u2026 However, I understand the story.</p><br/><p> If it\u2019s the \u201cHero\u201d, there is no lack for an opponent.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she is the strongest among the awakened Heroes who's been called names like \u201cThe Nameless Hero\u201d and \u201cJet Black Hero\u201d.</p><br/><p>However, she is the person Leon was searching for as well as Ruminas\u2019 loved one, what a small world right?\u2026..</p><br/><p>Oh well. I will at least accompany her in this farce. She is an adequate opponent.</p><br/><p>If it is such a situation, it is a foolish action to be exhausted at this point.\u300d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Guy agreed to it easily.</p><br/><p>He seems to feel a bit indebted to me since I awakened his subordinates last time.</p><br/><p>No\u2026.. he might just be looking forward to his fight with Chloe.</p><br/><p>Although, I don\u2019t think that there will be any problem for Chloe\u2019s safety, as I got both of their consent to not use all of their power and keep it down to the degree of a skirmish\u2026.. I am still a little worried.</p><br/><p>Guy is a battle maniac as well, it would be good if it doesn\u2019t become a serious and fired up battle.</p><br/><p>Such matters, I will let nature take its course.</p><br/><p>However, I am glad that I have a good relationship with Guy.</p><br/><p>Because it used to be common sense that fellow Demon Lords don\u2019t get along, Yuuki hasn\u2019t seemed to notice that we are making connections in the back.</p><br/><p>If he knew, the order he gave to Chloe would be different.</p><br/><p>Oh well, although Dino knows it, to some degree, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t hear the whole story of when Guy came here.</p><br/><p>He has leaked something along the lines of Milim coming to play.</p><br/><p>About Ruminas coming to the research facility, so he might have figured out the cooperation between me and Ruminas.</p><br/><p>However, as I refrained from contacting Leon, I don\u2019t think that Dino noticed our alliance.</p><br/><p>Dino is not a hard worker, because of that, he is trustworthy in the things that he doesn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Thinking that I and Guy are not close, I believe that his objective will be to strike down both Guy and Chloe.</p><br/><p>No, if I think about it, in contrast to Yuuki, either result might be good for Angra Mainyu.</p><br/><p>If his aim is to take them down together, he would order Chloe to fight to the death, instead the instruction is only to keep Guy busy, his main purpose might be to make a situation where Guy can\u2019t participate in the war?</p><br/><p>\u300aI believe his main purpose is to decrease the degree of his ruling influence.</p><br/><p>If he strengthens his control over Chloe, it will become impossible for him to let out all of his ability.</p><br/><p>You can think of it as this; by giving a loose order to Chloe, the ruling influence will be lost.</p><br/><p>The current Angra Mainyu (Yuuki) is in the condition to use 100% of his power.</p><br/><p>And there\u2019s another.</p><br/><p>While the purpose of Yuuki and Angra Mainyuu are the same, the methods they use are completely different.\u300b</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>In other words, he judged that it is more strategic and meaningful to use Chloe loosely, so that he can fight with all of his power.</p><br/><p>Certainly, when using the strongest yet complicated force, it can\u2019t be helped that he would try to keep it close at hand.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s about how to use that fighting potential.</p><br/><p>If it was Yuuki, he would not be able to effectively utilize it. But Angra Mainyu would make sure to use everything.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015It looks like it\u2019s going to be tough.</p><br/><p>He is pretentious, like Yuuki, the type that doesn\u2019t take detours.</p><br/><p>For his goal, he will make the optimal operation. Such an opponent is very troublesome.</p><br/><p>I must brace myself so that I can handle it carefully.</p><br/><p>Having finished my negotiations with Guy, we returned to the meeting hall.</p><br/><p>All of the members are already present at the round table except for me and Guy.</p><br/><p>No, wait, Dino isn\u2019t here. In a sense, he\u2019d be a big shot if he did come.</p><br/><p>The meeting began the instant Guy sat down in his seat.</p><br/><p>First of all, a status report from me. I distributed the document which I had made, and showed them the analysis of the war with the empire.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I declared that the Empire\u2019s territory has become my territory, for which I received each of the other Demon Lords\u2019 approval.</p><br/><p>Usually, interruptions will come at this point and it would become a quarrel, which was the common pattern.</p><br/><p>However, for this time, no one objected and so I got the territory with a one-sided game (one-sided landslide victory).</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not in a situation where I\u2019m weak and could be beaten.</p><br/><p>Rather I got a lot stronger and haven\u2019t weakened whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Anyway, I believe that there isn\u2019t anyone who would complain against me among the current Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t oppose my interest as there is no merit in being hostile against me.</p><br/><p>And so, the war report was finished and we moved into the explanation of the current flow of the situation.</p><br/><p>After I finished a general explanation,</p><br/><p>\u300cDid Dino betray us?\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Dagruel murmured in a small voice.</p><br/><p>Guy was not surprised as he seems to have had some presumption on it. But one might need to think from Dagruel\u2019s perceptive, as he was close to Dino.</p><br/><p>\u300cRather than betraying us, it seems he was on the other side from the beginning.</p><br/><p>I mean, I get the feeling that he would be close to a guy with a laid back personality, like Yuuki.\u300d</p><br/><p>With my nonchalant words, Dagruel and Guy stopped moving.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. That guy (Dino), what\u2019s he so frolic about, he came to kill me, you see!</p><br/><p>He said some reason that I didn\u2019t understand, like how I became an obstacle for that person or something, it seemed to be an old acquaintance of his.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris supplemented my words, and it seems to be the clincher.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo way.\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy mutters,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s impossible. But maybe\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Dagruel was thinking about something with a difficult face.</p><br/><p>It seems something is bothering him.</p><br/><p>After that, the meeting progressed without a hitch.</p><br/><p>Guy stays put, as he promised me.</p><br/><p>However, he entrusted everything to his subordinate Mizari, preparing so that she can deal with anything that may happen.</p><br/><p>Hirari will devoted herself as Guy\u2019s personal bodyguard, to provide for any contingency. Because the prideful Guy would never arrange it, it is probably her own decision.</p><br/><p>By evolving, Mizari and Hirari have likely begun to moved by their own free will to a greater extent.</p><br/><p>Ruminas will be maintaining the status quo.</p><br/><p>As she had prepared armaments in preparation for the Empire\u2019s invasion and was ready to go to the war, I asked her to maintain her current state.</p><br/><p>We should be cautious, since it is uncertain when the army of angels will strike.</p><br/><p>Since Angra Mainyu\u2019s purpose is world annihilation, he will not hesitate to invade the western countries.</p><br/><p>Both Leon and Dagruel each possess their own army.</p><br/><p>In the case of Milim, Karion is in the middle of organizing the newly created army.</p><br/><p>Of course, as is appropriate for the name of Demon Lord, the army didn\u2019t seem to miss any combat training even during peacetime.</p><br/><p>It is the proper duty for a Demon Lord to protect their domain.</p><br/><p>So they will defend their own territory. Because humans can\u2019t live in the territory ruled by Guy, it has nothing to do with the current situation, so his land is unrelated.</p><br/><p>Certainly, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems even if I didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>However, Guy\u2019s subordinates will actually be the defense of the western countries as a reserve force under Mizari\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>Having misread the relations between us, Angra Mainyu\u2019s calculation would go amiss. It could be said that this is thanks to Dino, with his irresponsible investigation.</p><br/><p>With that, I don\u2019t think the situation is bad.</p><br/><p>Next, it would be great if the enemy forces doesn\u2019t become more powerful than our expectations......</p><br/><p>Oh well, making preparations for such a situation is the main reason of today\u2019s conference.</p><br/><p>We adjusted our plans so that we can smoothly perform a mutual cooperative system and made some detailed arrangements.</p><br/><p>The conference was finished just like that, without any problem.</p><br/><p>Each of us were preparing for the decisive battle with the angel army and we will immediately contact each other in case of an emergency.</p><br/><p>If it is possible, we arranged an agreement to help when we can, and it had become a significant matter.</p><br/><p>In case of emergency, it seems I needed to visit Milim\u2019s country and Dagruel\u2019s country.</p><br/><p>I installed the magic formations for teleportation, I want to make sure I can come and go.</p><br/><p>In the end, after the conference, I had Mizari take me to various places and recorded the location information.</p><br/><p>At that time, I confirmed that Milim and Dagruel are unable to use teleportation. Of course, Ramiris too.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I\u2019m no good at such things.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMe too, I hate doing such troublesome and detailed calculations.</p><br/><p>Rather, it\u2019s alright if I can fly!\u300d</p><br/><p>Certainly, the magic of the teleportation series can only jump to the point of a predestined location.</p><br/><p>If there is the image of the present location and the destination it is possible for the Spatial Transfer (Teleport) series, but there\u2019s still a need to calculate the correlation of the positional information correctly.</p><br/><p>It seems to be easy, but it\u2019s an unexpectedly difficult skill.</p><br/><p>As for Milim, she is someone who acts instinctively with her inborn intuition, however, she seems to be weak at deliberate calculation.</p><br/><p>Dagruel is obviously a muscle brain. As for Ramiris, oh well you know.</p><br/><p>It might be considerably useful to construct facilities for teleportation usage.</p><br/><p>Using this opportunity, I got the approval for my plan to install the teleportation magic formations at their places.</p><br/><p>At the parting,</p><br/><p>\u300cI entrust Chloe to you\u300d</p><br/><p>I was reminded as such by Leon.</p><br/><p>Not saying anything, I nod to say \u201cleave it to me\u201d.</p><br/><p>Leon seems to have understood, he returned a nod and left.</p><br/><p>As usual, it\u2019s a secret that I thought he\u2019s a pompous, attractive man.</p><br/><p>Thus, receiving the information beforehand, though the preparation period is short, there was approximately 3-4 weeks of time.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lords return to their territories and began to prepare for the Great War.</p><br/><p>[1] A Custom popular in Ancient World and in modern East Asia Countries, where instead of a hand signature, people gave their seal to mark documents.</p><br/><p>[2] *dum*dum*dum*dum*dum* Insert Terminator theme*</p><br/><p>[3]  Chounouryoku, super power or the more used term for it are ESP, supernatural power.</p><br/><p>[4] Like flash step and the like.

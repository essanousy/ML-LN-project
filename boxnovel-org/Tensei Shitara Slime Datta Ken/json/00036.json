Tension filled the air.</p><br/><p>Now, for the reconnaissance\u2026</p><br/><p>[Rimuru-sama, I shall go.]</p><br/><p>Souei immediately offered.</p><br/><p>He was not wearing any armor. Instead, he was wearing a chainmail woven from my steel thread.</p><br/><p>No questions about it\u2014it was built for agility.</p><br/><p>According to him, I won\u2019t be hit, so there\u2019s no need! Such were the smug and brisk words of this handsome guy.</p><br/><p>I see\u2026 I somehow managed to reply.</p><br/><p>This time too, I can entrust this mission to him with confidence.</p><br/><p>[Okay then, Souei. Go, confirm the situations for me.</p><br/><p> If possible, go check how good the ability of the pig boss is!]</p><br/><p>Saying so, I sent him out.</p><br/><p>Surely, he will discover many interesting things with his exceedingly high ability.</p><br/><p>[Rimuru-sama, would you mind if we rampage as we liked this time?]</p><br/><p>Benimaru had asked.</p><br/><p>Frankly, since I had no idea about the situation I couldn\u2019t say. Thus,</p><br/><p>[Hmm? I don\u2019t mind, but can you properly withdraw once I order the retreat?]</p><br/><p>So I say.</p><br/><p>Benimaru sported a fearless smile.</p><br/><p>[That signal, I think it would be unnecessary? After all, it will be annihilation! Won\u2019t it?]</p><br/><p>Such self confidence. You too, huh! So I thought.</p><br/><p>Good men are full of confidence, was it\u2026 if we win\u2026</p><br/><p>Was acting so smug but lost anyways! Were that to happen, the embarrassment would be intolerable.</p><br/><p>This guy probably doesn\u2019t worry about such things, right?</p><br/><p>Oh well.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t be careless, okay?]</p><br/><p>So I said, and ended the conversation with a shrug.</p><br/><p>Shion was entranced, admiring her sword. Soon she would be allowed to rampage as she like! Such a smile appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>Had she not been so ditzy, she\u2019d be the cool Shion.</p><br/><p>That girl, entranced with her sword, makes a really dangerous impression.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s act like we hadn\u2019t seen it, shall we. That\u2019s the best thing for my mental health.</p><br/><p>As expected from Hakurou, he was calm as usual.</p><br/><p>Or should I say: as bright and clean as a stainless mirror, truly a dignified presence that comes from a skilled person.</p><br/><p>However,</p><br/><p>[No opponents to sink my teeth in\u2026]</p><br/><p>He murmured, but my ears didn\u2019t not miss it.</p><br/><p>Seriously, I wonder if all Ogre people were this overconfident?</p><br/><p>They had lost once against the same opponent, so I\u2019d think they would be more wary in this situation.</p><br/><p>Such worries caused me to let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>But..... that my worries were completely unnecessary, was proven almost immediately later.</p><br/><p>2 hours later.</p><br/><p>(Would now be acceptable?)</p><br/><p>Confirming the battle formation, I received a telepathic message.</p><br/><p>(What? Did you find something?)</p><br/><p>(No, just a single Lizardman, is running in our direction)</p><br/><p>(What? Do you understand why?)</p><br/><p>(Yes, according to the information from the clones, the war has already begun in the marshes, although I had warned them not to act alone...)</p><br/><p>(Oh, is the one who leading them the Lizardmen name Gabil? That guy that was pointlessly overconfident....)</p><br/><p>(That is likely. What should I do regarding the lizardman?)</p><br/><p>Fumu. The war had already begun. But has the outcome been decided yet?</p><br/><p>Rather, maybe we made it in the nick of time. Need to confirm the state of battle from above.</p><br/><p>Well, about the Lizadman\u2026</p><br/><p>(Let\u2019s hear his story. Whether it was the decision of the Chief or not, we need to confirm their intentions.)</p><br/><p>(As you will!)</p><br/><p>I cut the connection.</p><br/><p>So, it had begun. I thought that we could enjoy a long awaited break but the circumstances seem to dictate otherwise.</p><br/><p>So addressing everyone,</p><br/><p>[Listen! The break\u2019s over. The war has begun</p><br/><p>From now on I will command from above!</p><br/><p> You guys follow my command, prepare yourself for war!]</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, everyone faces tighten.</p><br/><p>[Understood. For honor and glory!]</p><br/><p>Shion replies and Benimaru nods</p><br/><p>Hakurou casually walks forward.</p><br/><p>I sprout wings from my back. The wings open a hole in the clothes, but once the wings disappear, the hole would close.</p><br/><p>At my pleasure the clothing would change its form. A truly convenient ability.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s an order. I forbid you to die. This war is not a decisive battle. Make no mistake!]</p><br/><p>Hearing my words,</p><br/><p>[ [ [ Oooo~o~o~o~o !!!] ] ]</p><br/><p>They let out a battle cry.</p><br/><p>While nodding, I soar to the sky. </p><br/><p>From above, I observe the battle.</p><br/><p>What cannot be seen with naked eye alone is clearly visible with [Magic Perception].</p><br/><p>Almost as if you were observing with a satellite far beyond the clouds.</p><br/><p>The current situation was bad for the Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>Clearly, the situation had degraded to where they could not do anything and were surrounded.</p><br/><p>They somehow manage to hold the orcs back, which was caused, it seems, by the desperate encouragements from their commander. However, they clearly wouldn\u2019t last much longer.</p><br/><p>That commander looks familiar. It\u2019s Gabil. I had thought that he was just a fool, but it seems I had underestimated him.</p><br/><p>For a commander, it is fatal to not be able to see the bigger picture.</p><br/><p>However, no one would expect a young commander who lacks experience to properly observe the entire theatre.</p><br/><p>In any age and in any country, not every commander is an excellent one.</p><br/><p>Should he, however, survive and learn from this experience, he just might become an excellent one.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s pity for him to die here. So I thought. then issued orders.</p><br/><p>(Benimaru, hear my wish. First, the encircled Lizardmen. Help them!</p><br/><p>After that, do as you like. The details you will hear from Hakurou)</p><br/><p>Replying happily to my orders.</p><br/><p>(Understood! Is it okay if I go there with Ranga?)</p><br/><p>(I leave it to you!)</p><br/><p>Thus, I have begun to change the tides of war.</p><br/><p>In fact, above the clouds, thinking while observing the armies clash and being able to understand their every movement, gives me a sense of overwhelming superiority.</p><br/><p>I must also note that through \u201cThought Transmission\u201d, the aerial information can be transmitted to every soldier.....</p><br/><p>Information tactics of modern warfare can be implemented in a fantasy world..</p><br/><p>Unlike conventional armies, the amount of information provided is vastly different. With this, it is be possible even for an individual unit to maneuver well.</p><br/><p>Actually, this makes individual movement possible.</p><br/><p>When I was thus thinking, Souei called.</p><br/><p>(Rimuru-sama, apparently their flank was taken. The Chief\u2019s son, Gabil had caused a rebellion.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the Chief was confined in an underground chamber. </p><br/><p>They have also been attacked by the orcs, and anxiety spreads among their forces.)</p><br/><p>I see, so he was his son. Moreover, we shouldn\u2019t let anything happen to the Chief</p><br/><p>Thus I had an idea,</p><br/><p>(Souei, can you leap to the former Chief with shadow step?)</p><br/><p>So I ask him, since they met once, it should be possible.....</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s possible, shall I go now?)</p><br/><p>(I leave it to you. Assist the Chief, and do with the orcs in the caves as you please!)</p><br/><p>(I will! \u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbWould you have another minute?)</p><br/><p>Shadow step, let\u2019s practice that when the war ends. As I was thinking so, Souei called out.</p><br/><p>Seems like he had more to say.</p><br/><p>(What? Is there something else?)</p><br/><p>(Ay! The clones have reported suspicious monsters in every direction across the marshes\u2026</p><br/><p>They have decent magical power, high ranking individuals. How should I proceed?]</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>Could it be a trap? Even so, what kind of trap I\u2014we wouldn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>(How many have you confirmed?)</p><br/><p>(Yes! I able to confirm, 4 individuals. Unfortunately, there could be more. However, I don\u2019t feel any other auras.)</p><br/><p>(I see...... Is it possible to dispose of them?)</p><br/><p>(If doing it simultaneously, it may be possible with 2 clones\u2026 It may take time, but I can eliminate all of them!)</p><br/><p>Truly an outstanding guy.</p><br/><p>Somehow, I feel it\u2019s best to dispose of them simultaneously.... Just what are they\u2014that much is unclear.</p><br/><p>But, would killing them be bad? I don\u2019t know whether they are an enemy or not....</p><br/><p>(Two clones at the same time, is it possible to neutralize them without killing?)</p><br/><p>(Absolutely, it is possible)</p><br/><p>(Send me the information about their position. I will send Shion and Hakurou)</p><br/><p>(In that case, please have them contact me, we will neutralize the targets together.)</p><br/><p>(I entrust it to you)</p><br/><p>I told Shion and Hakurou about the situation.</p><br/><p>Absolutely no killing, just knock them out! I ordered.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know who they are, and I don\u2019t have any high class demon acquaintances.</p><br/><p>Since they stand in every direction, they are either scouts or setting traps. They seem to haven\u2019t noticed us, and are clearly not part of the Lizardmen\u2019s fighting strength.</p><br/><p>But this is too late for reconnaissance\u2026so are they from the Orc army?</p><br/><p>That also seems doubtful. Pointless, in my opinion.</p><br/><p>A third party? Suddenly, I thought that.</p><br/><p>Perhaps there are beings who are confirming the situation as we are.</p><br/><p>Well, if they are successfully captured, I will ask them then. I don\u2019t know if I can make them talk, but we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s unlikely that the demons came by the humans\u2019 orders, since they are rather antagonistic.</p><br/><p>Since thinking about it wouldn\u2019t help, I decided to stop.</p><br/><p>I issued orders and observed the situation.</p><br/><p>Lizardmen side had begun to succumb to pressure.</p><br/><p>They will surely fall soon. For all I know, the Chief was meeting a similar fate in the caverns.</p><br/><p>Souei already dispatched his clones, but I wonder if his main body is unaffected?</p><br/><p>My head as filled with many worries at this late hour.</p><br/><p>I issued an order, they followed it.</p><br/><p>Someone was incompetent if he takes more that he can do.</p><br/><p>Once, when I was still a rookie in the company, the Chief often got mad at me and said. Do not take more work than you can manage yourself!</p><br/><p>When the person in question stagnates, everyone will be affected.</p><br/><p>Since then, I avoided reckless action, always taking on only as much work as I knew I could handle.</p><br/><p>This time, the gifted one can\u2019t understand. They wouldn\u2019t know whether the job I gave them was possible.</p><br/><p>I pray that they are not incompetent. And, that they do not call me an incompetent lord.</p><br/><p>For now, I think I\u2019ll just continue to observe the situation.</p><br/><p>If they face trouble, I will immediately send help</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>Well,</p><br/><p>After finishing the telepathy, Souei wears a thin smile.</p><br/><p>He feels he was able to help his Lord.</p><br/><p>For Souei, Benimaru who is son of the lord was not his Lord.</p><br/><p>Similar of age, Souei treats him as a rival. Someday, he considered to serve under him, but it was not meant to be.</p><br/><p>Instead, they began to serve a lord named Rimuru.</p><br/><p>I am fortunate, he thought.</p><br/><p>A time of peace had continued for a while. Symbolizing strength, the Ogres had no opponent in the forest.</p><br/><p>Recently, even lesser dragons had not caused any commotions.</p><br/><p>He had thought that the peace was a good thing. However, they also wanted to use the skills they have obtained, such was their earnest wish.</p><br/><p>Then, they were attacked by the Orc army.</p><br/><p>He could do nothing at all, and left without avenging his lord and fallen comrades...</p><br/><p>I am fortunate, he thought.</p><br/><p>Under the new Lord, he was given the opportunity to avenge his former lord.</p><br/><p>Negligence born of pride. That he currently did not have.</p><br/><p>For the Lord, he had polished his technique (skill), all to eliminate his enemies.</p><br/><p>Being commanded filled him with the highest of pleasure.</p><br/><p>Souei calmly creates two clones of himself.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>(I will catch the two presences. Hakurou and Shion, go to south and west)</p><br/><p>Confirming using telepathy, they acknowledged his request.</p><br/><p>Each of the clones went to the north and east.</p><br/><p>He himself sunk into shadows and disappeared. He was going to meet up with the Lizardmen\u2019s Chief.</p><br/><p>The high class demons were not his enemies right now.</p><br/><p>He understands that much.</p><br/><p>After receiving Souei request, Hakurou and Shion exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>They nodded.</p><br/><p>[So, I guess I\u2019m off west.]</p><br/><p>[Very well, I am going south]</p><br/><p>After a short conversation, they run off.</p><br/><p>They disappear from the spot with high speed.</p><br/><p>Seeing their departure,</p><br/><p>[Can\u2019t be the last ones to leave!]</p><br/><p>The main force led by Benimaru began to move.</p><br/><p>Soundlessly like the wind, the Storm fanged wolves gallop into battle.</p><br/><p>The goblins ride in enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>They move in accordance to Rimuru\u2019s order. So extreme was their joy, that they felt their very blood dance in delight.</p><br/><p>You guys felt the same right.......</p><br/><p>Benimaru thought so, he was aware of his carefree personality.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, he remember the hesitation he felt when faced with the need to take over the Ogre tribe village Chief. Right now, however, he had no such choice.</p><br/><p>Thus, He liked his current position with Rimuru as the Lord he served.</p><br/><p>As one of the military commander, he merely wished to rampage to his heart\u2019s content.</p><br/><p>Had he become Chief, he could not ride off to battle thus. But now was different.</p><br/><p>He can participate without any concern.</p><br/><p>Benimaru sprints.</p><br/><p>He can\u2019t stop his blood from boiling.</p><br/><p> \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212</p><br/><p>Souei, Hakurou, Shion, had confirmed that they had arrived at their destinations.</p><br/><p>To prevent their presence from being noticed, they concealed themselves.</p><br/><p>In front of each of them, a suspicious demon was visible.</p><br/><p>They confirmed their observations, and found their opinions to match.</p><br/><p>This demon was a familiar of a High Devil which specialized in reconnaissance!</p><br/><p>Just in case, Souei conveyed to the two</p><br/><p>(I\u2019m going to report this to Rimuru-sama)</p><br/><p>Our lord would surely be troubled if suddenly beset by three reports.</p><br/><p>The two reluctantly agreed, as the one who with the best telepathy was Souei.</p><br/><p>Clumsy Shion was only good at receiving. She swore in heart to continue practicing.</p><br/><p>After receiving the two\u2019s permission,</p><br/><p>(Rimuru-sama, the presence of demons was confirmed. It is familiar of a High Devil, which specialized in reconnaissance, are you sure you want to capture them?</p><br/><p>In my opinion, that we killed them will not be discovered, so there is no cause for further concern!)</p><br/><p>To Rimuru, he sent such a message with telepathy.</p><br/><p>I leave it to you! So was the response.</p><br/><p>With the other two discussing the timing, they decided to simultaneously eliminate the four scouts.</p><br/><p>Hakurou would signal.</p><br/><p>At the same time as Hakurou commands,</p><br/><p>His slash gleaming, the monster before Hakurou is cut down and disappears.</p><br/><p>As if sucked into the shadows, as if consumed by the ground\u2026 two more demons are crushed. Souei\u2019s kills.</p><br/><p>After one thunderous slash, the demon was blown away without a trace.... Shion\u2019s target.</p><br/><p>All happened within the same second.</p><br/><p>The slash that Shion had put all her strength into, after blowing the demon away, lost none of its momentum and continued onward.</p><br/><p>So great was the momentum, that it had reached the outskirts of the marshes and cut down many orcs.</p><br/><p>And that attack signaled Rimuru\u2019s participation in battle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

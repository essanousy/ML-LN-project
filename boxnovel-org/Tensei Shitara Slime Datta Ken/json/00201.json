But it could be said that he had succeeded in gathering enough information.</p><br/><p>For Claude, his utmost priority was to bring his intel to his master Leon, whom he has pledged his allegiance to, even at the risk of his life.</p><br/><p>And his wish came true, Leon has now learned it all.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell done.\u300d</p><br/><p>Two words.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a disappointing response. However, for Claude, those words were priceless.</p><br/><p>\u300cThose words are more than I deserve\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Claude became overwhelmed with emotion.</p><br/><p>However, he understood that it is not the time to be immersed in emotion.</p><br/><p>And that is the same for Leon too.</p><br/><p>The intel from Claude was more detailed than what Demon Lord Rimuru had explained at the Walpurgis.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes this mean Demon Lord Rimuru is trying to steal the march over the other Demon Lords?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leon couldn\u2019t throw away such a doubt, but he judged that that was not the whole truth.</p><br/><p>There was no contradiction between Rimuru\u2019s and Claude\u2019s information, his doubt about the exaggeration of the enemy forces was cleared up.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, it can be said that the enemy has gigantic war potential.</p><br/><p>\u300cClaude, do you think that we can oppose them right now?\u300d</p><br/><p>The Black Knight Claude is the strongest knight among Leon\u2019s subordinates so he sensed some value in Claude\u2019s opinion.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m afraid\u2026\u2026 I need to express my honest thoughts.</p><br/><p>As the difference in the number of this side and that side is great, perhaps, at best we can oppose an army of 50.000 angels assuming we devote ourselves to defense.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, if we tried to attack outside the city barrier\u2026\u2026 defeat may very well be inevitable\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do you mean!? Claude-dono, we would be defeated?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe are Leon-sama\u2019s strongest knights. As if we would be beaten by the angels!\u300d</p><br/><p>Each leader of the magic knights got angry by Claude\u2019s remark.</p><br/><p>But, Leon suppressed them.</p><br/><p>Leon closed his eyes and begin thinking. He thought that Claude\u2019s statement was correct.</p><br/><p>Even if he compared it simply based on the war potential, aside from the knight leader class who are on pseudo-Demon Lord class, the best that the normal knights could do would be fight against several angels.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the angels who absorbed the people of the mixed corps that Claude affiliated with before may have fighting power which exceed A rank.</p><br/><p>If the angel army, which only consists of such special individuals came, then his side would have the lesser war potential and numbers.</p><br/><p>He could agree to the prediction, defeat would be inevitable.</p><br/><p>(Do I have no choice but to strengthen the barrier and go out and attack myself? But, that\u2019s a really bad move\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Leon is thinking.</p><br/><p>He figured that the chance of victory was low in the case that his subordinates clashed with Kagali.</p><br/><p>After all, she seems to have fused with an angel of Seraphim class who has energy rivaling that of an awakened Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s Kagali, who was the former Demon Lord Kazaream who had lived for several hundred years, it be no wonder even if she obtained the ability that can rival an awakened Demon Lord. Perhaps, there\u2019s a possibility that she is better than that, or so Leon thinks.</p><br/><p>In that case, there\u2019s no other choice but for him to fight......</p><br/><p>(But in that case, the preparation against the angel army itself is tough, right?)</p><br/><p>That is the problem.</p><br/><p>If he goes to fight by himself, Leon believes that he wouldn\u2019t get defeated even if his opponent is Kagali, but at the same time he predicted that Claude and Co wouldn\u2019t be able to oppose the angel army.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, in the case that his fight with Kagali dragged on, there is a possibility that he would get attacked from the rear by the angel army after they destroyed his country.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be a problem if he is able to deal with Kagali quickly, but that would be an optimistic outlook.</p><br/><p>After all, Kagali knows of Leon\u2019s trump card; Ultimate Skill\u300ePurity Lord Metatron\u300f.</p><br/><p>It was a big mistake for Leon to let Kagali and Yuuki escape when he fought them before..</p><br/><p>The tab now falls on Leon.</p><br/><p>When Leon opened his eyes, he surveyed his subordinates.</p><br/><p>The chief knight, Silver Knight Alrose.</p><br/><p>The strongest knight, Black Knight Claude.</p><br/><p>And, each knight leader who leads the four knight orders.</p><br/><p>Red Knight Order\u2026 Magic Knights skillful in offensive magic belong to this order.</p><br/><p> 4,000 members. The leader is the Red Knight Fran. A woman.</p><br/><p>Blue Knight Order\u2026 Magic Knights skillful in support magic belong to this order.</p><br/><p> 2.000 members. The leader is the Blue Knight Oxishan. A man.</p><br/><p>Yellow Knight Order\u2026 Magic Knights skillful in defensive magic belong to this order.</p><br/><p> 3.000 members. The leader is the Yellow Knight Kizna. A woman.</p><br/><p>White Knight Order\u2026 Magic knights skillful in recovery magic belong to this order.</p><br/><p> 1.000 members. The leader is the White Knight Maetel. A woman.</p><br/><p>Those six people were the strongest of the magic knights.</p><br/><p>They are people capable of defeating something along the lines of an Arc Demon.</p><br/><p>As for Fran, she has matured into a person who can handle stronger magic as she has experienced \u201cdeath\u201d once.</p><br/><p>They are a lineup of people who would not look inferior even if compared with the other Demon Lords\u2019 armies\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(There might be a chance for victory if I order all of them to go fight and die. But\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>\u2018Go and die!\u2019 if he ordered such, Leon knew that they would sacrifice their bodies for him with pleasure.</p><br/><p>However, that\u2019s why, it is an order he will never be able to give.</p><br/><p>Then, what he needs to do\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cLeon-sama, a guest seems to have arrived.\u300d</p><br/><p>The clear voice of a woman reported to Leon, who was in his thoughts.</p><br/><p>It is Kizna who is skillful in defensive magic, she perceived some people had trespassed the barrier.</p><br/><p>And so, his problem would be settled instantly, by the intruders\u2019 arrival.</p><br/><p>The one who came was Mizari, the demon subordinate of Guy Crimson,</p><br/><p>And, for Leon, she brought a shocking proposal.</p><br/><p>\u300cLeon-sama, I'm terribly sorry to bother you after the Walpurgis.</p><br/><p>On this occasion, I received the will of my master Demon Lord Guy Crimson and came here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s cooperate for the Great War!\u2019 is the message I\u2019m told to pass to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>With a respectful bow, Mizari informed Leon.</p><br/><p>Leon looked at Mizari.</p><br/><p>She kneeled before his eyes, and bowed her head to Leon.</p><br/><p>But, the impression he got from Mizari was stronger compared to before.</p><br/><p>He can feel that her power has increased greatly.</p><br/><p>She interacted humbly with Leon because he is a friend of Guy, but her ability seems to have come to rival an awakened Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>(What exactly happened?)</p><br/><p>He had that question, but he considered it reassuring since they\u2019re not hostile with each other.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s cooperation from Mizari, opposing Kagali might be possible.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. I guess it\u2019s no use to keep putting on airs.</p><br/><p>Honestly, I\u2019m saved. But, is Guy\u2019s defense, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt would be disrespectful for the likes of me to worry about that personage\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Besides, Hirari is still there.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, that is true.\u300d</p><br/><p>Certainly, it is unnecessary to worry about Guy who is the strongest in the first place.</p><br/><p>To Leon who nodded, Mizari offered a proposal.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Leon-sama, here is a proposal, would you like to hear it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, actually\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Mizari raised her face and with a sweet smile, she told Leon.</p><br/><p>\u300cWill you fuses your 6 colored knights with our 6 demon generals using the forbidden secret art?\u300d</p><br/><p>Mizari asked such, grew an evil smile suitable for a demon.</p><br/><p>The place was thrown into a commotion.</p><br/><p>The 6 demon generals are the arc demons brought along by Mizari.</p><br/><p>It is not to the extent of calling them demon dukes, but Leon was able to perceive that they have power incomparable to the usual arc demons who accept summonings.</p><br/><p>It could be said, as expected of Guy\u2019s subordinates. Perhaps, Leon\u2019s top 6 subordinates\u2015\u2015as Mizari says, the 6 color knights\u2015\u2015 might be equal to them.</p><br/><p>They were formidable demons, it would be difficult to say which one is superior, the knights or the demons.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is your intention?\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon asked.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will say it honestly.</p><br/><p>I believe that individuals with power only at the Arch Demon level won\u2019t be very useful in the Great War beyond this point.\u300d</p><br/><p>Mizari declared such.</p><br/><p>Alrose and Co got angry from her words which implied that they were useless.</p><br/><p>However, two of them, Claude and Fran, understood the meaning of Mizari\u2019s remark.</p><br/><p>It is true, they are weak.</p><br/><p>Even Alrose who is the chief knight wouldn\u2019t be able to compete with just one of Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s subordinates after all.</p><br/><p>That oni woman called Shion is not even the strongest among Rimuru\u2019s subordinates. It\u2019s certain that she is one of the high ranking executives, but in reality there\u2019s others above her.</p><br/><p>Claude pacified Alrose and Co who were enraged. Then, he urged Mizari to continue.</p><br/><p>Returning the favor with a bow, Mizari continued explaining.</p><br/><p>\u300cWill this be alright?</p><br/><p>Hirari and I had awakened as Devil Lords due to Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s \u201dSecret Art of Evolution\u201d.</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, we can only spread a trifling amount of that gift to our followers.</p><br/><p>I think that is because of the fact that we couldn\u2019t make a soul bond between us.</p><br/><p>Even though they are individuals close to being independent demons, they are connected to us.</p><br/><p>Because of this, I expect these ones may not be able to evolve further.</p><br/><p>Therefore, using the forbidden \u201cSecret Art: Human-Demon Soul Fusion\u201d, I want to perform a reset for all of their relationships.</p><br/><p>I want them to throw away their current bodies and dwell in new bodies.</p><br/><p>It will fail if it is with a low-ranking individual, but there\u2019s a possibility of success if it is with individuals at the arc demon class.</p><br/><p>Besides, the success rate jumps up if it\u2019s with people at the same level.</p><br/><p>As for the demerit, one of the consciousness will vanish.</p><br/><p>As for the merit, a stronger individual will be born from the unification of two beings.</p><br/><p>They will reincarnate as an existence of demon duke class, a class which surpasses the former Demon Lords!\u300d</p><br/><p>Mizari finished her explanation loudly.</p><br/><p>Silence descended on the room.</p><br/><p>The demons having consented to it, are waiting calmly.</p><br/><p>Alrose and the other knight leaders digested the words that had just been spoken and had a discussion.</p><br/><p>They want power.</p><br/><p>However, naturally it\u2019s not something obtained in one day.</p><br/><p>If they\u2019re not able to impact the fight against the angel army with their current power, it would be better to accept the proposal.</p><br/><p>However, in the case that their consciousnesses got swallowed up, that\u2019d be more terrible than death itself.</p><br/><p>Yet, even so\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cLeon-sama, I wish to accept this proposal.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMe too.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Alrose reported such, everyone else agreed simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Needless to say, Claude and Fran had resolved themselves after hearing Mizari\u2019s talk.</p><br/><p>\u300cLeon-sama, if by any chance, we lose against the demons, at that time, I ask for your forgiveness\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>As the representative of the 6 people, Claude told Leon so.</p><br/><p>Leon closed his eyes and remained silent.</p><br/><p>Then,</p><br/><p>\u300cI will not tolerate it. All of you must win. You all must acquire the demons\u2019 power and then continue serving me.\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon muttered calmly after a brief time passed.</p><br/><p>Leon\u2019s words show that he has accepted Mizari\u2019s proposal.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cWe swear to meet your expectations!!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Alrose, Claude and the other members lowered their heads all at once and swore to Leon.</p><br/><p>Thus, Mizari\u2019s proposal was accepted.</p><br/><p>The ceremony was held.</p><br/><p>The 6 demon generals and the 6 color knights stood in a row and faced each other.</p><br/><p>Each of them faced and observed their partner who had similar abilities to themselves.</p><br/><p>The ones who lose will be swallowed by their partner. Tense expressions appeared on the knights\u2019 faces.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the demons remained calm.</p><br/><p>For the demons, they only need to carry out the orders they received. They don\u2019t feel any need to become eager whatsoever.</p><br/><p>And then, the time came.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, the \u201cSecret Art: Human-Demon Soul Fusion\u201d shall now begin.\u300d</p><br/><p>At the same time Mizari that declared such, the demon generals converted their physical bodies into energy.</p><br/><p>The secret art is possible because the demons are spiritual life-forms.</p><br/><p>And, when the knights confirmed it, it occurred.</p><br/><p>Mizari suddenly cut the cores of the demon generals with a single blow.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have certainly witnessed the resolution of all of you.</p><br/><p>Now then, please receive it!</p><br/><p>The gift from Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</p><br/><p>Please acquire your new power without holding back.</p><br/><p>Your desire shall become your power.</p><br/><p>Let us pray that you all can obtain more power!\u300d</p><br/><p>Mizari shouted.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, everything was planned from the beginning.</p><br/><p>If they challenged the ritual without fearing the loss of themselves, the demons were ordered to give their power to them.</p><br/><p>Guy\u2019s orders are absolute, nobody defies them.</p><br/><p>After all, since their evolution had stopped, they understood that there is no other way to obtain further strength than this method.</p><br/><p>However, in the case that the knights were afraid of obtaining new power, the demons were authorized to take the leadership in the fusion.</p><br/><p>\u300cWha! What happened!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh knights, fear not. We had all agreed to be absorbed by you.</p><br/><p>As ordered by our great Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</p><br/><p>All of you have shown us your determination.</p><br/><p>Thus we have acknowledged that you all are the suitable entities to be entrusted with our power!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, all of you had better be quick, since our cores are already destroyed.</p><br/><p>There is no time to spare until we are no more, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Persuaded by the demons, the surprised knights who had come to a stop, began to move again.</p><br/><p>They each fused the demon\u2019s power with their own.</p><br/><p>Thus the ceremony finished.</p><br/><p>They succeeded the ceremony of \u201cSecret Art: Human-Demon Soul Fusion\u201d safely without losing anyone.</p><br/><p>Thus, the six knights had obtained the power of demon duke class.</p><br/><p>The preparations on Leon\u2019s side finished without a hitch.</p><br/><p>And, the decisive battle was going to begin soon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

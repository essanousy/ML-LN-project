Since they had no soul, they were merely a substitute Artificial Intelligence for combat. This certainly could be said as a deed of violating the dead.</p><br/><p>Velda looked at the demons who got angry and without his expression changing ordered\u300cEliminate the hindrances\u300d.</p><br/><p>And so, the fight had begun.</p><br/><p>Ultima exchanged blows with Damrada.</p><br/><p>Carrera and Kondou aimed their guns at each other in a short range.</p><br/><p>The battles between the two pairs were intense, but the match clearly showed who\u2019s superior in an instant.</p><br/><p>Bloody Bite which unleashed by Ultima was parried by Damrada without being overpowered by it.</p><br/><p>Just a few words,</p><br/><p>\u300cMy technique, is it? It seems you have inherited it splendidly but\u2026\u2026 if the skill is the same, naturally what decides the outcome is the difference in power between us.\u300d</p><br/><p>Damrada uttered his impression.</p><br/><p>And then, he pierced through Ultima\u2019s chest whose stance was broken with his crushing fist[2].</p><br/><p>He refined enormous energy and assimilated it with his fighting spirit, and concentrated it on his fist. And then, the mass of unleashed fighting spirit caused explosive destructive power.</p><br/><p>While coiled around like a snake, it devoured the inside of Ultima\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Ultima was conscious but she couldn\u2019t move her body. Because she\u2019s a demon which is a spiritual life-form, she lost the control of the body because the flow of energy was devoured.</p><br/><p>No, if this happened on someone with a physical body, they might not be able to endure it and have their insides collapse and explode\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Carrera likewise fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>They had fast drawn their guns at extreme speed and simultaneously fired their bullets, but the power discrepancy was too great.</p><br/><p>The bullets fired from Carrera\u2019s large caliber handgun collided head-on with the bullets fired from Kondou\u2019s automatic handgun. The bullets which are refined energy bullets, due to the difference in energy density, one side\u2019s had their bullets burst and disappeared. The bullets that Carrera fired had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cWha!?\u300d</p><br/><p>By the time she was surprised, it was after a large amount of energy had been deprived from Carrera\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Ultima and Carrera, those two who rivaled or surpassed even an awakened demon lord, were easily defeated just like taking candy from a baby.</p><br/><p>While confronting Velda, Milim was observing the fight with side glances.</p><br/><p>(Energy comparable to 10 awakened demon lords, hum? It seems he wasn\u2019t just bragging about it.)</p><br/><p>So, she quickly concluded.</p><br/><p>She realized that the demons had no chance for winning against Kondou and Damrada from their exchanges just now.</p><br/><p>Then, what would she do, Milim had no other choice but to throw her hands up.</p><br/><p>Moreover\u2026\u2026 She was concerned about the third memory orb Velda had.</p><br/><p>Although the energy that filled up the heavens had almost disappeared entirely just by Velda creating Kondou and Damrada, if he brought forth someone whom rivaled those two, their chance of winning would be gone.</p><br/><p> (This is very bad. I didn\u2019t expect it, for him to really have strength surpassing \u201cTrue Dragons\u2026\u2026 it seems my thoughts are a bit na\u00efve.)</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, Milim thought that if Velda had so much power, regardless of whether she did it alone or carefully made a plan and challenged him with everyone, there wouldn\u2019t be much of difference anyway.</p><br/><p>The only thing Milim could do was to unleash all her power to crush Velda.</p><br/><p>Milim prepared to fire a full power Drago Nova while kneading fighting spirit inside her body.</p><br/><p>Milim had not given up yet.</p><br/><p>She believed that the possibility of her defeating Velda wasn\u2019t zero if she could land an attack on him.</p><br/><p>However, she had no choice but to admit that it was very difficult to penetrate Velda\u2019s guards\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Two of the demons were defeated and Testarossa left alone wouldn\u2019t be able to stop Kondou and Damrada.</p><br/><p>It was a very disadvantageous situation.</p><br/><p>However, even so\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Milim kept analyzing the situation calmly.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell now, Milim. It\u2019s about time for you to give up and be obedient. No matter how you struggle, you understand that you have no odds of winning, do you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHumph. Say whatever you want. If you wanted a child, you should have made one with that insolent person who called herself my mother. Although she met a foolish end.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t misunderstand it, Milim. What I wanted is not really a child. The only one who stands next to Velda is Lucia. I thought that I could recreate\u300eKnowledge Lord Raphael\u300f if I granted it a physical body and name but\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, as expected, it seems the manas created from\u300eJustice Lord Michael\u300fcouldn\u2019t become Lucia\u2019s soul. It\u2019s a disappointment for you too, right? If only I could reproduce\u300eKnowledge Lord Raphael\u300f that Lucia previous had, it can be said that reviving the soul that created the skill is possible. If I succeed that far, I only need to plant memories to the soul again. It can be said as a reverse process of a soul creating the skill but\u2026\u2026 it seems to be more difficult than I thought. It was the most probable method though\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda answered Milim\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>His thoughts were nothing but crazy as he talked about a method that could be said as taboo.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard, in order to revive my mother\u2026\u2026 you created the memory orb?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, so what? Even spreading fear, panic, and chaos to the world to destroy humanity was nothing more because of my wishful thinking, \"it would be great if someone awakened with it under such circumstances.\u201d It would be rational for me to seek a more certain method, right? Reviving a soul is very difficult, but if the same skill can be created, the characteristics can be said pretty similar. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for Ultimate Skill\u300eKnowledge Lord Raphael\u300fto be created.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard, such a\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim was made speechless.</p><br/><p>She tried to deny it, but she had realized that there was a slight possibility in that method.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, well, I didn\u2019t think that it would fail, even though I granted Michael the body I had preserved. Moreover, I ended up losing the precious body, this was a failure. So, as the last resort, I think that me making a child with you will be the most certain way. If it\u2019s you who is Lucia\u2019s daughter, wouldn\u2019t you able to give birth to a body similar in terms of DNA? With just a bit of tampering, I can change it to the same body as the original Lucia.\u300d[3]</p><br/><p>With a clear and serene smile, Velda informed the method dyed with madness to Milim.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are crazy\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? But, you see, Milim\u2026\u2026 no matter what you are thinking, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u300d</p><br/><p>And, for an instant, Velda disappeared and Milim received an impact on her abdomen.</p><br/><p>Although she took a defensive stance right away, Velda\u2019s fist easily broke through her\u300eMultiple Barrier\u300f, and the fighting spirit she kneaded with a lot of efforts ended up dispersed.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Milim was thrown to the ground.</p><br/><p>Although she tried to stand up, her body couldn\u2019t muster any strength in contrast to her will.</p><br/><p>(Kuhaa, he is\u2026\u2026certainly, strong\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>Milim glared at Velda while keeping her consciousness by adjusting her fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see you\u2019re still resisting, Milim. I\u2019ll be your opponent after I destroyed the world, so I want you to sleep for a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>While saying those words, Velda focused energy on his fist and held up his hand to Milim.</p><br/><p>And then, lights were overflowing from his hand\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Testarossa accurately analyzed the current situation and judged that her chance of winning was 0.</p><br/><p>Her result was more pessimistic than the conclusion Milim had, but that was because Testarossa didn\u2019t possess any trump card.</p><br/><p>Since the two demons of the same rank as her were defeated instantly, the result could be seen no matter how hard she tried.</p><br/><p>Given the situation, there was only one way that Testarossa could do.</p><br/><p>(Good grief. I didn\u2019t expect that Velda is such an existence. However, well, we had accomplished the supreme command we received from Rimuru-sama to break the heaven gate, it could be said the plan is a success. If it\u2019s Rimuru-sama, he would have started with the next plan I guess, so I should earn some more time\u2015\u2015\uff09</p><br/><p>Since she would lose even if she fought, there was no other way but to earn time by conversation.</p><br/><p>For Testarossa, death wasn\u2019t something to be afraid of. After hundreds of years, or even after thousands of years, it would be possible for her regenerate with some of her memories and ego. But, when she thought that the comrades she knew might not exist in that era, she felt a bit lonely\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(Fufu, that\u2019s funny. For me to feel lonely\u2026\u2026 Is this what they called a sentiment, I wonder? Well, whatever\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Testarossa switched her thoughts and began to stall for time by verbal attacks.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere is no feelings and no souls either. You two are moving sophisticatedly for a hollow doll. However, it\u2019s hilarious\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Testarossa said those words pompously, watching for their reaction.</p><br/><p>Talking like this would be meaningless if their memories were just reproduced, but Damrada and Kondou had their memories altered. Testarossa was aiming at the inconsistency in it and saw their reaction.</p><br/><p>Although those two were like robots without emotions, \u201cWon\u2019t they get confused due to the inconsistencies as they are precise machines?\u201d so Testarossa had such a prediction.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilarious\u2026\u2026? What do you mean, young lady?\u300d</p><br/><p>Damrada asked calmly.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the one who answered was not Testarossa, but Kondou.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s simple. This demon (Carrera) seems to have taken over my ability\u2015\u2015even my soul. But, I don\u2019t have memories of it. The person I have given my soul to is hostile against Velda-sama with some kind of goal. Guessing from the circumstances, it would be natural to think that some part of my memories was inconveniently rewritten. Don\u2019t you think so too, Damrada?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015that\u2019s, isn\u2019t it possible that our souls were stolen?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo. I won\u2019t allow such unsightly conduct.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kondou declared confidently.</p><br/><p>Damrada also nodded. Although he said it himself, he understood that it was an unlikely thing to happen.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015I, I guess so. This girl had succeeded my techniques and used it perfectly after all\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Damrada agreed to Kondou\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>Testarossa looked at Kondou with a slightly surprised expression.</p><br/><p>Because Testarossa was impressed by Kondou who had analyzed and explained the current situation perfectly in such a short time since he was created.</p><br/><p>(This man is frighteningly calm. There are things that only Carrera acknowledges\u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>However, at the same time, Testarossa realized from looking at Kondou\u2019s clear eyes that even if she thrust many contradictions to him, he wouldn\u2019t be confused or change sides.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, does it matter? Don\u2019t worry about it, Damrada. We just need to carry out the mission given by Velda-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>As Testarossa thought, the man reproduced from Kondou\u2019s memories pointed the muzzle of his gun towards Testarossa without hesitation in his eyes.</p><br/><p>(Hmph. I thought that I would able to earn slightly more time, but it was meaningless, I guess. Rimuru-sama, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re dead. Please\u2015\u2015give us your forgiveness\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>Testarossa stood proudly till the end.</p><br/><p>Her mouth took the shape of a crescent moon and sprouted a charming smile.</p><br/><p>Although she did everything she could, she concluded that it seemed that she ran out of time. However, rather than given up, she concentrated her consciousness in order to activate the Secret Technique of Reincarnation[4] with her strong will and pride as the strongest Devil Lord in her heart.</p><br/><p>However, the Secret Technique of Reincarnation was never activated. That was because it was no longer necessary.</p><br/><p>The last struggle Testarossa had done was not pointless.</p><br/><p>One shot was fired.</p><br/><p>Kondou\u2019s bullet was strong enough to annihilate even a Devil Lord whom surpassed awakened demon lords as it housed overwhelming killing intent that wouldn\u2019t allow evasion or defense. Exactly at the moment when the assassin\u2019s bullet broke through Testarossa\u2019s\u300eMultiple Barrier\u300f\u2015\u2015 </p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. Testarossa, you\u2019re not permitted to die without permission. Rimuru-sama will be angry, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>The bullet was stopped exactly in front of Testarossa.</p><br/><p>A smiling Diablo suddenly appeared and stood next to Testarossa, while holding the bullet with his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u300cDiablo, you were late you know? I didn\u2019t plan to die, but it was just one step before I got annihilated, you know.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu, excuse me then. However, didn\u2019t you gals proceed without permission after destroying the heaven gate?\u300d</p><br/><p>Testarossa lightly shrugged her shoulders to Diablo\u2019s inquiry and changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, may I leave those two to you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m afraid to say, it might be hard for me alone. However, there\u2019s no need to worry. Because it isn\u2019t just me who came to this place after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCould it be, Rimuru-sama too!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo. It looks like Rimuru-sama will come after the removal of the flying insects is confirmed. Therefore, I wanted everything to be over until then though\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Diablo looked at Damrada and Kondou and smiled wryly.</p><br/><p>He glanced to look at Velda who fired lights towards Milim.</p><br/><p>\u300cKufufufufu. As expected, they\u2019re fast. It seemed those people have arrived. However, everything is going as planned, I suppose\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat?\u300d</p><br/><p>Immediately after Testarossa responded to Diablo\u2019s mutter, an explosion occurred centered on the place where Milim was.</p><br/><p>Kondou withdrew to the rear while being cautious of Diablo and Damrada also moved instantly in front of Velda to protect his master with his body as a shield.</p><br/><p>Looking at the unexpected explosion, Velda slightly clicked his tongue and grumbled \u300cMore hindrances are coming\u2026\u2026\u300d.</p><br/><p>\u300cSee? Because you gals are slow in breaking the gate, other people have arrived. Although I would have been defeated by myself, so I won\u2019t complain only for this time.\u300d</p><br/><p>The people Velda grumbled as hindrances and the other people Diablo mentioned were needless to say\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Appeared besides and in front of Milim were figures of five people\u2015\u2015 Guy and Chloe, also the three \u201cTrue Dragons\u201d.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Velda glanced at Guy and the others unpleasantly.</p><br/><p>And then, he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300cGeez. Because you came together with everyone, does this mean you\u2019re going against me? Hey, Velzard?\u300d</p><br/><p>Instead of Veldora and Velgrind who he couldn\u2019t connect his thoughts with, Velda questioned Velzard who had been under his control in order to ascertain her intention.</p><br/><p>\u300cSilence. You\u2019re an imposter who impersonates my Aniue. Now that you mention it, why did I ended up thinking that a bastard like you is my Aniue\u2026....\u300d</p><br/><p>Velzard cut down Velda\u2019s question and clearly showed her hostile intention to him.</p><br/><p>Velda\u2019s domination on her had already been lifted off by Guy and lost its effect, now, there were no more gaps inside her heart to be taken advantaged by control type ability.</p><br/><p>, Velda sighed and shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>He annoyingly said\u300cYou all really are troublesome\u300d, and his mouth curled wickedly as he thought of something good.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, I shall call out a person you all dearly missed. I\u2019m kind after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>While speaking so, he took out the last memory orb from his pocket.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs if I will let you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Guy reacted to Milim\u2019s shout and unsheathed his sword with great speed to attack Velda.</p><br/><p>While evading the attack easily, Velda said\u300cYou\u2019re too slow.\u300d and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, it seems the angels below have been destroyed just at the right time. Energy started to fill up the heaven. With this, it looks like I can create the strongest one with all the power left from the angels. All of you are excited too, right? Enjoy the reunion you all yearn as much as possible!\u300d</p><br/><p>And then\u2015\u2015 a human was created.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is this place? Or rather, what happened to yours truly?\u300d</p><br/><p>Velgrind turned pale when she saw that person. Guy and Velzard too.</p><br/><p>The reason why was that person was Guy\u2019s best friend and the subject of Velzard\u2019s jealously. And also, he was Velgrind\u2019s partner.</p><br/><p>That person\u2019s name is Rudra Nasca.</p><br/><p>He was the Rudra Nasca who had the memories of his prime when he was still the strongest.</p><br/><p>The energy leaked out of the destroyed angels from the surface flowing into the heaven and formed Rudra\u2019s body. It was a tremendous dense energy which easily surpassed Kondou and Damrada who were created earlier.</p><br/><p>Velda\u2019s trump card who foresaw the defeat on the surface was now manifested its form.</p><br/><p>Three people stood like protecting Velda.</p><br/><p>Damrada and Kondou were on his left and right with Rudra in the center.</p><br/><p>Confronting them were Guy, Milim and the three \u201cTrue Dragons\u201d. There was also Chloe and Diablo.</p><br/><p>Testarossa retrieved Ultima and Carrera and treated them. She judged calmly that participating in the fight would be pointless because the level of the fight had reached another dimension.</p><br/><p>From Testarossa, she could only pray for Diablo and the others\u2019 victory.</p><br/><p>However, it was like Testarossa didn\u2019t have any feelings of anxiety and fear.</p><br/><p>What could be seen from her eyes was the color of interest.</p><br/><p>(Even so\u2026\u2026 that Diablo, he stands side by side with those at the top.)</p><br/><p>Even Testarossa had no other choice but to admit that those people were called the pinnacles of this world.</p><br/><p>Testarossa nodded satisfyingly as she saw her colleague calmly stand beside those people without feeling timid.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of defeat.</p><br/><p>She would even overcome death.</p><br/><p>And then, she decided that someday\u2015\u2015 they would climb and reached the top too.</p><br/><p>And now\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Each of them ascertained their prey and the fight began.</p><br/><p>[1]  Ch\u014dj\u014d kessen.

How may I help you?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Oh, hello. I am currently doctor\u2019s patient; I have an appointment next week Thursday, at 11.</p><br/><p>Receptionist: Yes, I found you on file. Would you like to confirm or reschedule?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: I would like to cancel. I will be switching doctors.</p><br/><p>Receptionist: I see, I\u2019ll let the doctor know.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Clown (Phone Call): Hello?</p><br/><p>Receptionist: Ah! I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve answered. We spoke just a few minutes ago about cancelling the appointment. The doctor wants to have one last session with you so that we can properly dispose of the file.</p><br/><p>Clown: I see\u2026</p><br/><p>Receptionist: Could you come in tomorrow at noon?</p><br/><p>Clown: Yes, of course! By the way\u2026</p><br/><p>Receptionist: Yes?</p><br/><p>Clown: Have you heard? A famous surgeon went on a safari in Africa. When he came back, his colleagues asked him how it had been. \u2018Oh, it was very disappointing,\u2019 he said. \u2018I didn\u2019t kill a thing. I\u2019d have been better off staying here in the hospital.\u2019</p><br/><p>Receptionist: A joke, huh\u2026?</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Some notes: I finished the chapter with a headache, so expect errors. We now have a translator working on this project translating it into German\u2013if you\u2019re following us, do expect to get those posts as well. I looked around trying to see if I could have them sent only to some people, but to no avail. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.</p><br/><p>Life in the Royal Capital</p><br/><p>058. The Summoned ~ those who are called heroes ~</p><br/><p>The children directed a hostile gaze at me.</p><br/><p>Filled with pure hatred.</p><br/><p>It made me feel really out of place.</p><br/><p>What in the world could cause them to harbor so much hostility towards a new instructor?</p><br/><p>Five children.</p><br/><p>Misaki Kenya: Male, 8 years old</p><br/><p>Sekiguchi Ryouta: Male, 8 years old</p><br/><p>Gale Gibson: Male, 9 years old</p><br/><p>Alice Rondo: Female, 7 years old</p><br/><p>Chloe O\u2019Bell: Female, 8 years old</p><br/><p>None of them are older than 10.</p><br/><p>I look them over while confirming the notes I picked up in the staff room.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve been picked up from all over the world. Each one was called a monster.</p><br/><p>Each country has requested a subjugation for them, but the adventurers took custody of them instead.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what the documents said, but something is bothering me.</p><br/><p>Why are their ages so similar? And, they\u2019ve all been picked up in various circumstances from countries surrounding the Jura Forest?</p><br/><p>Moreover, within three years of each other? There might be something going on.</p><br/><p>They seem to have grown very attached to Shizu-san. Other than her, they only listen to Yuuki\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Well, unless you see them for yourself you wouldn\u2019t know how mischievous this bunch really is.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, what\u2019s with the sudden aggression, brats!</p><br/><p>I (Ore-sama) will be your instructor from now on; the name\u2019s Rimuru.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not as nice as Shizu-san, so prepare yourselves!\u300d</p><br/><p>I thought to start with a greeting, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cShut up! You won\u2019t deceive us!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, right! Even if we listen, you\u2019ll just kill us anyways!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you do with Shizu-san! Did you kill her too?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, we won\u2019t trust an adult!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019ll just dispose of us, saying that we\u2019re good for nothing, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmm? What\u2019s with their response?</p><br/><p>This is not at the level of classroom disruption. They are not just bratty\u2013that\u2019s real killing intent right there.</p><br/><p>I mean, how did they even think that we\u2019re trying to kill them, or that we killed Shizu san?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s something else at work here.</p><br/><p>That day, we couldn\u2019t continue the lesson.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know their circumstances, so I can\u2019t just force my will on them.</p><br/><p>So, that day ended with just a greeting.</p><br/><p>\u300cK-Ken-chan\u2026 are you okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStay away! That mask wearing instructor\u2026 what the hell was that!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey! Calm down, calm down, okay!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I could hear them making noise beyond the door, but I paid it no mind.</p><br/><p>I only allowed another member to introduce themselves. Ranga, I mean.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s probably observing the class instead of me. How pleasant.</p><br/><p>But the kids who clearly lack the will to solve the problems he handed out, seem keen on playing around.</p><br/><p>So the fact that today\u2019s lesson became Self-Study is something I could not have prevented.</p><br/><p>So, leaving the rest to Ranga, I decided to visit Yuuki.</p><br/><p>Inside the Freedom Association Chief\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Yuuki and I are holding a discussion while sitting on the sofa.</p><br/><p>A pleasant aroma drifts from cup of tea before us.</p><br/><p>I continue the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo\u2026. please tell me the kids\u2019 circumstances\u300d</p><br/><p>I get straight to the point.</p><br/><p>Yuuki looked me straight in the eye, and after thinking for a bit,</p><br/><p>\u300cRimuru-san, let me ask you a question\u2026</p><br/><p>How much do you know abut Sakaguchi Hinata?\u300d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that about? Did something happen between Hinata and the kids?</p><br/><p>\u300cNot much. She\u2019s a fellow Japanese.</p><br/><p>And that she remembers things quickly\u2013so Shizu-san said\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmph, he nodded in response,</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, how about the difference between \u201cSummoned\u201d and \u201cWorld Travelers\u201d?\u300d</p><br/><p>Now that he mentions it, I don\u2019t know much about them either.</p><br/><p>They are guaranteed to possess a unique skill. And, the summoning success rate is low.</p><br/><p>Also, they have a curse carved into their souls.</p><br/><p>I told him that much.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. That matches everything that we have learned about them. You know a lot, don\u2019t you\u2026</p><br/><p>Anyways.</p><br/><p>Summoning requires very definite circumstances to be prepared as to allow you to summon a person with powerful abilities.</p><br/><p>Someone whose will is especially strong.</p><br/><p>Now then, what about summoning conducted under incomplete conditions?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki\u2019s following explanation made me feel sick.</p><br/><p>The success rate with thirty magicians chanting summoning magic over the period of three days is a less than 0.03%.</p><br/><p>Moreover, a magician who has used summoning magic, cannot use it during a set interval.</p><br/><p>The rest period ranges from 33 to 88 years. Usually, the time is used to prepare the environment to better the chances of the summoning.</p><br/><p>Now, what would happen if you ignored these rules?</p><br/><p>If you do, there are less requirements to conduct the summoning and you can continuously summon.</p><br/><p>According to what Yuuki said, summoning conducted thus usually results in children being summoned.</p><br/><p>Children with strong souls or abundant magic are forced over here. Without being granted the ability befitting them\u2026</p><br/><p>Without a unique skill, the abundant magical energy causes their bodies to implode.</p><br/><p>They are fried alive by the powers they possess.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Wait a minute, then are those kids?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026. At the moment, the record is three years..</p><br/><p>That is the lifespan of those improperly summoned.</p><br/><p>And, those kids have been summoned like that\u2026</p><br/><p>Failing to become heroes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWha\u2026 Huh? Heroes? Why would\u2026</p><br/><p>Were they forced into this by Sakaguchi Hinata?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki does not answer.</p><br/><p>However, his silence only confirms my suspicions.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe church is seeking a new hope, a new power.</p><br/><p>The wish of all humans\u2013light. Humanity\u2019s messiah, the \u201cHero\u201d!</p><br/><p>I have secretly investigated many facilities and broke the children out\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2026 the hell\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI have not found a way to prevent their deaths.</p><br/><p>Children under the age of ten are no exception\u2013if they do not possess a unique skill, they will surely die\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAren\u2019t the summoners bothered by the loss? Aren\u2019t these \u201cfailures\u201d dissuading them or something?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey calmly summon more and more. Since they can just continue doing so, they don\u2019t care. That\u2019s probably what they are thinking\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you kidding me? Why have you allowed the church to continue existing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe church\u2026 the Western Saint\u2019s Church if influential.</p><br/><p>Surrounding the Jura Forest, other than the Heretic Country Sarion, every country is a devout follower of the church.</p><br/><p>Do you understand? That\u2019s not a power we can defeat even with the Government\u2019s support.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also believers among my associates.</p><br/><p>If we make the church our enemy, the Association would fight with itself!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki said, his expression pained and powerless.</p><br/><p>Nor could I add anything. To think that those lively kids will\u2026</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s why they met me with hostility and hatred.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey. Why did you have me meet the kids? Why did you tell me all this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Why, indeed? Maybe I wanted to see if you could come up with a way to save them.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have anyone in the world I could rely upon. I\u2019ve already lost Shizu-san.</p><br/><p>If you hadn\u2019t noticed, I wouldn\u2019t have told you anything.</p><br/><p>So why did you notice?\u300d</p><br/><p>Damn it.</p><br/><p>If I hadn\u2019t noticed, I could have sent them on their way merrily.</p><br/><p>Now that I have, how can I be merry? What a bad joke\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t it dangerous to have the school so close to a church?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu. On the contrary, it\u2019s the safest place. You\u2019ve heard the expression: it\u2019s darkest under the lamppost?</p><br/><p>So, what will you do? Will you quit?\u300d</p><br/><p>I looked Yuuki straight in the eye.</p><br/><p>And loudly declared,</p><br/><p>\u300cI will not quit, and will proceed as I wish from now on. Any complaints?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yuuki nodded.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cI leave them to you. If you can, please save those children\u2026!\u300d</p><br/><p>He said, lowering his head.</p><br/><p>No need to tell me.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s another task Shizu-san had left behind. I\u2019ll see it through.</p><br/><p>And, chances are, this whole conversation was planned by Shizu-san ahead of time.</p><br/><p>Just a stray thought.</p><br/><p>I leave the Freedom Association building and return to the classroom.</p><br/><p>Now, now. Can\u2019t greet them with a gloomy face.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll do what I can. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing thus far.</p><br/><p>Shizu-san depended on me, Yuuki asked this of me, all I can do is to answer their hopes.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>That was the worst day in history for the Beast Kingdom Yuurazia.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Karion nervously looked into the skies above.</p><br/><p>A huge lump of magical energy was rapidly approaching.</p><br/><p>Without even trying to hide her aura\u2013Demon Lord Milim.</p><br/><p>(Hey, hey, is this for real\u2026)</p><br/><p>She\u2019s clearly intent on fighting and aiming for this country.</p><br/><p>A fight with a serious Milim Nava. I guess this could also be called an opportunity.</p><br/><p>Karion did not believe himself to be superior; in fact, he though Milim to be stronger.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s more fun winning against a stronger opponent!)</p><br/><p>His blood boiled and his heart beat happily.</p><br/><p>The strongest, Demon Lord Milim. A senior Demon Lord, unlike her appearance, she deserves the awe.</p><br/><p>He could face that Demon Lord. To say he was excited would be an understatement.</p><br/><p>He had once asked his parents when he was but a child.</p><br/><p>About the tyranny of the Dragon Princess.</p><br/><p>Was that fairy tale based on Milim or some other model? This is what his parents said.</p><br/><p>A dragon princess\u2019s anger can erase a country!</p><br/><p>Never fight against a dragon princess!</p><br/><p>What rubbish.</p><br/><p>Though the military of the Beast Kingdom Yuuzaria is not particularly large, half of its population belong to a warrior race.</p><br/><p>By no means inferior to any other country.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he himself had evolved into a Demon Lord. There was no one he had to fear!</p><br/><p>He headed to the sacred mountain behind the castle; and, while preparing himself, he planned to ambush Milim there.</p><br/><p>His followers\u2013devils and retainers, knelt before him, waiting for instructions.</p><br/><p>\u300cListen! We only have one foe. Demon Lord Milim Nava!</p><br/><p>Against a demon lord, if you devils fight together, you can put up a proper fight. But I will go myself!</p><br/><p>As for you, erect a barrier and protect the people! Believe me, I shall win!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cAy!!!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing their battle cry, he could feel their excitement.</p><br/><p>Today, he had the chance to prove himself the strongest!</p><br/><p>(I didn\u2019t hate her personality. We could have become good friends\u2026 what a shame!)</p><br/><p>At this point, her reasons did not matter.</p><br/><p>For him, only the fight mattered. Not that his prudence would have changed the outcome in the slightest\u2026</p><br/><p>Slowly, he rose to the skies using\u3008Flight Magic\u3009.</p><br/><p>Reaching Milim, he began the fight without a word.</p><br/><p>First, a quick test.</p><br/><p>Punch her with all his power. However, her body covered in many defensive barriers, the attack did not reach her.</p><br/><p>He summoned the Hyakko-seiryuu lance, and felt his strength grow exponentially.</p><br/><p>Letting out a small breath, he combined his fighting spirit with his aura.</p><br/><p>And released an onslaught of slashes at Milim. Each slash was followed by an air bullet which violently assaulted Milim.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Though the bullets have broken through a number of barriers, they were unable to hurt her body.</p><br/><p>Moreover, each of the slashes was caught by her demon sword \u201cEvil God\u201d.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t suit her at all, that long, curved, single-edged blade.</p><br/><p>The sword was dyed in a pale blue light.</p><br/><p>How many demon lords has this famous sword slain?</p><br/><p>Tch! Karion distanced himself from Milim and regained his posture.</p><br/><p>He had not looked down on her at all, but she far surpassed his expectations.</p><br/><p>He had not used every ounce of his power, but Milim also seemed bottomless.</p><br/><p>Nor was she an opponent he could fight conflicted.</p><br/><p>He decided to go all out. Unfortunately, she seemed barely unconscious, as if she was being controlled by someone.</p><br/><p>That, however, didn\u2019t matter to Karion.</p><br/><p>(I had wanted to fight the real you, not some puppet! But, even so, I will not lose!)</p><br/><p>He unleashed his abilities.</p><br/><p>Began assuming first his devil, then his demon lord form.</p><br/><p>He is, after all, known as the Beast King, a lion lycanthrope.</p><br/><p>Thus, he began transforming. Into a beast devil.</p><br/><p>And thus his true form, Demon Lord \u201cLion King\u201d Karion, had appeared.</p><br/><p>Covered in a silver fur, his muscles bulged.</p><br/><p>On his lion head a Vermillion Bird crown shone bright. And that body was clad in Black Tortoise armor.</p><br/><p>The neighboring countries all specialized in warfare. So, for the sake of fighting for the dominance of the skies, large eagle-like wings were attached to his back.</p><br/><p>Seeing that appearance a small light briefly flashed in Milim\u2019s eyes, and Karion had not missed it.</p><br/><p>Or maybe he had only imagined it.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, then, Milim. It\u2019s a shame, but now that you have seen this appearance, I\u2019ll have you permanently disappear, okay?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a shame, but goodbye!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>He screamed, and concentrated all his fighting spirit into the Hyakko-seiryuu lance.</p><br/><p>If they had been on the ground, the earth would split from the force of his power and his surroundings would grind into dust.</p><br/><p>Not that the air remained unaffected. The energy he had emitted set the air itself on fire.</p><br/><p>Beast roar!!!</p><br/><p>This roar releases one\u2019s magical energy at the opponent.</p><br/><p>All his energy was focused on the tip of the lance, yet it remained undamaged.</p><br/><p>Had he fired it on the ground, everything in the direction of the attack would be inadvertently erased; it is \u201cBeast King\u201d Karion\u2019s sure-kill technique.</p><br/><p>Normally, its power would not wane in the slightest for the first 100 meters. And, the actual range of the attack could go well past 2 kilometers.</p><br/><p>Thus, the long range makes this a skill that is best used against multiple opponents, but it can be regulated to be concentrated on a single one.</p><br/><p>This would be the first time he will use Beast Roar against a single opponent, but he could hardly imagine anyone being able to withstand it.</p><br/><p>He will go all out.</p><br/><p>Magical energy rapidly escaped his body. He could hardly sustain the flight magic.</p><br/><p>However, that was a small price to pay for this attack.</p><br/><p>Normally, he\u2019d have to use it two or three times to become this tired; but, today he couldn\u2019t be so reserved.</p><br/><p>His opponent was covered in many high level barriers.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep, and while falling towards the ground,</p><br/><p>*Zuzzzza!!!*</p><br/><p>He dodged the return fire.</p><br/><p>Blood trickled down from his back, but he closed the wound with spirit alone.</p><br/><p>He looked up at her.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to see her, nor believe that such a thing could be possible.</p><br/><p>A being who has so far exceeded his expectations.</p><br/><p>Dragon wings spread wide, her blond hair fluttered in the wind.</p><br/><p>And, though it was not there before, a beautiful crimson horn now adorned her forehead.</p><br/><p>Her light Gothic dress has changed into jet black armor</p><br/><p>(Ah\u2026 so this would be her real battle attire, huh\u2026)</p><br/><p>Though Karion was now exhausted, his opponent was unhurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke. Cut me some slack.\u201d He was now experiencing a bizarre feeling\u2013wanting to cry and laugh at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell done! That was fun!</p><br/><p>As thanks, I\u2019ll show you this!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim spoke for the first time.</p><br/><p>However, it was a monotone voice devoid of her personality.</p><br/><p>Karion nonetheless felt impending doom from her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to show me anything!\u201d He screamed in his heart.</p><br/><p>Using thought transmission he conveyed an order to his subordinates.</p><br/><p>One word: run!!!</p><br/><p>And, with the remained of his strength, he ran as fast as he could.</p><br/><p>He felt it deep in his bones: if he stayed, he would die.</p><br/><p>The dragon\u2019s pupils dilated, and she stretched her wings.</p><br/><p>Milim roared!</p><br/><p>Dragon Nova!!!</p><br/><p>Its brightness easily surpassed that of the stars.</p><br/><p>The bright pellets that rained upon the earth erased not just the castle, but the mountain behind it.</p><br/><p>The sound of destruction far surpassed the audible range of one\u2019s ears, so the shockwave heralded it instead.</p><br/><p>Those touched by the light disappeared without being able to offer any resistance.</p><br/><p>The strongest magic.</p><br/><p>And one of the reasons that Milim has for so long reigned supreme.</p><br/><p>Impossible\u2026</p><br/><p>Luckily, Karion was able to escape receiving a direct hit, so he survived.</p><br/><p>But that is Milim.</p><br/><p>A demon lord you should never fight against. Nicknamed \u201cDestruction\u201d itself.</p><br/><p>Now, Karion agreed with his parents\u2019 words.</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t fight against that. It\u2019s dimension different from everyone else.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, she\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShe..? Ara? What could possibly be wrong? Would you enlighten me?\u300d</p><br/><p>He felt a blade press against his neck.</p><br/><p>And the presence of a single woman.</p><br/><p>The supreme ruler of the skies\u2013Sky Queen Frey.</p><br/><p>\u300cTch. Frey, you too?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAra? What about me? You\u2019ll have lots of time to tell me\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>And so, Karion consciousness faded into darkness\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

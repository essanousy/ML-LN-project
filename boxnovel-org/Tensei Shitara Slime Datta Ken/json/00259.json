Actually, I haven\u2019t got around to thinking about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>While still using his weird expression, Laplace glanced at me for help.</p><br/><p>You idiot! You didn\u2019t think about it?!</p><br/><p>Or rather, it\u2019s troublesome if you come asking me for help in this situation\u2026 I guess I have no choice.</p><div></div><br/><p>If I use too much of my abilities, they will find out. And stopping the time is out of the question as Laplace can\u2019t move in the suspended world.</p><br/><p>However, at this distance, it is possible to use \u2018thought transmission\u2019 for ultrfast thought conversation.</p><br/><p>If the processing speed is accelerated by 10,000 times, 1 second would be equal to 166 minutes.</p><br/><p>While thinking of it as a bother, I used \u2018thought acceleration\u2019 on Laplace and his crew.</p><br/><p>The moment I used the skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood day, Rimuru-sama! How did you like my acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been a while, Rimuru-sama! Is it okay to leave the rest of this to us as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>They greeted me, as if they were waiting for it.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s also fine to leave it to them but I do have the time so I decided to listen to their plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Laplace. You didn\u2019t think any further than this, have you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I did think a bit, for what it matters, you know? But it\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t thought of what punishment to give if they score below a certain point or even what point that would be since I don\u2019t know the students. To think that red-hair would come specifically asking for the minimum number\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems like Laplace was planning to act after seeing the results.</p><br/><p>It is true that he can\u2019t carelessly give them a number since he doesn\u2019t know how much the students might be able score but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAt times like that, it\u2019s fine if you just go \u2018that~is~a~s-e-c-r-e-t~!\u2019, you idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh! There was that move.\u201d</p><br/><p>With an \u2018oops\u2019 expression on his face, Laplace scratched his head.</p><br/><p>He looks like he\u2019s really aware and shrewd and what not but there are times like these where he\u2019s just stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no point in saying that this late so let\u2019s decide on the number.\u201d</p><br/><p>I brought back the topic from derailment.</p><br/><p>To review, let\u2019s first confirm how this bracelet\u2019s scoring method works.</p><br/><p>Alert movement: 1-10 points</p><br/><p>Negotiation actions: 1-10 points</p><br/><p>Monster subjugation: Below E \u2013 1 point</p><br/><p>D \u2013 2 to 5 points</p><br/><p>C \u2013 6 to 30 points</p><br/><p>B \u2013 31 to 100 points</p><br/><p>A \u2013 500 points</p><br/><p>Above A \u2013 10,000 points~</p><br/><p>Rescue movement: 1-30 points</p><br/><p>Obstruction movement: -1 to -100 points *Does not go below 0</p><br/><p>Dangerous action: Points reset</p><br/><p>Murder: Points fixed to zero</p><br/><p>I think that\u2019s about how it was set up more or less.</p><br/><p>The \u2018actions\u2019 and \u2018movement\u2019 are areas where the individual is awarded points but in \u2018subjugation\u2019, the whole party shares the points.</p><br/><p>However, I will make it so that they all have at least 1 point</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a safety measure \u2019cause otherwise it would be too severe.</p><br/><p>Of course, I wouldn\u2019t be giving them a point even if they form a party and defeat a monster below E rank.</p><br/><p>It goes without saying but if one subjugates a monster by themselves, they will get all the points.</p><br/><p>However, there\u2019s danger in going down that road.</p><br/><p>For example, although there are monsters above A rank in this monster, it would be impossible for them to hunt those down.</p><br/><p>Against one A rank monster, there needs to be 5 B+ ranked adventurers for it to be equal.</p><br/><p>This is the current lowest rank of a floor boss in the labyrinth but even top parties with 6 adventurers have a hard time dealing with it.</p><br/><p>To defeat these monsters safely, at least double the amount of members is needed.</p><br/><p>It would be great if the students who aren\u2019t even B rank yet can hunt a C rank monster in a group.</p><br/><p>If I were to be realistic, it would be hard for these students to even get a 100 points in a week\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so they would only go upto a 100 points even if they try really hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laplace said with a thoughtful expression after listening to my explanation.</p><br/><p>For the students, even if they hunted a D rank goblin, they would only get 1 point each. They won\u2019t reach a 100 points even if they beat 14 goblins a day.</p><br/><p>To begin with, this isn\u2019t a monster land or anything so monsters won\u2019t be coming out one after another like in the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>With the Calamity type monster on the top, a pyramid shape was taking form.</p><br/><p>We have already confirmed one \u2018hazard monster\u2019 in each 4 sides of the island.</p><br/><p>Only these 5 are over rank A.</p><br/><p>Besides that, it seems like there are a few several other unique monsters of A rank.</p><br/><p>With these monsters in the lead, they were increasing their numbers and races.</p><br/><p>But even then, there are like a few dozen B rank monsters and a few hundred C rank monsters.</p><br/><p>And there are barely a few thousand D rank monsters.</p><br/><p>If 100 students were to hunt 100 D rank monsters each, they would need 10,000 D rank monsters.</p><br/><p>But such numbers of monsters do not exist in this island and so they have no choice but to go for dangerous C rank monsters.</p><br/><p>Or rather, if they went to do that seriously then it would disrupt the ecosystem of the island and I doubt the king of this island would permit it.</p><br/><p>So logically, that\u2019s a no-go.</p><br/><p>The fact that the number of monsters is less means that the danger is also less.</p><br/><p>And that is why we chose this island-because we can confirm their safety. It would not be dangerous unless they challenged the semi-demon-lord by themselves.</p><br/><p>As for me, I want them to learn how to cooperate with others here.</p><br/><p>The ones who are arrogant, the ones who are insensitive and even the ones who don\u2019t believe in themselves.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Will you really not join us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Irina! You are wrong. Trampling over the opinions of others and forcing your will onto them, is that not oppression! Isn\u2019t that the method that you hated the most!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Marsha answered Irina\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>They were words of persuasion that were both a rejection and a plea.</p><br/><p>Irina\u2019s expression was full of pain for an instant\u2013</p><br/><p>But she quickly regained her calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 I am a failure as both teacher and researcher. I have a tendency of prioritizing my own emotions instead of what is right. I never had the right to teach you in the first place. But still\u2026 I cannot bring myself to forgive Great Demon Lord Rimuru! I know we could never beat him in an honest fight, but still, I want to hit him just once. We cannot allow our plan to leak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Irina seemed to have some deep hatred for me.</p><br/><p>We weren\u2019t acquaintances, so where did it come from\u2026</p><br/><p>It was difficult.She might have tried to address her grievances to me directly, but it would not have seemed very realistic at all.</p><br/><p>She must have decided that there was no choice but to quietly make preparations and take control over the world from the shadows.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t win in an honest fight, so they had to move from the back.</p><br/><p>I would have done the same, and it seemed like the right decision\u2013that is, had it not involved the school.</p><br/><p>There were things in this world that you just could not do.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you at least promised you wouldn\u2019t interfere\u2014no, no attachments. I must be resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then with perfectly clear eyes directed at the students, she administered to herself the thing she was holding.</p><br/><p>It was a syringe filled with liquid.</p><br/><p>Irina, who was well versed in herbs, had formulated it herself. It seemed to be some kind of strengthening agent made of various concentrated medicines.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf magic doesn\u2019t work, then I will just use this body to cut my way through. Now, those of you who are ready, let us fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no hesitation in those eyes now.</p><br/><p>It was not the face of a teacher, it was the face of a warrior.</p><br/><p>And Rozari\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMagnus, I will be of use to you as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>So saying, she injected herself with the medicine, just as Irina had.</p><br/><p>Irina and Rozari\u2019s muscles expanded as a strength that exceeded human limits entered them.</p><br/><p>According to \u2018Appraisal,\u2019 there power was just as strong as Berna and Clad, who had Greater Demons inside of them.</p><br/><p>It was an insane increase in power.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, I also just noticed that Magnus had not called a demon at all.</p><br/><p>He was fighting the three defenders with his own ability.</p><br/><p>Julius and the others had planned to bear all of the attacks without concern towards anything else, until the poison tiger had taken out at least one knight.</p><br/><p>And so it was lucky for them that Magnus had not been going all out\u2026</p><br/><p>But now that Irina and Rozari had joined, the sense of balance in the fight had crumbled.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Miss Irina joins, we will fight her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Brown and two other combat teachers shouted as they joined the fight.</p><br/><p>I would have liked it if the students handled everything, but I guess it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>If you compared Irina and Rozari, you would see that Irina was overwhelmingly stronger.</p><br/><p>So even with four A-rank teachers against her, Irina was managing them quite well.</p><br/><p>Irina\u2019s fighting style was magic fighter.</p><br/><p>You directly converted magic energy into attack power and attacked with it.</p><br/><p>It was why she was able to fight weapon-wielding teachers with her fists.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website.

If you wish to protect the students, come and stop me!\u201d</p><br/><p>And that was how the battle between Brown\u2019s team and Irina began.</p><br/><p>While Irina was being attacked by the four teachers, Rozari was still free.</p><br/><p>The remaining students were no match for her now, and the situation immediately became dangerous.</p><br/><p>It was Mondo who acted first.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoahhh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a shout, Mondo rammed into Rozari, just as she was about to disarm the magic team.</p><br/><p>This meant that Julius and Karma would have to deal with Magnus without him, but it was a good decision.</p><br/><p>Mondo could not defeat Rozari.</p><br/><p>However, he could buy them some time.</p><br/><p>I was looking forward to seeing what he would do in the rest of the fight.</p><br/><p>As for the fight between the poison tiger and Berna and Clad, it was at a stale-mate</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. Blasted beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get so worked up, Berna. We will only be defeated it you do not keep your calm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that!\u201d</p><br/><p>A stale-mate here meant that the students were doing very well.</p><br/><p>There was support from the magic team and directions from the beast people.</p><br/><p>They were functioning well as a group.</p><br/><p>The outcome of this battle would depend on the tide.</p><br/><p>If just one of the main fighters on the enemy side fell, then we would gain a huge advantage.</p><br/><p>But if the poison tiger was defeated, the students would lose for sure.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.It all depended on making the right decisions and the healing of the magic team.</p><br/><p>It was a heavy role for these students with little experience, but I could only pray that they would do their best until the end.</p><br/><p>And the last group.</p><br/><p>Julius and Karma vs Magnus\u2026</p><br/><p>Magnus must be struggling with something still, because his sword seemed slower when it came to a direct fight.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Magnus did not wish to hurt his friends.</p><br/><p>He had looked pained when Julius and Karma had tried to persuade him.</p><br/><p>Regardless of his true feelings, it was nearly time for the fight to end.</p><br/><p>The heart was a complicated thing, and it was difficult for people to truly understand each other.</p><br/><p>But if you still wish to do so, then there is no other way then to clash with your real feelings.</p><br/><p>It might cause you to break apart, but that cannot be helped.</p><br/><p>I thought such things as I continued to watch the fight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

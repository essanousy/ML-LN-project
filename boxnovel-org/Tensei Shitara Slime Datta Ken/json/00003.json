If you talk like that, you will lose customers!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: Then what do I do?</p><br/><p>Clown: Tell them a stupid joke.

At any rate, I don\u2019t got ears to hear.</p><br/><p>(Oi! You can hear me, can\u2019t you? Responding would be good!)</p><br/><p>I can hear you!</p><br/><p>But, however! Since I lack a voice, I cannot respond.</p><br/><p>As a test,</p><br/><p>(Too loud, baldie!)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the answer I tried to project in my head.</p><br/><p>Well, not like you hear it anyways, so you should be fine. But, how did I respond\u2026</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Ho, Hoho! To deign us a baldy, aren\u2019t You a brave one!!! It has been long since I have last had company so I may have started poorly, but this one seems to be searching for death!)</p><br/><p>This is bad. He heard that one.</p><br/><p>But hey, when I think words in my head, I can respond! Had I been taught that earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have to anger my partner.</p><br/><p>And besides, I don\u2019t even know what my partner is like at all.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s that. Time to throw in the towel.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s properly apologize here.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t know how to respond, so I decided to try whatever seemed appropriate. I sincerely apologize!</p><br/><p>And on that note, I must note that I have no eyes to see with, so I cannot behold your visage.)</p><br/><p>Did that reach?</p><br/><p>Well, although I can\u2019t see him, who would expect him to actually be bald? Though if that\u2019s the case, then any amount of rage can only be expected.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s also refrain from thoughtless statements (?).</p><br/><p>(Fufufu. Fuhaha. Fuahahahahaha!)</p><br/><p>And suddenly, laughter.</p><br/><p>A perfect, three step laughter. Simply breathtaking.</p><br/><p>Has the anger passed?</p><br/><p>(Interesting. Truly, stated without beholding my appearance as I suspected, but for you to lack eyes. Slime species are typically thoughtless creatures that only [Absorb], [Dissolve], and [Regenerate]. I have yet to behold one leaving their territory.)</p><br/><p>Somehow, he started telling a tale?</p><br/><p>Rather than abating his anger, did I win his interest\u2026?</p><br/><p>At any rate, this is first contact. This is the first chapter in my life\u2019s (slime) story.</p><br/><p>I want to proceed on favorable terms.</p><br/><p>And learn a lot from him.</p><br/><p>(When a slime suddenly rammed my body, I naturally found it rather bizarre. At an exceptionally high speed, at that. What are You? A named monster? A unique monster?</p><br/><p>Named? Unique? I don\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>(I apologize, but I don\u2019t really understand the meaning of what you said. Truth be told, since I have been born only 90 days have\u2026)</p><br/><p>(Ay. Self-awareness is something impossible for a slime. Named monsters are those that have received a name, but to have had only 90 days pass since birth\u2026 in that case, unique?)</p><br/><p>(What would you mean by \u201cunique\u201d?)</p><br/><p>(Unique monsters are those who have undergone some mutation and possess unusual powers. Rarely, such are born in areas with high magical energy density\u2026 I see, your birth was founded on magical energy drawn from myself!)</p><br/><p>Mumu? And what would that mean?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see if past world\u2019s knowledge can be used figure this one out.</p><br/><p>In other words, from this old man (assumption) magical energy flows, and thus it has become abundant in around here.</p><br/><p>And when that energy gathered, the monster that was born from it\u2013the slime = myself? Is that it?</p><br/><p>(Ay. In these 300 years, a monster who could approach myself had not existed. Being born from my power, perhaps You could even lay your hands upon myself!)</p><br/><p>(Hoho\u2026 in that case, you would be something akin to my parent?)</p><br/><p>(A parent would be the wrong way to call it. After all, I do not possess reproductive capabilities. Some monsters can reproduce, and some cannot.)</p><br/><p>(Normally, lacking such capabilities would be normal, no? If monsters born from condensed magical energy, wouldn\u2019t reproduction be unnecessary?)</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Little one, you are surprisingly intelligent. Normally, the monsters who think are few in number, but those that possess true intelligence would be only the Majin\u2026</p><br/><p>But that is fine, I will respond to your question.</p><br/><p>There are inferior tribes which reproduce. Goblins and orcs, along with lizardmen\u2013to name a few. These are special among the monsters, and are commonly referred to as demi-humans.</p><br/><p>Among demi-humans, there also those who have befriended humanity. Elves, hobbits, and dwarfs\u2013those belonging to the fair magical races.</p><br/><p>Well, in a few words, those the support the Majin are called monsters, and those that support humans are recognized as a part of their species.</p><br/><p>These demi-humans would be the representatives of the reproducing monsters. Though to me they are no more than trash!</p><br/><p>Next, about the Majin.</p><br/><p>Although these have been born from magical energy, they are generally beasts and magical beasts who have evolved beyond themselves.</p><br/><p>Reproductive capabilities and true intelligence are considered their special features. Most of all, these tend to vary as individuals.</p><br/><p>Among these, there also the high class majin. They are the most disorganize and diverse bunch.</p><br/><p>The conclude, the giants, the vampires, and the devils are the high class majin with the longest life span.</p><br/><p>Although these too can reproduce, they normally abstain. Hosting overwhelming magical energy, their flesh never decays.</p><br/><p>And so, there is no need to leave offspring. Though perhaps if their numbers were to decrease due to a war or some great calamity, that may change.</p><br/><p>As one would expect, they are strong. I myself have fought with them many times, yet they are not an opponent you can face many at a time.</p><br/><p>A perfect brawling partner!</p><br/><p>All together, these are referred to as the demonic races.</p><br/><p>Of high intelligence, capable of reproduction, and laying waste to humanity\u2013these are deigned as demons by them.</p><br/><p>As for why I cannot reproduce\u2026 there is simply no need.</p><br/><p>I art a \u201cA being perfect as one, one of the four existing dragons.</p><br/><p>The Storm Dragon Veldora!\u201d Such is I!</p><br/><p>I am bound by neither time nor flesh! A mass of pure magical energy, and thus I art endless!!!</p><br/><p>Fu\u2026. hahahahahahaha!!!)</p><br/><p>And there he goes with his high pitched laughter\u2026</p><br/><p>So basically, since he has no lifespan, he needs no children! That kind of thing?</p><br/><p>His explanation dragged on, but it was pretty useful.</p><br/><p>Storm Dragon Veldora\u2026 a dragon, huh?</p><br/><p>Fighting high class majin for fun, ain\u2019t he a dangerous fellow?</p><br/><p>This would fit the taste of most people engrossed in manga, anime, and light novels.</p><br/><p>With all that I know, there is no question that the Storm Dragon Veldora is dangerous.</p><br/><p>And the fact that he explained everything so politely just makes this feel more ominous.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 what to do next\u2026</p><br/><p>(Is\u2026 is that so! What an easy to understand explanation, thank you very much! Well then, I\u2019ll excuse myself!)</p><br/><p>With those words, I tried to take my leave.</p><br/><p>(Wait. I have explained myself. Is it not your turn? Hmm?)</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t seem like a situation where I need to quickly run away.</p><br/><p>Yeah~. Let\u2019s talk about myself\u2026 but wait. I reincarnated into a different world! If I said that, would he even believe it?</p><br/><p>As a slime possessing high intelligence, deceiving him would be unthinkable.</p><br/><p>If anything, if he will figure out that I am trying to deceive him\u2026 that would raise a death flag, wouldn\u2019t i?</p><br/><p>Oh, well.</p><br/><p>Whether he believes me or not, is not for me to decide.</p><br/><p>Having come to a decision, I discussed everything that happened until now.</p><br/><p>\u30fb</p><br/><p>\u30fb</p><br/><p>\u30fb</p><br/><p>\u30fb</p><br/><p>\u30fb</p><br/><p>(And well, that\u2019s the thing! Ain\u2019t it strange!)</p><br/><p>Without mentioning anything about my skills, I discussed everything from when I got stabbed, to waking up as a slime, and situations I\u2019ve lived through.</p><br/><p>As I was saying this, it strangely did not seem a troubling situation at all, but, well, it was pretty bad.</p><br/><p>The fact that I can\u2019t see being the worst part of it all.</p><br/><p>If this goes on, won\u2019t I pass on every cute girls and beautiful women around?</p><br/><p>That makes me said\u2026</p><br/><p>(I see. You had reincarnated as I thought. What a truly rare method you used.)</p><br/><p>(Eh? Method? And hey, aren\u2019t you supposed to be doubtful or surprised?)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that response. Isn\u2019t reincarnation supposed to be something really rare? From the way he says it, normal birth is beginning to seem more unusual!</p><br/><p>(Ay. Reincarnated tend to appear once in a while. Souls with strong intentions engraved in them.</p><br/><p>Those among them who remember their past life are not all that unusual</p><br/><p>But to have reincarnated from a different world\u2026 that is rare.</p><br/><p>Moreover, you\u2019d normally be born from a human. But to be born as a monster, and from magical energy to say the least\u2026 that I have never heard of.</p><br/><p>To have crossed the boundaries of the worlds, just having a strong soul is not enough. Had you not stabilized your soul in this demonic body, your soul would have vanished.</p><br/><p>You are special.)</p><br/><p>(Is that so? I wasn\u2019t self aware, though\u2026 So there are those who have reincarnated from a different world, huh?)</p><br/><p>(Ay. Although there haven\u2019t been successful cases of world travel, some have wandered from there to this side.</p><br/><p>A \u201cForeigner\u201d and a \u201cWorld Traveler\u201d\u2013so they are called, and they possess special intellect. Also, they tend to have acquired some special skills.</p><br/><p>Records of reincarnated being renowned for their wisdom do remain. Though there are most likely those that were never recognized.)</p><br/><p>I see. Other worlds.. I do not know whether they are from my Earth or not, but meeting them would not be a bad idea.</p><br/><p>Maybe, there are a few Japanese around.</p><br/><p>Might as well make meeting one my goal.</p><br/><p>(I see! In that case, I\u2019ll go see if I can meet any \u201cWorld Traveler\u201d. Maybe, I\u2019ll find a compatriot among them.)</p><br/><p>(Still, little one. You can\u2019t even see.)</p><br/><p>(Ah\u2026 right.)</p><br/><p>If I can\u2019t see, then what?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s inconvenient, but if I carefully hop around, I\u2019m certain to meet them someday. Probably.</p><br/><p>(I shall restore your sight.)</p><br/><p>Huh? What?</p><br/><p>Oi oi, this old man, no, this Storm Dragon Veldora\u2026 ain\u2019t he a good man (dragon)?</p><br/><p>Can I really expect this miracle?</p><br/><p>(Eh? Will you really?)</p><br/><p>(Ay. But, there is a condition. How about it?)</p><br/><p>A condition\u2026 huh. Ominous, but\u2026</p><br/><p>(What sort of condition?)</p><br/><p>(A simple one. When you regain your sight, do not fear me. And, please come talk to me again. How about it?)</p><br/><p>Is just that fine?</p><br/><p>And could it be\u2026 was this dragon just lonely? Solitude borne of strength?</p><br/><p>And just as I thought the conversation went on for a while. He must not have had anyone to talk to in a while.</p><br/><p>Maybe he\u2019s just a big softy.</p><br/><p>But, maybe he\u2019s not even a real dragon. Or maybe the dragons of this world aren\u2019t all that impressive.</p><br/><p>Yup. This is certainly a good deal.</p><br/><p>(Is just that much enough?)</p><br/><p>(Ay. Truth be told, I had been sealed away for three hundred years. And so, I have been so plagued by boredom. How about it?)</p><br/><p>(If you are alright with it, then I will happily accept!)</p><br/><p>(Ay. Then it\u2019s a promise. Keep it!)</p><br/><p>(I will! As they say, I am a dependable slime!)</p><br/><p>Of course, only I think so.</p><br/><p>(Very well. There exists a [Magic Perception] skill. Can you use it?)</p><br/><p>(No, I cannot. What type of skill is it?)</p><br/><p>(You perceive the surrounding magical energy. It\u2019s not a major skill, and acquiring the skill is rather simple.)</p><br/><p>(Ho ho. Simple you say!))</p><br/><p>\u203bTruly, it is actually not simple at all.</p><br/><p>(Ay. For those like I, it is as simple as breathing\u2013you don\u2019t even know you are doing it.)</p><br/><p>(I see! If I were to acquire it, would I be able to see?)</p><br/><p>(That is the idea. The world is covered in magical energy. There is a difference in concentration. And, light and dark possess a wave like property, did you know?)</p><br/><p>(Yeah, light wave and dark waves, right?)</p><br/><p>(You know well, is that knowledge from the other world? Well, it is so.</p><br/><p>But observing these fluctuations, you can calculate the appearance of the surrounding. Simply, right?)</p><br/><p>Haa? What the hell?</p><br/><p>This guy\u2026 how is that simply?!</p><br/><p>(Iya~, sounds a little difficult\u2026)</p><br/><p>(What? With this, even if your eyes and ears are crushed, you can continue combat. Ambushes become impossible. It\u2019s an indispensable skill!)</p><br/><p>(Iyaiyaiyaiya! Let\u2019s leave the matter of combat aside from now, I just want to be able to see!)</p><br/><p>(Muu~, if you say so. I\u2019ll help with acquisition! And by the way, I don\u2019t know another way!)</p><br/><p>(Wha\u2026 can you even do it?! Aren\u2019t you a beginner at this yourself?)</p><br/><p>(Don\u2019t worry. You are among the lucky few who possesses past world memories. Thus, you know what light and darkness looks like.</p><br/><p>If you had not known, making you see would have been impossible even for me. You are indeed blessed!)</p><br/><p>I see, explaining light and darkness would be difficult for those who have never seen them</p><br/><p>I know I couldn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>It took Hellen Keller 2 years to learn the meaning of words.</p><br/><p>In other words, due to other world\u2019s knowledge, I can obtain pseudo-sight and hearing through the [Magic Perception] skill\u2026</p><br/><p>Not like I can refuse to try anyways.</p><br/><p>Being unable to see is far too inconvenient.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I\u2019ve forgotten about it, but I also have the [Great Sage] skill.</p><br/><p>Surely something will come from this!</p><br/><p>(Please teach me!)</p><br/><p>(Nay, fret not; it is truly simple. First, try to move the magical energy inside your body.)</p><br/><p>This, I somehow understand. I think I can use the same principle as moving through the water.</p><br/><p>(Like this?)</p><br/><p>While enclosing it in my body, I verify movement of magical energy.</p><br/><p>(Ay. Though you said otherwise, you seem quiet apt at this. In this case, the energy that moves within you and that which is beside you\u2013do you feel the difference?)</p><br/><p>This is actually pretty simple.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a good thing I spent all that time feeling magical energy\u2013I mean, I live by absorbing it after all! Feeling it is a must!</p><br/><p>(That much I understand! Since I eat it, you know?)</p><br/><p>(Kukuku. Since you understand that much, the rest is simple. Feel the movement of magical energy outside of yourself.)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand, though.</p><br/><p>Anyways, as instructed, I tried to feel it.</p><br/><p>I do feel it swaying. Back and forth, back and forth\u2026</p><br/><p>Right! Let\u2019s active [Great Sage]!</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cVerified. Extra skill [Magic Perception]\u2026 has been succesfully acquired\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cWill you use extra skill [Magic Perception]? [YES]/[NO]\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>Did I really just acquire it that easily?</p><br/><p>Well yeah, of course, [YES].</p><br/><p>As expected, [Great Sage] is reliable as always!</p><br/><p>The moment I had activate the extra skill [Magic Perception], my mind was filled with information.</p><br/><p>Never, even as a human, had I processed that much information at once.</p><br/><p>Little by little, magical energy moving along\u2013waves of light and darkness.</p><br/><p>Having grasped all of the incoming information, I convert it into one I can understand.</p><br/><p>And so, I can now see 360 degrees around me, without a single blindspot.</p><br/><p>A boulder\u2019s shadow, the scenery 100 meters away: if I direct my consciousness there, I can see it.</p><br/><p>If a human\u2019s mind was filled with that much information\u2026 it just might fry.</p><br/><p>But, I am a slime. Every one of my cells is a muscle and a brain cell!</p><br/><p>I can definitely manage this much.</p><br/><p>And so\u2026</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cLinking extra skill [Magical Perception] and unique skill [Great Sage]\u2026 complete\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>My field of vision cleared up.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I was not attacked by a burning pain in my brain.</p><br/><p>That I wasn\u2019t able to do this until now is strange in itself, this is an obvious form of \u201cvision\u201d.</p><br/><p>[Great Sage] just might be a cheat.</p><br/><p>That certainly is not an overstatement.</p><br/><p>If others held it, I would certainly be crying foul. But the one possessing it, is me.</p><br/><p>So there\u2019s no problem.</p><br/><p>(Well\u2026 I somehow seem to have managed it. Thank you very much!)</p><br/><p>When I said that, I finally beheld \u201cthat.\u201d</p><br/><p>What do you know\u2026 a real dragon.</p><br/><p>Gleaming like black steel, flexible and durable, like the scales of a fish\u2026.</p><br/><p>The visage of an evil dragon\u2026</p><br/><p>(Geh!

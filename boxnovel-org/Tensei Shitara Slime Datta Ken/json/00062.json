My grandfather was a respected civil servant, Yoshida Yasutoshi!</p><br/><p>Pierrot: What?</p><br/><p>Clown: What, what?</p><br/><p>Pierrot: What about your grandmother? Wasn\u2019t she the bearded lady?</p><br/><p>Clown: You are being so mean today.

A Spirit is\u2026</p><br/><p>After vaporizing the golem I flashed an evil smile.</p><br/><p>Ku ku ku.</p><br/><p>Now we can continue the conversation on our terms.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, if you don\u2019t want to be scorched to death, how about you come on out?</p><br/><p>I know exactly where you are all hiding, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>I know the general direction but not the exact location.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d much rather they come out of their own volition.</p><br/><p>In response to my words, in great panic,</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! Yes, yes, yes!!!</p><br/><p>As You have commanded, though greatly embarrassed, we appear before you!!! \u300d</p><br/><p>And, with dragonfly wings growing from their backs, tiny and cute girls (?) came flying out.</p><br/><p>They were no longer than 30 cm in height. Not midgets, but the kind of fairy you\u2019d hear about in a fairy tale.</p><br/><p>At the front of the group lined up girls dressed in dazzling dresses with many frills; behind them, another group was dressed in rather plain dress.</p><br/><p>Overall, they dressed in darker colors.</p><br/><p>\u300cTa-daa! I am one of the ten gweat~\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She bit her tongue.</p><br/><p>Should I make fun of her? It seems that she\u2019s gotten so used to telepathy that she forgot how to talk.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026.. are you okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>She held up her hand in response,</p><br/><p>\u300cI am one of the ten great demon lords! Ramiris of the Labyrinth!!!</p><br/><p>Cease thou haughty actions! Show humility!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>She happily said,</p><br/><p>While proudly showing off her none-existent chest. Why do I feel so pissed off\u2026</p><br/><p>First, let\u2019s chop her.</p><br/><p>\u300cUhyou!!! Wha-what was that for! You\u2019ll give me a heart attack!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>She complained after dodging with her small body.</p><br/><p>Horrible, right~? Right~?</p><br/><p>Should we kill it? Kill it?</p><br/><p>But, but, but, but, it killed the golem, right?</p><br/><p>Impossible. Impossible. We\u2019ll be killed!</p><br/><p>How noisy.</p><br/><p>My head was filled with their chatter.</p><br/><p>\u300cBesides, you are cheating! Why aren\u2019t you affected by\u300eThought Manipulation\u300f!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been too long since we last met someone like you!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t she furious.</p><br/><p>I see, so the strange anger I feel towards them is due to me resisting their\u300eThought Manipualtion\u300fright?</p><br/><p>However, there\u2019s no way anyone among these fairies (brats) is a demon lord. Are they still messing with me?</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, next time you lie come up with a more believable one.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way anyone among you brats is a demon lord! \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t call us brats! Seriously, how rude. What else am I, if not a demon lord!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? An idiot? Anyways, speaking of demon lords, you know how stupid your claim sounds in comparison to my friend Milim?</p><br/><p>Compared to her, you guys are\u2026 pathetic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStupid!</p><br/><p>Stupidstupidstupidstupid!!! You are so stupid~!!!!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The spirit named Ramiris loudly shouted and then stopped to catch her breath.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cListen here.</p><br/><p>When you say Milim, surely you refer to that unreasonable demon lord Milim.</p><br/><p>The one that solves everything through brute force.</p><br/><p>To compare that unreasonable brute to the beautiful I, aren\u2019t you just being rude?</p><br/><p>Hey, I\u2019ll be troubled if you can\u2019t understand that much!\u300d</p><br/><p>Her words full of indignation.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cBesides, aren\u2019t you a strange one yourself?</p><br/><p>What was that? Did you have to suddenly use that dangerous skill!</p><br/><p>How many special skills must you possess to use that hell flare?</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t be so unreasonable.</p><br/><p>Ah, whatever.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not even surprised that you\u2019re that Milim\u2019s acquaintance; I believe you.</p><br/><p>So, believe me as well!\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, she might not be lying after all.</p><br/><p>Well, you know? They look pretty harmless up close.</p><br/><p>And, they actually listen when you sit down to talk to them.</p><br/><p>For some reason, I was preparing the snacks.</p><br/><p>If I am the guest, why are our roles reversed?</p><br/><p>Not that I care.</p><br/><p>The kids have gotten friendly with the fairies and are happily munching on some snacks together. With a satisfied smile.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the golem that freaked us out was meant to be shown after we have had our fun.</p><br/><p>In fact, they didn\u2019t intend to kill us or hurt us.</p><br/><p>Which is why,</p><br/><p>\u300cAaaah\u2026 and we we had just finished making it from all those parts\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She complained begrudgingly.</p><br/><p>Nothing can be done about it now. If I don\u2019t kill it, it\u2019ll kill me\u2013so I thought back then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you know just how efficient it was?</p><br/><p>Earth Spirits manipulated the weight,</p><br/><p>Water spirits moved each individual joint,</p><br/><p>Fire spirits provided its power,</p><br/><p>Wind spirits regulated the temperature.</p><br/><p>Combination of many chemical elements. It was the epitome of the genius of the Ghost Researchers\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s surprisingly persistent.</p><br/><p>If I knew it was going to end up like this, I would have eaten it and made a copy. Though I don\u2019t know if I could have done so\u2026</p><br/><p>But, genius of the Ghost Researchers? Does that have anything to do with Kaijin\u2019s story\u2013the one about the \u201cMagic Soldiers\u201d plan the dwarfs had undertaken withe the elves?</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, are you talking about the magic soldiers that the dwarfs and elves have been researching together?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBingo, bingoooo!!!</p><br/><p>How did you know! It went wild after they failed to use the heart\u2013the Spirit Magic Circuits!</p><br/><p>So, we picked up the shell that they threw out!</p><br/><p>Does that make us\u2026 geniuses? Are we that amazing?\u300d</p><br/><p>Annoying, but, yes, amazing.</p><br/><p>But, we are talking about Ghost Researchers who employ the power of ghosts, and fairies who are probably an existence close to that of ghosts\u2013in other words, I can accept their proficiency in regards to this question.</p><br/><p>Anyways, to summarize Ramiris\u2019 story: people tried to manipulate the power of ghosts to create a golem.</p><br/><p>Filling its body with magical energy as if blood, and pumping it with oil to make it move. And to control its weigh with magic.</p><br/><p>But it proved nonsensical.</p><br/><p>I mean, its magic supply would be cut off if it just jumped five meters away.</p><br/><p>However, were it made usable, it would become a terrifying weapon.</p><br/><p>Though Ramiris is an idiot, I guess she is amazing.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, I understand your awesomeness.</p><br/><p>Now, I have a request to this awesome you!\u300d</p><br/><p>I declared.</p><br/><p>Then, I explained the children\u2019s circumstances.</p><br/><p>Without hiding anything; truth and only the truth. The children listened intently.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, I see~</p><br/><p>I remembered. There was a guy who came here to try some things out.</p><br/><p>Leon, it was Leon-chan!</p><br/><p>He had not become a demon lord back then.</p><br/><p>Well, I could have taken him out with a single punch! No question! Seriously\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a lie.</p><br/><p>I mean, it\u2019s not a case where she is averting her eyes\u2013they are just spinning out of control.</p><br/><p>I listen to her story.</p><br/><p>One day, a young Leon showed up here.</p><br/><p>Ramiris\u2019\u300eThough Manipulation\u300fhad no effect.</p><br/><p>In fact, she was controlled in stead.</p><br/><p>For Ramiris, who was only proficient in\u3008Illusion Magic\u3009of the\u3008Spirit Magic\u3009archive, there was nothing else she could do.</p><br/><p>\u300cBesides, just as it happened with you, once illusion magic failed it was game over!</p><br/><p>I had not more cards to play, you know?</p><br/><p>This adorable Ramiris had no other plan.</p><br/><p>So, I planned to have the Golem become my arms and legs\u2026</p><br/><p>And silence the demon lords who constantly ridiculed\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s complaining again.</p><br/><p>Not completely disheartened, but certainly holding a grudge.</p><br/><p>Well, she then went out and lost to the not-yet-demon lord Leon, and had to help him out.</p><br/><p>It seems he was researching things\u2013knowledge on how to summon ghosts.</p><br/><p>Without a single clue, he had managed to summon a high level fire spirit out of pure anger and then sent him away.</p><br/><p>The fairies were dumbfounded when he told them.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd then, he had this absurd request. To summon World Travelers, special individuals from other worlds!</p><br/><p>Stop asking for the impossible. Are you an idiot!</p><br/><p>He looked about to cry when I said that\u2026</p><br/><p>No! Really, he started crying!</p><br/><p>Yeah. I am not exaggerating in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Pathetic~!!!</p><br/><p>A crybaby but so cheeky! Idiot!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Why\u2019s she getting excited all on her own?</p><br/><p>Is this a demon lord? Thank goodness. Had the first demon lord I met been this, I would consider them a miserable existence.</p><br/><p>But, is she going to be fine? If someone learns of her malicious gossip, she\u2019ll be erased, no\u2026?</p><br/><p>I mean I can easily squash her.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey\u2026</p><br/><p>You are thinking something rude right now, aren\u2019t you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, not at all?\u300d</p><br/><p>Though she\u2019s looking at me with suspicion, let\u2019s not forget that she\u2019s an idiot.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s easy to fool.</p><br/><p>By the way, the conversation got side tracked.</p><br/><p>The point is, I want to have high ranked spirits stop the children\u2019s collapse.</p><br/><p>Though I can\u2019t expect much from this idiot, I still decided to ask.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, in that case, I was wondering whether a spirit could stop the body\u2019s breakdown.</p><br/><p>What do you think?\u300d</p><br/><p>Her expression became serious.</p><br/><p>She looked at the children\u2013at each of their faces.</p><br/><p>She could make a face like that? One truly unbefitting of a demon lord\u2013filled with love.</p><br/><p>\u300cUm. You know, while I am a demon lord, I am also the saints\u2019 guide.</p><br/><p>I bestow divine protection on heroes.</p><br/><p>So worry not! I am fair.</p><br/><p>I, this person before you, preserved the balance of the entire world!\u300d</p><br/><p>So? What\u2019s the point?</p><br/><p>While I was thinking that, she turned to face me,</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright. I will help with the summoning. We\u2019ll summon the best spirits there are!\u300d</p><br/><p>She so declared.</p><br/><p>Thus, I was taught about spirits by Ramiris.</p><br/><p>A spirit is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIn nothingness power finds its fill.</p><br/><p>That is a holy spirit. The great holy spirit is the source of power.</p><br/><p>Among these, light and darkness, the two great spirits.</p><br/><p>Who came to exist at the same moment as the world.</p><br/><p>But, the world was without form, a ephemeral existence.</p><br/><p>Light and shadow, darkness and the light. Two existences that shall never interweave.</p><br/><p>One day, the great spirit time was born.</p><br/><p>The child of light and darkness.</p><br/><p>And thus the world began to move.</p><br/><p>The moving world spun, without purpose, around itself.</p><br/><p>Inside the flowing currents of life and death,</p><br/><p>Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Sky\u2013these five great spirits were born.</p><br/><p>And since then, these were the great eight spirits.</p><br/><p>Until the light consumes the world, erasing darkness,</p><br/><p>Until a new spirit is born, erasing all.</p><br/><p>Life and death.</p><br/><p>Heralding the coming end of the world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Is what she said.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn other words, first the holy spirit had existed, and it gave birth to the other eight!\u300d</p><br/><p>Splendid\u2026 right? For a myth, it surprisingly lacks gods.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this is the truth of this world.</p><br/><p>By the way, great spirits did not have ego\u2013they were masses of energy.</p><br/><p>The Fire Spirit was just an excess fragment of the entire mass.</p><br/><p>Like a monster, this fragment gained self awareness.</p><br/><p>And this self-aware fragment of pure energy thus became a monster.</p><br/><p>In a few words\u2013paranormal phenomena is what it is. Not that I understand, or want to understand.</p><br/><p>But, I do get what she wants us to do.</p><br/><p>The point is,</p><br/><p>\u300cCreate another fragment, is that it?\u300d</p><br/><p>Ramiris nods.</p><br/><p>To give birth to a new spirit. If not that, then call forth an existing one.</p><br/><p>Not an easy task.</p><br/><p>Since they are capable of thought, it will be difficult to make a spirit obey.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I don\u2019t know whether the kids can handle it.</p><br/><p>Even so.</p><br/><p>We have no choice but to try.</p><br/><p>Either we summon a spirit that can fix our problems, or one that possesses the kids.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll solve that problem when we get there.</p><br/><p>I look at the kids.</p><br/><p>They are all staring at me with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cYeah!\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>A stupid question.</p><br/><p>All that\u2019s left is to have some faith and try it out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

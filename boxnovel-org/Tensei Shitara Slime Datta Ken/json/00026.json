That is, other than some special magic items, I could not equip anything.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like I feel cold or anything, but I want some extra defense.</p><br/><p>Equipment that could protect me from at least one hit.</p><br/><p>Besides, the dwarfs have made many articles with the materials the goblins have hunted.</p><br/><p>First and foremost, I\u2019ll have a set of kids clothing prepared.</p><br/><p>Thus, I went to the dwarfs.</p><br/><p>Or more precisely, to the tailoring log cabin which was recently finished\u2026 apparently.</p><br/><p>The eldest dwarf Garm was busy ordering the girls (Goblinas), and overseeing production.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! Garm-kun. There\u2019s some clothing I want you to make me!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026 Danna. What are you saying? How are you planning on wearing it? You can\u2019t use equipment, can\u2019t you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu. Fuhaha, haaaaahahahaha! Don\u2019t look down on me!</p><br/><p>You thought it was the \u201ccan\u2019t wear anything\u201d me, huh! Well, not anymore! Haaaaaaaaa!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWha\u2026 what!!! Danna\u2018s body is growing\u2026 not. A kid, huh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTch. Not suprised, eh\u2026 Oh well. I can become an adult, but I want you to first make some clothing for this form!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cO.. okay. Then, we\u2019ll start by measuring your size! Oi, Haruna. I leave Danna\u2018s measurements to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>I was measured by one of the tailors, Haruna.</p><br/><p>Of course, although I was naked, I was not embarrassed. Since there\u2019s nothing there\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cMy! How cute you\u2019ve become, Rimuru-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>Haruna said while recording my size.</p><br/><p>Cute? I mean, I know I think I\u2019m cute, but for the goblins to agree.</p><br/><p>Must say, I\u2019m surprised that monsters even have an aesthetic sense.</p><br/><p>I decided to spend the following day by trying out my new skills.</p><br/><p>I head off.</p><br/><p>If I want to peacefully try out new skills, it\u2019s best for no one to be around.</p><br/><p>Having notified Rigurdo of my absence, I ordered everyone to steer clear.</p><br/><p>And, through the center of the city, I head into the cave.</p><br/><p>The place where I met Veldora.</p><br/><p>That underground cavern is wide, unnaturally dense, and, most of all, uninhabited.</p><br/><p>The cave\u2019s monsters stay away out of fear.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s start testing these out.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve got, unique skill [Shapeshifter], extra skill [Fire Manipulation].</p><br/><p>From the Flame Giant, [Clone], [Fire State], and [Area Boundary].</p><br/><p>So what should I start with\u2026</p><br/><p>Since cloning seems promising let\u2019s start with the Flame Giant.</p><br/><p>Fire State, huh. Wouldn\u2019t activate as a slime.</p><br/><p>Chances are, this skill activates only under certain conditions\u2026 I wonder what they are.</p><br/><p>As for Area Boundary, that I could use. But, I don\u2019t get it.</p><br/><p>So the point of the skill is to seal thermal energy within a barrier and prevent any from leaking, huh?</p><br/><p>But if I can activate this skill, why can\u2019t I use [Fire State]\u2026 wait a second. Didn\u2019t I just get my hands on a barrier?</p><br/><p>Okay.</p><br/><p>In the first place, this skill\u2019s main strength seems to be in trapping opponents. Quite a versatile skill, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>The boundaries maximum range is 100 meters, shaped into half a sphere. Does not expand underground.</p><br/><p>The smallest I could get it was just enough to cover my body. It\u2019s effect did not change. Only the size did.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s strength?</p><br/><p>I create a clone on top of which I affixed the boundary.</p><br/><p>Then, I shot out a water blade at the barrier. \u201cBashii!!!\u201d It was repelled.</p><br/><p>Hoho\u2026 It\u2019s that strong?</p><br/><p>In that case, let\u2019s try out the [Paralysis Breath] and [Noxious Breath].</p><br/><p>That experiment showed that the skill uses up a lot of magical energy.</p><br/><p>With the energy I left with the clone, the barrier withstood [Paralysis Breath] without taking any damage, but collapsed under [Noxious Breath].</p><br/><p>In other words, as long as I supply magical energy, the barrier will hold.</p><br/><p>Then, I created a clone with considerable amount of magical energy, and set up a barrier.</p><br/><p>I am planning on trying out the Black Wolf\u2019s [Black Lightning] skill.</p><br/><p>As a black wolf, it is possible to modify the range and strength of the skill.</p><br/><p>Its two long horns are used to alter just that.</p><br/><p>Since a slime has no horns, \u201cUse it all!\u201d is how the skill works.</p><br/><p>Thus, I set the power to max and the range to a single target\u2026 fire!</p><br/><p>As for the barrier, I set it to its lowest setting. If the size is small, the consumption should also decrease.</p><br/><p>The result,</p><br/><p>*Pika! \u2026.. Chudooooooooon!!!*</p><br/><p>Not even the dust was left.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s too dangerous!</p><br/><p>So\u2026 I guess I can\u2019t trust in the barrier all that much.</p><br/><p>In the first place, why did he disappear if I have electric current resistance and thermal fluctuation resistance?</p><br/><p>Somehow this makes no sense.</p><br/><p>Maybe this [Black Lightning] skill is actually a special skill ranked about extra skills.</p><br/><p>But man this sent a chill down my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood thing I didn\u2019t carelessly try it on myself!\u201d Such were my honest thoughts.</p><br/><p>However, the fact that I need to mimic a black wolf to use this skill greatly limits its applicability.</p><br/><p>Then, I mimicked the flame giant, and tried to use [Fire State] again.</p><br/><p>The result was that I changed into a 2000 degree cloud. But, as expected, the heat dissipates too quickly if I don\u2019t maintain the barrier.</p><br/><p>This skill, too, highly depends on the situation.</p><br/><p>By the way, when I use it with the barrier, [Fire State] is an amazing skill.</p><br/><p>As expected of an A rank (+?).</p><br/><p>That is, [Freya Sphere] is a combination of the barrier and fire state that burns the opponent from the inside; in other words, any living thing that breathes air will surely perish.</p><br/><p>My affinity against the opponent was really good!</p><br/><p>As for how to use the skill, I\u2019ll consider that later.</p><br/><p>Now with respect to extra skill [Fire Manipulation].</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t seem to explode things like Shizu-san did. What the trick could be, I don\u2019t know\u2026</p><br/><p>Light a fire at my finger tip, throw fire from the palm of my hand\u2013such party tricks are easy.</p><br/><p>Also, I managed to gather heat in my hand and radiate it, thus creating a Fire Blaster.</p><br/><p>And wait, if I gather the heat, the power increases.</p><br/><p>I mean, normally, fire is at about 200 degrees Celsius. If I gather it, it rises to 1600 degrees.</p><br/><p>Now, just like with \u201cWater Blade\u201d, I just need to shoot out this magical energy.</p><br/><p>It struck my target at 10 meters away with a temperature surpassing 1400 degrees. This splendid skill I decided to call \u201cFlame Bullet\u201d.</p><br/><p>Looks just like a certain alien\u2019s finisher, finger beam.</p><br/><p>Also, I can probably just create a fireball in my hand and burn my opponents.</p><br/><p>Would I do something as dangerous as grabbing someone\u2019s head and threatening to burn them? Yeah, I probably would.</p><br/><p>Additionally, since it seems I can further raise the temperature with practice, I should continue doing so until I can manage an explosion.</p><br/><p>After all, unlike monsters\u2019 skills, it\u2019s practice makes perfect here.</p><br/><p>Now then, regarding the last new skill.</p><br/><p>That is, [Shapeshifter].</p><br/><p>That name sounds too much like shoplifter\u2026 how unpleasant.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t be awakening to any criminal tendencies, will I\u2026</p><br/><p>Not that I even fall asleep.</p><br/><p>Anyways, let\u2019s try out the skill.</p><br/><p>But, I have absolutely no idea how to do that.</p><br/><p>At a time like this, [Great Sage] saves the day! Sensei! Please!!!</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cSolution. The effects of Unique Skill [Shapeshifter]</p><br/><p>Fusion: The ability to merge into a single being with the targeted fellow.</p><br/><p>Division: The ability to separate oneself and the being possessing you.</p><br/><p>(If the target who is being separated lacks a physical form, they could disappear)</p><br/><p>These two abilities are yours to wield.\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>So Shizu-san\u2019s devil appearance was the result of this unique skill, huh?</p><br/><p>Just my first impressions, but wouldn\u2019t this skill mix well with mine?</p><br/><p>Although this slime body doesn\u2019t sweat, I certainly felt cold sweat at that thought.</p><br/><p>This is essentially the first step in understanding an opponents abilities. But, more importantly, can\u2019t I use this to erase their skills?</p><br/><p>\uff1c\uff1cSolution. Skills engraved upon the soul can neither be separated nor destroyed.\uff1e\uff1e</p><br/><p>Sadly, it wasn\u2019t that omnipotent.</p><br/><p>But, I am certain that it will mix well with my skills.</p><br/><p>For example, could I combine with the monsters I mimic?</p><br/><p>Shizu-san had combined with the Ifrit who resided in her consciousness, could I also become a devil this way?</p><br/><p>Devil transformation should be something like overwriting original body\u2019s abilities with the desired one.</p><br/><p>Perhaps as an option, I can also change my physical appearance.</p><br/><p>Thus, I try to imagine it.</p><br/><p>To overlay the Flame Giants abilities on top of the slime.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t planning on anything gaudy, but had my face raise its temperature to 200 degrees.</p><br/><p>Seems like I can now use [Fire State] even in this form.</p><br/><p>Upon activating that skill, my aura had become that of a flame. My \u201cfacial\u201d temperature also rose over 1400 degrees.</p><br/><p>Seems like this could be used as a weapon now.</p><br/><p>If I am ever captured, I could probably use this to escape.</p><br/><p>Thus, I tried fusing with every monster I had eaten thus far.</p><br/><p>The spider gave me white spots.</p><br/><p>As a centipede, I grew fangs. Gross.</p><br/><p>The lizard had me grow scales.</p><br/><p>The bat\u2026 made me sprout demon like wings. A slime with demon\u2019s wings. Looks pretty cool actually.</p><br/><p>As the black wolf, I turned black and grew two horns. Horns like those of a unicorn.</p><br/><p>But because I can\u2019t see, I actually still worry about where exactly the horns are placed.</p><br/><p>Next, the black snake. My body was covered in a gold pattern.</p><br/><p>Now, even as a slime, I can fully use every skill.</p><br/><p>As for the visual\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, could I fuse multiple times?</p><br/><p>The answer, yes. However, no more than twice.</p><br/><p>I could not manage a third. However, most of the monster\u2019s skills do not require fusion.</p><br/><p>Even if the potency of the skill decreases, as long as I can actually use it, I don\u2019t see much of a problem.</p><br/><p>The skills I actually need to transform for are\u2026 [Fire State], and [Black Lighting]\u2013just them.</p><br/><p>Although not a skill, I do need to mimic the bat in order to use its flight abilities. I can grow flightless wings, however.</p><br/><p>Therefore, flame Giant, Black Wolf, or Giant Bat\u2013choose two of these according to the situation at hand; that will probably become the basic strategy from now on.</p><br/><p>Well, as long as their abilities are useful, of course.</p><br/><p>By the way, if I try to fuse while mimicking\u2026</p><br/><p>I can mix a total of three bodies.</p><br/><p>Thus, I\u2019ve become a chimera. Thank you very much\u2026</p><br/><p>No, actually, the intimidating power of the monsters doesn\u2019t change all that much.</p><br/><p>The black wolf and snake are, after all, the most dangerous of the ones I have.</p><br/><p>Whichever I use as a base, the power doesn\u2019t change much, but the black wolf is a far superior base due to an inherently higher speed.</p><br/><p>So when I\u2019m in a real pinch, I\u2019ll be depending on him as usual.</p><br/><p>How, then, do the abilities change when the base is human? Was my next thought.</p><br/><p>Human\u2019s form primary merit is the ability to equip things.</p><br/><p>Whereas any monster and magic beast I mimic will inadvertently be lacking equipment.</p><br/><p>Further, there are certainly powerful skills to be used while in human forms.</p><br/><p>But for now, let me discuss the visual changes,</p><br/><p>Flame Giant: My hair and eyes turned crimson.</p><br/><p>Black Wolf: My hair turned black, with two cowlicks sticking out\u2026 where are the ears and tail, damn it!!!</p><br/><p>Black Serpent: My eyes turned green and snake like. Hands and feet became covered in scales and grew claws.</p><br/><p>Giant Bat: I grew demon wings.</p><br/><p>The skills I cannot use without mimicking are the same as before.</p><br/><p>So if I obtain some cursed swords in the future, this appearance may become the norm for combat.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, I should probably try making one of those.</p><br/><p>If anything, I can fuse with inorganic substances as well.</p><br/><p>What would that mean? Probably gaining special attributes and abilities inherent to the weapon or something.</p><br/><p>While this is certainly something I would like to test out, I really don\u2019t know anything about this topic.</p><br/><p>Besides, to defeat the demon lord, shouldn\u2019t I be searching for some holy sword?</p><br/><p>Well, when I enter some kingdom, I\u2019ll look around.</p><br/><p>\u2026 I completely forgot to test out my resistances.</p><br/><p>First to note, along with extra skill [Flame Manipulation] I had acquired Fire Attack Resistance.</p><br/><p>But even so, surely if I were thrown into the sun I\u2019d burn and die.</p><br/><p>Thus, the question is how much can I resist? This, I just have to test with my own abilities.</p><br/><p>Up until now, I feared receiving damages, and avoided such practice, but I am a different slime today!</p><br/><p>Just as I had considered while testing [Black Lightning] before, it\u2019s time to experiment on my own body.</p><br/><p>I have to find out just how much damage I can endure.</p><br/><p>Though I worry slightly, this experiment is absolutely crucial.</p><br/><p>I create a clone and control him. Of course, as a slime. If I did this while looking like a child, what would the readers think?!</p><br/><p>The current clone looks like a child, but I can also make one of a slime.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, if I get used to this, it seems like I can also replicate the equipment I wore at the time of cloning.</p><br/><p>The cloning skill is only limited as far as your unique skills allow.</p><br/><p>First, [Great Sage]</p><br/><p>As long as the user is within a kilometer radius, a clone can be created.</p><br/><p>Should the user go beyond that limit, the consciousness link is severed, and the clone can only respond to basic commands.</p><br/><p>Since vision is always shared, and an order can be changed at any time, the clone can be used for long range reconnaissance missions.</p><br/><p>Second, [Predator]</p><br/><p>The stomach can only release the true body.</p><br/><p>A clone can be predated and stored, but cannot be extracted.</p><br/><p>However, feedback regarding skills, etc. can be acquired.</p><br/><p>Third, [Shapeshifter]</p><br/><p>Only one fusion is allowed. Division is unchanged.</p><br/><p>Upon extensive research a few limitations were revealed, but the skill remains pretty powerful.</p><br/><p>Thus, I sparred a few times with my clone.</p><br/><p>The result, \u201cWater Blade\u201d is very powerful.</p><br/><p>Black serpent falls after a single attack. Black wolf, after two. The rest you can guess yourself.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlame Bullet\u201d is only a beam shot from my fingertips, but terrifyingly powerful.</p><br/><p>However, as a piercing attack, the enemies death is not guaranteed. While their head and vitals become their weak points, I have to hit those first.</p><br/><p>For example, although I had shot through the snake\u2019s head, it did not fall. Had I let my guard down, I might have been defeated.</p><br/><p>Thus, although it\u2019s stronger than \u201cWater Blade\u201d, it\u2019s harder to kill with.</p><br/><p>I had accepted this point too easily.</p><br/><p>The strongest skill is [Black Lightning]</p><br/><p>The strongest pair is [Black Wolf and Flame Giant]\u2013the clone didn\u2019t immediately die with barrier and fire state invoked.</p><br/><p>Rather, I have to say that I somehow managed to defeat it.</p><br/><p>Perhaps its best to think of fire state as a defensive rather offensive skill.</p><br/><p>Even so, other than the strongest combination, no skills found thus far can defend against it.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, while mimicking, if enough damage is received, I return back to normal; however, the damage incurred is not transmitted to the true body.</p><br/><p>Thus, if I die from a single attack, it can properly be called an overkill.</p><br/><p>And thus, I\u2019ve obtained various data.</p><br/><p>The rest can be verified via [Great Sage]\u2019s simulations.</p><br/><p>Taking on the appearance of a child, I begin to leave.</p><br/><p>Along the way, I encountered a centipede\u2026 who quickly ran away at the sight of me.</p><br/><p>Fufufu. My presence has finally been recognized.</p><br/><p>Although to the eyes I look just like a child!</p><br/><p>Status</p><br/><p>Name: Rimuru Tempest</p><br/><p>Species: Slime (Human-transformation possible)</p><br/><p>Divine Protection: the Storm Crest</p><br/><p>Titles: One who Commands Monsters</p><br/><p>Magic: None</p><br/><p>Skills: Unique Skill [Great Sage], Unique Skill [Predator], Slime-Specific Skills [Dissolve, Absorb, Regenerate], Extra Skill [Water Manipulation], Extra Skill [Magic Perception], Acquired Skills: Black Serpent [Heat Detection, Noxious Breath], Centipede [Paralysis Breath], Spider [Sticky Thread, Steel Threat], Bat [Ultrasound Waves], Lizard [Body Armor], Wolf [Supreme Sense of Smell, Telepathic Communication, Intimidation, Shadow Step, Black Lightning], Fire Giant [Clone, Fire State, Area Boundary]</p><br/><p>Resistances: Thermal Fluctuation Resistance EX, Physical Attack Resistance, Pain Resistance, Fire Attack Resistance, Electricity Resistance, Paralysis Resistance</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>END OF THE EMPOWERMENT ARC</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Some Translator Notes and Trivia:</p><br/><p>Rimuru\u2019s temperature: I know she/he is hot.

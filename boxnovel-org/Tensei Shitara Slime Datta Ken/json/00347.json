Behind you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2013Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman\u2019s scream did not reach him.</p><br/><p>Beretta moved faster than the speed of sound itself as his thin arms pierced and shredded the Powered Suit.</p><br/><p>Numerous tentacles pulled Jogg out, and the empty Powered Suit crumbled to the ground.</p><br/><p>What had happened to the first man?</p><br/><p>He now understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cIm-impossible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026he got two of us in a second\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two others whispered to each other. Karman felt the same.</p><br/><p>However, unlike his men, who were merely shocked, Karman was thinking of a way out of this.</p><br/><p>(How did he move like that just now? It was as if space had moved\u2013could it be space teleportation!?)</p><br/><p>Moving that fast should cause shock waves.</p><br/><p>However, no such thing had occurred.</p><br/><p>He had moved faster than sound without affecting the atmosphere\u2013Karman had never heard of such a thing, not even as a rumor.</p><br/><p>So then\u2013it couldn\u2019t have been movement, but teleportation.</p><br/><p>And his thinking was close to the truth.</p><br/><p>Beretta\u2019s Ultimate Gift, \u2018Deus Ex Machina\u2019s\u2019 \u2018Space Manipulation,\u2019 allowed him to change his own position.</p><br/><p>It was limited to an area that he could see, but it was the same thing as teleportation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Sto-stop!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A third man was caught by Beretta now.</p><br/><p>Karman saw this and moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. Don\u2019t underestimate me!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had readied his Neutron Launcher after the second man had fallen, and he now fired it without hesitation.</p><br/><p>It was possible that he would hit his own men, but he had decided that it was a sacrifice he was willing to make in order to take down the monster that was Beretta.</p><br/><p>The neutron beam turned into a missile that shot towards Beretta at the speed of light.</p><br/><p>The effect would be the transfer of an immense amount of kinetic energy as a reaction of colliding with the target, turning the target into hot plasma.</p><br/><p>\u2013Or it should have.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what the\u2026 IMPOOSSSIBBLEEE!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A phenomenon that was so unreal was occurring before Karman\u2019s very eyes.</p><br/><p>The neutron beam had changed course right before hitting Beretta and disappeared into the ceiling.</p><br/><p>In Karman\u2019s machine-assisted vision, he could see the afterglow of the neutron beam as it reacted with the atomic nucleus in the atmosphere and turned into plasma before disappearing into the ceiling.</p><br/><p>There was enough information to assure him that this was no observation error.</p><br/><p>Beretta was still standing there.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t idle.</p><br/><p>Crunch, Crack, Snap\u2013the eerie sounds erupted as the tips of Beretta\u2019s tentacles worked to destroy the Powered Suit it had removed.</p><br/><p>This process seemed like a display of Beretta\u2019s fury, and Karman could not help but feel a sense of dread.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha-what\u2026did you just do?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could no longer stand the sight, and so he asked the question.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even expect an answer, but it came surprisingly quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is simple. I determined the nature of the attack and I dealt with it accordingly. I suppose it is a weapon that gathers together particles and unleashes it at a tremendous speed. A frightful thing, however\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Beretta, before continuing.</p><br/><p>It seemed simple enough to alter the angle of space and send the beam off-course.</p><br/><p>Because as long as the particles did not react to the atomic nucleus of the target, it was not a threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo-you are saying you understood it after the first attack? But, how are you unharmed!? I saw you get hit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnharmed? You ruined the mask that Lord Rimuru gave to me. And you say \u2018unharmed\u2019!! And not only that, but this face that should be hidden\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta looked like he was trying to control his anger.</p><br/><p>While the hole in his stomach seemed like it should have been the bigger problem, he was more preoccupied with the mask he held in his hands.</p><br/><p>Beretta was terribly warped and this was making it harder for Karman to think clearly.</p><br/><p>However, just then, the last of Karman\u2019s men who had been waiting for such an opportunity, attacked Beretta from behind.</p><br/><p>The hands of the Powered Suits had a number of barrels on them. And now one of them unleashed a rainbow of light.</p><br/><p>It was thermal plasma.</p><br/><p>It came from a thermonuclear reactor and was launched as a weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did it!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He screamed. And the incredible heat assaulted Beretta\u2014and yet, not a single hair from his beautiful silver locks was burnt.</p><br/><p>Beretta stood completely unhurt amidst the assault of the colorful plasma.</p><br/><p>It was a mystical sight. So much so that Karman stared at him in a state of awe.</p><br/><p>And then\u2013</p><br/><p>Beretta chuckled softly.</p><br/><p>The only reason Beretta had taken damage the first time the Neutron Launcher was used, was because it was an unknown attack.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

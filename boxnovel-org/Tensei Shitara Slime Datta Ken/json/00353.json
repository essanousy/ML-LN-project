What do you want? As I am in a good mood, I will listen to whatever you have to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>He said.</p><br/><p>Everyone who watched became pale by his attitude.</p><br/><p>It was not known if Michelle would act like this for long. It would not be surprising if she suddenly became very hostile.</p><br/><p>But there was no one who could react in time.</p><br/><p>This was because no one would have ever believed that someone could act like his in front of a Mercenary Four.</p><br/><p>No one could have imagined that anyone would try so hard to provoke and anger her.</p><br/><p>Well, perhaps he was not provoking her that much. It wouldn\u2019t have seemed like it if she were an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>But she was the leader of the Empire.</p><br/><p>They were not sure what reaction would be had from such insolence from a nobody like Veldora.</p><br/><p>And so they could only watch it unfold.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is nothing really. I just thought I\u2019d nip things in the bud before they turn into a disaster for the Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe. In other words, you mean to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can take it in whichever way you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michelle and Veldora took no notice of the spectators as they continued their conversation.</p><br/><p>Neither seemed very eager. It was as if they were talking about the weather.</p><br/><p>But Zaza watched with a feeling that reminded him of an upset stomach, even though he didn\u2019t have one.</p><br/><p>He was waiting for the right time where he could enter the conversation and change the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa-wait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just as Zaza tried to interrupt them, that Ramiris began poking him in the shoulder.</p><br/><p>And then she whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, this is just my opinion. But we better let Master do something soon, or he\u2019ll get angry, which will be very bad\u2026 Besides, I don\u2019t think that person is serious. Why don\u2019t we just let him handle things this once?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaza reluctantly agreed.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t persuaded by her argument, but he felt that it would do Veldora good to feel a little pain.</p><br/><p>After all, Michelle suddenly looked very different.</p><br/><p>There was something very overpowering about her now, and Zaza could not even open his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris was also surprised and wide-eyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is\u2014!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta quickly moved to protect Ramiris.</p><br/><p>He felt that the air around Veldora had changed. The other adults also started to move the children away\u2026</p><br/><p>And when they were done\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, are you ready? Give it all you got. I will show you how outmatched you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>Veldora declared.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Michelle had come out herself for a certain purpose.</p><br/><p>After hearing the report from Colonel Gratham, she had waited anxiously for the next report.</p><br/><p>It just wasn\u2019t possible for the resistance to create new weapons with their technology.</p><br/><p>And so there were two possibilities.</p><br/><p>The first was that survivors from the fallen city had secretly developed it.</p><br/><p>The second was that one of the other cities had developed it and were \u2018test-driving\u2019 it.</p><br/><p>There was no way that the resistance could create something that was as good as the Empire\u2019s best.</p><br/><p>The reason was clear. They did not have the personnel, facilities or materials.</p><br/><p>And so the possibility of it being made by survivors of the fallen city was very unlikely to her.</p><br/><p>In any case, she would only need to see the results of Karma\u2019s battle to know for sure\u2014that is what Michelle thought\u2026</p><br/><p>While Second Lieutenant Karman had issues with his temper, he was very strong. And so she had no doubt that he would succeed.</p><br/><p>However, she received a most astonishing report.</p><br/><p>\u2018Te-terrible news! Karman and his men have entered a battle with the enemy, but it seems that they have been defeated\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>First Lieutenant Hiragi\u2019s report was relayed in a trembling voice last night.</p><br/><p>And so Michelle talked with Jegyll, her adjutant.</p><br/><p>First Lieutenant Hiragi was ordered to continue his monitoring. And Michelle and Jegyll discussed the report.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Karman had the latest Powered Suits. They should be nearly as strong as Cyborg Soldiers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. They are inferior in terms of catalog specs, but they are equal in terms of weaponry. Perhaps this means they were defeated before it became a match of firepower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michelle agreed with Jegyll\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>But then again, it seemed very odd that the five of them were together and yet they did not have a chance to use their weapons\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, we cannot ignore something that is strong enough to defeat Karman and his men.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We should send a special attack corps and have them deal with this mystery enemy. At the same time, I will contact the other cities and find out if they have been conducting experiments with secret weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that is good. Thank you, Jegyll.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye! Leave it to me, Michelle.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that conclusion reached, preparations were made on the same night.</p><br/><p>Jegyll contacted all of the other cities, but she could gather no information concerning the mystery enemy.</p><br/><p>Which meant that it really was from the fallen city\u2014or\u2026</p><br/><p>If it was the result of secret experiments, they were not likely to admit to it.</p><br/><p>And so Jegyll requested permission to have the thing destroyed, and the three other cities agreed to it.</p><br/><p>While there were official procedures for such emergencies, they just sent word that they would not make an issue of it in the future. And so it was settled.</p><br/><p>(\u2014So, did that mean that the other cities really weren\u2019t involved\u2026?)</p><br/><p>While Michelle wasn\u2019t certain, she decided it must be so.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, then they could not avoid destroying the thing, as it was a possible threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing defeated Karman and his men. Do not think about capturing it. Destroy it as quickly as possible. All restrictions will be\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Michelle was about to send out the special attack corps, First Lieutenant Hirgagi made an emergency call.</p><br/><p>\u2018We have confirmed that Second Lieutenant Karman is alive! However\u2026as unbelievable as it may seem, he appears to have betrayed us\u2014\u2019</p><br/><p>He said.</p><br/><p>First Lieutenant Hiragi had been monitoring the sound waves and had been able to hear them. That was his report.</p><br/><p>Everyone that was present became speechless by this.</p><br/><p>But then the rest of the report came.</p><br/><p>They had been shocked by the word \u2018betrayed,\u2019 but it seemed that he had only said something sympathetic towards the resistance.</p><br/><p>They were just exaggerating and making a fuss about it, saying it was a betrayal of the Empire.</p><br/><p>First Lieutenant Hiragi was well known for swearing allegiance to the Empire, and judging ho</p><br/><p>w loyal he was, he would not allow his friendship with Karman to affect him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

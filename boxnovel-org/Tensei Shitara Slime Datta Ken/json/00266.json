Or rather, because of them and their leaking aura, the terrain transformed into this abnormal environment.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, there is a forest but as there\u2019s also a ruler living there, it was connected to a jungle.</p><br/><p>To be honest, as there are rulers on all four sides, it will be difficult for the search team.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt that it will be easier for the people staying back.</p><br/><p>And as such, I am in the staying behind group.</p><br/><p>Tear is supposed to be protecting the search groups from the shadows so I don\u2019t have a role to play there. *</p><br/><p>Or rather, now that I am at human level, I would have trouble even with unique monsters, semi demon lord seed level is way out of the question.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\"></div><br/><p>To be more precise, if I get even a bit serious, my identity will be revealed and it would be game over.</p><br/><p>And so, I will be among the non-combatants.</p><br/><p>I want it to be clear that it\u2019s definitely not like I want to relax.</p><br/><p>Now then, about the work for the ones staying behind\u2013</p><br/><p>The job that looks most easy is setting up the tent for the equipments.</p><br/><p>A very thoroughly prepared instructor had outdoor training camp equipments in his \u2018space storage\u2019.</p><br/><p>It might just be that he thought it would be more troublesome to put them in storage but some things are better left unsaid.</p><br/><p>After all, he\u2019s all happy and what not from all the respect he\u2019s getting from the students so I will just leave it as him having a careful personality.</p><br/><p>Besides, the tent even has an insect repelling effect due to a simple magic circle. With space magic, the insides are also a bit more spacious so it\u2019s perfect for situations like this.</p><br/><p>There were 30 tents of which each can fit about 10 people and so we have more than enough space even if we make the tents gender-segregated.</p><br/><p>The way to set it up is rather simple\u2013you just need to break the magic seal on a flat surface and spread the tent. After that, you just need to put up all the sides.</p><br/><p>However, I am not a student of any academy so I am not supposed to know about breaking the magic seal.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s actually quite simple but if I were to do it, I would completely be labelled out as a suspicious person.</p><br/><p>And like this, I was inevitably put into the food supply group.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\">Translations by AsianHobbyist Website</div><br/><p>Looking at the other students put up the tents with a backward glance, we headed into the forest.</p><br/><p>Beside me was Mondo-kun\u2013the fat student from before.</p><br/><p>Although two instructors were leading about 30 students, that alone wouldn\u2019t be very secure so a battle type student was included in each group.</p><br/><p>We were also working with 5 members in a group, like Julius and the others.</p><br/><p>The relief squad was in the middle with the four collecting squads protecting them from all four sides.</p><br/><p>The relief squad also had registered each member of all groups so this arrangement was appropriate.</p><br/><p>Instructors are not included in the groups so we had a total of 27 people.</p><br/><p>Mondo-kun was also a battle type if it matters so he was chosen as one of the escorts for people heading into the forest.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-12\"></div><br/><p>I don\u2019t know all the students so I will just have to trust the instructors\u2019 judgement on the personnel selection.</p><br/><p>Well, Ciel-sensei isn\u2019t saying anything either so it\u2019s probably fine but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh~ahh, this is the worst~ To be protected by Mondo, out of all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who was whining beside was a girl named Marsha.</p><br/><p>She was the same girl who was with him a while ago and it seems they are childhood friends.</p><br/><p>Although she is complaining, she seems like she is having fun.</p><br/><p>However, the same couldn\u2019t be said about her friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, oi, I am here so you can rest easy. Well, sure, my results aren\u2019t as good enough for the search group but I am still quite good in actual battles, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight~ Compared to Mondo, I guess George is better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\">Translations by AsianHobbyist Website</div><br/><p>\u201cOi, what do you mean better?! Sure, I am in middle in the ranks but it hurts when you compare me with this low rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>The George kid said.</p><br/><p>And a red-haired girl nodded to that.</p><br/><p>Apparently her name is Aina. She has freckles but is a cute girl.</p><br/><p>George, Aina, Mondo and Marsha were my group mates.</p><br/><p>I was observing to get a grasp of the collecting group\u2019s personalities but it seems like Mondo-kun isn\u2019t really valued highly.</p><br/><p>Excluding me, it seems he has the lowest grades among the 4.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t seem like he was hated or anything. Rather, he felt like the mood maker of the group.</p><br/><p>It might be because of Mondo-kun that this group doesn\u2019t seem anxious.</p><br/><p>Although Mondo-kun might not be willing to be made fun of, it definitely is making the rest feel less stressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cE-even though you say that, I have things I am good at too, alright? I might be lacking stamina but my explosive power is above average, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStuupid. Being able to continue fights for a long ime is the most important\u2013even the instructor was saying that, remember?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Including Shuna and Kurobee, that is.</p><br/><p>They have all received one of my powers and exceeded my own abilities in them.</p><br/><p>Ranga\u2019s [Black Lightning]</p><br/><p>Benimaru\u2019s [Flame Manipulation]</p><br/><p>Shuna\u2019s [Analyst]</p><br/><p>Hakurou\u2019s [Perception Acceleration]</p><br/><p>Shion\u2019s [Herculean Strength] and Body Strengthening</p><br/><p>Souei\u2019s [Magic Perception] and special skills</p><br/><p>Kurobee\u2019s [Researcher]</p><br/><p>In every skill they exceed me.</p><br/><p>I can only be called strong because I have every skill that they do.</p><br/><p>If we fought one on one and I went all out, I think I could win. However, if all five gather, I would probably lose.</p><br/><p>And yet this orc surpassed all five of them.</p><br/><p>Never being able to land the finishing blow, they were bound to run out of magic energy and perish.</p><br/><p>So even if I fought the orc fair and square, I could never win.</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>Even if I fought fair and\u2026</p><br/><p>Why are the oni\u2018s skills stronger than mine?</p><br/><p>Hakurou is stronger because his sword skill level is so much higher.</p><br/><p>That much is perfectly understandable. But what about the rest?</p><br/><p>Actually\u2026 are they really stronger than me?</p><br/><p>The answer to that\u2026</p><br/><p>In the first place,</p><br/><p>All my abilities I have gained from monsters.</p><br/><p>Since they are not skills I was born with, I need to take time to properly understand them.</p><br/><p>Just like having a license does not necessarily mean you can drive a car right now, and certainly does not mean you can win against a professional driver.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>There is a skill I have had since the moment I reincarnated into this world.</p><br/><p>It is a skill I have had from birth.</p><br/><p>One that I can freely manipulate.</p><br/><p>That skill even I have nearly complete mastery of.</p><br/><p>Thus, I order.</p><br/><p>I permit you to control my body. Move it as you please, [Great Sage]!</p><br/><p>\u226aReceived. Switching to Battle Mode.\u226b</p><br/><p>And thus the response to the previous question,</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Orc Disaster was bewildered.</p><br/><p>Just as he had intended to cook and eat the five strong demons, another one had appeared.</p><br/><p>A boring monster, he had thought.</p><br/><p>The monster\u2019s magic energy was certainly high, easily surpassing that of the other five.</p><br/><p>However, the monster had continued meaningless attacks, each one just as weak.</p><br/><p>Ones even inferior to the five before him.</p><br/><p>No matter how often the monster would have attacked, no damage would accumulate. Thus, the orc did not feel threatened.</p><br/><p>Thus, just when he had designated the monster as a good meal\u2026</p><br/><p>The constant onslaught of attacks suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>And, she took of her mask.</p><br/><p>And the orc saw a beautiful young face of a silver haired girl.</p><br/><p>What is she planning?</p><br/><p>The moment he thought that,</p><br/><p>*Zasu!*</p><br/><p>His arm, elbow down, was cut away from his body. And where it used to be attached, a dark flame burned him.</p><br/><p>And when he looked, his enemy, with appearance of a child, held a melting sword engulfed in a dark flame.</p><br/><p>Enemy? Yes, that was an enemy.</p><br/><p>He had considered her food. Now, however, was different. There was an overwhelming difference with the presence now before him.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter that his foe\u2019s weapon had burned away. Her abilities were so high that she didn\u2019t need it!</p><br/><p>Having met an enemy for the first time since evolving, the Demon Lord Orc Disaster\u2019s body tensed\u2019.</p><br/><p>And another strange feeling.</p><br/><p>How strange\u2026 his arm had not started regenerating!</p><br/><p>Confused, he looked at where his arm had been only to find the dark flame still burning and sealing his regeneration.</p><br/><p>Anger burned in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Cutting his arm off at the shoulder, he had it regenerate. And, he started swinging the Butcher Knife \u201cMeat Crusher\u201d with all his might.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat small child cannot withstand even a single hit!:</p><br/><p>However. The seemingly unarmed child casually lifted her arms, produced a sword out of thin air, and received the attack.</p><br/><p>With the same sword that he had thought was burned by her skill.</p><br/><p>And when the butcher knife came in contact with the sword both were engulfed by the black flame and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must go all out to devour her!\u201d The Orc Disaster\u2019s aura swelled causing shockwaves on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Filling up his fists with his aura, he attacked. His enemy, too, armored her fists and repelled his attacks.</p><br/><p>He saw magic bullets flying at him. Dodging those, he responded with Gakki no Koushinenbu (Death March Dance).</p><br/><p>Colliding with the seven bullets in the air, his magic bullets continued on.</p><br/><p>They were strengthened with [Starving Ones] and had a corrosive effect.</p><br/><p>While she would probably not die from this, she\u2019d take some damage.</p><br/><p>Just as he had thought that, she stood up as if nothing happened.</p><br/><p>And a new armor was now covering her. His attack was probably deflected by that armor.</p><br/><p>It was true for him, so maybe his enemy was also in the middle of evolving.</p><br/><p>I hunger. I want to eat her!!!</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord Orc Disaster thought. The five before had not mattered, all he wanted was to eat the one before him!</p><br/><p>He grabbed onto his enemy.</p><br/><p>Since he was stronger, if he fought long enough, he\u2019d eventually crush her. Just when he thought that, his leg was crushed.</p><br/><p>A roundhouse kick landed into him causing his body to fall, but still he wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><br/><p>Releasing the yellow aura, he had it envelop his enemy.</p><br/><p>One of the effects of [Starving Ones] was to corrode and devour his enemies directly.</p><br/><p>And as his enemy\u2019s life dwindled, it would become his nutrients.</p><br/><p>I want to eat her! His head filled with that one though, he directed his entire being into corroding her!</p><br/><p>And, his enemy having given up struggling, gradually succumbed to\u2026</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Things proceeded just as I had planned.</p><br/><p>With the full support from the [Great Sage] I was able to use the skills to their full potential.</p><br/><p>A never before seen optimized form of combat. I can even use [Black Flame Manipulation] now.</p><br/><p>Moreover, [Body Armor] had changed into [Full Armor Transformation]. It further strengths my equipment.</p><br/><p>Skills I had previously hard time mastering I now easily control with the help from [Great Sage].</p><br/><p>However, it is still hard outdo your fundamental limitations. The longer this fight continues the stronger the Orc Disaster may grow.</p><br/><p>Even if I know how to use my skills, it\u2019s not like my overall proficiency with them has increased.</p><br/><p>The Orc Disaster as well has just evolved and has poor control over them. Thus, this advantage is clearly temporary.</p><br/><p>Which is why I must end this quickly.</p><br/><p>So I planned to lead the battle to a state where I can quickly overwhelm him with a skill I am superior at.</p><br/><p>And everything went according to plan.</p><br/><p>The Orc Disaster had begun corroding me, intending to devour.</p><br/><p>However, I also intend to devour you!</p><br/><p>I am a slime. My basic abilities are [Dissolve, Absorb, Regenerate].</p><br/><p>My regeneration ability is similar to his. However, the slime body is naturally resistant to corrosion.</p><br/><p>Thus, I had planned from the beginning to eat you in this manner!</p><br/><p>I made him believe that my body had melted, and used that to envelop him.</p><br/><p>Slowly moving up the arm\u2026</p><br/><p>And by the time he had noticed, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>This was the standard method of combat for the slime race.</p><br/><p>No matter how much he rages now, he\u2019s already been covered by me; his attacked nullified.</p><br/><p>Pointless, you must think? You pride yourself in your regenerative abilities, and my attack will have no effect?</p><br/><p>The battle has become a stalemate.</p><br/><p>I try to dissolve him, but his regeneration prevents his death. At the same time, my regenerative ability negates his corrosion.</p><br/><p>Each one attempts to devour the other like the Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>The one who eats the other first, wins.</p><br/><p>Simple, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>I had planned this in order to win.</p><br/><p>Rather than depending on skills I have yet to truly master, I decided to depend on my most fundamental ones.</p><br/><p>The power that I have.</p><br/><p>My slime abilities [Dissolve, Absorb] mix incredibly well with [Predator].</p><br/><p>Thus at the same time as I began absorbing and dissolving this orc, I also activated [Predator].</p><br/><p>I am a predator.</p><br/><p>Orc Disaster, the power that you hold, [Starving Ones], is certainly strong.</p><br/><p>However, you are a scavenger.</p><br/><p>Eating anything and everything is certainly amazing, but it is my skill that specializes in hunting down and devouring prey.</p><br/><p>And while we have both been eating each other, I will devour your ability first.</p><br/><p>Using my ability, unique skill [Predator]!</p><br/><p>My skill can analyze the abilities of living enemies, whereas yours only of the dead.</p><br/><p>This moment has decided the battle.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>How much time had passed?</p><br/><p>As we attempt to eat each other.</p><br/><p>But believing in my victory, I focus on predating him and,</p><br/><p>I cannot lose.</p><br/><p>I have eaten my brethren.</p><br/><p>I cannot lose.</p><br/><p>I must become a demon lord.</p><br/><p>I have eaten Gelmudo-sama.</p><br/><p>I cannot lose.</p><br/><p>My brethren are starving.</p><br/><p>I cannot lose.</p><br/><p>Eating until we have our fill!</p><br/><p>Thoughts poured into me.</p><br/><p>Hmph. Are you an idiot?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re on, but you\u2019ve already lost to me.</p><br/><p>But, I cannot lose\u2026</p><br/><p>I have eaten my brethren.</p><br/><p>I\u2026 am sinful\u2026</p><br/><p>So I will not lose.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s pointless.</p><br/><p>Let me teach you something.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s survival of the fittest in this world. You\u2019ve lost.</p><br/><p>So you die.</p><br/><p>But, I cannot lose\u2026</p><br/><p>If I die, my brethren will be burdened with my sins.</p><br/><p>I became sinful, so that they won\u2019t starve, for that I would do anything!</p><br/><p>I will become the demon lord.</p><br/><p>So that no one starves, I will devour the hunger itself!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right!</p><br/><p>I am Demon Lord Orc Disaster. The devourer of worlds.</p><br/><p>And yet, you\u2019re still going to die.</p><br/><p>But rest easy.</p><br/><p>I will devour your sins.</p><br/><p>What\u2026?|</p><br/><p>You will devour\u2026 my sins?</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>And not just yours, but also those of your kind.</p><br/><p>Mine\u2026 ours\u2026 all our sins\u2026</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you greedy.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>I am greedy.</p><br/><p>Can you relax now?</p><br/><p>Once you have, just go to sleep.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026</p><br/><p>I cannot lose.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>Sleep, huh. I feel\u2026 warm.</p><br/><p>Greedy one.</p><br/><p>You destination is hardly tranquil.</p><br/><p>But, you who have accepted my sins\u2026</p><br/><p>Thank you.</p><br/><p>Now my hunger has finally been fulfilled!</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Orc Disaster. Named Gelmudo.</p><br/><p>Just now, his consciousness has finally disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u226aConfirmed. Demon Lord Orc Disaster has disappeared.</p><br/><p>Unique Skill [Starving Ones] has been absorbed by unique skill [Predator].\u226b</p><br/><p>I have won.</p><br/><p>One who always starves could never have won against me who knows no hunger.</p><br/><p>And, I open my eyes.</p><br/><p>Burdened with the sins of his entire race.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have won. Sleep well, Demon Lord Orc Disaster Gelmudo!\u300d</p><br/><p>My declaration resounded across the land otherwise silent.</p><br/><p>And at that moment, the Goblins and Lizardmen shouted for joy even as the Orcs lamented in despair.</p><br/><p>And thus, the Orc invasion has been stopped.</p><br/><p>Based on his consciousness that had been flowing into me until now, Gelmudo was in fact the cause of this incident.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he was in fact supported by an unknown number of demon lords.</p><br/><p>That, however, the Orc Lord had learned before establishing his self, so was rather unsure about it.</p><br/><p>But I know enough to stay vigilant.</p><br/><p>And beside, I can\u2019t just leave the orcs as they are.</p><br/><p>The main problem has yet to be resolved.</p><br/><p>The following day.</p><br/><p>History will forever remember the birth of the Great Jura Forest Alliance, and the conference where it began.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

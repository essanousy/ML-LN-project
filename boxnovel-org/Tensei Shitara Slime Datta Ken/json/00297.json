And so it was all good as a result.</p><br/><p>Kenya and the others fused with the spirits at the soul level.</p><br/><p>Their bodies grew and got used to that power.</p><br/><p>\u2014Putting aside exceptions like Shizu-san and Kenya and the others.</p><br/><p>I kept on explaining these to them while keeping the concrete stuff hazy.</p><br/><p>Now then, it\u2019s about time.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s change the topic here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you now properly understand that it is extremely difficult to freely handle a spirit\u2019s powers in a human\u2019s body. If so, then acquiring this strength in a human\u2019s body\u2014in other words, being able to use this mysterious power, what must one do to be able to do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked around at everyone listening to me while asking that question.</p><br/><p>Being asked a question suddenly, they were perplexed.</p><br/><p>However, there were those who were fast in catching up too\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way Satoru-sensei phrased that right now\u2014not use the spirit\u2019s strength, but use the mysterious power. In other words, if it\u2019s a high ranking being other than spirits, it might be easier to use even in a human\u2019s body?\u201d</p><br/><p>He came presenting a conjecture coming straight for the core.</p><br/><p>I smiled and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of the prodigy of Ingracia Synthesis Academy. That\u2019s quite some insight you have there, Julius-kun. Or is it that since the royalty of Ingracia kingdom are well acquainted with spirits, it is only natural for you to know? Then, let me ask specifically. What do you think that is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I realized, Julius\u2019 noble-like attitude of looking down on me had disappeared.</p><br/><p>His anger probably disappeared too while he was listening to the explanation.</p><br/><p>It seems that he has acknowledged me as a teacher\u2014no, maybe as something more.</p><br/><p>Julius looked hesitant to answer to my question.</p><br/><p>However, the answer was already in his mind.</p><br/><p>As if he didn\u2019t want to speak of it, he opened his mouth only to close it again. But then he drastically went ahead and said it.</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist .com Website. Stop reading at pirate sites like that steals translations.

Surely there are people here from NNU Magic and Science Investigation Academy who know of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if the NNU students were nervous, they flinched.</p><br/><p>But no one answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cArmored Corps\u2014one of the previous Empire\u2019s 3 biggest army corps. The soldiers who were enlisted there seemed to have undergone black magic remodeling surgery and became super soldiers but\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>After I said that much, the instructors also realized.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack magic remodeling surgery is supposed to be forbidden due to inhumane methods\u2026 Besides, the surviving scientists are\u2014don\u2019t tell me, those scientists are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, even if it\u2019s so, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Even if black magic remodeling surgery can strengthen the body, it would only go as high as A rank at most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Translations by AsianHobbyist Website.</p><br/><p>Heinrich declared.</p><br/><p>As expected of a researcher, he knows more than combat types.</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Certainly, from the information I gathered, there are very few who have gone up to A rank. And that strength wouldn\u2019t come close to a semi-demon lord class. However\u2014what\u2019s important here is, strengthening the body.\u201d</p><br/><p>After I hinted that much, Heinrich also realized.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 see, a demon only wants a strengthened body, eh\u2026 If a demon dwells in a strengthened body, even if it\u2019s a greater demon, they might have the strength to beat a holy knight. And that\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, that\u2019s Demon Fusion.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s about right.</p><br/><p>The strong being of this island, Poison Tiger, who has little combat experience, seemed crude considering it is a semi-demon lord class.</p><br/><p>In contrast, if Magnus, who has a ton of combat experience, were to acquire the strength of a demon\u2026</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be weird even if he acquired strength exceeding that of Poison Tiger.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the chances of black magic remodeling surgery progressing in these past 10 years is quite high.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s probably no mistake in thinking that Irina, the researcher who seemed to be the mastermind behind this, is the leading person behind that research.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s about pretty much it. With this, Magnus\u2019 strength should be easy to comprehend to a certain extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I brought the talk to a finish temporarily.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

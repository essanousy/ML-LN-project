The tables had turned, it was Clayman who was actually being manipulated.</p><br/><p>Clayman became flustered and began to slowly back away.</p><br/><p>\u300cPreposterous...Demon Marionette should have been succeeded completely!</p><br/><p>Why are you not under the control of the Incantation? This can\u2019t be happening!\u300d</p><br/><p>He blurted out bewildered muttering.</p><br/><p>The situation was untenable.</p><br/><p>The cat was already out of the bag. He could no longer make any excuses. There is only one way left for him.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lords already knew Clayman had tried to manipulate Milim. How each Demon Lord would interpret this varied.</p><br/><p>However, the verdict for the perpetrator of such heinous actions had already been decided.</p><br/><p>Although there was a non-aggression pact between the Demon Lords, it didn\u2019t encompass instigating a fight.</p><br/><p>In the end, Clayman had lost his trustworthiness.</p><br/><p>His demise was imminent. How pitiful.</p><br/><p>But, the other Demon Lords did not get a chance to give Clayman a complementary one-way ticket to the deepest recesses of oblivion.</p><br/><p>\u300cYea, It was quite hard acting!</p><br/><p>You know, the magic you used was completely ineffective.</p><br/><p>For the magic to even begin to take effect, I had to lower the multiple barriers that perpetually surround my body.</p><br/><p>Then I needed to forcibly lower my resistances to your magic.</p><br/><p>Then I needed to act perfectly to make you believe I was under your incantation.</p><br/><p>You are cautious, so, I had to make you feel like you had absolute control over me.</p><br/><p> Just like that! I tried my best to fool you, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWh...What the...? It was an act? I\u2026 It was a deliberate act?</p><br/><p>The Demon Marionette should have dominated everyone, even a Demon Lord!</p><br/><p>This is an Ultimate Incantation!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? But, it was impossible to dominate me you know.</p><br/><p>You see, my specialty is to dispel things like this!\u300d</p><br/><p>Milim proudly proclaimed, while puffing out her chest.</p><br/><p>The other females in the room could only glare at her and sigh.</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, I began to worry when Clayman hit Milim before.</p><br/><p>I had no worry in the successfulness of Millm\u2019s plan. However, I was worrying my house would be left in rubble.</p><br/><p>Really, I\u2019m glad you could endure it.\u300d(ED: the definition of scum is literally a picture of Clayturd\u2019s face when you look it up the dictionary)</p><br/><p>The Harpy, Demon Lord Frey, spoke while spreading out her wings.</p><br/><p>Not only hitting her this time, he had also hit her before? (Ed: really scum.)</p><br/><p>What a guy. Does he have a death wish?</p><br/><p>\u300cUmmm\u2026 I\u2019m also an adult. Adults can endure these sorts of things.\u300d</p><br/><p>Although there was an emphasis on her being an adult, she still held the aura of being a child. </p><br/><p>\u300cWhich part? Well, it\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>At any rate, why did you try to fool Clayman?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMmmm..? You know, I remembered that Clayman was making some highly suspicious propositions.</p><br/><p>Like his plan to attack Tempest City with a human army to make humans and monsters go to war.</p><br/><p>Because interesting things would\u2019ve been lost if this were to occur, I decided to put an end to his conspiracy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cReally? You\u2026 just did it by yourself....\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFuwahahahaha! Like I said, I\u2019m an adult!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, yes, You are an adult.</p><br/><p>But, Clayman, You! You arrogant fool.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think you have the qualification to call yourself a Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Even though I didn\u2019t interfere, because Milim had to endure serving under you... I\u2019m also a little angry.\u300d</p><br/><p>Frey said in tranquil fury.</p><br/><p> \u300cSo that\u2019s it\u2026 I also have a lot to say, my town also got vaporized.</p><br/><p>So, Clayman, I\u2019m going to get you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Demon Lord Karion declared, while splendidly dumping Milim\u2019s responsibility on Clayman.</p><br/><p>It seems like Clayman provoked anger from the other Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>However, the most infuriated individual was myself.</p><br/><p>To Milim, who was doing her best for me and the other\u2019s sake, I was really happy.</p><br/><p>She even got hit by that low-life....(ED: scum\u2026 just scum.)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s decided, your chance to die in peace is gone. Prepare to be purged and beg for your death.</p><br/><p>\u300cI ask for your forgiveness. But this guy is my opponent. Because I call myself a Demon Lord, I will prepare my seat by myself.</p><br/><p>I will use this person as a ticket for all of you to recognize my admission for being a Demon Lord.\u300d</p><br/><p>I exclaimed, as if Clayman were just a tool to achieve my goals, so it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 My real intention was to check how strong I am.</p><br/><p>Only Milim smiled happily.</p><br/><p>Even if I didn\u2019t say it, my anger was transmitted to the others.</p><br/><p>Clayman, have you regained your composure while hearing our conversation?</p><br/><p>\u300cKukuku. Is that so? Just like that? It brings tear to my eyes, to spy for your friend\u2019s sake.</p><br/><p>Wahahahahahahaha. This is truly a joyous occasion.</p><br/><p>That feared tyrant Milim, is now a gopher for someone else?</p><br/><p>Why should I be afraid of this person? What a joke.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s fine. Although it is a bit early, allow me to use my trump card!\u300d</p><br/><p>So he said, while taking out a jewel of various colors from his pocket.</p><br/><p>I feel spirit power from that jewel\u2026 that level of energy is equal to around 10,000 human souls....</p><br/><p>\u2726\u2727\u2726\u2727\u2726</p><br/><p>Flash!</p><br/><p>Upon the light beginning to dim, the person who stood there had been transformed into a being that\u2019s very different from before.</p><br/><p>The hair of the being emanated spiritual energy; a trail of dazzling multicolored light was left in its wake. The length of the hair had also greatly increased.</p><br/><p>All The clothes on his upper body were torn in multiple places revealing colossal amounts of muscle lying beneath it.</p><br/><p>His eyes were tinged with a rainbow hue as he glared around the room.</p><br/><p>That being emitted holy power on a level that could rival the Giant Demon Lord Dagruel.</p><br/><p>Clayman forced an artificial Demon Lord evolution using that stone as a catalyst.</p><br/><p>By absorbing energy from the Spirit Jewel; he forcibly awakened himself as a Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>However, because the used energy attribute was different from his own, he evolved into an uncompleted state, a Variant Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>But, because he didn\u2019t need to wait the blessing of the harvest festival to occur, he would be able Utilize his full power immediately.</p><br/><p>(POV change to Clayman)</p><br/><p>The body, that was just undergone evolution, was still weak.</p><br/><p>But my Unique Skill \u300ePuppeteer\u300f, show signs of evolving after receiving the energy; a truly devastating power.</p><br/><p>Indeed, by gaining this power, I no longer feel inferior to that being over there.</p><br/><p>No, I understand.</p><br/><p>I am not a True Demon Lord, after all, this is only an imitation of it.</p><br/><p>This is power!</p><br/><p>This is an awakening!</p><br/><p>And, this is the strength of a Demon Lord!</p><br/><p>In response to the energy ball that I shot as a test, Demon Lord Karion is thrown to the back.</p><br/><p>Frey is the same. To defend against that, it was impossible.</p><br/><p>Just like what I expected, Milim didn\u2019t even flinch. What an annoying brat.</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019s still difficult to win against them even if I was awakened a long time ago.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lords who survived through at least three Great War.</p><br/><p>Apart from that cheeky fairy; Guy, Milim and Dagruel are particularly troublesome.</p><br/><p>I can handle the newcomer Demon Lords but these three people are bad news.</p><br/><p>As usual, I can always calmly judge the situation.</p><br/><p>By blowing away 2 Demon Lords, I can quickly confirm the situation.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s irritating that the slime and his companion in the back are safe, but first, I need to withdraw to reorganize.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s necessary, I\u2019ll crush them one by one.</p><br/><p>I need to report to \u2018That Person\u2019 who gave me this jewel, to consult about the plan for future actions.</p><br/><p>In that case, the plan has been decided.</p><br/><p>By firing Demon Lord Destruction Cannon (Demon Blaster) at maximum output, it\u2019s possible touse it to create an opening for an escape.</p><br/><p>The one who I should be wary of is Guy, but that person didn\u2019t show any interest in this matter.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s possible to escape. That\u2019s the judgment I made.</p><br/><p>While thinking about these things, I released the Demon Blaster.</p><br/><p>It was a destructive power that could eradicate even a Demon Lord. The accumulated energy became a disruption ray, which can cause destruction of one\u2019s magic power array inside the victim\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Physical defense would be useless, even a barrier that utilizes magic power would be destroyed against this ultimate magic attack.</p><br/><p>If concentrated against an individual, someone who can withstand this doesn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>This time, because I fire it for a wide area, there might be some survivor but there is no time for leisure.</p><br/><p>I laughed at the power of the Demon Lord Destruction Cannon (Demon Blaster) I fired which drastically powered up more than I ever imagined by the evolution.</p><br/><p>The Demon Blaster filled the surroundings with light, dyeing the vicinity with rainbow.....\u2726\u2727\u2726\u2727\u2726</p><br/><p>When the flash calms down, Clayman was flustered with a dumbfounded expression on his face, did he finally realized that the jewel in his hand had been stolen?(ED: alt tl:When the flash calms down, Clayman was flustered with a dumbfounded expression on his face, did he finally realized that the jewel that I hold in my hand is the one I stole from him?)</p><br/><p>It seems, I was right in believing the simulated scene displayed by Raphael\u2019s future prediction.</p><br/><p>Using thought transmission to display the scene directly into the mind, it could depictthe scene that\u2019s convincingly real.</p><br/><p>I looked at the Jewel in my hand, and then secretly put it to my pocket. (ED: \u306b\u3057\u307e\u3044\u3080\u3002 Can also meant put it into the bosom or pocket, which I assume by bosom meant he absorbed it to his body)</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not stealing.</p><br/><p>Because Clayman was raising his hand when he invoked the Jewel, I instantly ate his raised hand.</p><br/><p>Surely, I obtained a nice item. This might be very useful for research later.</p><br/><p>If Clayman managed to use this Jewel, then the outcome would be just like what Raphael\u2019s future prediction had shown.</p><br/><p>Short of completely crush him, the other way to break his spirit is by sealing his trump card.</p><br/><p>So there is no way that I stole the jewel because I desired to possess it, but because of other reasoning.</p><br/><p>To begin with, Clayman was underestimating me.</p><br/><p>Thought acceleration can increase perception by 1 million times, it will be as if time have stood still, but at the same time it\u2019s still possible to invoke magic in the mind.</p><br/><p>In other word, even if the magic need a long time to invoke it, I\u2019ll still be able to set multiple spell simultaneously.</p><br/><p>In this state, it was stupid to let the enemy evolve.</p><br/><p>However, if that happens it would probably become a mess........</p><br/><p>The Demon Lords had recovered from the flash bang that I shot beforehand.</p><br/><p>Because I don\u2019t want to show my own card too much, I trick them by using light. However, it seems to me that it might have been seen by several people.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped. The opponent is way too strong. (ED: can be read as \u2018too high leveled\u2019)</p><br/><p>As much as possible I don\u2019t want to reveal my cards in battle, but I can\u2019t prevent it from being predicted by a bit.</p><br/><p>If Wisdom Lord Raphael can do it, then I need to think that the opponent can also do it.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t find a clear solution for this; more or less it can\u2019t be helped, so I call out to Clayman.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, if you want to use your trump card, do it quickly. I\u2019ll wait for you.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me, your plan was to escape using that light just now?\u300d</p><br/><p>I started to corner him.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a bad person. Oh well, I\u2019m not a person but Slime, you had problem with it?</p><br/><p>\u300cWh, What? What just happened.....?\u300d</p><br/><p>Clayman can\u2019t hide his trembling.</p><br/><p>His trump card was stolen instantly, so it seems he couldn\u2019t grasp the current situation.</p><br/><p>So, what you going to do next? You had already been checkmated.</p><br/><p>The future of the person with your level of ability that hostile towards me has been decided.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s really important to ascertain my ability with the opponent ability.</p><br/><p>For me now, I need to thrash this scum while deceiving the eyes of the other Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>Time is limited, so let\u2019s quickly finish this.</p><br/><p>\u300cSay Clayman, Do you know the fate that befall the king of Falmas Kingdom that you incite before?</p><br/><p>Your specialty was collecting information right? Have you receive the report of it from your subordinate?\u300d</p><br/><p>Breaking his spirit.</p><br/><p>Only by that, my victory conditions would be achieved.</p><br/><p>In order to break his spirit, the best way is fear.</p><br/><p>Or rather, my mindset gradually turned into the likes of villain, was it because I\u2019m a monster?</p><br/><p>Was it because I turned to a Demon Lord? .........Well, whichever is fine.</p><br/><p>Clayman turned his eyes to me after hearing my words.</p><br/><p>Apparently, he had not received any report yet.</p><br/><p>King Edomalis of Falmas Kingdom.</p><br/><p>That guy was still alive.</p><br/><p>Before I came here, I had put him back on the throne of Falmas Kingdom.</p><br/><p>His mind was supported with my skill, so he won\u2019t go mad.</p><br/><p>I had prepared a large amount of trial restorative medicine so that he won\u2019t die when he was tortured. </p><br/><p>I inflict the maximum amount of pain but not enough to make him go mad. His arm and leg that was torn off would grow again, and the cycle repeats.</p><br/><p>That torn off arm and leg would be used in Shion\u2019s cooking, and then it would be fed to the king.</p><br/><p>He was then released from being a prisoner after 7 days, this was performed after Shion\u2019s revival.</p><br/><p>He was only released after the resentment of being killed had sufficiently calmed down.</p><br/><p>Now, about the King\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>His spirit had been broken, so if he opposed me I can kill him anytime.</p><br/><p>But, if after all of that he still dared to oppose me, I\u2019ll take my hat off to him. (ED: http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/I+take+my+hat+off+to)</p><br/><p>In any case, until Youmu's rule was established, I don\u2019t have any option except for him to be nothing more than an obedient puppet king.</p><br/><p>Then, if the manipulated king itself tasted hell, doesn\u2019t that mean that the one who manipulated him should receive an even more gruesome suffering?</p><br/><p>\u300cShion, I will stop this guy. So, I\u2019ll lend him to you for a moment after that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFrom a while ago what are you saying!?What about that Human King?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, to send your subordinate as my opponent? You coward, my opponent is ......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnnoying. Shut up worm!\u300d</p><br/><p>By my order, Clayman\u2019s blabbering stopped.</p><br/><p>Although he tried to articulate, the words didn\u2019t come out contrary to Clayman\u2019s intention.</p><br/><p>That was only natural.</p><br/><p>That was because, my new ability, Unique Skill \u300ePuppeteer\u300f, it was impossible for Clayman to utter any word.</p><br/><p>Well, even if don\u2019t know whether or not I can use it, I still stole the ability.</p><br/><p>As expected, Clayman noticed that his ability has been stolen and become frantic.</p><br/><p>However, he can\u2019t produce any voice.</p><br/><p>This is to make him speak the mastermind behind this whole incident, but before that......</p><br/><p>\u300cShion, I will let you hit him, but only for three seconds.\u300d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s just like a starving dog that had been told, \u2018Wait!\u2019 and then she beat Clayman with all of her strength for 3 second.</p><br/><p>Probably, a rain of more than 100 fists poured down and storms Clayman.</p><br/><p>The 3 second beating had finished and Clayman\u2019s super recovery was started to kick in to heal his condition.</p><br/><p>However, was there anyone who capable to imagine the horrors that Clayman subjected to?</p><br/><p>What I gave to Clayman was not something that can be talked over.</p><br/><p>I prevent him from going mad by strengthening his spirit while at the same time I accelerate his perception and sensory by 1 million times using thought acceleration skill.</p><br/><p>My ability is not only limited to me, by bestowing it to another person, it was possible for them to be influenced by it.</p><br/><p>Under the influence of Wisdom Lord Raphael, Clayman\u2019s perception of time has been stretched for him, so he will be assailed by fear and agony of being pummeled for several 10 days.(TL: To imagine it, please think it as Rimuru\u2019s version of Mangekyou Sharingan)</p><br/><p>Knowing Shion and this scum, my intention was to instantly put \u300eTerror\u300f by cladding him with punches.</p><br/><p>This was, not only the body, but also inflicts damage to his spirit.</p><br/><p>By preventing Clayman\u2019s mind from going crazy then the pain, the agony and the terror would be accumulated but without any means to escape.</p><br/><p>So, with those feelings that had nowhere to go, fear shall be engraved upon his soul.</p><br/><p>When three seconds had passed, Clayman\u2019s hair turned into pure white, his appearance was just like a corpse.</p><br/><p>His body was an Undead, if it was not about destroying his mind (spirit) then it will be useless.</p><br/><p>Already, his condition was not able to raise any defiance against me.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, Clayman. If you obediently talk, I will kill you. If you don\u2019t talk, I will let you play with Shion once more.\u300d</p><br/><p>Did he understand my word?</p><br/><p>\u300cTalk, I\u2019ll talk! I\u2019ll say everything, Please forgive me. Ple, please kill me!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>His voice became stiff.</p><br/><p>Did I succeeded in breaking his mind?</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I will ask. What\u2019s the name of the mastermind that\u2019s pulling the string?\u300d</p><br/><p>Looking at me for awhile with his dull eyes, he began to show hesitation...</p><br/><p>When I stare back with a bloodshot eyes,</p><br/><p>\u300cSay! I\u2019ll say it, please wait!\u300d(ED: In case someone wondering, the previous one is , while this line is .)</p><br/><p>He starts to raise his voice in panic.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cMy master, that person\u2019s name, Kazaream. \u201cSorcery King (Curse Lord)\u201d Kazaream.</p><br/><p>Though he was slain by Leon there, to revive his spiritual body, there is a need to gather power.</p><br/><p>Also, I can become a Demon Lord because of that person\u2019s greatness.......\u300d</p><br/><p>Fumu.</p><br/><p>Who is that?</p><br/><p>What about the reaction of the other Demon Lords? There was only a slight of it.</p><br/><p>Leon become Demon Lord was a story from 200 years ago, It seems he turned Clayman into a demon lord, furthermore, he also tried to increase the number of his comrades, is that it?</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! I remember.</p><br/><p>If you become my comrade then I will turn you into Demon Lord! And other self-important talk.</p><br/><p>He was noisy, so I killed him immediately..... Why would I want a comrade like that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Leon muttered nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>Leon... What a frightening child. The guy who wouldn\u2019t want to hear the other person\u2019s words is here.</p><br/><p>Oh well, it then become all clear. Since the older days, augmenting their own power and influence was a solid precept.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, what is the purpose? What did you planned by attacking Tempest?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe purpose is, to transform me into a Demon Lord. Spirit jewel is the trump card, but after the effective time has passed, the power will disappear.</p><br/><p>So, it\u2019s only for helping me turn into Demon Lord.\u300d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>By generating strife, a large quantity of \u2018Death\u2019 will spread. As a result, It will prompt his awakening, huh?</p><br/><p>But, that bastard Kazaream, I still don\u2019t know much about his character.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to revive his Spiritual Body, is it by using possession?</p><br/><p>If he was in the domain of the Demon Lords, his existence will be immediately found out. But there is no one who noticed his presence, then it could be said that he was not hiding in the Demon Lord\u2019s Domain.</p><br/><p>Did he take form as a human? Or, possibly, did he possess a human?</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, since when did you serve under him?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat was.......</p><br/><p>I receive the title of Demon Lord about 400 years ago, but before that I was Kazaream-sama\u2019s aide.</p><br/><p>Even after becoming a Demon Lord, I still moved following That Person instruction.</p><br/><p>After defeated by Leon, I hadn\u2019t received any words from him for about 100 years, but several decades ago he abruptly contacted me.</p><br/><p>Since then, I have moved according to \u201cThat Person\u201d will.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat person, did he had any subordinates now?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo.... His subordinates are few. Including me, there were only several others. But his information gathering ability is frightening.</p><br/><p>The trend in human cities is from that person. While information about Demon Lords, comes from me.</p><br/><p>Even the information about the Eastern Power, it can be said that he had grasped all intelligence of the world.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. I Understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>Several decades ago, huh?</p><br/><p>It feels like something is connected.</p><br/><p>What I had thought, and with the real fact.</p><br/><p>From there, by using Wisdom Lord Raphael calculation, we can derive an estimation.</p><br/><p>The conclusion was still pending. However, estimation seems uncertain.</p><br/><p>But it means that this case = closed...... The mastermind\u2019s purpose, is it really only to turn Clayman into True Demon Lord?</p><br/><p>Whatever.</p><br/><p>I had heard everything that I wanted to hear. The next thing to do, let\u2019s do it softly...... (ED: I think the last part can also be translated as \u201cLet\u2019s put him at ease\u201d) </p><br/><p>\u300cI will tell you only once. You won\u2019t be able to revive, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>So, I told Clayman.</p><br/><p>If he can revive then it\u2019s not good.</p><br/><p>For a moment it seems that Clayman still don\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>However, his face immediately turned pale.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? What are you talking about?\u300d</p><br/><p>He tried to dodge the question desperately.</p><br/><p>I had no doubt that this person has been speaking honestly, but that\u2019s also a part of his plan.</p><br/><p>After I grant death to him, he will detach his astral body and then planned to revive himself.</p><br/><p>But too bad, Wisdom Lord Raphael had predicted that move.</p><br/><p>To be frank, in front of me such trick will be all revealed.</p><br/><p>Clayman judged that he can\u2019t win against me, so he chose to avoid tasting the agony.</p><br/><p>Because he talked too honestly, I had some doubt on it.</p><br/><p>The things he talked about was a fact.</p><br/><p>However, he had prepared himself to revive after he died, he doesn\u2019t want to taste agony anymore.</p><br/><p>This guy really is underhanded.</p><br/><p>But in a sense, his persistency to go and report to his master is worthy of praise.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, because we already heard what want to be heard, what\u2019s left is Clayman\u2019s execution.</p><br/><p>Are there any objection? If there are, then you are also my opponent.\u300d</p><br/><p>I ignored the clamoring Clayman, and observed the response from the other Demon Lords.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo as you like.\u300d</p><br/><p>The Red hair, Guy replied as the representative.</p><br/><p>There seems to be no objection.</p><br/><p>\u300cStop! Oi, Stop!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Noisy Clayman.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs I promised, I will grant you a quick death.

Dino could not wait to get this all over with.</p><br/><p>However, his opponent would now allow it to be so easy.</p><br/><p>He had thought that he\u2019d lightly evaded Beretta\u2019s unleashed fist, but the swinging arm ignored any notion of structure and rammed into him.</p><br/><p>It had twisted around like a snake, transforming freely.</p><br/><p>(He looked like a human, but was ignoring the rest!</p><br/><p>Besides, wasn\u2019t he supposed to have the body of a doll. He has completely assimilated with it.)</p><br/><p>In just one moment of offensive and defensive battle, Dino had seen through what made Beretta dangerous.</p><br/><p>He was almost a different person from when he had fought him before. He had beaten him easily that time, but things were clearly not going to be the same now.</p><br/><p>(But really, this was too much growth for such a short amount of time\u2026)</p><br/><p>Not only Gabil and Gerudo but now even Beretta.</p><br/><p>On top of all this, Zegion was still waiting nearby. The situation was now bad enough for Dino to want to give up.</p><br/><p>It was probably because he was leisurely analyzing such things that he did not immediately notice that the ground beneath his feet was turning into a swamp.</p><br/><p>Oh, damn! He thought, but it was already too late. Dino\u2019s feet had been sucked into the ground.</p><br/><p>This was due to an earth element attack from Beretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. You didn\u2019t have such abilities before, did you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right? Well, I do now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now the ground was up to his knees as he continued to sink, but that was not even the end of it.</p><br/><p>The ground started to solidify, it had changed into a liquid metal.</p><br/><p>It had become fetters that would be difficult to escape with strength alone. Dino was captured.</p><br/><p>As Dino had only been cautious of Zegion, this growth from Beretta was completely unexpected.</p><br/><p>He had planned to disable Beretta first and then take on Zegion, but it was clear that the situation would no longer allow it.</p><br/><p>As he was thinking this, Zegion attacked.</p><br/><p>The fists that shot out were as fast and sharp as ever.</p><br/><p>Dino could not move his legs and had no way to dodge the attacks, he attempted a parry with his left arm.</p><br/><p>Piercing.</p><br/><p>It was a surprisingly light blow.</p><br/><p>No, too light.</p><br/><p>It was not a blow, but there was a pain that reached to the depths of his soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch\u2026..!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino screamed at the intense pain.</p><br/><p>He was a spiritual life form, which meant that he, of course, had \u2018Pain Immunity.\u2019</p><br/><p>But even then, Dino\u2019s soul was howling out in pain as if to mock him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo-, you! You\u2019re not Zegion!? You tricked me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you fool. It is your own fault for allowing yourself to be tricked.</p><br/><p>Did you think that there was any merit in using normal attacks on someone who has raised their anti-damage resistance?</p><br/><p>However, since you stayed cautious of Zegion\u2019s attacks, it made it much easier for my own to get through.</p><br/><p>Unexpected attacks tend to pack quite a punch, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zegion, no\u2026 Apito, who had turned into Zegion through the use of his powers, answered with a laugh.</p><br/><p>And with that, she transformed into a beautiful insect model devil.</p><br/><p>It was very unlikely that the \u2018Instant Death Effect\u2019 would work, but the \u2018Severe Pain Effect\u2019 which was one rank lower, seemed to be potent.</p><br/><p>Had he been able to forsee the attack and resist it, then he may have been able to curb the effect. But now that it had hit him once, the second time would be impossible to resist.</p><br/><p>This was all due to Apito\u2019s ability, Anaphylaxis Shock.</p><br/><p>Now that Dino had been hit by it once, it was as if he had been robbed completely of his ability to resist it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s dirty! It was cowardly enough for you to attack as a pair, but now you would even do something so low as this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilence!! There is no such thing as fair play in warfare. You just need to win, if you lose then you die! That is the ironclad rule.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apito roared back as Dino shouted.</p><br/><p>Her belief that victory meant everything did not allow Dino much room to protest.</p><br/><p>Even Beretta seemed to be a little put off by Apito\u2019s extreme logic.</p><br/><p>Arnaud and the others that weren\u2019t present would have probably brushed it off and said, \u2018think of it as a kindness that she at least put it into words.\u2019 But for those who were not used to being around Apito, this came as somewhat of a shock.</p><br/><p>Generally, Apito was very quiet in front of Zegion.</p><br/><p>But now that she was here to represent Zegion, she seemed to be very excited. There was really no one who could stop her now.</p><br/><p>A sadistic smile cracked on her face as she raised her beautiful hand towards Dino.</p><br/><p>\u201cWai-, let\u2019s wait a moment!</p><br/><p>Okay? Let\u2019s calm down and talk?</p><br/><p>You\u2019ll understand if we talk! I think people can come to understand each other!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that may be true. Now, die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino\u2019s suggestion was mixed with screaming; Apito gave him a benevolent smile.</p><br/><p>And while wearing that smile, she stabbed once.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch!!! Wai-, I\u2019m serious, just wait! This hurts! This really hurts you know!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino screamed through tear-filled eyes.</p><br/><p>He wanted to run, but his feet were firmly imprisoned, it was impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHooo ho ho ho! Not so cocky now, Dino?</p><br/><p>What should I do? If you cry and say that you are sorry, I may just forgive you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino was screaming from the severe pain as Ramiris addressed him through her own laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you telling me, that I must betray Velda!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Wasn\u2019t that rather quick for you? That is exactly right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? How could I ever do that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. Can\u2019t you? Why not? I have a question for you, Dino. Why do you serve him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, why\u2026 Well, it\u2019s because one can\u2019t go against Veldanava, can one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDino, think carefully about it. Veldanava and Velda are different, did you not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Of course, that\u2019s common knowledge\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(Hmm? Common knowledge? No, wait\u2026 Velda is Veldanava, right?)</p><br/><p>Dino felt a sense of unease with this conversation with Ramiris.</p><br/><p>He felt a contradiction in his words, he had to stop and think.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, never mind. In any case, since you did betray such a pure heart as mine, I must make you regret your actions for a while!</p><br/><p>Now, finish him off! Beretta and Apito!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dino\u2019s screams echoed.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, Dino was not given any time to think slowly. He would be forced to suffer through Apito\u2019s successive attacks.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Ramiris\u2019 delighted laughter echoed in the control room.</p><br/><p>Apparently torturing Dino had given her a great sense of relief.</p><br/><p>She was now staring at the large screen and wearing an incredibly satisfied look on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, perhaps I\u2019ll forgive him right about now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going a little too far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. Dino is a lot tougher than you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Benimaru sighed as he asked the question, but Ramiris just brushed it aside.</p><br/><p>One of her main objectives had been to get revenge on Dino, so this was one thing that she would not back down on.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, I do wonder. This guy named Zero, do you think that he will really move like Rimuru said he would?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJudging by the way Velda had cut down Kazaream? I don\u2019t doubt it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, then Velda isn\u2019t Veldanava after all.</p><br/><p>Dino wasn\u2019t aware of this either.</p><br/><p>Can you believe that he thinks he is cunning and can\u2019t be fooled by anyone?</p><br/><p>What an idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, uhh\u2026 Well, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Benimaru realized there was a bit of himself in Ramiris\u2019 words. He nodded back to her with a little regret.</p><br/><p>He would try to shift the conversation to something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, Zegion never ceases to impress me. It was almost too easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Had they seriously wanted to ambush them, they could have sent Zegion and the other labyrinth guards to press an attack without giving Zero a chance to encroach on the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the control room had thought this.</p><br/><p>And the reason that they had opted for a much more elaborate scheme instead, was because Rimuru had ordered it.</p><br/><p>The current strategy was something that Benimaru and Ramiris had talked about and decided together, after hearing Rimuru\u2019s predictions of Velda\u2019s battle strategy for invading the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Zero encroached on the labyrinth and usurped its authority, just like Rimuru had predicted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It is unthinkable that Rimuru\u2019s predictions could be wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuna nodded proudly at Ramiris\u2019 mutterings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe next prediction is about what move Zero will take.</p><br/><p>After assimilating with the labyrinth, it should be quite difficult to maintain his sense of self, don\u2019t you think? Something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He isolated over half of the divisions of my labyrinth. Who knows what will happen if he absorbs all of that!</p><br/><p>To be honest, it\u2019s one thing to slowly soak it in and encroach, but assimilating all at once will most likely make one lose their mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. And what did Lord Rimuru have to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, he said that Zero would surely encroach on the labyrinth. So Rimuru wants us to isolate parts of the labyrinth to make the bait easier to see.</p><br/><p>When this happens, he wasn\u2019t sure if Zero would be able to stay sane, but he believes it will have some effect on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so we had Zegion attack as soon as the labyrinth had been isolated.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a matter of there being an effect or not. We would ensure that there was an effect.</p><br/><p>Lord Rimuru was a little worried about having Zero and Zegion face each other, but Zegion seemed quite enthusiastic about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. Though Zegion ended up having an easier time with it than we had expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I understand all of that. And so, what did Lord Rimuru say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris and Benimaru both helped to answer Shuna\u2019s question, but they seemed reluctant to explain the most important part.</p><br/><p>Perhaps she had felt annoyed by this because Shuna asked them again in a harsher tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He said, \u2018maybe we will be able to see his true nature.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Not so much Zero\u2019s true nature, but Velda\u2019s, I think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris and Benimaru answered.</p><br/><p>In other words, once Zero had assimilated with the labyrinth, he would gain absolute superiority over any enemies that were inside.</p><br/><p>And if this happened, was it not likely that he would not differentiate from friend or foe and launch attacks at them all? That was Rimuru\u2019s prediction.</p><br/><p>On top of that, with Benimaru\u2019s strategy, Zegion had planted a sense of fear in Zero\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Zero would surely want power in order to defeat Zegion then.</p><br/><p>The general outline of the plan Benimaru made was based on the assumption that it would prey on anything it saw, regardless of it being friend or foe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we made sure to have everyone retreat before Zero\u2019s assimilation with the labyrinth reached one hundred percent. A Zero who was so consumed by fear and a thirst for power would attack Dino and the others without a doubt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019 it! By the way, he just passed ninety-eight percent, so it should be any moment now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. Lord Rimuru was right, as expected. But then, what will happen if Zero is able to keep his sense of reasoning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that happens, we will just toss the entire isolated labyrinth into the \u2018Infinite Loop\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the control room found this answer very satisfying.</p><br/><p>The only thing that could make this whole situation even better would be for Dino to be persuaded before Zero\u2019s encroachment was completed.</p><br/><p>But even then\u2026 Shuna noticed something. It didn\u2019t seem like there was enough reason for Rimuru to have dismissed the initial plan to attack.</p><br/><p>In the first place, if you could rid the place of invaders through an assault, then there was no reason to have Zero attack Dino.</p><br/><p>(In that case, what was Lord Rimuru\u2019s true purpose?)</p><br/><p>She looked at the excited Ramiris and came to a certain conclusion.</p><br/><p>(I see\u2026 He doesn\u2019t want to have Dino killed\u2026)</p><br/><p>Rimuru and Dino had joked around and been friendly.</p><br/><p>And Ramiris.</p><br/><p>They had last separated as enemies, but perhaps Rimuru had still not wanted to kill Dino.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if it was because Ramiris had asked him, or if it was his own will, but Shuna was convinced that the truth was along those lines.</p><br/><p>Well, it would explain Ramiris\u2019 attitude quite a lot. She could now understand why they had gone out of their way for this more elaborate plan.</p><br/><p>And so there was nothing left now, but to wait for the result.</p><br/><p>What would Dino do? What would Zero?</p><br/><p>(Regardless of which direction things fell, everything would be in the palm of Lord Rimuru\u2019s hand.)</p><br/><p>Shuna nodded with satisfaction and moved her gaze back to the large screen.</p><br/><p>In actuality, Rimuru had not been thinking so deeply when giving out the orders.</p><br/><p>The only thing he had really ordered was to be wary of an encroachment of the labyrinth, which he had been able to predict through the finished \u2018Aji Dahaka\u2019 ability.</p><br/><p>Also, he told them of his prediction for Zero\u2019s movements and ordered them to reduce any casualties. That was all.</p><br/><p>It was completely beyond any expectations of Rimuru, that Zegion would push Zero so far.</p><br/><p>And one more thing.</p><br/><p>Just like Shuna had noticed, it regarded the treatment of Dino.</p><br/><p>For this, he had not said anything to Benimaru and consulted with Ramiris alone.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, he had decided to leave everything to her.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Ramiris and Benimaru finished their explanations at about the same time that Zero was finishing his rapid assimilation with the labyrinth, after being driven by Zero.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe assimilation rate is at ninety-nine percent! We should call everyone back right about now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ramiris began shouting, Benimaru barked orders.</p><br/><p>The attack unit, which had been given an explanation in advance, returned through teleportation after receiving the order.</p><br/><p>Given that there was a high possibility that a completely assimilated Zero could prevent them from teleporting out, there had been a need for them to be able to ascertain the exact moment they should leave.</p><br/><p>And their plan had succeeded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have just now returned. Lady Ramiris.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beretta addressed her as a representative of those who had returned.</p><br/><p>Everything had gone according to schedule.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, well done!</p><br/><p>Depending on how the enemy reacts, we plan to release the labyrinth into the \u2018Infinite Loop.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, in the event that we fail to accomplish this, we will have to enter an all-out war.</p><br/><p>I think that it goes without saying, that it will be incredibly dangerous to lure an enemy who has assimilated with an isolated space.</p><br/><p>In the event that we are forced to attack once again, all of you must be prepared and standing by!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone understood and agreed with Benimaru\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>How would Zero react? What would Dino do in turn?</p><br/><p>There was a need for them to be sure.</p><br/><p>After all, depending on the results, there was a high likelihood an intense battle would erupt.</p><br/><p>It was quite clear that there was not one person in the room who took the situation lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, it should be obvious without my having to say it, but in regards to Lord Rimuru being alive, that should remain strictly confidential.\u201d</p><br/><p>So saying, Benimaru finished his speech.</p><br/><p>It was to be expected, but they could in no way count on Rimuru to help them, and he had no intention of asking.</p><br/><p>He had accepted the order to defend the labyrinth as a supreme directive, and he would put his heart and soul into fulfilling it.</p><br/><p>This feeling was something shared by everyone who was gathered there.</p><br/><p>Just like Rimuru was searching for any movements by Velda, Velda was also probing for Rimuru.</p><br/><p>This was Rimuru\u2019s own decision and the reason that he did not return to the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Ciel had pointed out the possibility that they would wait for the moment when Rimuru would step foot in the labyrinth, and then isolate the entirety of it.</p><br/><p>It would surely be possible with Velda\u2019s abilities, she had said.</p><br/><p>Ramiris\u2019 \u2018Labyrinth Creation\u2019 was an ability with a high degree of freedom, but it required a connection to this world.</p><br/><p>If that was severed, the labyrinth itself would drift off between the cracks of the dimensions.</p><br/><p>Ciel had been convinced that there was no reason to believe that Velda could not do this if it was possible for Rimuru to.</p><br/><p>And if it did to come to that, while it would be possible to escape, it would take a tremendous amount of time.</p><br/><p>Returning after the world had been destroyed meant that you had still been defeated.</p><br/><p>That was what Rimuru had said when explaining to Benimaru and the others.</p><br/><p>Benimaru remembered those words now and nodded deeply.</p><br/><p>(Don\u2019t worry, Lord Rimuru. I will protect the labyrinth with my life!)</p><br/><p>Determined, Benimaru moved his gaze back to the large screen.</p><br/><p>And so did Ramiris.</p><br/><p>(Dino, that idiot. Really, what was he doing at such a critical moment\u2026)</p><br/><p>The plan was already in its final stage.</p><br/><p>Dino and the others had become a target in the trap to lure Zero out.</p><br/><p>There is a possibility that that Zero will maintain his sanity and cooperate with Dino and the others.</p><br/><p>There was also the possibility that Dino and the others would accept their fate and choose to become food for Zero.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>The result that Ramiris desired, was nothing so boring as those possibilities.</p><br/><p>(Let\u2019s act like fools together again, experiment again. Okay? Dino\u2026)</p><br/><p>That was Ramiris\u2019 wish.</p><br/><p>She believed in the plan that Rimuru had devised.</p><br/><p>She wished as if praying, that Dino would once again become their companion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

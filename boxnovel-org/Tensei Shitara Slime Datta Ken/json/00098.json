I am pretty sure I\u2019ve explicitly stated that I will release chapters on 2 day intervals now. So if a chapter was released on Tuesday, then the next one will be released on Thursday.</p><br/><p>Frankly, I don\u2019t have any left over time. My schedule is planned basically minute-by-minute. So I apologize for the delay, but that is hardly something I have control over.</p><br/><p>Founding Demon Capital Arc</p><br/><p>098. Letter of Invitation</p><br/><p>Templars, defeated!</p><br/><p>Every country bordering the Jura Forest soon heard these news.</p><br/><p>It was preposterous to think that they could have secretly invaded without being seen.</p><br/><p>Moreover, countries that had relations with Tempest could hardly believe that their intelligence gathering teams were negligent.</p><br/><p>Of course, Rimuru was aware that these countries were sending spies.</p><br/><p>Which is why he had ordered a victory that produced the fewest casualties.</p><br/><p>And country executives realized this fact.</p><br/><p>After all, the fact that none of the knights were killed only proved their hypotheses.</p><br/><p>For example, in the Dwarf Kingdom\u2013military nation Dwargon.</p><br/><p>The ministers gathered upon the Dwarf King\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>They were analyzing a recorded image, while scrutinizing every bit of data they could acquire. With every minister having access to the said information.</p><br/><p>The data they had acquired disclosed the matters of the battle.</p><br/><p>The results were rather surprising.</p><br/><p>One hundred Knights Templar, believed to be the strongest among humans, planned an invasion of the country.</p><br/><p>However, Demon Lord Rimuru had intercepted this plan, and his response left the knights completely defeated.</p><br/><p>How truly terrifying the Demon Lord Rimuru\u2019s information gathering skills are!</p><br/><p>Certainly no less terrifying than his ability to strategize!</p><br/><p>So murmured the Ministers.</p><br/><p>However, was it as they said? The Dwarf King looked over the data, and his sight fell upon a bizarre pattern of movements displayed by the combatants.</p><br/><p>Was this not supposed to devolve into a haphazard encounter between the forces?</p><br/><p>Such a thought came to his mind. Actually, that\u2019s the only possibility he could have imagined.</p><br/><p>No matter how much anyone claimed that the altered terrain caused the knights to dance in the palm of Rimuru\u2019s hand, it should have had no bearing on the actual combat.</p><br/><p>If so, he was actually constantly staying aware of Hinata\u2019s plans while modifying the strategy to sway the battle in his favor.</p><br/><p>And as a result, by controlling every aspect of the battle, the knights were completely defeated.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, since the recording magic is rather limited, the dwarfs could only lament the lack of a comprehensive report.</p><br/><p>That is, it could only produce a soundless spectacle of the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Nor could it analyze the skills used; at most, it helped identify the winner.</p><br/><p>Even so, the data they gathered is certainly of grave importance.</p><br/><p>Thus he scrutinized it again.</p><br/><p>Captain-class knights were seen moving in various directions with some plan in mind. The Tempest department heads intercepted resulting in combat.</p><br/><p>The result was a total war across all fronts and a complete victory for Tempest.</p><br/><p>Among these battles, it was noted that a single monster could overwhelm eight knights\u2013much to the dwarfs\u2019 surprise.</p><br/><p>Considering that these knights were at least of captain class, it is best to assume that Monster Country Tempest easily surpasses the military might of Dwargon.</p><br/><p>The ministers noisily grumbled about this, while King Gazelle Dwargo sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>He was truly glad that Demon Lord Rimuru was an idealistic monster who sought friendship with the humans.</p><br/><p>Had he been a monster who sought to destroy humanity, humans would have faced an unprecedented calamity.</p><br/><p>(Besides, he\u2019s growing too fast!)</p><br/><p>Was Gazelle\u2019s true thoughts.</p><br/><p>He had thought Rimuru to be full of potential when they had first met, but he had never considered that he could progress this far.</p><br/><p>Should he have destroyed him then? He could not come up with an answer.</p><br/><p>For better or worse, this demon lord was interesting.</p><br/><p>And, they currently have a cooperation pact and will be proceeding on friendly terms in the future.</p><br/><p>Moreover, thanks to his \u201cWorld Traveler\u201d ideals, he has been developing some interesting contraptions.</p><br/><p>Sparing no time nor effort, and aligning himself with no other \u201cWorld Traveler\u201d, perhaps such is the true strength of this demon lord.</p><br/><p>His movements have thus produced some interesting results.</p><br/><p>And the many skills and technologies developed thus the dwarfs are able to obtain without lifting a finger.</p><br/><p>So Gazelle decided.</p><br/><p>Even if the angels destroy him, the dwarfs will not allow the technology to be lost.</p><br/><p>Of course, they will probably become more and more militaristic in the future\u2026 but Oh well!</p><br/><p>How much joy the dwarfs felt from all the inventions that came from that country.</p><br/><p>(At this point, we have no choice but to trust Demon Lord Rimuru!)</p><br/><p>Besides, he had released all the knights unharmed this time.</p><br/><p>This could be interpreted as seeking to coexist with the humans.</p><br/><p>Had he intended to fight them, he could have massacred the knights. After all, who can complain that an invading force was destroyed?</p><br/><p>And yet he had let them live. Completely unharmed.</p><br/><p>This could also be interpreted to mean that he had the confidence that Knight Templar class soldiers are of no threat to him.</p><br/><p>This is causing quite a division among the ministers: some calling him a danger, others rejecting that notion.</p><br/><p>Both are probably correct.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s only one decision.</p><br/><p>Gazelle cleared his throat and thus got everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>The conference room was completely silent, with every gaze focused on the king.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat demon lord seeks to coexist with humans, so, as much as possible, we will support him. That is the official position of military nation Dwargon!\u300d</p><br/><p>The dwarf king\u2019s declaration reverberated through the hall.</p><br/><p>The ministers bowed their heads and accepted their lord\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>Thus the policy was decided. The specific measures would now be drafted by excellent individuals.</p><br/><p>Whether this was a right or wrong decision, he could not have known.</p><br/><p>But, the Dwarf King had no regrets.</p><br/><p>And then another report was brought to the king.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour Majesty, Rigurdo-dono has sent an announcement.</p><br/><p>It seems that they are planning on holding an event to make known the ascension of a new demon lord and seek our presence.</p><br/><p>Well, this might be a political farce, however. They are simply trying to appeal to countries they are friendly with.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t seem like they actually expect our presence, so how should we respond?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, about that! Bester also mentioned something!</p><br/><p>Tempest, it seems, is planning on holding a tournament\u2026</p><br/><p>Probably a show to go along with the announcement.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat will we do? If we plan to attend, they have requested that we notify them in advance.</p><br/><p>Speaking of,</p><br/><p>There is limited number of seats, and the city is bound to be crowded that day, so they have asked to promptly answer them.\u300d</p><br/><p>Bester\u2019s question was brought up along with this report.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf King pondered for a second.</p><br/><p>(Actually, what the hell is that stupid demon lord planning hosting a tournament now of all time\u2026)</p><br/><p>Completely unpredictable.</p><br/><p>Hence amusing.</p><br/><p>The Dwarf King struggled to keep a smile from surfacing.</p><br/><p>He could not break his facade before the ministers.</p><br/><p>(You bastard\u2026 making me suffer so\u2026 I like it!)</p><br/><p>Stifling the joy with a hint of anger, he announced his decision.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe will attend the ceremony and the tournament\u300d</p><br/><p>He said.</p><br/><p>The Ministers had not at all expected such a response, but this was the decision of their king.</p><br/><p>With the meeting decided, they quickly started to prepare for the journey.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>Sorcerer Dynasty Sarion, the Emperor\u2019s Castle.</p><br/><p>A beautiful garden full of rare life spread behind it.</p><br/><p>Keeping up the garden provided numerous benefits for the dynasty to say nothing of income made from it.</p><br/><p>In other words, it was the source of the dynasty\u2019s pocket money.</p><br/><p>The entire garden was maintained without a penny from the taxes.</p><br/><p>Two beings relaxed inside this garden.</p><br/><p>One was Duke Elalude.</p><br/><p>Father of Adventurer Ellen, and one of the three leaders of this country.</p><br/><p>And a being who was sitting across from him.</p><br/><p>This being is the only one with a higher standing than Duke Elalude in the entire kingdom.</p><br/><p>Empress Elumeshia Elure Sarion herself.</p><br/><p>With a beautiful feminine face\u2013well, she is a woman, after all\u2013she has elf blood flowing through her veins and thus doesn\u2019t age.</p><br/><p>Asking the empress how old she is, is considered a taboo.</p><br/><p>She has the body of a girl who has just reached adulthood. With skin as white as fresh snow.</p><br/><p>Long pointed ears easily distinguish her from anyone else. The glance of her slanted, jade eyes pierce into the very soul of the person before her.</p><br/><p>And, long pale blue silver hair falls gently over her cheeks.</p><br/><p>Duke Elalude was once entranced by the beauty she embodied, but was able to regain his mind after considering his wife\u2019s and daughter\u2019s wrath.</p><br/><p>And with a short prayer, he faced the Empress.</p><br/><p>The one so gracefully sitting upon the cushion across from him,</p><br/><p>\u300cYour Majesty, regarding the monster country I have reported on previously, we have received an announcement.\u300d</p><br/><p>He said and taking out a letter from his breast pocket handed it to the Empress.</p><br/><p>He checked that it was safe. As for its contents, he would rather not say them himself.</p><br/><p>He knew all to well that the Empress hated to have people learn things before her.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>(Having become a demon lord is great and all, but why announce it?)</p><br/><p>And here is the question.</p><br/><p>The letter was addressed to Duke Elalude. Normally, there was no need to let the Empress know about it.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 it read \u201cPlease let us know how many people will participate!\u201d</p><br/><p>And that means that any number of guests are invited.</p><br/><p>So if he doesn\u2019t let the Empress know and goes by himself, she\u2019ll just get mad at him again. And he would rather that not happen.</p><br/><p>After all\u2026</p><br/><p>When he left on a mission to free his daughter from the clutches of an evil demon lord, he received a stern scolding.</p><br/><p>Here\u2019s what she said.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard, how dare you leave your lord\u2019s side! I can\u2019t believe that such an interesting slime exists until I see it personally. Moreover, to witness a birth of a demon lord, which even I have never seen? I\u2019m so jeal\u2026 Ummm, it\u2019s ridiculous! To have missed such a wonderf\u2026 I mean, you don\u2019t even know the danger you were facing! What a fool!\u300d</p><br/><p>And she became depressed.</p><br/><p>Oh, and only Elalude ever saw Empress act like this.</p><br/><p>She appears as a cold hearted individual to the other ministers, and is even feared as the Doll Empress.</p><br/><p>Like a sheep in wolf\u2019s clothing! Elalude always wants to retort.</p><br/><p>So he perfectly understood how angry she would have been had he gone off by himself this time.</p><br/><p>Moreover.</p><br/><p>They even claimed to conduct a Tournament at this occasion.</p><br/><p>If he left her behind, her anger would be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Currently, due to her sulking, he has yet to establish technological cooperation with that country.</p><br/><p>So if her mood improves, maybe they\u2019ll finally be able to finalize those details.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s another important point.</p><br/><p>He had confirmed that Tempest had fought against the Templars recently.</p><br/><p>He had worried about how they will fare against them, but, surprisingly, they didn\u2019t just completely defeat them all, they also released every knight.</p><br/><p>Basically claiming to have overwhelming confidence in themselves.</p><br/><p>They could perhaps be countries that try to appear weak with only the leaders aware of the true strength.</p><br/><p>But even so, to hold a tournament now of all times can only be interpreted as an event to flaunt their strength.</p><br/><p>Well, since this allows Sarion to measure their strength, it is crucial that they participate.</p><br/><p>But to bring the Empress to such an event would create a myriad problems\u2026</p><br/><p>And he was certain that he himself would have to solve all of them.</p><br/><p>Empress Elumeshia returned the letter.</p><br/><p>Elalude gulped in anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour Majesty, how shall we respond?\u300d</p><br/><p>He hesitantly asked.</p><br/><p>With a wide smile on her face,</p><br/><p>\u300cHow indeed\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>She was just putting on airs.</p><br/><p>He could easily predict her next words but still waited for them.</p><br/><p>And hearing an expected response, Duke Elalude would spend the next days without any sleep, busy with preparations.</p><br/><p>\uff0a \uff0a \uff0a</p><br/><p>In the small country Brumund\u2019s trading house, Myormiles was getting tired of the person talking to him.</p><br/><p>As a merchant, he could tell a person\u2019s personality with a single glance.</p><br/><p>Those coming for money, those coming with a new business opportunity.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also fallen nobles who come proposing dubious deals.</p><br/><p>Among all these fools there maybe someone with a legitimate proposal.</p><br/><p>So he can\u2019t leave this job to anyone else.</p><br/><p>While thinking this, he dismissed the swindler before him and called forth the new guest.</p><br/><p>A handsome man entered.</p><br/><p>But Myormiles would not be deceived.</p><br/><p>This man too was a fallen noble who had once tried to sell some junk at high price using his name.</p><br/><p>He probably came with another idea and is seeking money.</p><br/><p>But, if anything, he is a noble. Myormiles verified this himself.</p><br/><p>So rudeness towards a true noble could be fatal. Which makes this job all the harder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother stupid idea is it,\u201d he thought, and inquired the guest.</p><br/><p>And he was right.</p><br/><p>It really was rubbish.</p><br/><p>In short, I\u2019ll open a new store using my slaves, so give me money! He said.</p><br/><p>Frankly, he can\u2019t see this idea succeeding. A store needs a lot more than cute girls to be successful.</p><br/><p>Research the market and the buyers, consider the location, and pay for the girls\u2019 children.</p><br/><p>Just because they are slaves does not mean they will work for free\u2013they need food and shelter after all. There\u2019s also initial costs to consider.</p><br/><p>Opening a brothel also requires one to consider the chance for disease to spread.</p><br/><p>If it does, not only the noble, but Myormiles himself would be indicted.</p><br/><p>So this is not something he could accept.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy, what a discerning eye you have, Kazak-sama.</p><br/><p>But, regarding these female slaves, that would prove impossible, wouldn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>Human slave trade has been forbidden and opening a store with illegal slaves would be\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, about that\u2026 here\u2019s the thing. All is solved when a noble pays the right people some money.</p><br/><p>So, you know? Oh and this is a secret\u2026 but those slaves are elves\u300d</p><br/><p>He said in a haughty manner.</p><br/><p>Myormiles got a heartburn just listening to Count Kazak, but stifled his displeasure.</p><br/><p>As a merchant, he can\u2019t show a customer displeasure. Even a novice merchant knows that.</p><br/><p>So how should he refuse him\u2026</p><br/><p>And the moment he began to say something,</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! How have you been, Myormiles-kun!\u300d</p><br/><p>The door burst open and in walked a person while greeting him.</p><br/><p>A beautiful girl (boy?) with silver hair, golden eyes walked in.</p><br/><p>Who can\u2019t possible be here\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Could it be, Rimuru-danna?\u300d</p><br/><p>A profoundly surprised voice escaped his lips.</p><br/><p>Huh? Didn\u2019t Rimuru-dana become a demon lord? So Fuze-sama had said\u2026</p><br/><p>And he is not wearing a mask? So he was this cute without it?!</p><br/><p>These thoughts filling his head, he had completely forgot about Count Kazak.</p><br/><p>And then he heard,</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease wait! Master is currently with a guest!\u300d</p><br/><p>A panicking attendant attempted to stop him.</p><br/><p>Chances are, he had missed Rimuru coming in and was too late in stopping him.</p><br/><p>What a failure. But chances are, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop him anyways.</p><br/><p>So Myormiles could hardly get angry at the attendant.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, sorry. You were with a guest, huh. Well then, I\u2019ll wait in your store!\u300d</p><br/><p>And flashing an insincere smile, Rimuru added\u300ePardon my rudeness\u2026 nah, my bad!\u300f</p><br/><p>And leaving everyone dumbfounded he left.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Myormiles ended the discussion with Count Kazak, and cleared his schedule for the rest of the day.</p><br/><p>A great wave was beginning to move the world.</p><br/><p>What was more important?</p><br/><p>Myormiles was not a fool who could not understand that much.</p><br/><p>He was certainly a person who could find ore within a stone.</p><br/><p>But! There was something he could create even if he were to abandon everything.</p><br/><p>A short acquaintanceship but large profit? That didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Most important was his obligation to consider the long term benefit of his business partners\u2013fellow merchants.</p><br/><p>He had intended to visit himself when things calmed down.</p><br/><p>That is, he has heard that after becoming a demon lord Rimuru has gone off to attend Walpurgis Banquet.</p><br/><p>So he could hardly take any action until he was sure of the changes.</p><br/><p>And yet the person himself had visited as if nothing had changed.</p><br/><p>So meeting with this person was by far the most important thing he had to do.</p><br/><p>Remembering every strategy he knows, and hiding the pure joy that was filling his heart, Myormiles rushed to his store.</p><br/><p>What wicked plan would he propose today?</p><br/><p>And thus, Myormiles tedious days would come to an end.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

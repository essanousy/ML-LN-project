That\u2019s not like me. Maybe I\u2019ve been depending on him more than I thought\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman muttered as he remembered the situation they had been in.</p><br/><p>This was not the time to be worrying about others. They themselves were in a precarious situation.</p><br/><p>And so Karman dismissed all thoughts of Veldora from his mind.</p><br/><p>(There is no point in worrying about that man now. It seems that the Six Tyrant has already been activated\u2026)</p><br/><p>That devil\u2019s roar had boomed far off in the distance.</p><br/><p>It was the sound of immense energy running wild after it had been sealed in an Ether Ring Barrier.</p><br/><p>The barrier was stretching and affecting the space outside of it.</p><br/><p>With such a terrifying weapon in front of him, even Veldora would not be able to do anything. That\u2019s what Karman thought, but he did not voice it.</p><br/><p>But maybe Veldora would\u2026surely he could\u2026 There was just a little hope left in his heart.</p><br/><p>And he felt that voicing his doubts would erase the last of that hope.</p><br/><p>And so Karman turned his attention towards the taking in of his surroundings.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he had only lost consciousness for a short time.</p><br/><p>According to the clock in his brain, three minutes had not passed since they crashed into the ground.</p><br/><p>While he checked the time, he also learned of his condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but mutter.</p><br/><p>\u2018All clear.\u2019 Those were the words that were displayed in his head.</p><br/><p>The numbers were supposed to appear in red to show damage, but now they were all blue\u2026there was no problem\u2026</p><br/><p>Karman was shocked at this unbelievable durability.</p><br/><p>He now knew that he was alright, but what about the others?</p><br/><p>He thought as he looked around\u2026</p><br/><p>Then he discovered them. They were still unconscious.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you guys. Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>He called. And they groaned.</p><br/><p>While they had moderate injuries, it seemed that they were all safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuchhhh! It doesn\u2019t actually hurt at all. It\u2019s times like these that I\u2019m happy to be a complete cyborg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then again, you require maintenance over the smallest things. Mister Zaza tried to hide it, but it seemed like all sorts of functions had been shut down. He would not have lasted much longer had Veldora not modified him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. However, it was all for nothing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot! Don\u2019t say such a thing!! Mister Veldora is with them. They are surely all right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman shouted and they all quieted down.</p><br/><p>Then they looked at each other and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early to give up. We have to do what we can!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye. Now, let\u2019s go and find the Powered Suits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman ordered, and they all moved at once.</p><br/><p>No one asked, \u2018what if they are broken?\u2019</p><br/><p>Finding a method of travel was absolutely necessary for them to leave this wasteland that was full of danger.</p><br/><p>If they could not do that, then they would have to wait to be rescued.</p><br/><p>For that reason, they would at least have to find a means of communication.</p><br/><p>The Powered Suits were likely broken.</p><br/><p>However, if they gathered the remains of the ship and its equipment, they might find a way out of their predicament. That\u2019s what Karman thought.</p><br/><p>They all knew him well, and so they guessed at what his intention was.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>They stopped again, shortly after moving.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m so glad I came to have a look, just in case. To think that not a single one of you has died. You are pretty tough for vermin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, what a surprise. According to my data, there was a 99.9% chance of all of you dying. It\u2019s impossible that you all survived. So, Mister Karman. What sort of trick did you use?\u201d</p><br/><p>A threat had appeared before them in no time\u2014Jegyll and Reiz. And their men were now in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk. Back to square one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman spat.</p><br/><p>It had clearly been too early for relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that, Reiz. Karman. I am quite interested in your body now. Perhaps the science behind it is more advanced than I thought. You must come to the city with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! So you can slaughter and dissect us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr we could kill you here and bring your bodies back, if you prefer? If you\u2019ll come willingly, we will spare you your lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jegyll said with an expression that looked honest enough.</p><br/><p>However, Karman laughed at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you take us for fools? There is no reason for you to keep us alive. You\u2019re just trying to trick us, and spare yourself a fight. Aren\u2019t you? I can tell by your eyes. You don\u2019t see us as humans. If you\u2019re going to kill us anyway, then I\u2019ll fight until the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll show you what we\u2019re made of!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karman and his men shouted in answer.</p><br/><p>Jegyll heard this, and the smile disappeared from her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all very hard to understand. You people are most strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Jegyll. Let\u2019s just get this over with and kill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reiz was no longer smiling either. He looked at Karman and his men with a cold, appraising look.</p><br/><p>Alien.</p><br/><p>Yes, Jegyll and Reiz were not human.</p><br/><p>They may have had the appearance, but they were Bionoids.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>The fight started abruptly.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t Karman and his men that were attacked.</p><br/><p>It was Jegyll and her men.</p><br/><p>Gigantic lifeforms had suddenly appeared and attacked them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuper Beasts! Here\u2019s our chance! Let\u2019s hide!\u201d</p><br/><p>No, it was surely just a coincidence.</p><br/><p>The Super Beasts must have heard the explosion of the ship and come down to search for prey.</p><br/><p>However, this ended up saving Karman\u2019s life.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

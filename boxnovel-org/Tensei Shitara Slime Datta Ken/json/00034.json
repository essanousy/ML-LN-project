I wonder\u2026..</p><br/><p>Forest Disturbance Arc</p><br/><p>Chapter 34 \u2013 The Outbreak of War</p><br/><p>That day, the orcs army filled the marshes with thousands of troops.</p><br/><p>If you looked from above, you\u2019d see the swarming the tunnels as if an incessant maelstrom.</p><br/><p>However, those present were only a small part of their army. The orcs decided to invade by circling around the lake.</p><br/><p>With little resistance they had occupied the marshes, and proceeded into the caverns.</p><br/><p>However, a commotion rippled through the swarm.</p><br/><p>For suddenly someone had ordered the lizardmen to attack.</p><br/><p>And that was the cause for the outbreak of war between the orcs and the lizardmen.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>The rulers of the marshes\u2013the Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>Possessing high battle abilities they can maneuver smoothly through mud or swamp.</p><br/><p>Hiding among the grass, they approached the orc army, and attacked undetected.</p><br/><p>Everything went according to plan.</p><br/><p>He had locked up the previous head in an underground chamber, reorganized the army, and had them relocate above ground.</p><br/><p>And, quickly assuming battle formations, he began an attack on the orcs.</p><br/><p>Gabil was not completely incompetent. He did lack the ability to see the bigger picture, but he certainly could lead a squad in battle.</p><br/><p>That ability he had inherited from his father, the former chief.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen respected strength.</p><br/><p>Thus, they wouldn\u2019t follow someone who only boasted of his strength.</p><br/><p>Gabil idolized an individual. For his sake, he had to display his competence.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>He left a thousand warriors to guard the main chamber.</p><br/><p>It was occupied only by women and other civilians. If they have to, the women can also fight, but they lack the necessary strength.</p><br/><p>For that reason, he had been sending 500 extra troops at a time to the main chamber.</p><br/><p>That is, Gabil decided to gradually reinforce that defense line with troops fighting in the tunnels.</p><br/><p>Having cleared thus relocated the troops, Gabil obtained control over the entire army.</p><br/><p>Their numbers: 7,000 goblins and 8,000 lizardmen.</p><br/><p>That was his fighting strength.</p><br/><p>Without depending on the labyrinth, he proceeded to meet his foe above ground.</p><br/><p>And leaving the bare minimum for defense, he deployed everyone to battle.</p><br/><p>The first attack was as described.</p><br/><p>They successfully divided the enemy and landed a devastating attack on their flanks.</p><br/><p>The orcs that the lizardmen scattered were hunted down by the goblins.</p><br/><p>Following Gabil\u2019s orders to the letter, the troops performed exceedingly well.</p><br/><p>The goblins, too, fought earnestly. Thus, they were able to advance with the rest of the troops.</p><br/><p>The success of the attack could thus be attributed to the ideal cooperation of individual units.</p><br/><p>Behold!</p><br/><p>Gabil thought. There is no need to fear the orcs!</p><br/><p>Father has gone senile. Thus he worried needlessly.</p><br/><p>I will calm his fears.</p><br/><p>After seeing my heroic feats, he will surely recognize me as the next head. For that end, we must clean up the orcs at once.</p><br/><p>Or maybe this whole scenario was planned out to pass the leadership onto me! So he thought.</p><br/><p>A cry for joy filled the field.</p><br/><p>Look at them! The lowly orcs are no match for the great Lizardmen!</p><br/><p>Proud of his work, Gabil observed the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Things have gone well\u2026 until now.</p><br/><p>Having lost many soldiers, the orcs must have been walloping in despair.</p><br/><p>But Gabil did not know, the terror of the Orc Lord.</p><br/><p>That the Head had known, the terror of the Orc Lord.</p><br/><p>That difference now bared its fangs.</p><br/><p>*Guchaguchaguchagucha*</p><br/><p>The orcs were walking on the dead.</p><br/><p>On all fours, crawling over them. No, wait!</p><br/><p>They were not walking on them, they were eating them. A gruesome sight.</p><br/><p>The brave lizardmen warriors, hardened in many battles, this was an unusual sight.</p><br/><p>A sinister aura wrapped around the orcs.</p><br/><p>One warrior who was frightened by this sight, tried to retreat a step and fell backwards.</p><br/><p>Without missing this chance, the orcs swarmed the warrior.</p><br/><p>He was dragged into the mud and ripped limb from limb.</p><br/><p>Since the war had begun, he was the first casualty.</p><br/><p>And that began it all.</p><br/><p>The orcs that were devouring stranded soldiers gradually obtained their abilities.</p><br/><p>That ability was not like [Predator], and could not perfectly replicate the skills.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, they absorbed the lizardmen\u2019s power to some degree, and shared it among those in their domain.</p><br/><p>That was one of the effects of the unique skill [Starving Ones].</p><br/><p>They were as much one swarm as they were an individual. Again, quiet similar to the shared evolution of the fang wolf species.</p><br/><p>That is why the previous head was so afraid of letting any lizardmen die.</p><br/><p>For the sake of not allowing the orcs to develop any further.</p><br/><p>Although they could not obtain all the abilities of those that ate, they could still acquire some of their special features.</p><br/><p>For example, the ability of the lizardmen to move freely through mud and swamp.</p><br/><p>For example, growing scales around their vital areas to defend.</p><br/><p>This kind of trivial changes they could do.</p><br/><p>However, that is how they can quickly change the tide of battle.</p><br/><p>\u300cFear not! Show them the power of the high and proud Lizardmen!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The lizardmen regained their morale from Gabil\u2019s cry.</p><br/><p>They were rulers of the marshes fighting on their own land; they attacked again.</p><br/><p>Their were still faster than the orcs, that much they were sure of.</p><br/><p>Even if they are overwhelmed by numbers, should they retreat to their defense lines they could surely crush the enemy again.</p><br/><p>However!</p><br/><p>When they tried to outflank the orcs again, they were met with a ready formation.</p><br/><p>The orcs movements have gotten faster.</p><br/><p>Strange. Thought Gabil, but far too late.</p><br/><p>Without the advantage in speed, they were now surrounded by many orcs.</p><br/><p>Five thousands troops have already cut off Gabil\u2019s escape.</p><br/><p>And they pressed their attack.</p><br/><p>Having too much faith in their speed, they blindly pursued the orcs in their retreat, and were thus surrounded.</p><br/><p>Perhaps if the orcs were not under the influence of their lord, Gabil\u2019s group could have endured this predicament.</p><br/><p>One could continue discussing such suppositions without an end. The truth of the matter is: they were completely surrounded.</p><br/><p>As ants block of their prey\u2019s escape, so the orcs swarm them.</p><br/><p>Even if they fought with all their might, they will surely succumb soon.</p><br/><p>How could that be? Gabil could not understand.</p><br/><p>He desperately tried to rally his forces, screaming words of encouragement.</p><br/><p>However, the Goblins have lost formation out of panic, and the Lizardmen trembled in worry.</p><br/><p>This is bad. Thinking thus, he wanted to issue an order to retreat\u2026 but even he understood that they had no place to run to.</p><br/><p>To gather them all under his banner, he had forced the warriors to vacate the caverns.</p><br/><p>Even if had ordered a desperate retreat into the tunnels, the entrance was far too narrow.</p><br/><p>The goblins who would be running in first would obstruct their escape.</p><br/><p>And, without a way in, they would be slaughtered by the orcs.</p><br/><p>If they instead ran into the forest\u2026 they would be pursued and slaughtered.</p><br/><p>They could not retreat.</p><br/><p>Gabil understood that well.</p><br/><p>Why had his father fought in such a cowardly way? He had finally understood.</p><br/><p>Just how much of an idiot was I? Thought Gabil. But there was no time for regret now.</p><br/><p>Right now, Gabil had only one thing he could do. Increase the morale and lessen the worries of his comrades.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuwahahaha! What a worried face you all make! I am here! There is no way I can lose to some orcs!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yes, to encourage his allies by saying something he himself did not believe.</p><br/><p>Their fate had been decided\u2026</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen\u2019s Head sighed.</p><br/><p>He was full of regrets.</p><br/><p>That, for one, he had mentioned the terror that Orc Lord was only in fairy tales.</p><br/><p>No, he had mentioned it at other occasions. However, the fact that he failed to convey his terror now caused the Head endless regret.</p><br/><p>Had he explained it properly, maybe Gabil would have been more vigilant.</p><br/><p>But now it\u2019s too late. With a sigh, he cast such thoughts away.</p><br/><p>They still had things they needed to do.</p><br/><p>His kind, gathered in the main chamber, looked anxious.</p><br/><p>Four paths lead to the chamber, one could be used to escape.</p><br/><p>The orcs could not come from the escape route\u2026 probably. It was a direct route into the forest. This was the only route that you couldn\u2019t get lost in; one that they had dug themselves.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they needed to observe the other four.</p><br/><p>The units fighting in the tunnels slowly withdrew and reassembled in the main chamber.</p><br/><p>The chamber\u2019s defense line currently consisted of 1,500 soldiers. There were also probably some who have yet to withdraw.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the orcs are numerous.</p><br/><p>They will probably soon discover this place.</p><br/><p>Hopefully, the remaining soldiers will return before they do\u2026</p><br/><p>The head briefly glances down the escape route.</p><br/><p>With all their brethren gathering, the large chamber now feels very tight.</p><br/><p>If they had to escape at a moment\u2019s notice, it\u2019s hard to imagine them all being able to withdraw safely.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they need to begin evacuating small groups at a time.</p><br/><p>Whichever he chooses, the situation is bound to become chaotic. However, he must decrease the chance of extinction no matter what it takes.</p><br/><p>However, even if they escape into the forest, the orcs will discover them sooner or later.</p><br/><p>And even if they are successful with their escape, surviving may prove impossible.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the Head could not order the evacuation.</p><br/><p>The only thing he can do is buy time.</p><br/><p>Whether they come or not, he doesn\u2019t know; but, he still bet all on the reinforcements.</p><br/><p>The Head\u2019s suffering seemed as if it would continue on forever.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Lizardmen\u2019s Guard Captain escaped into the forest.</p><br/><p>Feeling an aura of strength, he headed in its direction.</p><br/><p>Though the lizardmen boasted of high mobility in the marshes, the same could not be said about the forest.</p><br/><p>His breath ragged, his pulse unstable, the Captain fatigued quickly.</p><br/><p>However, he had to keep running.</p><br/><p>His sprint could decide the future of his race.</p><br/><p>And like that he continued for three hours.</p><br/><p>As if ignoring his bodily limits, he earnestly pressed on. Pressing on by will alone, he could collapse at any moment.</p><br/><p>He was well aware of the fact.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he did not know if the demon named Souei was in fact up ahead.</p><br/><p>Whether he would agree to help, he also did not know.</p><br/><p>Should he even bother running?</p><br/><p>That thought crept from the dark corners of his mind. However, he refused to entertain the thought.</p><br/><p>He failed to stop Gabil\u2019s foolishness. So he believed.</p><br/><p>He had known that Gabil desired to be recognized by the Head.</p><br/><p>However, he had not mentioned it to the Head. The Lizardmen\u2019s hero, Gabil.</p><br/><p>He was also one of those who respected Gabil.</p><br/><p>To take responsibility for his mistake, the Captain could not abandon his mission.</p><br/><p>If he stopped, he would not be able to run again.</p><br/><p>Thus, he pressed on.</p><br/><p>There was someone who saw this desperate sprint.</p><br/><p>Though the Captain himself had not noticed that being.</p><br/><p>That being pursued the Captain soundlessly from branch to branch.</p><br/><p>Was he conversing with someone? Without a partner in sight and without a voice, he appeared to be in the middle of a conversation.</p><br/><p>After it had ended, he nodded once.</p><br/><p>And,</p><br/><p>\u300cYour will be done. I will act as you have commanded.\u300d</p><br/><p>Muttering thus, he swooped down in front of the Captain!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

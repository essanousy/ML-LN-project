Even though I especially called back a deceased soul for your sake. I thought you would be pleased, so I prepared the present secretly\u2026\u2026 I guess you didn\u2019t like it?\u300d</p><br/><p>A clear voice reached Milim\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t need to turn around.</p><br/><p>The owner of the voice was\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s you, Velda. You bastard, I hope you are prepared for it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPrepared\u2026\u2026 For what I wonder?\u300d</p><br/><p>Against Milim\u2019s expression filled with wrath, Velda still had a cool smile.</p><br/><p>Two contrasting emotions were clashing as the two faced each other.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t contacted Rimuru yet, but Milim wasn\u2019t worried about it.</p><br/><p>Since she felt residues of the Hero Chloe at the time she buried Lucia just a little while ago.</p><br/><p>It was a very splendid sword slash that crossed over even\u300eMultiple Existence\u300f and reached Lucia\u2019s main body. It happened just for an instant, but Milim wouldn\u2019t fail to notice it.</p><br/><p>It was the time for the people who were being controlled by Lucia in the surface to be released. Although, it seemed Rimuru had schemed something as he lurked inside the shadow and perhaps already worked out some countermeasures for it.</p><br/><p>If she thought like that, even if she didn\u2019t bother to contact him, she believed that everything would be conveyed to Rimuru even if she stayed in this place.</p><br/><p>The fool called Vega was the first one to be eliminated by Rimuru\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>The small fry called Kazaream seemed to have fallen as he couldn\u2019t defeat Leon.</p><br/><p>She also knew about Dagruel\u2019s defeat as Lucia was raising a fuss about it.</p><br/><p>Although where Dino was and what he was doing was unknown, Milim thought that it was pointless even to be worried about that cunning man. She knew that he would suddenly appear sooner or later after all.</p><br/><p>In other words, it could be said that Velda\u2019s subordinates were all defeated.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems that your prided Four Unholy Commanders have all been defeated. You\u2019re the only one left, Velda. I shall have you receive the reward for making me angry.\u300d</p><br/><p>As Milim said so, she pulled out the demonic sword \u201cEarth\u201d and took a stance.</p><br/><p>Velda looked at Milim with a smile while shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll play with you, Milim.\u300d</p><br/><p>Those words became the signal.</p><br/><p>Milim easily demonstrated continuous sword techniques.</p><br/><p>However, Velda avoided everything by a paper-thin margin.</p><br/><p>He was still unarmed and had leeway for his attitude against Milim.</p><br/><p>That ignited Milim\u2019s anger and the demonic sword \u201cEarth\u201d began pulsing as if it had reacted to it.</p><br/><p>The rusts on the surface of the sword disappeared, showing its bluish-white blade. It seemed that the blade was strengthened as it absorbed waves of her anger.</p><br/><p>\u300cDie! Drago Break[5]!!\u300d</p><br/><p>A ferocious slash like an embodiment of Milim\u2019s wrath was heading towards the defenseless Velda.</p><br/><p>However\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cToo bad. You\u2019re a bit slow.\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda easily stepped back with just a bit movement and dodged Milim\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>But, that was as Milim\u2019s planned.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe time for destruction is now!\u300d</p><br/><p>The moment Velda evaded Milim\u2019s sword, their position was now reversed.</p><br/><p>Milim stood in front of the throne while Velda stood on the ground below the throne.</p><br/><p>Plus, on the very rear of Velda\u2019s position\u2015\u2015 soared the Heaven Gate, the only gateway connecting the Heaven and the surface world.</p><br/><p>From the very beginning, Milim aimed for the chance to simultaneously attack both Velda and the Heaven Gate.</p><br/><p>With the demonic sword \u201cEarth\u201d in her right hand, and her left hand charged with Destruction Intent.</p><br/><p>Right now, Milim unleashed Drago Nova at full power towards Velda.</p><br/><p>A bluish-white light beam which resembled a sparkling star\u2019s light overlapped repetitively and pierced through Velda.</p><br/><p>It pressurized the surroundings as the beam bulged and expanded to pierce everything towards the entrance from which Milim entered from.</p><br/><p>A flood of light was born, blowing away all of the lined up pillars.</p><br/><p>And beyond them was the soaring wall of the Heaven Gate.</p><br/><p>Everything was as Milim planned.</p><br/><p>The bluish-white light beam penetrated through Velda as its power increased and pierced the Heaven Gate.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>As the lights subsided, half of the Sky Castle had been cleanly blown away and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Only half of the castle remained behind where Milim stood.</p><br/><p>However, the Heaven Gate was still intact.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t unharmed as there were numerous cracks on it, but it had endured Milim\u2019s strongest attack.</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not it.</p><br/><p>(I saw the light had gotten refracted just before the impact, could it be\u2015\u2015)</p><br/><p>Milim didn\u2019t let her guard down.</p><br/><p>That was the right decision.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm, as one would expect from my daughter. I never expected that you can make cracks to this impassable gate.\u300d</p><br/><p>There was someone who spoke in an excited voice towards Milim.</p><br/><p>Needless to say, it was Velda.</p><br/><p>Velda, who was unharmed, had sat on the throne behind Milim before she noticed.</p><br/><p>While suppressing her astonishment, Milim calmly turned around to face Velda.</p><br/><p>\u300cOho\u2026\u2026? For you to be unscathed after being hit by Drago Nova\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, it was the ultimate magic that caused a supernova explosion with a super-high compression. It\u2019s the ultimate perfected form of nuclear strike magic \u201cGravity Collapse[6]\u201d, but it\u2019s impossible to be use unless the user can manipulate Stardust[7] freely. It\u2019s indeed an ultimate magic fitting for you. But, you see\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda began to explain heedlessly to Milim who unintentionally expressed her disbelief. He created a thin light membrane on his hand as to show Milim and continued his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u300cI can also manipulate stardust. It\u2019s easy to avert the impact since I directed the destruction so it only affected a limited area.\u300d</p><br/><p>So he explained.</p><br/><p>Velda seemed to be surprised that her power could affect the impassable gate, but it wasn\u2019t that surprising for Milim.</p><br/><p>Velda had said it easily, but it was an impossible feat unless he could read Milim\u2019s thoughts and understood her aim completely.</p><br/><p>More importantly, there was no one who could manipulate stardust except Milim.</p><br/><p>It was an ultimate magic with the only way to defend against it was to do a lot of work of casting nuclear strike magic repeatedly in order to offset it which even Guy couldn\u2019t do \u2026\u2026 But, right now, Velda had shown that he could easily manipulate it.</p><br/><p>In other words, it was no more than a magic which could easily be blocked for Velda and Milim had lost one of her trump cards.</p><br/><p>(What a monster\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>For the first time, Milim experienced Velda\u2019s true strength in the truest sense.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, are you done now? Since I will have you make a child with me, I don\u2019t want to hurt you. You should have played around enough, right? Please be obedient now.\u300d</p><br/><p>With a gentle smile, Velda said so as if he was persuading a child.</p><br/><p>Milim desperately racked her head for something.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there nothing I can do?\u201d Milim sought for a telling blow to Velda by making full use of her computation prediction.</p><br/><p>However, her calculation indicated a merciless result that everything was useless even with her high abilities.</p><br/><p>(Kuh, I should have waited for Rimuru and his subordinates to come here\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>At the moment when Milim regretted her action\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015Crack\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>So, a small sound echoed in the place.</p><br/><p>Milim moved her sight to see the origin of the sound.</p><br/><p>It also attracted Velda\u2019s attention as he did the same as Milim.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?\u300d</p><br/><p>And for the first time, Velda\u2019s expression was filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>Right now, there was a huge crack on the towering Heaven Gate that blocked everyone from passing.</p><br/><p>And then\u2015\u2015light came flowing from the crack and the gate crumbled immediately after a thunderous sound.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood grief. What a sturdy gate, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTotally. I didn\u2019t expect that even with the three of us it would repel our attack over and over again.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. I thought that it would be an easy task when we received the order from Rimuru-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>While conversing like that, three women passed through the gate and came to invade.</p><br/><p>Testarossa, Ultima and Carrera.</p><br/><p>Under Rimuru\u2019s order, they had finally succeeded in destroying the Heaven Gate.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, there seemed to be an impact from the inside at the end\u2015\u2015\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, there are some people here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2015\u2015I see, there was a commotion inside or something like that.\u300d</p><br/><p>The three shifted their focus to Milim and Velda and seemed to have guessed the circumstances.</p><br/><p>Testarossa smiled wickedly and pierced Velda with her cold gaze.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, you two. If we kill that guy, won\u2019t all the achievements be ours?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, right! It seems we are the first to arrive here!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMilim-sama seems to be struggling too, she probably won\u2019t complain if we help her.\u300d</p><br/><p>The other two agreed to Testarossa\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>And so, the three people confronted Velda with their respective weapons in hand.</p><br/><p> \u25c7\u25c7\u25c7</p><br/><p>Milim analyzed the situation and thought of their winning percentages.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Rimuru had made the necessary preparations with exquisite timing as Milim had expected.</p><br/><p>She was unsure whether they could compete against Velda, but if they could distract Velda even momentarily, Milim could land a full power Drago Break.</p><br/><p>If she condensed Drago Nova\u2019s energy and made it explode inside Velda\u2019s body, even Velda who could manipulate stardust could do nothing but to perish.</p><br/><p>Milim concluded so instantly.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys, sorry but please lend me your help!\u300d</p><br/><p>The three demons delightfully nodded to Milim\u2019s shout.</p><br/><p>Her path to victory had been shut before, but she could now see a path opening even though it was only a small one.</p><br/><p>Velda looked at Milim uninterestedly and shifted his sight to see the three demons.</p><br/><p>Then he said,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s troublesome to play with people other than Milim. I shall prepare suitable opponents for you guys.\u300d</p><br/><p>He announced so and took out an orb to his hand.</p><br/><p>Milim and the three demons were wary of Velda\u2019s action.</p><br/><p>However, something was created in an instant.</p><br/><p>Two people were standing in front of Velda.</p><br/><p>An old man dressed in luxurious black clothes.</p><br/><p>A short-haired soldier dressed in the former Empire Army\u2019s official uniform.</p><br/><p>The two surveyed their surroundings as they looked strangely confused.</p><br/><p>\u300cI, I\u2019m certain that I should have died after I entrusted the girl with my techniques\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy am I here? I\u2019m alive\u2015\u2015 No, that\u2019s impossible.\u300d</p><br/><p>They were Damrada who had entrusted his techniques to Ultima and Kondou Tatsuya who had entrusted his Will to Carrera.</p><br/><p>However, they were not the real one.</p><br/><p>That was proven from their reaction.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, you guys seem to have woken up. How\u2019s the body\u2019s condition?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Velda-sama! It is very good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s been a long time, Velda-sama. For you to call me, do you have a mission for me?\u300d</p><br/><p>Damrada and Kondou took a pose to show their loyalty in front of Velda.</p><br/><p>Their current appearance was something you couldn\u2019t imagine from them when they were alive.</p><br/><p>Ultima and Carrera were stunned when they looked at the two.</p><br/><p>It was truly unbelievable, but the two appeared so similar to the real ones.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t be deceived! They are just copies harboring their memories. Moreover\u2015\u2015Velda had rewritten the memories to his likings\u2026\u2026 their real selves\u2019 soul had disappeared, right? Not even a god can revive the dead!\u300d</p><br/><p>From Milim\u2019s shout, Ultima and Carrera also realized the truth.</p><br/><p>Velda\u2019s cheerful voice reached them.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. They and the maid I made a while ago for Milim have the same principle. Strangely, I can\u2019t collect memories of a living person and I can only use it once. This Memory Orb[8] can reproduce a deceased person\u2019s memories.\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda said so while fiddling around with the third orb he took out.</p><br/><p>And, he continued talking.</p><br/><p>\u300cI collected the angels\u2019 energy to this orb as the core and created a temporary body for them. They can\u2019t act on the surface, but that doesn\u2019t matter here. Besides, even if I used a lot of unskilled personalities or even if I tried to evolve them into Manas, they weren\u2019t strong\u2026\u2026 This time I tried to replicate those with a strong will. With energy comparable to ten awakened demon lords and a strong will. How about it, don\u2019t you think they are strong?\u300d</p><br/><p>Velda explained while laughing.</p><br/><p>As they understood the meaning of his words, the demons\u2019 expressions were dyed with anger.</p><br/><p>Tampering with a person\u2019s soul was the demons\u2019 specialty. Therefore, they didn\u2019t intend to complain about it.</p><br/><p>However, playing with the memories of the people whom they acknowledged was a blasphemy to them.</p><br/><p>Demons were fundamentally selfish, even if they could tolerate their own actions, that didn\u2019t mean they could tolerate others\u2019 actions.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt appears that he really wants to die.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m so mad now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMaking me angry isn\u2019t something that is easy to be done.\u300d</p><br/><p>The three demons, who couldn\u2019t look at themselves objectively, declared their anger in their own way.</p><br/><p>And, that was the same for Milim.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t let your guard down. I\u2019ll be Velda\u2019s opponent, but I can\u2019t hold out for long. Get rid of those impostors quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>She ordered those words to the three.</p><br/><p>Thus, the fight in the Heaven had begun.</p><br/><p>[1]  Tentei, made from kanji of Heaven and Sovereign.

Whether it was fashion lovers or fans passing by, they flocked to the World Supermodels Organization\u2019s official website and waited for the announcement of the rankings that was one month late!</p><br/><p>This time, as if it knew that it had stirred up the public\u2019s anger, the world supermodel leaderboards started to change one hour after this announcement was sent out!</p><br/><p>\u300e The world\u2019s male supermodels ranked 91-100\uff1a</p><br/><p>Bobby Bell, Brown Beck, Zhang Yingshu, Han Donglie, Yamato Yosuke\u2026 \u300f</p><br/><p>All the fans: Damn, you are still breathing! \uff08/= \uff3f =\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534!!!</p><br/><p>The World Supermodels Organization uncharacteristically released 10 names first! Once the 10 names were released, seven of the 10 supermodels expressed their feelings on Weibo or Twitter, talking about how hard it was to get on the list.</p><br/><p>In fact, it wasn\u2019t just fans concerned about the bizarre situation of these rankings. Even the models couldn\u2019t help using their phones or computers to refresh the World Supermodels Organization\u2019s official website, waiting for the other party to hurry up. People were worried about the leaderboard.</p><br/><p>After the first 10 names came out, many Western fans and Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s sunspots ridiculed: \u3010 Haha, he didn\u2019t appear in the 91st-100th names. Are you still delusional about Ming Yu going up? It is a fantasy! Go home and sleep! \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans confidently rebutted: \u3010 Who told you that not appearing in the 91st-100th names isn\u2019t being on the rankings? The supermodels ahead of the 90th rank won\u2019t agree, hehe! \u3011</p><br/><p>After 10 minutes, another 10 names were officially announced:</p><br/><p>\u300e The world\u2019s male supermodels ranked 81-90\uff1a</p><br/><p>Edward Locke, Li Xin, Zhao Yucheng\u2026 \u300f</p><br/><p>Sunspots: \u3010 Haha, do you think that Ming Yu will be in the top 80? This is the biggest joke I\u2019ve heard in the 21st century, hahahaha! \u3011</p><br/><p>Mushroom\u2019s fans: \u3010 Oh, it is only 80 people. Do you dare to look again? \u3011</p><br/><p>10 minutes later:</p><br/><p>\u300e The world\u2019s male supermodels ranked 71-80\uff1a\u2026\u2026 \u300f</p><br/><p>Another ten names were announced and Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were quiet. The sunspots laughed excitedly. \u3010 No, it isn\u2019t there? Hahahaha! Few people can advance into the top 70 in their first time. You group of mushroom fans, wake up quickly! \u3011</p><br/><p>But many Ming Xiaoyu fans gritted their teeth and said: \u3010 This is only the 70s! In addition! I believe in Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s strength. His performance is very good and he can definitely get a ranking! \u3011</p><br/><p>In fact, 70~100 was the estimated ranking of most netizens. According to their thoughts, they were 70% confident that Ming Yu could enter the world supermodel rankings. But if he wanted to squeeze out a higher rank, they were afraid that it would be really difficult.</p><br/><p>You know, in the past there were 90 supermodels who reached the 70s in their first time. They were very strong dark horses. Now a model who just became a supermodel wanted to enter the top 70, how could it be easy?</p><br/><p>Therefore, many Ming Xiaoyu fans became discouraged when the 71st-100th names were announced. They had a voice in their hearts telling them: Ming Xiaoyu will definitely do it! We have to believe in him! He is working hard and we are also desperately supporting him. He definitely can do it!</p><br/><p>But their reason told them: It is impossible to rush into the top 70 at once. This is simply a fantasy.</p><br/><p>However, they still had a bit of hope. You must know that Du Ruo rushed to the 61st rank her first time. Then she climbed the rankings at a very fast speed, steadily ranking 3rd. Then in the last ranking, she broke through to 2nd place.</p><br/><p>In that case, couldn\u2019t Ming Xiaoyu do it?</p><br/><p>Yes! In their hearts, Ming Xiaoyu was no worse than Du Ruo!</p><br/><p>Although they thought this way, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were smothered when the 61st-70th rankings were officially announced. They repeatedly looked at the list. Finally, some sensitive fans even had tears dripping down.</p><br/><p>There was no Ming Yu in the 61st-70th rankings!</p><br/><p>Now that it was to this extent, it wasn\u2019t possible!</p><br/><p>Could Ming Yu create a model and advance into the top 60 as a model who didn\u2019t debut with a top luxury brand?</p><br/><p>The clamoring of the sunspots and Western fans became louder after the 61st-70th rankings were announced. They scoffed at this group of self-righteous Ming Yu fans. Some of them even talked about the prizes that that fans prepared.</p><br/><p>\u3010 No wonder why the prizes are so generous. It is impossible for this model to appear in the rankings, haha! \u3011</p><br/><p>At this, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans could only grit their teeth and stubbornly reply: \u3010 The rankings aren\u2019t over yet. Why are you so happy? \u3011 This sentence was just typed when the 51st-60th rankings was published after being late 30 minutes.</p><br/><p>The fans stopped the screen for a while. After five seconds, there were roars of laughter. \u3010 Hahaha, his name isn\u2019t in the 51st-60th ranks. There is nothing in the 51st-60th ranks! I\u2019m really laughing to death! Do you really think Ming Yu can make it into the top 50? That is a crazy dream! Luo Cheng debuted in the high-end Yizhi show as the finale model and only reached the 43rd rank. Is it possible to compare with him? \u3011</p><br/><p>Now most Ming Xiaoyu fans were silent and didn\u2019t talk anymore. Many of them on the other side of the phone and computer were biting their lips so hard that they were bleeding and their eyes were full of tears.</p><br/><p>It was really nothing if Ming Yu didn\u2019t appear in the rankings this time. There were 371 supermodels in the world and only 200 spots in the rankings. Not many models would appear in the rankings the first time after becoming a supermodel.</p><br/><p>But these people were using a sarcastic tone to laugh at Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s efforts.</p><br/><p>The fans really didn\u2019t understand! Being the \u2018best-dressed male\u2019 at the RAmer Charity Gala, walking in the Ruth Mary high-end show, becoming Dusha\u2019s global spokesperson and the only male model on the cover of Suyi in three years\u2026</p><br/><p>So many achievements!</p><br/><p>The members of the World Supermodels Organization were really blind!</p><br/><p>The sunspots were naturally happy and joking about Ming Yu, while Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were so sorrowful that they couldn\u2019t think. Only a few passersby fans were waiting for the so-called three way war between Celicia, He Chaoman and Du Ruo. They noticed something strange.</p><br/><p>\u3010 This time the list being delayed for one month is a bit strange. another strange thing is that this is the first time the rankings are published this way. It took 10 minutes between announcements for the 60th to 100th ranks. How did it become 30 minutes when it arrived at the 51st to 60th ranks? It looks like they are still meeting to discuss the rankings! \u3011</p><br/><p>It was really clear to the bystanders!</p><br/><p>Only the bystanders were surprised by the way the World Supermodels Organization published the rankings. The fans were only looking at the rankings of their models and didn\u2019t think too much. It wasn\u2019t until the 41st to 50th ranks weren\u2019t published for an hour that the fans noticed something was wrong!</p><br/><p>Just as they were feeling strange, all of a sudden! The announcement bar was updated!</p><br/><p>\u300e The world\u2019s male supermodel rankings:</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, Adenes Clark, Kelson Eddie, Luo Cheng, Harriman Owen\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Huicheng, Ming Yu, Mycroft Senler\u2026</p><br/><p>Fulake Eddie, George Mawson, Wei Zhang, Lee Sunjae, Kobayashi \u300f</p><br/><p>There was a long pause and now the rankings were updated all at once!</p><br/><p>This sudden announcement made everyone stunned and they couldn\u2019t respond for a while. Once they started seriously reading the list, they saw that the top of the men\u2019s list hadn\u2019t changed at all, just like people expected.</p><br/><p>The top five were exactly the same as last time, while the 11th to 20th ranks had small changes but it wasn\u2019t a big deal.</p><br/><p>21st to 30th was almost the same, 31st to 40th, ah, someone had advanced from above the 40th rank! 41st to 50th, there was no difference, except\u2026</p><br/><p>WTF!!!</p><br/><p>Who was 42nd?!!!</p><br/><p>The World Supermodels Organization only published a list of supermodel names but every name was a link. As long as you clicked on it, you can see the information page that the World Supermodels Organization had specifically made for them.</p><br/><p>Once the netizens clicked on the word \u2018Ming Yu\u2019, the first thing their eyes saw was the huge golden number:</p><br/><p>\u300e 42 \u300f</p><br/><p>Ming Yu (42).</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the age in brackets!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t even the debut time!</p><br/><p>This was the current supermodel ranking on the world supermodel rankings!!!</p><br/><p>For a time, the screaming sunspots became mute and stared dumbly at their screen. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were also amazed. They carefully read the name several times and looked at the huge \u201842\u2019. Then they became excited and rushed\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ahhhh, tears are already pouring down. Now I am going back to my stall, too bad QAQ \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I am being asked about why I am laughing while crying, about why I am shaking while typing! Ming Xiaoyu is really great! Becoming his fan is the most correct decision I have ever made in my life!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 T^T I am sobbing furiously! Why am I crying when Mushroom got such a good ranking? Why can\u2019t I stop crying? Why is Mushroom so good? Why is he so good? He is great!!! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The screen-like announcements appeared in the official forum of the World Supermodels Organization. For a time, even Xi Ze\u2019s fans were unable to control the excitement and pleasure of the mushroom fans. They madly expressed their joy in the forum. At the same time\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 Mushroom got the 42nd rank! All the previous lucky draw activities worked!! \u3011</p><br/><p>What was this? All the previous lucky draw activities\u2026</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that 32 lipsticks and makeup?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it 58 Dusha crystal mushroom necklaces?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it 10 sets of Nidelan\u2019s Smoke fragrances?!!!</p><br/><p>It was the 42nd rank, not 82 or 92!</p><br/><p>Even if people from Huaxia had money, cold they do this?</p><br/><p>Of course, the fans who started the lucky draw didn\u2019t think Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s ranking would be so high. Now their lucky draws were truly too expensive. It was thousands of yuan for them and they might only be able to eat pickles this month.</p><br/><p>Then many of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans said in unison: \u3010 These lucky draws are the group activity of mushroom fans. I am willing to sponsor XX money in order to support Mushroom\u2019s further growth! Let these ignorant foreigners know how united we are and about Ming Yu\u2019s strength! \u3011</p><br/><p>These words really stirred many people.</p><br/><p>The cohesiveness of the fans was too high! Whether it was the previous lucky draws or the current sponsorship, it was enough to make the Western fans stunned and no more ironic words could be said.</p><br/><p>Just as many people\u2019s eyes were focused on Ming Xiaoyu and his fans, the world\u2019s female supermodel rankings was suddenly announced!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t split into groups of 10 like the male supermodel rankings. The whole leaderboard was announced at once!</p><br/><p>\u300e The world\u2019s female supermodel rankings:</p><br/><p>Cecilia Cote, He Chaoman, Du Ruo, Anna Cartman\u2026 \u300f</p><br/><p>The top five didn\u2019t change at all apart from the fact that He Chaoman had surpassed Du Ruo and regained her original spot!</p><br/><p>Etc etc.</p><br/><p>There was no change in the male supermodel rankings and the female supermodel rankings were basically unchanged\u2026</p><br/><p>Then why exactly was it delayed one month?</p><br/><p>There was no supermodel whose position changed so much that the entire rankings\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait, this was wrong!</p><br/><p>There really was one!!!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the eyes of countless fashion lovers all over the world were focused on the words \u2018Ming Yu.\u2019 The glittering \u201842\u2019 stabbed at those who had been mocking Ming Yu. It seemed to slap them in the face, causing burning pain!</p><br/><p>They had just been ridiculing him and now their faces were so painful!</p><br/><p>Why did the male supermodel rankings need to be organized in groups of 10?</p><br/><p>It was because they were buying time while discussing Ming Yu\u2019s ranking.</p><br/><p>Why did they suddenly slow down and prolong the time for the 51st to 60th ranks?</p><br/><p>It was because they were fighting for time!</p><br/><p>Why did the publish the complete list after the 41st to 50th ranks?</p><br/><p>It was because in these rankings, only Ming Yu\u2019s position made the World Supermodels Organization unable to agree. Thus, they spent 1.5 hours\u2026no! It was actually a month and a half of careful discussion. Finally, Ming Yu got the 42nd rank!</p><br/><p>Two days ago, Andrew Wallen said that he would be the only new supermodel to break through and make it onto the world supermodel rankings.</p><br/><p>And now!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s name hung in the 42nd place! It was a miracle!</p><br/><p>And Andrew Wallen, not even a similar homophonic name could be found on the rankings!</p><br/><p>Then that evening, the famous Italian fashion gossip magazine \u2018Richard\u2019 suddenly published a recording on its official Twitter!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

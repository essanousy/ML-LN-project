Therefore, he was standing in front of Ming Xiaoyu and slightly bending down. Ming Xiaoyu was sitting in the chair to remove his makeup, so he was looking up at Luo Cheng from his chair.</p><br/><p>As a result, Luo Cheng had his back to the door and was leaning down slightly. Ming Xiaoyu was looking up while facing the door. However, it wasn\u2019t useful for Ming Xiaoyu to face the door! His body was completely blocked by the tall Luo Cheng!</p><br/><p>Why did he grow so high? Why so tall?</p><br/><p>If Luo Cheng was 169cm, Xi Ze could see clearly!</p><br/><p>Do you know what Mr. Xi was currently seeing? You still don\u2019t know? Then quickly watch an idol drama! \u201cI was just blowing sand out of her eyes, honey. You\u2019re misunderstanding\u201d to \u201cOur figures just overlapped when we were picking up things. Nothing happened.\u201d It was these types of scenarios.</p><br/><p>But although the author could write such a dog blood story, it was obviously impossible for Xi Ze to be the heroine of an idol drama who screamed angrily without listening. He swept his gaze over his lover\u2019s body before indifferently looking at Luo Cheng.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng, \u201c\u2026qaq\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it! Why was it so cold suddenly? Hey, I\u2019m going back to Antarctica!</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng unconsciously moved to one side and Xi Ze could finally see Ming Yu. Seeing his lover\u2019s surprised face, Xi Ze probably understood what was happening. He took a leisurely step inside and closed the door.</p><br/><p><em>Click.</em></p><br/><p>Luo Cheng couldn\u2019t stop his bad habit and started shaking.</p><br/><p>The handsome man paid no attention to the shaking Luo Cheng on the side as he headed straight to Ming Yu. Once he noticed the pattern on the youth\u2019s eyes, he raised a hand and gently stroked the complex and beautiful patterns.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t removed it yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu laughed. \u201cI was going to remove it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng on the side, \u201c\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze nodded. \u201cThis type of eyeliner is a bit difficult to remove. I will help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Xi Ze picked up a cotton pad on the table and the configured makeup remover. It was a smooth move, as if it was natural and there wasn\u2019t another person in the room.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s mouth slightly twitched and he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cXi Ze, Mr. Luo is still standing there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng was stunned when he heard this and hurriedly shook his head. \u2018No, no, no! I\u2019m not here! You are seeing incorrectly!!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze chose to listen to the youth. He laid down his cotton pad and looked at Luo Cheng like he was trying to make Luo Cheng\u2019s existence shrink. Then he made a surprised expression and asked, \u201cSince when were you here? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng laughed hollowly. \u201cI\u2019m here\u2026to deliver something.\u201d It was to look at a beauty and to eat tofu\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment that Xi Ze appeared, Luo Cheng noticed that something was strange.</p><br/><p>As it had been mentioned before, a supermodel who could climb to the top of the fashion circle must be filled with talent and strength. Secondly, they must have good opportunities. Finally, and the most important point, they couldn\u2019t be silly and sweet like Zhao Rui. (Zhao Rui: Hey!)</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng\u2019s nature wasn\u2019t on the level of Zhao Rui, but it wasn\u2019t far off. He wasn\u2019t scheming and as long as he determined the other person wasn\u2019t bad, he would be careless, honest and easy to get along with. This type of personality was different from Du Ruo, Xu Rongrong. Luo Cheng wasn\u2019t shrewd and cunning.</p><br/><p>Then why was Luo Cheng able to become a top supermodel?</p><br/><p>Well, because he was a rich second-generation son with a strong background\u2026</p><br/><p>But even though he grew up pampered and didn\u2019t pay attention to some things, Luo Ru knew one thing for certain. Xi Ze wouldn\u2019t come to the makeup room of a small model and even use such a casual tone when speaking to the model.</p><br/><p>It was true that this young model was beautiful, but Luo Cheng didn\u2019t believe it was enough to make Xi Ze fall.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng knew how many beautiful models and even beautiful teenagers wanted to climb into Xi Ze\u2019s bed. After all, as long as they got into Xi Ze\u2019s bed, it was a fast ticket to the summit. However, Luo Cheng knew that Xi Ze was a person with an extreme obsession with cleanliness. Don\u2019t talk about wanting to climb into his bed. If they dared to even casually touch it, haha\u2026Xi Ze might be polite on the surface, but he could destroy them in an instant!</p><br/><p>Now Xi Ze was talking to this model with such an attitude.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng\u2019s palms were covered with sweat. He could perceive that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s eyes narrowed at Luo Cheng\u2019s words and then he asked, \u201cHow long have you stayed in the United States without returning to Huaxia?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng was speechless and couldn\u2019t respond for a moment.</p><br/><p>However, the familiar words made Ming Xiaoyu think of something. Didn\u2019t Xi Ze say something similar to Zeng Shu? Then Xi Ze said\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been almost a year since I\u2019ve come back\u2026\u201d Luo Cheng paused and added, \u201cIn the middle, I came back once for Chinese New Year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze sighed heavily and shook his head. \u201cGo back to your agent and ask her about this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng was confused. \u201cEh, what will Sister Ya tell me? No, I\u2019m not going home yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow and asked quietly, \u201cYou aren\u2019t returning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng was startled. He gulped and nodded heavily, \u201cI won\u2019t return!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made a low \u2018oh\u2019 sound. Then he said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve already called Wen Ya. She should\u2019ve brough a ticket from the United States and also frozen your bank card.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>qaq\u2026What grudge did Xi Ze have against him?!!!</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng, who had long been frozen, felt deeply exhausted inside and out. Why? He had been independent for so many years. How could he still be scared when he saw this man! Why did he have to be bullied by Xi Ze?</p><br/><p>Was it because of Ming Yu?</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng\u2019s eyes widened in horror and he didn\u2019t dare look at the two people.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze also didn\u2019t look at him. He just instructed, \u201cClose the door when you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Luo Cheng who originally hadn\u2019t planned to leave headed for the door with a secret in his stomach. However, he had only walked halfway when he head Ming Yu say, \u201cHe is an outsider.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Xi Ze asked without hesitation, \u201cLuo Cheng, what did you see today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng\u2019s feet paused at the \u2018outsider\u2019 part.</p><br/><p>Then he opened the door with a smile and said, \u201cBrother Xi, I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Click. </em>A sound was heard and Luo Cheng really left the room.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu heard the sound of the door closing and sighed softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect for you to hide nothing in front of Luo Cheng. It isn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked down and carefully wiped the youth\u2019s eyes with the cotton pad. \u201cDo you know the name of Luo Cheng\u2019s agent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s lips curved as he answered, \u201cWen Ya, one of Muse\u2019s ace agents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe used to be my assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu jerked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Cheng was signed to Ding Bo who managed him for a year. Then he was handed over to Wen Ya.\u201d Xi Ze added, \u201cAt first, the relationship between me and Luo Cheng was still good. But after he reached his rebellious period, he didn\u2019t meet me much. However, it seems that his temper has been restrained lately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That foolish person just then, did he really have a rebellious period? Xi Ze\u2019s credibility really wasn\u2019t high!</p><br/><p>The two people spoke for a while. Then Ming Yu suddenly had a though. \u201cWait a minute, why did Luo Cheng suddenly not want to meet you? Did you do something horrible? You aren\u2019t bullying him, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s tone was calm. \u201cNo, am I the type who would bully children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you really did bully him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Xi Ze sighed. \u201cWhen he was still with Ding Bo, he once accidentally spilled a drink on me. I gently scolded him and now he doesn\u2019t meet me often.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was dumbfounded. \u201c\u2026Your gentle reprimand, it must be very mild.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled. \u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was praising you?</p><br/><p>After a while, Ming Yu\u2019s eye makeup was finally completely removed. He looked at his eyes in the mirror and confirmed there were no problems, then he laughed. \u201cIt was the first time I wore this type of makeup. I didn\u2019t think it would be so difficult to remove. Fortunately, you came here today, or I really would\u2019ve had to trouble Luo Cheng.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xi Ze noticed something and raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t a makeup artist help you remove it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu originally wanted to answer, \u2018Luo Cheng said the makeup artist had something to do.\u2019 However, he hadn\u2019t spoken it yet when he realized something was wrong. He sighed and said, \u201cI was careless. Luo Cheng probably called the makeup artist away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips thinned at the words. \u201cIt was Luo Cheng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thought about the stupid man\u2019s bullied appearance and shrugged. He didn\u2019t do anything to help as he said, \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s eyes narrowed. He already had an idea in his head. On the other hand, Ming Xiaoyu saw his expression and seemed to see a miserable future for Luo Cheng. But Small Mushroom, if you do something bad, you will receive retribution for it sooner or later!</p><br/><p>For example\u2026</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was imagining how Luo Cheng would be punished for his actions. However, Xi Ze grabbed his waist and suddenly kissed the corner of the surprised Ming Yu\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s eyes drooped. \u201cDo you intend to use someone else\u2019s knife to do your dirty work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu replied calmly, \u201cOh, that is what you are saying, not me. Mr. Xi, would you like to be my knife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t answer at once. His dark eyes were fixed on the youth\u2019s bright smile. Then his lips curved and he said, \u201cThis looks good. I like it. It is cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze then kissed the youth\u2019s lips, blocking the words \u201cWho is cute?\u201d The lips and tongue moved rhythmically as an ambiguous atmosphere spread through the quiet dressing room. The man plundered the youth\u2019s mouth and the youth didn\u2019t withdraw, firmly sucking on the other person.</p><br/><p>In the end, the cute small mushroom pressed the man against the wall and Xi Ze jerked. After the initial reaction, he pushed back against the rebellious small mushroom.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the two people tidied up their messy clothes and left the dressing room. They had only taken a few steps before they met Zhao Rui and Luo Ru.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

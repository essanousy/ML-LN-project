At they same time, they fired the people responsible for these reports.</p><br/><p>On the surface, this incident seemed to be caused by Xi Ze\u2019s private talks with the head of the US branch of New Corporation, the group behind the Sun. But in fact, before entering the building, chief editor Song Chuci of Muse has contacted public opinion circles in Huaxia and placed pressure on News Corps.</p><br/><p>Huaxia media hadn\u2019t disputed with Western media for a long time. Now that this peace was temporarily broken, it was subject to cross-border punishment.</p><br/><p>After the Sun, many small newspapers that supported the Sun also issued an apology statement.</p><br/><p>This time, apart from Mudley pretending to be dead, everything seemed to have been solved. Mudley\u2019s company shamelessly said that she was \u2018unwell\u2019 and the Huaxia netizens gradually subsided, not thinking too much about it.</p><br/><p>But as the Sun and other newspapers apologized, a video appeared on major video sites around the world. It soon got millions of forwards and got many hits!</p><br/><p>In the video, a beautiful woman was looking gracefully at the camera and spoke words of apology with no sincerity. Like it was mentioned before, Mudley\u2019s acting skills were decent. That\u2019s how she could compete against the talented people of Hollywood with her arrogant personality.</p><br/><p>Thus, everyone saw Mudley\u2019s proud appearance in the video and became furious. Even her loyal and brainless fans were angry. Mudley didn\u2019t show the slightest bit of remorse. What was this apology letter?</p><br/><p>What did she mean by \u2018I spoke accidentally. For a moment, I forgot what happened that night. I didn\u2019t expect the Sun to be so serious. It really had nothing to do with me. I\u2019m sorry, I will pay attention to my words and deeds. I won\u2019t be caught by a villain and I\u2019m really sorry to Ming Yu\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>What the hell was she talking about?</p><br/><p>Why did she seem like an arrogant person blaming others when she was apologizing?!!!</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t she have any shame?</p><br/><p>The rage of the fans skyrocketed. This video was recorded by Ding Bo but he really didn\u2019t expect Mudley to pass it all at once, without the slightest mistake.</p><br/><p>This made Ding Bo think as he ordered his people to pack up the cameras. Then he smiled and said, \u201cMudley, in fact, aren\u2019t your thoughts exactly the same as this apology?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudley\u2019s expression changed the moment she heard these words. She covered it up quickly but she couldn\u2019t hide from Ding Bo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Mudley\u2019s eyes were very red and sorrowful as she cried out, \u201cSir, I really know what I did wrong. It won\u2019t happen again. Can you let me leave now\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudley wasn\u2019t stupid enough to admit to Ding Bo\u2019s words but her appearance didn\u2019t make Ding Bo feel any sympathy. Thus, the day that the apology video came out, Mudley\u2019s agent no longer restricted her freedom. The moment she left, Mudley first called little Allen.</p><br/><p>Mudley thought that she had a good relationship with Allen. Allen was the grandson of her company\u2019s boss and would definitely help her through this difficult time. She really accompanied little Allen to a few parties and knew some big people. She certainly wouldn\u2019t be abandoned.</p><br/><p>But what surprised Mudley was that when she called, she was directly cut off!</p><br/><p>Wait until she tried it again! She got the notification that her number had been blocked!</p><br/><p>Mudley panicked and rushed to the company. At this time of the day, Allen was sure to be in his office at the company. Mudley entered the company wearing sunglasses and a hat. But all the disgusted gazes at the sight of her made her feel shocked and confused.</p><br/><p>She went up to find little Allen, only to be turned away by the other party\u2019s assistance.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Mudley heard other small stars and staff of the company whispering to each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god, doesn\u2019t Mudley have AIDS? Why would she come to the company? This is terrible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Mudley\u2019s body is too good. She was too sexy in those photos!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god, aren\u2019t you afraid of getting AIDS? I don\u2019t know how many times this woman and the director who died last year participated in the group parties. It is terrible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>These sentences struck Mudley like hail.</p><br/><p>She kept hypnotizing herself. It was impossible, these things were only known by little Allen, it was impossible\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, she remembered that in order to win the female no. 2 role, she took the initiative to hook Allen. Under his instructions, she was introduced to a big director and many third-tier stars. She participated in a full half a month of disorderly sex in a villa.</p><br/><p>In the following years, she indulged in these promiscuous activities and couldn\u2019t extricate herself. It was really easy to meet her own physiological needs and to get rewards from the directors and producers.</p><br/><p>Then the director died of AIDS two years later. She was afraid to check her body. Once the test showed she didn\u2019t get AIDS, Mudley was greatly relieved.</p><br/><p>These things couldn\u2019t be exposed! Only little Allen had some photos and he wouldn\u2019t betray her\u2026</p><br/><p>Mudley\u2019s footsteps suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>She had a sudden thought as Allen\u2019s assistant stopped her outside the door.</p><br/><p>Mudley was frozen for a minute. Then she hurriedly went on the Internet and started searching up information on herself. Once she saw the \u2018drug abuse\u2019, \u2018bullying newcomers\u2019, \u2018unspoken rules with directors and producers\u2019 and even information about the sex parties, Mudley collapsed to the ground and cried!</p><br/><p>She was ruined!</p><br/><p>Really ruined!</p><br/><p>Once these things came out, the rest of her life was ruined!</p><br/><p>Mudley was in agony for half an hour before finally leaving the company. Many reporters had heard she was here and blocked the way outside the door. Mudley finally broke through the encirclement and returned home. But at the door, she saw a familiar person.</p><br/><p>The bodyguard who stabbed the knife near her finger looked at her coldly as he said, \u201cMr. Ding said that he would help you restore your original appearance. Miss. Mudley, please cooperate. The doctors at the nearby plastic surgery hospital are ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Now that this matter was finished, Xi Ze and Ding Bo flew back to London to go to the fashion show.</p><br/><p>On the distant Huaxia mainland, Ming Yy looked at the disgusting mosaic photos and sighed helplessly. He finally looked at the videos of Mudley being interviewed by some reporters this morning and shut down the computer.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s brow was slightly furrowed as he looked at the distant horizon. He seemed to notice that something was wrong. But after pondering a moment, he dismissed it and didn\u2019t think much of it anymore.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was reluctant to pick up his phone but Ming Yu knew these things must be done by him.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was a person who was \u2018always dripping with grace in the spring phase, but will repay the enemy\u2019s sword 10 times.\u2019 At this point, Ming Yu had the same principle. Only he didn\u2019t think that so much needed to be done.</p><br/><p>In any case, Xi Ze always did things consistently.</p><br/><p>After the last incident with Jiang Kaiyang, Ming Xiaoyu once tried to persuade him to give the other person a chance to live in the future. Xi Ze was silent for a moment before telling the story of his sister.</p><br/><p>When Xi Ze was four years old, he had a sister who was older by three years.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s little uncle was kidnapped when he was five years old. It caused a sensation in his family and all of Huaxia. After that, his uncle was naturally rescued and wasn\u2019t injured at all. One kidnapper was killed on the spot while the other received life imprisonment.</p><br/><p>However, when Xi Ze was four years old and his sister was seven years old, the kidnapper who kidnapped his uncle was released from prison.</p><br/><p>The Xi family never expected that the kidnapper would return decades later. The kidnapper didn\u2019t care about his own life and was even determined to die. After being released from prison, he tied a bomb to him and detonated it just as Xi Ze\u2019s sister was leaving school.</p><br/><p>Once the police searched the man\u2019s rental house, they found this sentence in the diary: I will use this life to kill the people in your family! My big brother was killed by you! My leg is lame and I have been in prison for 20 years! I am dead but I want to grab the lives of your family members as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>No amount of anger could save a person\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>XI Ze\u2019s uncle was filled with guilt once he knew this. But this incident had nothing to do with him. It wasn\u2019t that he killed his niece. It was the ignorant kidnapper\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>After that, the Xi family\u2019s education always stated: don\u2019t leave anybody behind.</p><br/><p>In the hearts of the family members, the lives of their family were always the most important. In any case, they must consider themselves and then consider others.</p><br/><p>Of course, it seemed that life was very calm now and Xi Ze was standing at the peak of the fashion industry, no one could threaten him. But he always followed his elder\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>After telling the story, Xi Ze said to his lover, \u201cI\u2019m not a good or kind person.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s response was a gentle kiss and low laugh. \u201cWho said that I am a good person?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Xi Ze\u2019s surprised look, Ming Xiaoyu acted out the slave and master, pressing the man under his body. He said with a smile, \u201cSince we aren\u2019t good people, we will sell our own products internally in order to not harm the public. Well\u2026 this evildoer, quickly show your original appearance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow and rolled the youth under him. \u201cI am an evildoer? Then you are a little goblin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you are too overbearing. Haven\u2019t you read novels when you are a child? Who is a goblin\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, there were some embarrassing things. There was no need to say any more. These two people weren\u2019t ashamed and the readers should be used to it.</p><br/><p>This meant that Ming Xiaoyu felt Xi Ze was too ruthless this time. However, he didn\u2019t do anything to stop it.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a holy person. The exposed black materials weren\u2019t fake. He didn\u2019t have to pour dirty water on Mudley. These were all things Mudley had done in the past and Xi Ze just made them public.</p><br/><p>Since it was only clarifying the truth, did Xi Ze make a mistake?</p><br/><p>Of course not.</p><br/><p>In this regard, the storm caused by the Sun and Mudley Joyce that swept over the world came to an end. This was the last bit of attention paid to the 2017 RAmer Charity Gala. A week later, some people were surprised to see a woman on the street who looked very similar to Mudley.</p><br/><p>This woman didn\u2019t have Mudley\u2019s sharp chin or her rounded chest. She looked 70% similar to Mudley. She was slightly less beautiful but would still stand out in a crowd.</p><br/><p>After being blocked, Mudley Joyce\u2019s name really disappeared from the memories of the public.</p><br/><p>She threatened to \u2018never participate in the RAmer Charity Gala again.\u2019 Now she became a joke and no one mentioned her again. At most, when they were chatting with friends over a meal, one person said, \u201cI see a star try to deal a big kick only for her to explode, haha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Three days later, Ming Yu left for Hong Kong in order to be a global spokesperson for a big international brand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

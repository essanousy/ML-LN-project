Now he\u2026 well, she had become the world\u2019s first supermodel. She was really proud and full of strength.</p><br/><p>Of course, some people asked if Adenes\u2019 dream was to top the world\u2019s supermodel rankings?</p><br/><p>To this, Adenes generously replied that she just felt like a woman. She loved a woman\u2019s beauty from an early age. This beauty made him very obsessed and to also think that they were the creations God selflessly dedicated himself to.</p><br/><p>In the end, it could be summed up in one sentence.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Adenes Clark: I like women. Anyone who is unconvinced can bite me. \u3011</p><br/><p>Despite Adenes saying that he hated Xi Ze on his twitter, his fans just laughed and said nothing. Even Xi Ze\u2019s fans just laughed and didn\u2019t show much reaction.</p><br/><p>Losing to Xi Ze for five years!</p><br/><p>It was normal for a person to feel envious and some hate.</p><br/><p>In addition, Xi Ze was a bad person! How long had it been since he had walked in a show?</p><br/><p>Ji and Ya hadn\u2019t created a men\u2019s high-end show for two consecutive years and Xi Ze hadn\u2019t participated in any fashion shows. He was completely regarded as \u2018a sightseeing supermodel.\u2019</p><br/><p>As this thought sprung up in the minds of many people, they weren\u2019t aware that in May, Ji and Ya would post a notice saying that this July\u2019s Ji and Ya should would target men\u2019s clothing.</p><br/><p>Many male supermodel fans around the world were stirred as soon as they saw this announcement.</p><br/><p>Ji and Ya hadn\u2019t released a menswear show in two years. This occasion naturally filled them with enthusiasm. The high-end work was kept at a low profile for two years. This high-end show would definitely be very beautiful. The people who could walk in this high-end should would naturally receive glory and would have their supermodel ranking in June affected.</p><br/><p>It was because the high-end show took place in July but the list of invited supermodels would be released in May.</p><br/><p>A high-end show would have dozens of people walk in the show and wouldn\u2019t exceed 100. Ji and Ya\u2019s requirements for their fashion shows were extremely high. They would rather have a supermodel walk two times then a non-qualified model appear.</p><br/><p>Many people started to feel pity for Adenes. After all, it was likely that he would\u2019ve become Ji and Ya\u2019s finale model if he hadn\u2019t changed sex.</p><br/><p>Many people started to speculate about who would appear on the stage of this Ji and Ya fashion show.</p><br/><p>Among the catwalk models, Ming Yu\u2019s name was most popular!</p><br/><p>It was because Xi Ze and Ming Yu\u2019s relationship was really intimate! Everyone knew that Xi Ze was a person who didn\u2019t like to post on Weibo. But in order to be loved by his lover, in the short amount of time since the relationship was announced, Xi Ze put on a big show.</p><br/><p>It was as if he was anxious to let the world know\u2014 This mushroom is mine!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xi Ze: I just woke up. What is the weather like in London today @Ming Yu \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xi Ze: Yesterday\u2019s show is very good, the high-end piece was very good @Raymond\u2019s innovation is amazing @Ming Yu\u2019s interpretation is also very suitable. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xi Ze: Today I encountered a Yizhi posted on the road. This person is somewhat familiar @Ming Yu [/Photo] \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The Weibo posts caused the fans to feel ecstatic and angry.</p><br/><p>They were ecstatic since God Xi used to go for half a month without posting and now the daily messages were like a punch! However, the anger from every person on the Weibo was the love show!! \uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b!!!</p><br/><p>Did single dogs not feel bitter? They are bitter!</p><br/><p>Did single dogs not feel tired?</p><br/><p>They are tired!</p><br/><p>Their husband was taken away and now he showed love every day? If it was sprinkling sugar once or twice, they could say that it was \u2018good and sweet\u2019 and \u2018we have to eat dog food again\u2019. But what if the dog food was scattered everywhere?</p><br/><p>A pack of dog food in the morning, dog food at noon and dog food in the evening! Sometimes another goodnight dog food would be sent!</p><br/><p>This speed of dog food production really made all the CP fans bow before him!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the single dogs were killed by him!</p><br/><p>If Xi Ze\u2019s fans were blinded by their own god, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were in dire straight and unable to escape!</p><br/><p>God Xi\u2019s show of mushroom love also affected them. Didn\u2019t Xi Ze post a sneak shot of the sleeping Ming Xiaoyu a few days ago?</p><br/><p>This photo was really beautiful. The golden sun shone on the white face, showing of small mushroom\u2019s long eyelashes, tall nose, red lips and collarbone that wasn\u2019t completely covered by a blanket\u2026</p><br/><p>No, a nosebleed was coming out!!</p><br/><p>Cough, returning to the main topic, the mushroom fans had their own family cooked in a public display of affection. At the same time. The leader of their fan circle, Zyu! He also showed love every day!!!</p><br/><p>In the past, God Zyu didn\u2019t speak much. He would use his Weibo and write posts in the fan forum, but he never spoke a work of nonsense. If he posted a photo, he would only explain what it was and not express himself any more.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 QAQ!</p><br/><p>It changed since God Z and Good Legs Sister hooked up! God Z wasn\u2019t the noble and cold self of the past!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: I haven\u2019t seen you in three days. I miss you eyes, I miss your eyebrows, I miss your eyelashes, I miss your lips\u2026 I miss you and also miss you long legs @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: Change your name. I am now counted as your \u2018wife\u2019 and you want to break my legs every day. What is this? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: Well, you don\u2019t have to change it but I will only allow you to break my other leg. Well, grabbing it is better. \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Damn it! Even using obscene words! Doesn\u2019t he care about his face?</p><br/><p>God Xi \u2018s show of love belonged to the 24/7 filial boyfriend, his wife always filling his heart. Then God Zyu\u2019s show of love was to use a sexual tone with Good Legs Sister!</p><br/><p>A storm of sexual words! The onlookers wondered why they had to be swept in?</p><br/><p>However, since the actual person was so shameless, many sexual-words expert started to appear on Zyu\u2019s Weibo. These enthusiastic friends had just replied to Zyu\u2019s Weibo when they received the following message.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: Who told you that @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg is a woman? \u3011 The words woke up the dreamers!</p><br/><p>All the fans were shocked and the small mushroom in their hands fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>After God Z\u2019s clarification, the comments under his post weren\u2019t reduced! The number of fans also skyrocketed after previously losing thousands of followers. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s side Weibo also reached 100,000 in just a few days.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Come, there is a shameless person here abusing a dog! @ Protect Single Dogs Association \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Is there an amazing boyfriend? [/doge] \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I can\u2019t eat this dog food! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 It is just a boyfriend! I don\u2019t have a boyfriend but I have to watch this love show! Hmph! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>While Xi Ze was doing this things, Ming Yu was having a discussion with Xiao Biqing who he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time. The two sides were in a meeting and it was very late in the evening. Then Zyu posted his \u2018clarifying gender\u2019 Weubo and there were thousands of forwards and comments!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think that this level was very bad. You must know that Zyu\u2019s identity was only Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s lead fan. He didn\u2019t have Xiao Biqing\u2019s actress halo so it was already quite frightening that he could have this type of exposure.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s face became livid when he saw this Weibo.</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing also saw the news and shook her fists with indignation, crying out, \u201cThis Zyu is too much! He robbed me of my identity as lead mushroom fan! Fortunately, I know you in reality and know we have a closer relationship. Otherwise, as a mushroom fan, I would really be jealous to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu who knew the truth, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how she would feel if he told her that they were sleeping on the same bed this morning _ (: \u0417\u201d\u2220) _</p><br/><p>After saying farewell to Xiao Biqing, the first thing Ming Xiaoyu did was to forward the Weibo angrily.</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: Grab peat! I\u2019m going to break your legs!!! All three legs will be broken @Zyu \u3011</p><br/><p>Then Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t pay much attention to this matter. He discussed a bit with Zhao Rui and Luo Ru before forwarding Xiao Biqing\u2019s Weibo and posting a message.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Yu: I am very happy to be working with @Xiao Biqing on @Midnight Singing. This time, you really are my sister. [/Laugh] \u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

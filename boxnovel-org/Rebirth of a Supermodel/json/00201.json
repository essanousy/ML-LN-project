Xi Ze\u2019s fans who had been silent for a few hours weren\u2019t happy!</p><br/><p>\u3010 What does this mean? Are you saying that my god opened the back door and accepted the unspoken rules, encouraging a bad atmosphere in the industry? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I am laughing. My god isn\u2019t a person to help newcomers behind the scenes! Do you know the world\u2019s second ranked female supermodel. He Chaoman? God Xi held her up! Do you know the world\u2019s fourth ranked male supermodel, Luo Cheng? God Xi held him up! If God Xi really accepted the unspoken rules, why didn\u2019t he directly make Ming Yu popular instead of quietly going through the back door? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 That\u2019s right! Ming Yu took so long to reach the 16th rank. The speed of his progress after becoming a supermodel is much faster than Luo Cheng. However, Luo Cheng appeared on the world supermodels list four months after debuting! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 You want to pour dirty water at this level? If Xi Ze is accepting the unspoken rules with Ming Yu, why isn\u2019t there a relationship between Ming Yu and Ji and Ya? This IQ is really low. \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>How angry were they?</p><br/><p>Their God Xi/ Small Mushroom stopped being single today, they lost love twice! Yet this person said that it wasn\u2019t true love between Mushroom and God Xi, it was the unspoken rules?</p><br/><p>Damn, slam this person!</p><br/><p>This was really \u2018opening the mouth to speak empty words\u2019! This evidence could only deceive outsiders and passersby who didn\u2019t know the truth. If Xi Ze really wanted to open the back door for Ming Yu, the first thing was to arrange for Ming Yu to walk in a Ji and Ya high-end fashion show?</p><br/><p>Cough, Ji and Ya hasn\u2019t had a men\u2019s fashion show for a long time?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t a problem!</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t He Chaoman walk in a Ji and Ya high-end men\u2019s clothing fashion show once? What was wrong with letting Ming Xiaoyu wear female clothing?</p><br/><p>A few days ago, the world\u2019s second ranked male\u2026 well, he wasn\u2019t a male supermodel anymore. The top male supermodel Adenes underwent a sex-change surgery and officially became a female supermodel.</p><br/><p>Who said that men can\u2019t walk in women\u2019s high-end fashion shows?</p><br/><p>As long as Xi Ze was willing! No one would dare to stop Ming Yu from walking in a women\u2019s high-end fashion show!</p><br/><p>But this incident was strange. Apart from Ming Yu and Xi Ze\u2019s original sunspots who helped out the po master called \u2018Rising Supermodel is Gay\u2019, unexpectedly, no other passersby helped him out.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze and Ming Yu\u2019s fans were already battle-hardened. This po master should be an authentic sunspot. After releasing the so-called black materials, he should immediately contact a major marketing company to buy a water army. He stirred up such muddy water, how could no one help him?</p><br/><p>Was this guy really not a sunspot?</p><br/><p>The fans were a bit confused. This guy didn\u2019t have a water army. Therefore, once Ming Xiaoyu and Xi Ze\u2019s fans poured out their scolding words, the field was instantly controlled!</p><br/><p>A person with black materials was actually controlled by fans?</p><br/><p>It seemed a bit strange\u2026</p><br/><p>The fans naturally didn\u2019t know that the po master had found a familiar marketing number in order to buy a water army. However, most of the marketing numbers became listless the moment they heard \u2018Xi Ze\u2019s unspoken rules with Ming Yu\u2019. The head of the water armies also said they wouldn\u2019t accept this job.</p><br/><p>However, there must be a brave money under all this money. One or two marketing numbers and water armies would be willing to do this. The po master was full of confidence as he released the black materials and waited a few hours. However, these marketing companies actually refused to move. They even refused to respond to his phone call.</p><br/><p>In a dimly lit apartment in the capital, Cheng Su and assistant Xiao An were sweating. They were flustered and didn\u2019t know how to proceed next.</p><br/><p>They naturally didn\u2019t know that at this moment, most of the lights in the Muse PR department was on despite it being night. All the personnel were on the job, madly calling and contacting various networks.</p><br/><p>In Cheng Su\u2019s heart, he really didn\u2019t believe that Xi Ze and Ming Yu were in a relationship.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su previously inadvertently heard from Zeng Shu and discovered that Xi Ze\u2019s family had a high background. Once he learned about it, he really became shocked and understood why no one in the industry dared provoke Xi Ze. Even if it was an unintended provocation, there would be no good end for that person.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su became calmer after finishing out Xi Ze\u2019s background.</p><br/><p>How could Xi Ze\u2019s family allow him to be a homosexual? This definitely wasn\u2019t possible! Homosexuality was disgusting and was completely contrary to Xi Ze\u2019s family\u2019s appearance. It was psychologically distorted and sick!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu must\u2019ve secretly seduced Xi Ze and Xi Ze was bored enough to play with this small model.</p><br/><p>It was clear that Xi Ze didn\u2019t care much for Ming Yu. Otherwise, as the fans said, Xi Ze could quickly raise Ming Yu instead of him taking one and a half years to reach the 16th rank.</p><br/><p>As long as he exposed this matter, Xi Ze would abandon the small model as soon as his image became damaged.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s only regret was that he only had these photos as evidence. He used to hire a private investigator to follow Ming Yu but the other person always gave him photos that were useless.</p><br/><p>Previous,y Cheng Su thought that Ming Yu was well guarded and no mistakes could be caught. But one time, his assistant Xiao An was walking down the street and unexpectedly saw Ming Yu and Xi Ze kissing in the car!</p><br/><p>What Cheng Su said was half true and half false.</p><br/><p>Assistant Xiao An\u2019s eyesight was very good and he could see the two people in the car despite the dark lighting. At that time, Ming Yu was moved by some of Xi Ze\u2019s past experiences and was kissing Xi Ze passionately in the car.</p><br/><p>Xiao An was smart and took some photos. Cheng Su also discovered that the private detective wasn\u2019t doing any work at all! Therefore, he had his assistant pay attention to Ming Yu and Xi Ze\u2019s movements. Sure enough! Xiao An caught the scene of the two men walking in the park.</p><br/><p>In the past, Cheng Su endured it and continued to find evidence of Ming Yu\u2019s \u2018unspoken rules\u2019.</p><br/><p>But now he was forced to have no jobs for two consecutive months. Cheng Su knew that if this continued, his fame would get worse and he would be directly forgotten by fans!</p><br/><p>This was his last stand, a desperate bet!</p><br/><p>It obviously had a good beginning but the next development wasn\u2019t under Cheng Su\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>Muse\u2019s PR department.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang frowned as he looked down at the information downloaded from the Internet. He asked, \u201cLinda, how is your side? Have you asked about the other person\u2019s identity from the marketing companies?\u201d</p><br/><p>Linda\u2019s face was gloomy as she quickly replied. \u201cNot yet. Some rules still need to be abided by. My men will take a bit longer to get the person\u2019s information. But many of these things are only known inside Muse. There is a 80% possibility that the person who broke the news is from inside the company.\u201d</p><br/><p>The beautiful deputy director sneered as she thought this. \u201cIn that long Weibo post, there are one or two things that only our PR department would know. It is highly likely that there is a mole in our department.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang thought for a moment before finally saying, \u201cSuppress this first before we catch the mole.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After such a thing happened, Ming Yu didn\u2019t leave the company that day and was stuck with Zhao Rui.</p><br/><p>The unspoken rules part hadn\u2019t been proven but this photos showed that Ming Yu and Xi Ze really had a relationship. Now a group of reporters were blocking the downstairs area of the company, waiting to be the first to get an interview.</p><br/><p>As a result, they were divided in two areas. Xi Ze was now trapped in the Ji and Ya building while Ming Yu was trapped in the Muse building.</p><br/><p>In this case, the two parties involved didn\u2019t speak first. They waited to see the reaction of the fans before doing anything. There were a set of options assuming that the fans were supportive and other options assuming that the fans left in large quantities. Otherwise, one wrong step might lead to irreversible consequences and a terrible loss.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ming Xiaoyu was still silent but someone helped him speak.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xiao Biqing: In any case, I like @Ming Yu, I believe in @Ming Yu, I support @Ming Yu! \u3011</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing was a deadly loyal Ming Yu fan. It was very normal for her to say such things. There were also many fans behind the movie queen. Therefore, many Xiao Biqing fans supported their goddess in supporting Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>Soon after Xiao Biqing, other people started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Fang Liangxiu: @Xi Ze and @Ming Yu are my friends, they are very trustworthy people. I didn\u2019t know anything before today but I believe that @Ming Yu isn\u2019t a villain who would walk through the back door. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Fei Sixin: Who is @Ming Yu? Wouldn\u2019t I know? If he was willing to accept the unspoken rules, I would be the first to sign up! Cough, I\u2019m just joking. My Ming Xiaoyu isn\u2019t that type of person. Don\u2019t push the dirty things about the industry onto my Ming Xiaoyu! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xu Yizong: You are actually a pair\u2026 I bless both of you @Ming Yu @Xi Ze. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Alice of Ji and Ya: How can someone be so malicious to speculate about others? The relationship between Mr. Xi and Ming Yu is really good. I know that I should speak here but I won\u2019t allow you to slander Mr. Xi and Ming Yu! \u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Their highest record was on month late!</p><br/><p>Compared to this one month record, being one day late was really nothing.</p><br/><p>This was acceptable to everyone so no one urged the World Supermodels Organization to release it.</p><br/><p>But the next day, the third day, the fourth day, the fifth day\u2026 one week passed!</p><br/><p>It had been a week! Why was the organization acting constipated? They should release it!! What were they doing?</p><br/><p>Gradually, fashion enthusiasts started to go and post messages on the World Supermodels Organization\u2019s official website. More and more messages appeared urging the release of the rankings. Once it was September 20th, the hiding World Supermodels Organization seemed to unwillingly announce the rankings.</p><br/><p>\u300e The world\u2019s female supermodel rankings:</p><br/><p>Cecilia Cote, Adenes Clark, He Chaoman, Du Ruo\u2026 \u300f</p><br/><p>Ah, Adenes moved forward again. Then the male supermodel rankings\u2014</p><br/><p>\u300e The world\u2019s male supermodel rankings:</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, Ming Yu, Kelson Eddie, Luo Cheng, Harriman Owen\u2026 \u300f</p><br/><p>Global fashion lovers, \u2018\u2026My pants are off, why are you showing me this?\u2019 \uff08/= \uff3f =\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534!!!</p><br/><p>There were some changes. For example, a Brazilian male model entered the top 30 on the men\u2019s list while a Korean female model entered the top 20 on the women\u2019s list. These changes seemed important but in the eyes of most fashion lovers, it wasn\u2019t worth the World Supermodels Organization delaying for 20 days.</p><br/><p>Please understand that in general, after the release of the world supermodels list, the relevant people in the World Supermodels Organization would start to recalculate the scores for each supermodel.</p><br/><p>It was possible for a supermodel to do something significant that would change their points before the rankings was announced, but this would only delay the World Supermodels Organization a little bit.</p><br/><p>The real rankings were usually decided at the end of the last month. The reason why the publication date wasn\u2019t set and was generally marked as the early parts of the month was to carefully calculate the points of every person to avoid any incidents.</p><br/><p>However, the most difficult points to calculate were clearly the 10 or 20 people at the top of the rankings.</p><br/><p>Now the top 10 for both lists hadn\u2019t changed except for Adenes. It was just a small change and could the announcement be delayed for 20 days because of this?</p><br/><p>\u3010 I think that it is a bit strange. Cecilia, Adenes and He Chaoman, it is estimated that these three people have similar points. But in the past, the release of the rankings list wasn\u2019t delayed despite the rankings changing. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Yes, their rankings changed but the list was always published on time. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I feel that this time there wasn\u2019t any changes but has the implementation of the points changed? Perhaps the members of the World Supermodels Organization are confused and don\u2019t know how to deal with the rankings? \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This was three ignorant cobblers adding up to a genius (collective wisdom exceeds an individual).</p><br/><p>Most people didn\u2019t know the specific formula that the World Supermodels Organization used to calculate points but they knew that this formula was definitely related to the performance of the supermodels.</p><br/><p>The first reference element was probably the number of endorsements, the quality of the endorsements and the brand specifications of the endorsements. The second was the fashion shows of the supermodels and their performance in the fashion shows. The third was the supermodel\u2019s achievements in other areas, such as entertainment and philanthropy, where their estimated contributions could be used as a reference. The fourth was presumably the supermodel\u2019s influence in global media.</p><br/><p>There were many factors added up so the variability was very big. But looking at today\u2019s barely changed rankings, people couldn\u2019t help wondering who forced the World Supermodels Organization to delay it by 20 days.</p><br/><p>After the announcement of the rankings, reporters naturally interviewed relevant members of the World Supermodels Organization. However, this time the members were secretive and didn\u2019t answer the reporters\u2019 questions. In the face of \u2018Why is this rankings list later, is it related to the rankings of a specific supermodel?\u2019, their expressions would immediately change and they would quickly leave.</p><br/><p>The answer seemed to be locked in an endless fog. The people who knew didn\u2019t reveal the truth and those who didn\u2019t know were confused.</p><br/><p>But some people like Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans jokingly speculated. When they chatted on the forum, they casually laughed and said: \u3010 Remember how the previous rankings delay was related to mushroom? Perhaps this time is because of mushroom? \u3011</p><br/><p>Do you know what sunspots were like? They were fond of seizing the loopholes in any words, zooming in on it 10,000 times and ridiculing it!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Haha, how funny. Isn\u2019t the face of a fan really big? Your god is going to heaven! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Your god is already in heaven, don\u2019t read. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 The world\u2019s supermodel rankings are changed because of me! \u2014A famous saying. \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>These mocking words made Xiaoyu\u2019s fans angry. They were just joking and only said one word about this matter. Yet the sunspots gathered and splashed dirty water on them.</p><br/><p>This was simply pushing the fans!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Members of the World Supermodels Organization have admitted that the previous delays were due to Ming Xiaoyu. But this time we didn\u2019t say it was because of mushroom. Don\u2019t pin that label on us! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I was laughing when I saw the sunspots\u2019 words with my own eyes. If we want to go to heaven then what about your god? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 The sunspots are probably people with intellectual disabilities. Their brains are very cheerful and <span class=\"skimlinks-unlinked\">indifferent.jpg</span> \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The small provocation of sunspots was already commonplace for Ming Yu\u2019s fans. They were adept at handling these sunspots and then returning to the previous topic. For example, recently God Z hadn\u2019t been around for a long time and when he was, he showed love to the Good Legs brother all day. For example, Small Mushroom and God Xi have been showing all types of live and their dog food wasn\u2019t eaten.</p><br/><p>They chatted and chatted and October soon arrived.</p><br/><p>After the storm of the previous rankings, the hundreds of members were reluctant to be interviewed, When a discouraged reporter found a Ji and Ya member of the World Supermodels Organization, the member unexpectedly said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was originally thinking about asking perfunctory things. Once he heard this, he was stunned as he quickly understood. He asked, \u201cThis time the world supermodel rankings were delayed, isn\u2019t it because a supermodel\u2019s points has undergone great changes?\u201d</p><br/><p>This member\u2019s answer was:</p><br/><p>It\u2014should\u2014be!</p><br/><p>Yes! It wasn\u2019t \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019, \u2018I have no right to tell you\u2019 or \u2018can\u2019t you guess?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was \u2018It should be!\u2019</p><br/><p>The reporter immediately asked quickly, \u201cCan you tell me if the big change in points is due to Adenes making progress? Did Adenes and Cecilia have a big leap in their points?\u201d</p><br/><p>The member smiled and shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a question of the women\u2019s list, it is the men\u2019s list.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words made the reporter stunned!</p><br/><p>After that, the reporter asked about the men\u2019s list but the member was tight-lipped and didn\u2019t talk anymore. Once the reporter rushed back to prepare the article, he didn\u2019t know that the member made a phone call.</p><br/><p>The telephone was quickly connected and a low and magnetic voice was heard.</p><br/><p>The member said very solemnly, \u201cMr. Xi, I have revealed the things I was allowed to disclose. You should be able to guess what happened this time. Due to the regulations of the organization, I can\u2019t tell you everything but I think you should be more active.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze replied to him in a calm voice as always.</p><br/><p>This member was anxious! He was anxious enough to jump around!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was about to be pulled down from the throne. How could he still be so calm?</p><br/><p>This time, the scores for Xi Ze and Ming Yu weren\u2019t much different but Xi Ze\u2019s reputation in the world was still better than Ming Yu. Otherwise, the positions would\u2019ve already changed!</p><br/><p>All the members had a three day conference and then an eight day conference before deciding to keep Xi Ze in first place. As an insider, the member couldn\u2019t say it but he knew that Xi Ze\u2019s points were only one digit higher than Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>According to Ming Yu\u2019s progress, this gap would definitely be exceeded next time!</p><br/><p>How could Mr. Xi still be so calm?</p><br/><p>There were rumours that the reason why Xi Ze became active again in the industry, walking in a show and shooting a cover, was to keep his position. Then his lover could surpass him in a bright and fair away.</p><br/><p>If this was true, he was too strict with his wife?</p><br/><p>The member didn\u2019t know that Xi Ze wasn\u2019t focusing on supermodel work. He was busy was the Ji and Ya show to be held in mid-December.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t put his time into supermodel work but he never relaxed. Was the reason why he could maintain the first ranking only due to his reputation in the past?</p><br/><p>His contribution to Ji and Ya in these years was the biggest reason why he hadn\u2019t fallen in the rankings.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t relax and it could be said that to improve his points, he walked in a show and shot a cover. If the confidential records of the World Supermodels Organization opened, people would see that Xi Ze\u2019s points really improved in the last year.</p><br/><p>Without any extra efforts, Mr. Xi would already be pulled down by a certain mushroom.</p><br/><p>No matter the outside wind and rain, no matter what other people thought about the delayed supermodel rankings in September.</p><br/><p>On December 1st, under the eyes of attention of everyone, the World Supermodels Organization suddenly released the rankings on time and changed the background of their official website.</p><br/><p>When a person first entered the World Supermodels Organization\u2019s official website, they were see that there was a person on the left and another person on the right sides of the screen. The left side contained the first ranked male supermodel and the right side contained the first ranked female supermodel. In the last five or six years, these two positions were firmly controlled by Xi Ze and Cecilia and couldn\u2019t be changed.</p><br/><p>Now in the last year, Cecilia\u2019s position had been occupied by Adenes. But for Xi Ze in the background, there was no change. He was the first ranked supermodel in the world who no one could shake!</p><br/><p>But this background wasn\u2019t the first thing people saw. In order to maintain the mystery of the rankings, they could only see this photo after the rankings were released every three months.</p><br/><p>Now once everyone opened the supermodel rankings and looked at them as usual, their eyes suddenly stopped looking at the dense words!</p><br/><p>They saw the beautiful youth who appeared on the left side of the photo!</p><br/><p>He wore a simple and beautiful white shirt and the skin shone behind him, brightening his fair and translucent skin. He slightly leaned against the wall and looked at them with clear and clean amber eyes. He was ethereal with a touch of coldness.</p><br/><p>His smooth facial line, gem-like eyes, fragile high bridge of the nose, his collarbone and the neat curves of his tall body was really eye-catching and refreshing when combined with the background.</p><br/><p>A quiet and beautiful temperament spread from his body, as well as an indifferent and cold aura!</p><br/><p>The day before, this position contained an image of a man. The man was indifferent, noble and elegant. He didn\u2019t look directly at the camera but anyone who saw it would be breathless and not dare to blink.</p><br/><p>Now this person had been changed!</p><br/><p>It was the same dark hair and handsome appearance, but his name was no longer Xi Ze. He was called\u2014</p><br/><p>\u300e Ming Yu \u300f.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

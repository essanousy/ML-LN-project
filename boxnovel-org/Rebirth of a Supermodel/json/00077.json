Once the lips rubbed over his cheeks, the temperature was so hot that Xi Ze froze, allowing Ming Yu to drag him into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u2026Don\u2019t ask why Ming Xiaoyu suddenly had so much strength after not exercising for a few days.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xi Ze\u2019s entire upper body was dragged down by the youth and he lay parallel on the bed in the youth\u2019s arms, making him slightly\u2026 at a loss.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s left hand was gently resting on his waist, while the right hand was sliding over his shoulder. It moved upwards and upwards, until it finally rested on Xi Ze\u2019s hair and gently\u2026kneaded?</p><br/><p>Yes, it was rubbing it twice!</p><br/><p>The action was like comforting a small animal!</p><br/><p>It was a type of gently rubbing, kneading twice, then rubbing again repetition.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was silent and felt flustered by the youth\u2019s strange actions, but he didn\u2019t struggle. His face was pressed tightly against the boy\u2019s hot cheeks, the warm breath from the other\u2019s mouth blowing out gently against his ears.</p><br/><p>This ambiguous distance made Xi Ze\u2019s heartbeat accelerate. He vaguely felt blood rushing towards the lower part of his body, especially when the youth twitched and turned slightly, rubbing his lips against Xi Ze\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The dark eyes became deeper. In a way that Ming Yu couldn\u2019t see (Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t have his eyes open), Xi Ze closed his eyes helplessly. Then he slowly reached out and hugged the young man beneath him. He embraced the other person\u2019s waist tightly and slowly raised his head. He looked at the youth\u2019s closed eyes and gradually leaned over.</p><br/><p>Due to the overheated body, the youth\u2019s hot breath blew on Xi Ze\u2019s face as the distance between the two people got closer. Xi Ze was just about to kiss the lips when he suddenly heard Ming Yu say, \u201cDarling, don\u2019t play\u2026uh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Ming Xiaoyu rubbed his hair again and said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Itchy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c!!!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was his Darling? Say it!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026I will give you a bone in the evening. Don\u2019t move\u2026 throw the frisbee tomorrow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>A long time ago, it was mentioned that Ming Xiaoyu raised a silly husky in his last life. The husky\u2019s biggest hobby was licking his owner and his goal in life was to wake up the small mushroom in bed every day.</p><br/><p>The name of the stupid husky\u2014</p><br/><p>Darling.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t laugh! Weren\u2019t names like \u2018Caesar the Great\u2019, \u2018Napoleon\u2019 and \u2018Monroe\u2019 stupid?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t understand when \u2018Darling\u2019 had a relationship with a dog, but it didn\u2019t stop him from knowing that he wouldn\u2019t chew on a bone, let alone play with a frisbee!</p><br/><p>It was probably a dog that Ming Yu had preciously\u2026 cough cough, raised and then mistook him for the dog.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze couldn\u2019t admit that he already guessed why Ming Yu misunderstood. How could he be like a dog?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t talk about appearance, even the species was different!</p><br/><p>However, after being disturbed by \u2018bones\u2019, the atmosphere was broken. The boy\u2019s pale face and hot breathing made him feel distressed. He lay in the youth\u2019s arms until Ming Yu took the initiative to change his posture 10 minutes later. Then Xi Ze got up.</p><br/><p>After some light exercises to relieve his muscle soreness, Xi Ze looked at the youth\u2019s face for a long time with a complicated expression. Then he sighed deeply and headed to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Xi Ze didn\u2019t know that after he closed the bedroom door, the eyes of the youth unexpectedly opened!</p><br/><p>Due to the fever, Ming Yu\u2019s eyes were moist and not as clear as before. He could just barely open them. His blurred eyes stared at the ceiling without any focus. After a long pause, he coughed twice and closed his eyes to sleep again.</p><br/><p>In such a situation, Xi Ze didn\u2019t know it but the youth was completely awake!</p><br/><p>When Xi Ze sat beside his bed and stroked his lips, Ming Yu thought it was a dream and pulled the other person into his arms, simply intending to hold him as a pillow and sleep well.</p><br/><p>But once he actually embraced the other person, he was clearly awakened by the high temperature and sobered up. Ming Yu realized that he unexpectedly did such a thing in his daze.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s subconscious response was to pretend to be sleeping.</p><br/><p>Right now, his mind was very dizzy!</p><br/><p>He felt like Xi Ze was going to do something. Thus, Ming Yu could only shout the name of his dog\u2026 Keke, it was the name of a dog and the strange atmosphere was quickly broken.</p><br/><p>His eyes might not be open, but Ming Yu knew that his lips might only be half a centimetre away from the man\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Did he not want to kiss Xi Ze?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu just felt that today was definitely not a good time. He was currently suffering from a bit of mental confusion from his illness. No matter what choice was made, it was impossible to determine if it really came from his heart.</p><br/><p>The most important reason was that Ming Xiaoyu always liked to take the initiative\uff5e</p><br/><p>This man pressing him down and kissing him?</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>This pose was completely wrong!!</p><br/><p>The unknowing Xi Ze, \u201c\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>With these strange thoughts, Ming Xiaoyu once again fell asleep. Once he woke up again, the sky was dark and the street lamps were all light up. Faint light could be seen through the gap in the bedroom door.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu touched his forehead and found that it wasn\u2019t so hot. His body also had some strength restored.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xi Ze finished cooking dinner and lightly pushed the door open. He was slightly startled when he saw that Ming Yu had awakened. Then he set the dinner plate on the beside table, directly disinfected the thermometer and placed it in front of Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>The small mushroom shivered and blinked. \u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>The handsome and elegant man rolled up his cuffs, revealing his thin wrists. Then Xi Ze spoke like it was natural. \u201cMeasure your temperature.\u201d</p><br/><p>The small mushroom obediently placed the thermometer in his mouth and bit it.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was very patient and picked up the bowl of red bean and glutinous rice porridge. He kept stirring the porridge with a small spoon to help it cool down. The glutinous rice porridge was really thick and delicate. Every grain of glutinous rice was like tiny broken pearls. They rolled round and round in the porridge soup.</p><br/><p>The red beams were thoroughly boiled and seemed to have become red bean paste. The red bean paste mixed with the milky white glutinous rice looked sweet and savoury. It was particularly attractive.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly put down the glutinous rice porridge, causing Ming Yu to stare with surprise.</p><br/><p>The porridge was cooked very well. Then look at the side dishes, which were light, refreshing and beautifully placed. There was even a carved flower radish next to the pickles! A carved flower radish!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Your take-out delivery was too obvious\u2026</p><br/><p>Xi Ze choose not to notice the youth\u2019s expression. Once the time was up, he looked at the thermometer carefully. Finally, he said, \u201cYour temperature has dropped and you no longer have a fever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze turned to look at Ming Yu when he finished talking. However, he suddenly became startled.</p><br/><p>The youth had just woken up and there was a layer of translucent water on his throat. He was no longer burning up, but his cheeks were still red and his lips were bright and shiny.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze fixed his mind and said quietly, \u201cI cooked some porridge and side dishes for you. You haven\u2019t eaten all day so something light will be good for your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu received the bowl from Xi Ze and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou personally made this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly nodded. \u201cYes, I did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Xi Ze placed a small table on the bed and put the dishes on it one by one for Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>The side dishes were more exquisite than the red bean glutinous rice porridge! Forget the carved radish, there was shredded lotus root and fresh tofu. Every dish was first-class and also carefully decorated with a variety of carved objects.</p><br/><p>Well, okay, if you said that you did it personally than you did it personally \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d. Ming Yu was taking small mouthfuls of the glutinous rice porridge when Xi Ze sudednly asked, \u201cIs this cold because of the filming on the island?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu jerked and looked at at Xi Ze. The latter was looking down at him with a mysterious expression. There wasn\u2019t much to be seen on the cold and elegant face, but he seemed a bit unhappy.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu instantly smiled, \u201cIt is part of the reason. I\u2019m sorry that you had to take care of me today. I didn\u2019t realize that you would come to my house. It was really hard for you. When did you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other person was about to return to the original topic. Then Ming Yu suddenly asked, \u201cXi Ze, there is something I want to confirm with you. This time, did you interfere in the marketing promoting for the Nidelan Smoke perfumes?\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>TL Note: For those of you who missed the translator\u2019s note that I added later and were confused by the anti-aircraft gun thing, go back to chapter 75 and read the translator\u2019s note that I added.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

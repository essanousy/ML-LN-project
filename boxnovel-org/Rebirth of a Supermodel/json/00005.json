The high quality SLR camera snapped as they shot photos, while the models in the lens showed off their most dazzling side.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the crowd, Zhao Rui listened to Ming Yu\u2019s words and couldn\u2019t help feeling a trace of guilt. He sighed and said, \u201cYes, when I went to get your clothes, I found out that Fashion Entertainment decided to change your image.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s eyes narrowed, \u201cWas it the deputy editor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the deputy editor is Zhu Wei\u2019s lover. Sister Lin\u2019s words were true and Zhu Wei has been acting ostentatiously lately. He is probably angry at your previous behaviour, causing this to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui paused before continuing. \u201cMing Yu, I am also to blame. I don\u2019t have a lot of weight in the company, so I can\u2019t fight for more rights for you. In fact, they wanted you to shoot with an explicit style, which was really too much. I managed to negotiate with them and it was replaced with the present clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at the clothes in Zhao Rui\u2019s hand. He pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cBrother Zhao, this incident was caused by me. It is my fault so don\u2019t take it to heart. I think that this type of style is also very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui listened to these words and thought Ming Yu was trying to comfort him. He immediately took responsibility. \u201cHow can you say that you caused it? I, as your agent, couldn\u2019t stand up and help you when you are being humiliated. Now that you are deliberately oppressed by the magazine, it is obviously my fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was surprised by Zhao Rui\u2019s solemn tone. He glanced at the red face of his anxious agent. Slowly, his heart that had been floating in the air since coming to this world finally stabilized completely.</p><br/><p>The youth couldn\u2019t help showing a brilliant smile on his beautiful face. Ming Yu nodded. \u201cYes yes, I was wrong. Brother Zhao\u2026 shouldn\u2019t I quickly go and change clothes? It is my turn to take the photos now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui nodded and they walked together to the changing room.</p><br/><p>There were too many models today, so the studio had set up a lot of temporary changing rooms. The changing room only had a few curtains to cover the inside, with no locks, so Zhao Rui stood guard at the door while Ming Yu changed.</p><br/><p>One was a male model who once appeared in a first-tier magazine, and the other person was the agent of a popular model. Now the two of them were reduced to this. It really was like starting from scratch.</p><br/><p>Today, Ming Yu decided to take this inexperienced agent with him towards the top of the fashion industry.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was a hard-working agent and dedicated to his models, fighting for resources. However, he was still a little young and inexperienced, not throughly understand the nature of this work. Cheng Su could rise because the company took the initiative to give a lot of resources to Ming Yu, while Cheng Su stole. Then Cheng Su dumped Zhao Rui as his agent\u2026</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sighed. He felt like his agent\u2019s capacity wasn\u2019t sufficient.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t forget his history. Zhao Rui had been really good to him and fought for resources. Ming Yu realized it. This world was real. There were many good and pure people in the world. Since he came here, he naturally had to make some changes.</p><br/><p>The youth opened the curtain and walked out of the changing room. Zhao Rui, who was waiting outside the curtain, stopped with surprise for a moment, but slowly recovered.</p><br/><p>From three years ago to now, Zhao Rui witnessed the birth of a \u2018top supermodel.\u2019 The reason for the quotation marks was that this young man had the qualities to become a top supermodel. However, now only had he failed to become world famous in three years, he gradually took a downhill path.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui never thought to blame Ming Yu for the failure. On the contrary, he considered this downward path was due to his actions as an agent. Sometimes Zhao Rui thought that if he hadn\u2019t tried his best to put all the resources into Ming Yu, what would the youth look like now?</p><br/><p>However, there was no point wondering about what ifs.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhao, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s slender fingers waved in front of Zhao Rui\u2019s eyes a few times. The latter woke up and laughed dryly. \u201cThe design of these clothing is still good. It is made by a cutting-edge designer, so you look very nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they walked, Zhao Rui explained, \u201cThe designer isn\u2019t famous yet, but it is thought that this girl will soon become a first-rate designer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help feeling a little interested. \u201cOh? How old is this designer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui smiled. \u201cIt seems she is only five years older than you, so the designer is very young. He didn\u2019t talk any longer about this topic. Zhao Rui\u2019s smile gradually faded as he frowned. \u201cMing Yu, the clothing suits you but for today\u2019s magazine theme\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s lips slightly tilted and he asked in a calm tone, \u201cBrother Zhao, if the clothing isn\u2019t suitable for today\u2019s theme\u2026 why is it in the studio today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was suddenly tongue-tied. \u201cThat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu maintained his smile as he spoke meaningfully. \u201cThings might not be as bad as we think. Maybe\u2026 this is actually a turning point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui had known this body for three years, but Ming Yu suddenly became more dazzling this days. Zhao Rui had some immunity, but he couldn\u2019t help feeling amazed the moment Ming Yu opened the curtains.</p><br/><p>If Zhao Rui was surprised, other people wouldn\u2019t be able to accept it so easily!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was still young, but he was handsome and tall, with a straight posture. He was even one or two centimetres taller than some of the models present. The general black jacket with the high collar fell to just below his hip bone and integrated with the black trousers.</p><br/><p>The hem of this jacket was a little longer on the left, giving it a distinctive asymmetrical design, creating a beautiful mess of confusion. The small suit was made of high grade cotton with excellent transparency. Inside was a light grey linen shirt with an overall dark tone, but there was an amazing peacock blue scarf around the neck.</p><br/><p>The scarf wrapped beautifully around the clavicle. It didn\u2019t take away from the overall sense of the clothing. The only bright colour embellished the body just right, creating an impressive effect.</p><br/><p>Anyone who saw this young man would involuntarily think that this man was made to wear clothes.</p><br/><p>Yes, the laymen always said that models were clothes rack. However, clothes racks were also divided by quality. In a designer\u2019s hands, a beautiful piece of clothing could be arranged to produce different results. However, Ming Yu had already achieved what the designers should do.</p><br/><p>Despite using a shabby changing room with no mirrors, Ming Yu had calmly worn the clothing, placing the thin scarf and jacket at the appropriate angle to match the overall style. Before leaving the dressing room, he had picked up an invisible hair clip that someone had dropped on the ground. He deliberately clipped up his hair on the right side, revealing an excellent jaw line.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui had been talking to Ming Yu while walking, so he naturally didn\u2019t figure out that the young model\u2019s hairstyle had changed a bit. But for other people, they saw this dazzling teenager from an overall perspective!</p><br/><p>Temperament, or aura, was an important factor that distinguished top supermodels from other models.</p><br/><p>For example, one of the top three major modelling agencies in Huaxia, Lanka Company had Du Ruo, who was fully deserving of being called a supermodel. When the world\u2019s third ranked female supermodel walked on a stage, she could charm the crowd with her charming smile, elegant curves of her body and every gesture while walking, so that they were intoxicated.</p><br/><p>The studio wasn\u2019t a runway, so Ming Yu deliberately didn\u2019t show his aura. However, once he walked, he unconsciously revealed a bearing that was unique to top models. This made many people feel startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy looks really good\u2026 is he really a magazine model?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Ming Yu and he is from Muse. It seems he did a few big shows when he first debuted, so he is a little famous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder this person\u2019s temperament is so good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>And so on, similar words were heard in every corner of the studio. Sister Lin heard this and stopped her hands that were powdering someone. She looked up and froze when she saw the young man not far away.</p><br/><p>\u2026Ming Yu\u2019s hair style?</p><br/><p>No, the point was\u2014 Ming Yu changed clothes?</p><br/><p>At the beginning of Ming Yu\u2019s make-up session, Sister Lin had helped him with his hair, matching it to the clothes he was wearing today. However, Sister Lin was surprised to find that not only had Ming Yu changed clothes, even his hairstyle had changed!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t underestimate this little change. It allowed the original young style to undergo enormous changes. Sister Lin even doubted if this young man was the person she had just talked to!</p><br/><p>He was gloomy but handsome, pale but not decadent.</p><br/><p>The theme for the next installment of \u2018Trendy Fashion was \u2018At the age of 18.\u2019 It was a bit vague, but it clearly referred to the youthful style that highlighted a youthful look.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s original clothing was bright jeans, with a punk style black and white hat, easily showing off the nature of young people.</p><br/><p>But now this style\u2026</p><br/><p>Sister Lin frowned and couldn\u2019t help feeling worried.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ming Yu and Zhao Rui arrived at the place where their shoot would take place. They had one day to shoot a thousand photos, so the magazine\u2019s photographer didn\u2019t put in a lot of effort to discuss with the models. The photographer just said a few words to Ming Yu, then the latter headed to towards the centre of the white set.</p><br/><p>The youth looked back with his lips slightly raised, revealing a touch of an imperceptible smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

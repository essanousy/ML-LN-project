Then he walked to the soft in a steady and calm manner and\u2014</p><br/><p><i>Bang!</i></p><br/><p>Kneeling on the magazine!</p><br/><p>The bang frightened Small Mushroom a bit, causing him to jerk and making him unable to respond for a while.</p><br/><p>Although he gaze Xi Ze three choices, everyone knew that this was a joke and couldn\u2019t be taken seriously.</p><br/><p>What type of man was Xi Ze? Did he really fall to his knees?</p><br/><p>There was no need to talk about outsiders. Even to Ming Yu, Xi Ze would only kneel in bed due to some positions\u2026</p><br/><p>This was a preemptive strike! Mr. Xi was really wonderful!</p><br/><p>You see, didn\u2019t Mushroom become a stupefied mushroom?</p><br/><p>The next second, Xi Ze made a dignified look and started to state his crimes in a tone of grief. \u201cI was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have deceived you to sneakily buy a lot of magazines, perfumes, watches and jewelry. I didn\u2019t help you with your mortgage when your mortgage hadn\u2019t been paid off and I didn\u2019t buy you a car. Instead, I spent money on\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute! You\u2019re not allowed to repay the mortgage! You\u2019re not allowed to buy a car! Listen! They are from my vault!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the beginning, Ming Xiaoyu felt it was familiar. But after a while, it was a bit wrong. As the head of the household, although his ability to make money wasn\u2019t as much as Xi Ze, he still earned a lot! How many people could buy a high-end apartment in the Third Ring of the capital within one year? And it was fully paid off!</p><br/><p>In addition, Ming Xiaoyu had saved a lot of money recently and was ready to buy two good cars. It might be impossible to buy a Ferrari or a luxury Bentley like Xi Ze for a while, but it wasn\u2019t a problem to buy a car that said \u2018Don\u2019t touch!\u2019 Buying a nice car, wasn\u2019t this complete?</p><br/><p>As the head of the household, how can he let his wife buy the house and the car?</p><br/><p>His dignity would be gone!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s face was dark when he heard Ming Yu\u2019s words, but he soon got an idea. Next, he continued confessing his guilt. \u201cAs part of the family, I was a bit wrong. But if you think about it, I didn\u2019t buy too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s head exploded when he heard this. \u201cNot much? How many magazines? How many perfumes? How many watches and jewelry? You even bought a house? This isn\u2019t too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to this, Xi Ze seriously explained, \u201cThe magazines can be used as gifts to be given away. All the magazines I bought, at least 8-9,000 have been sent out and there isn\u2019t much left. I didn\u2019t buy a lot of perfumes, only one or two hundred sets\u2026 cough, don\u2019t worry. I sent them to a lot of people. As for the watch, it is the same. I sent a lot out, it is useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to these words, he seemed to have a point.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it, Ming Yu said, \u201cThen the house? Isn\u2019t the house expensive? It is a villa in the capital\u2019s Fourth Ring, it must be worth tens of millions! You are really wasteful! \u201cWith my savings, I barely bought a seven figure home a few months ago. Yet you spent eight figures buying a house\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips curved when he listened to the youth. He stood up from the magazine and said, \u201cActually, if you think about it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth immediately stared, \u201cEh?\u2019</p><br/><p>The man immediately went back to kneeling on the magazine and said earnestly, \u201cThe house, it is real estate. Now the prices have been rising. Since I bought this house last year, it has risen by 10%. Isn\u2019t this a good investment? After we have sent all the things in the house away, I want to move in with you and live out our days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man stood up again and sketched a bright future. He walked to the sofa and touched the youth\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe house is near Kunming Lake. When it is spring, we can go out to play. When it is autumn, we can go to the lake for autumn camping. In summer, it is hot so we will turn on air conditioning in the house. In winter, I will take you to outdoor barbecues.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we are working, we can\u2019t be together. When we aren\u2019t working, we will have warm little days in our house. In the attic on the top floor of the house, I have replaced all the ceilings with one-sided glass. We can look at the moon and stars in the attack. There is a bed there so, cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A fist interrupted the man\u2019s nasty thoughts and Ming Yu sneered. \u201cYou have your frequencies connected wrongly. Mr. Z, this isn\u2019t a romance drama. Your narrative is really not good enough. Go camping at Kunming Lake? The staff member will criticize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mr. Xi wasn\u2019t uncomfortable about his lies being uncovered. He shook his head with regret and said, \u201cIt seems that I can\u2019t deceive you. We can\u2019t go to Kunming Lake for camping but we really can pass our days there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have been speaking a love story.\u201d The youth spoke with no expression. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied. Mr. Z, how did you run to the sofa from the magazine? Can you give me a demonstration again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s foot shot out to kick this shameless man.</p><br/><p>However, Xi Ze\u2019s hand suddenly grabbed Ming Yu\u2019s foot. As Ming Yu looked at him with surprise, he stroked the delicate skin with his fingers and laughed. \u201cSince you aren\u2019t satisfied with my words of love, then mushroom\u2026 I will satisfy you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu probably shouldn\u2019t have said anything further.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu never imagined that the fragrance he prepared would be sprayed on his body, the watch he prepared would be hung on a part of his body and the magazine he prepared was used for the man to kneel and relentlessly take him from behind!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are too thin, you should have a bit more meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard wasteful spender, I will break your leg\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen come and break my leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a time, it was beautiful and romantic.</p><br/><p>With the help of props, Mr. Xi repeatedly slept with a sensitive mushroom on the soft. The last time, the originally crushed mushroom suddenly turned over and became enchanting. His eyebrows raised as he suppressed the wheezing in his throat. He declared, \u201cMr. Z, I want to issue a fourth house rule.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Xi Ze was on the verge of erupting and could only control himself so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now all, all the financial power of the family will be controlled by the owner! You are only allowed to spend seven figures every month. Once you exceed it, you must report it to me! You aren\u2019t allowed to do any more messy things and you can\u2019t deceive me, not letting me know uh\u2026 don\u2019t move\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will listen to you so let me release it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lust really ruined people!</p><br/><p>The always calm and rational Mr. Xi immediately gave up his financial power!</p><br/><p>The next day, Xi Ze calmly took out all the black cards, diamond cards and gold cards from his wallet. After seeing that the youth still looked suspicious, Mr. Xi sighed and also handed over his checkbook.</p><br/><p>At this point, the home owner looked proud while the poor family member was oppressed.</p><br/><p>But as Master Chen once said, \u2018it takes constant vigilance to stave off evil.\u2019</p><br/><p>After leaving home, Mr. Xi came to the Ji and Ya studio and said to his agent, \u201cHelp me go to the bank to order a checkbook and fund it. The amount will be drawn from the account of the Muse shareholders, don\u2019t involve other accounts.\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking the cards, Ming Xiaoyu would always stare at the money flow in these cards. However, he also gave the man a seven figure sum every month. Xi Ze often had to socialize so this seven figure sum should absolutely be enough.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was really thoughtful. The checkbook was gone so Xi Ze couldn\u2019t write a blank cheque anymore. The bank cards were with Ming Yu so Xi Ze couldn\u2019t report the card number and get new cards. He really handled everything!</p><br/><p>Except he didn\u2019t think that the child he raised could actually make money!!!</p><br/><p>Having more than a dozen cards, this wasn\u2019t Mr. Xi\u2019s style.</p><br/><p>He had a few more accounts on his body, meaning there wasn\u2019t pressure on Mr. Xi.</p><br/><p>As a result, the seemingly imminent storm slowly dissolved. In the next month, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans often found a strange phenomenon.</p><br/><p>The big hand of the fan circle, lead mushroom fan God Zyu! He actually had an ambiguous relationship with a small fan!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: Your name is too eye-catching. Isn\u2019t is better to change it? @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: Give me your address and I will send you the prizes @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: Didn\u2019t you see my message? How are you doing? Hello? Moshi moshi? @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ahhhh!!!!</p><br/><p>Who was God Z?</p><br/><p>The first leader of the mushroom fans!</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was a noble, cool and not easy to speak top fan!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, God Z changed. He was a little fan who wasn\u2019t known at all. Was it because this small fan refused to give him the address for the prizes that he was so concerned?</p><br/><p>God X, look at me, I won\u2019t give you my address ahhh!!!</p><br/><p>God Z arbitrarily shouted for half a month!</p><br/><p>Then many fans started curiously writing and drawing their own stories about this fan, such as Zyu x good legs, good legs x Zyu\u2026 cough, \u2018good legs,\u2019 this abbreviation was actually quite good. Do you readers feel it is quiet smooth?</p><br/><p>In any case, the fans played a variety of CPs and after many episodes, added Xiao Biqing as a supporting role!</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing: \u2026I am a dog.</p><br/><p>Time passed in this busy and fulfilling way. On January 2nd, 2018. the second day of the new year, the eyes of the global fashion industry gathered in the capital of Huaxia to welcome the arrival of the annual Muse Fashion Party!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

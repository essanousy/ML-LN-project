God Xi didn\u2019t do the things you are imagining. Rather, he carefully guided Ming Xiaoyu on how to write!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze admitted that he had a bit of an obsession with cleanliness, but it wasn\u2019t paranoia. But once he saw Ming Yu\u2019s handwriting, his designer aesthetics couldn\u2019t let him bear such a detail. The muse he chose really wrote with such handwriting!</p><br/><p>Change! It must change! Even if it didn\u2019t look good, at least it wasn\u2019t too ugly!</p><br/><p>\u2026Later, this thought slowly became \u2018Well, we will start with it being pleasing to the eye.\u2019</p><br/><p>For two hours, Xi Ze sat beside Ming Yu, writing out each character in a seal copybook. Xi Ze finished writing and then handed it to Ming Yu to copy. The paper was transparent so it could be copied! Can\u2019t you even draw a stroke?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze guessed right. Ming Yu couldn\u2019t even draw a stroke. The moment he did, the character would instantly be restored to the original dog writing, without any improvement.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026In fact, my handwriting is okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Xi Ze completely gave up on the strokes practice, having him practice calligraphy. Who came up with this stupid idea? This little fish already had ugly handwriting to the extent that even his strokes were ridiculous!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu said, \u201c\u2026I feel like your expression is saying that my characters are really ugly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze asked with indifferent eyes, \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu carefully looked at him before nodding with certainly. \u201cYes, I feel like you are now saying \u2018How can someone write such ugly words? Is this really a person\u2019s writing?\u2019 But Xi Ze, my handwriting isn\u2019t ugly to that extent, right? I am exaggerating a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026 ?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Since this failed, Xi Ze\u2019s choice was direct hands-on teaching with the youth!</p><br/><p>As the man\u2019s slender fingers grasped Ming Yu\u2019s fingers while holding the pen, Ming Yu felt a strange feeling fill his heart. This posture could be regarded as an alternative type of interlocking ten fingers, but Xi Ze\u2019s serious expression meant Ming Yu couldn\u2019t think that.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had a vague guess about the man\u2019s behaviour. But after figuring it out, his lips curved and he didn\u2019t say anything as the other hand holding his started to write out a stroke.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thought his handwriting was quite good? Yes, but he also understood that Xi Ze\u2019s characters were absolutely well written. Fei Sixin had previous said that Xi Ze wrote even better than Du Ruo. Du Ruo had been practicing calligraphy since she was 4, so you can guess how good Xi Ze\u2019s words were.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s handwriting was recognized as beautiful in the industry.</p><br/><p>Despite holding a cheap pen and Ming Yu\u2019s hand, Xi Ze wrote out smooth characters that weren\u2019t sharp. His characters seemed to be like a phoenix elegantly landing on a lake, perfect and wonderful. After seeing it for a long time, he could tell that it wasn\u2019t hard characters. It was like Xi Ze was writing with a very small pen.</p><br/><p>A hot temperature passed down at the point where their fingers met. Ming Yu calmly looked at the other person holding his hand to write beautiful characters and his lips slightly tilted up.</p><br/><p>In the case of friends, this behaviour was already too much.</p><br/><p>But none of the two men raised any questions, simply continuing with their actions.</p><br/><p>By the time the two of them filled two sheets of paper, MIng Yu hadn\u2019t yet found the knack for writing, but he vaguely had an idea. According to Xi Ze, \u201cIf you persevere, maybe three\u2026 within a year, you can write normal words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please think before speaking next time! Swallow down your \u2018three years!\u2019</p><br/><p>In the end, Xi Ze didn\u2019t leave Ming Yu\u2019s home until 11 p.m. Once the other person left, Ming Yu wasn\u2019t \u2018shy shy\u2019 or in chaos. He calmly washed up like nothing happened and slept early.</p><br/><p>Only, before closing his eyes, Ming Yu gaze up at the city lights reflected on the ceiling, thinking for a long time. Finally, he slowly closed his eyes and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>On the top floor of the Muse apartments, Xi Ze poured himself a cup of warm water and called Ding Bo.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was in a very noisy place. However, once he heard Xi Ze\u2019s call, he quickly left the room and asked, \u201cWhy are you calling so late? Aren\u2019t you going to a party tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man gently replied \u201cAh,\u201d and then asked, \u201cHave things with Luo Cheng been resolved yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo sighed heavily and replied. \u201cYes, \u2018Eda Lisa\u2019 isn\u2019t happy but we also can\u2019t cooperate with their US side any longer. Now the two sides are discussing the issue of the contract. Everyone is saying that the other party breached the contract first, so it is very troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo find Raymond Celtic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was surprised and asked, \u201cAre you getting involved in this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Eda Lisa. You handled it well, so good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo laughed and said, \u201cIf you allowed me to find Raymond earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have to listen to so much nonsense. By the way, didn\u2019t you go to the Muse apartment today? Why are you resting so late?\u201d</p><br/><p>After chatting with his old friend for a while, Xi Ze suddenly asked, \u201cSend me a copy of Ming Yu\u2019s upcoming jobs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo asked with surprise. \u201cWhat? How can I possible have it? It is in that kid Zhao Rui\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Xiang will have a way. I will be waiting for your email. Goodnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>After giving an order, Xi Ze didn\u2019t wait for Ding Bo to reply and suddenly hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>In the still and dark night, the atmosphere of spring became clearer. However, winter was till trying to wreak havoc for a while. The strong evening breeze whistled through the city at high altitudes, while Xi Ze looked down through the window at the night lights of the capital.</p><br/><p>It was very easy to communicate between smart people.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have to put out some things because he already conveyed what he meant, and he knew that the other person understood.</p><br/><p>He was a designer, but before he became a designer, he was Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>What type of identity did a muse have for a designer? A muse was their source of inspiration, someone they could get countless inspirations from.</p><br/><p>Why did one particular person in the world become their muse, not one of the other 7 billion people in the world?</p><br/><p>It was because at first sight, they were attracted to him/her. This person was the beauty their heart was longing for, the most profound embodiment of beauty.</p><br/><p>As a designer, if he didn\u2019t pursue the beauty he had been craving all his life, what would he pursue?</p><br/><p>That person was always bad, always opinionated, secretly mischievous and cunning.</p><br/><p>\u2026Yes, he was cute.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next day, Ming Yu only got 2 NGs before smoothly passing.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention the director, even Zhao Rui and Luo Ru were greatly surprised. When they asked Ming Xiaoyu what panacea he ate to receive suddenly enlightenment, Ming Yu didn\u2019t try to hide it. \u201cYesterday, Xi Ze helped me act it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Luo Ru asked, \u201cXiaoyu, did you go to the company yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu unexpectedly shook his head. \u201cXi Ze came to my house to help me. I didn\u2019t go to the company.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Zhao Rui and Luo Ru, \u201c!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one person, Sister Cheng left and she took on the mission of questioning Ming Xiaoyu. \u201cXiaoyu, did Xi Ze come to find you for some matter, so you asked him for help and he agreed?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, she saw this handsome youth smile and asked with surprise, \u201cSister Zheng, why do you think that? Xi Ze came to my home to visit. He saw me pondering over the script and offered to help. Oh yes, I cooked him a bowl of noodles as thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned into Zhao Rui, Luo Ru and Sister Zheng, \u201c!!!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A bowl of noodles?</p><br/><p>You paid Xi Ze back with a bowl of noodles?</p><br/><p>This was Xi Ze, not Ding Bo! (Ding Bo: Hello!)</p><br/><p>A bowl of noodles as thanks really didn\u2019t fit!!!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, don\u2019t you have a conscience? God Xi helped you with acting?</p><br/><p>It was too hard to believe.</p><br/><p>In any case, the next two scenes passed quickly after Ming Yu finished the most difficult shot. At this point, the MV shooting was entirely over and there was a farewell dinner to celebrate the success of the filming.</p><br/><p>At the table, Zhu Kejia and Ming Yu took a photo and added each other as friend. Zhu Kejia slightly edited the photo before posting it on her Wiebo, as well as mentioning Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zhu Kejia: Today I finished shooting with Small Mushroom Ming Yu. Ah, he is really young, I feel like old bacon next to him. Haha. [/Picture] \u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

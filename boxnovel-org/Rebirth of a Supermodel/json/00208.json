Ming Yu and Xi Ze\u2019s fans were already irritated by the questions and remembered the name of these newspapers, magazines and TV companies, stating that they must avoid them in the future.</p><br/><p>Now Xi Ze\u2019s name suddenly appeared at the scene and everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>They saw a handsome man calmly step out from backstage. Once he appeared in the light, the reporters\u2019 cameras were constantly used as they didn\u2019t notice that Ming Yu also looked surprised by Xi Ze\u2019s arrival and he pondered on it for a while.</p><br/><p>The first thing Xi Ze did after going on stage was to hold the youth\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s right hand was holding the microphone while his left hand was held tightly by Xi Ze. He looked up in surprise at the man who appeared next to him. Then Xi Ze slightly lowered his head and kissed Ming Yu\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>This kiss caused the audience to suck in their breaths while the netizens on their computers were shocked!</p><br/><p>What a surprise! He was so affectionate?</p><br/><p>This was a live broadcast! A live broadcast! A live broadcast!!!</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he know the meaning of the word live?</p><br/><p>It was as if he felt no embarrassment or shame about his behaviour. After Xi Ze pampered his mushroom, he took the microphone from Ming Yu\u2019s hand and turned to look at the reporters. \u201cMing Yu is tired so I will answer questions for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words caused the reporters to become excited and they raised their hands to asked the prepared questions.</p><br/><p>The next second, Xi Ze\u2019s lips thinned while his sharp eyes slightly narrowed. He said with a smile, \u201cI will be good and answer your questions. Please don\u2019t worry. In any case, this is still the press conference for An Li. Some questions must\u2019ve been prepared for a long time. We will wait three minutes and take a break. Then you can ask questions. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>His strong pressure instantly spread out with this words, causing people to be unable to breathe.</p><br/><p>A reporter wanted to say, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to rest\u201d but he hadn\u2019t finished talking when he met Xi Ze\u2019 calm and indifferent look. The colour of his eyes deepened as he stared at the reporter without any expression.</p><br/><p>The reporter, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He would just shut up, QAQ!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze had always been a person who did as he pleased. There was no one in the media world who would provoke him in person. In addition, the reporters who attended this time were at the level of a deputy editor at most. Even the chief editor didn\u2019t dare go against Xi Ze, how could they?</p><br/><p>The netizens in front of the computer seemed to see that Xi Ze had extinguished the reporters\u2019 fire. They \u2018rested\u2019 for three minutes and then started to ask questions.</p><br/><p>There was nothing too sharp about this wave of questions.</p><br/><p>The sharpest question was, \u201cWhat do you like about each other?\u201d This was completely harmless. However, the answer was quite intriguing. Xi Ze\u2019s answer was, \u201cHe is very cute.\u201d Meanwhile, Ming Yu\u2019s answer was, \u201cHe isn\u2019t cute, he really isn\u2019t cute. I want to see how not cute he can be.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence was naturally a love story. Ming Yu\u2019s face was full of smiles when he saw this. In front of the reporters\u2019 cameras, Xi Ze gently pinched his hand, causing Ming Yu to look askance at him.</p><br/><p>For a time, pink bubbles were scattered everywhere!</p><br/><p>This pair of bright-faced husbands, they previously weren\u2019t public yet now they weren\u2019t shy about showing love in front of the fans and reporters! The reporters were very excited. They rushed to take a few more photos before leaving to write the headlines. The fans in front of the computer yelled.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ahhhhh, how can they be so sweet? The way that Mushroom was looking at God Xi just now, too sweet!!! \u3011 Of course, there were many fans who originally came for the An Li movie, Fang Liangxiu or Xiao Biqing. After seeing this pair of mushroom husbands, they showed a bit of interest. The passersby turned into fans of this sweet couple.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the emergence of Ming Yu and Xi Ze, the focus of this premier was no longer on the movie itself. However, it also made An Li\u2019s popularity rise by several levels and they made all the headlines!</p><br/><p>No matter what was used to attract the attention of fans, An Li was really a fire.</p><br/><p>After the interview, it was the real premiere. Ming Yu and Xi Ze were naturally arranged in seats next to each other fr the viewing. Even after the lights were extinguished, Xi Ze didn\u2019t release his grip on the youth\u2019s hands. Their fingers were tightly interlocked and the palms stuck together, leaving no gaps.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was completely unaware of Xi Ze\u2019s arrival. After Director Xu invited Ming Yu, a certain man quickly got the news. He was an outsider with nothing to do with the movie. There was absolutely no need for him to attend the premier.</p><br/><p>For some people, coming to the premiere of an annual blockbuster was to create heat for themselves. But for Xi Ze, his presence at a premier created a hot talk about the movie!</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Xu said that you came by yourself, he didn\u2019t invite you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the movie started, Ming Yu whispered softly in Xi Ze\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly raised his eyebrows and turned to stare into the youth\u2019s face. He whispered, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t come, they will target you. In their eyes, you are a newcomer and they can casually ask questions. They won\u2019t stop even if you answer them.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a pause before Xi Ze asked, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t come, who would protect you, my Good Legs?\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, this was a pleasant sentiment. Therefore, the proud Ming Xiaoyu just scoffed before reluctantly agreeing.</p><br/><p>The two people teased each other for a while before the movie began.</p><br/><p>A large black dragon flew from one end of the big screen to the other. There was a dazzling silver light, lightning flashed and the words An Li appeared with a thunderous sound. This moment attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>The opening started with the green mountains, the stream flowing between trees and the smoke gently blowing into the sky. A loving couple and a dutiful daughter, everything seemed warm and natural until the sudden massacre.</p><br/><p>Wearing faded linen and coarse cloth between her hair, the heroic heroine was reborn from her hatred and descended the mountain.</p><br/><p>The martial arts of An Li, there was no familiar Wudang Shaolin or the Emei gang that people were used to. This was a completely different world! The audience had to accept the martial arts along with the heroine.</p><br/><p>She met a martial arts lord, a female companion and all types of incidents until she finally met An Yucheng.</p><br/><p>Interspersed in these moments was the mysterious boy in red.</p><br/><p>He had a top-notch appearance along with an arrogant and noble temperament. He was like a ghost, like a phantom. His sword caused them to feel despair, his glance stopped any rebellious thoughts.</p><br/><p>The investment of two billion yuan definitely wasn\u2019t trivial. The vast majority of the investment was spend on the movie and music effects. It was enough to make the people watching the movie become completely immersed as they really felt the world and these characters.</p><br/><p>At this point, it definitely wasn\u2019t a movie. It was more like a brand new world.</p><br/><p>There was happiness, wanton heroism, abhorrent justice, a sinister demon and the gentle and kind path.</p><br/><p>But in the end, everything turned into a vain dream.</p><br/><p>The audience and heroine made a dream because of jealousy. When they woke up, everything had become so strange, as if they never really knew the world before. Just because of people in authority, just because of manipulations, they never jumped out for themselves and truly lived.</p><br/><p>When Li Ninghan collapsed while shouting, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just wanted to believe them,\u201d the audience\u2019 eyes became hot.</p><br/><p>Yes, she only wanted to believe in her parents. Why did people all over the world say that she was wrong?</p><br/><p>But how could the cold and insulting An Yucheng feel good about this? He covered himself with indifference, making himself strong and calm. But deep in his charming eyes, they were constant doubts and sorrows, reflecting imperceptible tears.</p><br/><p>Li Ninghan didn\u2019t live for herself but did An Yucheng live for himself?</p><br/><p>One person and one sword ended the grievances of the last generation, also pulling them out of the strange circle that bound them.</p><br/><p>An Li, An Li, if they only lived for others, what did their lives mean?</p><br/><p>\u300e My name is Li Ninghan. Although I am from the mountains, I don\u2019t like seeing you under this mountain. \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e An Yucheng had lived more than 20 years. It was the first time he had seen such a free and easy woman. The green hills have a road and white waters flowing. This woman was like a red flower on the green mountains, growing full of thorns. \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e There are 108 factions in the martial arts world and hundreds of martial artists. Since becoming the martial arts leader when I was 16 years old, I have never walked through the north and south of this country. I have never seen the great river. If there was a chance, would I still be the leader? \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e He is the devil! Master, he is the devil! It is him, he killed so many people! It is him!</p><br/><p>\u300e Senior apprentice brother, have you seen my shixiong and shijie? \u300f (Elder apprentice brother and sister)</p><br/><p>\u300e I am no longer An Yucheng, you are no longer Li Ninghan. You are a thorny wild flower in the mountains, I am the rock silently guarding you. Li Ninghan, come with me! \u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e You don\u2019t understand! This is for the deaths of my mother and father! \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e You don\u2019t know! For the past 16 years, I have woken up in the middle of the night and remembered only my master\u2019s eyes that weren\u2019t filled with hate! \u300f</p><br/><p>All these words came to an end with:</p><br/><p>\u300e We clearly agreed to go to the West Lake to see the full moon. Why didn\u2019t you come? \u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>An Li began with a pure and kind girl and ended with an equally pure and kind youth.</p><br/><p>The big world was infinitely prosperous. Who said that the more you had, the greedier you would become? This was just an excuse for despicable actions. If you really had a spacious heart, the bodhi would have no set up and the mirror no stage. How could it turn to dust?</p><br/><p>The sound of crying could be heard after the movie was over.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze pulled the youth\u2019s hand and gently kissed the back of it. He said, \u201cI will accompany you to see the West Lake when it is a full moon.\u201d</p><br/><p>His answer was the youth\u2019s tears and a \u2018good.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Li was well received. Countless film critics returned home from the premiere and started to write their reviews. Whether it was the fine production, the performance of the actors, the touching plot or the depth of the movie, this movie was enough to make people remember it for a long time!</p><br/><p>The next day, this grand event showed no signs of declining.</p><hr/><br/><p>TL: I\u2019ve made a discord group to discuss all my novels, both BL and non-BL.

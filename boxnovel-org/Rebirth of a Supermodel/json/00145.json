Answer= sm_______room</p><hr/><br/><p>Once he woke up the next day, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t feel any pain. Maybe it was because of Xi Ze\u2019s thorough cleaning or perhaps because his body had long become accustomed to it. Ming Xiaoyu just felt some sore muscles but no pain.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was a slight stinging from his rear when he got up from bed.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu became extremely angry once he thought about how that man had bullied him so badly last night. He slapped the head of the shameless man who was still sleeping. \u201cYou are a bastard! Xi Ze, you get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, last night he participated in high-intensity exercise. Xi Ze was still a bit tired and didn\u2019t get up early this morning. Now that his lover suddenly slapped him, Xi Ze slowly opened his eyes and said, \u201cI am here, my little wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu sneered at these words. \u201cYou will be the woman this evening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cIs it the bully grabs the woman only to be oppressed by the woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You come over here and I promise not to kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled. \u201cYou definitely won\u2019t hit me or else you will be murdering your husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026.Who is your husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, who was the one who called out \u2018Husband\u2019 last night? What else did you say? Hurry? Don\u2019t I want to? Hey, am I mistaken?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Snap.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI must beat you to death! I will kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Previously, Ming Xiaoyu said that he would hit Xi Ze anywhere except for the face!</p><br/><p>However, his principle was completely overturned today!</p><br/><p>Where was he hitting? A hit to the face! You are a dead man!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, when the two of them were resting that evening, Xi Ze had a familiar black eye and was cooking for his wife with a \u201c\u25cf\uff3f\ub208\u201d expression.</p><br/><p>As they ate, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s anger disappeared a bit. The two people were grumpy together but continued to do shameless things. After all, they were old virgins and it was so exciting last night. It was hard to taste the sweetness of a new marriage. How could they stop?</p><br/><p>But this evening, Ming Xiaoyu really only did it once before not allowing Xi Ze to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an appointment with Suyi tomorrow to shoot the cover of next month\u2019s issue. I can\u2019t be in a bad state so stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze sighed regretfully at these words but the actions of his hand didn\u2019t stop. He said, \u201cWell, you can sleep. I promise not the take the final step.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would believe this crap?</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu sneered, put on his clothes and hurriedly returned home. As soon as he got home, he immediately locked the door and locked out a hungry man, not allowing him to step inside.</p><br/><p>After a moment, Xi Ze\u2019s text message arrived. \u3010 Is this shyly hiding in the home? \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu snorted. \u3010 I got tangled up by a certain ghost and can only get away from his poisonous hands. \u3011</p><br/><p>Around one minute later, Ming Xiaoyu received a reply from the other party. At this time, he was taking off his clothes and planning to wash himself in the bathroom. He needed to at least clean his body, get some things out from his rear and wash away the sweat.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu had just taken off his coat when he opened the text message and almost dropped his phone.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Oh, I seem to know that ghost. Was it the one who just wrapped himself around my waist shouting \u201cHarder!\u201d? \u3011</p><br/><p>Damn it! I really want to kill you!!!!</p><br/><p>\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b</p><br/><p>Although Xi Ze was a bit black-hearted, he was still very considerate. After the two people exchanged tit-for-tat text messages, he sent a few lewd jokes before saying good night and sleeping in separate beds.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xi Ze was very dissatisfied about the seperate beds.</p><br/><p>Do you think he was the type of person who couldn\u2019t restrain himself? He could definitely hold on and not do anything else!</p><br/><p>However, in the face of Xi Ze\u2019s complaint, Ming Yu dismissed it with a sneer and issued a second house rule\u2014</p><br/><p>\u300e If the owner says something, it is an iron law. For example, if the owner says that Xi Ze is a pig then he is a pig. Rebuttal is invalid! \u300f</p><br/><p>The next morning, Mr. Hungry Ghost took advantage of making breakfast and entered his owner\u2019s door. Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t protest when he saw the delicious food. Luo Ru hadn\u2019t arrived yet so he hurriedly ate the porridge and small dishes.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xi Ze scooped porridge for him and pretended to casually ask, \u201cDear, the food pigs eat is called pig food. What about something a pig cooks. What is it called?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s attention was attracted by the \u2018Dear.\u2019 He was shaking and subconsciously replied, \u201cCan pigs do such a thing? Then it is definitely pig food, hahah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze let out a meaningfully \u201cOh\u201d at the words and didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Once Luo Ru was downstairs and Ming Yu was leaving, Xi Ze walked out with him and said, \u201cIn fact, I think someone who eats pig food is probably\u2026a pig as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes narrowed and he couldn\u2019t respond for a short time.</p><br/><p>Once the elevator stopped on the first floor, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes widened and he grinded his teeth together. \u201cXi Ze, you bastard! You are the pig!! Your whole family are pigs!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoyu, if you say that Mr. Xi\u2019s family are pigs and you are the owner\u2026what are you? Cough. ^\uff3f^</p><br/><p>Thanks to a certain person with the surname of Xi, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s face was dark on the way to Suyi\u2019s headquarters as he sat in the back seat texting. Luo Ru looked thoughtfully at Ming Yu\u2019s appearance and sighed helplessly. \u201cXiaoyu, your skin is really getting better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu felt awkward.</p><br/><p>He just listened as Luo Ru said, \u201cOnce you go Suyi today, the stylists will praise your skin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled slightly as he slowly entered his working mode. \u201cIt is probably because I am young. Sister Luo, your skin is also good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru lightly nodded and didn\u2019t speak again.</p><br/><p>The two of them quickly arrived at Suyi headquarters. As Luo Ru parked the car, Ming Xiaoyu was still texting. He couldn\u2019t help laughing a few times, causing Luo Ru to involuntarily look back at him.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru sighed sadly. What was that saying?</p><br/><p>A woman in love was a fool. You see, people in love were actually really silly!</p><br/><p>Xiaoyu ah, you really don\u2019t know\u2026you are becoming more and more guilty\u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d But it turned out that Luo Ru\u2019s worries were superfluous. Once Ming Yu put down his phone and headed into work, a powerful aura spread out silently, making it impossible for people to not notice the youth\u2019s beautiful appearance.</p><br/><p>It was only when this youth was truly unprepared that she discovered that he was becoming more and more enchanting every day.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru guessed that if it wasn\u2019t for this amazing appearance and temperament, how could he become Xi Ze\u2019s muse?</p><br/><p>After Ming Xiaoyu shot the photos for Suyi, the video of Sixin\u2019s fashion show finished its editing and was officially released.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

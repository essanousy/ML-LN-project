Huaxia Daily had also used this word to describe Cheng Su the previous day, making it easy for people to link them together.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have to guess for two long. The afternoon of the day the newspaper was published, explosive materials were released online. They confirmed that Supermodel C was the one who caused a stir online the past few days and was criticized by Huaxia Daily. At the same time, the reason why Cheng Su was reported was thanks to the people of Chaoyang. (TL: A district in Beijing).</p><br/><p>That night, the police confirmed that Supermodel C was indeed Cheng Su. A white powder found in Cheng Su\u2019s residence had been identified as a drug. The degree of addiction wasn\u2019t high but it was still a drug.</p><br/><p>This time, the Cheng Su fans who refused to let go were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Oh my god, even drugs? This is terrible! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Wasn\u2019t Cheng Su packaged as a handsome and sunny man? Yet he takes drugs? Damn, I\u2019m a passersby turned black! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 What is this false imagine? A few days ago, my friend and I were talking about how hard he worked, how healthy his image is. Yet he is a drug-using health person. Ah, he was laughing at me\u2026 \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s image was already precarious. After the \u2018drug abuse\u2019 incident, a large number of brainless fans turned black and even became sunspots. They were deceived by Cheng Su and now they really hated him.</p><br/><p>Most of the fans were clean people who hadn\u2019t even visited a prostitute. There was no way for them to stick around. Cheng Su\u2019s fans were disheartened and soon threw away all their photos. They also said that they stopped following Cheng Su\u2019s Weibo and Muse\u2019s official fan forum. Even if Cheng Su was released from prison, it was no longer possible to look at him.</p><br/><p>There was a buzz on the Internet. In reality, many newspapers and magazines weren\u2019t as comprehensive as Huaxia Daily. Therefore, they started to sort out the relevant information today in order to publish it tomorrow.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a men\u2019s razor brand endorsed by Cheng Su confirmed that their contract with him had been cancelled and issued a notice on their website.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s reality show also released an official statement that Cheng Su being suspected of taking drugs. Due to Huaxia legal requirements that drug users weren\u2019t allowed to appear on any public platform, the program would edit out all shorts of Cheng Su. This would delay the airing by a week.</p><br/><p>In general, the audience would scold the reality show if it was delayed. But this time, people applauded and supported the program once it was known that the delay was to edit out all footage of Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>\u3010 My daughter previously liked him. I saw his photo and thought he looked quite sunny, so I didn\u2019t stop her. Who knew that this Cheng Su would actually use drugs? It is is disgusting! My daughter has thrown away all his magazines. Thank you to the program for resisting this morally corrupt person! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Such a person isn\u2019t qualified to be a celebrity at all! I saw a TV series a few years ago. It was \u2018XX\u201d a very popular costume drama. I felt that a small supporting role in it was very good and wondered why I haven\u2019t seen him for a few years. The day before yesterday, it was revealed that the small supporting actor had an advertisement with Cheng Su. He didn\u2019t show any special respect for Cheng Su and was ruthlessly suppressed! Cheng Su is a cancer! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Resist this cancer!\u201d The existence of such a person in the fashion industry will make people mistakenly think that the waters are very deep! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A variety of criticisms and mocking appeared on Weibo. In reality, people on the streets, in the fashion industry and in the entertainment industry were talking about it. The platform might be different but everyone was the same. They scolded this bully who dared act self-important and even took drugs!</p><br/><p>Among these people, the angriest were the fans of the models and stars who had been bullied. In particular, the mushroom fans were furious and couldn\u2019t want to eat this scum alive!</p><br/><p>These days, Xi Ze\u2019s fans shared a common link with mushroom fans.</p><br/><p>Bullying Ming Xiaoyu was tantamount to bullying God Xi\u2019s wife! Don\u2019t you think this was a serious problem? Seizing Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s resources and also bullying him. This sin couldn\u2019t be forgiven!</p><br/><p>Cough, Whether it was Ming Yu\u2019s fans or Xi Ze\u2019s fans, no one thought that \u2018Xi Ze is Ming Yu\u2019s wife.\u2019 \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>After all, height determined the attack! Look at the 195cm God Xi and the 188cm Ming Yu\u2026 the height difference wasn\u2019t huge but the feeling of bowing the head to kiss was simply amazing!</p><br/><p>In any case, Cheng Su\u2019s reputation had become stinky and could no longer be cleaned. Apart from people who had no interest in the fashion and entertainment industries, everyone would respond with disdain when Cheng Su\u2019s name was heard.</p><br/><p>As Cheng Su was treated as dirty sewer water by the people, they didn\u2019t know that this target of hate was currently sitting in a police station with a shocked expression. He explained to the police, \u201cI didn\u2019t take drugs, I really didn\u2019t take drugs!\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officer in charge was reminded by his superiors not to treat celebrities with extra care. Therefore, he impatiently hit the table and said, \u201cYou say you don\u2019t take drugs? Then why was it found in your house? The blood test report will come back soon. Don\u2019t even think about lying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was listless at being surrounded by such fierce police officers but he still insisted, \u201cI don\u2019t take drugs. You won\u2019t find anything. I will wait for my agent and my company\u2019s representative to come. Then I am willing to talk to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officer sneered at Cheng Su\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Next, Cheng Su\u2019s blood test clearly confirmed that he didn\u2019t take drugs. However, the police officers didn\u2019t let him go. \u201cThe drugs found in your house should be over a year old. You didn\u2019t take it this year doesn\u2019t mean that you didn\u2019t take it before. Now that we found it in your house, we have reason to suspect that you deal the drug to other people.</p><br/><p>At first, Cheng Su desperately tried to refute it, stating that he didn\u2019t know what the police had found.</p><br/><p>Then the police showed him a photo of a small glass bottle and Cheng Su unexpectedly blurted out, \u201cHow is that thing still here? I clearly gave it to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su hurriedly stopped before he finished. However, the words were already half said. The police veterans understood that Cheng Su had clearly given this thing to someone more than a year ago. He unexpectedly forgot that it was still in his home!</p><br/><p>Hosting other people and giving them drugs was a real crime!</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was stunned but what happened next didn\u2019t allow him to defend himself.</p><br/><p>He waited for Zeng Shu who never arrived. Even his most trusted assistant, Xiao An didn\u2019t come to the police station. Muse only sent a lawyer from the legal department to help solve the problem.</p><br/><p>As soon as the lawyer sat down, he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and smiled. \u201cYou are really special for me to be asked to handle your case personally. Don\u2019t worry, there is no recording when you talk to a lawyer. Feel free to tell me about your affairs and I will consider how to solve this problem for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su didn\u2019t know this gentle and elegant man, but he felt there was something strange about this person\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su didn\u2019t think too much and roughly explained the time and location where he bought this thing. He assured the lawyer that he really didn\u2019t take the drug. The one who took it was Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>The lawyer\u2019s eyes flashed once he heard this. He comforted Cheng Su with a few words before saying, \u201cYou have explained everything clearly. Then I want to ask you, do you want to be imprisoned for five years or ten years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was stunned and couldn\u2019t react to what happened.</p><br/><p>Even if he provided a drug for other people to use, he would at most be sentenced to one or two years. Why was the lawyer speaking so strangely\u2026</p><br/><p>As horror and fear filled Cheng Su\u2019s eyes, the lawyer shook his head helplessly and smiled, \u201cAs I said, you are very special. The company sent me down here to help you deal with this matter. Don\u2019t worry, in my hands, you definitely won\u2019t be able to leave prison for at least five years.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence finished and Cheng Su\u2019s heart sank. He wanted to yell, \u201cI won\u2019t allow you to be my lawyer!\u201d But once he looked into the other person\u2019s eyes that were as cold as a snake, he couldn\u2019t speak a word.</p><br/><p>Yes, he was here to help Cheng Su. Helo him:</p><br/><p>Stay\u2014in\u2014prison\u2014until\u2014the\u2014end!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

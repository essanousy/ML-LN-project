It penetrated through the thick glass of the greenhouse and shone on the blooming flowers. The gorgeous red, elegant white, fresh yellow and elegant purple decorated the greenhouse in a sea of flowers.</p><br/><p>In such a beautiful and magnificent sea, a gentle and handsome young man was slightly bent over and smelling a delicate white lily. He had a handsome and noble temperament, attracting the eyes of everyone who saw him.</p><br/><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t Xi Ze, there was no one who wouldn\u2019t appreciate such a beautiful picture.</p><br/><p>There was a flash of light through Xi Ze\u2019s mind that gave him a fantastic feeling.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had long discovered Xi Ze\u2019s arrival. He was somewhat astonished about why the other person would show up again today, but he didn\u2019t show it. Instead, he slowly put down the lily in his hand and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you come this morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Xi Ze had already restored his expression. His thin lips curved slightly as he moved forward. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t come this afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had already experienced his man\u2019s overbearing and willful nature during the past three days. He wasn\u2019t angry. Rather, he was faintly happy. This showed that the other person really thought of him as a friend, and no longer treated him politely.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu took out a carnation from a vase and asked, \u201cDo you like flowers?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a moment of silence and Xi Ze gently nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this sentence, Ming Yu raised some flowers for Xi Ze to smell, using his opinions as a reference.</p><br/><p>The two people had a tacit understanding while holding the flowers, like they were old friends who didn\u2019t need words.</p><br/><p>By the time they walked towards the end of the greenhouse, Ming Yu was already holding a large bouquet of flowers in his hand. Red, yellow, purple and white decorated the hands of the young man. Ming Yu placed them in a vase and prepared to leave the greenhouse.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to prepare for the spring and summer high-end fashion shows early next year.\u201d The man\u2019s low and magnetic voice rang out in the quiet greenhouse. He paused and continued, \u201cI am afraid I will be very busy in the upcoming months. Do you want tickets for the show?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu held the heavy vase and thought for a moment before asking, \u201cAre you giving me an invitation as a friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou can have two tickets if you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu naturally know the significance of Xi Ze\u2019s promise.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ji and Ya\u2019 held fashion shows four times a year. It represented the world\u2019s top aesthetic standards and often led the fashion trends for this year and the next few years. Many people dreamt of receiving these invitations. However, it wasn\u2019t easy to get even if a person had money.</p><br/><p>Now, Ji and Ya\u2019s chief designer and creative director promised to definitely give him two invitations. There were no traces of exaggeration in these words, but Ming Yu felt like they were too heavy and went beyond the boundaries of friends.</p><br/><p>Thus, he shook his head and said. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t convenient, I will be very grateful for one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people spoke while walking towards the door. They had just arrived at the door when Xi Ze gently sneezed, causing Ming Yu to look over with surprise. \u201cDo you have a cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked closely at the handsome man\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t know when, but a small red dot had appeared at the corner of the left eye. Xi Ze coughed twice, then shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a cold. It is probably a little pollen allergy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu heard these words and suddenly stopped, looking at the man with amazement.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze noticed the youth\u2019s sudden stop and did the same, turning to look at him.</p><br/><p>There was a long silence before Ming Yu slowly sighed and said softly, \u201cSince you have a pollen allergy, you should\u2019ve told me when I asked you to help me select flowers. You didn\u2019t need to help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was very confident in Xi Ze\u2019s aesthetic level and discerning eyesight, so he let Xi Ze help with choosing flowers. But he never would\u2019ve done it if he knew that this man had a pollen allergy.</p><br/><p>In Ming Yu\u2019s mind, Xi Ze wasn\u2019t someone who would hurt himself to help others.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s deep and dark eyes gazed at him before Xi Ze gently nodded and explained. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a very serious allergy. This much contact isn\u2019t a problem, so I didn\u2019t think much of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu replied with some remorse, \u201cIt is my fault so tonight I will invite you to dinner as an apology. I also want to thank you for helping me pick flowers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze naturally didn\u2019t refuse this invitation.</p><br/><p>That evening, the two people had a meal in a random French restaurant. Then Xi Ze took the initiative to send Ming Yu home. It was like any ordinary friends, with Xi Ze not crossing any lines with his behaviour.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu got out of the car, the two people said \u2018goodbye\u2019 and Xi Ze drove away.</p><br/><p>The delicate and cheerful youth stood in the cold moonlight in front of the tranquil apartments, watching the black Aston Martin depart. Ming Yu didn\u2019t look away when the car completely disappeared around the corner, still staring solemnly at where it disappeared.</p><br/><p>Approximately three minutes later, as the cold winter wind blew, the youth turned and walked into his apartment building.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu always believed that this man, like himself, was full of self-confidence and seemingly gentle, but he was actually difficult to get close to.</p><br/><p>In his last life, he had lived at the top of the fashion industry like today\u2019s Xi Ze. Each of their decisions led to many variables, and many crooked people wanted to use them as shortcuts to climb up.</p><br/><p>In this life, Ming Yu had only Zhao Rui and Luo Ru in the ranks of his own people, counting them as friends. The former was really good to him, while the latter was clever and did everything for him.</p><br/><p>But XI Ze, he wasn\u2019t considered under Ming Yu\u2019s category of his \u2018own people.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Yu used to think that this person was very similar to him. The two people should get along, so he agreed to be the other person\u2019s friend. But as he got to know the other person, he found that he couldn\u2019t always take everything calmly and even became childish at times.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this person was his nemesis.</p><br/><p>Originally, Ming Yu intended to keep a distance from Xi Ze when he discovered that this person wasn\u2019t like him. However, this afternoon, when he saw the man who had a red dot on his face because of allergies and even sneezing, he felt the deepest part of his heart softening and he could no longer refuse this person.</p><br/><p>Only he knew how low the possibility was for people like them to harm themselves for the sake of others. Now, Xi Ze did it for him, so Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help being moved.</p><br/><p>Due to this empathy, it was absolutely impossible for Ming Yu to harm Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Ze\u2026 what type of person are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words of the youth were covered up by the thick darkness and no one heard it.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Ming Yu didn\u2019t know that the man who just left the apartment in his car received a call. His agent was urgently begging on his knees on the other end of the phone. \u201cI\u2019m begging you, I\u2019m begging you! Master Xi, Lord Xi, my ancestor! Can\u2019t you come back quickly? This side is almost done and the fashion show is in two months, are you trying to court disaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze listened to Ding Bo\u2019s desperate voice on the phone and whispered, \u201cI will go back tomorrow.\u201d He paused and added, \u201cI won\u2019t leave for a long period of time until this spring and summer show is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was surprised by the unexpected words and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to pursue your muse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze turned the steering wheel and asked, \u201cHaven\u2019t I been pursuing him for the past three days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Ding Bo knew that Xi Ze was pursuing him.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo knew Xi Ze for more than 10 years and had never seen him so devoted to somebody. Xi Ze choose to abandon his job for one person, spending three days to explore his job site.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t his style at all!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t hide his whereabouts, generously letting \u2018Xi Ze came to Ming Yu\u2019s job site every day\u2019 spread through the entire fashion industry and even the entertainment industry.</p><br/><p>What type of behaviour was this? It was him saying\u2014</p><br/><p>\u300e Ming Yu is someone I am taking care of. Before moving against him, please think clearly. \u300f</p><br/><p>Was he mistaken?</p><br/><p>Ding Bo and Shen Xiang never received such good judgment! How lucky was it to be protected under Xi Ze\u2019s wings!</p><br/><p>Not to mention Xi Ze telling Shen Xiang to promote Ming Yu to the highest level in Muse!</p><br/><p>This meant that even if Ming Yu had the strength of a slag, he would be able to smoothly rise in the fashion industry!</p><br/><p>Of course, this was just an example. If Ming Yu wasn\u2019t strong, it wouldn\u2019t be possible for Xi Ze to notice him.</p><br/><p>This might be the case, but it still made Ding Bo feel depressed for a long time. The feeling similar to being \u2018killed on a beach\u2019 made him asked, \u201cYou have been pursuing him for three days. You haven\u2019t obtained the muse, so do you intend to give up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze laughed as if he heard something funny on the phone. Ding Bo was confused for a while, until the man\u2019s low and magnetic voice passed through the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor three days, I have loosened his heart. From now on, he will always remember the name \u2018Xi Ze\u2019 and have placed myself on a different level from others. He didn\u2019t agree to my invitation, but he will be my model sooner or later. After these positive days, there needs to be a cold period. I can\u2019t be a stalker forever. Ding Bo, your cultural standards probably aren\u2019t high enough. Have you ever heard these words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo\u2019s mouth twitched while feeling sorry for the small model in his heart. \u2018You actually provoked such a black-bellied scum.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ding Bo asked, \u201cWhat words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze paused for a moment before saying, \u201cWarm water will boil a frog.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026Ah, I\u2019m really sorry towards Ming Yu. Aren\u2019t you too bad? The other person sees you as a friend, but you are still being calculating. Xi Ze, you really are too heartless. Fortunately, I\u2019ve known you for so many years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing Bo.\u201d The man suddenly interrupted Ding Bo\u2019s words. \u201cWho told you that I don\u2019t see him as a friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was surprised for a moment as he listened to the other end of the phone. Xi Ze sighed and said, \u201cI really do think of him as my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark and enchanting night in the capital. An Aston Martin moved through traffic towards the other side of the city. In the car, the man\u2019s slender fingers gently tapped the steering wheel. The dark red steering wheel and white fingers made a sharp contrast that was difficult to look away from.</p><br/><p>Slowly opening up that young man\u2019s heart? Making the other person his own step by step?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze deeply sighed as he recalled the scene from this afternoon, the young man sniffing a flower with closed eyes.</p><br/><p>In fact, he also felt like it was really difficult to maintain this friendship.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

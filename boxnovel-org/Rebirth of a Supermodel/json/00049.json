For example, changes in the position of subtle highlights, shaping of the eyebrows, etc. were all skills that a good makeup artist were adept at.</p><br/><p>Zheng Qiurong\u2019s status in the fashion industry wasn\u2019t low. She was only 30 years old, but was already a well known first-tier makeup artist of Pei Feng.</p><br/><p>Logically speaking, a makeup artist like Sister Zheng, at the peak of her career, didn\u2019t lack money and fame. Her work wasn\u2019t busy, only being busy around certain periods. It was a quiet and beautiful life that people envied.</p><br/><p>How could such a successful makeup artist be persuaded to leave a second-tier big brand? It was as hard as Lanka or Star Models pulling Shen Xiang from Muse.</p><br/><p>But Luo Ru did it.</p><br/><p>In fact, before Zhao Rui proposed to find a makeup artist for Ming Yu, Luo Ru had quietly been in contact with Sister Zheng. Women always had many small secrets. Luo Ru soon won the trust of Sister Zheng and the two people became close friends.</p><br/><p>As friends, Luo Ru persuaded her friend to give up a stable life and look at the world again. They were friends and she would try to give her friend better treatment.</p><br/><p>The next day, Zheng Quirong came to the Huaxia branch of Nidelan. She was different from yesterday\u2019s makeup artist. She didn\u2019t immediately start Ming Yu\u2019s makeup, but closely observed his face, hairstyle and clothing.</p><br/><p>After looking for a long time, Sister Zheng smiled and lowered her head to Ming Yu. \u201cMing Yu, almost half a year has passed. Your facial features have undergone some changes. Sure enough, you are a young man and are still growing. Your eyes are a little higher than before, I should take note of this.</p><br/><p>Everyone present was surprised by Sister Zheng\u2019s words. They instantly understood. This time, Luo Ru had really dug up an expert!</p><br/><p>It had been almost six months since Ming Yu and Zheng Quirong cooperated. Even then, Zheng Quirong only did a smoke makeup and it took 10 minutes. Yet Zheng Quirong still remembered Ming Yu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>This amazing facial memory, Zhao Rui hadn\u2019t met anyone apart from Zhou Wei Zhuo who had it.</p><br/><p>After that, Zheng Quirong had the assistant put down her makeup case. She moved quickly and swept a variety of brushes over Ming Yu\u2019s face. Sometimes she would smear it with a finger and sometimes her fingers would dip gently. In short, Sister Zheng put down her last brush after a short span of 20 minutes.</p><br/><p>The handsome and elegant youth looked indifferently at himself in the lit makeup mirror.</p><br/><p>The first set of clothing was a pure teenager.</p><br/><p>The word \u2018pure\u2019 wasn\u2019t just limited to beautiful girls. When the young man raised his hair slightly and revealed his white forehead, Luo Ru looked at Ming Yu and\u2026 her heartbeat actually sped up!</p><br/><p>He wore a simple white shirt and tucked the hair on one side behind his head. The makeup was quite simple, making it hard to tell he was wearing makeup. But this youth\u2019s delicate skin, black eyes and slightly thin jaw gave off the feeling of a pure first love. However, this actually made people feel more excited!</p><br/><p>Look at the blushing Luo Ru. \u256e\uff08\u256f\u25bd\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was very satisfied with this makeup. He had seen many superb makeup artists in his life, and Zheng Quirong was just as strong as them! Such a makeup artist willingly staying at a second-tier brand, it was really burying her skills.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thanked Sister Zheng and prepared to leave. He was just about to stand up when Sister Zheng shouted at him to stop.</p><br/><p>It was a familiar scene, Zheng Quirong once again stopping Ming Yu. She carefully looked at his face and finally said, \u201cIt is a pity that there is no mole here. If you don\u2019t mind Ming Yu, can I draw it on you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was stunned for a moment, then he chuckled and nodded. \u201cOkay, I will trouble you to do so, Sister Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Zheng moved her eyeliner point and a small mole appeared at the corner of Ming Yu\u2019s right eye. Sister Zheng was very skilled! This mole was the right size and in the right location. Once the black dot appeared, it made this face become more dazzling!</p><br/><p>Wonderful!</p><br/><p>So beautiful that he couldn\u2019t be ignored!</p><br/><p>After the mole was finished, Ming Yu headed to the studio to meet the photographer.</p><br/><p>The photographer invited by Nideland was Li Desheng, a famous new photographer. He advocated the ability of colour in the performance ability, as well as the composition of the photo. He was involved in Ming Yu\u2019s design and decided to match some colours.</p><br/><p>Li Desheng already had contact with Ming Yu and knew that this teenager was very much in line with the theme of this range of fragrances. But once he saw the boy through the lens, Li Desheng was startled.</p><br/><p>Nidelan\u2019s theme for this series of fragrances: Smoke.</p><br/><p>As an eau de toilette, Smoke was divided into four different categories. It was broken down into Orange Fire Smoke, Orange Green Smoke, White Smoke and Night Smoke. Ming Yu was currently shooting for the White Smoke fragrance.</p><br/><p>Before the photos were official developed, no one knew what the photographer saw. At this moment, Li Desheng saw the scene of a fairy-tale youth slightly squinting at him.</p><br/><p>Li Desheng had a good friend who worked as a photographer at Fashion Entertainment. As you guessed, it was Brother Luo. Li Desheng heard Brother Luo say a long time ago, \u201cMing Yu is a model with a very good temperament. His ability to control the lens is very strong. Many times, you haven\u2019t thought of the next image, but he will directly show you the vague shadow in your heart! It is really great to work with him. It is a photography experience that I\u2019ve never encountered with another model.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Li Desheng\u2019s reputation in the industry was superior to Brother Luo\u2019s. He took photographs of supermodels on the world\u2019s rankings, and understood the \u2018tacit understanding between model and photographer.\u2019</p><br/><p>Before shooting Ming Yu, Li Desheng thought, \u2018This Ming Yu is a very talented person. His sense of the lens is very good and his expressive ability is very strong. However, he is still lacking a little perception compared to supermodels and won\u2019t be able to show the deepest things in the photo.\u2019</p><br/><p>Now Li Desheng regretted his original thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat! Yes, that\u2019s it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, turn around! Right, right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good, one more! Yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In just 30 minutes, Li Desheng had no less than 300 photos saved on his SLR. Fortunately, he recently used the latest memory card. Otherwise, all the photos might not fit on the SLR and he would have to change to a second one.</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu left the studio to change clothes and makeup, Li Desheng quickly copied the photos to his computer. He couldn\u2019t bear to delete any of the photo. The quality was too high!</p><br/><p>Lighting, background layout, perfect styling, the model\u2026</p><br/><p>Full points!</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid to give full points! \uff5e\uff08\u2267\u25bd\u2266\uff09/\uff5e It was the first time that Li Desheng thought that the time for a model to change makeup and clothing was too short. He had only looked through a few hundred photos when Ming Yu appeared again in warm orange clothing.</p><br/><p>This bright colour make the youth seem whiter, his red lips contrasting with the white skin. Li Desheng almost felt himself bend!</p><br/><p>Looking at the dazzling youth in his lends, Li Desheng wiped at his bitter tears. What was this? It was longing for the essence of a person! You tell me. What photographer, who pursued beauty, wouldn\u2019t get a good impression of the youth after meeting such a beauty?</p><br/><p>In this regard, poor Brother Luo and Master Fei\u2019s praise was only worth 32 points!</p><br/><p>Thus, the whole day was spent taking photos. Ming Yu changed into six or seven sets of cloths, and also changed makeups three or four times. No less than 2,000 photos were shot. The number of photos might be a bit high, but the speed of the shooting wasn\u2019t slow.</p><br/><p>It was because the young man gave three different shapes in one second!</p><br/><p>Then why were only 2,000 photos taken in an entire afternoon?</p><br/><p>Li Desheng raised a hand to take the blame. \u2018I couldn\u2019t press the button and adjust the angle fast enough\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>After all the photos were shot, Ming Yu changed clothes and removed his makeup, his work day finally ending.</p><br/><p>Sister Zheng looked at the face clean of makeup and said with a smile, \u201cThe condition of you skin is very good. Ming Yu, it seems like you have been paying attention to moisturizing, very good! I know a male model who always refuses to look after his face. He just says that men don\u2019t need such products, they are only for women.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru listened to these words and interrupted, \u201cAh, male chauvinism.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Zheng looked at her friend. \u201cIsn\u2019t it? He is a model so his face could be considered his meal ticket. Besides, everyone should care for their own body. However, he got retribution for not looking after his face. After two years of makeup, his face became rotten. Now he wants to go back and use those \u2018girly things\u2019, but it is too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru and Sister Zheng started to gossip. Their topic quickly changed from cosmetics to skin care products and then to small and exquisite bags.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu and Zhao Rui helplessly glanced at each other on the side. They understood each other\u2019s meaning. A woman\u2019s mind really couldn\u2019t be understood.</p><br/><p>After tidying up, Ming Yu\u2019s group left Nidelan, ending the full day\u2019s trip.</p><br/><p>Was this the end?</p><br/><p>Wrong!</p><br/><p>The 2,000 photos were just a drop in the bucket. There were still the large posters that would be placed at counters, at subway stations, public transport platforms, movie theatres and big shopping malls!</p><br/><p>In the next month or so, Ming Yu travelled to Nidelan\u2019s Huaxia branch for photo shoots. Many of the Nidelan staff met this young man, with a lot of them asking for his signature.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu signed his name well, fooling many people. They were intoxicated by the beautiful \u2018Ming Yu\u2019 and cried out emotionally, \u201cMing Xiaoyu is too good. He has a good temperament, good appearance and even his writing is good-looking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dog writing Ming Xiaoyu, he hid it deeply.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

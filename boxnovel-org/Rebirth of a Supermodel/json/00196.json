Due to Huaxia\u2019s national strength, its fashion industry was naturally at the top. Countless luxury brands crazily tried to grab at the Huaxia market, some competing to participate in Huaxia\u2019s Fashion Week and the fashion shows.</p><br/><p>In order to resist this phenomenon, the United States started the annual RAmer Charity Gala more than 40 years ago. It announced the importance of this event to the world and invited only some heavyweight guests to attend.</p><br/><p>This was tantamount to suggesting to fashion people around the world that although the American fashion industry might not be as prosperous as yours, you have to come to the RAmer Charity Gala because it was a top feast of fashion!</p><br/><p>This type of behavior was too arrogant.</p><br/><p>Therefore, a few years later, the still relatively young Huaxia fashion industry was led by the Muse Modelling Agency to open a global fashion party. The name was very simple. It was called the Muse Fashion Party. Since the RAmer Charity Gala was held in the middle of each year, the Muse Fashion Party would be at the start of every year. In any case, it was earlier than the RAmer Charity Gala \u256e (\u256f_\u2570) \u256d</p><br/><p>It might seem that people in the world paid more attention to the RAmer Charity Gala than the Muse Fashion Party, but when it came to inexpressible force, the former was worse than the latter.</p><br/><p>The threshold of the RAmer Charity Gala was high but it was a global party. The Muse Fashion Party was based on this, plus an added restriction\u2014</p><br/><p>They must be related to Huaxia.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if they were a foreign model as like as they were the representative of a brand in Huaxia. If it was a global brand, it didn\u2019t matter as long as the global spokesperson was a star of Huaxia.</p><br/><p>In any case, only those with a relationship with Huaxia were qualified to receive an invitation.</p><br/><p>If you were from Huaxia or were a Huaxia brand? Then there was no problem!</p><br/><p>When the Muse Fashion Party took place a year ago, Ming Xiaoyu was only an ordinary second-tier model and wasn\u2019t eligible for an invitation. This time he got the invitation early and it was even personally given to him by Shen Xiang, head of the Muse PR department.</p><br/><p>Half a month ago, the famous top supermodel Xu Rongrong threw an olive branch to Ming Yu and hoped to walk the red party together.</p><br/><p>However, today\u2019s Ming Yu was a person in high demand.</p><br/><p>As early as one month ago, Muse\u2019s sister He Chaoman had already agreed to walk the red carpet with Ming Yu. Therefore, Ming Yu could only regretfully decline Xu Rongrong\u2019s invitation.</p><br/><p>That evening, the eyes of the global media once again focused on the capital of Huaxia. The smooth and curved building and the steel-like reflective material made the conference hall shine like white opals in the moonlight, reflecting a fascinating radiance.</p><br/><p>The red carpet was laid from the red to the end of the artificial lake.</p><br/><p>Like the RAmer Charity Gala, the media could only take photos outside and videos were even banned.</p><br/><p>Tall and dazzling figures walked on the red carpet under the flashes of the cameras.</p><br/><p>Once a luxury BMW slowly stopped at the end of the red carpet, many reporters\u2019 eyes gathered and saw a tall and handsome young man escort a beautiful woman.</p><br/><p>There were many photos of the two of them on the front page of many newspapers and magazines the next day.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman was famous for many years. If it wasn\u2019t for her lacking ambition and her desire to rest at him, it was likely she would be at the top of the female rankings.</p><br/><p>The personal characteristics of He Chaoman wasn\u2019t as clear as Cecilia and Du Ruo. Among the two, Cecilia was ethereal and pure, while Du Ruo was enchanting and eye-catching. Among the top three female supermodels, only He Chaoman had a noble and elegant temperament that people couldn\u2019t forget.</p><br/><p>She was a goddess, a goddess that nobles couldn\u2019t help looking up to.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman\u2019s temperament and appearance were impeccable. But the even more surprising thing was that despite standing next to such a goddess, Ming Yu wasn\u2019t eclipsed at all. The atmosphere between the two people was quite natural, making people feel admiration.</p><br/><p>Since the last time that Ming Yu attended the RAmer Charity Gala, Ji and Ya specifically provided a high-end outfit for Ming Yu. This time no one dared say it was plagiarized. It was because as early as three days ago, this outfit was posted on Ji and Ya\u2019s official website.</p><br/><p>The crimson outfit shone like a gemstone under the lights. The youth wearing this outfit was even more refreshing. Every step caused the string of broken diamonds at his cuff to wave, like a string of silver flowers.</p><br/><p>The intangible field around Ming Yu and He Chaoman as they walked together was even more commendable.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman clearly wore a pair of high heels and her height was almost equal to Ming Yu. However, everyone was surprised to find that in front of this youth, He Chaoman seemed a bit more feminine. When Ming Yu handed a pen to her for the signature wall, she seemed like she was being taken care of by a gentleman and her momentum involuntarily weakened.</p><br/><p>Of course, this wasn\u2019t to say that He Chaoman was lacking. It was just that when these two supermodels stood together, the fierce aura around them made them seem to shine on the same stage.</p><br/><p>In any case, this was a fashion party hosted by Muse. After He Chaoman entered the venue, the next people were Luo Cheng and Xu Rongrong. These two people also had amazing temperaments, but compared to the previous Ming Yu and He Chaoman, everyone found that Luo Cheng and Xu Rongrong were a bit silly.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t to say that Luo Cheng and Xu Rongrong were worse than the Ming Yu pair. But if the latter were noble and cold, the former were gentle and approachable.</p><br/><p>A few of the world\u2019s top stars, supermodels and design masters entered. The final group to enter was the Ji and Ya studio team led by Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>At this point, the entire red carpet was finished. The poor reporters were door but they didn\u2019t give up waiting at the entrance of the venue.</p><br/><p>The party officially began.</p><br/><p>The party might be sponsored by Muse but Du Ruo was the MC. She spoke a few short words and the guests were free. Unlike the RAmer Charity Gala were everyone sat at tables, the Muse Fashion PArty had a free to eat approach.</p><br/><p>All the guests were free to talk and move around. The organizers only invited some stars to give dance and singing performances, as well as issuing several awards to the audience.</p><br/><p>This was one area where the Muse Fashion Party was higher than the RAmer Charity Gala.</p><br/><p>At this party, the World Supermodels Organization would give awards to relevant people in fashion, including the Best Male and Female Model of the Year award, Best Fashion Brand of the Year, Designer of the Year, Best of the Year\u2026. there were always awards for newcomers.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was naturally surrounded by many people in such occasions. This was the first time Ming Yu came to the Muse Fashion Party and he met many colleagues in his company. Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t have stage fright despite it being the first time he attended such a party. He calmly communicated with the other models and designers.</p><br/><p>A handsome youth naturally attracted the attention of others.</p><br/><p>Soon, more and more people came to talk to Ming Yu because they found that it was really good to talk to this youth. Regardless of whether they were a famous designer or an ordinary first-tier model, he would clearly say their names and some achievements.</p><br/><p>Halfway through the party, many people gave this youth the title of \u2018Beauty of the Fashion World.\u2019</p><br/><p>Under a crystal chandelier, Ming Yu held a glass while chatting with others. People who got close to him discovered the beauty of this youth. He not only had a good appearance, he had a way of making people feel good and close to him.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman really lost to this youth when it came to this.</p><br/><p>She might be elegant and graceful but she wasn\u2019t very approachable.</p><br/><p>By the time it was the second half of the party, many people had already spoke to Ming Yu. When some time passed, they would be very comfortable when they left.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Luo Ru helped Ming Xiaoyu collect business card. He had already received nearly 100 cards. Just one of these cards would be enough to make some small models ecstatic, while some fourth or third tier models would be completely overturned.</p><br/><p>But for today\u2019s Ming Yu, these cards were really just business cards.</p><br/><p>He calmly chattered with a Huaxia first-tier director for a while. The other person had just left and Ming Yu couldn\u2019t turn around when he suddenly heard a low voice at his side. \u201cHello Ming Yu, I haven\u2019t seen you for a long time. I saw your latest issue of Edith. It was shot very well.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

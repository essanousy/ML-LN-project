He often teased the guests and staff with a smile, gave brain teasers to test guests or let the guests play Truth or Dare. In short, this was the show\u2019s policy: If Liu Chao wanted you to show something, you have to show it!</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu arrived at the station for the official recording, he noticed that there were only two guests invited for this episode of Liu Chao\u2019s Super Show. The other guest was someone he actually knew\u2014 Wu Yuzhen!</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen was greatly surprised when he saw Ming Yu, but the two chatted quickly and studied the manuscripts given by the program editor. They got familiar with the process and paid attention to some of the key points in the recording process.</p><br/><p>A talk show like this definitely had a manuscript. It could even be said that most television shows had a set of special manuscripts to familiarize guests, allowing unexpected accidents to be avoided.</p><br/><p>In this program, Liu Chao Chao\u2019s manuscript didn\u2019t have a lot to it. In order to allow more jokes, Liu Chao Chao informed guests of a few controversial issues he would bring up. In most cases, the guests needed to play along\u2014</p><br/><p>After all, the point was to create jokes.</p><br/><p>The make-up artist applied light make-up to Ming Yu and Wu Yuzhen, they tidied up the clothing and the talk show recording began. Wu Yuzhen\u2019s fame was higher so he sat closer to the host, while Ming Yu was sitting on the outside.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu recorded many shows in his previous life. He was often present on the famous model series in Europe and the United States called \u2018I am a Supermodel\u2019, to the point where he could be considered a half permanent guests. Ming Yu had recorded many talk shots. He wasn\u2019t as good at making jokes as the host, but it was easy for him to maintain a lively atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen backstage at the Pei Feng fashion show, you actually wore that jacket inside out? How can that be? Ming Xiaoyu, you are definitely kidding right? I heard that Pei Feng\u2019s fashion show has dozens of rehearsals. The designers also use a ruler to measure the distance you have to move!\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, the host Liu Chao immediately pulled down his mouth to make a \u2018panic-like\u2019 look. Coupled with his slightly uneven eyes, a funny effect was created, causing Wu Yuzhen to laugh.</p><br/><p>Early on in the program, Ming Yu reluctantly accepted being called \u2018Ming Xiaoyu.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ming Yu nodded with a helpless expression. \u201cDozens of times? If it really is dozens of times then I must be tired from the stage. But I really almost wore the clothing inside out. There were too many people in the background, everyone was nervous and we needed to take the time to perfect the clothing.\u201d After saying this, Ming Yu paused before turning to Wu Yuzhen with a smile. \u201cSir Wu, I think you must know this more than me right?</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen was surprised for a moment before quickly responding, \u201cYes, it really is busy behind the scenes of a catwalk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only did he not give the host a chance to speak, he took the intiative to throw the topic to another guest.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had always been good at this tactful but not too flattering method. He didn\u2019t want to monopolize the whole show and secondly, Wu Yuzhen was very smart. The two of them were good friends and he was always helpful to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>If he could ensure that everyone had a turn and it was a round table recording, then why not?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu honestly wanted to record a \u2018Hello, everyone is good\u2019 program, but the host Liu Chao was extremely unhappy!</p><br/><p>Who was Liu Chao? The host of a domestically famous talk show!</p><br/><p>His talk show had a \u2018don\u2019t talk about news that breaks a guest\u2019s privacy\u2019 policy, but this was too much!</p><br/><p>Whenever Liu Chao asked about a relatively explosive topic, Ming Yu would lightly deflect the topic, giving a perfect answer. He even jumped in sometimes to help if Liu Chao tried to spring a trap on Wu Yuzhen!</p><br/><p>Where did this person come from?</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t break any news then it was too boring!!</p><br/><p>As Liu Chao became more suppressed, he exchanged a look with the director and laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the life of a model to be so hard! You often have to practice your posture and form every day. It certainly must be very hard! Since Sir Wu and Ming Xiaoyu came to our Liu Chao\u2019s Super Show today, then of course you should relax!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu slightly frowned at these words and the host\u2019s sinister smile.</p><br/><p>Liu Chao clapped his hands and said, \u201cAccording to the old rules, let\u2019s play a brain teaser game! I will suffer a little as your elder brother. Sir Wu and Ming Xiaoyu will be in a group, I will be alone. We will take turns and whoever loses will have to do Truth or Dare!\u201d</p><br/><p>Truth or Dare was a fixed segment of this show. Ming Yu and Wu Yuzhen naturally knew about it, but the didn\u2019t expect this episode to turn out to be the one where Truth or Dare was played.</p><br/><p>Even so, the two people weren\u2019t worried. Ming Yu and Wu Yuzhen exchanged glances before accepting Liu Chao\u2019s proposal to start the game.</p><br/><p>Liu Chao, \u201cMost people in the world are born in what place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen, \u201cBirthing bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201cWhat does Sleeping Beauty fear the most?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chen, \u201cInsomnia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA man with a broken marriage. He grabbed a knife. What does he want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCook for himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat type of grass has the strongest vitality?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne that is easily swayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>The showdown started with \u2018Liu Chao Chao\u2019 vs \u2018Ming Yu and Wu Yuzhen.\u2019 But gradually, Wu Yuzhen started to fall behind the tempo of the other two people, and could only help when Ming Yu\u2019s speed slowed.</p><br/><p>Liu Chao was obviously a sharp hand at brain teasers. Ming Yu and Wu Yuzhen combined weren\u2019t his opponents. After the first failure, Ming Yu chose truth while Wu Yuzhen chose dare.</p><br/><p>A wily smile appeared on Liu Chao\u2019s face. \u201cMing Xiaoyu, please answer. Who do you think is the most handsome person on this stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Ming Yu took out a red note from his pocket. He shook the brand new 100 yuan bill and replied tentatively, \u201cIsn\u2019t Grandpa Mao the most handsome?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chao, \u201c\uff08\u256f\u2035\u2032\uff09\u256f\ufe35\u2534\u2500\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chao: Sir Wu, please hug Ming Xiaoyu for 30 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026So should I lie down while recording?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen reluctantly hugged Ming Yu for 30 seconds and Liu Chao was barely satisfied. In the next brain teaser, Liu Chao ended up being the loser. He was unexpectedly defeated by the \u2018Wu Ming\u2019 combination and could only lament.</p><br/><p>As for Liu Chao\u2019s punishment after choosing dare\u2026 ah, the scene was too bloody. Let\u2019s not mention it.</p><br/><p>After Ming Yu and Wu Yuzhen lost the game a second time, both consciously choose truth for the punishment. They wouldn\u2019t give Liu Chao an opportunity to \u2018punish\u2019 both people.</p><br/><p>However, Liu Chao\u2019s smile became more cunning at this result. He first winked to the director before speaking. \u201cToday is the first day of December. It is also the day that the official supermodel rankings are released. This list was only released one hour ago, so I believe that Sir Wu and Ming Xiaoyu shouldn\u2019t have seen it yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen turned to look at the big screen and nodded with a smile. \u201cAh, we were still recording an hour ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked carefully at the two lists on the big screen. He slightly narrowed his eyes as he looked at the top 10 names on the two lists, finally seeing the first male name listed.</p><br/><p>Liu Chao continued with a smile. \u201cSo, the question I want to ask Sir Wu and Ming Xiaoyu. Out of all the models in the fashion industry, who do you most want to go beyond?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen and Ming Yu were stunned for a moment at this question.</p><br/><p>After hesitating for a moment, Wu Yuzhen calmly replied. \u201cThe person I most want to go beyond is myself. I want to break my own achievements, going forward step by step in a steady manner, as long as I can break through. I think my biggest enemy is myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chao, \u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>That answer didn\u2019t mean anything!</p><br/><p>For the first time, Liu Chao hated that he put forward such a question at all. He could see his bonus for this episode flying away from him on merciless wings.</p><br/><p>Liu Chao didn\u2019t have any hope as he looked at Ming Yu and impatiently asked, \u201cThen Ming Xiaoyu, who do you want to go beyond?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who else could it be. Of course, it is yourself!</p><br/><p>It was such a good response that Liu Chao could naturally answer for Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>However, under the bright spotlight, he saw the handsome young man smile and declare calmly, \u201cThe person I most want to go beyond is Xi Ze.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

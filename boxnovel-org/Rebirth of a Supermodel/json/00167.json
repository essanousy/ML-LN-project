The power of autumn hadn\u2019t reduced, the burning sun shining directly onto the top of people\u2019s heads. It illuminated the asphalt road that seemed it was going to melt and created a layer of bright light on the water.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was protesting as he was pushed out the door by the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis weather, this time! Outside has a lot of sun and many people! You can I can\u2019t be seen together, where can we go? Did you find a private place where two people can sit down? It is better to stay at home!\u201d</p><br/><p>The more the youth thought about it, the more he felt depressed.</p><br/><p>At present, Ming Yu had just entered the list of world supermodels. His shadow wasn\u2019t even seen on the rankings yet Xi Ze had pulled him so openly through the door. If this was snapped by a small reported and published to the public, what could he do?</p><br/><p>Even if Muse took care of the reporters, what about ordinary fans? There were so many people on the streets that they could be seen by others. It would definitely be a problem!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xi Ze and Ming Yu had no intention of disclosing their relationship.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t want to have too much of an impact on Ming Yu\u2019s road to fame due to their relationship. An example was He Chaoman in the past. Due to walking in the high-end Ji and Ya show, she reached the world\u2019s supermodel rankings extremely quickly. This lead many fashion enthusiasts to think that He Chaoman walked in through the backdoor.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when compared to Du Ruo who climbed up step by step with her own efforts, they felt that He Chaoman wasn\u2019t as good as Du Ruo.</p><br/><p>After that, it took He Chaoman two years to conquer these criticisms with her own strength, letting them know that she relied on her strength and not a vague background.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu and Xi Ze thought differently. In Ming Yu\u2019s heart, the things he obtained so far were from his hard work.</p><br/><p>Looking at the entire fashion industry, who would have less than a month\u2019s worth of holidays and who spend most of the time in the news from his jobs.</p><br/><p>He emerged in a second-tier magazine and worked very hard at every step. Therefore, he never feared other people\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>However, Ming Xiaoyu was very concerned about this question. \u201cIf we let other people know about the relationship between us, they might think that you have provided me with many conveniences. If I wanted to do this, I would\u2019ve accepted your invitation at the beginning. I will suffer if I am misunderstood by them right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes, Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t very concerned about going through the backdoor.</p><br/><p>Even those who went through the backdoor were divided into two types: \u2018a really strong person with a backdoor\u2019 and a \u2018complete backdoor.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xi Ze and He Chaoman were examples of the former while Andrew Wallen was an example of the latter.</p><br/><p>At first, Ming Yu refused Xi Ze because he didn\u2019t want to have a relationship with this man. He regarded this man as a competitor. It would be too shameful if he relied on this man to open the path of dominance in the fashion industry.</p><br/><p>Now that the relationship between them was like this, he certainly wouldn\u2019t care about such a little matter. Today\u2019s Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t need any help from Xi Ze. Without the latter, he could still walk very well.</p><br/><p>The more he thought about it, the more Ming Yu didn\u2019t understand Xi Ze\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>It happened to be a red light. Xi Ze put one hand on the steering wheel and turned to look at the youth. He asked, \u201cDo you want to hold hands with me and walk on the street?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden question made Ming Yu\u2019s eyes narrow as he was caught off guard. After a moment, he smiled helplessly and asked, \u201cI already said I was thinking. What is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s beautiful face immediately showed a solemn look. Xi Ze nodded forcibly and said, \u201cSince you really want to, I must meet your wishes. Come on, get out of the car. We will walk hand in hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Xi Ze started to remove his seat belt. He didn\u2019t care that they were still in the middle of the road, waiting for the red light.</p><br/><p>This scene made Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s mouth twitch slightly. The man was really taking off his seat belt. Ming Yu suddenly pressed down on Xi Ze\u2019s hands and asked, \u201cWhat trick are you playing? Don\u2019t you see the green light? This is dangerous. This is the middle of a big road. If something goes wrong, making our relationship public is trivial\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, hot lips stopped the youth\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>By the time Ming Yu recovered, the man had already fastened his seat belt and stepped on the accelerator when the green light came on. The expensive sports car made a buzzing motor sound on the road. Once the car had driven up the street, the youth had a red face as he whispered, \u201cYour sister skills are really advanced\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze solemnly denied it. \u201cI don\u2019t have sister skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze declared in a dignified way. \u201cI only tease Small Mushroom, cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A fist struck the man and Ming Xiaoyu recovered his hand with a satisfied expression. In any case, the air condition inside the car was very comfortable and the sun was blocked by the dark windows. Ming Yu took out a bottle of cold water from the car\u2019s fridge and drank it.</p><br/><p>His leisurely appearance made Xi Ze feel a bit concerned.</p><br/><p>He looked at the youth next to him through the rearview mirror and asked casually, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about us being recognized?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh? Now it is October Golden Week. The capital has many people. If the two of us walk on the streets, at least five out of ten people will know us. You really aren\u2019t worried?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s sentence wasn\u2019t boastful. Huaxia\u2019s fashion and entertainment industries were really prosperous. Don\u2019t talk about his own name and looks. Even Ming Yu, who had a much lower reputation, would have people stopping him for signatures and photos on the streets.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t show any signs of tension at this question. He was very calm as he replied, \u201cIf we are discovered, I will just say that you are the future daughter-in-law of my family. I let you play around outside and now you are picking up the identity of future daughter-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Future daughter-in-law, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Since this young man wasn\u2019t worried at all, Xi Ze didn\u2019t say anything. Once the car turned onto a familiar road, Ming Xiaoyu raised an eyebrow then asked with surprise, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say we were going somewhere? What are we doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made an <i>oh </i>sound and asked with surprise, \u201cWhere did you think I was taking you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu who ate a bitter fruit, \u201c\u2026I thought you were going to take me to a private club or an intimate resort. Who would\u2019ve guessed that you would\u2019ve brought me to Ji and Ya?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, Ming Yu understood the destination of this trip when he saw the elegant Ji and Ya building.</p><br/><p>Ji and Ya\u2019s headquarters was located in the third ring of Huaxia\u2019s capital, surrounded by the world\u2019s major luxury brands. For example, Italy\u2019s top brand Garcia and the US\u2019 top brand Rosalind had built branches in this area. Ordinary first-tier brands couldn\u2019t have a branch here because the area had already been cleaned up by the big names.</p><br/><p>It was like the finance and cooking streets. Fashion brands also liked to be together. When these brands occupied a position in the same area, they stimulated each other\u2019s growth.</p><br/><p>And Ji and Ya had the best position in this fashion street filled with luxury brands.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the last century, Ms. Ji Heya first selected a land and built a ten-story building for Ji and Ya. The building had been rebuilt 10 years ago and now had over 50 floors. It included the jewelry branch, fragrance branch and makeup branch of Ji and Ya. Most important\u2014</p><br/><p>It had Ji and Ya\u2019s high end studio.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu followed Xi Ze and directly entered the special elevator inside the Ji and Ya building. No one discovered their arrival. Here,Xi Ze was even more indifferent than when he was at Muse. He didn\u2019t meet any other people and directly top Ming Xiaoyu to the top floors.</p><br/><p>After all, this was the first time he came to the headquarters of Ji and Ya. It was quite novel for Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>He had been to many high-end studios in his past life. But that China didn\u2019t have their own top brand. Therefore, Ming Yu always had the feeling of being an outsider when he went to those places. It was because everywhere was full of a Western aesthetic. He didn\u2019t want to be nasty but he didn\u2019t like it.</p><br/><p>The same was true for the Garcia studio that he visited in this life.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Ji and Ya held special significance to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>This was Huaxia\u2019s top luxury brand, the world\u2019s first high-end studio, a place filled with the cultural flavour of Huaxia, his lover\u2019s own studio.</p><br/><p>There was a <i>ding </i>sound and the elevator arrived on the 56th floor.</p><br/><p>Before the elevator doors opened, Ming Xiaoyu subconsciously turned to look at Xi Ze. The latter was looking back with a calm smile, countless things filling his deep black eyes. It made the uneasy Ming Xiaoyu instantly relax.</p><br/><p>Yes, this might be the world\u2019s top high-end studio but it was also Xi Ze\u2019s studio.</p><br/><p>Even if the people he was about to meet were the world\u2019s top masters, there was Xi Ze. He believed that these people shouldn\u2019t be too serious and he would get along with them\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Chen! This waist is wrong! Have you changed your reading glasses? What is going on? \uff01\uff08\u30ce\uff40\u0414\u2018\uff09\u30ce!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlice! The colour of your pearls are a problem. Now everyone is half done so it must be changed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201co\uff08*\u2267\u25bd\u2266\uff09\u30c4 hahahaha! I knew that such lines would make it easier to highlight the legs! I have to wait for Xi Ze and show him. This design is so complicated. I studied for half a day before finishing it. Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What about the stereotypes of the strict and serious top masters of fashion?!!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

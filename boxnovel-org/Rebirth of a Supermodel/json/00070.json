Ming Yu had chosen a position in a corner of the restaurant that was covered in green plants, making it difficult for others to see the situation inside. Therefore, his conversation with Du Ruo didn\u2019t receive much attention.</p><br/><p>After a simple meal, Ming Yu ordered a glass of lemonade and Du Ruo ordered coffee. Then the both of them continued to laugh and talk.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo sipped her coffee and asked, \u201cMing Xiaoyu, I noticed something today when the show was filming. Is there a problem between you and Cheng Su? His attitude towards you is very cold and he doesn\u2019t care much about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked up at Du Ruo in surprise at the words.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo looked very charming and glamorous, but she was very generous when dealing with others. This generosity was good and she was very casual. Thus, despite Du Ruo being ranked 3rd out of all the top female supermodels, she was very approachable and didn\u2019t alienate Ming Yu and others.</p><br/><p>This Du Ruo noticed the strange atmosphere between him and Cheng Su?</p><br/><p>Du Ruo smiled like she understood Ming Yu\u2019s meaning and said, \u201cNo matter what, I am a woman. It is natural that I know more about matters of the heart than men. Then Ming Xiaoyu, have you encountered trouble with Cheng Su?\u201d</p><br/><p>Trouble?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s lips curved as he secretly thought, \u2018How could this be described as trouble?</p><br/><p>This was simply a bloody vengeance!\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t understand the grief and fury behind the original owner\u2019s actions, but the original owner wanted to teach Cheng Su a lesson. Ming Yu had to do this.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo was from Lanka Modelling Agency and wasn\u2019t aware of Muse\u2019s internal affairs. It was estimated that she would only know Xi Ze, He Chaoman, Luo Cheng and several other top Muse models. And even if Du Ruo was a Muse model, she wouldn\u2019t have known about Cheng Su and Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>It was like the general manager of a company suddenly being concerned with the dispute between two small executives in a certain department\u2026</p><br/><p>It was too much!</p><br/><p>But Ming Yu didn\u2019t directly answer Du Ruo. The handsome youth revealed a charming smile. Then Ming Yu shook his head and said, \u201cActually, there is nothing serious between me and Cheng Su. Sister Du, you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Ruo raised an eyebrow thoughtfully at the words and didn\u2019t proceed with the topic.</p><br/><p>They chatted together for a while before returning to their room upstairs to prepare for the next day\u2019s recording.</p><br/><p>Telling other people, especially Du Ruo, the conflict between himself and Cheng Su?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu would never do that.</p><br/><p>First of all, he wasn\u2019t familiar with Du Ruo, they had only known each other for one day. Secondly, it wasn\u2019t right to talk about others behind their backs. This was taboo in the industry. Du Ruo wouldn\u2019t ask so casually if she really cared. Thus, he sensibly chose the \u2018neutral\u2019 option.</p><br/><p>However, the next morning, Ming Yu had just woken up and was eating breakfast in the dining room. Suddenly, Luo Ru leaned close ti him and quietly said, \u201cXiaoyu, Cheng Su\u2019s endorsement for Rayleigh Cano came out yesterday. The domestic major counters and some advertising billboards were changed to his posters. Now Cheng Su is a hot topic in Huaxia.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Luo Ru said this, Ming Yu saw Cheng Su and his assistant walk into the restaurant. Cheng Su\u2019s mood today was obviously very good. He didn\u2019t notice Ming Yu, but Ming Yu looked at him for a long time with narrowed eyes.</p><br/><p>His mood was so good. It seemed like he knew what was happening in Huaxia?</p><br/><p>After Cheng Su\u2019s endorsement went live yesterday, Zeng Shu immediately took the opportunity to contact the major media and issued a press release. He also hired some navy to create a hot topic on the Internet.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu directly passed 90 points and scored 100 points. Once Luo Ru told this to Ming Yu, he expressed his appreciation for Zeng Shu\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>But after the appreciation, Ming Yu shook his head and asked, \u201cSister Luo, did his endorsement really go online yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru also sighed. \u201cYes, it was just yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them looked at each other and smiled helplessly.</p><br/><p>Yesterday, Zhao Rui saw that Ming Yu\u2019s shooting process was very good and returned home to deal with other things. If Zhao Rui was present today, he wouldn\u2019t be acting as calmly as Ming Yu and Luo Ru. Rather, he would be shouting in horror. \u201cHow did Zeng Shu calculate the timing? It came online one day earlier than our \u2018Smoke\u2019 perfume!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, this evening, Ming Yu\u2019s endorsement of the \u2018Nidelan Smoke\u2019 perfumes would be launched in Huaxia.</p><br/><p>But Ming Yu\u2019s helpless smile wasn\u2019t due to giving up. It was because he felt that Cheng Su unexpectedly colliding with him would end up with Cheng Su\u2019s sadness.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t believe in Cheng Su. Rather, Ming Yu believed in Nidelan\u2019s PR methods and his own strength.</p><br/><p>During the recording of the show, Cheng Su was still indifferent to Ming Yu despite being in vigorous spirits. Ming Yu was the same as the previous day, focusing on playing games and shooting the program.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu and the director had probably made an agreement. During the second day of shooting, the director specifically gave a lot of highlights to Cheng Su, making him the most shining presence. On the other hand, Du Ruo didn\u2019t care about such things. She simply smiled at Ming Xiaoyu with a deep look in her eyes, making him feel creeped out.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo\u2019s biggest reason for participating in this program was entertainment and leisure. She somewhat had a desire to enter the entertainment industry. However, she was still thinking about it and chose this reality TV show to test the waters. Du Ruo still wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to cross this line, so she just played the games. There was no other meaning.</p><br/><p>The first day of filming made Du Ruo quite interested. On the second day, Du Ruo became keenly aware of the program\u2019s atmosphere shift towards Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>This made Du Ruo feel curious. \u2018Ming Xiaoyu, what would you do?\u2019</p><br/><p>Du Ruo didn\u2019t believe Ming Yu when he said there was nothing big between him and Cheng Su. If there was nothing big, why would Cheng Su secretly look at him with those cold eyes? Even Zhao Rui wouldn\u2019t believe it (Wait, Du Ruo didn\u2019t know Zhao Rui)!</p><br/><p>But some people, even if you didn\u2019t want to provoke him, he would rush to provoke you!</p><br/><p>In the \u2018Quick Reply\u2019 game recorded in the afternoon, all the invited guests were models from the fashion industry. Therefore, the director announced that the questions would be related to the fashion industry.</p><br/><p>As soon as these words were heard, the group consisting only of the regular guests protested. \u201cDirector! Don\u2019t be so shameless! Each of the three groups has a model. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s group has two! It isn\u2019t fair to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Instead of waiting for the director to answer, Du Ruo raised a hand and said with a laugh. \u201cI believe in Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s strength. I won\u2019t answer any questions, how about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group\u2019s eyes immediately shone and they quickly agreed to Du Ruo\u2019s proposal.</p><br/><p>Who was Du Ruo? Ming Xiaoyu, Cheng Su and Liu Qian couldn\u2019t be compared to her!</p><br/><p>Removing this golden thigh, it was a great benefit!</p><br/><p>As for Ming Xiaoyu\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Xiaoyu, Sister Du believes in your strength. You should take first place, haha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\uff08\u2192\uff3f\u2192\uff09\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this pushing him to the edge of a mountain?</p><br/><p>The game was set up for the participants to rush to answer. After the final answer, the team with the lowest score would receive a terrible punishment while the first, second and third place teams would get different number of points.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo just casually said that Ming Xiaoyu should take first. She had no idea that his child could do it at this level. Before half the questions had been asked, their score had already left the other teams far behind.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo, \u201c\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u201c\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t you give us some room to live?</p><br/><p>Once the game was halfway through, Ming Yu\u2019s group had 54 points, Liu Qian\u2019s group had 12 points, Cheng Su\u2019s group had 14 points and the last group simply gave up. They straightforwardly received 0 points.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s score was too exaggerated. This could create a first-class program effect. However, the director considered it before adding a lot of questions that Cheng Su must know.</p><br/><p>The speed at which Cheng Su pressed the answer button wasn\u2019t slower than Ming Yu. Slowly, Cheng Su\u2019s score caught up to Ming Yu\u2019s by the time the game was almost over. There was only a one point gap between them.</p><br/><p>There were two questions left. Thanks to the program\u2019s assistance, Cheng Su looked at Ming Xiaoyu with a lot of confidence, sending him a provocative look. In this regard, Ming Xiaoyu looked down at his fingers and didn\u2019t pay Cheng Su any attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second to last question is here! Excuse me! The famous French model Alice Crandall. In 2014, which brand of perfume did she endorse?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeep\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeep\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>The two sounds were heard at the same time! The host looked at the time, gritted his teeth and looked at Cheng Su. He said, \u201cCheng Su pressed the button first. Cheng Su, do you know the answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this, it was obvious that Ming Yu was the first to press the answer button. HIs eyes slightly narrowed and there was a touch of a dangerous smile on his face.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Cheng Su had simply thought about pressing the answer button. Now that he was asked this question, he suddenly stopped and paused for a long time before answering tentatively. \u201cThe brand\u2026 is it the French \u2018Cherilt?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>The host heard this and looked at Cheng Su for a long time with surprised eyes. This surprised appearance made Cheng Su mistakenly think he was right. Thus, he smiled confidently and said, \u201cI know this type of thing. I have read reports related to Cherilt every year.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice wasn\u2019t loud, but it entered straight into Ming Yu\u2019s ears with a smug pride.</p><br/><p>But after Cheng Su finished speaking, the host made a strange expression and cried out, \u201cCheng Su, the answer is wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su had just turned his head to see what the boy beside him look like. But he had only half turned when he heard the host\u2019s words. Cheng Su\u2019s eyes widened with surprise and he looked incredulously at the host. Then he quickly restored his expression and said, \u201cI probably remembered wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Ruo sneered and whispered, \u201cDidn\u2019t he say that he paid attention to Cherilt\u2019s news every year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled without speaking.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the host sighed and looked at Ming Yu. \u201cNow, Ming Xiaoyu, do you know what the answer is?\u201d</p><br/><p>At these words, everyone\u2019s eyes focused on MIng Yu. In particular, in Cheng Su\u2019s eyes, the youth seemed to give off a complex and deep atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Under the eyes of the crowd, the handsome youth\u2019s lips curved. The sun shone on his hair, giving it a golden tone as he calmly replied, \u201cThe famous French model Alice Crandall. In 2014, she endorsed the perfume called the \u2018Dream Series\u2019 and the brand is\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRayleigh Cano.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This type of stupid thing\u2026err, was there anyone in all of Huaxia who would do it?</p><br/><p>Once Jiang Kaiyang was in the air, there were only two possible endings. The first was that he would accidentally bump into something and his injuries would worsen, making the consequences more terrible. The second was that he was rescued. Nothing would go wrong but his leg would still be broken.</p><br/><p>However, if Ming Yu came out to save him, no matter which of the above outcomes occurred, there would inevitably be another result.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu would also become injured.</p><br/><p>This was inevitable. He was a small mushroom, not a bamboo wearing a parachute. Even if Ming Xiaoyu was a bamboo, he would be wearing a mushroom hat, not a parachute\u2026cough, it was getting off-topic. Let\u2019s return to the subject.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze clearly understood the process of things from Ding Bo while Ming Yu was unconscious. The only thing he couldn\u2019t understand was why Ming Yu suddenly rushed forward and pulled Jiang Kaiyang to him, paying such a heavy price.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly a few seconds had passed. I was closest to him and Jiang Kaiyang kept shaking. The other staff didn\u2019t dare approach him. Only I was near him, so there was no problem.\u201d Ming Yu paused at this before adding, \u201cDespite how confident I am, I know I am a newcomer in this area. I wasn\u2019t conceited enough to try and save Jiang Kaiyang. It might make both of us become seriously injured. But at this time, something happened to make me take action.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was a complete newbie when it came to wires. After Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s accident, his first action was to quickly unleash his own wires and take the initiative to stay away from this dangerous area, letting the professionals work.</p><br/><p>The moment he tried to do this, he discovered that his wire was entangled with JIang Kaiyang\u2019s!</p><br/><p>While Jiang Kaiyang was dangling, his wires kept tangling with Ming Yu\u2019s wires. The winding action was too fast. Ming Yu had just released the first lock on the wire when he felt his body being pulled in Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s direction!</p><br/><p>In \u2018the time needed to release the wire\u2019 and \u2018time to be dragged by Jiang Kaiyang\u2019, Ming Xiaoyu could only ponder for a second. He immediately made a decision. Jiang Kaiyang had to come down immediately!</p><br/><p>Otherwise, he would definitely collide with Jiang Kaiyang before he could unlock his wire.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Ming Xiaoyu immediately moved towards Jiang Kaiyang and embraced him, forcibly pulling Jiang Kaiyang towards him. At the same time, he loosened his right arm and placed it behind his head in order to prevent a fatal injury. Finally, he tapped his legs gently against the wall to act as a buffer.</p><br/><p>As a result, today\u2019s scene was created.</p><br/><p>It could be said that in the entire An Li crew, only Ming Yu could be so decisive.</p><br/><p>He minimized the damage to the other party while maximizing his own safety. It could be said that Ming Xiaoyu was very smart and rational. If Luo Ru or Ding Bo had heard this explanation, they would feel sincerely thankful. However, Xi Ze immediately frowned when he heard these words.</p><br/><p>The cold and elegant face revealed a solemn expression as Xi Ze said without hesitation, \u201cYou should\u2019ve pressed the emergency button.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was surprised by the words for a moment. Then he said, \u201cIf I pressed the emergency button, the wires would be even harder to control. I would be safe but Jiang Kaiyang\u2026\u201d The voice of the young man gradually subsided as he saw the man\u2019s deep eyes.</p><br/><p>The two people looked at each other for a long time before Xi Ze\u2019s lips thinned and he said indifferently, \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t die. An air cushion was placed below. At the most, he would break the other leg.\u201d Xi Ze bowed his head and said earnestly, \u201cEven so, you won\u2019t be hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu stared deeply at the man before him without opening his mouth.</p><br/><p>Then after a moment, he laughed and said, \u201cXi Ze, you are so unreasonable. If Jiang Kaiyang knew this, he would curse you. Jiang Kaiyang really would have to spend months in a wheelchair if he broke the other leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>This might be the case but Ming Yu didn\u2019t deny Xi Ze\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t a person who would sacrifice himself. Looking back now, his decision was really a bit risky.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s outcome was the best result that he imagind. He only injured his hand and just needed to rest for a period of time. Jiang Kaiyang also only broke one leg.</p><br/><p>But what if things hadn\u2019t turned out as well?</p><br/><p>The worst outcome was that Ming Yu didn\u2019t have time to protect his head with his hand and it would forcefully hit the wall. This type of trauma could be very big or small. The slightest hit to the head would cause bleeding and if it was serious\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it again.\u201d Xi Ze suddenly hugged the youth\u2019s body and spoke with some fear. \u201cIn my eyes, your life is more important than anyone else. Even your fingernails are more important than that Jiang\u2019s legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu laughed. \u201cHis name is Jiang Kaiyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze murmured lightly, \u201cWhat is a name in front of love?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people exchanged a few words and Xi Ze\u2019s anger lessened. He personally cut an apply and handed it to Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour scenes in H City has already finish. Wait for your legs to become better and then we will return to the capital. This place isn\u2019t good to rest. I don\u2019t have anything to do for a while so I will take care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ming Xiaoyu bit the apple in his left hand and asked, \u201cDid Jiang Kaiyang really only break one leg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze licked his lips when he heard the name and didn\u2019t feel good.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he is lucky. Breaking only one leg is a good result.\u201d</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t want to continue this topic. As a doctor changed the bottle of glucose, Xi Ze talked about the Ji and Ya high-end fashion show with Ming Yu. Once Ming Yu was a little tired, Xi Ze helped him with his waist pillow and gently picked up the right hand on the quily.</p><br/><p>The thin and beautiful hand was now wrapped in a thick bandage. The doctor had put a lot of ointment and powder on it to prevent inflammation. Fortunately, the wound was blocked by the bandage. Otherwise, Xi Ze was afraid he would be tempted to do something as soon as he saw the youth\u2019s bruised hand.</p><br/><p>For example, he would get revenge on the person who made Ming Yu\u2019s hand like this.</p><br/><p>As if perceiving his thoughts, Ming Yu\u2019s lips gently curved and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It was very painful when it was hit but now I don\u2019t feel anything. My relationship with Jiang Kaiyang isn\u2019t good but he didn\u2019t make things difficult for me. We have a normal relationship so don\u2019t go finding the other person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze hummed lightly. He didn\u2019t deny or agree to it.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s body was injured and easy to feel fatigue. He slowly fell alseep.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze silently watched the youth\u2019s quiet and restful sleep. Then Ding Bo gently knocked on the door and indicated for him to come out. Xi Ze crept out of the room and silently closed the door.</p><br/><p>Once the door closed, Ding Bo asked directly, \u201cWhat are you doing to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. After a long time, he replied, \u201cI won\u2019t do anything. The matter should be pressed down for the moment. It wasn\u2019t a major event between the two parties so you should discuss it with Jiang\u2019s manager. It would be good if this doesn\u2019t become bigger than it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was slightly stunned. He looked at Xi Ze for a long time. \u201cThis method of handling it really isn\u2019t your style Xi Ze. Are you thinking about Ming Yu\u2019s reputation and his future development?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was noncommittal.</p><br/><p>However, Ding Bo suddenly sighed. \u201cIt is rare that you are so good-hearted. Unfortunately Xi Ze, we won\u2019t be able to cover up the problem this time. Half an hour ago, Jiang Kaiyang posted a message on his Weibo and now the whole Internet is arguing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s phoenix eyes narrowed and he asked in a dangerous tone, \u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>A ridiculing smile appeared on Ding Bo\u2019s face. \u201cThey are noisy. Jiang Kaiyang has so much filming experience and is good on the wires. How is there suddenly an accident when he played opposite Ming Yu? In addition, only Jiang Kaiyang got injured. What did Ming Yu do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo\u2019s expression became more serious. \u201cWell, I prettied up the argument but this is what most of Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s fans are saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Yu is the one who caused our Jiang\u2019s leg to break! The culprit must be Ming Yu! \u3011 It stood to reason that fans would become anxious after hearing that their idol\u2019s leg was broken. In any case, the accusations were strong. Since the truth of the matter wasn\u2019t announced, all responsibility was pushed to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Why was there such a dramatic event happening?</p><br/><p>It was actually very simple. It was because Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s assistant borrowed his Weibo account and sent this message:</p><br/><p>\u3010 Jiang Kaiyang: In the afternoon, Jiang Kaiyang was filming An Li and experienced an accident with @Ming Yu, leaving Jiang Kaiyang dangling from the wire. Now Jiang Jiang\u2019s right leg is confirmed to be fractured and he is being treated in hospital. He still isn\u2019t awake! Jiang Jiang has been shooting this film for a long time and is very dedicated. I hope you will support Jiang Jiang! \u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It could be excellent designs, or an outstanding model.</p><br/><p>Although Xi Ze rarely appeared in fashion shows in recent years, mostly only for his own brand, many top international players continued to throw him an olive branch.</p><br/><p>Why was that?</p><br/><p>It was because as long as Xi Ze was there, it would definitely be a stunning fashion show!</p><br/><p>This time, Yang Kangzheng got that same feeling.</p><br/><p>It was a second-tier fashion show and there were a few first-line model. Some might become supermodels, but Yang Kangzheng didn\u2019t get that feeling from every supermodel.</p><br/><p>However, today he was looking forward to a strange young model.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s position on the catwalk was third last, he was followed by another first-tier model and Cheng Su. Once it was his second appearance on the stage, the clicks of the shutters were immediately heard from the audience. It was almost overwhelming.</p><br/><p>Many reporters and editors didn\u2019t react to Ming Yu\u2019s first appearance. Now they were well prepared and got quick shots of this remarkable teenager. Yang Kangzheng raised his SLR to take a few photos, then he appreciated the denim clothing on Ming Yu\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The deep blue denim gave off a youthful atmosphere and wrapped tightly around the youth\u2019s slender legs, outlining the beautiful curves. Ming Yu had an indifferent expression with no fluctuations at all. He seemed to be drifting away from this world, his calm eyes gazing in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u2018How could this child be unknown?\u2019</p><br/><p>This thought flashed through Yang Kangzheng\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu arrived in front of Yang Kangzheng, his gaze shifted to Ming Yu\u2019s side. The flashing lights meant that Yang Kangzheng couldn\u2019t help seeing the face of the man sitting opposite him.</p><br/><p>Yang Kangzheng was startled. He looked carefully at Xi Ze, but his face was once again hidden by the dim lighting of the venue.</p><br/><p>But the reason why Yang Kangzheng was startled!</p><br/><p>As the chief editor of a first-tier magazine, Yang Kangzheng had some interactions with Xi Ze. He was acutely aware that although Xi Ze was a polite gentleman, he was also proud and solemn, with a very high vision. Therefore, his appreciation towards anything was rare.</p><br/><p>This type of personality was very difference, but it was normal in the fashion industry where all types of strange personalities gathered.</p><br/><p>Now Xi Ze was smiling as he looked at that model.</p><br/><p>He was smiling?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, what was he smiling at?</p><br/><p>Yang Kangzheng\u2019s thoughts became very tangled, while Ding Bo looked at Ming Yu several times in a meaningful manner. Then he turned towards Xi Ze and said, \u201cMing Yu\u2019s walk is pretty good. I can\u2019t believe that he has the aura to dominate a live audience.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ding Bo said this, it was the finale and the audience should be focusing on Cheng Su. However, Ding Bo turned away from the sight.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo thought for a moment and said, \u201cThis Ming Yu has the potential to enter the supermodel list!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the unexpected words, the handsome and indifferent man\u2019s lips suddenly curved. He lightly looked over Ding Bo and asked, \u201cHe has potential?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he has potential?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the dim lighting of the venue, Xi Ze shook his head. \u201cThe new supermodels list will be released next week, so he can\u2019t catch up. However, perhaps after three more, you can see his name on the list.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo gasped and looked at Xi Ze with great astonishment.</p><br/><p>He asked \u201cWhy are you so optimistic about Ming Yu? He will be able to enter the list after three more turns? You must be joking, Xi Ze.\u201d The man was too lazy to respond until Ding Bo asked, \u201cWhat will you do if Ming Yu doesn\u2019t appear on the rankings.\u201d Xi Ze looked at him and said, \u201cShut up. Watch the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was the one to provoke the curiosity of others first!</p><br/><p>At this point, it was the third round of the fashion show and the female models had just finished, leaving only the male models left. Ding Bo carefully continued to appreciate the fashion show when he suddenly heard a deep voice in his ears, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t enter the rankings in three turns then\u2026 my itinerary that year, you can freely arrange it and I will accept everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo: \u201c\uff5e\uff08\u2267\u25bd\u2266\uff09/\uff5e Remember you said this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s supermodel rankings were divided into the top 100 male models list and the top 100 female models. It was updated once every three months by the World\u2019s Supermodel Organization based on the supermodel\u2019s global influence, endorsements, fashion show, annual income and other data for personal valuation.</p><br/><p>Basically, the top ten on the list rarely changed and there were hardly any changes in a year. The ups and downs of the top 50 were usually small. Then for the last 20, there were occasionally a few dark horses. As for whether these dark horses will be short-lived or rise, it depended on their strength.</p><br/><p>An unknown newcomer who could enter the world\u2019s top 100 rankings in three turns, Ding Bo had only seen a few people with such arrogant and domineering progress. One was the Muse Company\u2019s Luo Cheng and another was Sister He Chaoman.</p><br/><p>Now Xi Ze was rating Ming Yu above Luo Cheng and He Chaoman?</p><br/><p>This was too exaggerated!</p><br/><p>Ding Bo didn\u2019t think too much and focused on being able to freely organize a person\u2019s schedule for a year. He might not look it, but Xi Ze was simply too lazy! A fashion show once every six months was already rare. His normal frequency was once a year!</p><br/><p>This guy was still the company\u2019s largest shareholder, so Ding Bo couldn\u2019t move him at all!</p><br/><p>Why hadn\u2019t he been pulled down the rankings yet?</p><br/><p>Ding Bo secretly thought.</p><br/><p>Nobody knew the nasty thoughts in an ace agent\u2019s mind as the fashion show entered the final part.</p><br/><p>Pei Feng\u2019s autumn fashion show was a clothing conference, the finale model might by Cheng Su but it was normal for the other models to look more amazing. Ming Yu\u2019s previous two appearances made Yang Kangzheng feel very surprised, but Yang Kangzheng couldn\u2019t help clapping at the light grey jacket of his last appearance.</p><br/><p>At this point, the audience clapped for the first time.</p><br/><p>Many industry professionals couldn\u2019t help expressing their praise with applause, both at the clothing and this catwalk.</p><br/><p>Clothes and models were always complementary, this model showed off the beauty of the clothing so he deserved this applause!</p><br/><p>As for the finale model, Cheng Su\u2026?</p><br/><p>It was like nobody noticed his existence.</p><br/><p>Who let him walk so closely to the most amazing model? By the time people thought about Cheng Su, he was already gone.</p><br/><p>There was a solemn silence for three seconds.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At this time, Pei Feng\u2019s autumn 2016 fashion show came to an end.</p><br/><p>Yang Kangzheng and many other media outlets hurried to get an interview with Xi Ze, but they found that he had disappeared from his seat along with his agent.</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He ran as quickly as always!</p><br/><p>Anyway, today\u2019s protagonist was Pei Feng so it was good if they interviewed Pei Feng.</p><br/><p>At this time, the fashion show was completely over, so Ming Yu\u2019s task could be considered finished. The interviews were regarding Pei Feng\u2019s internal matters and had no relation with the models. So, Ming Yu would lave the venue first with Zhao Rui and Luo Ru after taking off his make-up.</p><br/><p>While removing the makeup, Sister Zheng had complimented Ming Yu\u2019s performance and he thanked her.</p><br/><p>However, after cleaning off his make-up and changing clothes, a familiar figure blocked Ming Yu\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui felt stuffy, while Luo Ru narrowed her eyes and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>As for Ming Yu?</p><br/><p>He smiled and asked, \u201cMr. Cheng. I am about to leave. Did you need something?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s attitude was neither overbearing or intimate. It was like he was talking politely to a stranger. Cheng Su looked at this familiar face and felt strange. He noticed that something had completely changed, but he didn\u2019t understand exactly what it was.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was really handsome and his body was also very good. At 187cm tall, Ming Yu needed to slightly look up at him. However, this height didn\u2019t necessarily represent momentum. In this scene, it was the youth controlling the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su looked at Ming Yu for a while before extending his right hand and speaking dully. \u201cYou performed very well. Congratulations Ming Yu, your progress is great.\u201d</p><br/><p>A touch of surprise crossed Ming Yu\u2019s eyes as he heard this. However, he instantly covered up the emotions and shook Cheng Su\u2019s hands. \u201cThank you for your praise. Your performance was very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Since it seemed like Cheng Su had nothing more to say, Ming Yu spoke again. \u201cMr. Cheng, I will go first.\u201d Then he left with Zhao Rui and Luo Ru.\u201d Cheng Su looked at his disappearing back and slowly clenched his fists.</p><br/><p>Who was the one most able to feel the atmosphere of the show?</p><br/><p>It was the model walking on the catwalk.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su walked behind Ming Yu so he could naturally see Ming Yu\u2019s performance. He was also aware that he was being oppressed. But it was absolutely impossible for Ming Yu to grow eyes in the back of his head and to see Cheng Su\u2019s state.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your performance was very good,\u2019 he had said.</p><br/><p>So, Ming Yu\u2026 are you mocking me?</p><br/><p>The handsome man narrowed his eyes in a dangerous manner, and his nails gradually embedded in the palm of his hands. However, when someone came to speak with Cheng Su, he looked bright and cheerful without any signs of displeasure.</p><br/><p>While Cheng Su was feeling anger and resentment in his heart, Ming Yu, Zhao Rui and Luo Ru were walking to the parking lot when they were stopped again. This time, Ming Yu\u2019s face wasn\u2019t indifferent. He was somewhat surprised to see the woman with a beautiful appearance.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru raised her glasses with surprise, while Zhao Rui exclaimed, \u201cFei Sixin?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The first photo he released on Tianya was very vague, making people feel doubt.</p><br/><p>However, the nine photos he later released were completely without any doubts!</p><br/><p>It was still a sneak shot from far away and the clarity wasn\u2019t high enough for the features to be seen, but the online was clearly revealed. At the same time, there seemed to be a light in the distance. In the fifth photo, the headlights lit up the two people, making it absolutely impossible to deny their identities!</p><br/><p>\u3010 It really is Mushroom and God Xi\u2026 really Mushroom and God Xi\u2026 really Mushroom and God Xi\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu and God Xi are really handsome. These blurred photos like so beautiful. The side face is beautiful and these photos are really beautiful! \u2026Well, I seem to have gone a bit off track but they are really beautiful! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 No matter what the relationship between Ming Yu and Xi Ze is, I want to ask @Rising Supermodel is Gay, do you discriminate against homosexuality? In front of all the netizens, you dare say that you discriminate against homosexuality? Gay marriage is about to be legalized. Why are you discriminating against homosexuality? I am a homosexual. I\u2019m not a fan of these two people. But since you say that homosexuality is disgusting and that they are disgusting, I must stand up and defend our interests! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>All types of words instantly filled the screen.</p><br/><p>Not even an hour had passed and the #Xi Ze Ming Yu# topic reached the top of the popular Weibo list! At the same time in Tianya, someone posted the nine photos and the post instantly shot to the hottest post of the day, hottest of the week and even third hottest of the month!</p><br/><p>In today\u2019s world, the popularity of the fashion industry wasn\u2019t as high as the entertainment industry. However, it wasn\u2019t far behind. Beautiful and handsome models were always the focus of attention.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze had long been popular to the north and south of Yangtze River. Ming Yu was a super newcomer with high exposure in the past two years. The combination of these two people caused a fierce explosion.</p><br/><p>For a time, fans were rioting and the fashion lovers were rioting. Even the passersby couldn\u2019t help taking a look at what was going on.</p><br/><p>The 10 photos were extremely important to human life.</p><br/><p>Apart from the fans who were mad because they didn\u2019t accept homosexuality, most fans gave well wishes. In order to join Ming Yu\u2019s fan forum, the true love fans passed the 100 questions and paid the membership fee. Then they started a posted.</p><br/><p>They kept posting instead of replying to only one post and they all said the same sentence.</p><br/><p>This type of behavior would usually have the IPs blocked. However, this time even a few moderators joined to constantly write:</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you are good, we are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you are good, we are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you are good, we are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>On the other side, there were too many Xi Ze fans and it was hard for them to unify. It was obvious that passersby couldn\u2019t speak on the Muse fan forum. Ming Yu\u2019s total number of fans was 20 million but Xi Ze had reached a terrible 45 million. This gap was unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Due to this, some fans on Xi Ze\u2019s side hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u3010 The photos are like this but is it really them? \u3011 After all, the male god who they liked for 10 years was suddenly with another person. As long as they weren\u2019t CP fans, most fans couldn\u2019t\u2019 help feeling a bit sour. It was an impossible first love and they knew there was no hope. But to bless their first love when he got a lover, this type of bitter feeling deep in the heart couldn\u2019t be resisted.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were loyal but they only liked him for a bit more than a year.</p><br/><p>What about Xi Ze?</p><br/><p>Many of Xi Ze\u2019s fans liked this male god from their teenage years. When they were in high school, they saved their soda money to buy magazines where he was on the cover and even some of the items he endorsed.</p><br/><p>Now almost 10 years later, these teenage girls had become mature women. It seemed very interesting when they looked back on the time. However, as they grew up, Xi Ze became a man they looked up to and respected with all their hearts.</p><br/><p>Many people thought that no one in this world would be worthy of Xi Ze or that he wouldn\u2019t like anyone.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you see that Xi Ze didn\u2019t have any bit of news regarding a big beauty like He Chaoman?</p><br/><p>The fans didn\u2019t expect for a person to really exist. He just appeared a bit late and his gender was male.</p><br/><p>With this complicated mood, Xi Ze\u2019s fans chose to act like Ming Yu\u2019s fans. They started to feel the screen with blessings, hoping Xi Ze would see it. Everyone was trying to maintain order and let everyone calm down. Don\u2019t act rashly until actual evidence came out.</p><br/><p>This time, they waited and a few more photos came out!</p><br/><p>It was still a sneak shot!</p><br/><p>It was a photo from a dark place.</p><br/><p>This was a quiet and secluded park trail. The bright moonlight slowly fell from the sky and dyed the ground autumn-white. From deep in the forest, a man walked along the man holding the hand of a young man.</p><br/><p>Tall, handsome and upright.</p><br/><p>The two men\u2019s hands were held tightly and it could clearly be seen with the five senses.</p><br/><p>Now no one could question the relationship between the two people.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s fans were silent and no one dared to make a post. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were happy, although there were some small losses. A CP fan even wrote on her Weibo: \u3010 I have always been a fan of God Xi x Ming Xiaoyu but I didn\u2019t expect this thing to be true. I am a bit sad. The Small Mushroom that I put at the top of my heart, he was taken away. Although I am a CP fan, I feel a bit lost. \u3011</p><br/><p>Of course, this loss was only temporary and everyone soon continued to be happy.</p><br/><p>But the celebration didn\u2019t last long with the po (TL: seems to be the short form for the poster) called Rising Supermodel is Gay suddenly released a long Weibo. \u3010 Do you really think there is any true love in this industry? \u3011</p><br/><p>The Weibo was over 3,000 words and detailed all of Ming Yu\u2019s experiences from his debut until now!</p><br/><p>At the age of 14, he entered Muse.</p><br/><p>At the age of 15, he was on the cover of the second-tier magazine Meditation Road and appeared in the inner cover of the first-tier Lanka.</p><br/><p>At 16 years old, he participating in the advertisement of a second-tier cosmetics brand as a supporting role.</p><br/><p>From 14 to 17, Ming Yu\u2019s life went from a high to a low. However, all the netizens were surprised to find that after 17 years old, Ming Yu flew up in an instant!</p><br/><p>Seeing these qualifications of the past was nothing. It just so happened that the po wrote some meaningful words next to the timeline.</p><br/><p>In November 2016, Xi Ze and Ming Yu interacted on Weibo for the first time. In December 2016, Xi Ze attended the Pei Feng autumn fashion show. \uff08 Note: this was the only fashion show for a second-tier brand hat Xi Ze attended in the past three years.\uff09</p><br/><p>January 2017\u2026</p><br/><p>A variety of materials linked Ming Yu and Xi Ze together almost every month.</p><br/><p>Without a careful investigation, these past things were very easy to ignore. But once they were pointed out, people became vaguely aware: \u3010 How come Ming Yu got so many jobs. Does it have anything to do with Xi Ze? \u3011 As for these qualifications, only the insiders of the industry knew. At the end of the lost post, Rising Supermodel is Gay po master wrote this:</p><br/><p>\u3010 I have exposed Ming Yu because I really look down on his behavior. I heard a friend say that a super newcomer in the industry could get a rapid development because he held onto another person\u2019s thighs and accepted the unspoken rules. I still didn\u2019t believe it until my friend showed my these photos.</p><br/><p>I used to like Ming Yu and never thought he was such a person.</p><br/><p>I am here to expose one thing. The first 10 photos in the beginning are taken in the car. My friend was just passing by and noticed with his keen eyesight. In order to take a big road, Ming Yu took the initiative to climb the gold master. Yes, my friend told me it was Ming Yu who took the initiative, not Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Why is there such deep water in our industry?</p><br/><p>Why do people mention our water depth when they talk about our fashion industry and the entertainment industry next door?</p><br/><p>It is because there are people like Ming Yu! He doesn\u2019t think about progress and just wants to rely on the unspoken rules to be a model!</p><br/><p>I am against the unspoken rules. I resist Ming Yu! \u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

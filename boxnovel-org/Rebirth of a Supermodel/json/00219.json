The fans would support Xi Ze no matter what he chose. If he chose to suddenly retire, they would wish Xi Ze the best for his future.</p><br/><p>This type of thing could be accepted in the mind, but once it became a reality, even the optimistic fans found it a bit sad and unacceptable.</p><br/><p>\u3010 I started to like Xi Ze when I was in high school and now I am already a mother. I am one year younger than Xi Ze but he is my teenage dream. Now I am seeing him live better and better. I am really happy but I think he will retire from the industry in the future. I am really sad T^T \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 @Xi Ze has never mentioned retiring but I can see that day isn\u2019t far away. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I liked @Xi Ze in the Ji and Ya high-end show but I will support him no matter when he leaves the catwalk! This performance is really amazing. The video of the high-end show hasn\u2019t come out yet but when I saw the photos, I saw that God Xi is still my god! \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>For any supermodel, two years of inaction was absolutely fatal.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze held the Ji and Ya global spokesperson contract and was also the world\u2019s fashion godfather. Otherwise, he would\u2019ve been pulled down from the throne a long time ago and probably even removed from the supermodels list.</p><br/><p>It was really difficult to balance the identity of a designer and supermodel. It was also difficult to take into account the identity of chief designer for the world\u2019s top luxury brand and first ranked male supermodel.</p><br/><p>In the first few years, Xi Ze and his team never said anything but the fans could see that their god was really tired.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t say anything when Xi Ze didn\u2019t take on any jobs for two years. They gradually turned into designer fans and some even chose a design major because they liked him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly taking so many resources after a two year empty window, any person would think in a certain direction.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why in one day, the #Xi Ze Retirement# topic reached the top three of Weibo and there were all types of discussions in Baidu.</p><br/><p>As for Xi Ze\u2019s Muse fan forum, it now had more than 43 million fans. Fortunately, the moderators placed restrictions and asked people to wait for news, otherwise the fans would\u2019ve already started to talk.</p><br/><p>Due to the relationship between Xi Ze and Ming Yu, many fans of Xi Ze also went to Ming Yu\u2019s Weibo and fan forum to ask Ming Yu if Xi Ze was retiring. This mentality was understandable to individuals so the mushroom fans didn\u2019t blame them. Instead, a post was opened where this matter could be discussed.</p><br/><p>The controversy continued until early morning of the next day, when Ming Yu posted a message on his Weibo and fan forum.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Yu: He dares to leave now? I won\u2019t allow it! Didn\u2019t you say you would wait for me @Xi Ze? \u3011 One hour after that, the man replied:</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xi Ze: I will be waiting for you @Ming Yu \u3011</p><br/><p>After a few minutes, the fans were just feeling moved when the man unexpectedly posted something else.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xi Ze: Hey, it is late. Sleep @Ming Yu. \u3011</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u2018\u2026Oh my god, would he die if he didn\u2019t show love?!! \uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b!!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s message caused the fans to recall the event two years ago.</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, two years had passed. Two years ago, many of them didn\u2019t know who Ming Yu was. Most people ridiculed Ming Yu for being too arrogant and daring to say he would go beyond Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Now many of them had become Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans and the man he threatened to surpass had become his lover.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the two originally unrelated people were currently doing @#\uff04@#\uff04@#\uff04#! In any case, it was a show of love!</p><br/><p>Time was fleeting.</p><br/><p>This evening, the two men dropped a big piece of news and ran away, making the fans unable to sleep. They ran very well. After Xi Ze said to \u2018sleep\u2019, the two of them really didn\u2019t appear. The fans started to recall the past.</p><br/><p>\u3010 When I saw someone who dared to speak about surpassing God Xi on a talk show, I thought this child was a newborn calf and not afraid of the tiger called God Xi. Two years ago, Xi Ze had just taken an advertisement for Ji and Ya. I didn\u2019t expect that after that, Xi Ze didn\u2019t set foot in the supermodel circle for two years. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 At that time, I said that Ming Xiaoyu wanting to go beyond Xi Ze was just a fool\u2019s dream. Oh, I am already a mushroom fan so don\u2019t hit me QAQ. I just ordered the latest Muse so I can lick Small Mushroom again\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 At that time, I was about to graduate and now I\u2019m married. Two years have passed so quickly. Ming Xiaoyu really became the second ranked supermodel in the world rankings and he is married to God Xi\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 LS Fight me! It is Xi Ze who is married to Small Mushroom!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Why are you fighting? God Xi and Small Mushroom are both mine!!! \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>When you met someone you could hold hands with for decades, some people would have a wonderful feeling. This could be called love at first sight. Most people thought that nothing happened but they didn\u2019t expect the love to be so vigorous and deep in the heart.</p><br/><p>It was like the first meeting between Xi Ze and Ming Yu. One man had soup spilt on him and washed his hands carefully for a full 10 minutes. During this process, the youth\u2019s intrusion was just a trivial episode. However, their life trajectories started to overlap.</p><br/><p>In the past year, Xi Ze rarely made the suggestion about Ming Yu being his own model, even though the idea was still in his heart. Now that he had his muse as a lover, he could see Ming Yu all the time and there was no need to be a special model.</p><br/><p>The initial meeting of the two people was inseparable to who they were now.</p><br/><p>If Xi Ze hadn\u2019t heard the name \u2018Ming Yu\u2019 from Master Fei\u2019s mouth, he wouldn\u2019t remember the name in his heart. If he didn\u2019t see the youth and knew who he was, he wouldn\u2019t have cared about this youth later.</p><br/><p>\u300e The person I most want to go beyond is Xi Ze. \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e I liked Xi Ze before entering this industry. He is my motivation for entering the fashion industry and made me want to be a model. Every time I feel tired, I think about when I saw Xi Ze\u2019s endorsement of the \u2018Red Poppy\u2019 perfume. He is my goal in this industry. I will continuously work hard and even if I can never go beyond him, I would like to look up at him. \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e I\u2019ll wait for you. \u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Once the fans thought about this, they discovered a big secret and couldn\u2019t help feeling,: \u3010 My god, I also liked God Xi for so many years. Why couldn\u2019t I marry God Xi? \uff08&gt;\uff3f&lt;\uff09!!! \u3011 Of course, a long time ago, Xi Ze took to Weibo to ask Xiaoyu if his words on the talk show were a lie. Did Ming Yu really like Xi Ze and enter the industry because of him?</p><br/><p>The answer was self-evident.</p><br/><p>The youth laughed as he looked down at the man. \u201cI entered the industry because of you? Your face is this -\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f- big!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man hummed casually at Ming Yu\u2019s answer and said \u201cI don\u2019t know how big my face is. But you should be the clearest about how big \u2018I\u2019 am.\u201d This was followed by the shy mushroom cooking process. The scent that could only be smelt and couldn\u2019t be eaten really made other people jealous\uff5e</p><br/><p>But the fans killed by dog food naturally didn\u2019t know these things. A group of skills masters started to write and draw stories about the story that started two years ago!</p><br/><p>At that time, there was a lovely little mushroom who wanted to become the tallest plant in the model forest. He wanted to go beyond the forest\u2019s tallest metasequoia. He was laughed at by many small stones and shells. But this small mushroom didn\u2019t give up and tried hard to move forward.</p><br/><p>Once the metasequoia see this silly and cute small mushroom, his heart was moved and the two slowly came into contact with each other. They came into contact and the metasequoia said, \u201cSmall Mushroom, your body is so soft. I like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The small mushroom said, \u201cMetasequoia, you are very tall. I also like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The metasequoia immediately nodded. \u201cIf you like me then become my wife. I can show you the more distant scenery. Come on, sit on my shoulder. Only you can sit on my shoulder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cough, for the time being, let\u2019s not mention about whether a certain man had a back door for his lover\u2019s convenience. This story was too good\uff5e</p><br/><p>Soon there was a bunch of metasequoia x small mushroom stories.</p><br/><p>It was the middle of the night so only Luo Ru saw these things when managing the forum. Luo Ru immediately blushed with shame but the small mushroom was really soft and fat. Therefore, Luo Ru kept a few pieces while deleting others.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Xi Ze was sleeping with his mushroom and didn\u2019t know how hard the fans were working.</p><br/><p>The next day, Ming Xiaoyu saw the works that filled the forums, Weibo and Baidu and kicked a man off the bed. \u201cYour pot, your shoulder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was scolded for a while but Ming Yu didn\u2019t feel less angry.</p><br/><p>Then at Xi Ze\u2019s signal, Ding Bo issued an announcement on Xi Ze\u2019s fan forum that there was no clear plan for retirement, please don\u2019t worry.</p><br/><p>At this time, after waiting a full week, the video of Ji and Ya\u2019s July high-end show was finally released!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

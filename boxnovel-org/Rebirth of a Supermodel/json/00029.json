The cold winter wind blew Xi Ze\u2019s clothes. He looked at the youth in front of him as the wind blew his hair, exposing a pair of narrow eyes.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Ming Yu had seen Xi Ze so close.</p><br/><p>At a distance that was less than half a metre, the man with a height of 193cm exerted a crushing pressure on Ming Yu, forcing Ming Yu to look up slightly.</p><br/><p>This aura, it spread out in such an unbridled manner. Whenever this man appeared somewhere, he was destined to master the rhythm of the audience. They couldn\u2019t help paying attention to him and recognize his commands.</p><br/><p>Just like the first time Ming Yu met Xi Ze, one side was awkward and the other side was calm. At that time, even Ming Yu was suppressed by this man, narrowly resisting being dominated by the other.</p><br/><p>But this time, Xi Ze was doomed to be disappointed.</p><br/><p>In the dimly lit parking lot, the youth showed just a moment of surprise before straightening his back. Ming Yu nodded with an indifferent expression and said with a smile, \u201cHello Mr. Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s voice seemed to be a mixture of maturity and immaturity. However, this strange feature suited Xi Ze\u2019s taste, causing his lips to quietly curve up.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s tone was casual, as if he didn\u2019t care about who was in front of him, but he was still polite.</p><br/><p>So what if you are taller than me now?</p><br/><p>\u2026Can you suppress me?</p><br/><p>In the dim lightning, sly cunning flashed through the youth\u2019s eyes. However, he was also secretly determined to work hard!</p><br/><p>Ding Bo didn\u2019t seem to be aware of the confrontation between the two swords as he laughed. \u201cI was downstairs when I realized I forgot my keys. Xi Ze went up to grab them, so I decided to wait for him in the parking lot.\u201d After a pause, he added, \u201cBy the way, do you need me to give you a lift if you are leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui shook his head. \u201cWe are going to Muse\u2019s artist apartments. It shouldn\u2019t be on your way. I have a car, so just go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui finished and turned to Xi Ze. After discovering Xi Ze staring at his young model, Zhao Rui was intuitively aware of something. He unconsciously went to Ming Yu and smiled at Xi Ze. \u201cMr. Xi, thank you for your support of Ming Yuon Weibo this afternoon. We will go ahead, so please be careful on the road.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s words ended and he intended to leave with Ming Yu. He didn\u2019t know why, but his intuition was telling him that there might be problems if they stayed, so it was better to leave quickly.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu nodded at Xi Ze and was about to leave first with Zhao Rui, when Xi Ze suddenly smiled and opened his mouth. \u201cI am very busy and can\u2019t wait. We will go first.\u201d After looking at the surprised eyes of Ming Yu and the other three people, Xi Ze looked at his agent and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The issue of \u2018who will go first and who will go afterwards\u2019 seemed simple, but as Ming Yu looked at the luxurious European car driving out of the parking lot, he had no idea how to describe his mood.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui waited until they got on the car and asked curiously, \u201cWhat did Xi Ze mean by his last words? Why can\u2019t he wait and why did he need to go first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru interrupted from the side. \u201cI also don\u2019t understand. Did Mr. Xi have an urgent matter that required him to leave so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth sitting in the back seat of the car just smiled lightly as his heart found the answer.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Xi Ze said that \u2018I will wait for you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Now he \u2018couldn\u2019t wait?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, in fact, you don\u2019t have to wait. I will catch up to you soon.</p><br/><p>Driving out of the parking lot, the warm but not dazzling winter light shone on the faces of the youth. He listened as Zhao Rui cried out, \u201cXi Ze\u2019s pressure is as strong as always! When I first entered the company, I heard that he had a very strong personality that people can\u2019t help trusting and obeying. I didn\u2019t believe it at first, but after I saw him personally, I truly believed it. This type of person exists!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words made Ming Yu\u2019s eyes slightly narrow. He looked in the mirror at the driving Zhao Rui and listened as the latter continued. \u201cYou both entered the company too late. Especially Little Luo, you have only entered the company for a year and just left the training course. Xi Ze did a lot of generation actions that year, causing the Muse executives to shuffle. I heard from A\u2019Wei that Xi Ze currently has a lot of top employees as his confidants, including that Shen Xiang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The car smoothly drove through Beijing as Zhao Rui\u2019s words disappeared into the crowded traffic.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a European car was driving in the opposite directly. The calm and tranquil atmosphere made people feel happy. Even Ding Bo was affected, humming slightly as he drove. He didn\u2019t bother concealing his happiness.</p><br/><p>At a traffic light, while torturing the ears with humming, Ding Bo casually asked, \u201cXi Ze, the words you spoke were unusual. Do you really think that Ming Yu is your muse?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man leaned his head against the driver\u2019s seat in front of him. He raised his hand, gently kneading his temple before whispering, \u201cDo you think he isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is your inspiration, so how should I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you curious about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For a short while, Ding Bo thought about killing the man. He was humming a song when Xi Ze suddenly sighed softly. \u201cHe should be the person that I am looking for.\u201d Xi Ze paused and added. \u201cThe probability is 99%.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c99%\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s calm eyes flashed with a touch of darkness as he said, \u201cYes, 99%.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was at a loss. \u201cIt is 99%? Didn\u2019t we work so hard doing overtime because you took the time to see his fashion show, but you still aren\u2019t sure? How can you be sure? Shen Xiang, that kid has already changed Ming Yu to the highest level of attention, don\u2019t hold him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking carefully for a moment, Xi Ze asked, \u201cDo you see have the invitation letter from Old Fei?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo exclaimed at the mention of this, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? 30 invitations! It is that old man\u2019s family, so he wanted you to \u2018help!\u2019 Isn\u2019t that right? Why does the person sending the invitation have such a bad temper? He is just a little better than you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t care about his agent\u2019s slander. He just smiled and nodded. \u201cAh, then I will go see the fashion show\u2026 the fashion show where Ming Yu is the chief model.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you have the final say.\u201d Ding Bo thought for a moment and couldn\u2019t help asking. \u201cBy the way, Xi Ze, you aren\u2019t acting like this because Ming Yu looks so good and you fancy him, right? But your attention is really too much at this time. He is young and his experience isn\u2019t enough. Is he really your muse? What do you like about him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you think he is cut\u2026\u201d Ding Bo\u2019s voice stopped abruptly as he looked horrified. \u201cCute? Can you repeat that? Is he cute??? No, I really can\u2019t understand your concept of cuteness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was very calm as he looked at his panicked agent. Then his lips curved as he proclaimed, \u201cHis cuteness, you can\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t cute! What was so hard to understand?</p><br/><p>Stop making a face like you are doubting my taste!</p><br/><p>I am the one doubting your taste!!!</p><br/><p>Soon, the car returned to the quiet atmosphere. Ding Bo was ignoring the man and once again humming when the low and magnetic voice came from the back seat again. \u201cThe back seat is a little dirty. Remember to ensure that people carefully clean it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t people just clean it the day before yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>The indifferent Xi Ze, \u201cIt is dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Can you change this evil cleanliness!!!</p><br/><p>Ding Bo hummed energetically while feeling motivated by his anger. However, he could only hum a few notes when the man flatly spat out, \u201cDisgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201cDrive quietly\u2026\u201d He hesitated for a long moment, before deciding to tell the truth as an old friend. \u201cYour singing is really difficult to listen to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c@#\uff04@#@\uff05@#\uff05@#!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this a euphemism?</p><br/><p>What euphemism?</p><br/><p>If it was a euphemism. then what did you say in the beginning?!!!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t know that at this moment, his two fashion shows were attracting one man\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>After all, Fei Sixin\u2019s fashion show needed to be carefully thought about for a few days until it was finalized next week. In this fortnight, Ming Yu wasn\u2019t idle. He received a surge in popularity after filming the talk show, so the Huaxia second-tire Meditation Road took the initiative and once again invited Ming Yu to shoot a cover for them.</p><br/><p>Meditation Road was the second-tier magazine that the original owner appeared on. In recent years, its development was quite good and it had become a leader of the second-tier magazines. Receiving this invitation was proof of Ming Yu\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>The original owner had obtained it because the company actively allocated resources to him. But this time, Ming Yu used his own strength to make Meditation Road throw him an olive branch.</p><br/><p>Thus, after the completion of this \u2018thinking\u2019 period where he shot a cover photo, the day of the fashion show would soon arrive.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

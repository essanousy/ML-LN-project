She didn\u2019t get the Golden Bear Award but her performance in the movie was obvious. She was also recently nominated as Best Actress at the Oscars.</p><br/><p>In the past, Xiao Biqing would take a break and relax after a big movie. But perhaps due to the labour model, Xiao Biqing learned about the diligence of her small mushroom and happened to meet a good script. Therefore, she accepted the movie Midnight Singing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing was playing the heroine of the movie and after reading the script, the first actor she thought of was Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>This movie didn\u2019t have a clear love line. It mainly told the story of a brother and sister in a chaotic world.</p><br/><p>The younger brother was weak since childhood and spent 300 days a year in bed. He couldn\u2019t walk independently or live on his own. After an accident befell his family, the burden of the entire family fell on his 12 year old sister.</p><br/><p>The storyline of this movie was very simple. It was about what the brother and sister were willing to sacrifice for each other. Xiao Biqing thought about Ming Yu playing the role of her younger brother because Ming Yu\u2019s interpretation of Bai Xiu at the end of An Li made her feel moved.</p><br/><p>Xu Yizong also said that Ming Yu\u2019s best acting was this sentence at the end.</p><br/><p>The innocent teenager in white, his eyes reflected a pure world. This image was a perfect fit for a boy who was well protected by his sister. He had no idea how dark the world was or how much his sister had suffered. His kindness was protected but also shone a light on the whole movie.</p><br/><p>Life might be very tragic but not everyone\u2019s heart was contaminated with blood and mud.</p><br/><p>Since Ming Yu didn\u2019t plan to cross industries, he refused when Xiao Biqing first discussed this matter with him on the phone. However, Xiao Biqing believed that Ming Yu could play this role very well and took her agent and the assistant director to Muse to personally discuss this matter with Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>This screenplay was really very good. After the two sides talked for an afternoon, Ming Xiaoyu was happy to sign his name on the contract and also squeezed out time in his schedule for the filming.</p><br/><p>The shoot for this role could be squeezed together so he didn\u2019t need to have too many simultaneous jobs.</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu forwarded Xiao Biqing\u2019s Weibo and the official Weibo of the movie, the whole fan group exploded!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Movie? Mushroom is going to act in a movie again? Ahhhhh it is amazing! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Resources! All resources! It is another great resource to edit a video! @Big skilled masters, come see the resources \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 It is actually with Goddess Xiao? @Xiao Xiao Yu Yu, other people are envious. I also want to act with Ming Xiaoyu\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Many fans were happy that Ming Xiaoyu was acting in a movie. Although Ming Yu appeared in a movie a few months ago, he said in a variety show that he didn\u2019t want to switch to being an actor. He just wanted to be a model. But for the vast majority of fans, there were only so many tickets to a fashion show and most weren\u2019t for sale, so they couldn\u2019t go to the scene to see their mushroom.</p><br/><p>At the same time, if Ming Xiaoyu participated in brand promotional activities, the event venue was limited and it wasn\u2019t possible for many mushroom fans to see him.</p><br/><p>However, a movie was different.</p><br/><p>They could see Ming Yu in every movie theater in the world. They could go to the theatre again and again to see the wonderful performance of their mushroom on the big screen again and again. They could see a variety of mushrooms and see mushroom\u2019s rich expressions.</p><br/><p>Were fans of the fashion industry bitter? They were really pained!</p><br/><p>The fashion show couldn\u2019t be seen in person and could only be seen on the Internet. Even if he was the finale model, there were many shots of the audience. It wasn\u2019t enough!</p><br/><p>In addition, Ming Yu was working with Xiao Biqing this time. After becoming famous, Goddess Xiao never accepted any bad scripts. At the same time, the box office for all of Xiao Biqing\u2019s movies were very good. Presumably this would be an excellent result for Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Comrades, May had come!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t the world supermodel rankings for June almost here?</p><br/><p>The mushroom fans were excited and ready to go, waiting for the release of the world supermodel rankings.</p><br/><p>But at this time, the first thing they were waiting for wasn\u2019t the world supermodel rankings. It was the list of supermodels invited to Ji and Ya\u2019s July high-end show.</p><br/><p>The list was published in the order that the models would appear. The first one to appear was the opening model: Kelson Eddie.</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned when they saw this name and subconsciously thought:</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s second ranked supermodel Kelson Eddie was unexpectedly the opening model. Then who was qualified to be the finale model?</p><br/><p>A familiar name instantly surfaced in many people\u2019s head. However, they continued to look down the list. The second person was the 16th ranked Han Zhengqiao, the third to appear was the 21st ranked Aris Codona\u2026</p><br/><p>The third last was the world\u2019s 5th ranked male model, Harriman Owen, the second last was the world\u2019s 4th ranked Ming Yu\u2026</p><br/><p>Eh?!!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was out?</p><br/><p>Then the last one was\u2014</p><br/><p>\u300e Xi Ze \u300f.</p><br/><p>\u2026Xi Ze?!!</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, there was the name Xi Ze?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze would appear in a show again?</p><br/><p>Hey, how old was he to appear in a show\u2026</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t right. Xi Ze was only 26 years old this year. It was two years younger than Harriman Owen and two years younger than Kelson Eddie\u2026 but why did they feel so weird?</p><br/><p>And appearing after his wife, was this really not intentional?</p><br/><p>\u3010 I just looked at the list four times and I read it four times\u2026 No, I went to see it the fifth time. I came back and QAQ. God Xi is really appearing in the Ji and Ya high-end show ahhhh! He will actually appear in a show! I almost thought I was his design fan but I originally started out as a model fan! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 LS you aren\u2019t alone! I have long forgotten that God Xi is a supermodel and have already turned into a designer fan! He can still walk in a show, he can still walk in a show! It\u2019s not normal! Clearly it is very important for a supermodel to appear on the catwalk. But when this happens to be God Xi, why do I feel so strange? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 You aren\u2019t the only one! I\u2019ve also discovered that God Xi actually let Ming Xiaoyu go second last while he himself is the finale model! Let\u2019s think about it. God Xi deliberately appeared after his wife in order to keep his image as the gong! \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>After the Ji and Ya invitation list came out, all the fashion lovers around the world were shocked.</p><br/><p>Apart from Rosalind\u2019s global spokesperson Luo Cheng who wasn\u2019t invited, the top 20 supermodels in the world were unexpectedly all invited! In addition, there were another 13 who were all supermodels in the top 50. This lineup was so powerful!</p><br/><p>Ji and Ya dared to publish the list on their official website, showing that they already made an appointment with all these supermodels and confirmed that everyone would attend.</p><br/><p>Look around the world. What high-end brand would dare have Harriman Owen and Ming Yu as the non-opening or non-closing models? There was no one other than Ji and Ya!</p><br/><p>They could act like this because the opening model was the world\u2019s second ranked supermodel and the finale was the world\u2019s first ranked supermodel!</p><br/><p>Yi and Ja hadn\u2019t had a high-end menswear show for two years and now it shocked the world!</p><br/><p>Once the invitation list was released, many supermodels made comments on their Weibo and Twitter, indicating that they were very happy to receive Ji and Ya\u2019s invitation letter and that they would gather in the capital of Huaxia to take part in the 2018 Huaxia fashion week.</p><br/><p>As for Luo Cheng who wasn\u2019t invited, he also whined on his own Weibo to Ming Xiaoyu. He didn\u2019t dare say anything to Xi Ze, but he was angry about not being invited.</p><br/><p>The relationship between Rosalind and Ji and Ya wasn\u2019t very good. Therefore, this time Luo Cheng not receiving an invitation didn\u2019t have anything to do with Xi Ze. It was the result of an unanimous vote with the high level people in Ji and Ya.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ming Xiaoyu hadn\u2019t yet replied to Luo Cheng. On the other hand, his boyfriend made a fuss.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xi Ze: Who are you angry with? // @Luo Cheng: I want an invitation letter. I want to sit down and watch the show. If you don\u2019t give me an invitation letter, I will be very angry! @Ming Yu \u3011</p><br/><p>The onlooker fans, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng said such words yet Xi Ze felt the need to protect his Ming Xiaoyu. Once he saw Xi Ze\u2019s Weibo, Luo Cheng issued a \u2018poor and miserable\u2019 expression. He didn\u2019t dare confront Xi Ze directly, stimulating Ming Yu\u2019s sense of justice.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Yu: I\u2019m angry with you! Why are you acting behind me. Too willful! // @Xi Ze: Who are you angry with?/ /@Luo Cheng: I want an invitation\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>It was rare to see such a proud small mushroom. The watching crowd immediately moved their benches and ate hand melon seeds as they waited for the reply. Xi Ze\u2019s reaction didn\u2019t disappoint them.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xi Ze: I wasn\u2019t angry, I was wrong. I will go back to kneeling on the magazines @Ming Yu \u3011</p><br/><p>Putting on a show every day, these two people were too idle!</p><br/><p>The mushroom fans were really blinded and finally turned around and said, \u201cI can\u2019t see your love show, I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m going to look at the skilled masters next door.\u201d They had just turned around when they saw:</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: Do you want sweet and sour pork ribs, sweet and sour pork tenderloins, sweet and sour fish and sweet and sour steak this evening? @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: Oh, who wants to eat your vinegar? Get lost! @Zyu \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026Oh my god, the whole world was showing love. This group of people were too much, making the single dogs disapprove!</p><br/><p>At the end of May 2018, Ming Yu\u2019s fan forum updated with his latest development, stating that Ming Xiaoyu had entered the Midnight Singing crew and it was ready to film.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the May that had become lively due to the Ji and Ya list was filled with all types of gay shows of love, causing the single dogs to die.</p><br/><p>Soon, everyone ushered in a more heated June.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It might focus on female fashion but that didn\u2019t mean it would only invite female models and celebrities. For example, this April Suyi invited Luo Cheng to be the cover person and shot a large block.</p><br/><p>Working with magazines was something Ming Xiaoyu was quite good at.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the slightest bit nervous as he accepted the interview from Suyi\u2019s editor. Later, he negotiated with the stylist and they finally reached a consensus on a wild style. The beast wild style would be the cover style of Suyi next month.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had never tried the beast wild style since his debut. If this style wasn\u2019t good that it would make people feel dirty and even awkward. But once it was performed well, it would make people feel wild and comfortable, an uninhibited feeling.</p><br/><p>After designing the style, it was close to evening. The two parties agreed to take all the photos the day after tomorrow and to end today\u2019s schedule. As they were leaving Suyi, the editors and reporters drank the tea that Zhao Rui specifically bough and greeted Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>Earlier, Ming Xiaoyu gave a lot of signatures when he came to Suyi. Now that he was leaving, the editors couldn\u2019t help but ask if he could give them a special signature for them and Ming Xiaoyu agreed one by one.</p><br/><p>After opening the door of Suyi magazine, Ming Yu\u2019s gaze was overwhelmed by the two pink carved characters \u2018Suyi\u2019 on the door.</p><br/><p>He walked away and sighed, \u201cThe atmosphere of Suyi really isn\u2019t as good as Muse.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, Ming Yu and Zhao Rui had already walked towards the elevator and gone down. Zhao Rui asked in a strange manner, \u201cXiaoyu, do you think the atmosphere of Suyi isn\u2019t as good as Muse?\u201d After carefully thinking for a while, Zhao Rui said, \u201cYou have a point. I feel that Suyi is more lifeless, as if everything has a set of procedures. Muse is more active and there is more room for innovation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s analysis was quite good. Muse and Suyi might be the top fashion magazines in Huaxia, but the former had only been established for decades while the latter had been established for almost a hundred years.</p><br/><p>Judging by the historical background of the two, Suyi was quite good. However, it often lost instead of winning. In today\u2019s fast changing Internet era, the deeper the foundation, the harder it was to change yourself. This was why after the introduction of Suyi into the 21st century, its sales were always a bit worse than Muse.</p><br/><p>But these things weren\u2019t related to Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>The elevator <i>dinged </i>as it opened on both sides and dazzling sunlight illuminated the crack in the door.</p><br/><p>When the elevator opened, Ming Yu was still turning to talk to Zhao Rui and took a random step. He hadn\u2019t stepped out of the elevator when he heard a surprised shout, \u201cMing Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was startled and turned to look at the person outside the elevator. He took a look before suddenly stopping.</p><br/><p>After a moment, the young man\u2019s delicate face showed a smile. Ming Xiaoyu gently nodded and said, \u201cLong time no see, Mr. Luo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng immediately waved. \u201cIt is fine to call me Luo Cheng. What is Mr. Luo? I\u2019m not that old!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Luo Cheng reached out and grabbed Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s hand. As the latter looked on in surprise, Luo Cheng glanced at the equally astonished Zhao Rui and said, \u201cYou are Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s agent, Zhao Rui right? I am looking for Ming Xiaoyu for something. I am sorry to trouble you but can you have a cup of coffee and wait? I will walk around with Ming Xiaoyu!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Zhao Rui immediately looked at Ming Yu. He originally wanted to say something but at Ming Yu\u2019s look, he helplessly nodded and agreed to Luo Cheng\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>After all, Ming Yu and Luo Cheng were celebrities. It would be too bad if they walked around naturally. Therefore, they headed directly to the middle of the 14th floor.</p><br/><p>This floor was a complete scenic spot. Ming Yu was slightly surprised when he first entered. But after hearing Luo Cheng\u2019s explanation, he realized that the designer of this building wasted a whole floor for a rest floor used by company personnel throughout the building.</p><br/><p>But it time to work so not many people were here. Thus, only Ming Xiaoyu and Luo Cheng walked slowly around the whole floor.</p><br/><p>Almost all of the 14th floor was surrounded by greenery. The coconut trees and palm trees transplanted from the tropics added lushness to this green ocean. The green colour alone would make people feel refreshed, not to mentioned all the glass windows giving people a 360 degree view of the scenery around them.</p><br/><p>Looking at it, Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t help sighed. \u201cIt is really a good place to rest. By the way Luo Cheng, you seem to be familiar with this place. Do you come here often?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he heard this, the proud Luo Cheng covered his mouth before laughing, \u201cYes yes, I come here often to take photos and do interviews. The headquarters of Muse and Suyi are here so of course I come often, haha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t find anything wrong but he couldn\u2019t help thinking about it.</p><br/><p>He looked at Luo Cheng for a long time, who could only sweat and laugh hollowly. Ming Xiaoyu sighed softly at the sight He didn\u2019t want to inquire about the private matter of others. Thus, he changed the subject. \u201cYou brought me here today to show me this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think that Ming Xiaoyu was stupid. He thought that as long as it was this husky\u2026cough, as long as it was Luo Cheng, he would be foolish enough to actually do so.</p><br/><p>It was as if Luo Cheng woke up from a dream. \u201cYes! I would\u2019ve forgotten it if you hadn\u2019t mentioned it. I came looking for you for something. You should know Rosalind right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu frowned slightly. \u201cThe top fashion brand in the United States, Rosalind?\u201d He paused before adding with a smile. \u201cI think everyone in the industry should know Rosalind. Even outsiders have heard its name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng smiled widely, revealing his white teeth. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also know that you are the global spokesperson for Rosalind in the upcoming year, endorsing its male clothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng was stunned hearing this and he asked with wide eyes, \u201cEh? How can you know this? I only settled this matter in the middle of last month. I was waiting until next week to announce it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Luo Cheng\u2019s shocked expression, Ming Xiaoyu laughed and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>He had no desire to inquire about Luo Cheng. Xi Ze just accidentally mentioned Luo Cheng in a conversation. At that time, XI Ze said that Luo Cheng was in the United States and signing a global contract with Rosalind.</p><br/><p>Then the next second, Luo Cheng opened his hands and said, \u201cMr. Xi must\u2019ve told you? Sure enough, both of you are lovers so it is normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, this type of intelligence wasn\u2019t suitable for Luo Cheng\u2026</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng added. \u201cSpeaking of which. Ming Yu, you must be below when you are with Mr. Xi?\u201d This time, he didn\u2019t wait for Ming Xiaoyu to answer. Luo Cheng\u2019s shoulders shrank back with understanding. \u201cNot that it is bad. It isn\u2019t bad not to be above! This is too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s mouth slightly shook before he reluctantly said, \u201cIn fact, I am on top.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as these words were spoken, Luo Cheng looked at Ming Xiaoyu with an expression that said, \u2018What husky would believe that?\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the original topic.\u201d \uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b</p><br/><p>After that, Ming Yu realized that Luo Cheng met him in order to invite him to the charity party held by Rosalind.</p><br/><p>This year\u2019s RAmer Charity Gala would be hosted by Rosalind. Since Luo Cheng was their global spokesperson, it was natural to invite famous Huaxia models to participate.</p><br/><p>Rosalind called Luo Cheng\u2019s agent a few days ago, hoping to invite the newest supermodel in Huaxia, Ming Yu. After all, they were both models of Muse and must have some connection. Luo Cheng happily accepted this task.</p><br/><p>After learning the whole story, Ming Yu only thought about it for a moment before accepted Luo Cheng\u2019s invitation with a smile.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng was pleased, stating that his assistant would send Rosalind\u2019s invitation letter to Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s lounge the next day.</p><br/><p>The two people talked for a while. Then before leaving, Luo Cheng said with a sigh of relief. \u201cIn fact, Ming Yu, it is good that you are together with Xi Ze. He is a very stingy person but he looks after his people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Luo Cheng sighed, \u201cMr. Xi, in that regard, might not be the same as his appearance. He is quite gentle. Ming Yu, you are so blessed! Once he finished, he whispered in a voice so low that only he could hear. \u201cIn any case, he must be gentler than that guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026Hehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before formally parting, Ming Yu smiled and said, \u201cLuo Cheng, thank you for your invitation today. By the way, you seem to be quite familiar with this building and even know there is a rest area. Hey, what is that thing on your neck?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Ming Xiaoyu looked at Luo Cheng\u2019s neck with an expression of surprise.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng was shocked and quickly covered his neck. \u201cWhat?\u201d What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing him, Ming Xiaoyu said thoughtfully, \u201cNothing. I just suddenly realized that Luo Cheng\u2019s girlfriend is really fierce.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Luo Cheng went to Muse magazine and in a certain editorial office, some turmoil occurred that Ming XIaoyu was naturally unaware of. He just smiled and headed home like nothing happened.</p><br/><p>When it came to matters of sowing discord, he was really an expert at hiding himself.</p><br/><p>Once he arrived at his apartment, Ming Xiaoyu told Zhao Rui to pay attention to the invitation that Luo Cheng would send tomorrow. Zhao Rui told Ming Xiaoyu to have a good rest tomorrow. After all, he would be going to Suyi the day after tomorrow.</p><br/><p>After the two said goodbye, Ming Yu used his card to go upstairs and soon arrived at his door.</p><br/><p>As usual, he opened the door with the key. After a clear unlocking sound was heard, Ming Yu stepped into the room and intended to close the door. However, this time he couldn\u2019t do anything as his mouth and nose was suddenly covered by a person\u2019s hand!</p><br/><p>The horrified Ming Xiaoyu was planning to resist when his hands were unexpectedly grabbed.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s mouth and nose were tightly held so he could only let out a squeaking whisper. His hands were tightly held by the person as he was dragged back to the elevator.</p><br/><p>However, after the two people went out the door, Ming Xiaoyu gave up direct resistance and calmly allowed the other person to move him.</p><br/><p>Once the man got on the elevator, he didn\u2019t press the button to go down. Rather, he pressed the button for the top floor. As the appearance of \u2018you are holding my mouth and my hands, I\u2019m not resisting\u2019, the elevator gradually went up.</p><br/><p>The man seemed to realize that the youth in his arms was too cooperative. The tall man slightly bowed and whispered in the youth\u2019s ear, \u201cShall we negotiate over who is the bully and who is the good woman? This seems to fit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the voice behind him, Ming Xiaoyu suddenly sneered, raised his foot and stepped on the foot of the bully behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The bully in the back hadn\u2019t expected the youth to do this and grunted. The elevator door opened and he continued holding onto Ming Xiaoyu to his own door. The door turned out to have a fingerprint password which was extremely fast. It opened automatically in half a second.</p><br/><p>This time, the bully pushed the youth inside very rudely. Ming Xiaoyu hadn\u2019t expected to be pushed into the house.</p><br/><p>This type of play carried silently out in the darkness made him very curious as a faint anticipation ignited in his heart. Ming Yu didn\u2019t know the anticipation in his eyes. He coughed and leaned against the wall, saying, \u201cI am the bully, you are the good woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Bang. </i>The sound caused Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s next words to be completely submerged in his throat.</p><br/><p>In the dark room, the man\u2019s deep eyes were illuminated by the moonlight outside the window as he stared at the youth in front of him. One hand was pressed against the wall while the youth was trapped in his arms. Strong male hormones suddenly spread out, making the youth unable to resist his rapidly increased heartbeat. He even felt a trace of heat.</p><br/><p>After slowly adapting to the dim light in the house, Ming Yu saw the man\u2019s thin lips curved as he raised a hand and pinched Ming Yu\u2019s chin. Xi Ze smiled and said, \u201cMy good woman, how do you want me to bully you today?\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>Hey guys, all good now! The antibiotics that the doctors prescribed me didn\u2019t work on what I had. However, the hospital antibiotics were extremely effective and I was feeling like a new person after just one day.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Thank you for last night\u2019s hospitality. Happy New Year. \u3011</p><br/><p>The lower right corner had the fierce \u2018Xi Ze\u2019 written on it. Ming Yu was dumbfounded but didn\u2019t refuse the other person\u2019s kindness, directly opening the door to his home.</p><br/><p>He wiped the sweat from his forehead with a towel and casually muttered, \u201cXi Ze\u2019s signature is good, but it is still lacking a bit of momentum. Hrmm\u2026 he should practice more.\u201d</p><br/><p>After breakfast, Ming Yu didn\u2019t throw away the small piece of paper from Xi Ze. He chose to carefully preserve it.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t misunderstand. Ming Yu didn\u2019t have the hobby of \u2018sneakily hiding a collection of notes.\u2019 He had a prideful appearance but he was also very honest. Ming Xiaoyu checked his Muse website forum these days, and also took a look at Xi Ze\u2019s forum. There, he discovered a topic that Xi Ze\u2019s fans were roaring about.</p><br/><p>\u3010 300 for God Xi\u2019s signature? 3,000! 30,000!!! However, there is almost no one who will part with God Xi\u2019s signature\uff3f\uff08\uff1a3\u2220\uff09\uff3f\u3011 Ming Yu saw that XI Ze\u2019s signature was unexpectedly so expensive that of course he treasured it. Setting aside his home, in addition to a few sponsored coats, perfumes and watches, Ming Yu\u2019s most valuable possession was probably his phone?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I am desperate one day, I can consider selling it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was so smart \u256e\uff08\u256f\u25bd\u2570\uff09\u256d. Anyway, after the spring festival, Ming Yu continued devoting himself to his work. It was tense, but a lot easier than before. He was much busier in his past life. In fact, Ming Yu didn\u2019t want to leave but the others wanted to!</p><br/><p>It was probably because Ming Yu\u2019s popularity was really big these days. Zhao Rui gave him notice about appearing as a special guest in a popular domestic reality show.</p><br/><p>However, before the arrival of this job, the entire fashion industry was focused on the high-end fashion shows of the major brands.</p><br/><p>In January, the fashion shows in Britain, France and Denmark ended. The top three Huaxia luxury brands waited until after the Chinese New Year to released their 2017 spring/summer collection.</p><br/><p>Among them, Ji and Ya was the first.</p><br/><p>Once Zhao Rui learned that Ming Yu actually had two invitations to Ji and Ya, his eyes became bigger and he couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI heard that there are a total of 800 invitation letters. But Xiaoyu, you actually have two? Is this right? I heard Shen Xiang say that Ji and Ya\u2019s invitations are really hard to obtain. Even the editor in chief of a second-tier magazine can only get one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing how valuable these two invitations were, Ming Yu pondered for a moment before asking, \u201cBrother Zhao, I know this invitation is very valuable, but I don\u2019t have anybody I want to invite. If you want, do you want to go with me to watch this fashion show?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was flattered. \u201cThis\u2026this\u2026 Xiaoyu, you want to invite me to go with you?\u201d ZHao Rui hesitated for a long time before shaking his head. \u201cI am your agent, but I can only be considered to be half in the fashion industry. I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with clothing and can\u2019t tell the difference between something that looks good and something that doesn\u2019t. You shouldn\u2019t waste this invitation on me. To be honest, Xiaoyu, you should use this invitation to invite a more important friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was stunned by the words. \u201cBrother Zhao, you mean\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui thought carefully before asking, \u201cWhat do you think about Miss Fei?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu immediately called Fei Sixin and asked her if she wanted to go to Ji and Ya\u2019s fashion show.</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin picked up the phone and wanted to tease Ming Xiaoyu, but once she heard his purpose, the sudden increase in decibels scared Ming Yu so much that his phone almost fell to the ground!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhhhh, Ming Xiaoyu, you actually have two invitation letters to Ji and Ya? Is this true? Are you sure you want to invite me? Ming Xiaoyu, you are really wonderful! Sister Xin really loves you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, Ming Yu found his companion for the night.</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin might be a prominent new designer recently, but it was impossible for her to get a Ji and Ya invitation with her own personal identity. Her father, Master Fei also received an invitation from Xi Ze, but it was only one. His name was also written on it, so it was impossible for his daughter to take his place.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu hung up the phone and looked at Zhao Rui with a meaningful expression. The latter felt the hairs on his body rising and couldn\u2019t help whispering, \u201cXiaoyu, what is with your expression? It is creepy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The stare lasted for so long that Zhao Rui raised his hands to beg for mercy. Ming Yu suddenly chuckled and spoke while drinking his medicinal drink. \u201cBrother Zhao, you have really grown a lot. Well\u2026 it is really great compared to when I first saw you approximately half a year ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was happy before he realized something, \u201cWait a minute, Ming Yu! What about when you saw me half a year ago? What happened to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was embarrassed. \u201cThe you before\u2026 yes, really great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying such words when your expression is showing that you don\u2019t believe it!</p><br/><p>It was February. The weather was still slightly cold but spring had already hit the branches. Green buds were quietly growing and the warm sunlight seemed to herald winter\u2019s passing and spring\u2019s arrival.</p><br/><p>Once it was time for Ji and Ya\u2019s spring/summer show, Ming Yu went to Fei Sixin\u2019s studio to borrow an outfit (Ming Xiaoyu really was poor) and then Zhao Rui drove them to the venue.</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin\u2019s left hand gently held Ming Yu\u2019s bent right arm on the red carpet. They laughed while chatting, giving off a very harmonious atmosphere. Reporters also them to take photos and sign the commemorative wall and they did as requested.</p><br/><p>Once the two people entered the building, Fei Sixin whispered in Ming Yu\u2019s ears. \u201cYour signature is really good. Out of all the ones I have seen, probably only Xi Ze and Du Ruo can compare with you.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu shook his head. \u201cSister Xin, you are overrating me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin casually refuted him. \u201cMy words are true. I heard from my father that Du Ruo is in the country and will be attending this fashion show. I have a good relationship with her. Later, I will ask her to sign her name to show you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people hadn\u2019t formally entered the venue when they suddenly heard someone shouting from behind them \u201cDu Ruo!\u201d They reflexively turned their heads to see a bright spotlight. A voluptuous woman was walking down the red carpet, calmly smiling at the reporters.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo had sexy lips and was named first in the survey from the Anna magazine about \u2018Lips that men most want to kiss.\u2019</p><br/><p>When her bright red lips showed a charming smile, don\u2019t mention the reporters, even Ming Yu was slightly startled. He watched as the other person step forward and stopped in front of himself and Fei Sixin.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo\u2019s eyes flashed across Ming Yu, before pausing for a moment with a trace of being stunned. Then she turned towards Fei Sixin and gently laughed. \u201cA\u2019Xin, it has been a long time. Since when have you obtained such a handsome young meat? Looking at his temperament, is he a model?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin raised an eyebrow and said with dissatisfaction. \u201cHave you been travelling for so long that you don\u2019t even know Ming Yu? Last time I invited you to come to my fashion show, but you were in Australia shooting an ad. Now you returned and dared to ask me this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them walked towards the stage as they talked.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo was obviously surprised when she heard \u2018Ming Yu.\u2019 She looked over at Ming Yu and said, \u201cOh, this handsome person is Ming Yu! Of course, I know you. I heard that Xi Ze chose to explore your job site for three consecutive days. You are from Muse right? Little handsome guy~\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t get to speak as Fei Sixin expressed her surprise, \u201c\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09. What? Ming Xiaoyu, Xi Ze explored your job site for three consecutive days? Wait a minute\u2026 is Xi Ze the one who gave you two invitations?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026Sister Xin. I thought you already knew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say it so how could I know? God Xi is my idol ahhhh!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if you didn\u2019t say it, he would know\u2026</p><br/><p>Once the three people arrived, Du Ruo wasn\u2019t sitting with Ming Yu so they temporarily separated. Before leaving, Fei Sixin really had Du Ruo sign her name for Ming Yu. \u201cDu Ruo looks like she is just a pretty vase, but she started practicing calligraphy at the age of 4. Her writing is very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at the elegant name and nodded while thinking, \u2018Xi Ze\u2019s writing looks a little better? Well, it still isn\u2019t as good as mine.\u2019</p><br/><p>In this regard, \u2018vase\u2019 Du Ruo was distressed. \u201cFei Sixin, why do I feel like knowing you is detrimental?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu watched Du Ruo leave and smiled.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo belonged to one of Huaxia\u2019s three major modelling agencies, Lanka. With her height and figure, she could be called Huaxia\u2019s sexiest female supermodel. She was second only to He Chaoman and was ranked third on the women\u2019s world supermodels list.</p><br/><p>This was the first time that Ming Yu had seen a top supermodel after entering this world (not Xi Ze).</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had to admit that the supermodels of this world were more dazzling, He could feel a faint oppression even when Du Ruo was far away on the red carpet.</p><br/><p>Of course, this momentum was worst than Xi Ze and there was also a gap with Ming Yu himself.</p><br/><p>But no one could deny that Du Ruo was an excellent supermodel.</p><br/><p>If the superior Du Ruo was third, what about He Chaoman who was above her? What about Cecilia Cote? What about the second ranked male supermodel, Nice Clark? And also\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh, Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, who was preparing for the fashion show backstage but was silently shot, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

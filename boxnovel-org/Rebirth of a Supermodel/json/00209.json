At most, they would be released domestically one day earlier, then released simultaneously all over the world. This was a convenience for the Huaxia people. Everyone expected it but even at the midnight session, An Li\u2019s sessions were full!</p><br/><p>Many people booked movie tickets and at the cinema early. Before the movie began, they saw that many famous film critics and journalist editors were constantly recommending it. These audiences were already waiting and now they hurried to see the movie.</p><br/><p>After watching the movie, most people left the cinema with tears in their eyes and memorable moments.</p><br/><p>Some people were shocked by the reversal of the movie\u2019s plot. Some people were saddened by the helplessness of the protagonists\u2019 fate. Some people were shocked by the beautiful and fine video effects. Some people thought this movie had a large impact on the meaning of their lives.</p><br/><p>All in all, after the release of the movie at midnight, An Li\u2019s score on Huaxia\u2019s biggest movie review site, Douban, reached a high score of 9.7! This was after tens of thousands of people left a review!</p><br/><p>Many of them said that they reason why they gave a 9 instead of a perfect score was because the beauty in this movie was too terrible. Look at the leads Fang Liangxiu and Xiao Biqing, their beauty was ruined! Look at Bai Xiu played by Ming Yu. He died early yet he looked old when dying!</p><br/><p>It could be called beauty past one\u2019s prime but they exposed the truth so clearly!</p><br/><p>It was also with the beautiful male god Fang, movie queen Xiao and Ming Xiaoyu!</p><br/><p>In just one day of release in Huaxia\u2019s major theatres, An Li won an excellent audience score! After one day, the national box office was as high as 600 million! It suddenly broke through the 400 million that was Xi Yizong\u2019s best movie result and far exceeded it!</p><br/><p>On the second day, An Li was released in more than 30 countries including the United States, Britain, France, Japan, South Korea and Canada! The box office swiftly increased as an unimaginable speed. Even Xu Yizong couldn\u2019t help his eyes widening once the statistics of the global box office came out.</p><br/><p>1.4 billion!</p><br/><p>This number was naturally in yuan. But in just two days, the global box office was as high as 2 billion. This really surpassed all his movies in the past!</p><br/><p>As you know, the entertainment industry was quite prosperous in this world. Many people liked to go out to watch movies, especially in Huaxia and the United States. The bustling entertainment industry made these countries have a leisurely life. Watching movies was the first choice for many people.</p><br/><p>However, even if the entertainment industry was so prosperous, the record of \u20182 billion global box office in two days\u2019 was something that no one could believe. This was after only one day of global release. What if it was a few days?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, An Li\u2019s box office reached 3.5 billion in three days.</p><br/><p>5.5. billion for four days!</p><br/><p>8 billion for seven days!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Once it was the end of February, this Huaxia costume martial arts movie had a total of 12 billion global office after less than two weeks of release!</p><br/><p>This number was still climbing because the high praise made many viewers watch it two or three times. The fans who originally didn\u2019t care about An Li were now curious to see what type of movie it was.</p><br/><p>Once March 3rd arrived, An Li had a total global box office of 15 billion, officially becoming 10th on the world\u2019s highest box office list!</p><br/><p>It must be mentioned here that among the top 10, Xu Yizong\u2019s commercial action movie was ranked fourth and there were five Huaxia movies on the list. Now An Li had squeezed out an American moving, making it six Huaxia movies in the top 10!</p><br/><p>And among these top 10, only An Li was an ancient costume movie!</p><br/><p>What did this mean? This meant that An Li was making a record!</p><br/><p>As we all knew, modern movies and future movies were always the most popular among the audience, regardless of country. It was because every country in the world had different cultural traditions. Even Huaxia itself had differences in cultures between regions.</p><br/><p>In the case of cultural differences, it was really hard to let other countries accept the history and culture of a certain country.</p><br/><p>For new countries like the United States, which only had 200 years of history, they naturally didn\u2019t have any so-called ancient movies. Huaxia had a ~5000 year history and would release a lot of ancient movies every year, proclaiming their martial arts, history, traditional crafts and other culture aspects.</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, these movies did very well at the box office in Huaxia. But once out of Huaxia, the box office would experience a great dive because foreigners didn\u2019t understand the Huaxia history and culture!</p><br/><p>The situation had somewhat improved in recent decades. More and more foreigners started to study Huaxia\u2019s traditional culture. The more they studied, the more they felt that Huaxia was a great country and that what they knew was a drop in the bucket.</p><br/><p>This was obvious. Even the Huaxia people couldn\u2019t study all of their rich and splendid cultural history. It was because there was too much \u256e\uff08\u256f\u25bd\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>In any case, movies were a good way to research some of Huaxia\u2019s cultural elements. Just as scholars spread the Huaxia culture they studied in the West, many foreigners were curious about this mysterious and ancient country. Therefore, there was a rise in popularity of ancient Huaxia movies at the end of the last century.</p><br/><p>However, the blowup of An Li was really unique!</p><br/><p>First, it was because An Li was really very sincere. Whether it was the beautiful images or the elegant music, it was enough to attract the attention of these foreigners, making it a beautiful treasure that highlighted the culture of Huaxia.</p><br/><p>Second, there were the popular bonuses of Xu Yizong, Fang Liangxiu, Xiao Biqing and Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Xu Yizong\u2019s name had long been known to many Westerners. Fang Liangxiu had been nominated for a foreign movie award at the end of last year and attracted the attention of many people. Xiao Biqing was the youngest Asian actress to win an Oscar!</p><br/><p>As for Ming Xiaoyu\u2026</p><br/><p>The incident with Mudley and Andrew made Westerners familiar with the name \u2018Ming Yu!\u2019</p><br/><p>After all these reason, there was another very important factor that affected Westerners\u2019 perceptions of An Li.</p><br/><p>Director Xu insisted that dubbing wasn\u2019t allowed! They must use the original Huaxia sound! No clips were allowed!</p><br/><p>If the people were speaking English, French, Japanese, Korean\u2026 could this be called a Huaxia martial arts movie?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t insist for many poems and songs that couldn\u2019t be understood. However, the charm of the people speaking couldn\u2019t be expression in any language.</p><br/><p>Even if you didn\u2019t understand, feel this type of mood! The beauty of language lay in the fact that just listening to it could have an unforgettable feeling.</p><br/><p>The trend of An Li was crazily sweeping the world! The movie was originally scheduled to be released in the Spring Festival in February. But this time, Director Xu deliberately released it early by a few days in order to make it in time for the Golden Bear Awards nominations!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t expect to receive a nomination for Best Newcomer.</p><br/><p>This incident really surprised Ming Yu because he knew that in the movie, his acting was only ordinary and wasn\u2019t very good. If there were any scenes that were good, it was the scenes shot after Jiang Kaiyang departed.</p><br/><p>Then how did he get nominated for Best Newcomer at the Golden Bear Awards?</p><br/><p>For this question, Director Xu answered it. \u201cMing Xiaoyu, your luck is really good! In the movies released in the same period, An Li\u2019s box office and word of mouth are the highest. Therefore, the organizing committee looked at this and gave a bit more face to our crew. At the same time, the new supporting roles in the movies\u2026 there are no more than 10. It is obvious that out of 8 or 9 people, you would get one of the five nominations.</p><br/><p>This was probably the so-called dog poop\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, a nomination was a nomination. Ming Xiaoyu believed that it was impossible for him to win the award. It was because the strength of the other four nominees really surpassed him! He was still quite good compared to the other four people who weren\u2019t nominated.</p><br/><p>This time, Ming Yu appeared as a supporting role in a high box office movie and even got the nomination for the Golden Bear Award!</p><br/><p>Who should be the happiest? Was it Ming Xiaoyu or Xi Ze? No, it must be the fans!!</p><br/><p>Before the release of An Li, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans made up their minds. No matter what the movie was like, they must do their best to support their small mushroom\u2019s first movie!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s acting\u2026 cough, they all knew. Jiang Kaiyang said that Ming Yu NG 16 times and this incident was acknowledged by the cast.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the mushroom fans in the cinema were in a sad mood as they prepared to see a miserable mushroom. However, once they saw Bai Xiu\u2019s appearance, they were so amazed that their mouths dropped open and they couldn\u2019t speak!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ahhhhhh! This is my mushroom? Is this really my mushroom?!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I thought that mushroom\u2019s best acting was shown in the trailer! Bai Xiu is so handsome ahhhh! Mushroom is simply too beautiful!!! I was sitting in the front row and every time Mushroom appeared, I almost couldn\u2019t hold back from licking the screen! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Bai Xiu is really poor QAQ. Mushroom, Bai Xiu, the beginning is so hot and then later he is so pitiful, oh\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Beautiful ahhhh!!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>How many supermodels appeared in the top 10 global box office movie?</p><br/><p>Only one, his name was Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>How many supermodels were currently endorsing one of the top five global luxury brands in the world?</p><br/><p>Naturally, there were only five and one of them was Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>When the first world supermodel rankings for 2018 was released, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were confident as they opened the World Supermodels Organization\u2019s website.</p><br/><p>However!</p><br/><p>They might\u2019ve been prepared but once they saw this list, they were still stunned and wide-eyed. They couldn\u2019t recover their souls for a long time!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

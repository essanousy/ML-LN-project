However, he still firmly pressed down on Mudley. It was because this Hollywood actress might be a beauty but her temperament was lacking compared to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this was the result of Ming Yu\u2019s deliberate suppression.</p><br/><p>Now He Chaoman deliberately didn\u2019t lower her momentum. Instead, she completely pushed it towards Mudley.</p><br/><p>The last time the world\u2019s supermodels ranking was released, He Chaoman had been ranked 3rd. It wasn\u2019t to say that her strength was worse than the 1st ranked Cecilia or 2nd ranked Du Ruo. It was because she was too lazy and liked to play at home all day.</p><br/><p>Cough, there wasn\u2019t any gossip about this.</p><br/><p>In any case, once Mudley heard the words, she couldn\u2019t help turning to look at the other person. But from her point of view, she could only see half the face. There was smooth and delicate skin, but the face couldn\u2019t be seen.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman didn\u2019t turn to look at the actress. From her position, it was already an honour that she was deigning to speak with the new actress.</p><br/><p>Time paused for a while. He Chaoman slowly wiped her fingers. Meanwhile, Mudley\u2019s heart leapt and she didn\u2019t dare to speak. Ming Xiaoyu just stood there with a smile, thinking that he shouldn\u2019t intervene.</p><br/><p>The reason why he didn\u2019t say anything to Mudley just now was because he had to be cautious of Mudley\u2019s identity as a woman. Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t a person with high morals but in front of such an audience, he still had to give Mudley some face.</p><br/><p>On the red carpet, Mudley had gone too far and Ming Xiaoyu sternly hit her face. Now it was obvious that Mudley was afraid to have a bad relationship with him and was deliberately trying to get on his good side.</p><br/><p>However, this method was really too inappropriate. Mudley\u2019s posture meant that Ming Yu could see the other person\u2019s chest. \uff1f\uff3f\uff1f\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh, he didn\u2019t want to look at all. It would be good if he was blind.</p><br/><p>However, Mudley had been in Hollywood for a few years. She shook off her nervousness and whispered, \u201cThis lady, I have something to talk to Ming Yu about. I\u2019m sorry to disturb you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudley really didn\u2019t recognize He Chaoman. After all, He Chaoman didn\u2019t show Mudley her face. But Mudley knew that a person with such a noble temperament would never be an ordinary person. She seemed to feel that in the eyes of the other person, she was just as small as an ant.</p><br/><p>Thus, Mudley deliberately lowered her stance and spoke very modestly.</p><br/><p>She heard there was an old saying in Huaxia that was called \u2018reach out a hand to a smiling person.\u2019 Mudley was a well-known new star in the world. No matter who this person was, she had given enough face to them and she wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed.</p><br/><p>However, the next development was greatly out of Mudley\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>She heard He Chaoman give a low laugh. He Chaoman held out a beautiful white hand, grabbed a glass of red wine and asked, \u201cI didn\u2019t know. How can you stand on our Muse\u2019s side and seduce us\u2026oh, seduce our Muse model?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Chaoman\u2019s words filled the air. Apart from Luo Cheng, who was still concentrating on eating food on the opposite side, the other Muse models and photographers at the table looked up at the suddenly visiting Hollywood actress. They looked at the poor little actress with curiosity in their gazes but they all said in their heads, \u2018Angering He Chaoman, tut, it is your life\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>In front of so many eyes, especially under the watchful eyes of many top figures, Mudley was covered with cold sweat. She said with a smile, \u201cThis lady, you have misunderstood something. Ming Yu and I know each other. So I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk when eating. If you have something to say, tell it to Xi Ze.\u201d He Chaoman interrupted Mudley\u2019s words. She looked forward and suggested, \u201cHe seems to be coming back soon. His patience is much worse than mine. Do you want to wait for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudley shook at the words. She hastily looked up and saw not far way, a handsome and upright man speaking to Raymond, chief designer of Rosalind.</p><br/><p>The bright crystal light shone on his perfect face, as if reflecting a faint glow. The next moment! He suddenly raised his eyes and seemed to inadvertently sweep his gaze over Mudley.</p><br/><p>Mudley immediately paled at this gaze, recalling the shameful scene that happened on the red carpet outside.</p><br/><p>In the end, Mudley almost fled.</p><br/><p>After she left, Ming Xiaoyu sighed softly, pulled his chair back and sat down. The moment he sat down, the lady who had never opened her mouth suddenly whispered, \u201cThis year, I took a liking to a dress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was slightly startled and looked to the left.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman was concentrating on cutting her steak. She continued, \u201cThis dress is very much in line with my style. I think it is the most beautiful outfit I have worn in the last two years. Therefore, I asked the designer who made the dress and said I was willing to spend millions to buy the dress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu understood what the other person was saying. But he just chuckled and nodded, \u201cThe outfit suits you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This type of straightforward compliment made He Chaoman look at Ming Yu with surprise. She met the youth\u2019s clear and bright eyes before saying, \u201cThe designer said there was a man who was a hundred times more beautiful than me when wearing this dress. I was thinking about when I would be able to see the model that made the designer so confident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu secretly sighed, cursing a certain man in his heart. Then he said with a small smile, \u201cThe designer is often wrong. His vision is quite poor. Apart from the fact that he can make many beautiful outfits, he really has no advantages.\u201d</p><br/><p>At these words, He Chaoman\u2019s eyes lit up and she grabbed Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was surprised as the woman, who had just been domineering, suddenly looked at him with a \u2018\u2267\u25bd\u2266\u2019 expression and said excitedly, \u201cYes! Nephew\u2019s wife, my nephew is really a bastard! He has a lot of faults. The fact that you can tolerate him is very kind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, there wasn\u2019t a normal person in this family!!</p><br/><p>He Chaoman\u2019s gaffe only lasted a few moments. She soon returned to her former cold and quiet appearance. Xi Ze didn\u2019t \u2018come back soon\u2019 as He Chaoman said. As if she sensed Ming Yu\u2019s thoughts, He Chaoman asked, \u201cYou are thinking, why are Xi Ze and Raymond talking for so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was slightly stunned and then he said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>This conversation had lasted for an entire hour! What topic could they talk about for one hour without interruption?</p><br/><p>He Chaoman looked up and asked, \u201cWhat do you think they are talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man calmly looked at the two world-class design masters and then smiled. \u201cThey are talking about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Chaoman\u2019s hands stopped moving for a long time. Then she said, \u201cHow are you and Xi Ze so narcissistic?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was before, Ming Xiaoyu probably wouldn\u2019t know how to deal with He Chaoman\u2019s condemnation. But after 10 short minutes of getting along, he smiled calmly and retorted, \u201cLittle aunt, do you want to make a bet with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Chaoman\u2019s expression was dark. \u201cDoes this bet involve not calling me little aunt in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, this resentment was so deep that she didn\u2019t ask what the gamble was. She straightforwardly asked what the stakes were!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cThe best is that you won\u2019t call me nephew\u2019s wife in the future.\u201d He added, \u201cEven if you want to shout out, you have to call me\u2026um, niece\u2019s husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Chaoman said, \u201c\u2026.Nephew\u2019s wife, you are going to get me killed by my nephew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu raised an eyebrow. \u201cLittle aunt, I thought you were a fearless heroine. Are you going to succumb to evil forces? If evil can run rampant then Heaven is really unfair!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Chaoman replied, \u201c\u2026You really know how to spur people into action by making negative remarks. I am going to ignore you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The helpless Ming Xiaoyu had to take one step back. \u201cThen you just can\u2019t call me nephew\u2019s wife, little aunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d He Chaoman spoke quickly, as if worried that the young man would change his mind.</p><br/><p>In the next five minutes, Xi Ze and Raymond came over together. Without waiting for Ming Yu to greet them, Rosalind\u2019s chief design master sighed with pity. \u201cOh, you are Ming Yu? I am very glad to meet you. I have been talking about you with Xi Ze just now. It is a pity but you aren\u2019t willing to be my exclusive model. Is this right Ming?</p><br/><p>By the time he said this, the four people had already moved away from Muse\u2019s long table and chatted in a corner of the banquet hall. Which four people? Of course, it was Xi Ze, Ming Yu, Raymond and He Chaoman who lost the best!</p><br/><p>However, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t immediately answer Raymond\u2019s question. Instead, his sharp eyes mercilessly stabbed the man surnamed Xi. Throwing this type of thing on Ming Yu, he really had thick skin!</p><br/><p>Mr. Xi responded with a smile: You weren\u2019t planning on being Raymond\u2019s exclusive model anyway, right?</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t want to follow this man\u2019s pace but he still refused Raymond\u2019s invitation, stating that he was still developing in Huaxia. He still had many shortcomings but was thankful to Master Raymond\u2019s sincere invitation.</p><br/><p>Once Raymond left, Ming Yu and the others returned to the long table belonging to Muse.</p><br/><p>They were walking when Xi Ze suddenly asked, \u201cThat woman, what did she want just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was slightly shocked by the sudden words and didn\u2019t speak. He listened as He Chaoman calmly replied, \u201cTo seduce your wife\u2026cough, to seduce Ming Yu.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

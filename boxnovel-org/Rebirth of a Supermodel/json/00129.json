Luo Ru had contacted Zhao Rui and Muse\u2019s PR department to deal with this matter. It was good that Ming Yu woke up at this crucial point.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s face slowly became imposing as he listened to Luo Ru\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>After a long moment of contemplation, Ming YU looked at his phone screen and asked, \u201cSister Luo, are you sure this Weibo post was sent by Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s assistant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru Ru thought for a long moment before shaking her head. \u201cI think it was his own post.\u201d</p><br/><p>This type of thing was self-evident. Almost everyone in the cast knew the injury that Jiang Kaiyang suffered. He simply broke a leg and used Ming Yu as a human cushion. Forget about being unconscious, he didn\u2019t even hit anything. The one who suffered was Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>How could someone fall unconscious simply by breaking a leg?</p><br/><p>It was possible to faint from pain but who would fall unconscious?</p><br/><p>It was nonsense!</p><br/><p>It had been one hour since Jiang Kaiyang sent the Weibo post. The An Li crew had made no response. On the other hand, Ming Yu and Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s agent team also didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>The entire Internet was still in confusion. Ming YU went to the Muse fan forum and saw that there were many Jiang Kaiyang fans demanded an explanation.</p><br/><p>What could he do?</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu slightly tilted his lips and asked, \u201cLuo Ru, you said that Xi Ze and Ding Bo have been gone for half an hour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru nodded gently. \u201cYes, it might\u2019ve been 45 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu nodded and immediately called a number. Once the phone was picked up, the person on the other end was clearly very surprised. The man\u2019s unique magnetic voice was transmitted, the low sound being pleasant to hear. \u201cYou woke up so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu held the phone in one hand and looked at Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s Weibo. He smiled and said, \u201cWell, it is a bit uncomfortable and I couldn\u2019t sleep much.\u201d Ming Yu paused before asking, \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi was silent for a moent. Then he gave a low laugh. \u201cCan\u2019t you guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man chuckled and his lips twitched. \u201cI won\u2019t guess. Xi Ze, stop whatever you are doing now and come to my room to find me. I have osomething to say to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In five minutes, Xi Ze appeared in the room. Ding Bo took Luo Ru away with a smile, leaving only the handsome man and laughing youth in the room.</p><br/><p>The two stared at each other for a long time. Then the youth asked, \u201cWhat did you do to Jiang Kaiyang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze blinked innocently and raised his eyebrow, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do a lot of things. For example, you can find the PR department of CX Entertainment and force them to punish Jiang Kaiyang, or even block him. You can also not negotiate with CX Entertainment. You can just let Muse officially condemn Jiang Kaiyang and force the crew to reveal the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s voice faded and Xi Ze gazed at him with a complicated and deep gaze. After a long time, Xi ZE sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that I had such a noble image in your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze directly told Ming Yu about his violent methods, that he had obtained evidence that Jiang Kaiyang wasn\u2019t in a coma and took away his phone, intending to post it directly on Weibo.</p><br/><p>After listening to this, Ming Xiaoyu smiled and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing to do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze replied like it was natural. \u201cI will look for Xu Yizong d have the cast openly disclose the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xu shook his head at the words. \u201cYour means are strong enough. The crew will definitely help you. But right now, the person involved isn\u2019t Xi Ze but Ming Yu. If you do this, it won\u2019t be bad for me but it also won\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu solemnly analyzed Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Xi e lived in a high position for many years. In all of the fashion industry and entertainment industry, there were few people who dared to offend Xi Ze. It could even be said that there were none. Those who had capital and were called his friends and those who didn\u2019t have capital, such as Jiang Kaiyang, all of this was decided by him.</p><br/><p>Assuming that it was Xi Ze who saved Jiang Kaiyang from being injured, he could turn the entire crew upside down or have CX Entertainment directly expel Jiang Kaiyang from the entertainment industry. All of this wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><br/><p>Because he was Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t Xi Ze who was hurt but Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xi Ze previously said that he was friends with President Chu Jinjie of CX Entertainment. The other person attached great importance to this issue. He asked Xi Ze to convey his sympathies to Ming Yu and said, \u201cFor five years, Jiang Kaiyang won\u2019t appear in the eyes of the public.\u201d</p><br/><p>This result was all due to Xi Ze. If Xi Ze wasn\u2019t involved, CX Entertainment would send a PR director to negotiate this matter and given Ming Yu compensation. But it would be impossible to ban Jiang Kaiyang.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze could do what he wanted but what about after he was successful?</p><br/><p>There would be countless people who hated on Ming Xiaoyu behind his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is called a full man not knowing a hungry man. If you think about my position, you wouldn\u2019t have acted like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, Ming Xiaoyu raised his left hand and placed it on the man\u2019s full and smooth forehead. Xi Ze really enjoyed this action of spoiling him. His violent temperament disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu said earnestly. \u201cIf it is me, this is what I would do next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Five minutes later, an unknown Weibo account suddenly posted a message:</p><br/><p>\u3010Young Hang Small Night: What? I suddenly saw a familiar person on my evening shift! Is this man @Jiang Kaiyang? [/Picture] \u3011</p><br/><p>This Weibo didn\u2019t cause much concern. After all, it was only a side account and no one noticed it.</p><br/><p>20 minutes later, Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s Weibo suddenly posted a new message.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Jiang Kaiyang: [/Cry][ My assistant made a mistake and let the fans worry! I just broke my leg and I\u2019m not unconscious. I was getting a plaster in the clinic. I had no time to check my phone. It really hurts [/Cry] I didn\u2019t notice that everyone actually misunderstood! Thank you to all the fans for your concern. I will continue to work hard! [/Heart] \u3011</p><br/><p>Nine photos were posted after this message.</p><br/><p>The first three photos were close-ups of Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s broken leg. The middle three were photos of Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s uninjured arms and hands. The last three were of Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s lively smile. He looked very happy.</p><br/><p>For a time, all the fans calmed down.</p><br/><p>It was good as long as he wasn\u2019t unconscious. That was too scary!</p><br/><p>But after feeling relieved, someone asked: \u3010 How was Jiang Jiang injured? Isn\u2019t Jiang Jiang still hurt? Jiang Jiang, don\u2019t worry about your phone. Take a rest and let your assistant manage your account. We won\u2019t worry! This was a sensible fan. For some impulsive fans, they said:</p><br/><p>\u3010 Jiang Jiang is okay. If problems appear, haha, let\u2019s not fight! [/Knife] \u3011</p><br/><p>Only 10 minutes after it was published, Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s Weibo message had been forward tens of thousands of times and there were almost 10,000 comments. After waiting 5 minutes, a marketing account suddenly came forward and said:</p><br/><p>\u3010 Entertainment Circle Gossip Group: Eh? A niche star said he didn\u2019t have time to look at Weibo but I just found something interesting. Do you want to see it? This way \u2192 [/Website Link] \u3011 Everyone took a look.</p><br/><p>It was Young Hang Small Night\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>It was posted 20 minutes before Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s \u2018I had no time to look at my phone.\u2019 In the photo, a handsome man was looking at his phone and smiling happily. This was obviously a sneak shot and the pixels weren\u2019t too high. But anyone could see that it was Weibo on the screen of the man\u2019s phone!</p><br/><p>This clear image combined with Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s sinister and proud smile\u2026</p><br/><p>Many fans\u2019 hearts became cold as they understood.</p><br/><p>But there were still some intense fans.</p><br/><p>\u3010 What is this ghost picture? I don\u2019t understand? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 The skills of sunspots are really good this year. This photo of Jiang Kaiyang, what TV drama is it a screenshot from? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Hey, it is clearly false. Anyone who believes it has a 0 IQ! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>For a time, the fans who spoke up for Jiang Kaiyang decreased. Once there were almost only the intense fans left, another marketing account talked about Jiang Kaiyang!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Gossip Captain: One month after filming started, Jiang Kaiyang suddenly suffered an accident. It is a pity. A broken leg means two months of not being able to film! This is regrettable for rising stars! \u3011</p><br/><p>The fans who calmed down suddenly started to riot again. Some fans who were already suspicious were attracted to this Weibo because they realized that Jiang Kaiyang was likely to be kicked out of the An Li crew!</p><br/><p>For now, let\u2019s temporarily put aside the matter of the Young Han Small Night Weibo.</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang was going to be kicked out of the cast. As fans, they should help him! As long as Jiang Kaiyang recovered quickly in two months, he should be able to catch up. Other matters would be talked about later. First, they had to help him stay in the crew!</p><br/><p>What could be done to move the crew?</p><br/><p>\u3010 @An Li cast, Jiang Jiang was injured while filming. Why haven\u2019t you given a statement yet? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Jiang Jiang was injured while shooting with the @An Li crew. Give a reason! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 @An Li cast, Jiang Jiang is the second male lead. He must\u2019ve shot a lot of scenes and he was injured while shooting. His injury must be related to the crew. Please check the truth and give an explanation! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>For a time, the An Li official Weibo was overwhelmed.</p><br/><p>Xu Yizong was still worrying about how to announce the matter to the public. But after he saw Jiang Kiayang\u2019s fans pushing the crew to the cusp, he felt resentment. \u201cWhat the hell is this? An actor is using his fans to force the crew to make an announcement these days? Jiang Kaiyang is a weak leopard with no courage. His brain is sick!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

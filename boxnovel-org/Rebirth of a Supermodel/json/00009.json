He was familiar with the layout and lead Ming Yu to the 14th floor. Once the elevator opened, the first thing Ming Yu saw was the magnificent sign stating \u2018Character\u2019.</p><br/><p>In Huaxia, first-tier and second-tier magazines weren\u2019t differentiated just from their sales. There were deep gaps in many aspects such as the models invited, the sponsored brands and the international standing.</p><br/><p>Character\u2019s staff led the two people towards the meeting room. The two people hadn\u2019t gone far when they head an editor sighing. \u201cYesterday, Chen made a phone call to invite Xi Ze, but he still declined. Now I don\u2019t know who we should shoot for the cover of our 20th anniversary\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI recently heard that Xi Ze is busy with the fashion year that will take place in the first quarter next year, so he has no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After turning a corner, the conversing voices faded away. Ming Yu and Zhao Rui waited a few minutes in the meeting room. Then several elite looking middle-aged men appeared, followed by a stylish and elegant woman.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s gaze swept over the woman\u2019s body. After a brief conversation between the two groups, Mr. Yang, the deputy editor of Character started speaking. \u201cI have communicated this with Mr. Zhao before. We want to invite four popular new models for a themed photo shoot. In fact, we have managed to invite Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian, who have been doing quite well in the past two years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Deputy Editor Yang\u2019s implication was that, objectively speaking, Ming Yu\u2019s reputation was poor and couldn\u2019t be compared to these two rising models.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui had naturally prepared in advanced so he calmly said, \u201cWe understand your words, Deputy Editor Yang. I also admire Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian\u2019s success. It isn\u2019t easy since they come from small companies. But I think you should understand that putting those external conditions aside, Ming Yu is no worse than both of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s words were modest. In his mind, he was thinking that his model was much more powerful than both of them!</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui paused before continuing. \u201cSince four people are shooting a set of photos, you want to borrow the fame of these four individuals to raise momentum for the campaign. As far as I know, many people in today\u2019s circles are optimistic about Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian\u2019s future. Many people want to cooperate with them. Since you have successfully invited them, this \u2018momentum\u2019 step is already successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s tone was calm without the slightest bit of cowardice as he completed his analysis, causing Deputy Editor Yant to feel slightly surprised.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man sitting next to Deputy Editor Yang took over. \u201cMr. Zhao, you have to admit that in terms of popularity, Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian are much higher. It isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t want to make you an offer. We just need to think again about this contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Ming Yu understood the other side\u2019s meaning as soon as Deputy Editor Yang first spoke. Since \u2018Character\u2019 invited them to the magazine\u2019s headquarters, it was clear that they wanted to cooperate with Ming Yu. So, what needed to be negotiated here?</p><br/><p>Of course, it was closely related to the contract that was about to be signed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui also understood Character\u2019s intentions. He reluctantly suppressed his dissastifaction and said, \u201cMing Yu\u2019s reputation is worst than that of Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian, but they didn\u2019t shoot the cover of \u2018Meditation Road\u2019 or appear in \u2018Lanka\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few years ago, Ming Yu shot a cover for the second-tied Meditation Road and appeared in the pages of Lanka, a first-tier Huaxia magazine.</p><br/><p>After controlling his emotions, Zhao Rui sighed and continued. \u201cSince we have been recommended by Mr. Luo Yu, I don\u2019t think you can doubt Ming Yu\u2019s strength. It is understandable if you only consider fame. But if you put all this together, Ming Yu\u2019s pay should be the same as Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c50%.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s clear and melodious voice was heard in the quiet meeting room, drawing all attention towards him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui looked at his young model with surprised. Ming Yu\u2019s lips curved at everyone\u2019s surprised looks and he repeated calmly. \u201cI think it is enough to only receive 50%. In terms of results, I am a lot worse than Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian. I am honoured to have this chance and grateful to you for giving me this opportunity, so I don\u2019t care about the pay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Deputy Editor couldn\u2019t help smiling proudly as he listened to Ming Yu\u2019s words. Then Ming Yu\u2019s expression suddenly took a shy turn as he said, \u201cSometimes, I think it is luckier to be part of a small company. There aren\u2019t as many competitors, so I can receive more resources. What if they were from Muse? They probably\u2026 wouldn\u2019t rise so quickly in the beginning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu gently laughed and looked very relaxed, as if he was really speaking his thoughts. However, the calm and powerful aura coming from him made people feel cold.</p><br/><p>In particular, Deputy Assistant Yang, who was being stared at by Ming Yu, felt some sweat falling down his forehead. After gulping, the more than 40 years old Deputy Editor Yang trembled as he thought, \u2018An illusion?\u2019 Such aura, he had only experienced it from a few people, and these people were in the rankings of the world\u2019s top supermodels\u2026</p><br/><p>If Deputy Editor Yang was engrossed in Ming Yu\u2019s aura, the lady sitting outside was paying attention to the contents of his words. Chen Rongchen, the editor-in-chief of Character, look at Ming Yu and laughed quietly\u2014</p><br/><p>Was this Muse putting pressure on them?</p><br/><p>Suppressing Yang and directly hitting the key point\u2026</p><br/><p>Good!</p><br/><p>Chen Rongchen didn\u2019t think about it any longer as she knocked her fingers against the table. \u201c50% isn\u2019t necessary. The contract will be the same as Wu Yuzhen\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>This remark attracted the attention of others and an editor hurriedly said, \u201cEditor Chen, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, there will be no change in the contract. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the editor-in-chief of a first-tier magazine, Chen Rongchen was renowned in the industry for many years. She glanced coldly at her own editors, who only wanted petty profits. She laughed sarcastically, causing them to bow their heads.</p><br/><p>After seeing that her mediocre editors had acknowledged their mistake, Chen Rongchen looked at Ming Yu. However, she was surprised to see that the model\u2019s expression still looked the same.</p><br/><p>\u2014He wasn\u2019t surprised at all?</p><br/><p>He once again gained extra points in her heart. \u2018Character\u2019s Queen,\u2019 Chen Rongchen smiled and said, \u201cMing Yu, I only value appearance and strength. I think that you deserve this contract and have high enough standards to make this contract reflect its value. Perhaps\u2026 your strength will give me a surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Rongchen spoke lightly, but her gaze was fixed on Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>People would normally feel twice the pressure when stared at by Character\u2019s Queen, but Ming Yu just smiled. \u201cI want to fulfill your expectations, so don\u2019t blame me if I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>This, the contract signing was completed in this \u2018harmonious and warm\u2019 atmosphere.</p><br/><p>When Ming Yu and Zhao Rui were about to leave Character, Chen Rongchen handed Ming Yu a business card without speaking, then she turned and left.</p><br/><p>As the editor-in-chief of Huaxia\u2019s first-tier magazine, she had her own strength of character. She appreciated Ming Yu, but she wouldn\u2019t do much if the child didn\u2019t make a difference. Every year, there were endless new people with aura in the fashion circles. However, only a few of them managed to stand at the top and enter the supermodel rankings.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui drove away from Character\u2019s headquarters and spoke emotionally, \u201cI never expected Queen Chen to take the initiative to speak for you, Ming Yu. Before I came today, I expected that we would be discussing matters concerning the contract. In fact, my bottom line was 60%, but we actually ending up getting the same contract as Wu Yuzhen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled, \u201cMs. Chen is very courageous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she? She gave you the same contract as Wu Yuzhen, which shows that your positions are equal when taking photos. After this magazine edition is published, people would look at the photos and say that \u2018Character has officially recognized that Ming Yu has the same status as Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian.\u2019 This is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft.\u201d Ming Yu was amused by Zhao Rui\u2019s tone and couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh! You don\u2019t understand. The pay is one thing, but those editors wanted to make you lower than Wu Yuzhen! On the surface, we were talking about payment issues, but in fact, we were talking about your status in next week\u2019s photo shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Ming Yu nodded. \u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui exclaimed emotionally, \u201cQueen Chen is really bold!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The white business car leisurely drove through the city and into the warm and brilliant sunset.</p><br/><p>Six days later, Zhao Rui came to Character\u2019s studio with Ming Yu. They had just walked out of the elevator when they suddenly saw a familiar figure.</p><br/><p>The two sides locked eyes. Zhao Rui was startled, while Ming Yu just smiled slightly and looked at the other person.</p><br/><p>And Zhu Wei stared in horror as he cried out in a disbelieving tone, \u201cHow is it you?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

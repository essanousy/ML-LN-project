It was difficult to completely separate them. Like now, Ming Yu was a model but he starred in a MV. There were also few rare times when a big name in fashion would invite a celebrity to walk on the catwalk.</p><br/><p>However, even though the dividing line between the two industries wasn\u2019t clear, there were still some differences in the fan groups on both sides.</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia\u2019s fans were mostly concerned about the entertainment industry. Zhu Kejia was a late bloomer. She was 33 years old now, but she became famous at 28 when she started as female number two in an ancient drama. Her Weibo had more than 7 million fans and she could only be regarded as a second or third-tier actress. However, the effect of the ancient drama was very good and Zhu Kejia liked making funny posts on her Weibo, so her impact on the Internet was still good.</p><br/><p>This evening, Zhu Kejia suddenly made a photo microblog and a group of people were suddenly heated up.</p><br/><p>\u2026Do you think these entertainment fans didn\u2019t know who Ming Yu was?</p><br/><p>It was impossible!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu had appeared on the hot searches several times!</p><br/><p>The reason for their excitement was firstly, the \u2018Small Mushroom\u2019 nickname! Secondly, Ming Yu and Zhu Kejia took a photo together. Did this mean that Ming Yu was about to enter the entertainment industry and was cooperating with Zhu Kejia?</p><br/><p>It was estimated that the production of the CX Entertainment MV would take a month to complete and the album would release in two months. The company temporarily didn\u2019t release too much marketing and the contents of the MV were extremely secretive. Therefore, fans didn\u2019t know that Ming Yu or Zhu Kejia had filmed this MV.</p><br/><p>Now on Zhu Kejia\u2019s Weibo, everyone was divinded into two major factions.</p><br/><p>\u3010 What is Small Mushroom? I am confused and stupefied! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I don\u2019t want to tell you how happy I am to eat a small mushroom. Ming Xiaoyu is recently busy and hasn\u2019t posted a selfie in a long time. Let\u2019s lick the small mushroom \uff5e\uff5e\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Sister Jia is really beautiful! Ming Xiaoyu is also beautiful! But Sister Jia, what does this Small Mushroom mean? Ah, I\u2019m so curious. I won\u2019t be able to sleep tonight if you don\u2019t say it. \uff3f\uff08\uff1a3\u2220\uff09\uff3f\u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>\u3010 Sister Jia and Ming Xiaoyu are cooperating? Is Sister Jia working with Ming XIaoyu?!!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 In the end, who can tell me? Is Sister Jia shooting a magazine cover or is Ming Xiaoyu filming a movie? Ahhhhh! Sister Jia and Ming Xiaoyu! I have to know! I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re just friends! Say it! Who is crossing into which industry? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Based on visuals, Sister Jia is sufficient to shoot a magazine cover, xd. I don\u2019t know which magazine\u2026 \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>As the online fans were buzzing with excitement, Ming Yu and Zhu Kejia were eating. The amount\u2026 in fact, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t gobble down a lot of food. As a model, although Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t fat, he couldn\u2019t eat a lot. Otherwise, who knew how much exercise would be needed to turn the fat into muscle?</p><br/><p>Before seeing Zhu Kejia, Ming Yu really couldn\u2019t believe that a female in the entertainment industry could eat so much!</p><br/><p>As a northeastern person, Zhu Kejia ate big pieces of meat and took a large sip of alcohol, leaving Ming Xiaoyu very surprised. When compared to Zhu Kejia, he looked very dignified (?)\u2026</p><br/><p>After the meal, some people proposed to go karaoke. However, Ming Yu was a minor (\u2026yes, Ming Xiaoyu used this reason to block numerous attempts at making him drink wine) and decided to return home.</p><br/><p>Many people left the hotel first, while Ming Yu put on a coat and prepared to leave. Just as he was about to leave, Zhu Kejia walked over and asked, \u201cSmall Mushroom. A lot of people on my Weibo are asking why you are a small mushroom. Is it okay if I directly reply to them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Small Mushroom MIng Yu, \u201c\u2026Sister Zhu, you act very freely.\u201d</p><br/><p>The beautiful woman laughed and nodded, \u201cWell then, I got your consent Little Mushroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Small Mushroom Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After the day that Ming Yu and Zhu Kejia joked around, Zhu Kejia started calling him \u2018Small Mushroom.\u2019 The name wasn\u2019t harsh and wasn\u2019t too intimate. Therefore, Ming Yu didn\u2019t stop it and let Zhu Kejia call him that. Even when Zhu Kejia made the post, he didn\u2019t react and silently gave permission.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sat quietly in his car and turned to look out the window for a long time. Then he suddenly remembered something and picked up his phone, opening up his Weibo. The first thing he did was forward Zhu Kejia\u2019s post with the message: \u3010 Sister Zhu is a flower [/flower] [/flower] [/flower]. \u3011</p><br/><p>After it was done, MIng Yu opened Zhu Kejia\u2019s Weibo to see how people were commenting. But Ming Yu had just opened Zhu Kejia\u2019s Weibo when he saw that she had made a new post.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zhu Kejia: Some people asked why I called him Small Mushroom? Haha, isn\u2019t this a small mushroom\uff5e [/photo]</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>He shouldn\u2019t have agreed!!! His glorious image was being destroyed by Sister Zhu!</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia\u2019s new post had a \u2018small mushroom squatting in the corner\u2019 photo. The photo was very good. The light was properly handle, the angle chosen was appropriate, it had an accurate focal length without any blurs, and the photographed face of Small Mushroom was beautiful!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t know that Zhu Kejia had photographed him, he just thought that she would explain it as \u2018Ming Yu likes squatting in a corner when thinking.\u2019 He never imagined that Sister Zhu would candidly photograph him!!</p><br/><p>Good trust!</p><br/><p>Good love!</p><br/><p>Was this how you love your Small Mushroom?</p><br/><p>Compared to Ming Yu\u2019s shame, the response of the fans was much warmer.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ahhhhhh cute cute, meng meng! Sister will kiss the small mushroom! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu\u2026 No! What is Small Mushroom painting in the corner? It is a curse circle? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Selling mushrooms in front, selling mushrooms in front, don\u2019t miss out! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Give me a bunch of mushrooms!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>That evening, setting aside the excited fans on Weibo, even the fans on the forums were excited about this \u2018Small Mushroom Squatting Corner.\u2019 There were even some sisters who painted Ming Xiaoyu as a pudgy white mushroom, causing the fans to shout out \u2018meng\u2019 and \u2018cute\u2019!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu never expected this destruction of his manliness. Many fans praised this unexpected image and his colleagues were calling him Small Mushroom. Forget Zhu Kejia, even Zhao Rui said with a smile, \u201cThis photo is really good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How is it good?</p><br/><p>With this sad and indignant mentality, Ming Yu wrapped a white scarf around himself whenever he went out, creating an \u2018ashamed to see people\u2019 appearance.</p><br/><p>\u2026Later on, should he not squat in a corner when thinking about the plot?</p><br/><p>Well, it was a pleasant decision.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t long before Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t help squatting like a mushroom in a corner.</p><br/><p>The last time Ming Yu came to \u2018Character\u2019 to take photos was six months ago. At that time, he had taken photos were Wu Yuzhen, Liu Qian and Zhu Wei, and their section was the most popular one in that issue.</p><br/><p>This time, Ming Yu completed the make-up and was ready to shoot the cover when he actually saw a familiar figure.</p><br/><p>The two people were surprised when they saw each other. Then Ming Yu nodded gently and Zhu Wei nodded back with a wry smile He didn\u2019t say anything as he entered the dressing room.</p><br/><p>In the past half a year, Ming Yu and Zhu Wei\u2019s positions had changed.</p><br/><p>When shooting for Fashion Entertainment, Zhu Wei was the main model while Ming Yu just got a two inch photo. Now Ming Yu had been invited to shoot the cover of Character, while Zhu Wei was just a small model.</p><br/><p>Competition in the fashion industry was cruel. Without strength or opportunities, you would never climb up.</p><br/><p>After waiting until Ming Yu and Sister Zheng left the range of the dressing room and into the studio, Zhu Wei carefully left the dressing room and headed to the public studio with the other models.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei looked at Ming Yu\u2019s back without hatred or jealousy. There was only a trace of envy but before long, it was his turn to take photos.</p><br/><p>Unlike the previous shooting, Ming Yu didn\u2019t shoot photos immediately after entering the studio. Instead, he communicated with the photographer for a long time. Character was a rising star among the first-tier magazines, its momentum getting better and better in recent years, even surpassing many veteran first-tier magazines. Therefore, the cover couldn\u2019t be freely shot.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu talked with the photographer to exchange views about the theme, as well as to communicate how to express the theme.</p><br/><p>Character had invited the famous Chinese fashion magazine photographer, Tao Qin. There were many female photographers in the industry, but compared with male photographers, there were a lot less. Tao Qin was a leader among female photographers. Her photos won several prestigious awards in the industry and she could be described as famous.</p><br/><p>Tao Qin had an unusual way of thinking for a photographer. She was young and also creative and unique, so Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help talking to her for a long time. They didn\u2019t take any photos and Sister Zheng had to touch up the makeup.</p><br/><p>Tao Qin showed Ming Yu the prepared props and said, \u201cThis time, Character wants to go with an orthodox luxury style. Ming Yu, my idea is to take a photo in the aristocratic elegant style, leaning towards Britain. The colours of the photo will be brighter, and you should try and show a proud and disdainful atmosphere.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, Ming Yu remembered a lot of data about Luo Cheng. For example, Luo Cheng\u2019s father was from Huaxia while his mother was from France. Luo Cheng had debuted for seven years but was only 21 years old this year. Luo Cheng\u2019s height\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026Well, it was taller than Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng might be 2cm taller, but standing in front of Ming Yu, he inexplicably felt like he was shorter. Luo Cheng\u2019s heart tightened as he stared at Ming Xiaoyu. The youth was just standing there indifferently. However, Luo Cheng felt there was a strong pressure wrapped around him.</p><br/><p>This strange feeling made Luo Cheng feel uncomfortable and was both familiar and unfamiliar. It was rare, but he seemed to have experienced it before. The depressed Luo Cheng suddenly remembered\u2014</p><br/><p>This was how he felt when sitting next to Xi Ze!</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng couldn\u2019t help shaking when he thought of that handsome and indifferent face. He hurriedly shook his head and forgot this feeling.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng didn\u2019t respond and then a pleasant voice was heard in the room. \u201cMr. Luo, hello. Can I ask why you came to find me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng\u2019s thoughts immediately changed when he heard this voice. He smiled and turned to look at Ming Xiayu. \u201cYou are Ming Yu yes? I was looking for Rongrong when I received a request from a makeup artist. He was a little busy and hoped I would bring this thing to you. Yes, isn\u2019t this to remove your eye makeup?\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Luo Cheng pretended to not know anything while carefully observing Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The more he looked, the more beautiful it was!</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a feminine beauty, but a refined and elegant feeling. Luo Cheng didn\u2019t know if it was because the youth was too young, but he thought the facial features surpassed gender. Luo Cheng was the vice president of the Outward Appearance Association and had seen countless beauties over the years. Yet he felt that his small model was really very good!</p><br/><p>Look at how beautiful the eyebrows were. Look at the soft lips!</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng had seen hundreds of beauties. Ming Yu could definitely be in the top 10. This was the top 10 for both men and women!</p><br/><p>Next was a slight digression. In Luo Cheng\u2019s heart, there were three names in the top 10 that happened to coincide with the world\u2019s supermodel rankings. For example, the world\u2019s 1st ranked female supermodel Cecilia. In addition, there was the 2nd ranked He Chaoman\u2026was there another one? Luo Cheng didn\u2019t dare mention that name\u2026</p><br/><p>Cough, returning to the topic.</p><br/><p>As Luo Cheng carefully examined the small mushroom\u2019s face, Ming Yu\u2019s reaction changed from \u2018^\uff3f^\u2019 to \u2018\u2299\uff3f\u2299\uff1f\u2019 Finally, it became \u2018\uff3f\u2019.</p><br/><p>This behaviour of starting at a person\u2019s face, it was really strange!</p><br/><p>In the end, the person doing this was Luo Cheng. Ming Xiaoyu sighed and said, \u201cThank you for your help, Mr. Luo. I do need the makeup remover.\u201d Ming Xiaoyu said this and took the special makeup remover from Luo Cheng\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng hurriedly waved his hands. \u201cIt is nothing, just a small thing. I wanted to help the busy makeup artist.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant makeup artist who was ordered not to leave the next room, \u201cqaq. What are you doing Mr. Luo? Let me go back and help remove the makeup!\u201d</p><br/><p>On this side, Luo Cheng saw Ming Yu pick up the makeup remover to remove his makeup. He looked at the beautiful patterns around the youth\u2019s eyes and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIn fact, you really look good like this. There is no hurry to remove the makeup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at up Luo Cheng in amazement at these words. After a moment, Ming Yu suddenly thought of something. Luo Cheng\u2019s appearance was so sudden and something strange and interesting happened at the same time. This led to Ming Yu not greeting the other person.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thought of this and immediately smiled. \u201cYes, Mr. Luo. I haven\u2019t introduced myself to you yet. My name is Ming Yu. It is very nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng nodded happily the moment he heard this. \u201cHello, my name is Luo Cheng. You don\u2019t need to treat me politely or talk with honorifics. I think you are particularly kind. Ming Yu, have we met each other in our last life? The more I see you, the more familiar I feel. In fact, we knew each other in our last life, haha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was he acting so familiarly\u2026?</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng continued. \u201cWe are both in a foreign place and you are a Muse model\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, Mr. Luo. How do you know that I am a Muse model?\u201d Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help asking.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng nodded. \u201cAh, I deliberately looked up your data before I came here\u2026no, I saw Rongrong and she told me that you were also a Muse model\u2026right! She told me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Rongrong who was removing her makeup in the next room, \u201c\u2026Ah, who is cursing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t think much of it and listened to Luo Cheng. Luo Cheng spoke things like \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to meet halfway across the world,\u201d and \u201cI think fate is really a wonderful thing. You look so familiar.\u201d Listening to this, Ming Xiaoyu dimly became aware of it\u2014</p><br/><p>Was this Luo Cheng\u2019s way of breaking an awkward silence in a conversation?</p><br/><p>\u2026No, wasn\u2019t this level a bit too low? It was a primary school level?</p><br/><p>The primary school level Luo Cheng, \u2018Do you have any complaints? \uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b Thus, for a while, the entire dressing room was filled with only Luo Cheng\u2019s praise, while Ming Yu responded from time to time.</p><br/><p>Before meeting Luo Cheng, Ming Yu never imagined that this Muse brother and the world\u2019s 5th ranked male supermodel would have such a personality. He seemed a little imposing when he first entered and this was normal. How did he change in only a few minutes?</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t know that in the face of beauty, Luo Cheng became the embodiment of a husky wagging its tail.</p><br/><p>The Outward Appearance Association had a high degree of distinction. If Luo Cheng didn\u2019t love beautiful things, how could he become the vice president of the association? Of course, Luo Cheng always boasted that he was the president of the association.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu listened to Luo Cheng\u2019s earnest words and his mind drifted away. Xi Ze said he would come today. Why hadn\u2019t he arrived yet? Slowly, Ming Xiaoyu found that this eyeliner was really difficult to remove! The special makeup remover unexpectedly just made it lighter, not removing any of it! It was so difficult to unload!</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng finally seemed tired and took deep breaths. Then he noticed that the youth seemed to be experiencing some difficulties. Luo Cheng looked at Ming Yu\u2019s actions and suddenly said, \u201cOh, you can\u2019t remove the makeup? People used this type of eyeliner on me before. I can help you remove it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaou replied, \u201cThere is no need. It is too much trouble for you, Mr. Luo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng hurriedly waved his hands. \u201cNo trouble, no trouble. It is a small matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng took the cotton and cotton swab from Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s hands with great enthusiasm and Ming Xiaoyu looked at him with surprise.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how this developed into Luo Cheng helping him remove his makeup. He vaguely sensed that Luo Cheng\u2019s attitude towards him seemed to be overly eager. Ming Xiaoyu believed there was a matter related to himself, but he didn\u2019t know it yet.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng took the cotton and beamed. It was because he suddenly realized, \u2018Remover!\u2019 He was going to help this youth remove his makeup! Makeup remover=touch face=eat tofu=#\uff04#\uff04!! (Eat tofu: explanation link )</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng\u2019s mind was active while he squeezed the cotton pad.</p><br/><p>The story that Luo Cheng spoke was half correct. The first thing he did after going backstage was to call Xu Rongrong and ask who the opening model was. The answer he received made Luo Cheng surprised. He never expected this small model to actually be from Muse!</p><br/><p>Xu Rongrong told Luo Cheng on the phone that Ming Xiaoyu was a very good boy. He was talented and his nature was very good. He was worthy of being a friend. Luo Cheng heard it as: Ming Xiaoyu is a good man. Don\u2019t worry about him being bad. His cold appearance is just a pretense\u2026</p><br/><p>It was amazing!</p><br/><p>And then another coincidence happened! Luo Cheng had just arrived at Xu Rongrong\u2019s makeup room when Ming Xu\u2019s makeup assistant came to take the makeup remover. The makeup artist explained the situation and Luo Cheng suddenly realized this was a good opportunity!</p><br/><p>God was helping him!</p><br/><p>Thus, this scene occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecial ingredients are added to the eyeliner to ensure long-term hydration and shine. This method was invented by a makeup artist in Denmark two years ago. It works well, so many people in the industry are using it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu nodded at the words. No wonder why he couldn\u2019t remove it. It was a new product.</p><br/><p>After adjusting the ratio of makeup remove and water to a similar level, Luo Cheng excitedly picked up the cotton pad and prepared for the makeup removal.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ming Xiaoyu frowned. He said that since Luo Cheng adjusted the proportion, Ming Yu could remove the makeup on his own.</p><br/><p>But this proposal was rejected by Luo Cheng. \u201cThere is still a special trick required for removing the makeup! Aren\u2019t you willing to let me help you remove your makeup? We\u2019ve known each other for so long and are friends. Removing the makeup isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, they only knew each other for a few minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>And when did they become friends\u2026.</p><br/><p>The act of removing makeup wasn\u2019t a big deal. Ming Xiaoyu just felt that this situation was a bit strange. Why was Luo Cheng so eager to help him remove his makeup? There needed to be physical contact to remove the makeup. A bit of conflict occurred inside Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Then Ming Yu sighed and said, \u201cMr. Luo, I\u2019m really thankful for your kindness. Please guide me on the side while I remove the makeup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng had a chance to eat tofu. How could he give up so easily?</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng was a man with his eye on the mountain. After a few moments, he said hesitantly, \u201cThis make up removal really is troublesome\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu saw Luo Cheng\u2019s image loosen up and quietly laughed. \u201cMr. Luo, I\u2019m sure that I can remove the makeup well under your guidance. This time, I really want to thank you. If you weren\u2019t here, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s lips curved as he spoke, revealing a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng was shocked by this smile and immediately gave up. He planned to say, \u201cOkay, I will guide you in removing this makeup.\u201d He had just handed the cotton pad over to Ming Yu when he heard the door open behind him.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng and Ming Yu looked at the door in surprise.</p><br/><p>They saw a tall and handsome man standing at the door. His lips were thinned and there was an expression of jealousy on his face as he stared at them.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u00b0\u00b0\uff1b\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh my god, why did Xi Ze come here?!!!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did this feel a little strange?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He smiled and said, \u201cHello, Li Yuerong.</p><br/><p>They were simple words without anything superfluous. Ming Yu\u2019s attitude caused Li Yuerong to be stricken for a moment. She reluctantly smiled and said, \u201cThis time I got an invitation. I didn\u2019t expect to see you here. The remember the last time I saw you one or two years ago. You really have changed a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu asked, \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s polite but somewhat aloof attitude caused Li Yuerong to feel disturbed. But she gathered up her courage, \u201cIt is like this. Ming Yu, we had a little friendship before. Recently, Nidelan has developed a new collection of skincare products and I am one of several first-tier models competing to be the spokesperson. You have previously endorsed the Nidelan Smoke fragrances. Therefore, I would like to ask you to give me the contact details of the person in charge of Nidelan. I really appreciate your kindness. If you can help me, I think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Li, I remember that we don\u2019t seem to know each other very well. It seems like\u2026 we only crossed paths once?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s indifference caused Li Yuerong to be stunned. She saw Ming Yu\u2019s lips curve upwards in a pure and harmless smile, but his light-coloured eyes were cold and icy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that I went to the company two years ago and you met Brother Zhao and I?\u201d Ming Yu paused as he recalled it. \u201cAt that time, you didn\u2019t speak t me. You just said hello to Brother Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu gave a low smile. \u201cThe colour of your lipstick at that time was quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Directly opening this topic didn\u2019t give her room to take one more step. Ming Yu\u2019s extremely cold attitude caused Li Yuerong\u2019s expression to change and she stomped away, not even saying a word of goodbye to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>\u2014She was too angry.</p><br/><p>After all, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t give a senior any face and directly sent her away with the simple words of \u2018not very familiar.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at Li Yuerong\u2019s back and slowly shook his head, chuckling.</p><br/><p>In fact, even if Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s memory was very good and he was motivated to learn all the models in Muse, he still wouldn\u2019t remember Li Yuerong\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>However, this Li Yuerong was the first female model of Muse that Ming Yu had seen when he first entered this world. The female model was only a second-tier model at the time but she was very arrogant. Her attitude towards Zhao Rui and Ming Yu was very disdainfully, leaving a slight impression on Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>In the past year, Li Yuerong became a bit more popular through advertisements and entered the ranks of the first-tier models. She was a Muse model and in Muse, any first-tier model could get an invitation to the party (yes, this was a bright back door). Therefore, Ming Yu wasn\u2019t very surprised that she would appear here.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu had encountered many people after become famous.</p><br/><p>Some were small models that the former owner of the body had a bit of understanding with. Some were peers that Ming Yu had met in the fashion shows. These people hoped that Ming Yu could help them by saying a few words for them. Maybe they would be able to get better resources.</p><br/><p>The higher a person went, the more things they had to face.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was never a saint. Despite these people promising him some compensation, he seldom agreed. These people had a one-sided relationship with him. In this cruel industry, if they wanted to climb up then they should climb up at will.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu also didn\u2019t like to have a clique so he was more disdainful towards this type of thing.</p><br/><p>After Li Yuerong left, the award for Best New Model of the Year arrived. The two winners were recently famous male and female new models. It was impossible for Ming Yu to win because he had actually debuted for five years.</p><br/><p>At the end of the evening, Ming Yu looked around and found Xi Ze talking to some design masters. Xi Ze seemed to want to come to him but couldn\u2019t get away. Xu Rongrong and Luo Cheng were chatting happily to the designers on the Rosalind side.</p><br/><p>As for He Chaoman?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what corner she ran off to but she was probably eating something ?\uff3f?</p><br/><p>This situation left no pressure on Ming Yu so he went straight to another area and found a tall man standing in the crowd.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu held a glass of wine as he said with a smile, \u201cCheng Su, it has been a long time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was shocked by the words and he turned around in a stiff manner. His face was dark and he refused to speak.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was still smiling calmly. \u201cWhy, do you not know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>These strange words caused Cheng Su to look Ming Yu up and down suspiciously. Ming Yu was smiling and really seemed to be greeting him. Cheng Su replied with some suspicion, \u201cI know you. How can I not know you? The newest Yizhi spokesperson, Ming Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was so loud that a few people around them looked over with surprise.</p><br/><p>In the face of such ironic words, Ming Yu smiled helplessly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you seem very impressed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su had been gritting his teeth the moment he saw this youth.</p><br/><p>25 million!</p><br/><p>This was his savings for many years! He even borrowed money from someone else!</p><br/><p>It was all due to that damn Jiang Kaiyang! When he recalled it now, Cheng Su was so angry that he could vomit blood!</p><br/><p>Cheng Su sneered, \u201cYes, who wouldn\u2019t dare remember you? You are Ming Yu, 16th on the world supermodel rankings. The next Xi Ze, the newcomer beyond Luo Cheng, the top star that is expected to break the blockade on the top 10. Isn\u2019t all of this you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had never heard these names but felt they were very interesting. Thus, his smile became more brilliant.</p><br/><p>But to Cheng Su, it was like Ming Yu was ridiculing him! He was laughing at Cheng Su for trying for some many years, using painstaking effort to climb to this position, only to still be inferior to Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s mind instantly replayed Zeng Shu\u2019s words from yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt your current level, you might be able to get to the bottom of the world supermodel rankings two or three cycles later. This result is good. Keep working hard.\u201d Zeng Shu\u2019s demeanor was very casual when he said this.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su gritted his teeth. \u201cBrother Zeng, how can this result be considered good. Ming Yu is ranked 16th\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu looked at him with surprise. \u201cWhy are you still thinking about Ming Yu? He is a completely different person from you, don\u2019t you already know this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu\u2019s natural look of surprise replayed in Cheng Su\u2019s mind. There were many people among the Muse staff, like Shen Xiang, Linda and other editors of the magazine. They all thought\u2014</p><br/><p>\u300e How can you compare to Ming Yu? \u300f</p><br/><p>What? Why couldn\u2019t he compare to Ming Yu? Was he less than Ming Yu?</p><br/><p>The resentment in his heart accumulated. Cheng Su gritted his teeth and tried to force himself not to care about the youth opposite him. However, he suddenly saw a large smile on Ming Yu\u2019s delicate and beautiful face. \u201cThen Cheng Su, do you think you will remember the name \u2018Ming Yu\u2019 for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su subconsciously replied, \u201cI will never forget you in my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were similar to a love confession but Cheng Su\u2019s expression was terrible and strange.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t care. He just gazed meaningfully at Cheng Su before laughing. \u201cThen his wish has been reached. After tonight, I will no longer have anything to do with you. The future things have nothing to do with him. When entering the venue, no one was allowed to bring any recording equipment. Then you can listen to me now\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, you can\u2019t move from this place. Even if you try your best, I will completely block you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he left the venue, Cheng Su still had a dull expression and didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p><br/><p>Obviously, he hated Ming Yu and was disgusted with Ming Yu. How did Ming Yu suddenly want to block him?</p><br/><p>Everything changed too fast and Cheng Su couldn\u2019t react.</p><br/><p>The youth said \u201cLong time no see\u201d only to say \u201cCompletely block you\u201d the next second!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t right! Even if Ming Yu wanted to block him, it wasn\u2019t impossible. Ming Yu was just a supermodel. How could he block Cheng Su from being a supermodel? Who did he think he was? A year ago, he was just a small model who wasn\u2019t even at the first-tier!</p><br/><p>However, a week later, Cheng Su started to truly understand the meaning of the phrase \u2018completely blocked.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Sun magazine also hadn\u2019t apologized, staying still in the face of the Huaxia netizens and media.</p><br/><p>In these two days, Xi Ze was flying around the world and should\u2019ve arrived on ground! He should know what was going on right now. These days were really too busy. Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t notice that a certain man didn\u2019t call him after arriving in London, but was silent.</p><br/><p>After the last incident with Jiang Kaiyang, Ming Xiaoyu had learned several things about Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>This superior man would never use slow-moving means. He was always simple and direct, not afraid of any resistance or defiance. If they didn\u2019t obey him then they would pay the consequences!</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help frowning and started to wonder about what Xi Ze was doing.</p><br/><p>Even if Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s imagination was rich, he wouldn\u2019t be able to think that when the man arrived at Heathrow Airport in London, he learned about the actions of the Sun and the western media. After thinking for a moment, Xi Ze didn\u2019t leave the airport. Instead, he booked a ticket and directly flew to the United States.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang said this but he also understood in his heart, how could there by such an enthusiastic netizen?</p><br/><p>Well, there might be one. The netizen with the surname of Xi was really full of enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>Mudley never expected that the interview she gave would have such terrible consequences. Do you think that Mudley didn\u2019t want to apologize? Do you think that Mudley was so stupid she didn\u2019t care about her future?</p><br/><p>How could that be?</p><br/><p>Once Ji and Ya released a statement, Mudley noticed that something was wrong. Thus, she thought about letting her assistant quickly contact the media. She was so soft. Everyone saw her as a pretty and delicate girl and should feel compassion for her.</p><br/><p>However! Just as Mudley was about to contact the media, her agent showed up.</p><br/><p>Mudley thought that her agent would stand by her side and help her with suggestions. Who knew that this fat blond man would look at her with pity and shake his head. \u201cMudley, this time you really kicked the iron plate. You must accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes! The cancellation of her accounts was entirely planned by Mudley\u2019s agent and company.</p><br/><p>The company didn\u2019t give Mudley a way out and directly sealed her actions. If she stood up and talked then Mudley might not have been condemned by fans around the world. Because she pretended to die, she reached this type of end.</p><br/><p>In this regard, Mudley was really resentful! She contacted the Sun and only said a few words.</p><br/><p>But it was just a sentence. People all over the world saw Ming Yu hold her arm and then walked together with Xi Ze. If Mudley didn\u2019t talk about this matter clearly then what would others think of her?</p><br/><p>Of course, she knew that she had climbed the tree called Andrew first. Therefore, she didn\u2019t say anything condemning Ming Yu. She just said some simple words to the <span class=\"skimlinks-unlinked\">Sun.Who</span> knew that these stupid fans would be so serious and make things so big!</p><br/><p>She was a girl. Was it necessary to bite her like this over Ming Yu?</p><br/><p>Everyone made mistakes. She just accidentally said the wrong thing.</p><br/><p>In this regard, Mudley didn\u2019t give up. She cried out angrily. \u201cMr. Smith! I am your artist. Why are you depriving me of the right to manage my social network and even ban my personal freedom! As my agent, you should defend my rights, speak for me and help me fight back against those who insult me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blond man smiled happily when he heard the words. \u201cMudley, it might\u2019ve been possible if you stood up when the Sun published the first article. It might be too late when the second article was published. But now you have seen the global scolding. Do you think that Hollywood will go against the Huaxia public community for you, a small star?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudley was suddenly tongue-tied and the fat man continued, \u201cMudley, you just watched as the current situation became unrecoverable. Do you think that by apologizing and acting soft, you can pass this situation? But as I said before, you really kicked the iron plate this time. It isn\u2019t the model you splashed dirty water on but the person behind him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudley\u2019s heart immediately tightened when he heard these words. \u201c\u2026Mr. Smith, what do you mean by that? Did I offend someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Smith looked at the woman awkwardly and finally said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know the name of the gentleman. You just need to know that when the president discovered you offended this person, he immediately had all of Hollywood block you. You, it is okay to make a point but you should look carefully first. Some people aren\u2019t the little stars that you have dealt with before. You have to measure their identity before wanting to drag others into the water? Blocking you is the best ending for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence made Mudley stunned.</p><br/><p>She begged Mr. Smith but the blond man didn\u2019t bother looking at her. In Hollywood, there were 50~100 women like Mudley. Did she think she won the Best Rookie award, despite being popular?</p><br/><p>She had been walking around proudly for so many years and now it was retribution.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Smith thought of the little actress he was with last night\u2026 hey, didn\u2019t Mudley also suppress her in the past? Haha.</p><br/><p>Mudley really didn\u2019t understand. Her entertainment company had a top three position in Hollywood. The incident this time wasn\u2019t too much (she thought so). She just let fans around the world abuse a small model for a day. How did it become her end?</p><br/><p>After Xi Ze arrived in the United States, he was surprised to find that Mudley\u2019s entertainment company had a bit of a relationship with him. He didn\u2019t appear at all. Xi Ze sent Ding Bo to face the president of the entertainment company. Once the other party saw Ding Bo, they turned white with fear.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo asked with a smile, \u201cMr. Allen, is your son okay now? Eight years ago, wasn\u2019t it more than 10 strong men? Now that his body has recovered, you should pay attention to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Where did Mudley\u2019s black materials come from?</p><br/><p>They came from the little Mr. Allen.</p><br/><p>Since the nightmare eight years ago, the playboy who walked through Hollywood became a coward and was often sick. He used to ruin dozens of young, handsome men and this was his bad karma.</p><br/><p>But a dog couldn\u2019t change his spots. This playboy was scared of males but he slowly extended his claws to new actresses! In the past few years, Mudley hooked up with little Allen. Through him, she met many big directors and joined the promiscuous circle of mutual benefits.</p><br/><p>Once Ding Bo met little Allen, the latter was pale with fear as he recalled the nightmare from eight years ago.</p><br/><p>He immediately handed over all the black materials he had on Mudley. Seeing this, Ding Bo kindly reminded him, \u201cXi Ze also came to the United States. You shouldn\u2019t go out during this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Allen hurriedly nodded and gratefully escorted Ding Bo out.</p><br/><p>Look at Xi Ze\u2019s character!</p><br/><p>Just his name caused people to tremble in fear!</p><br/><p>But Mudley was a woman and it was impossible for him to act directly against her. Therefore, Xi Ze\u2019s method of dealing with this matter was quite simple. Mudley wasn\u2019t allowed to show any resistance and she wasn\u2019t allowed to appear in public again. All her black materials were also scattered at the fastest speed!</p><br/><p>In just half a day, Mudley\u2019s reputation became stinky!</p><br/><p>Even so, there were some brainless fans who said that these photos might be photoshopped or was just a person who looked like Mudley. Mudley would definitely not be like this.</p><br/><p>But in this regard, Xi Ze calmly gave a few orders and Ding Bo smiled before carrying them out.</p><br/><p>This was the third day since Mudley had been trapped by her company. Don\u2019t assume that the United States was all about democracy and equality. In private, dirty things could keep growing. Trapping Mudley was a trivial matter for the company.</p><br/><p>Mudley didn\u2019t dare escape because her agent told her as a joke why so many Hollywood stars suddenly became seriously ill and left. Even in the years that followed, no one saw these stars.</p><br/><p>Guess where those stars were?</p><br/><p>Mudley didn\u2019t dare to escape. But she didn\u2019t know the current situation outside and wasn\u2019t sad. She thought that was long as she could go out, her fans would accept her and forgive her.</p><br/><p>Until the arrival of the man from Huaxia.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s face looked a bit familiar but Mudley couldn\u2019t remember his name.</p><br/><p>The other party pushed his silver glasses up the bridge of his nose and told Mudley that as long as she recorded an apology, she could go free. But the script would be provided by the man and Mudley must not cry when apologizing. She wasn\u2019t allowed to show grief, only a calm disdain.</p><br/><p>Such a thing, Mudley knew it was a trap and wanted to refuse. However, this man looked at her meaningfully and sighed helplessly. \u201cI heard that the beast that is Hollywood has swallowed the bones of many stars. Mudley, you are still young and beautiful. It is a pity to let you go so young!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, the man\u2019s cold and indifferent gaze through the lens of his glasses stared straight at Mudley.</p><br/><p>This made Mudley shiver and sink to the ground, no blood left in her face.</p><br/><p>Mudley felt this man wasn\u2019t lying. If she didn\u2019t cooperate then this man might really\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus, Mudley accepted and took the apology letter. She looked at the text and her eyes widened. She suddenly collapsed, crying and begging the Huaxia man to let her go. She really couldn\u2019t record an apology video like this!</p><br/><p>But in response to Mudley, the other person\u2019s smile was full of enthusiasm. He said in a cold voice, \u201cMiss Mudley, if you don\u2019t cooperate then I will be very embarrassed. Because you are a woman, he sent me out instead of coming here directly. But if you are still uncertain, I think he will be happy to show up in person. He will talk to you about the Pacific Ocean and how many poor souls are in there.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo\u2019s words made the blood in Mudley\u2019s body freeze.</p><br/><p>She cried for a long time, her beautiful face becoming ugly. After that, Mudley even tried to seduce Ding Bo and asked him to help her.</p><br/><p>But Ding Bo\u2019s face was really cold. He moved behind the bodyguards dressed in black and the latter immediately took out a silver knife, slamming it into the table right beside Mudley\u2019s finger.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo sneered. \u201cSince you don\u2019t want this opportunity, forget it. I hope you won\u2019t fail to appreciate my kindness when you see him. Don\u2019t touch his clothes with your hands, don\u2019t try to rub your fake chest against him. I won\u2019t cut your hand or do anything about your fake chest. But that gentleman is very serious. I can\u2019t predict what he will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Mudley no longer dared to move. Once Ding Bo went to the door, she cried and begged Ding Bo to come back and give her another chance.</p><br/><p>With Ding Bo\u2019s nature, he should\u2019ve left directly. But this time, he stopped and looked at Mudley with interest. \u201cOkay, I will give you another chance. After you have finished recording the video, I will help you restore your original appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudley looked blank, not understanding Ding Bo\u2019s meaning.</p><br/><p>On the other side, a luxurious Bentley slowly stopped in front of News Corps headquarters in the United States.</p><br/><p>A pair of shiny leather shoes appeared on the clean floor. The man looked up at the signs \u2018News Corps\u2019 and \u2018Sun\u2019 set up side by side at the top of the building. Then he walked in.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was only one reason why Ming Yu would be here, making Cheng Su scan him with complicated eyes.</p><br/><p>But Ming Xiaoyu was generous to people. He looked a little surprised before politely nodding.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Cheng Su looked at Ming Yu with a strange expression for a long time. In the end, he exposed his heart as he nodded with an unwilling expression.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su headed to the front desk of the hotel to check in, while Ming Yu and Liu Qian left the hotel with an interpreter. Liu Qian had gone downstairs late and didn\u2019t see Cheng Su. The two people strolled around the small shops in the surrounding area. Once they returned to the hotel, they see Du Ruo registering at the front desk.</p><br/><p>How could any person not recognize Du Ruo?</p><br/><p>She was bending over the front desk, showing her charming back. Liu Qian shouted excitedly, \u201cIt turned out to be Du Ruo!\u201d \u201cIt is Du Ruo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then they were recognized by the other party. \u256e\uff08\u256f\u25bd\u2570\uff09\u256d Ming Yu never thought that Liu Qian was actually a Du Ruo fan. After shouting again, he bowed and politely greeted Du Ruo. Du Ruo was surprised to see Ming Yu and pulled down her sunglasses. The beauty smiled and looked at Ming Xiaoyu for a long time.</p><br/><p>A beautiful woman looking at you with such a profound gaze, who wouldn\u2019t be affected, apart from Ming Xiaoyu?</p><br/><p>The three people entered the elevator. Liu Qian showed the rare performance of a true fan. He wanted to talk to Du Ruo but didn\u2019t dare speak. Thus, he kept poking Ming Yu\u2019s arm, forcing Ming Yu to get a signature for him from Du Ruo.</p><br/><p>The three people separated, but Ming Yu still hadn\u2019t figured out what Du Ruo\u2019s look meant.</p><br/><p>Until late at night!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was sleeping soundly when he felt a feather gently tickling his face!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention how annoying it is!</p><br/><p>It was like when you were tired enough to faint, only to have a husky keep licking your face!</p><br/><p>It was very annoying!</p><br/><p>A good-tempered person like Ming Xiaoyu was awakened like this. But the moment he opened his eyes, he instantly understood what was happening and adjusted his expression with lightning speed. He stared blankly at the person sitting on his bed\u2026 Du Ruo.</p><br/><p>Yes, it was Du Ruo!!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu who was controlling his face, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026A beautiful woman like this, lying on a man\u2019s bed in the middle of the night was a really big problem!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wasn\u2019t able to let out his disbelieving expression. He hadn\u2019t expected that the show would be mad enough to let a woman wake him up!</p><br/><p>What if he had a habit of sleeping X? What if he was seriously upset when he woke up? What if he had terrible sleepwalking\u2026 well, this was too exaggerated. However, wasn\u2019t it too much to let Du Ruo come and wake up him?</p><br/><p>Du Ruo was very calm as she looked at Du Ruo. The face without makeup couldn\u2019t hide this woman\u2019s beauty. Du Ruo smiled and said, \u201cLast night, I received notice from the program organizers to wake you up this morning. Ming Xiaoyu, you completed the \u2018ultimate wakeup mission\u2019 in 10 seconds! I have no way to punish you. Now you can draw lots, choose who to harrass\u2026I mean, choose who to wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why you looked like that last night!!</p><br/><p>Eh, wait a minute\u2026 did you say harrass? You just said harass right?</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>The recording of the first day was \u2018If I am harassed, I have to harass back!\u2019 \u2018Ah, the harassment failed. You have to complete my glorious fate.\u2019 \u2018I was harassed, I should redouble my efforts\u2019 and so on.</p><br/><p>The so-called reality show must also have a script, but the organizers meticulously concealed this morning\u2019s harassment session. They wanted to capture the guests\u2019 natural reaction.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t let down. The eight people showed various reactions, besides Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s normal waking up and blinking at the camera. Liu Qian directly threw a pillow in anger and various other reactions emerged. The program excitedly recorded all of this.</p><br/><p>Later, when the lottery was drawn, the organizers seemed to specifically arrange Du Ruo and Ming Yu into the same group. It seemed like they were interested in making the \u2018Wake up CP\u2019 in order to increase the ratings of the show.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was well-informed in this regard, and Du Ruo also understood the meaning of the organizers.</p><br/><p>Thus, in the next few challenges, Ming Yu was responsible for protecting Du Ruo, creating some pink scenes.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu might be four or five years younger than Du Ruo, but his elegant demeanor wasn\u2019t diminished because of his age. Therefore, even if she knew it was acting, Du Ruo could\u2019t help having a better attitude towards Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>As long as Ming Xiaoyu wanted a person to like him, it could be said that the person would have a good impression of him within half a day.</p><br/><p>This type of goodwill wasn\u2019t \u2018like\u2019 in the sense of a crush. It was similar to \u2018this person has a good temper, \u2018a good-looking person with a good nature\u2019 type of impression.</p><br/><p>If Zhao Rui saw Ming Yu and Du Ruo laughing together like this, he was bound to say \u201cWhere did you get such superb skills with women?\u201d</p><br/><p>But if someone was happy, then someone else would naturally be angry.</p><br/><p>When the lots were drawn, Cheng Su was partnered up with a fixed guest on the show. This guest was a very good person and it was actually arranged for Cheng Su. He intended to make this group have more jokes, making them the highlight of the program.</p><br/><p>But who knew that Cheng Su didn\u2019t have a single bit of humour in him?</p><br/><p>For example, when the fixed guest made a joke, Cheng Su would remain silent for a long time before dryly saying, \u201cThere was such a thing?\u201d The fixed guest couldn\u2019t help wondering if Cheng Su really came to participate on the show.</p><br/><p>The sharp contrast between the four groups made Cheng Su, who was supposed to produce colour, look very bleak. Meanwhile Ming Yu and Du Ruo played up the \u2018Wake Up CP\u2019, showing a terrible tacit understanding.</p><br/><p>In the first round, Du Ruo was first and Ming Yu fourth. The second round, Duo Ru was first and Ming Yu third. In the third round, Du Ruo was second and Ming Yu fifth. Do you know why Du Ruo could second place and not first?</p><br/><p>It was because this round was entirely up to Du Ruo and Ming Xiaoyu could only stand there and wait.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, with the level of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s game playing abilities, don\u2019t mention the first three rounds. In all 10 rounds, he could make his own team member be first!</p><br/><p>In the end, it became a daily routine of the CP show.</p><br/><p>The excellent fixed guest didn\u2019t deliberately throw jokes at Cheng Su. Instead, he often communicated with Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>For a time, Ming Yu was radiant. Once the first day\u2019s filming schedule was over, all the guests except for Cheng Su were familiar with Ming Yu. They even affectionately called him \u2018Ming Xiaoyu.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cheng Su wasn\u2019t stupid and narrow-minded enough to do a cold war with Ming Yu. The two people had a moderate relationship while shooting, without much communication. But when they had dinner that night, Du Ruo found it abnormal. She smiled and found Ming Yu sitting in a corner of the restaurant.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs anybody sitting here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled calmly, \u201cSister Du, you are still acting polite with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people nodded in agreement and Du Ruo sat down with her dinner plate. However, her first sentence when sitting down was, \u201cMing Xiaoyu, don\u2019t misunderstand. Our CP today was just for the program.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Ruo spoke with a solemn face, \u201cYou must not take it seriously!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment\u2019s silence, Ming Yu asked, \u201cSister Du, why do you think I am taking it seriously?\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Ruo was reminded that Ming Yu wouldn\u2019t take it seriously and smiled. \u201cYes, it isn\u2019t serious. If we make this pink combination, both of us will be more watchable. It will be good for us after the program, so I didn\u2019t disagree. But Ming Xiaoyu, you have to tell Xi Ze this clearly. I don\u2019t want him to misunderstand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu asked, \u201cWhat relationship does Xi Ze have with this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Ruo raise an eyebrow and asked with surprise, \u201cAren\u2019t you and Xi Ze a couple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c@#\uff04@\uff05@#\uff05@#\uff04@#\uff04\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Where did you get the impression that we were a couple?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu might feel differently about the man, not taking him as an ordinary pair. However, Du Ruo\u2019s understanding of the word \u2018couple\u2019 was the problem.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo noticed the expression on the youth\u2019s face, staring at him thoughtfully before nodding. \u201cSo, you aren\u2019t together\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She deliberately drew out the last sound, as if saying, \u2018You will be together.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding his own uncertain matter, how could Sister Du be so sure\u2026 no, he wouldn\u2019t ask!</p><br/><p>In the middle of the beautiful and tranquil island, the conversation between Ming Yu and Du Ruo continued. And at this moment, on the Huaxia mainland, the counters, outdoor stands and billboards of Rayleigh Cano were replaced with posters of a new spokesperson.</p><br/><p>The act of changing the spokesperson was too eye-catching. Many people discovered instantly that the huge posters hanging at the subway entrance were different from the past. They were surprised and pointed at the man on the poster. The name of the new spokesperson officially entered the minds of many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cRayleigh Cano unexpectedly changed their spokesperson? This person is called\u2026Cheng Su?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

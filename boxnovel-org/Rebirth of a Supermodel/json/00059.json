None of the dead men had much in common, other than the fact that they were in their 40s and had their genitals cut off when they died.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t cut off.</p><br/><p>Forensic identification found that their genitals were torn off when they were still alive!</p><br/><p>As we all knew, a certain male part was quite sensitive. Among the four dead bodies, one died in great pain while the other three had an iron bar neatly and accurately stabbed through their hearts.</p><br/><p>The iron bars were left at the scene of the crime. However, the iron bars were too ordinary. They could be found casually abandoned at any work site. Thus, there were no clues. This serial killer was very cautious, leaving no fingerprints or evidence, forcing the police to wander around in a fog.</p><br/><p>For a time, the whole city was in a panic.</p><br/><p>In this way, another eight months passed and late autumn arrived again. 12 people had died in a row, so the government could no longer suppress public opinion. The public thought there was a horrifying murderer hidden behind every corner of the city.</p><br/><p>On a late autumn night, a female teacher returning home from school got off the bus. Her home was very remote and in a small alley due to cheap rent. Tonight, she entered the alley as usual.</p><br/><p>The sound of her footsteps was very light and gravel was blown with the wind.</p><br/><p>The female teacher suddenly froze in place when she saw a youth covered in blood!</p><br/><p>The dark clouds happened to be blown away by the wind at this time. The clear and bright moonlight fell gently to the earth, showing how filthy the boy was in front of the pure moonlight. He was covered in blood, with it being clotted in some places.</p><br/><p>The black hair was also stained with blood, but those eyes were surprisingly bright. He was squatting down, looking at the stupefied female teacher with a calm and indifferent gaze. Dark and red blood flowed at his feet. He didn\u2019t look down, intuitively raising his feet to avoid the flowing blood.</p><br/><p>The female teacher felt her whole body trembling as she saw the appalling lower body of the corpse. The young man\u2019s hands were still stained with blood, the pungent rusty smell was clear across the five metres gap.</p><br/><p>The stench was too much and the female teacher felt like vomiting. However, the youth didn\u2019t seem aware of it. He just squatted beside the corpse, watching the female teacher with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>A very long time seemed to pass as the female teacher felt her blood solidify. She watched as the youth slowly walked towards her.</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s expression was still calm, showing no mood fluctuations despite his body being stained with blood.</p><br/><p>He looked dirty\u2014 because his whole body was covered with blood.</p><br/><p>But he looked clean\u2014 because his eyes showed no awareness of what he had just done.</p><br/><p><em>Step.</em></p><br/><p><em>Step.</em></p><br/><p><em>Step.</em></p><br/><p>The young man walked past the teacher. He didn\u2019t stop, just kept moving.</p><br/><p><em>Plop, plop, plop\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Once the sound of footsteps completely disappeared, the female teacher suddenly fell to the ground and tears flowed down. She trembled as she reached her home and quickly locked the door. The next thing she did was call the police.</p><br/><p>On a quiet, moonlit night, a beautiful youth covered in blood suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>This was a nightmare for the female teacher. But for the police, it was a miracle!</p><br/><p>Thanks to the description from the female teacher, they drew a portrait of the suspect and conducted a search through the city. To everyone\u2019s surprise, no one ever saw this handsome boy. He was like fog, suddenly appearing and then disappearing.</p><br/><p>But perhaps because of his rush, this time, the youth left fingerprints on the weapon.</p><br/><p>When the police found the teenager in the slums, he was sitting in front of a dilapidated table, calmly bowing his head to eat. He was eating\u2026 it was just a bowl of rice, but grains could be seen, as if it wasn\u2019t cooked. The youth chewed with loud \u2018crunch crunch\u2019 sounds.</p><br/><p>The police searched for a whole year but they never thought the culprit would turn out to be such a young and pale boy!</p><br/><p>The police snapped at the boy to raise his hands. But he didn\u2019t seem to hear anything. His head remained bowed as he kept eating in an elegant manner, as if he was at a royal banquet with delicious food.</p><br/><p>The police repeated it again and the youth still ignored them.</p><br/><p>Then the female teacher was escorted by an officer to a place close by. She saw the boy through cracks in the wall and suddenly exclaimed, \u201cIt is him! That is him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth suddenly paused. He raised his head and looked through the gap in the wall to see the female teacher. Right now! The youth finally got up, but his sudden action caused a timid police officer to shoot at his left leg!</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s body suddenly fell.</p><br/><p>At this time, the shadow covering the city for a whole year completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After receiving the script, Ming Yu had written a lot of notes and also found Brother Yuan to discuss it. The result was a good performance. As long as Ming Yu repeated \u2018Spicy chicken, you are a spicy chicken\u2019, the director could barely accept the scene.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu and the heroine didn\u2019t have much interactions in the plot. He would often only get a glance of half a face, a pair of eyes or hands\u2014</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u2018\u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d. It is unfortunate that I can\u2019t show my deep acting.\u2019</p><br/><p>If there was something difficult, it was probably the scene where he got arrested. Ming Yu had relatively simple and plain makeup. This time, Sister Zheng deliberately placed some ashes on his face to make him look poor.</p><br/><p>And this scene, Ming Yu NG eight times.</p><br/><p>How to shoot it? The director felt like there was a problem.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s hidden \u2018acting\u2019 was finally revealed at this moment. Once he NG for the ninth time, the third-tier female actress, Zhu Kejia came to Ming Yu and volunteered to help him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia was 33 years old, calling Ming Yu a child wasn\u2019t a problem. On the surface, Zhu Kejia had more scenes in this MV because she helped the police investigate. But Zhu Kejia knew that the core of the MV was Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe song comes to a climax when \u2018I cry out and you get up to look at me.\u2019 Ming Xiaoyu, you should\u2019ve heard the song, right? At the climax, all the tension and excitement are combined ant the lyrics\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood all over the wilderness, the broken tiles of the eaves, the lone star rises from the place where the heartbeat stops, everything becoming imaginary smoke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia froze after hearing Ming Yu recite the lyrics so quickly. Then she nodded, \u201cYes, as you know, this song is about the type of loneliness that the world doesn\u2019t understand, a crazy paranoia. Ming Xiaoyu, can I see your script? Well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia\u2019s voice faded away as she saw Ming Yu\u2019s dense notes.</p><br/><p>After a moment, Zhu Kejia raised her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that these small words are your copy of the script?\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t say that it is research notes, don\u2019t be research notes, don\u2019t be research notes\u2026</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled like he didn\u2019t understand the other person\u2019s expression. \u201cSister Zhu, these are my notes. I studied the last act dozens of times and carefully scrutinized every word. I think the script wants to say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia didn\u2019t listen to Ming Yu\u2019s later words.</p><br/><p><em>Bang! </em>Zhu Kejia felt her brain suddenly become paste. She could only repeat \u2018I studied it dozens of times\u2019 and \u2018carefully scrutinized every word.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia, \u2018\uff08/\u201d\u2261\uff3f\u2261\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534</p><br/><p>Studied it dozens of times? Why? Just look at them with an \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk to you\u2019 expression and act it out!!! Even if the spicy chicken was an aging mother, put pepper and other spices on it to turn it into a super spicy chicken!!</p><br/><p>\u2026 Well, there was something wrong with that.</p><br/><p><em>Cough. </em>Looking back, Zhu Kejia had considerable acting experience. After directing Ming Yu for an hour, Ming Xiaoyu got a NG three more times before finally passing through the arrest scene.</p><br/><p>The whole cast sighed with relief once the director said, \u201cGood, it is over!\u201d After all, everyone had been filming late into the night. After this scene, the staff closed down the set, ready to continue tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia was about to leave when she saw the little youth squatting down in a corner, with his head towards the wall. She felt a rare curiosity, so Zhu Kejia walked over there. She faced Ming Yu\u2019s back and said with a laugh, \u201cMing Xiaoyu, why are you suddenly squatting here? What are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>The tall and handsome youth had changed himself into a ball. After hearing Zhu Kejia\u2019s voice, the youth turned his head and said solemnly, \u201cSister Zhu, I was thinking about the scene to be shot next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention the serious expression. In Zhu Kejia\u2019s eyes, Ming Xiaoyu was like a mushroom squatting in the corner, head down silently. When he turned to look at Zhu Kejia, she almost thought that Ming Xiaoyu would say, \u201cIn fact, I am a mushroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Well, fortunately he wasn\u2019t a mushroom. He was just a mushroom (?) thinking about the plot.</p><br/><p>The young man was handsome and also had very good manners. Zhu Kejia was very comfortable in the past few days, so she squatted beside him and said, \u201cThere are only two days of filming left. Ming Xiaoyu, there are several more important scenes, especially the one where we face each other. For my sake, I want to ask you. In the end, what do we want to really express with this MV?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thought for a moment and replied, \u201cHow to arrest an antisocial personality disorder serial killer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeaching children that it is better to kill 1,000 people than to let one go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave dead bodies anywhere in the middle of the night. Throw it into the wilderness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Kejia, \u201c\uff08\u256c\u2594\u2594\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He is really fourth! I\u2019m not dreaming, how can this be\u2026 the 16th rank suddenly jumped 12 places to become 4th! Yes, I must be dreaming. Come and wake me up!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Everyone be calm, let\u2019s calm down! Let\u2019s take a quick look again. Is Ming Xiaoyu fourth\u2026 hey, he really is fourth!!! T^T He is actually fourth! He is really fourth! I previously thought that Ming Xiaoyu would only be ninth! This is the first time I\u2019m so happy to lose ahhhh!!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 How can Ming Xiaoyu be so good QAQ. How can he be so great? I am so happy for the first time!! I can\u2019t stand it. I have to go downstairs and run 100 laps in a circle ahhhhhhhh!!!! 100 laps!!! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Once the list was officially released, all the fashion lovers around the world were shocked.</p><br/><p>A familiar name was in fourth place!</p><br/><p>Not third or fifth, but fourth!</p><br/><p>The name was so familiar. It appeared in countless Western newspapers, the cast of the recent Huaxia movie An Li and now it appeared again in front of thousands of fashion people!</p><br/><p>A year and a half ago, there were only a few million people in the world who knew this name.</p><br/><p>However, now the owner of this name shot to fourth in the world supermodel rankings with irresistible force! He suppressed the veteran supermodel Harriman Owen and was second only to Xi Ze, Kelson and Luo Cheng!</p><br/><p>What was this result?</p><br/><p>He just became a supermodel and immediately got the 42nd place!</p><br/><p>What was this result?</p><br/><p>The second time on the rankings, he directly entered the 16th place and surpassed Luo Cheng\u2019s record!</p><br/><p>What was this result?</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that seven years ago, Xi Ze debuted with the high-end Ji and Ya show. The next month, Xi Ze became a supermodel. After three months, he soared to 29th on the rankings. After another three months, he directly became the world\u2019s 5th rank male supermodel!</p><br/><p>After that, it was a long seven years at the top.</p><br/><p>Countless people hated the world\u2019s top ranked supermodel and wanted to pull him down from the throne. However, even the most beautiful male supermodel in 50 years, Adenes Clark had no countermeasures against this man. The people in the World Supermodels Organization knew that the gap in scores between Xi Ze and Adenes Clark was really too big.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was the chief designer of the world\u2019s number one luxury brand Ji and Ya and was also its global spokesperson! Just these two identities made him a mountain that the male supermodels found extremely hard to climb.</p><br/><p>Now Ming Yu might\u2019ve gotten fourth on his third time on the rankings and Xi Ze was fifth on his second time. In face, everyone knew that it was unfair to compare Ming Yu\u2019s achievements to Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Was Ming Yu a designer?</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>As a model, he was able to reach the fifth place during his third time on the rankings. This shocked everyone around the world!</p><br/><p>Yes, no one compared Ming Yu to Luo Cheng or Kelson. It was because the speed of this youth\u2019s progress had already left these people far behind. For example, Luo Cheng first appeared at the 43th rank and then he rose to 25th his second time, which was far worse than Ming Yu\u2019s 16th.</p><br/><p>If this was before the announcement of the relationship between Xi Ze and Ming Yu, some people might think that Ming Yu\u2019s fans were too arrogant to dare compare Ming Yu to Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>But now people all over the world knew that these two top supermodels were lovers.</p><br/><p>One was ranked first in the world and the other was fourth in the world.</p><br/><p>This was an unparalleled result in this world, making them the best match!</p><br/><p>Fans had a saying that absolutely wasn\u2019t wrong: These two people are excellent. Only the other person is worthy!</p><br/><p>\u300e 42\u2192 16\u2192 4 \u300f.</p><br/><p>Within one hour of the world supermodel rankings, the global fans didn\u2019t even notice the female list as they started to discuss Ming Yu\u2019s ranking.</p><br/><p>Some people expressed their blessings towards Ming Yu while others expressed envy. The people who gave blessings were looking forward to seeing if Ming Yu could make another big leap forward and do even more amazing feats. The jealous people ridiculed him and spoke bluntly, saying it was only due to An Li\u2019s huge results.</p><br/><p>There was soon the rebuttal of mushroom fans.</p><br/><p>\u3010 He has become the global spokesperson of Yizhi in December 2017, the world\u2019s fourth ranked luxury brand. The number of visitors on his official website has reached its peak of 47 million in January this year! By the way, Yizhi changed the homepage of their official website to Ming Yu\u2019s photo. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 On the world\u2019s largest movie review site \u2018Douban\u2019, there are currently a total of 310,000 short comments and 50,00 long comments on An Li. When searching with keywords, there are 40,000 short reviews and 3,000 long comments which directly contain the name Bai Xiu. There are nearly 10,000 short comments and 800 long comments which directly have \u2018Ming Yu.\u2019 By the way, An Li currently only has 214 long comments below 6 stars, all of which were from Westerners who couldn\u2019t understand the plot. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 As of March 2018, Ming Yu has been on the cover of Muse twice, Suyi twice, Edith once and Bartlett once. Ming Yu has served as the cover of all the world\u2019s top five fashion magazines. By the way, the only male supermodels who achieved this before the age of 20 and hasn\u2019t yet retired is Xi Ze, Adenes, Kelson, Luo Cheng, Harriman and Ming Yu. \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>By the way, by the way, by the way\u2026</p><br/><p>Countless \u2018by the way\u2019 appeared on the social media accounts of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans. Fans used a peaceful tone to tell the story of their mushroom, using the most common words to state his achievements.</p><br/><p>Every \u2018by the way\u2019 was calm but contained infinite happiness.</p><br/><p>It might sound easy to be on the cover of the top five fashion magazines in the world, but one had to know that the photos for Edith, Elektra and Bartlett were taken two months ago.</p><br/><p>During this time, he shot the global promotions and advertisements for Yizhi, prepared for the Yizhi March high-end show, while also flying to France, Italy and the United States to shoot these covers.</p><br/><p>These were top magazines and their requirements for their models were quite high. It wasn\u2019t easy to shoot these covers.</p><br/><p>These achievements were all the result of Ming Yu sacrificing his rest time. He was very good and talented, but he never worked less than others. He actually worked more than other people?</p><br/><p>There was a saying in Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fan circles.</p><br/><p>\u300e In the 365 days in a year, Small Mushroom will be struggling for 350 of them. \u300f</p><br/><p>This figure was a big exaggerated but in fact, Ming Yu probably got no more than two months of rest in a year, this including Saturdays and Sundays.</p><br/><p>Out of 365 days, he worked hard for 300 days. If he wasn\u2019t on a job, the youth would immerse himself in the atmosphere of work and constantly improve himself.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he always performed easily when working and achieved excellent results. Many people thought that \u2018Ming Yu is very easy. You just have to put a design or have him casually pose.\u2019 The designers and photographers kept praising him.</p><br/><p>But in fact, do you know how much effort he put into it behind the scenes?</p><br/><p>There was no need to mention the accumulation of hard work in his previous life. It was impossible for the Ming Yu of this life to rise at such a fast speed with just talent.</p><br/><p>The fashion industry of this world was too prosperous. In the process of appreciating it, Ming Yu constantly enriched himself. Therefore, he rose to his present height and won the attention and praise of the global people.</p><br/><p>Due to the calm response of the fans, the words of the sunspots gradually decreased. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t want to blacken Ming Yu. They just found that they really couldn\u2019t refute these achievements.</p><br/><p>The achievements were all there. Even if the sunspots wanted to ignore them, they wouldn\u2019t disappear.</p><br/><p>The excitement of the world\u2019s fashion lovers wasn\u2019t over. Many Western fans already looking at Ming Yu started to pay attention to this youth.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s global ranking of 16th allowed them to calm down, since there were 15 people in front of Ming Yu. There were only three people left in front of Ming Yu and the youngest of the three was three years older than him! There was only one non-Huaxia supermodel left\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait a minute?</p><br/><p>How did Adenes disappear?!!! \u2211\uff08\u3063 \u00b0\u0414 \u00b0\uff1b\uff09\u3063!!!</p><br/><p>After being shocked fora full half an hour by Ming Yu\u2019s amazing achievements, someone noticed that the female supermodels list was issued at the same time as the male list. On this list, everyone saw that the first place name was familiar.</p><br/><p>Adenes Clark.</p><br/><p>The global fashion enthusiasts, \u201c\u2026?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, what should they say? Congratulations on finally reaching the top\u2026</p><br/><p>What was this? Why did Adenis suddenly become a female supermodel?</p><br/><p>Many people were speechless regarding the World Supermodels Organization. Adenes had only had the sex change surgery a month ago. The organization changed the gender of the model so quickly!</p><br/><p>But after this incident, some fans also said: \u3010 If Adenes was still there, Ming Yu would only be at the 5th rank. This is the same as Xi Ze\u2019s second ranking, it isn\u2019t a big deal. \u3011</p><br/><p>But there were more fashion lovers who said: \u3010 The world supermodel rankings is very different from when Xi Ze first entered it. If you are going to bring up Adenes moving to the female list, then you have to think about this seven year gap as well. \u3011 This little thing didn\u2019t cause too much of a splash and people started to pay attention to another matter.</p><br/><p>\u300e Ming Yu is the fastest rising male supermodel after Xi Ze. Can he break the stagnant situation where Xi Ze is dominating the world\u2019s first place? \u300f</p><br/>\n</div>"}

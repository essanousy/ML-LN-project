At his order, a group of burley men inside the room immediately surrounded them. The big fists smashed into Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s body, each one positioned cleverly. They didn\u2019t hit any deadly positions but inflicted a lot of pain.</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang became dizzy after being hit by a dozen of these punches. He stumbled and saw a man wearing glasses pick up his phone that had fallen onto the ground. After carefully wiping it with his handkerchief, the man in glasses handed it to Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s appearance was still the same as when Jiang Kaiyang saw him once at Ji and Ya\u2019s high-end fashion show. He was indifferent and had an elegant temperament that Jiang Kaiyang couldn\u2019t emit.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t even look at him when he was being beaten up by these men. The man in glasses next to Xi Ze smiled mockingly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t hit the face. Pictures need to be taken and no evidence can be left, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next five minutes were the longest five minutes Jiang Kaiyang had ever experienced.</p><br/><p>Once a big fist mercilessly hit his abdomen, Jiang Kaiynag couldn\u2019t help spitting out acidic liquid and his body lay on the bed.</p><br/><p>Apart from his pale face and sweaty forehead, Jiang Kaiyang didn\u2019t have any injuries and his appearance was still lifelike. Only Jiang Kaiyang knew that he was in so much pain that his bones were loosened. Apart from the leg that wasn\u2019t broken, every other inch of his body seemed to be wounded.</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang trembled as he looked at the man holding his phone with confusion and fear.</p><br/><p>Why was this elegant and noble man violating the law like a bully? This was a society filled with laws. How could he easily beat a person? This person would definitely be sanctioned by the laws. Definitely!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Jiang Kaiyang really didn\u2019t understand why Xi Ze came here. Why did Xi Ze come to the door with people to hit him, why did he take Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s phone and why did he want to take photos\u2026</p><br/><p>Take photos?</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s heart tightened and the pain in his body was nothing as an ominous feeling arose from his heart. Xi Ze didn\u2019t wait for him to think anymore as Xi Ze ordered indifferently, \u201cThat face is too ugly and the forehead is covered in sweat. Give him light makeup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo laughed and arranged for someone to help Jiang Kaiynag with makeup.</p><br/><p>No one knew where Ding Bo found the person but a few minutes later, Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s pale face was covered in powder. His cheeks were rosy and he looked very healthy.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze swept cold eyes over Jiang Kaiyang before saying casually, \u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Ding Bo waved his hand to stop any further action.</p><br/><p>What happened next made Jiang Kaiyang feel stunned.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo suddenly took Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s mobile phone and started to take photos of Jiang Kaiyang. First he shot the leg covered in plaster, then the hand, arm and face. Ding Bo suddenly stopped his movements.</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Kaiyang still didn\u2019t know that this man was the famous gold agent Ding Bo in the fashion industry. He only saw the other person push up his glasses and asked, \u201cMr. Jiang, can you smile more when looking at the camera?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was smiling but it made Jiang Kaiyang shiver.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze had already walked out of the room and seemed to have left. Ding Bo frowned and spoke in a reluctant tone, \u201cIf you cooperate well, I won\u2019t have to do anything worse. My temper has been quite better in the past few years but that doesn\u2019t mean I am half-hearted. I will fulfill any responsibilities, you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s fingers couldn\u2019t help shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, smile. I will take a few photos for you. Aren\u2019t your fans worried about you? You shouldn\u2019t let them worry. This is what you should do as an idol.\u201d</p><br/><p>A truly good star should be a role model for fans. Only a third-rate star would use his fans\u2019 love and sympathy to make them worry and then achieve his goal.</p><br/><p>In this situation, how could Jiang Kaiyang smile?</p><br/><p>However, Ding Bo\u2019s patience was obviously limited. Zhao Rui, Luo Ru and even Ming Yu had never seen Ding Bo\u2019s current appearance. There was no sign at all of the gentle and refined man. His face was too gloomy.</p><br/><p>Since Xi Ze became the chief designer of Ji and Ya, few people in the industry dared face Ding Bo.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo could become a top agent in the fashion industry. He clearly wasn\u2019t a pure person. It was impossible for him not to be contaminated by anything. But in recent years, they had already reached the top and no one was silly enough to fight them or provoke them anger.</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang really hit the muzzle of the gun this time.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo wasn\u2019t particularly upset. The truly angry one was Xi Ze. To be honest, Ding Bo\u2019s words were good for Jiang Kaiyang. It was better to quickly take the photos now. If Xi Ze came back, Jiang Kaiyang would probably face something much worse.</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang didn\u2019t have any good luck. A few minutes passed and Xi Ze pushed open the door to enter.</p><br/><p>His gaze swept coldly over the shivering Jiang Kaiyang and he asked Ding Bo, \u201cDid you shoot it well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo helplessly raised a hand. \u201cHis expression is so bad that I can\u2019t shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow at the words and turned to the trembling Jiang Kaiyang. He asked in a surprised tone, \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s expression worsened. He had a feeling that Xi Ze was completely serious with this question.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Jiang Kaiyang was constantly comforting himself. This wasn\u2019t possible. It was impossible. This was a lawful society; this person couldn\u2019t do anything wicked. It was impossible, impossible. It couldn\u2019t be\u2026</p><br/><p>It was wrong! He had shouted really loudly while being beaten just now. Why didn\u2019t any doctor or nurse come in?</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s suddenly felt like ice.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo knew that Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s road was certainly not good and showed a rare trace of compassion. In any case, a nurse took a photo of him playing with his phone. Using that photo would be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made a noncommittal sound at this. Once Jiang Kaiyang was feeling a little relieved, Xi Ze suddenly took the phone from Ding Bo\u2019s hand and walked to the hospital bed. He looked down at Jiang Kaiyang on the bed from a top-down angle. He calmly said, \u201cI heard that your acting is good. Show me your acting and maybe I will think about only blocking you for a few years.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Blocking you for a few years.]</p><br/><p>These words shocked Jiang Kaiyang. Finally, he couldn\u2019t no longer resist the fear in his heart. He jerked and rushed towards Xi Ze standing in front of the bed. The latter immediately stepped back, allowing Jiang Kaiyang to fall to the ground.</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang begged in a trembling voice, \u201cMr. Xi, how did I offend you? Can you tell me? I beg you, I really didn\u2019t do it intentionally! I didn\u2019t do anything to you. How could I be silly enough to offend you? You must\u2019ve misunderstood. There is a villain behind it who made you misunderstand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s simple and clear words made Jiang Kaiyang feel stunned.</p><br/><p>The next actions were no longer controlled by Jiang Kaiyang. Whether it was due to the verbal threats or the threat of the men in the room, he had to tremble and face the camera with a brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s acting ability was perfectly displayed in these 10 minutes.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo even ridiculed happily, \u201cYour acting skills are quite good. You will be promising after the five year ban period.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence echoed in the quiet room for a long time. Jiang Kaiyang stood still as Xi Ze, Ding Bo and the big men left the room. Once the door shut, Jiang Kaiyang finally couldn\u2019t help crying loudly.</p><br/><p>His body was in too much pain but his spirit had been tormented to the point where it almost collapsed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang cried for a few minutes before enduring the pain and shouting for his men to come in. He shouted for a full five minutes and they ignored him. Then he pressed the emergency bell at his bedside. Once again, the red light flashed for five minutes but no doctor or nurse entered the room.</p><br/><p>In the end, Jiang Kaiyang dragged his broken leg and moved to the entrance of the room. He finally stood up on one leg, opened the door and saw two strong men standing in front of his door. At the sight of him, the two men\u2019s eyes filled with violence. Jiang Kaiyang was frightened and fell back to the ground. His leg seemed to hurt even more.</p><br/><p>His phone was taken away.</p><br/><p>No matter how much he shouted, no one else came.</p><br/><p>Even if he wanted to escape, he was locked up here and couldn\u2019t struggle.</p><br/><p>It was as he said on his Weibo. He might be \u2018awake\u2019 but this state was no different from being \u2018unconscious.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the darkness of silence, Jiang Kaiyang sat on the ground like a person who lost his soul. He couldn\u2019t understand how just 20 minutes ago, he had been looking at his strategy proiudly. He watched his fans jumped forward for him and forced the crew not to substitute him for another actor, as well as demanding answers from Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026everything changed?</p><br/><p>No, it was more like it was screwed up.</p><br/><p>30 minutes later, in the single room on the other side of the hallway, a handsome young man slowly opened his eyes and woke up.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

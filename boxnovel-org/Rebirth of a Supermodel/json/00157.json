They just wanted to slightly smear Ming Yu. They completely didn\u2019t expect an outcome like this. The Western media united in order to resist the Huaxia public opinion. Thus, when the Sun wrote this report, the Western media didn\u2019t say anything or even helped them.</p><br/><p>Now all of the Western media were being forced to make a statement by the Huaxia netizens.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think that the netizens were just talking. After putting forward the slogan of \u2018we won\u2019t end this if you don\u2019t give a statement\u2019, the netizens immediately went to the official Twitter, Facebook and website of the major media organizations.</p><br/><p>Was this a crime?</p><br/><p>Of course not!</p><br/><p>The comment area was for readers all over the world!</p><br/><p>The Huaxia netizens were bringing them attention so there was no need to be thankful\uff5e After all, they were polite and doing the newspapers a favour by increasing the website views.</p><br/><p>As for the comments on the official websites of these Western media groups, do you think they were sweet?</p><br/><p>Many Western netizens came to Muse\u2019s forum or Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s Weibo and carried out a variety of abus! The author didn\u2019t write it out but it was conceivable that these words weren\u2019t good. They were all types of swear words, mainly \u2018fuck\u2019 and \u2018shit.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was called indecent assault in Huaxia!</p><br/><p>At least follow etiquette!</p><br/><p>They wanted to flood the forums? They thought they bought a water army? Huaxia didn\u2019t need a water army! One person could drown them!</p><br/><p>At the same time, the power of netizens and fans couldn\u2019t be underestimated. The Huaxia netizens also spoke up and condemned their international friends in official posts. They didn\u2019t send out a news report. They simple wrote posts, stating that it was a moral issue in the industry and less of a competition issue.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Imperial City Daily: As a news media person, we have firmly adhered to telling the truth since the day we entered the market. I hope the Sun can follow the basic principles of being a journalist and show your attitude to the public. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Huaxia fashion magazine: If even a global magazine is reversing black and white, who can control the future of journalism? We must insist on reporting the truth! Combat injustice in this industry! \u3011 In this respect, the attitude of Muse magazine was quite strict\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 Muse Magazine: As a global magazine, the Sun\u2019s report is really distressing. At the same time, it is a pity that people of the same industry will do such a thing. If we let this type of character spread in the industry, it won\u2019t last! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If the power of the netizens was a huge stone that hit the door of the Western media, then the condemnation of the Huaxia media was like swords that stabbed and drew blood!</p><br/><p>In fact, there was a reason why the Huaxia media unified this time to speak up for Ming YU. In addition to the PR department of Muse, they wanted to use this opportunity to strike against the \u2018self-righteous\u2019 Western media trying to compete with Huaxia.</p><br/><p>There was a saying that if you don\u2019t dare to move, we won\u2019t take you in our hearts.</p><br/><p>But since you were so annoying and kept committing crimes, then we will use a bit of effort to slap you in the face.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t underestimate the power of Huaxia media in the global public opinion circle. This superpower had one-fifth of the world\u2019s population. The total amount of news generated every day was almost one-third of Western media. The circulation was even half of Western media.</p><br/><p>This was why the Western media had to tremble and try to cling obstinately to their property.</p><br/><p>Let us mourn for them for one second.</p><br/><p>Okay, the silence ended. Don\u2019t waste even a millisecond.</p><br/><p>Now the most troublesome thing in the entire media world was the Sun and the newspapers associated with them. As for the Western entertainment industry, Mudley was repeatedly rebuked by the Huaxia fans. Many European and American netizens who had a conscience also asked her to stand up and apologize.</p><br/><p>However, Mudley was completely silent after the Sun published their first article.</p><br/><p>Until now, Mudley was pretending to be dead! The latest update on her Twitter was three days ago. She was supposed to be on a talk show today but she called off sick and didn\u2019t appear in public.</p><br/><p>This type of evasive behaviour made the netizens even more furious! Do you know the art of swearing? Do you know the art of \u2018pushing into a fire pit and still not receiving anything\u2019?</p><br/><p>Since she isn\u2019t saying anything, good! Then don\u2019t blame us for doing too much!</p><br/><p>For a time, the netizens bombarded Mudley\u2019s social networks asking her to apologize. Many netizens also moved to the official website of the movie Mudley would be participating in and urged the crew to give a statement.</p><br/><p>We have given you a chance but you don\u2019t want to face us! Since you are showing no face, we won\u2019t be polite!</p><br/><p>Do you know where the world\u2019s largest movie market was?</p><br/><p>It was Huaxia.</p><br/><p>Hollywood movies were the only ones that could compete in Huaxia. It was because Huaxia still ate up the superhero movies. In the case of watching movies, it was no problem to occasionally adjust their own taste.</p><br/><p>Now that the Hollywood actress had turned against their Huaxia model, let\u2019s see who would watch the movie?</p><br/><p>Did you think you are a master?</p><br/><p>Look at the global movie box office, six of the top ten were Huaxia movies!</p><br/><p>Under such strong public pressure, Mudley\u2019s movie released an official statement half a day later: \u3010 There is some discrepancy between Mudley Joyce\u2019s appearance and Super Rescue. The crew has decided to temporarily dismiss Mudley Joyce and once again recruit a new actress from around the world. \u3011</p><br/><p>Seeing this result, those who were calling to boycott Super Rescue could only bitterly forget. Everyone secretly thought, \u2018Hey, you are smart. You understand the good and bad. We reluctantly won\u2019t resist you but are too lazy to watch you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Poor Super Rescue. Simply because they didn\u2019t declare their position fast enough, they lost a lot of box office in Huaxia. But for these fans originally only wanted to casually watch a foreign movie along with their domestic movies. It didn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t watch it. Therefore, who knew if Super Rescue would be eligible to enter the Huaxia market.</p><br/><p>This type of public pressure was really strong.</p><br/><p>Many netizens didn\u2019t understand why Mudley was acting like she was invincible. To pour oil on the fire, they were stunned when refreshing Mudley\u2019s social media page. It was because these words appeared:</p><br/><p>[The account has been cancelled.]</p><br/><p>\u2026What a surprise!</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>Forget about giving an apology or a statement?</p><br/><p>She craftily escaped, thinking she could escape death?</p><br/><p>This shameless behaviour really made the Huaxia netizens furious and the European and American netizens paralyzed. Apart from some of Mudley\u2019s brainless fans, the others couldn\u2019t comment at all.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this too unreasonable? She pretended she was dead and now she cancelled her accounts?</p><br/><p>This time, the angry netizens didn\u2019t give Mudley a way out. They directly went to the studio that Mudley was signed to, insisting that the other party give a statement. At the same time, some Huaxia entertainment media slammed Mudley\u2019s behaviour of escaping, accusing her of \u2018having a guilty conscience and fleeing.\u2019</p><br/><p>The studio Mudley was contracted to hadn\u2019t yet responded. The entertainment company affiliated to the studio immediately spoke, stating that Mudley wasn\u2019t in a good physical condition. She would temporarily suspend all activities and asked the fans to patiently wait.</p><br/><p>Did this scene look familiar?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this statement a bit familiar?</p><br/><p>This was the official rhetoric of CX Entertainment after Jiang Kaiyang shamelessly used his fans to slander Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, the angry Huaxia netizens slightly had their fire put out. After all, they understood that there were no more traces of the previous \u2018bad\u2019 Jiang Kaiyang. Even the reality that he already shot removed all his clips and said that Jiang Kaiyang was too busy for the recording.</p><br/><p>Mudley\u2019s ending could already be imagined but no one felt sorry for the actress. That\u2019s why everyone was caught off guard when Mudley\u2019s black materials were released. They overwhelmed fans all over the world. The black material were too much to imagine! Even the people who hated Mudley were stunned stupid, taking a moment to understand what happened.</p><br/><p>It was said that Mudley combined with the Sun\u2019s slander against Ming Xiaoyu was a 1000000 point crit, making the Huaxia netizens and Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans furious. Now these black materials were like a super-ultra crit of 10000000\u2026\u202600000! Don\u2019t mention those who hated Mudley, even the fans who liked her were completely stunned.</p><br/><p>Climbing Director XX\u2019s be to get a character.</p><br/><p>Bullying a new person in the cast and making them suffer from depression. In order to get an award, buying off a media reporter to pour dirty water on her competitors. There was also drugs and the most terrible thing that everyone couldn\u2019t accept\u2014</p><br/><p>A sex party!!!!!</p><br/><p>A beautiful actress on the screen would participate in such a terrible sex party! Along with this piece of news, there were many photos released. The other people had mosaics on their faces but Mudley\u2019s face was clear! This expression of lust and ecstasy was really disgusting!</p><br/><p>Then a netizen observing the photo suddenly found: \u3010 Eh? I know this old man! His face has a mosaic but he has a tattoo on his arm! He is Director XXX who died last year due to AIDS!!! \u3011 This was a super big news that caused waves around the world.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in Muse\u2019s PR department, Zhao Rui looked at Shen Xiang in surprised and asked, \u201cShen Xiang, you still have this power? I couldn\u2019t see it at all. How could you find such rotten black material?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang smoked a cigarette. \u201cThis matter has nothing to do with me! It is the explosive tip of an enthusiastic netizen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui had a disbelieving expression on his face.</p><br/><p>But Ming Xiaoyu carefully looked at these black materials and had a thought. He smiled and left the Muse PR department. He went to the balcony next door and started to call a certain man.</p><br/><p>However, Ming Xiaoyu was surprised that when he called, the phone was turned off.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t know that some things couldn\u2019t be stopped so easily.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze had a very small tolerance and he was always serious with his protection. How could he just stop?</p><br/><p>It was a fantasy!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

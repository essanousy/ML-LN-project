Every time, the organizer was bound to be a world-famous top luxury brand. At the same time, it invited famous supermodels, designers, entertainment stars, directors and major giants from other industries to the party.</p><br/><p>At this party, you might see the world\u2019s most famous top models. You might also see sports champions who just won the Olympic gold medal. You might see the world\u2019s most beautiful actress or meet prestigious ladies.</p><br/><p>Not every industry\u2019s top figures and celebrities could get an invitation from the RAmer Charity Gala. But as long as they received an invitation, they were sure to be leaders of their industry.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Ming Yu was somewhat surprised when he received this invitation. You know, the invitation list for the RAmer Charity Gala was decided in the first half of the year. He suddenly received an invitation one month before the party?</p><br/><p>However, Luo Cheng answered this question. \u201cMing Yu, your invitation was set up as an invisible invitation in the first half of the year. As long as you became a supermodel before the party, this invitation would be delivered to you. If you didn\u2019t, this invitation would be void.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please note that an invitation letter could be sold for a huge 100,000 yuan on the outside and it couldn\u2019t be easily bought. Ming Yu didn\u2019t expect that Rosalind would be so optimistic about him, directly giving him an invitation for no reason.</p><br/><p>However, Xi Ze wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cI have a good relationship with Rosalind\u2019s chief designer, Raymond.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu raised an eyebrow at these words. \u201cWhat do you mean? He saw your face and gave me an invitation letter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked the youth up and down then smiled. \u201cDo you have no confidence in yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu retorted, \u201cI have no confidence in your evil intentions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze sighed and said like he was wronged. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know my relationship with you. Raymond is a very sinister person. Cecilia is a good seed that he dug up. He probably values your potential very much. If I\u2019m not wrong, he will take the initiative to talk to you at this dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cecilia Cote, the world\u2019s number one female supermodel.</p><br/><p>This angel supermodel was only 20 years old but she had become the dream goddess of countless people around the world. Cecilia\u2019s qualifications were indeed very good. But some of her dazzling achievements were related to Rosalind\u2019s chief designer Raymond, who she had a connection with.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was curious when he heard this. \u201cMr. Raymond has Cecilia Cote. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The implication was that the world\u2019s top designers would raise excellent models. Often, these models would be their favourites and often model for them.</p><br/><p>However, Xi Ze was a top master of the same level and didn\u2019t seem to have a favourite model.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t expect this handsome and indifferent man to look at him with a sad look before sighing. \u201cIn November of last year, I wanted to raise a small model into the sky. But the model disliked me and refused me harshly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Small model Ming Yu, \u201c^_^ #\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t stop sighing. \u201cRaymond has Cecilia, Essarica has Adenes and I have nothing. Aren\u2019t I pitiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu sneered at him and said, \u201cWhy do you need someone else? Mr. Xi, aren\u2019t you enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze immediately held the youth\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else. I want you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This type of sweet talk was very useful. By the time the plane landed, Ming Xiaoyu was no longer so angry. The two people continued talking and laughing. Zhao Rui and Luo Ru, who slept all the way, were surprised at the sight. They could only look at each other helplessly.</p><br/><p>After resting in the United States for two days, the annual RAmer Charity Gala was finally about to begin.</p><br/><p>Since this was called a charity party, it must be held for a charity. Every year, the guests and investors who attended this charity evening would donate a huge amount of money to repair several famous art museums around the world.</p><br/><p>This year\u2019s RAmer Charity Gala was hosted by the top luxury brand, Rosalind. Perhaps because this year the brand hired a supermodel from Huaxia, Luo Cheng as the global spokesperson. The theme of this charity party was\u2014</p><br/><p>\u300e Huaxia: Millennium Feng Shui, Bright Treasures. \u300f</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t underestimate this theme. Every year, the RAmer Charity Gala would announce the theme of the party at the same time of the invitations. It was because they needed to let the attendees know what type of clothes they needed to wear and the type of makeup to be shown at the party.</p><br/><p>Yes, the party theme was the clothing theme for every guest present.</p><br/><p>Some guests with numerous high-end clothing didn\u2019t have to worry about this problem because they had too many outfits. Even if the theme was too remote, they could find an outfit that suited it. But for some guests, they would need to borrow an outfit and or contact the studio to customize their outfit.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t an ordinary charity party. It was a feast of fashion and jewelry.</p><br/><p>Originally after accepting the invitation, Ming Yu planned to wear the outfit designed by Fei Sixin to the party.</p><br/><p>This \u2018Millennium Feng Shui\u2019 seemed a bit strange and some people couldn\u2019t guess what it meant. But the theme of Huaxia and Bright Treasures was completely covered by Fei Sixin\u2019s outfit.</p><br/><p>There were strings of crystal clear diamonds on the outfit, like it was born for this party.</p><br/><p>However, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t end up bring the outfit. When he was packing his luggage, he took the outfit out of his cloakroom and intended to let Luo Ru take it away the next day. She would prepare it to be taken to the United States.</p><br/><p>But when he took it out, his idle neighbour Xi Ze saw it!</p><br/><p>The neighbour asked with dissatisfaction. \u201cAre you going to wear this outfit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu replied naturally. \u201cYes, this outfit is very beautiful and also very suitable for the theme.\u201d The most important thing was that he three high-end outfits in total. One was the outfit Xi Ze previously gave me, one he bought later and the last one was\u2026</p><br/><p>The words were too awkward to say. Ming Xiaoyu was deeply saddened and didn\u2019t say it.</p><br/><p>Bu Xi Ze looked very dissatisfied. \u201cHow can you wear a woman\u2019s clothing in front of my face to go to the party?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was also attending the party so he didn\u2019t say anything wrong.</p><br/><p>However, the young man raised his eyebrows disdainfully at the words and asked. \u201cWhat is \u2018wearing an outfit by a woman\u2019? There will be no problem if I wear an outfit made by a male designer? Hey, you are still sexist Mr. Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s mouth slightly twitched. \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was impossible for Xi Ze to be like this. He definitely didn\u2019t discriminate by gender. Even if it was an outfit by a male designer, it couldn\u2019t be worn!</p><br/><p>His own lover, his muse was attending the same party and he was wearing clothes designed by others!</p><br/><p>Was this appropriate?</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>This was simply hitting him in the face!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t allowed! Absolutely not!</p><br/><p>But even if Mr. Xi didn\u2019t allow it, there would only be a week or so left before the party started. In the face of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s \u2018I will ignore you\u2019, Mr. Xi solemnly brought together all the designers and tailors of Ji and Ya and held a meeting.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu naturally didn\u2019t know about this meeting. He only knew that six days later, he received an exquisite high-end outfit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you make an outfit so soon? It is impossible. It was only six days!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly shook his head and said, \u201cIn front of me, there is nothing impossible in the world. But you wearing another person\u2019s outfit while attending the same party as me, that is the last thing I want to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu looked the man up and down with suspicion. But Xi Ze just stood there and acted casually, as if it was just a trivial matter.</p><br/><p>In the end, Ming Yu didn\u2019t receive an explanation. He only thought that Xi Ze had been hiding an outfit since long ago.</p><br/><p>He certainly didn\u2019t think that in the past six days, all the best designers and tailors of Ji and Ya experienced six days of darkness.</p><br/><p>The value of this outfit was around one million yuan. The materials were one thing but the work was even more exquisite. The time limit was quite short but these masters didn\u2019t cut corners. They solemnly carried out each process to ensure that the outfit was seamless.</p><br/><p>There was no reason for it. It was just that their admirable chief designer spoke in a pleading tone they had never seen before. He said quite seriously:</p><br/><p>\u300e Elder Chen, Elder Li, Alice, Ding Shu, Emile\u2026 I have been with Ji and Ya for more than 10 years and you also watched me grow up. Tell me, how can I watch my lover wear someone else\u2019s outfit and walk on the red carpet of the RAmer party? \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e This will be the ultimate event of my life! \u300f</p><br/><p>\u2014What was Xi Ze saying?</p><br/><p>\u2014An ultimate event? It was just an outfit!</p><br/><p>Although both the author and readers thought so (?), Elder Chen, Elder Li and the other designers and tailors didn\u2019t think so.</p><br/><p>The RAmer Charity Gala was the top feast of the fashion world! If the lover of a top design master wore an outfit designed by someone else at such a party, it would definitely shame Xi Ze. It would definitely shame Ji and Ya!</p><br/><p>What was a week?</p><br/><p>It was a day! They also had to make an outfit\u2026well, it wouldn\u2019t come out in a day.</p><br/><p>If Rosalind was really so crazy as to send an invitation letter the day before, they would lose their face in front of Xi Ze. Anyway, no one knew who his lover was\u2026 wait a minute? They didn\u2019t kow who Xi Ze\u2019s lover was!</p><br/><p>The moment they saw the person wearing this outfit, they would know who Xi Ze\u2019s lover was. The group of masters were seriously excited and spent six days in the studio making the outfit with Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>On September 15th, 2017, the eyes of the world were placed on New York, USA.</p><br/><p>Everyone was looking forward to the appearance of famous celebrities in this fashion feast.</p><br/><p>Of course, they didn\u2019t know that in the famous Ji and Ya studio, all the masters were waiting to know: In the end, who is Xi Ze\u2019s lover? o\uff08*\u2267\u25bd\u2266\uff09\u30c4\uff5e\uff01</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then that person might walk easily on the path of business and reach a high position, but this didn\u2019t mean they would become the second richest person in Huaxia.</p><br/><p>This phenomenon was more evident in the fashion and entertainment industries.</p><br/><p>Many second generation stars might be able to take advantage of their elders\u2019 superior resources to film large-scale production and big investment movies as soon as they debuted. But who said they could become a big star by appearing in a big movie? They were starting at a much higher place than others but that didn\u2019t mean they could rise higher.</p><br/><p>For example, the world\u2019s second ranked male supermodel Kelson had much worse debut conditions than Luo Cheng. But over the years, he firmly pressed on Luo Cheng\u2019s head. With his strength and achievements, he stopped Luo Cheng from going any further.</p><br/><p>In any case, everyone admitted that after Xi Ze, Ming Yu was the fastest growing supermodel in the world. The only one with a hope of surpassing Xi Ze must be Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>But beyond this, some people raised concerns: \u3010 Due to the existence of God Xi, Adenes has been stuck at second place for five or six years. Now that Adenes is transgender, she directly reached the top of the women\u2019s list. This shows that God Xi is truly the world\u2019s first supermodel. Can Mushroom really surpassed God Xi _ (: \u0417\u201d\u2220)_ \u3011</p><br/><p>It was natural for fans to worry about this. But it was just a thought for most people. After all, the two identities of chief designer and global spokesperson of Ji and Ya was enough to make Xi Ze beyond any other supermodel.</p><br/><p>Even if Ming Xiaoyu lost, it wasn\u2019t shameful. Wasn\u2019t it losing to his husband?</p><br/><p>Cough, this was picking a fight for nothing. What could be done? They lost to God Xi who had the identity of a supermodel and a designer!</p><br/><p>This announcement of the world\u2019s supermodel rankings sparked a heated debated in the global fashion industry. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were celebrating their mushroom\u2019s great leap forward while other people were curious about Ming Yu\u2019s final ranking. As for Xi Ze\u2019s fans\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 In the past, I had a look of disdain when people said that a certain model has the qualification to surpass God Xi. But when I think about God Xi\u2019s wife, I hope that he will surpass God Xi. I feel so touched 233333 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Yes, if Ming Yu really surpasses him, what will God Xi\u2019s expression be? He was pushed down by his wife \uff5e\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 There should be a story here: \u201cDarling, this time you were under me on the rankings. At night, you will continue to be pressed under me.\u201d At night. \u201cAh, didn\u2019t mean it to be this type of \u2018underneath\u2019 me.\u201d\uff5e\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Hey, why are you so dirty. Just a group of dirty women! But hurry and send me one, 23333333 \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Whether it was Ming Yu\u2019s great leap forward or Adenes topping the female list, there was big news in the fashion industry. A hot discussion was sparked that lasted for a long time before slowly subsiding.</p><br/><p>At the Golden Bear Awards at the end of March, there was no accidents. Ming Yu didn\u2019t get the Best Newcomer Award, he just attended the ceremony. By the way, the An Li cast got Best Movie, Best Actor, Best Special Effects, Best Original Script and many other awards.</p><br/><p>At the end of March, as a global spokesperson of Yizhi, Ming Yu was invited to serve as the finale model for the Yizhi 2019 spring/summer high-end show.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was only 16th on the rankings when he became the global spokesperson.</p><br/><p>At that time, many industry brands saw Yizhi as a joke. As one of the top five luxury brands in the world, they didn\u2019t ask for a corresponding supermodel. Instead, they found someone outside of the top 10. This was enough to make people laugh.</p><br/><p>There were many reasons for the ridicule. What would Yizhi do if the ranking dropped next time? For Ming Yu to unexpectedly be hired as Yizhi\u2019s global spokesperson, what type of back door did he have (at the time, Ming Yu and Xi Ze\u2019s relationship wasn\u2019t exposed).</p><br/><p>Once the new round of world supermodel rankings were released, these sarcastic people were forced to close their mouths.</p><br/><p>The higher the ranking, the more difficult it was to progress! For example, Luo Cheng reached the 5th place four years ago. But it took him three years to go beyond Harriman Owen above him.</p><br/><p>This time, Ming Yu progressed directly from 16th place to 4th place. He already brutally slapped the faces of these snobs with his results! If he couldn\u2019t be the global spokesperson of Yizhi, who could?</p><br/><p>The relationship between Ming Yu and Yizhi was mutually beneficial.</p><br/><p>Yizhi chose him as a spokesperson, allowing Ming Yu\u2019s score calculated by the World Supermodels Organization to increase. Ming Yu\u2019s score became very high, allowing him to have amazing results, which made more people notice him. This shone light on his endorsement of Yizhi.</p><br/><p>Now the eyes of the global fashion industry were concentrated on Yizhi\u2019s 2018 spring/summer show.</p><br/><p>Whether it was the chief editor of a top magazine, a top photographer, a chief designer of a luxury brand or a world supermodel, they all focused their eyes on Yizhi and waited for the beginning of a grand fashion show.</p><br/><p>This time, Yizhi\u2019s performance didn\u2019t disappoint them. A growing number of young people got the chance to speak in Yizhi\u2019s board of directors and high-end studio. This allowed them to design the whole show to be more innovative.</p><br/><p>The last high-end Yizhi show attracted global attention with the pure Huaxia ancient customs and won a lot of praise. This time, Yizhi\u2019s main style was steampunk and the theme was directly called \u2018Patchwork Aesthetics.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were fresh steampunk-like elements in each of the high-end male clothing. It might be the trajectory of a mechanical gear\u2019s rotation that could be seen in a formal tuxedo or the handmade embroidery threat that was as silver as lightning on the beautifully elegant suit.</p><br/><p>If other high-end shows were to attract everyone with absolutely pure fashion aesthetics, then Yizhi was gradually exploring another way in order to achieve their own progress and transformation.</p><br/><p>Rosalind\u2019s chief designer Raymond\u2019s evaluation about this ingenious high-end show was, \u201cIt isn\u2019t that easy to change. The design level and creativity of Yizhi is already among the top luxury brands. But once they go the wrong way, they are likely to fall into a hopeless situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi, the chief designer of Ji and Ya who also attended the show, gave a different opinion from Raymond. \u201cThere must be some innovation and someone has to change. It is good to have ideas but they haven\u2019t done what they wanted to achieve.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he said this, a reporter told Xi Ze that Raymond believed Yizhi was still changed, but it was possible for them to not recover.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised his eyebrows with interest before smiling. \u201cIn this fashion show, can you clearly remember the clothes that a supermodel was wearing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was surprised by these questions and then smiled guiltily. These steampunk style outfits were too novel so he couldn\u2019t specifically remember an outfit at the moment. But if he must say something\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI clearly remember the three outfits worn by the finale model Ming Yu. I remember that Ming Yu\u2019s first outfit had a jagged pattern on the left shoulder. The second outfit seemed normal, there was just a bit of unevenness with the hem. In the case of the third outfit, he seemed to be wearing an ordinary outfit but he had a fully transparent pocket watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter became excited as he found that he could clearly remember the outfits Ming Yu wore so clearly, despite it being half an hour after the show ended. He could still recall how stunned he felt at that time.</p><br/><p>However, Xi Ze\u2019s lips curved and he replied with a simple sentence. \u201cYou are remembering Ming Yu, not the fashion show.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was momentarily stunned and couldn\u2019t regain his composure for a long time.</p><br/><p>The next day, many media outlets reported about the Yizhi fashion show. Most newspapers published Raymond\u2019s point of view, saying that Yizhi made an interesting attempt. It would be a big breakthrough if it succeeded but it would be for naught if it failed.</p><br/><p>This description was very good and didn\u2019t provoke any quarrels. Many media outlets chose Raymond\u2019s point of view as a starting point to describe some of the recent changes in Yizhi and its fashion show.</p><br/><p>It was only Huaxia Times Entertainment Daily that wrote a complete article on Xi Ze\u2019s statement. These words set off a wave of turmoil in the fashion world. This wave wasn\u2019t painful for Xi Ze but it made some people worry about Yizhi\u2019s future.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s meaning was: Yizhi has the ambition but not the strength.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s words also poured cold water on the heads of the young people in Yizhi who were eager to try new things. At that evening\u2019s meeting, they studied the hundreds of outfits in this high-end show and started sweating as they understood.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s words weren\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>After that, Yizhi took it slowly in order to achieve a higher breakthrough. However, this was another story and let\u2019s not talk about it for the time being.</p><br/><p>On the eve of April 2018, the first high-end fashion week came to an end.</p><br/><p>During this period, in addition to being invited as Yizhi\u2019s finale model, Ming Yu also took part in the Rosalind, Garcia, Peters, Miyajima Biliu and other luxury brand fashion shows.</p><br/><p>More than 10 of the world\u2019s top luxury brands threw an olive branch to Ming Yu if they were holding a men\u2019s fashion show, inviting him to be the opening/finale model. Unless the timing conflicted, the fashion industry\u2019s labour model Ming Xiaoyu participated in every show and won global acclaim.</p><br/><p>Of course, this Ji and Ya high-end show was a female show. It was worth mentioning that this time, Ji and Ya invited the top five female supermodels in the world to come together on the same stage.</p><br/><p>Among them was the transgender Adenes who was dazzling as she walked the stage with her long hair. She really was worthy of the title of \u2018most beautiful model in the world in 50 years.\u2019</p><br/><p>For the finale, Adenes wore a white and dignified wedding dress, walking the runway to the applause of the audience. Xi Ze appeared after her as the chief designer to thank the audience. The former top two male supermodels of the world stood together, making it inevitable for many reporters to twist the news.</p><br/><p>The next day, the photo of Xi Ze standing next to Adenes in the wedding dress swept through the world.</p><br/><p>Many fans said: My God Xi already has Ming Xiaoyu. There is no need for someone else!</p><br/><p>However, some unscrupulous small media outlets wanted to grab attention and put Xi Ze and Adenes\u2019 names together. They even suggested that there might be an abnormal relationship between the two of them. You see, look how well matched the two of them are together! Maybe Adenes changed sex due to Xi Ze!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze who saw these news, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu who saw these news, \u201c\u2026^\uff3f^####\u201d</p><br/><p>The next second, a certain man firmly raised his hand and vowed, \u201cAdenes hates me very much and doesn\u2019t even want to look at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was deeply immersed in the vinegar jar and couldn\u2019t extricate himself no matter how trivial the matter. In any case, he was jealous. Jealousy wasn\u2019t rational so he must be angry! If he wasn\u2019t jealous then he really was too generous!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you say she hates you? I saw you having a good laugh with her at the high-end show and you even held Adenes hand! If she really hates you, how come I have never heard about it before? Did you hear her personally say that she hates you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Five minutes later, Adenes posted a message on Twitter.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Who the hell said that I changed sex because of @Xi Ze? I really hate him! Even if I am transgender, it is for my own dream! Who told you that I must like men after changing sexes? I love women!!! @He Chaoman, yesterday you were really beautiful in the high-end show\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>The fashion enthusiasts around the world, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu who saw this tweet, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze who saw this tweet, \u201c\u2026You wronged me. I am very unhappy and want compensation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Here I will omit 10,000 words of God Xi throwing down Small Mushroom.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman who was playing games at home, \u201cAchoo! Who is cursing me?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The comics, fan edited videos and stories were endless. Despite Luo Ru\u2019s words, Ming Xiaoyu clicked on his fan forum to see what the fans were writing about his relationship with Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu only opened a few posts and was still quite happy.</p><br/><p>There were many people with literary talents in the pink fan circle. Ming Yu sometimes laughed as he looked at these stories. It was because in these fan writings, Xi Ze was completely devoid of his poisonous tongue.</p><br/><p>People regarded Xi Ze as the warm man who became hotter recently. He was \u2018cold on the outside, warm on the inside\u2019, \u2018there is a hot heart hidden under the icy appearance\u2019, \u2018he looks cold but he often rescues small animals\u2019, etc\u2026</p><br/><p>A hot heart\u2026</p><br/><p>Rescues small animals\u2026</p><br/><p>Do you know what Xi Ze was most afraid of? It was fluffy creatures!!</p><br/><p>However, most of these stories were the so-called sweet and meng stories. There wasn\u2019t the BE abuse type text that was often seen with CPs. After all, the two people had already confirmed a love relationship. This was a big candy for every fan. How was it possible to sprinkle dog blood?</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu watched for a while before feeling tired. He intended to formally leave this section. He was just about to leave when he suddenly saw a post.</p><br/><p>[Hehehe, a new wave of hehehe is here~ Come on~]</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was slightly stunned before opening the post. He followed the address left by the LZ and downloaded the \u2018hehehe\u2019 file. Zhao Rui just opened to push open the door the moment Ming Xiaoyu opened the \u2018txt\u2019 file.</p><br/><p>There was a flash of lightning.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui said, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s premier, you remember\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u2211\uff08\u3063 \u00b0\u0414 \u00b0\uff1b\uff09\u3063!!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a <i>bang </i>and Ming Yu hurriedly closed his computer. Zhao Rui looked at Ming Yu with a strange expression. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cXiaoyu, what are you looking at? Why is the screen full of \u2018ah\u2019, \u2018,\u2019 and ellipsis?\u201d</p><br/><p>The beautiful youth\u2019s ears reddened. He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cBrother Zhao, you didn\u2019t see anything. Continue to speak. There is something I need to pay attention to at tomorrow\u2019s premier?\u201d</p><br/><p>The confused Zhao Rui touched his head. His IQ and emotional intelligence meant he didn\u2019t think too much. He just continued to talk with Ming Yu about matters related to tomorrow\u2019s job.</p><br/><p>The stupid and pure Zhao Rui didn\u2019t know what the essence of the language he just saw was.</p><br/><p>It was a burst of sweet and seductive moaning ah\uff5e\uff01</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how to appreciate the essence of \u2018ah\u2019, \u2018,\u2019 and ellipsis! And he didn\u2019t see the words that plugged up the mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh, this was the fun\uff5e you don\u2019t understand it\uff5e</p><br/><p>Well, an old virgin certainly wouldn\u2019t understand. Zhao Rui, \u201c\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>By the way, Xi Ze was busy with the Ji and Ya high-end show that would take place in February. Therefore, he didn\u2019t come to Muse and was busy at his high-end studio. But busy was busy. He still had a bit of free time to go online and checked the news about himself and Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>The exposure of Xi Ze and Ming Yu\u2019s relationship last month, the entire Huaxia and global entertainment industries received a sensational earthquake. The aftermath spread for half a month and hadn\u2019t dissipated so far. People around the world and on the Internet kept talking about it.</p><br/><p>Many people were talking about when Xi Ze and Ming Yu got together. There was also the media who ridiculed that the relationship between the two men wouldn\u2019t last long. Even the marriages between male and female stars would have one or two cheating, or one or two divorces. Not to mention the fact that two men couldn\u2019t have children together.</p><br/><p>Once he saw these remarks, Xi Ze\u2019s face remained blank. Then he called Ding Bo to deal with the unscrupulous media who were harmful for the industry.</p><br/><p>What was the reason?</p><br/><p>Reporting false news, wasn\u2019t this good enough? It was simply leading people astray!</p><br/><p>After taking care of the small media who dared to make up lies, Xi Ze opened his side account and started to show off his wealth. This time, God Z wasn\u2019t so dazzling. He only bought 1,000 copies\u2014 Yes, compared with the previous 5,000 and 10,000 copies, this was \u2018only\u2019 1,000.</p><br/><p>\u3010 What? God Z is buying less magazines than before? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 There is only 1,000! It took me 10 minutes compared to the piles in the past! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ah, if I have God Z\u2019s financial resources, I would definitely buy a mountain of Ming Xiaoyu magazines! I will lick the full 360 degrees of every cover, without missing any corner. I want to let the whole world know that this magazine was contracted by me! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 23333 The sister above, I give you the title: Master of Magazines! Abbreviated to Mixed Master! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Every time God Z supported Ming Xiaoyu, he would take a variety of photos and expose the areas he brought. This time he only bought 1,000 copies but it caused quite a stir among the pink fan circle, meaning it was quickly noticed by someone.</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: Buying so much! [/Knife]// @Zyu: The new issue of Si Chen [/Photo] \u3011</p><br/><p>Originally, \u2018I want to break my wife\u2019s leg\u2019 forward was mixed among thousands of other fans, making it not very eye-catching. After all, God Z was a mushroom fan leader with more than tens of thousands of fans. There was no way to compare with Xiao Xiao Yu Yu, but the number of forwards for his Weibo posts was very scary.</p><br/><p>This time, some people accidentally discovered it and put it on the home page of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s Muse fan forum.</p><br/><p>[God Z shouted many times and this good legs sister didn\u2019t pay attention. Finally there is a miracle XDD]</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fan forum mostly published information about Ming Yu but it was also a chat area for fans. This miracle was actually an allusion. They all knew that since the end of last month, God Z had been posted on the Good Legs sister\u2019s Weibo. However, the Good Legs sister was so cold and didn\u2019t reply to God Z.</p><br/><p>Many mushroom fans said: \u3010 Good Legs Sister actually replied to God Z, we are witnessing a miracle! \u3011</p><br/><p>Why did people think that Good Legs was a sister? Of course, it was because the Good Legs Weibo account wrote that she was a woman. At the same time, how could God Z act like this every day if she wasn\u2019t a soft and cute girl?</p><br/><p>Unless God Z was gay like God Xi and Mushroom \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>But how could there be so many gay people in the world? Don\u2019t think too much. Good Legs must be a soft sister!</p><br/><p>This time, Good Legs forwarded God Z\u2019s Weibo and many fans started to pay attention to their movements. God Z soon replied within five minutes.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu\uff1aI bought very little. I have been very good. [/Pitiful] // @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: Buying\u2026 \u3011 After another five minutes.</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: This is being very good? [/Knife] // @Zyu: I bought very\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>Three minutes later.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: I want to support Ming Yu, don\u2019t deprive me of this hobby [/Kiss] \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: You are shameless. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu\uff1aI\u2019m not shameless. Aren\u2019t I good? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Many onlooker fans: \u2026Dammit!! Showing love in broad daylight! Do they have any moral integrity? Don\u2019t do this during the day! This wasn\u2019t showing love. It was showing love that made people angry!!</p><br/><p>Originally, fans wanted to see God Z\u2019s bought items. They didn\u2019t think they would see dog food! This was also luxury dog food! There was no energy when it suddenly came again!</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: Do you want me? Oh, I don\u2019t want you. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: I handed in my salary card. I will give you food and warm the bed for you. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: Saying this in public. God Z, aren\u2019t you afraid of being scolded by your fans? Your image! Pay attention to your image! \u3011</p><br/><p>The moment the Good Legs Sister spoke, the hundreds of thousands of God Z\u2019s fans immediately responded.</p><br/><p>\u3010 That\u2019s right! My dog\u2019s eyes are blind! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I became God Z\u2019s fan because I like his noble and flamboyant self! I found that God Z is very cold. He always shows off and never replies to us. He also doesn\u2019t bother to argue about other issues. He just shows his surroundings, it is so cool! But today\u2026 God Z! You aren\u2019t my beloved God Z!! QAQ \u3011 Many fans talked about the Good Legs sister but they didn\u2019t know the meaning behind Ming Yu\u2019s words. He was saying: God Z, openly publishing such unspeakable remarks on the Internet. Aren\u2019t you afraid of your millions of Weibo fans turning black if you are discovered?</p><br/><p>In response, God Z response could be called: Foolish! In! Love!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: As long as I have you, what do other people matter? My heart is very small. I can only contain you alone. When I see your beautiful slender and long legs, I bow before your jeans. I surrender and become a love slave. Do you remember our first encounter? You were so righteous, scolding me privately about my shameful behaviour. This overbearing president fell in love with you at first sight. It is unforgettable. Good, be my lover @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg.\u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

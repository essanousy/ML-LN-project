However, this was enough to make the cancer of the fashion industry unable to have a comeback.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Cheng Su was at the police station and certain of the originator of the evil. In his heart, he had long recognized that only Xi Ze could make him fall to such an unbearable situation, making him lose so quickly and now having to coexist with fierce criminals.</p><br/><p>However, this time Cheng Su really wronged Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze did only one thing from the beginning, which was to let the head of Muse\u2019s legal department take this case.</p><br/><p>The other matters, from contacting the marketing companies or directing public opinion with the media, were all the result of a small and witty Mushroom\u2019s cooperation with the Muse PR department.</p><br/><p>Muse\u2019s PR department had never been involved in a struggle between their own models, but principles were involved in this battle.</p><br/><p>On the day that Xi Ze and Ming Yu announced their relationship, Shen Xiang had already figured out who broke the news behind the scenes. Yes, it was Cheng Su and his assistant Xiao An.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze and Ming Yu were top models with the highest level of attention in the company. Cheng Su\u2019s behavior seriously threatened the interests of the company. Now that it reached this extent, who cared if he was a Muse model?</p><br/><p>He already crossed the line so don\u2019t blame the company for being ruthless!</p><br/><p>The general direction was agreed upon by Ming Yu and Shen Xiang, with the specific steps being implemented by Muse\u2019s PR department. In the end, the police really found a bottle of drugs in Cheng Su\u2019s home. Shen Xiang was really surprised and couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>Only Ming Xiaoyu sighed heavily, not uttering a single word.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s words in the police station weren\u2019t false. He wasn\u2019t the one who took drugs, it was Ming Yu. No, to be precise, it was the previous Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>A 14 year old child was easily controlled. In the beginning, Cheng Su used Ming Yu and was able to control him well. However, the original Ming Yu became older and his contact with the industry increased, causing his mind to gradually mature.</p><br/><p>The original was very dissatisfied that Cheng Su never kissed him. They only held hands or hugged.</p><br/><p>Most people had a rebellious period. During this period, the original Ming Yu\u2019s temper was quite violent and he didn\u2019t pay much attention to Cheng Su\u2019s words. At this time, Cheng Su had already opened the door and was about to become a first-tier model.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was disgusted at having such a time bomb around him. He looked down on the original as a disgusting homosexual and wondered how to continue manipulating the original.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was thinking about this when a friend in the industry brought him a hallucinogen.</p><br/><p>The friend said that the addiction of the hallucinogen wasn\u2019t very high but the effect was very good. If any woman wasn\u2019t obedient, he just needed to pour a little bit in her cup to ensure that the woman was intoxicated and unable to extricate herself. Then there was no problem doing what he wanted with her.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su took this drug but it wasn\u2019t to use on a woman. In Cheng Su\u2019s eyes, any woman would definitely like him. Why would he need such a thing? Now that this happened, he could let the original Ming Yu try it.</p><br/><p>The first time he tried it, the original body fainted.</p><br/><p>After that, Cheng Su used this powder to hold onto the original, making the original obediently listen to him for a few months. Later, Zhao Rui didn\u2019t know it but the original secretly told Cheng Su about a resource and the requirements to get it. Then Cheng Su gave the hallucinogen to the original a second time.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su hadn\u2019t expected that the original Ming Yu really liked him. The last time, he experienced such a wonderful feeling. Therefore, the original resisted the desires of his heart and decided to wait for Cheng Su to come back so they could try this powder together.</p><br/><p>That night, Cheng Su finished shooting the cover of a first-tier magazine and returned home, only to see the original owner.</p><br/><p>The child\u2019s temper had reared up again and Cheng Su saw that the original Ming Yu didn\u2019t have any more value to him. Therefore, Cheng Su exposed his ugly face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yu, you are so disgusting! Don\u2019t touch my hand. Every time I hold hands with you, I feel sick enough to vomit! Do you really think that I didn\u2019t kiss you because you are too young? Oh, I am disgusted with you! You are a disgusting homosexual, you shouldn\u2019t exist in this world!!\u201d</p><br/><p>That night, Cheng Su took his house keys from the original Ming Yu and rushed the child out.</p><br/><p>For six months, the original had been in a rebellious period. Now he was ruthlessly humiliated and abandoned. This made him have many extreme thoughts and his temperament became more violent. In the end, he chose such a painful ending.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu had some compassion for the original, but not that much. There was only one life and this was the original\u2019s choice. He chose to end his precious life because of a scum and this was his ending.</p><br/><p>However, Ming Yu was completely disgusted with Cheng Su!</p><br/><p>On the surface, the original owner was suicidal but he was also forced to death by this disgusting scum!</p><br/><p>When Ming Xiaoyu had received the original body\u2019s memories, he learned that the original had hidden the hallucinogen in Cheng Su\u2019s wardrobe, only wanting to give a surprise to the person he liked and to share this with him.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s disgust went deep into his bones.</p><br/><p>If the original\u2019s suicide was wrong, it was still his own choice. However, Cheng Su was really disgusting for leading the original owner to this end.</p><br/><p>There was a saying about Cheng Su. It was precisely because there was such a small person who wanted to step on a bigger person that the industry became so murky!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think about how to improve his strength. Instead, he was thinking about how to suppress and steal from others. This person was doomed to not last long in the industry and to receive retribution.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t know that Xi Ze sent a top lawyer to \u2018help\u2019 Cheng Su. But he was ready. Once Cheng Su left the prison, he would let Cheng Su have a miserable time for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>In fact, for the next eight years, Cheng Su never stepped out of prison.</p><br/><p>A bunch of bystanders didn\u2019t think that all types of charges were pressed on Cheng Su\u2019s body. Some netizens even felt that the eight year prison sentence was too heavy. However, he wasn\u2019t a good person so everyone was too lazy to say something good about him.</p><br/><p>In the eight years, Cheng Su discovered that the prison that looked so well-ordered on the outside unexpectedly had so many dirty and terrible things\u2026</p><br/><p>A handsome supermodel was put into prison. The result that would happen, I\u2019m afraid that anyone could think of it.</p><br/><p>Eight years later, Cheng Su was extremely skinny when he left prison. The only handsome face had now become gaunt. He walked on the street and when he touched a man\u2019s body, he trembled with horror. He even shrank into a ball and was afraid to get up.</p><br/><p>Disgusting homosexuals, disgusting homosexuals.</p><br/><p>In the end, Cheng Su was the scum who insulted homosexuality but he really had the prison memories.</p><br/><p>After Cheng Su was arrested by the police for drug matters, he truly disappeared from the public\u2019s field of view. No one had any goodwill towards him. Many people thought that this was the end of the matter, only for a netizen who didn\u2019t want to be named to release explosive materials about Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>The person who framed Ming Yu and released those photos was Cheng Su!</p><br/><p>This matter made Cheng Su\u2019s reputation even worse. It was so smelly that waves couldn\u2019t wash it clean.</p><br/><p>The netizens scolded Cheng Su until he had no chance of turning over, while Muse officially dismissed a small assistant.</p><br/><p>As Cheng Su\u2019s assistant Xiao An was leaving the company, Zhao Rui happily walked past him and said, \u201cHelping that tyrant, did you think there would be a good end for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence caused Xiao An to shake with fright and he directly betrayed Cheng Su, explaining everything he did including keeping an eye on Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu naturally didn\u2019t care about Xiao An\u2019s behaviour while Zhao Rui and Luo Ru just sneered.</p><br/><p>As for the assistant Xiao An, it wasn\u2019t possible for him to work in any company in the industry anymore. It was because the modelling and entertainment companies all knew that Xiao An used to be Cheng Su\u2019s assistant. The actions that a model did, how could his assistant not know? He didn\u2019t get involved?</p><br/><p>No one would believe that!</p><br/><p>Assistant Xiao An\u2019s bleak ending was easily imagined.</p><br/><p>In any case, these events ended. After settling Cheng Su, Zhao Rui regained his spirit and asked with horror, \u201cXiaoyu, since when have you and Xi Ze been together? I didn\u2019t know anything about it! He is really\u2026 you are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we really are together.\u201d The youth smiled and said, \u201cBrother Zhao, you can rest assured that we have a normal relationship and no other interests.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu said this but Zhao Rui still felt a bit strange. He muttered with some hesitation, \u201cI used to listen to A\u2019Wei. Xi Ze\u2019s background isn\u2019t very simple. For him to suddenly open up about a relationship, it doesn\u2019t feel realistic\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu knew that Zhao Rui was naturally worried for him. Therefore, he changed the topic. \u201cBrother Zhao, why are you saying this to me? You have known Sister Wei for so long, how can there still be no news?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was scared. \u201cA\u2019Wei? What news would I have with A\u2019Wei?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Ming Yu didn\u2019t get the chance to speak. Luo Ru spoke up in agreement with him. \u201cOf course, it is news regarding that matter. Brother Zhao, Sister Wei is 20 this you. If you don\u2019t take the initiative, be careful that Sister Wei doesn\u2019t turn her attention elsewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s face turned green when he heard this and he said with a frightened face, \u201cA\u2019Wei is my sister! What news can I have with her?!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru, \u201c\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u03a3\uff08\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, the misunderstanding that lasted for 700,000 words had been completely clarified.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was the second highest level in the building, just below the 58th floor set aside for the board of directors.</p><br/><p>The huge studio occupied the entire floor. The style was simple, a black and white modern style. The large area used a variety of glass materials to turn the whole room into a unique and transparent world. Once Ming Yu stepped on the transparent glass floor, he could see the clear water flowing underneath and it had a strange beauty.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu filled with hatred, \u201c?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu would pay off his mortgage next month but he still lacked a car. He was wondering what type of car to buy because he had to decide which one was cost effective while maintaining face. Don\u2019t think that Small Mushroom was a pure-hearted mushroom. He was a public figure now and had to pay attention to his image!</p><br/><p>In fact, MIng Yu\u2019s current value based on his various endorsements and paychecks combined was enough for him to buy an extremely expensive luxury car. But as a model who often attended various shows and evening parties, Ming Xiaoyu had to save money in case he needed to buy high-end clothing.</p><br/><p>Many people liked to borrow high-end clothing to attend parties but Ming Yu didn\u2019t like it.</p><br/><p>Once he really chose an outfit, he would buy it. It was because as long as he was willing to wear it to attend a party, it must be an outfit that he really liked. This was probably a collection addiction \u2190 if he had a favourite outfit then he wanted to buy it.</p><br/><p>But this collection addiction was really too extravagant!</p><br/><p>The poor Small Mushroom hadn\u2019t yet paid off his mortgage or bought a car \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d Ming Xiaoyu was filled with resentment and he said angrily, \u201cIn view of your wasteful spending, I have decided to add a third house rule. In the future, the financial power of the family will be controlled be me. Every time you withdraw more than 100,000, you must declare it!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Cough.</i></p><br/><p>At these words, Xi Ze unexpectedly staggered and almost fell!</p><br/><p>This reaction almost made Ming Xiaoyu shocked. His words were half-joking. How could XI Ze be so \u2018scared\u2019 that he almost fell? Was this normal? Was there something in Ming Yu\u2019s words that shouldn\u2019t be said?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked at Ming Yu with a strange expression and asked hesitated, \u201cAm I a wasteful spender?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu answered without hesitation. \u201cOf course!\u201d Look at your studio. Isn\u2019t the window electronically controlled? Doesn\u2019t this glass floor also cost a lot of money? Real water is actually introduced! And the painting on the wall\u2026 oh my! Isn\u2019t this painting a Van Gogh? Do you dare say that you aren\u2019t a wasteful spender?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu finally couldn\u2019t bear it when he saw the painting by Van Gogh.</p><br/><p>This painting wasn\u2019t as famous as Van Gogh\u2019s The Starry Night or Sunflower. However, even the art ignorant Ming Yu recognized it. It must be a famous work of Van Gogh and would go for tens of millions at auction. Billions might be possible!</p><br/><p>After listening to Ming Yu\u2019s explanation, Xi Ze sighed with relief. He grabbed the youth\u2019s waist and said innocently, \u201cYou have really wronged me. This painting is from Teacher\u2019s collection and has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze had two teachers. When he was young, he was inspired by the Italian design master Hornby. Once this teacher died, Ms. Ji Heya took him as a student and asked him to serve as Ji and Ya\u2019s assistant designer until she died.</p><br/><p>After listening to this explanation, Ming Xiaoyu asked suspiciously, \u201cIs it really that simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man put his other hand on the youth\u2019s waist. With his taller height, he bent his head slightly to look at the youth in front of him with a gentle and tolerant gaze. His tone was solemn as he said, \u201cYes, it is really so simple. Home Master, your eyes are so good. You can see the most expensive thing in this room at a glance. The other things added up aren\u2019t as expensive as this painting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Ming Xiaoyu felt that things weren\u2019t so simple, he looked at Xi Ze\u2019s face and found that this person wasn\u2019t lying. Since it was just a fraction of the painting\u2019s price, it wasn\u2019t particularly wasteful spending.</p><br/><p>Well, Ming Yu would let it go this time.</p><br/><p>A famous painting worth 98.6 million, a value of 8.6 million was really just a fraction of it.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze and Ming Xiaoyu spent the afternoon in the studio. In the beginning, Xi Ze chose Ming Yu as a model and designed an outfit for him. After that, the drawing task became more and more vivid.</p><br/><p>The painter said that if the jacket was taken off, the body\u2019s lines would be better revealed and he could design the fitted curves. The painter said that if the T-shirt was also taken off, it would show the beautiful clavicle and design a personally fitted outfit.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu would be stupid if he really took his clothes off!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sneered at this blatant act of bullying and directly put on his coat. He ignored the other person to go to the table, reprimanding the man. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with my eyes. Mr. Xi, your nasty mind can\u2019t escape my\u2026eyes\u2026! What is this?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He saw that on the table, a half-naked upper body was vividly drawn on the paper!</p><br/><p>The smooth curves of the waist, the raised clavicle line, each pen sketch was just right! Every curve of the line was filled with an ambiguous colour! Don\u2019t mention the other people who would see this drawing. Ming Xiaoyu was so shocked that his mouth fell open!</p><br/><p>What was this expression?</p><br/><p>What exactly was this facial expression?!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu knew his own expression the most! He had clearly only been smiling normally. Why did he become so beautiful\u2026 cough, so uncomfortable under the man\u2019s pen!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s expression changed as he said, \u201cWhat the hell are you drawing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am drawing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, he continued, \u201cThis isn\u2019t me at all! I am wearing clothes! I didn\u2019t look at you with this expression. I was obviously sitting opposite you. How can you draw it like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The handsome and graceful man sighed before saying meaningfully, \u201cI am drawing you from last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was silly enough to love a designer?</p><br/><p>In the latter half of the afternoon, Mr. Xi\u2019s wish for office play didn\u2019t come true but he managed to achieve his lover\u2019s kiss. By the time the two people packed up and left the studio, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s cheeks were slightly red and a few red dots on his chest were covered by his clothes.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu asked casually, \u201cBy the way, who called you today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t think too much of it as he replied, \u201cLuo Cheng had a bit of trouble in the United States. Rosalind asked him to shoot a semi-nude poster that only used leaves to cover the key parts. The photographer was a woman and he was a bit shy. Therefore, he looked for Wenya, Wenya looked for Dingbo and Dingbo came to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu heard this and nodded. \u201cIt turned out to involve Luo Cheng and Rosalind\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, the youth\u2019s eyes suddenly widened and he looked at the man next to him. \u201cWait! No wonder I didn\u2019t feel it was right before! Weren\u2019t you meeting with Elder Chen before when you received the call today? It was clear that Alice was taking me around. How did Elder Chen suddenly appear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu asked a few questions before becoming enlightened. \u201cYes! How can there be such a coincidence? You told Elder Chen to tell me those things! Honestly confess. Didn\u2019t you have Elder Chen tell me those things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised his eyebrows with surprise and asked in a puzzled tone, \u201cEh? Did Uncle Chen tell you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>If this had been when Ming Xiaoyu first entered a relationship with this man, he might\u2019ve been deceived by the acting. Now both of them were an old husband and wife for a long time. Ming Xiaoyu clearly knew how black this man was.</p><br/><p>He sneered and said, \u201cIf you honestly admit it, tonight I will allow you to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I let Elder Chen go to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze spoke very seriously. \u201cCome on, you have to catch a plane tomorrow morning. One half-hour of a night in spring is worth a thousand taels.\u201d (TL: Basically, every minute is important)</p><br/><p>Xi Ze pulled his wrist towards the car and Ming Xiaoyu spoke indignantly. \u201cYou are simply too bad! When Elder Chen said those things, my heart was distressed. I was also thinking about how to comfort you today. How can you lie to me like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was so stunned that he forgot his seat belt. Therefore, before driving, Xi Ze leaned over to help him fasten the seat belt.</p><br/><p>A long strand of hair gently fell over his forehead. His eyes were serious, as if he was looking at the world\u2019s most precious treasure. Every movement was careful and thoughtful.</p><br/><p>In front of such a devoted gaze, the anger in Ming Yu dissipated.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze slightly turned to press a light kiss against the young man\u2019s lips. Then he smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you. These things did happen and I chose to let you know about it. I wanted you to understand that I\u2019m not an omnipotent person. You should know more about me, understanding my life and my whole self. Perhaps some selfless people might think that as long as their lover is happy, it is fine. But Ming Yu, I am a selfish person. I like your distressed expression when you feel bad for me and I also like when you cry. Of course, you are only allowed to cry in bed.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

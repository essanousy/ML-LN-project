He would make Ming Yu apologize every time he saw Andrew!</p><br/><p>And what about Ming Yu? Facing Andrew, who was backed by Karma, he could only try to maintain his dignity again and again. Despite his voice trembling, he still asked for the other party to apologize!</p><br/><p>When Andrew bullied Ming Yu like that, Ming Yu could only endure it. But once Andrew insulted his homeland, Ming Yu no longer tolerated it. He stood up directly, even if he risked offending the man who could drive him out of the European and American fashion industries. He wouldn\u2019t allow Andrew to insult his homeland!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Damn Andersu, do you have eyes? Is your name on the rankings? No! Look at the 42nd place! Who is it? Who is it?!!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I have never seen a man as brazen as Ander! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Look at this person, he became a supermodel because he debuted with Karma. This man dares say that Ming Xiaoyu won\u2019t appear on the rankings? He dares to scold our Ming Xiaoyu? He dares to bully our Ming Xiaoyu? Ander must come out and apologize! He must pay the price!!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 QAQ Small Mushroom\u2019s voice might be processed and the original voice can\u2019t be heard, but I am still sad\u2026 Mushroom\u2019s voice is trembling. How can Andrew bully Mushroom? He is disgusting! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>As early as the day before, many netizens spontaneously started to boycott any brand related to Andrew in Huaxia. The next day, the hundreds of Karma counters in Huaxia faced an unprecedented cold storm!</p><br/><p>There were some people who didn\u2019t know what happened and came to the Karma counter as usual. Then they were discouraged by passing customers. Thus, there was no one at all the Karma counters in Huaxia!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because the recent sales of high-end shopping malls wasn\u2019t good. Besides the Karma counter, the other luxury brands still has hot sales, forming a sharp contrast with the dismal Karma counters.</p><br/><p>\u201cKarma\u2019s main men\u2019s clothing line Roth Matt, for the first time the sales volume in Huaxia is only five digits!</p><br/><p>Karma\u2019s main beauty skin care line Lilanka, for the first time the sales volume in Huaxia is only four digits!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Huaxia had a quarter of the world\u2019s population and also the highest national GDP in the world! Huaxia\u2019s people were quite generous and keen to pursue a better life. They weren\u2019t stingy when it came to consumption. Therefore, this country was always a must for global luxury brands, even if they needed to pay high taxes.</p><br/><p>Today, Karma was met with the Antarctic treatment!</p><br/><p>To the people of Huaxia, it completely didn\u2019t exist! When customers walked past the Karma counter, they used their eyes and words to vent their hatred towards this brand.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t doubt why Andrew could make Huaxia people hate Karma so much.</p><br/><p>You know, Huaxia had a strength that was unmatched by the rest of the word. Those were were racist were afraid to say anti-Huaxia rhetoric. It was because the cohesion of the people in Huaxia couldn\u2019t be imagined. As long as you dared insult their country, then just wait for a lesson in blood.</p><br/><p>For example, 10 years ago, there was an anti-Huaxia writer who said on a local program in Italy, \u201cI really don\u2019t like the country of Huaxia. They are a group of dangerous people. They are economically developed and their military is also quite terrible. If they continue to develop like this, they will become the masters of the whole world!\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a strictly anti-Huaxia speech.</p><br/><p>They even praised Huaxia\u2019s powerful national strength.</p><br/><p>But for the 1.3 billion Huaxia people who listened, it was blown up in a flash!</p><br/><p>They were a group of rabbits guarding their own carrots. They just wanted to guard themselves. This gentleman was jealous of their national strength and economic prosperity. That\u2019s why he advocated the \u2018Huaxia is dangerous\u2019 theory. What was this? Was it because he wanted to sell books in Huaxia that he was afraid to directly say anti-Huaxia words?</p><br/><p>Even if he was writing a gold book, they would never read it!</p><br/><p>The writer never imagined that the words he said on a small program would result in such a large boycott. The previous week, his book had tens of thousands of sales in Huaxia. The next week, his book only had a few hundred sales!</p><br/><p>Those were roundabout words. Then what did Andrew say?</p><br/><p>Their blood was disgusting!</p><br/><p>Their skin was disgusting!</p><br/><p>Since he despised them, don\u2019t blame them for not seeing him!</p><br/><p>Within three days, the stocks price of Karma plummeted! Many Huaxia groups working with Karma decided to end their cooperation period. One, Karma\u2019s reputation had become unspeakable in Huaxia. Two, they really disliked cooperating with an anti-Huaxia brand!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Karma counters around the country started to close.</p><br/><p>Bad sales was one thing, but it was impossible for the counters to close in three days because of this! In fact, many Karma sisters submitted their resignations or requested a change in counters.</p><br/><p>They also hated Karma and were tired of standing at the Karma counter, facing all those disgusted expressions.</p><br/><p>Within a week, Karma was already yelled at by everyone in Huaxia and this was after Karma ceased cooperation with Andrew. The pressure was unbearable. Even if Lisa Wallen wanted to protect her son, Karma\u2019s board of directors were adamant in putting the tortoise Andrew on stage.</p><br/><p>Andrew\u2019s social networking sites had long become terrible. The Huaxia netizens were the most numerous but there were also netizens from Japan, Korea, Africa, the West, etc., who strongly condemned him.</p><br/><p>Andrew appeared and posted an apology video.</p><br/><p>In the video, he cried so much his eyes were red and he choked out all types of apologies. He said that he was just angry and didn\u2019t expect such serious consequences. He was only 17 years old and still young. His world view was still immature. Later, he would do his best to correct his worldview and he apologized to people around the world.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Haha? 17 years old is still young? This person became the prince of the European and American fashion industries when he was 17 years old! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Do you think this will be finished with an apology? Pushing the fault towards your age? You are 17, not 7 years old! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 You were angry? How dare you say that you were angry? Ming Yu was scolded to that extent and just asked you to apologize to Huaxia. What did you say? You have the nerve to say you were angry? Damn, go to hell! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 It is all a routine! Look, the first step is to cry. The second step is to apologize. The third step is for find excuses, such as being too young. The fourth step is saying they will change and the fifth step is to ask for forgiveness. Hey, why is this apology so familiar? Isn\u2019t it exactly the same as a male star a few years ago? \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If you offended a person, you must apologize so that the other party can accept. If you offend a group of people, you must sincerely apologize so that the other side can accept. But now! Andrew angered hundreds of millions of people around the world!</p><br/><p>It was a skill to agitate the yellow skinned and black skinned people in one sentence.</p><br/><p>Even now, Andrew didn\u2019t apologize to Ming Yu or those who had been oppressed by him in the European and American fashion industries.</p><br/><p>As early as this week, many small stars and models who had been bullied by Andrew appeared one after another, starting to accuse Andrew of suppressing and blocking them.</p><br/><p>A small model had a public confrontation with Andrew. From then on, he was hidden for the best years of his life. A little star just said that Andrew was very young and an \u2018uneducated little boy.\u2019 He was beaten up and banned from the United States!</p><br/><p>Do you think you could suppress people\u2019s angry voices? No! The people who had been bullied by Andrew buried hatred in their hearts for years. Now the the volcano finally erupted, it would be out of control!</p><br/><p>Those protesting Andrew gradually moved from \u2018protesting against Andrew\u2019s racist remarks\u2019 to \u2018protesting against Andrew\u2019s arrogance in Europe and the United States\u2019 and \u2018protesting against the chief designer of Karma who protected and condoned Andrew\u2019s misconduct.\u2019</p><br/><p>10 days later, Rosalind\u2019s chief designer entered Karma headquarters and talked with the Karma executives for more than an hour. The next day, Karma posted an announcement on their official website.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Due to the personal misconduct of Karma\u2019s chief designer Lisa Wallen, Karma has terminated the contract with Lisa Wallen. We have invited Longfellow Cuiqu as the new chief designer. Any Karma brand has no connect with Lisa Wallen. Karma\u2019s lawyers have also sent an official letter to Lisa Wallen, strongly requested compensation for damages to Karma\u2019s reputation\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>At this point, Karma really had nothing to do with the Wallen family.</p><br/><p>Even Andrew\u2019s father, who was on the Karma board of directors, was bought out by a mysterious Huaxia person. Karma thoroughly washed itself clean of the Wallen family.</p><br/><p>These things naturally caused a sensation in the global fashion industry.</p><br/><p>Lisa Wallen had been Karma\u2019s chief designer for 10 years. The chief designer of a top luxury brand rarely changed and now Lisa Wallen was actually dismissed by Karma? Then she really no longer had a path in the fashion industry!</p><br/><p>These fashion people simply thought that Lisa Wallen was killed by her bear son and that she was dismissed by the board of directors due to the Karma boycott.</p><br/><p>It was true that half the Karma counters in Huaxia were already removed and the situation was quite bleak in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and other places. It would be hard for Karma to fully recover without a decade or two.</p><br/><p>Although Karma had been dragged down by the Wallen family, the Karma board of directors had ignored the rampant arrogance of the Wallen family for years. This was punishment for them.</p><br/><p>Dismissing the chief designer was a tough choice for Karma but they had to do it. The first reason was because the new Huaxia major shareholder, who bought Mr. Wallen\u2019s shares when the stock price of Karma plummeted, strongly urged them to dismiss Mrs. Wallen. The second reason was because Rosalind put pressure on Karma, asking Karma to restore their reputation in the European and American fashion industries.</p><br/><p>Under various factors, the Wallen family was driven out of Karma and Andrew Wallen was a global enemy.</p><br/><p>This result caused great satisfaction and the anger of the people in the world (especially Huaxia) was somewhat relieved. Some people even ridiculed Andrew\u2019s video where his crying was just acting. They said he deserved to be this year\u2019s Golden Plum Award winner.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know that this would be the last time they saw Andrew Wallen.</p><br/><p>Since then, even the name Andrew Wallen didn\u2019t appear in any newspapers!</p><br/><p>His name didn\u2019t even go down because of his infamy?</p><br/><p>Sorry! You wanted people to know this name? After being scolded by the world for half a year, people were too lazy to comment on this shameless and nasty racist, so that no one remembered his name anymore.</p><br/><p>This promising new supermodel was really buried in history. Even if someone looked up his information, the only comment on his Wikipedia page was:</p><br/><p>\u300e Since the 21st century, the first person who dares to openly speak racist words. \u300f</p><br/>\n</div>"}

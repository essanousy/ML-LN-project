Apart from the itchiness in the throat, there were no other symptoms. But on this day, all the symptoms suppressed by the drugs erupted at once.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru wanted to send some soup to Ming Yu early in the morning. However, no one responded when she pressed the doorbell. Luo Ru felt like it was wrong and hurriedly pulled out her backup key to open the door. She entered through the door and quickly found Ming Xiaoyu in the bedroom.</p><br/><p>This was a really sick small mushroom!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s cheeks were a morbid pink, but his face was very pale, making the red colour more abnormal. His eyes were closed tightly as he occasionally coughed. Even in his dreams, he frowned uncomfortably and his eyelashes constantly shook as his eyes moved behind the eyelids.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru saw this and immediately understood. The cold had become a fever!</p><br/><p>She hurriedly grabbed a thermometer and measured his temperature. Luo Ru was surprised to find that Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s temperature wasn\u2019t as high as she had imagined. It was only 37.8 degrees Celsius, this could be regarded as a low-grade fever.</p><br/><p>After several of Luo Ru\u2019s actions, Ming Yu also woke up. He had a very hoarse throat and after learning his body temperature, he said softly, \u201cSister Luo, it is mainly a cough\u2026 My body is still okay and I don\u2019t need to go to the hospital. Can you buy me some fever stickers and paste it on?\u201d</p><br/><p>For any model (especially a famous model), it was very complicated to go to the hospital. It might be better to discuss things with the hospital, but some reporters would inevitably get wind of it and it would leak out, letting the whole world know that XXX was sick!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t want to announce his illness at this time. First, he didn\u2019t want to get tangled up in reporters. Secondly, it wasn\u2019t a very serious sickness. He just had a violent reaction today. It was estimated that was long as he made it past today, his condition would become much better.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru also understood Ming Yu\u2019s meaning. She thoughtfully bought a lot of medicine for Ming Yu, some fever stickers as well as rice, red beans, etc as she planned to cook porridge for Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>As everyone knew, Luo Ru was a very efficient and capable woman. This wasn\u2019t necessarily related to experience. She was just very suitable to be an agent and could do well. However, being an excellent agent didn\u2019t mean she was a good doctor!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t blame Luo Ru for having no insight. Can you say that you had used these fever stickers when you were young? Even the author (?) didn\u2019t use it!</p><br/><p>Thus, Luo Ru studied the fever stickers for a long time before finally pasting them. But it was crooked and she moved it two times before finally sticking it to Ming Yu\u2019s hot forehead.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Ming Yu was temporarily lethargic again at this time. If he was to see Luo Ru\u2019s clumsy appearance, he would surely be shocked and exclaim, \u201cSister Luo, you have never done this before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru silently helped Ming Yu pull up his quilt. She knew that with a fever, she shouldn\u2019t let him be cold and he should sweat it out. She had finished with the quilt and was planning to go to the kitchen. Suddenly, she heard Ming Yu\u2019s phone buzzing.</p><br/><p>The phone was flat on the bedside time. It was on silent, so only the buzzing sound was heard in the room. Luo Ru quickly picked up the phone in a decisive manner. She wanted to stop the noise and allow Ming Yu to have a good rest. However, Luo Ru was suddenly stunned when she saw the name flashing on the screen.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru didn\u2019t answer the phone, but after a moment, a call came again.</p><br/><p>It was another call failure and the other person actually called a third time!</p><br/><p>Luo Ru hesitated for a moment, before taking the phone into the living room. Ming Yu\u2019s phone had a password lock on it, making it impossible for Luo Ru to send a text message to the other party. Once the other person called a fourth time, she decisively answered the phone.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t allow the other person to speak as Luo Ru spoke respectfully in a low voice, \u201cMr. Xi, I\u2019m not Ming Yu. I am his assistant. Ming Yu is feeling a bit uncomfortable today. If you have anything to tell me, I will pass on the message to him when he wakes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze had only managed to say \u201cMing Yu,\u201d when he was interrupted by Luo Ru\u2019s words. He slightly raised an eyebrow and asked with thin lips, \u201cHe is feeling uncomfortable? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru wanted to keep it a secret. However, she recalled something that Ming Yu mentioned countless times. His relationship with Xi Ze was very good, it was the level of a friendship (not at all)!</p><br/><p>Luo Ru thought about it and honestly replied, \u201cMing Yu has a fever.\u201d</p><br/><p>20 minutes later, Xi Ze arrived at the apartment.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru had been feeling astonishment since Xi Ze said, \u201cI will be right there.\u201d Once she saw with her own eyes that Xi Ze really calm, she felt a strange calm.</p><br/><p>However, Luo Ru didn\u2019t think that as soon as Xi Ze entered, he would head straight for the bedroom!</p><br/><p>This was much faster than Luo Ru. It was as if he knew the structure of Ming Yu\u2019s house already and had been here countless times.</p><br/><p>How could these two people get along so well?</p><br/><p>A trace of doubt flashed in Luo Ru\u2019s heart. The sixth sense that belonged to a woman seemed to sense something, but she quickly forgot it.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru never thought that the phone call would attract Xi Ze, but also drive her out the door!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze sat by Ming Yu\u2019s bed and asked Luo Ru a few questions. Then Xi Ze whispered, \u201cI remember that you have a lot of work to do these days. Aren\u2019t you busy?\u201d There was a pause and Xi Ze added, \u201cDuring this period of Ming Yu\u2019s vacation, aren\u2019t you working with Zhao Rui on the Nidelan TV commercials?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru\u2019s eyes widened at the words and her heart shook.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze knowing their travel itinerary, this matter could still be explained. But Xi Ze knowing their schedule, it was very strange.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru admitted that even through she was the best in the latest batch of trainee agents, it was absolutely impossible for her to get Xi Ze\u2019s attention. If Zhao Rui knew Xi Ze, he wouldn\u2019t have been so unfortunate in the past few years. Then the only possibility was\u2026</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was paying attention to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>It seemed this fever sticker had been pasted quite badly. Xi Ze gently peeled off the white fever patch on the youth\u2019s forehead and replaced it with a new one. His movements were accurate and fast, especially compared to Luo Ru\u2019s crooked one. He was like a veteran in the medical field!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze stared at the boy on the bed as he asked, \u201cYou haven\u2019t taken care of a patient before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru was slightly startled when she realized he was talking to her and awkwardly nodded. \u201cI have rarely been sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should train in this. When you are free, look for Shen Xiang and he will contact the training department for you.\u201d Xei Ze carefully helped adjust the youth\u2019s quilt and said quietly, \u201cYou are his assistant. You should have some knowledge of basic medical treatments. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to help if he suffers minor injuries or a cold in the field.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was really too much if every assistant had to become a backup doctor!</p><br/><p>However, Luo Ru had no objections. She usually liked to do her best. Therefore, she nodded solemnly and agreed to the proposal.</p><br/><p>It felt strange to stay in this bedroom. Luo Ru gulped and whispered, \u201cMr. Xi, I will go and cook porridge in the kitchen. If you want\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should go back to the company first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru jerked and could only listen as Xi Ze said indifferently, \u201cYou are his assistant. But after all, he is ill and his mind isn\u2019t very clear. A man and woman being alone in a room together\u2026 it isn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did she think it was more inappropriate for him to be here?!!!</p><br/><p>Luo Ru\u2019s heart was depressed but she left Ming Yu\u2019s home. It wasn\u2019t because of the \u2018man and woman being alone in a room together.\u2019 It was because she discovered that Xi Ze would take care of the patient better than her.</p><br/><p>She told Xi Ze the important things about Ming Yu and left. She didn\u2019t know that after she left, Xi Ze returned to the bedroom and sat next to the youth\u2019s bed.</p><br/><p>The youth on the bed had red cheeks and white lips. His eyes were closed tightly, but they were constantly shaking under the eyelids. His long eyelashes fluttered, as if he was in pain, and his forehead was wet from the sweat.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze pushed the wet hair to one side, revealing the youth\u2019s white forehead.</p><br/><p>The current Ming Yu didn\u2019t have the momentum of the past. He had a sickly beauty, causing Xi Ze\u2019s heart to slightly shake.</p><br/><p>No matter what, his muse was always beautiful.</p><br/><p>He was so beautiful that he made Xi Ze resolutely abandon all his work to come here.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s slender fingers slowly descended from the youth\u2019s eyes, along the beautiful curves of the face to the youth\u2019s lips. Xi Ze looked at the lips that were slightly dry from the illness and frowned slightly. Then he gently rubbed the delicate lips with his fingers.</p><br/><p>His movements were gentle but touching the most delicate place was bound to cause a sensitive reaction.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze sat by the bed in silence, stroking the dry lips with his fingers, as if to make them feel better. But in the next second, the boy opened his hazy eyes, stretched out a hand and pulled Xi Ze down!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

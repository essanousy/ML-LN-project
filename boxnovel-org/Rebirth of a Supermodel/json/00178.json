He thought he had seen the world but in fact, he had always been protected by his mother.</p><br/><p>He was able to argue with Xi Ze in the beginning because he thought Xi Ze wouldn\u2019t want to go against his mother. But once Xi Ze regarded him as a dead thing, the cold aura left Andrew not being about to retort a single word.</p><br/><p>Could he really exceed the world\u2019s top supermodel?</p><br/><p>This imposing manner made a person completely unable to speak. Andrew withered and didn\u2019t dare say a single word to refute it.</p><br/><p>Although Mr. Leo said he wouldn\u2019t manage Andrew anymore, he still sent someone to pack this disgusting guy back to the United States. Next, Master Leo invited Ming Yu to dinner in order to make amends for his old friend\u2019s son.</p><br/><p>After the meal, Mr. Leo hoped that Ming Yu wouldn\u2019t blame Andrew too much. He said that Andrew was only a 17 year old child and that he had been spoiled by his mother from a young age, but his heart wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>But before he left, the youth who seemed very kind asked with a smile, \u201cMaster Leo, do you know how old I am this year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo squinted and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and replied, \u201cI am 18 year old. 11 months older than Andrew Wallen. He is already at an age where the phrases \u2018young ignorance\u2019 and youthful rashness\u2019 can\u2019t be used. It absolutely has a direct relationship with him being spoiled. If you really want to be good to him, you should think about how to educate the child in the future instead of apologizing for him. Today Andrew ran into a person he can\u2019t provoke and can only apologize. What about tomorrow? He meets a person he can offend and you will help him. Master Leo, please think about it. And thank you for your hospitality this evening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t linger any longer.</p><br/><p>Leo Todd stood still, the words of the youth echoing in his mind.</p><br/><p>However, there was something that Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t tell Master Leo. These people should think about how to educate Andrew. Andrew wasn\u2019t young and he couldn\u2019t change his extreme temper.</p><br/><p>Unless he was willing to make a big effort or unless Andrew suffered and suffered, maybe there would be a change.</p><br/><p>Obviously Andrew was unwilling to suffer from this type of torture. His mother, Mrs. Wallen would also be unwilling.</p><br/><p>After the dinner, Ming Yu didn\u2019t return to the hotel. Now that Xi Ze arrived, Ming Yu would naturally move into Xi Ze\u2019s apartment in London. Then he asked how this guy suddenly arrived in London one day earlier.</p><br/><p>Ji and Ya were also preparing for the high-end fashion show at the end of October. Therefore, Xi Ze decided to come to Ruth Mary\u2019s high-end show. If Mingxiao had known this man had actually arrived in London, he naturally wouldn\u2019t have endured the shackles of a dirty villain and allowed the other to act like a tyrant towards him.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think that Ming Xiaoyu was an upright person who didn\u2019t want to rely on external forces. His Xiaoxi was in such a good position. Since he could be used, Ming Yu naturally wouldn\u2019t close the door!</p><br/><p>As he thought about this, Ming Yu scolded, \u201cIf you were there early, why did you watch me being bullied by Andrew? He dared to insult Huaxia and our people in front of me. I have been scolded by him. Didn\u2019t you come too late?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI originally wanted to let you handle it yourself. And didn\u2019t you record it? I only came forward because I was with Leo and Andrew called Leo. Leo wasn\u2019t good enough to keep silent.\u201d Xi Ze\u2019s lips thinned, \u201cYou don\u2019t like this simple and crude way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s lips curved. \u201cTo deal with this type of scum, you are the best choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the two men were tired out, Xi Ze asked, \u201cWill you release the recording? I can find a media outlet to release it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cNot the time being. Andrew will be blocked for one year so it won\u2019t make any difference to him now. Maybe a lot of people would\u2019ve forgotten about it one year later. I will wait and find the right opportunity to release it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze nodded in agreement. The two people took a shower and the youth was blow drying his hair. Xi Ze suddenly hugged him from behind and whispered, \u201cWasn\u2019t I handsome today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was blank for a moment. Then he grinned and said, \u201cNot handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The beautiful youth turned around, held the man\u2019s neck and kissed him. Then he said, \u201cYou are handsome every day!\u201d The youth deliberately licked his lips, making the bright red lips become more tempting.</p><br/><p>This tempting scene caused a man\u2019s pupils to deepen!</p><br/><p>Could he still tolerate this? He must let this goblin know how difficult it was!</p><br/><p>In the night, low breathing echoed in the quiet bedroom. The bed was quickly creased and halfway through, Ming Yu didn\u2019t notice but he unexpectedly fell off the bed. Ming Xiaoyu was stunned and hadn\u2019t recovered when the man actually came down from the bed, directly abandoning the warm and comfortable bed!</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow I have the show\u2026um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, I have a sense of moderation.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the early hours, even the moon was shyly hiding behind the clouds and reluctant to come out. In the distant United States, the bustling night scene illuminated the large sky and people went about the colourful nightlife.</p><br/><p>Once Andrew Wallen landed, the two bodyguards responsible for sending him back finally stopped staring at him and took the opportunity to return to the UK. But Andrew\u2019s expression was already dark and the things under the surface were about to break out. Under Andrew\u2019s gaze, the agent was also sweating.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never been so humiliated!\u201d</p><br/><p>The agent didn\u2019t hear it for a moment and asked, \u201cAh Andrew, what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew gritted his teeth, revealing a dangerous expression that caused the agent to shiver with fright. He could only listen as Andrew said, \u201cI have never been so humiliated my whole life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Ze!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are simply bullying me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou forced me to do this! You forced me to do this!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew\u2019s mad appearance caused some airport tourists to look at him with surprise. The people who knew him were curious enough to pick up their phone to take a photo, causing the agent to hurriedly pull Andrew away.</p><br/><p>Once they arrived at a quiet place, the agent said carefully, \u201cThat\u2026 Andrew, I don\u2019t think that you should mess with Xi Ze right now. Xi Ze\u2019s position in the fashion world isn\u2019t as simple as you think. Even Master Raymond must give him face and not offend him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew\u2019s face changed. \u201cWhy? Then I just have to be bullied by him? This is the United States, not Huaxia!\u201d</p><br/><p>The agent scolded in his heart, \u2018What does Huaxia or the United States matter? Do you really think Xi Ze can\u2019t reach you in the United States?\u2019</p><br/><p>However, the agent only thought this. He suggested, \u201cAndrew, it is true that we can\u2019t offend Xi Ze but we can make trouble for Ming Yu! Today Xi Ze stepped forward because he heard you insult Huaxia people. Ming Yu is just slightly famous in Huaxia. If he really knew Xi Ze, he would\u2019ve appeared in Ji and Ya early on. We will get rid of the small model. If you tell Mrs. Wallen, she will help you teach that small model a lesson!\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew was still very unwilling. He was bullied so miserably and reprimanded by Master Leo because of Xi Ze. But he wasn\u2019t that stupid. He naturally knew that he didn\u2019t have any advantage against Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Then he would get rid of this small model first.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t offend Xi Ze? Then he would teach this small model!</p><br/><p>Wait for it!</p><br/><p>Before he left the airport, Andrew called his mother and sobbed about being forced back to the United States by Master Leo. Once Mrs. Wallen heard her son\u2019s cries, she couldn\u2019t sit still. She immediately drove to the airport and took her baby son home.</p><br/><p>On the way, she comforted Andrew while listening to his story.</p><br/><p>In Andrew\u2019s narrative, he was just young and slightly provoked Ming Yu. The little model scolded him, insulted him and said he relied on his mother to reach this point.</p><br/><p>After that, Xi Ze suddenly appeared and helped the small Huaxia model bully him. Even Master Leo was on their side, working together to bully Andrew and even sending him back to the United States.</p><br/><p>At first, Mrs. Wallen didn\u2019t react to Andrew\u2019s explanation. But once she heard about Xi Ze, she was stunned and asked with a strange expression, \u201cYou just said that Xi Ze ran out to help that small model bully you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew nodded and cried out, \u201cMom, I have never been so bullied. You must help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>A 17 year old youth with a height of 191cm cried to his mother, it was really surprising. However, Mrs. Wallen just hugged her son with a pained heard and said, \u201cYes, your mother will help you! Don\u2019t cry again. Even if you are pretending to cry, I will feel distressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The agent\u2019s mouth twitched as he saw this situation but he remained silent.</p><br/><p>The fact that Andrew Wallen could become like this, Mrs. Wallen was really deserving to be called a \u2018great hero!\u2019</p><br/><p>Andrew returned to his room to adjust his mood. Mrs. Wallen spoke to the manager with a gloomy expression and asked him to tell the whole truth.</p><br/><p>Once she heard that Andrew dared to scold Xi Ze and it was for a whole 10 minutes, Mrs. Wallen really didn\u2019t know how to describe her complicated mood.</p><br/><p>She pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cThis thing, don\u2019t talk about it. At that time, not many people saw and the video in the parking lot doesn\u2019t record sound. There is no need to worry about it for the moment. I will apologize to Leo. He won\u2019t mind since he also watched Andrew grow up. As for Xi Ze\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Mrs. Wallen made up her mind. \u201cI will give him a statement and not let him be troubled by Andrew. As for that Ming Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mrs. Wallen sneered disdainfully. \u201cSince he is just a small model with no background, I will teach him a lesson. You will handle it with my assistant. I would like to see what a model who hasn\u2019t entered the supermodel rankings can do to me!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

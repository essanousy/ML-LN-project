After a few days, Zhao Rui spoke emotionally, \u201cXiaoyu, your popularity might be far less than He Chaoman, Luo Cheng and Xi Ze, but compared to other people, your popularity is really growing too fast!\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was the case!</p><br/><p>In a short span of six months, Ming Yu rose from an ordinary third-tier model under Zhao Rui to one of the most popular second-tier models in Huaxia. Zhao Rui recently received a lot of domestic first-tier endorsement invitations, as well as some magazine cover invitations. This showed\u2014</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wasn\u2019t an obscure young model, he could even be regarded as a first-tier model.</p><br/><p>To be honest, in both the fashion industry and entertainment industry, fans weren\u2019t very sensitive about the line between first-tier and second-tier.</p><br/><p>Fans only liked their idols. They paid attention to this person, loved this person and spent money on this person, that was all.</p><br/><p>Of course, the difference between top models and first-tier models was still great. A top model could absolutely enter the world\u2019s top supermodel rankings, but there were some popular general models who could barely be considered top.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s Weibo fans and official website fans exceeded a few other first-tier models. Most of his, his income in the past six months wasn\u2019t low. So why wasn\u2019t he considered a first-tier model?</p><br/><p>It was because Ming Yu hadn\u2019t yet appeared as the cover of a first-tier magazine.</p><br/><p>Each of Huaxia\u2019s first-tier magazines were monthly magazines, and they each had their own sub-division magazines such as jewellery, clothing and sports cars. In total, there were around a dozen first-tier magazines going on sale every month. Appearing on the cover of a first-tier magazine, whether it was the main issue or a sub-issue, this was the line between a first and second-tier model.</p><br/><p>On New Year\u2019s Eve, Zhao Rui knew that Ming Yu\u2019s parents died early and invited Ming Yu to eat at his home. Once Ming Yu arrived with a gift, the door opened to reveal Zhao Rui\u2019s parents, Zhao Rui and\u2026 Zhou Wei Zhuo.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was a little startled for a moment before he smiled. He looked meaningfully towards Zhao Rui and cried out, \u201cBrother Zhao, Happy New Year! The youth paused before whispering, \u201cBrother Zhao, why is Sister Wei here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was surprised and asked, \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t A\u2019Wei be here?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Ming Yu nodded and asked no more questions.</p><br/><p>They ate together and Zhao Rui happily gave Ming Yu a few announcements. \u201cThere are currently two first-tier magazines who have invited you to appear on the cover of their March issue. One is Lanka and the other is Character. You can choose the one you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, Zhao Rui looked cheerful and was glowing. He was apparently very happy. Ming Yu became aware of something. \u201cBrother Zhao, no matter what magazine I choose, I can be a first-tier model as long as the magazine is released in March?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was surprised and blinked at Xiaoyu several times. Finally, he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cMing Yu, you are the most honest model I have every met. In times like this, shouldn\u2019t you modestly say that you will like it no matter what magazine and that it is hard to choose? Is it really okay to show your ambitions so clearly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t say anything after hearing these words. Zhou Wei Zhuo, who was carrying fruit, laughed, \u201cMing Xiaoyu, you are one of us. If you accept either Lanka or Character\u2019s invitation, you will formally step through the door of the first-tier models. What is so embarrassing about saying this openly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo placed the fruit on the coffee table and continued, \u201cI suggest that you choose Character. Recently, Character\u2019s momentum is very strong. Chen Rongchen cleaned out the inside of the magazine a few months ago and their new lineup is very powerful. Naturally, you have to choose Character. Don\u2019t choose Lanka.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui protested, \u201cA\u2019Wei, why are you so frank when talking badly about others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo waved her hands. \u201cBesides you and Ming Yu, who else is here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once these words finished, Zhao Rui couldn\u2019t hide it any longer and laughed. \u201cYes! You will soon become a first-tier model! Ming Yu, I didn\u2019t expect you to reach this point so quickly. Really great! Yes, we will choose Character! The Lanka company behind \u2018Lanka\u2019 is holding them back, so let\u2019s go with Character!\u201d</p><br/><p>After chatting a while, Zhao Rui sent Ming Yu to the ground floor while calling a car to drive Ming Yu back.</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu sat in the back seat, Zhao Rui suddenly realized that Ming Yu was 18 years old this year. On his birthday, Ming Yu could apply for a driver\u2019s license. Therefore, he told Ming Yu about this matter.</p><br/><p>No matter in which world, the eve of Chinese New Year was always the most peaceful moment in the capital.</p><br/><p>There were no traffic jams on the road. Ming Yu sat in the back of the taxi and leaned against the soft chair, looking out at the night view of the city.</p><br/><p>Colourful neon lights rendered this city of steel into an ocean of light. The red, purple, yellow, green and all types of combined colours created a strange beauty, so that Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help marvelling at the optical beauty created by this coincidence.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s apartment was quite a distance from the Muse apartments. As he travelled from one end of the city to the other on this silent and cold winter night, Ming Yu realized he had been in this world for more than half a year and felt a trace of loneliness.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think about it too much, choosing to bow his head and silently play with his phone. He looked through the fan posts on the forum of his official website and sometimes saw his fans\u2019 Weibo messages.</p><br/><p>These words that entered the youth\u2019s clear eyes from the cold screen could be considered a type of warmth.</p><br/><p>It was inconvenient for taxis to enter the gate of the community, so Ming Yu got off and walked into the community.</p><br/><p>A person walking on the still and dark path, the tall and handsome young man had his hands in his coat pockets and looked at the pebbles on the ground, slowing walking forward.</p><br/><p>The weather might\u2019ve warmed up, but it was still a little cold at night. The heat exhaled from Ming Yu\u2019s mouth formed a white fog in the cold air, but he deliberately didn\u2019t speed up his steps to enter his home earlier. Instead, he moved forward at a slow pace.</p><br/><p>By the time he reached the door of the apartment building, Ming Yu\u2019s cheeks were red from the cold. He seemed to feel the cold at the moment and hastened to enter the building.</p><br/><p>He entered the code for the first access and was able to walk to the second access door. But as he was taking out the card, he suddenly heard a mellow voice from behind him. \u201cYou returned so late, have you eaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s eyes widened with surprise and he reflexively looked back.</p><br/><p>It was no different from three months ago!</p><br/><p>This man still unexpectedly appeared behind him and suddenly spoke aloud.</p><br/><p>The astonished eyes looked at Xi Ze for a long time, before Ming Yu\u2019s lips curved and he reluctantly said, \u201cXi Ze, you are actually really scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The configuration of the Muse apartments was actually very good.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was originally assigned to a third-tier model, so the size was quite small. However, it didn\u2019t seem crowded, it was just right.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu invited Xi Ze into the apartment, then went into the kitchen to pour water. Ming Yu remembered Xi Ze\u2019s paranoia with cleanliness, so when he came out with the water, he also specifically prepared several clean paper towers. He hadn\u2019t yet handed over the paper towels when Xi Ze directly pulled one from his pocket and carefully wiped the glass.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Forcing himself to ignore this snake disease, Ming Yu drank hot water and said, \u201cBrother Zhao invited me to his house for dinner, so I came back a little late tonight. But Xi Ze, why are you suddenly looking for me? Is something going on? You should\u2019ve told me in advance on the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they were already friends, Ming Yu naturally treated Xi Ze with the same attitude that he used with Zhao Rui, Luo Ru and some other people.</p><br/><p>After carefully wiping for a minute, Xi Ze put down the cup and threw the towel in the bin next to the coffee table. In front of Ming Yu\u2019s \u201c?\uff3f?\u201d disdainful eyes, Xi Ze replied, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a big deal. I thought you would be eating alone on New Year\u2019s Eve and came to eat with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s first reaction to these words wasn\u2019t to be touched. He raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cDid you check my information?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly smiled, \u201cDidn\u2019t you write it on your official website?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu PK by God Xi, Ming Xiaoyu KO!</p><br/><p>He helplessly raised a hand and said, \u201cThen I have to thank you for your concern. But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t cook. If you haven\u2019t eaten, we can go downstairs to the coffee store next door. Maybe they haven\u2019t closed yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are closed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly looked up. \u201cThey closed after I finished eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you say that you wanted to eat with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked at the youth\u2019s expression and a smile flashed in his dark eyes. He waved a hand and said helplessly, \u201cWaiting for you is very\u2026 I thought you might not return for an hour and went to eat something first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you say that you arrived 10 minutes ago?!!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When stopped by this classy lady, Ming Yu stopped and didn\u2019t think about leaving quickly.</p><br/><p>You see, the gap between people was that big.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ming Yu didn\u2019t stop for the woman because of her beautiful and elegant appearance. Ming Yu heard the words \u2018Fei Sixin\u2019 and several images and information crossed his head. He immediately understood who this woman was.</p><br/><p>After a little negotiation, the four people left the parking lot and went to a cafe not far from the venue to negotiate Fei Sixin\u2019s proposal.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was really amazed when my father showed me your photo last month.\u201d Fei Sixin was an active and enthusiastic person. She seemed to act as the \u2018host\u2019 as the waiter brought coffee. She took the initiative to hand out sugar packets to them and then spoke. \u201cMing Yu, your image is very consistent with my designs. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when I saw your photo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin and Luo Ru was sitting on one side, while Ming Yu and Zhao Rui sat on the other side.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was putting sugar into his coffee. At Fei Sixin\u2019s words, he subconsciously looked up to see the other person staring at him with shining eyes.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For each designer, the model who could show off their design most vividly was their angel. At this moment, in Fei Sixin\u2019s eyes, this handsome youth was like a 1000-watt lightbulb and he exuded a dazzling aura!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu gently coughed before smiling calmly. \u201cThank you for your compliment, Miss Fei. In fact, it is because your design is so clever and beautiful and Master Fei\u2019s photographer techniques are superb. That is how the photo turned out so well.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, it was just a photo of Ming Yu and the one who took the photo was Master Fei. The level of a top photographer was really unmatched. They had their own ideas about light and shapes. Master Fei was able to make reasonable use of the lightning to take a vividly gorgeous photo.</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin waved her hands at his words, \u201cJust call me Sixin, Min Yu. You don\u2019t have to be so modest. Even my father, that prideful person, has acknowledged your photos and he thinks that you are very strong. I was really surprised when I saw you at the Pei Feng fashion show. The level of your walk is amazing! At that time, I felt that the problem plaguing me for months could finally be solved!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu slightly narrowed his eyes at this remark and he felt enlightened. Zhao Rui and Luo Ru glanced at each other with surprise, as if they didn\u2019t quite understand Fei Sixin\u2019s meaning.</p><br/><p>They just listened as Fei Si Xin continued speaking. \u201cThe first set of clothing you wore for Pei Feng was made out of leather. To be honest, in recent years, Pei Feng\u2019s style has been inclined to be more youthful, while leather is old and mature. It is hard for young models to take control of this leather jacket. But your performance was really good. Your runway control ranks at the top of the few models I\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words really contained too much praise. Fei Sixin seemed to want to say something else, but Zhao Rui immediately interrupted. \u201cMiss Fei, thank you for your compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin no longer spoke on this topic. She smiled and said, \u201cIn fact, the last set of clothing with the jacket really touched me. I really like the feeling that you gave off when wearing that jacket. You are still young and your facial features haven\u2019t fully developed. However, your aura on the catwalk is very strong. I like the mature feeling that shines through your youth and I feel like it is very similar with my inspiration.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, even the simple Zhao Rui could understand Fei Sixin\u2019s meaning.</p><br/><p>His hands lightly grasped the white porcelain coffee cup on the table as Ming Yu raised his eyes and laughed lightly. \u201cCan I call you\u2026 Sister Xin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin was 23 years old this yaer. There was absolutely no problem with Ming Yu called her \u2018Sister Xin.\u2019</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin immediately nodded. \u201cYes, but Ming Yu, you don\u2019t have to use honorifics with me. I am only five years older than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t argue about this issue. He just bluntly asked, \u201cWell, Sister Xin. I think I understand what you mean. You feel that I am very much in line with your designs\u2026 is it the fashion collection from the \u201818 years old\u2019 column?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin replied, \u201cYes, it is that collection. However, after using a few photos of you as inspiration, I made a few improvements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was slightly stunned after hearing this. \u2018She is a very talented designer,\u2019 flew through his mind. Then he straightforwardly said, \u201cSo after the improvements, you are hoping that I will take a few more shots for you. Or do you want me to participate in the fashion show?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui and even Luo Ru were stunned by Ming Yu\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>According to Luo Ru\u2019s thoughts, it was clear that Fei Sixin came to talk to Ming Yu about cooperating. As for the cooperation, she imagined that it would be some photos. After all, Ming Yu was only 17 years old this year. He was still young and lacked experience with catwalks. A photoshoot was the only reason a design would come to talk to him about cooperating.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it impossible for her to specifically ask Ming Yu to become the chief model?</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin was also amazed for a while, before she nodded. \u201cYes Ming Yu, I want to invite you to be my fashion show\u2019s chief model.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The female assistant wearing silver glasses had just taken a sip of coffee, causing her to choke with a red face. It lasted until Zhao Rui handed her a cup of boiled water and Luo Ru took a few sips, taking little gasps for air.</p><br/><p>\u2026It really was the chief model?</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin spoke emotionally. \u201cI have hesitated for a few months, I didn\u2019t dare hold a fashion show. But after seeing your performance today, I felt like I was seeing hope and became really confident. Ming Yu, you are the person I am looking for, the one who will be able to express my inspiration. I hope you will consider my request and become the chief model of my fashion show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled helplessly and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cSister Xin, you know that I am just an ordinary second or third-tier model from Muse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin waved her hand lightly. \u201cThen I am also a new fashion designer who has never held a fashion show.\u201d</p><br/><p>But this new designer had already published her works in Fashion Entertainment!</p><br/><p>Now that Fei Sixin made such a sincere request, Ming Yu readily agreed to the other\u2019s offer. As if she was impatient, Fei Sixin hurried to find her lawyer so that Ming Yu could sign the contract on the spot.</p><br/><p>Before signing, Ming Yu kindly reminded her again, \u201cSister Xin, my reputation is really not high. It is far less than Cheng Su, Zhai Liwen and other first-tier models. You have to think clearly. This is the chief model, it is really impor\u2026tant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s words were drowned out by the look in Fei Sixin\u2019s eyes that said \u2018Sign it. I have considered clearly.\u2019 After Fei Sixin and Zhao Rui also signed their names, Fei Sixin took away the contract, not giving Ming Yu a chance to feel regret.</p><br/><p>This action was really consistent with Fei Sixin\u2019s 23 years of age, causing Ming Yu to feel dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>However, as they prepared to separate, the \u2018young and energetic\u2019 female designer solemnly shook hands with him. She said, \u201cMing Yu, you might think that appointing a new person as my chief model is very risky, but I have always believed in my own vision. Your shallow qualifications don\u2019t mean that your strength is poor. You are the chief model that I want. I chose you because you can express the feeling that I want. It isn\u2019t a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the bright sunset, Fei Sixin strode out of the cafe, leaving Ming Yu to look after her. The young female designer wore a leather coat that suited her style. It was upright and elegant. Her appearance might be regarded as an ordinary beauty, but she left a deep impression on Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled wryly and left the cafe with Zhao Rui and Luo Ru, heading towards the parking lot.</p><br/><p>\u2026So, who got the benefits in the end?</p><br/><p>Perhaps this was a matter of mutual benefits, a win-win situation. The female designer saw a tiger in a pig and let him sign the contract.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu shook the thoughts away and started discussing with Zhao Rui and Luo Ru about the talk show he would appear on next week.</p><br/><p>The sun slowly sank towards the horizon, witnessing the day\u2019s departure, while everything was quiet. Nothing seemed to have changed, but once the sun rose again, the number of visits to Pei Feng\u2019s official website would create a new record in 2016!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

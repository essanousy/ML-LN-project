Ding Bo panted as he ran behind him, intending to drive to the hospital. However, Xi Ze directly grabbed the keys from his hand and ordered solemnly, \u201cThe things here, deal with the trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo froze for a moment. He stared at the back of the car and didn\u2019t make a noise.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo had known Xi Ze for over 10 times. This was the first time he had seen Xi Ze look so serious and solemn. His expressionless face was the same as usual, but Xi Ze was furious. His eyes were cold and the atmosphere around him made people shudder.</p><br/><p>However, Ding Bo didn\u2019t know that Xi Ze deliberately suppressed some of this pressure.</p><br/><p>It was because as he walked out of the small building, the youth in his eyes suddenly pulled at his collar, his eyes struggling to open. Ming Yu spoke in a weak voice, \u201cXi Ze\u2026I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was conscious!</p><br/><p>This meant the problem wasn\u2019t big!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s heart was half calmed down but he still couldn\u2019t let go of the feelings after seeing the blood on the youth\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>But after driving Ming Yu to the hospital, the result obtained was somewhat surprising. The blood on Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s head wasn\u2019t from his head but his head. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with the head. There was a slight concussion but there wasn\u2019t even any broken skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe back of the head was covered by the hand during the impact, so it is just a minor concussion.\u201d The doctor said after a careful examination. \u201cHowever, although the hand isn\u2019t broken or fractured, the bruises are very serious. The blood flow needs to be maintained well. There is also some muscle strain on the legs and he might not be able to walk for a short time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor stated that Ming Xiaoyu only had problems with his right hand and legs, as well as a slight concussion. Xi Ze was still uneasy and gave the youth a whole body examination. He learned that there were really no other problems and slowly let go of his feelings.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze watched from the sidelines as the doctor disinfected and bandaged Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s right hand.</p><br/><p>Previously, Ming Xiaoyu had struggled to say a few words before fainting again. He still hadn\u2019t woken up. Despite iodine being used to clean the back of his bleeding hand, Ming Yu just frowned and didn\u2019t open his eyes.</p><br/><p>The doctor spoke with great appreciation that Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s actions were very clever. Both legs slowed down the impact force and then his hand withstood the impact to the brain. The bones of the hand weren\u2019t even fractured so the injuries weren\u2019t serious.</p><br/><p>But in Xi Ze\u2019s heart, he looked at the youth\u2019s bruised hand and slowly squeezed his fingers.</p><br/><p>The originally slender white hand was full of horrible purple bruises. From the centre of the hand to the back, there were three cuts. The blood might\u2019ve stopped but the dried bloodstain showed a shocking black.</p><br/><p>In this world, only the well-informed doctors and nurses would fell that this wound wasn\u2019t much.</p><br/><p>Yes, there were just bruises on the back of the hand. There were three small cuts and the bleeding was easily stopped. However, in Xi Ze\u2019s eyes, this was simply putting his heart in an over. It was hot and the pain was intolerable.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care how small the wound was. He only knew that his youth was definitely hurt.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ding Bo stayed behind to deal with the follow-up matters and learned about the development of things from Luo Ru and Fang Liangxiu. Jiang Kaiyang made a mistake when acting. As a result, he suffering an injury when hanging from the wires. Ming Yu was injured trying to save him.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo frowned when he heard \u2018Ming Yu zealously stepped forward and pulled Jiang Kaiyang\u2019 and felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>He might not have a lot of contact with Ming Yu but his sharp vision had seen that Ming Yu wasn\u2019t a good person. Ming Yu didn\u2019t inherit Zhao Rui\u2019s foolish and sweet nature. He was very intelligent and rational. He wouldn\u2019t be blinded by momentary feelings.</p><br/><p>Such a Ming Yu would risk his life and take the initiative to save someone?</p><br/><p>Ding Bo detected something wrong. He looked up and met Luo Ru\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at each other with tacit agreement and moved to one side. Ding Bo softly asked, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru was still very nervous about Ming Xiaoyu and wanted to see him now. But she knew that Ming Yu wouldn\u2019t have any problems when Xi Ze was with him. Zhao Rui wasn\u2019t present right now. As Ming Yu\u2019s assistant, Luo Ru must assume responsibility.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru spoke with a pale face, \u201cWe were all standing underneath and didn\u2019t see what was going on. The staff standing above said that Xiaoyu suddenly rushed to save a person. They didn\u2019t know exactly what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo thought about it as he kept listening to Luo Ru. \u201cMr. Ding, I think that you should be on Xiaoyu\u2019s side and familiar with him. Others wouldn\u2019t know it but you and Mr. Xi must know that Xiaoyu isn\u2019t the type of person who would risk his own life to save others. Moreover, the person he saved is someone who he has a bad relationship with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo\u2019s eyes narrowed when he heard this. \u201cWhat do you mean? He has a bad relationship with Jiang Kaiyang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru nodded.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo thought again before finally say, \u201cThis matter, put it in your heart and don\u2019t speak about it. The fact is that Ming Yu saved Jiang Kaiyang and is wounded. If this matter can\u2019t be ignored, remember that you must emphasize \u2018Ming Yu\u2019s rescued Jiang Kaiyang.\u2019 At the same time, make it clear that this incident was caused by Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru nodded with great understanding. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo and Luo Ru started plotting. They talked about how to handle this matter and prevent the outside media from knowing. Assuming that the outside media knew, how should they control the story and make it flow to their side?</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t notice that the entire crew, except for a few important crew members, went to the hospital. Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s assistant also anxiously went to the hospital and didn\u2019t stay behind to clean up the mess.</p><br/><p>By the time Ding Bo and Luo Ru noticed, a Weibo message had been published and created a monstrous wave.</p><br/><p>Regardless of the ups and downs of the outside world, the hospital was always the most peaceful place.</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu woke up, the first thing he saw was a clean white ceiling and and a water drip. The unique smell of the hospital stimulated Ming Xiaoyu to wake up. He hadn\u2019t moved yet when he felt a person suddenly feel his wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you, is your head still faint? Does your hand hurt? How do your legs feel? Can you move?\u201d</p><br/><p>The series of questions made the youth\u2019s mouth open in surprise, not knowing which once to answer. Ming Yu turned his head and saw the man sitting beside his bed.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s face was pale and his eyes bloodshot. He looked very haggard. Despite this, he was so handsome that people couldn\u2019t move their eyes from him.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu felt better looking at him. He smiled and asked, \u201cHow did you come today? I thought you had to deal with some Ji and Ya things and would come tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s brow furrowed and he asked in a low voice, \u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu moved his legs slightly and then his wrist. \u201cI\u2019m okay. My leg muscles are a bit sore but it isn\u2019t a major issue. The back of my hand\u2026did I fracture anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze felt anger rising from the bottom of his heart at the youth\u2019s calm tone. He tried to suppress it. \u201cThere is no fracture.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was immediately relieved. \u201cAs long as there is no fracture, it shouldn\u2019t be a big problem. I just need to look after it and it will be fine in a couple of weeks. By the way, you didn\u2019t answer my question., How did you come so suddenly?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s words completely irritated Xi Ze. He suddenly released the youth\u2019s wrist and got up. He placed his hands on both sides of the boy\u2019s pillow and leaned over, looking down at the youth. He stared at the handsome face and emphasized, \u201cThe, point, now, is, that, you, are, hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>The unique aura of the top supermodel spread out from and covered the injured youth. The weak and vulnerable Ming Xiaoyu was shocked. He could only stare speechless at Xi Ze with big eyes.</p><br/><p>In the hearts of Ming Yu and the doctors, this type of injury wasn\u2019t really an injury. It was just a bruise and his bones weren\u2019t even hurt. He just needed to take care of it and there wouldn\u2019t even be a scar.</p><br/><p>However, in Xi Ze\u2019s heart, not a single hair on this youth\u2019s head was allowed to be hurt!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had never seen Xi Ze so angry. He was dismayed but he couldn\u2019t help his heart softening. A warm feeling flowed from his heart towards his both. Despite the stinging from the back of his head, he felt very warm.</p><br/><p>The youth slightly raised his body and gently kissed the man\u2019s lips. Then he smiled, \u201cIn order to not worry you, I was originally going to tell you that I feel good and that there is no problem. But since you are so concerned, I don\u2019t mind telling you that it hurts. It really hurts. When the back of my hand hit the wall, I almost fainted from the pain. I don\u2019t want to see the cause of this pain, Jiang Kaiyang for the rest of my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze became angrier when he heard this name.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing Bo said you were hurt saving him. In my eyes, it doesn\u2019t matter if he dies. You went forward to save him, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are worth 10 of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was originally a cold and distant person. His tone was natural when he uttered such words. In his heart, Jiang Kaiyang was just a name. He could be a man or a woman, tall or short and it wouldn\u2019t interest Xi Ze. In his heart, Jiang Kaiyang wasn\u2019t comparable to a single strand of hair on his youth\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sighed helplessly. Then he winked and asked, \u201cDo you think I saved him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips narrowed. \u201cNo.\u201d Then he said, \u201cBut you still moved forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu cried out bitterly, \u201cWhere did I want to save him? If I didn\u2019t pull him to me, I would\u2019ve been pulled by him! Then things would be worse than they are now!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They only needed to record two games and some easter eggs, and it would be all over.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s state today was obviously not as good as it was yesterday. His partner Du Ruo frowned and asked if he wanted to rest for a while. After all, he was shocked twice by \u2018Violent Waterfall\u2019 yesterday and recording the program was very stressful.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu smiled slightly, swallowed to ease the dryness in his throat and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Sister Du, I\u2019m fine. I am much better than I was last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Ruo slightly frowned and didn\u2019t say anything else. However, her eyes were on Cheng Su not far away.</p><br/><p>Today, Cheng Su\u2019s face was very poor, an extreme contrast to his high spirits yesterday. It was estimated that what happened yesterday was discovered by his agent and he was scolded.</p><br/><p>Even if he didn\u2019t know the spokesperson of Rayleigh Cano\u2019s 2014 perfume, he couldn\u2019t show it. It might not be the product and series he was endorsing, but it was still Rayleigh Cano.</p><br/><p>Once this matter was exposed, Zeng Shu could guess how furious the head of Rayleigh Cano would be.</p><br/><p>It was even likely that Cheng Su would lose the endorsement!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the program hadn\u2019t aired yet and this incident wasn\u2019t so serious. After all, it was understandable if Cheng Su didn\u2019t know what happened three years ago.</p><br/><p>Thus, Cheng Su was only mercilessly scolded for two hours last night. Once Zeng Shu\u2019s words had dried up, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you again for half a month. Until your next job, you will honestly stay home and study every incident of Rayleigh Cano from its creation to the present!\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Ruo stared at Cheng Su for a long time. Then this beautiful supermodel\u2019s lips slowly lifted and she sneered.</p><br/><p>The other person didn\u2019t notice. Then she gave hot water to Ming Xiaoyu, who had suddenly coughed, and laughed helplessly. \u201cYesterday was really too hard. Ming Xiaoyu, did you catch fish? If you are fishing, you should skillfully let others take the bite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu suddenly froze as he drank the water. He stared blankly and saw that the other person was looking at him with a smile, looking as calm and gentle as ever.</p><br/><p>The two people stared at each other for a long time before Ming Xiaoyu smiled indifferently. \u201cSister Du, your words are right. Then you\u2026 cough, do you think that it is better to put the fish back to fatten it up or to eat it right away?</p><br/><p>Du Ruo replied naturally, \u201cI want to eat it. It is just a dead fish after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the corner of the dining room, the handsome young man and the beautiful woman smiled tacitly, not speaking anymore.</p><br/><p>In the recording session of the last game, Cheng Su really felt like his body was pushed into a hot water pool. He was sweating with anger, but there was nowhere to resolve it.</p><br/><p>The last part was playing water polo. The eight guests were assigned by team and there was a goal in each of the four directions. They would obtain one point if they scored a goal.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no doubt that MIng Xiaoyu\u2019s team had already won first place with an appallingly high score. Unless a team could score 200 points during the match, it was impossible to overtake them.</p><br/><p>\u2026Scoring 200 goals was only possible if they were standing on the ground and playing non-stop, and they would also get a cramp!</p><br/><p>Thus, by the end of the day, most people already saw the show as over and didn\u2019t intend to win the game anymore. Of course, this didn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t do their best. Wasn\u2019t it good if they could win this game in the end?</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was scolded by Zeng Shu last night and was filled with anger.</p><br/><p>\u2014This was fine on the premise that no one did anything to him.</p><br/><p>When Cheng Su was about to receive the ball, Ming Xiaoyu intentionally splashed the water. Cheng Su blinked and once he opened his eyes again, the ball was gone. When Cheng Su was about to throw a ball, Ming Xiaoyu kicked in a light foul, causing Cheng Su to lose his balance. When he was ready to pass the ball to his teammates, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s smiling face suddenly appeared in front of Cheng Su and made a foul ball grab. Cheng Su was angry!</p><br/><p>Yes, this was a foul!</p><br/><p>A foul!</p><br/><p>However, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s actions were exactly at the corners of the eight cameras. Thus, his actions seemed like a normal ball grab and there wasn\u2019t a problem. Even if Cheng Su wanted to say something, he would just look bitter and he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was no longer coughing after taking a throat lozenge. However, he received too much punishment yesterday and his physical fitness really had declined. Therefore, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t score a lot of points in this game, allowing other people to hope for victory.</p><br/><p>Except for Cheng Su!</p><br/><p>This was a foul!</p><br/><p>You are a foul!</p><br/><p>It was like Ming Yu was deliberately fouling (not like, it really was intentional) Cheng Su, making him more irritable. The 10th time that Ming Yu took the ball from Cheng Su using foul means, Cheng Su couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and pushed Ming Xiaoyu!</p><br/><p>It was a clever push. Nobody was paying attention to the situation here so it was logical that nobody had seen it.</p><br/><p>However, the next second\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Cheng Su, how can you push Ming Yu like that? You did a foul!\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Ruo\u2019s shout draw everyone\u2019s attention. They saw a tall and thin young man being mercilessly pushed by another tall and burly man (Cheng Su was very proud to say that he was several centimetres taller than Ming Xiaoyu \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d).</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu kept coughing, as if he was choking on water. Meanwhile, Cheng Su was holding the ball in his arms.</p><br/><p>The director was very surprised at the situation and quickly pulled up the coughing Ming Xiaoyu. However, Ming Xiaoyu kept coughing even on dry land. It seemed the amount of water he swallowed wasn\u2019t light.</p><br/><p>The program staff rushed to observe the eight video cameras. Sure enough, in one of the cameras, Ming Yu was pushed inside the swimming pool and the ball in his arms stolen.</p><br/><p>This was a game and such nonsense wasn\u2019t permitted. The director shouted directly into the speaker, \u201cCheng Su foul, out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su, \u201c!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this crap show!</p><br/><p>Who did the foul first, clearly watch it!</p><br/><p>However, Cheng Su kept these thoughts in his heart. He understood that the director had watched the video and didn\u2019t find any signs of Ming Yu\u2019s foul actions, otherwise Ming Yu would also be out.</p><br/><p>Thus, in the last game, Cheng Su became the first and only person to be out. He sat gloomily next to the pool, while as the other seven guests laughed and played with the ball.</p><br/><p>When the camera swept over him, he suddenly changed his face and smiled. But as long as the cameras weren\u2019t paying attention, he didn\u2019t hide his gloomy face.</p><br/><p>The game ended and the three day recording was finally over.</p><br/><p>The ultimate champions were naturally Ming Yu and Du Ruo. The two people won small gold medals as the champions.</p><br/><p>When everyone applauded Ming Yu and Du Ruo\u2019s victory, Cheng Su also smiled and clapped, as if nothing had happened. However, once everyone returned to the hotel in order to pack, Ming Yu had just walked up to the elevator when he saw Cheng Su inside.</p><br/><p>In the quiet hotel corridor, no one else was present. Ming Yu stood outside the elevator and Luo Ru was already downstairs to check out. Cheng Su stood with his assistant inside the elevator, staring at the youth in front of him with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su assumed that Ming Yu would wait for the next elevator. He never expected that Ming Yu would enter the elevator calmly and say with a chuckle, \u201cMr. Cheng, are you leaving too?\u201d</p><br/><p>The language wasn\u2019t close to his natural temperament and attitude. The politeness gave off a feeling of alienation. Ming Yu was acting like nothing had happened, causing Cheng Su to sneer and say, \u201cMing Yu, your acting is really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The implication was: You are a duplicitous villain. How shameless!</p><br/><p>But Ming Yu didn\u2019t seem to understand. He covered his lips and coughed twice. Then he said, \u201cMr. Cheng, my acting skills are really bad. Many people have said that I am unsuitable for acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su replied coldly, \u201cOh really? I think you can act in front of the camera.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu shrugged helplessly, \u201cMy acting is really bad. But thank you for the compliment. I also think that my acting is quite good. It isn\u2019t any worse than my idol, the famous French model Alice Crandall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth deliberately elongated his last words. This meaningfully intonation caused Cheng Su\u2019s eyes to widen and he couldn\u2019t restrain himself anymore. \u201cMing Yu! You\u2019re overdoing it! You are just as useless as before if you think this will make me notice you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheng Su.\u201d The youth\u2019s calm and quiet voice interrupted Cheng Su. Ming Yu turned to him with cold eyes and sneered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t pester me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su cried out, \u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the elevator let out a \u2018<em>ding\u2019 </em>and the door opened. Ming Yu ignored Cheng Su and stepped out. Behind him, Cheng Su shook in fury as his eyes turned red. His assistant stood beside him and didn\u2019t dare speak.</p><br/><p>That evening, Ming Yu sat on a plane to Huaxia and quickly fell asleep under the starry sky.</p><br/><p>On the same night, Cheng Su wasn\u2019t on a plane when he suddenly received Zeng Shu\u2019s phone call. The other person yelled, \u201cDamn! Did you offend Du Ruo? When did you offend Du Ruo? Hey Cheng Su, why don\u2019t you die?\u201d</p><br/><p>The calm and refined man exploded with curses, showing how terrible the situation was. The frightened Cheng Su was stunned. He really didn\u2019t understand what had happened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But when he saw Ming Yu\u2019s face, he suddenly stopped and even showed Ming Yu the path to Xi Ze\u2019s studio.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wasn\u2019t surprised. A long time ago, Xi Ze had said that Ming Yu was always welcome to find him on the top floor. Therefore, Ming Yu guessed that Xi Ze expected him to someday come to this floor and prepared things in advance.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thanked the other person and walked down the glass corridor to the other side of the building.</p><br/><p>This floor was very quiet, the transparent glass and steel making the corridor look like it was suspended in the air. People with a fear of heights would probably be frightened. Xi Ze obviously enjoyed it. On the way to his studio, the sound of water flowing over pebbles was heard, giving it a quaint atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu walked to the mahogany door and gently knocked on it, twisting the door handle after obtaining permission to enter.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xi Ze was half leaning down and drawing on the table with a calm expression. After coming in, Xi Ze didn\u2019t give him a chance to speak. He finished a stroke and said calmly, \u201cI don\u2019t care about the things regarding Lou Cheng. Tell Shen Xiang to find him. He has been in the United States for too long. It is time to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was surprised by the words before understanding. Xi Ze thought he was Ding Bo!</p><br/><p>He gently coughed and said, \u201cXi Ze, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s hands stopped in the middle of their movements as he looked up in surprise, seeing Ming Yu smiling at him. The two people stared at each other for a moment before Ming Yu asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t expect me to come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips curved as he put down the pencil. \u201cYes, I didn\u2019t expect it to be you.\u201d There was a pause before Xi Ze added meaningful words. \u201cYou came later than I imagined.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu asked with surprise when he heard this, \u201cYou knew I would be looking for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly stood up and arranged his clothes. Then he picked up the paper towel placed on the table and wiped the fingers that were just holding a pencil. \u201cAh, I knew you would come to me. This time, is it because of the world\u2019s supermodel rankings being released next month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it. It is because of March\u2019s issue of Character?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Ming Yu\u2019s face deepened, but he still didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>After thinking carefully, Xi Ze spoke casually, \u201cIt is because of Lu Zhenxi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy because of him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like it is because of him.\u201d A playful look filled Xi Ze\u2019s deep eyes. He slowly threw the towel in the clean trash bin and walked to Ming Yu\u2019s side. \u201cIt is because I told Shen Xiang to pay more attention to him. Ah\u2026 the effect is good, you came to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s studio was empty, but it was at least five times bigger than the lounge room downstairs. This man was apparently an extreme minimalist when it came to architectural design. The room was dark blue with a silver finish, and it was quite straightforward except for the small stream at the other end of the room.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sat down on the lambskin soft and shook his head as he watched Xi Ze. \u201cIt really was you. Can you tell me why you decided to suppress him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze thought for a moment before replying. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026That is very unfair to Lu Zhenxi. He has a lot less jobs because you don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze explained calmly. \u201cHe just missed the resources assigned to him by the company. Shen Xiang didn\u2019t have to move at all.\u201d Xi Ze paused and his tone was no longer playful. \u201cI guess that you came here today to owe me a favour.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth heard these words and asked with a smile. \u201cWhat did you guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze replied calmly, \u201cYou came to plead for Lu Zhenxi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was startled as the youth suddenly laughed. \u201cThat isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu solemnly shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to plead for Lu Zhenxi. I\u2019m here today to ask you to introduce me to Director Shen of the Public Relations department and Director Xu of the Acting department. If I make Zhao Rui do this, he will have to go through a lot of trouble and it will take a long time. It will probably happen very quickly if you do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked at Ming Yu with surprise for a long time, but didn\u2019t continue the precious topic. He pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cIt might be time consuming to let Zhao Rui do this task, but you won\u2019t need to owe me a favour. Ming Yu, it is very troublesome to owe me a favour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example, Master Fei owed you a favour. You made him shoot thousands of photos for Ji and Ya, and he even had to stay late to do the post-repair work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze replied, \u201cOld Fei was very pleased to agree after learning of my request.\u201d</p><br/><p>The implication was: Master Fei\u2019s way of thinking about human relations was too simple!</p><br/><p>However, Xi Ze was surprised to find that even though Ming Yu knew how troublesome it was to owe him a favour, Ming Yu still stuck to his idea. Therefore, Xi Ze helpless made a phone call and summoned Shen Xiang and Xu Wenshu to his studio.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Xi Ze didn\u2019t directly participate. Once Shen Xiang and Xu Wenshu hurriedly arrived, he told them why he called and then sat on the single sofa, watching Ming Yu talk to them.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang was aware of the relationship between Ming Yu and Xi Ze, but Xu Wenshu had no idea at all!</p><br/><p>Xu Wenshu was in his early 40s this year, a king and handsome middle-aged uncle. Zhou Wei Zhuo came to him regarding \u2018Ming Yu\u2019 and he remembered that he had sent Ming Yu to Brother Yuan\u2019s training class. This time, Ming Yu actually looked for Xi Ze?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze and Zhou Wei Zhuo were different!</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo had a good temper and easy to talk to. Ming Yu\u2019s agent was also Zhao Rui, so it was natural for Zhou Wei Zhuo to help Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>But since when did Ming Yu have anything to do with Xi Ze?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was black-bellied and his poisonous tongue\u2026 cough, his words couldn\u2019t be broadcasted. In short, Xi Ze wasn\u2019t the type to help newcomers. Yet Ming Yu could unexpectedly move Xi Ze?</p><br/><p>Xu Wenshu solemnly looked at Ming Yu and secretly thought, \u2018There is a problem!\u2019</p><br/><p>He would get an explanation later. Ming Yu directly asked them, \u201cDirector Shen, Director Xu, I wanted to ask you something. Recently, are there any movie or television jobs for a male number two or three. The role should require good acting, but at the same time, it is very lovable. A role best suited for a new debut.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang and Xu Wenshu looked at each other with surprise at these words. Then they both turned to look at Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze just calmly blew on the hot tea in his hands and didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Finally, Shen Xiang spoke directly, \u201cThere are a few first-tier resources suitable for newcomers. Recently, there are two TV series and one movie that is good. The latter is for the male number two, with the appearance requirements and acting requirements being quite high.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Wenshu saw Shen Xiang share insider news and seemed to understand. He hurriedly added. \u201cYes, the movie is called \u2018The Gauntlet\u2019 and it is about a general in the Song Dynasty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang and Xu Wenshu finished telling all that they knew and Ming Yu gratefully shook hands with them. However, when Shen Xiang asked if he should have people allocate these jobs to Ming Yu, Ming Yu decisively rejected it, leaving Shen Xiang and Xu Wenshu at a loss.</p><br/><p>Once the mahogany door closed again with a \u2018click\u2019, Xi Ze put down the white porcelain teacup and calmly stated, \u201cYou are not suitable for acting.\u201d Xi Ze added, \u201cEspecially these three parts just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu asked, \u201cHow do you know I\u2019m not suitable for acting? I\u2019ve made a lot of progress recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>The handsome man looked at Ming Yu for a suspiciously long time and finally spoke sincerely, \u201cFor your future\u2019s sake, you should only act in a role that has a short amount of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026 (/=_=)/~\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this sympathetic stare?</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Ming Yu decided to forget the other person\u2019s words. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pick a role for me.\u201d Ming Yu didn\u2019t continue, asking instead, \u201cWhat favour do I owe you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s brow furrowed for a moment. \u201cBe my exclusive model?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was dumbfounded. \u201c\u2026That joke isn\u2019t funny at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made an innocent expression and replied, \u201cLook, I said it but you don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was silent for a moment, until he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIn fact, this \u2018\u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d\u2019 expression doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze thought carefully for a moment. \u201cThen what about this? ^_^\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This person was broken!!</p><br/><p>With a \u2018Why is Xi Ze different every time I see him?\u2019 mood, Ming Yu returned to his lounge. Ming Yu didn\u2019t know that after he left, this solemn and elegant man\u2019s smile disappeared and he spoke with some confusion, \u201cThis feeling doesn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026This thing, it really needed to be cured!!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze slightly changed himself every time, trying to find the right appearance to move the youth, letting him voluntarily become Xi Ze\u2019s own person.</p><br/><p>But there was one thing he didn\u2019t change from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>His poisonous tongue.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have this poisonous tongue, he was afraid that Ming Xiaoyu, this person would just take him as a friend!</p><br/><p>When Ding Bo finished his work and returned to the studio, the lying down Xi Ze didn\u2019t complain. Xi Ze suddenly spoke in a solemn tone, \u201cLet\u2019s go eat at Ruoshang Hall tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026Ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Ding Bo couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat special occasion it is? Did something happen today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze lightly raised an eyebrow. \u201cI am in a good mood. Why does there need to be a reason? Oh yes, remember to settle the thing with Luo Cheng. If his agent calls during the dinner, you will pay for the meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c#$#%#$! $$%#$!!!:</p><br/><p>You were the one who proposed that we go to dinner together, so why should he pay for it!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

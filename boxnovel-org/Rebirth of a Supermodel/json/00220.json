A large number of single dogs and even non-single dogs screamed a the show of love. There were also many experienced fans who carefully analyzed the fashion show and gave some comments.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Alido Xiao Li: This time I was fortunate enough to attend the Ji and Ya high end show. I have to saw that the two years of preparation made this Ji and Ya menswear show very good. The theme of \u2018gentleness of elegance\u2019 was incomprehensible at first. But throughout the show, whether it is the jackets round, the casual collection or the formal clothing, all of them contain Ji and Ya\u2019s unique elegance. Yet they also contain a rare softness. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xu Chaoyang manda: I lived @Xi Ze for many years but he has decided to become a photographer. Xi Ze hasn\u2019t walked in any high-end show for two years but he was really amazing this time. Many people who doubted his strength is forced to shut their mouths, including me. I can\u2019t believe that there is a supermodel who can show such amazing strength after two years of nothing. Of course, this is my most respected idol, Xi Ze\u2019s strength. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Falling VIVIAN: Since Nidelan\u2019s May fashion show, I have become @Ming Yu\u2019s fan. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s three outfits, the first is an orthodox jacket, the second is a more casual sweater and the third is my favourite outfit. Ming Xiaoyu is very suitable for extreme colours, such as the bright yellow sweater. This is something that many people can\u2019t control but Ming Yu perfectly interpreted it. In this fashion show, I think that Small Mushroom\u2019s performance isn\u2019t inferior to @Xi Ze. Of course, they are originally husband and wife \u256e\uff08\u256f\u25bd\u2570\uff09\u256d . Finally, I want to say: Come on, give me the golden dog food! \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>In recent years, more fresh blood had been injected into the fashion industry, making this industry have the atmosphere of young people.</p><br/><p>The video recorded the scene of the Ji and Ya fashion show, making many people curious about it become greatly shocked.</p><br/><p>So many world-class supermodels competing in the same field!</p><br/><p>This was really shocking!</p><br/><p>Before the video released, most people were worried about Ming Yu and Xi Ze\u2019s situation. The order of the two of them was too close and the world rankings were also close together. One was first, the other was second, and they were a couple!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were still modest. After all, Xi Ze\u2019s dominance in the scene was still vivid. Even if he didn\u2019t appear in a show for two years, wasn\u2019t a thin camel still bigger than a horse? What could they do if compared to Xi Ze, Ming Yu was a little bit worse? Wouldn\u2019t the sunspots start taunting him?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s fans were also relatively modest. They were active in the supermodel circle and had an attitude of \u2018you know nothing about Xi Ze\u2019 when new models wanted to go beyond Xi Ze. However, now Xi Ze hadn\u2019t walked in a show for two years. If he was worse than his wife\u2026 how sad would it be!</p><br/><p>However, the fans didn\u2019t expect that in this show, the performance of the two people would be equal! One was cold and noble, the other was beautiful and elegant. One had an indifferent atmosphere, while the other was delicate and feminine.</p><br/><p>It was clearly two different styles but there was a strange unity.</p><br/><p>The fan circle made a careful analysis and came to a conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u300e Reach the pinnacle \u300f.</p><br/><p>There was an old saying that all roads lead to Rome. Then 360 lines going to the top\u2026 wait, this amount wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>The general meaning was that Xi Ze and Ming Yu\u2019s styles were basically different. After all, every model had their own unique temperament. But they already had the strength to reach a certain level and once they reached this state, they could exchange with each other.</p><br/><p>When these two competed on the same stage, both of them were dazzling and brilliant. It didn\u2019t feel like one side lost to the other and they were somewhat similar in one respect: they reached the pinnacle.</p><br/><p>The Ji and Ya fashion show was held in the second week of Huaxia Fashion Week. After that many second-tier, first-tier and top fashion brands held their own fashion shows. Ming Yu was invited to participate in a few top brand show as well as some first-tier shows.</p><br/><p>Many people were surprised that at this time, Ming Yu unexpected participated in the Sixin fashion show and also served as the finale model.</p><br/><p>Sixin was first-tier in the world but it was a relatively new and weaker first-tier brand.</p><br/><p>For the first-tier big names, the top 10 models in the world were difficult to get. It was because the price of these models were high and they rarely participated in a first-tier brand.</p><br/><p>Although there were more than a dozen high-end studios in the world, twenty or thirty were top brands. In such circumstances, Ming Yu unexpectedly walked in the Sixin show. This was definitely giving face to Fei Sixin but also made many people aware that the strongest newcomer seemed very human.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t a kind-hearted person in the conventional sense. But once someone was put into the \u2018friends\u2019 category, he would treat them relatively honestly.</p><br/><p>And in Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s heart, he didn\u2019t think that taking a first-tier brand\u2019s fashion show could lower his ranking. On the contrary, the supermodels worried about lowering their value with first-tier and second-tier brands weren\u2019t stable in the first place.</p><br/><p>Of course, Small Mushroom wouldn\u2019t casually agree if other first-tier brands asked him.</p><br/><p>He was called Small Mushroom and not a saint. Why would he do something that would violate his principles?</p><br/><p>The series of achievements made Ming Yu\u2019s reputation in Huaxia and in the world become higher. By the time it was August, the number of fans on Ming Yu\u2019s Muse website exceeded He Chaoman.</p><br/><p>At the end of August, the total number of fans reached a terrible 36 million!</p><br/><p>In addition to Ming Yu\u2019s strength, the surge in fans had a certain relationship with Xi Ze. The video of Ji and Ya\u2019s show and the two people\u2019s shameless interactions made a lot of fans switch to becoming CP fans.</p><br/><p>The relationship between the two people had been revealed for half a year. Those who were saddened by the situation at the beginning should\u2019ve awakened from their lovelorn grief by now. Moreover, Ming Yu and Xi Ze really matched. Even if they were depressed and wondered why they couldn\u2019t marry God Xi, once they heard someone say that Ming Yu wasn\u2019t worthy, they would immediately roll up their sleeves and take action.</p><br/><p>\u3010 If Ming Yu isn\u2019t worthy of God Xi then who is worthy? Didn\u2019t you see their videos, photos and interactions? It is a complete match! \uff08\u256c\u2594\u2594\uff09 \u3011</p><br/><p>Yes, if they didn\u2019t match well then the fans wouldn\u2019t be paralyzed by so much love. However, it was precisely because the youth chosen by their god was too good that the fans couldn\u2019t let go of their jealousy.</p><br/><p>Have you seen someone who looked as good as Ming Xiaoyu?</p><br/><p>No QAQ.</p><br/><p>Was there someone with a better figure that Ming Xiaoyu?</p><br/><p>No T^T.</p><br/><p>Was Ming Xiaoyu approachable?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t doubt that Small Mushroom could be more patient and gentle than Mr. Xi.</p><br/><p>Well, it was still a no _ (: \u0417\u201d\u2220) _.</p><br/><p>No one looked as good as him, no one had a better figure and no one had such a good temper. Other models couldn\u2019t compare to his fame and social relations. It was totally impossible!</p><br/><p>Even Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans helplessly complained: \u3010 My mushroom is good. He is so good that I feel like he isn\u2019t real\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>At this time, someone raised a point: \u3010 Don\u2019t worry. Think about how he originally made tomato scrambled eggs! Think about how mushroom practiced 800 times to be decent in acting\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e In fact, mushroom isn\u2019t a god! \u3011</p><br/><p>In this case, the fan would be hit in the face two months later.</p><br/><p>In November 2018, Xiao Biqing\u2019s new movie Midnight Singing was globally released.</p><br/><p>A story set 200 years ago about a heroine called Ye Xiangchan. On the first day of release, the box office was quite high at 30 million. After all, it was a literary movie and about a sad part of the 17 year war. Many people went to watch it for Xiao Biqing or Ming Yu, not for the movie itself.</p><br/><p>In the movie industry, the world\u2019s easiest movie to win an award was a literary movie with deep meaning!</p><br/><p>However, if the movie was hypnotizing then could it still be called a literary movie?</p><br/><p>The fans kept this in mind as they prepared drinks and snacks at the theatre, while carefully thinking about how to get through these three hours.</p><br/><p>However! To their surprise, they were attracted to the movie 10 minutes after it started!</p><br/><p>Whether it was the strong girl in the war who held her brother to escape the rain of bullets, the glamorous singer who sang in the big Shanghai hall or the thin boy who lay pale and sick in bed all day.</p><br/><p>Ye Xiangchan and Ye Yang.</p><br/><p>These two people were like roses who bloomed in the flames of war and who had been baptized with blood.</p><br/><p>They were obviously the most ordinary people but they were caught by the enemy and tortured with a terrible punishment! The traitor who betrayed them didn\u2019t fall down but these two people fell in a mess of blood.</p><br/><p>The sister was still singing when she died while the brother was still smiling when he died.</p><br/><p>There was no intact skin but their tenacious hearts were always beating!</p><br/><p><i>Thump, thump, thump!</i></p><br/><p>At the end of the movie, Ye Yang crawled to the door of the ballroom and cried after seeing the showgirl poster. These cries caused cracks in his lips to form and blood to flow.</p><br/><p>This blood invaded every inch of Huaxia\u2019s scorched earth.</p><br/><p>In these 17 years of war, countless heroes devoted their precise lives to irrigated the new world with clean water. Most of them didn\u2019t survive the 17 year war and didn\u2019t see a shadow of hope, their names disappearing into the torrents of history.</p><br/><p>Ye Xiangchan was lucky that at least her name was mentioned in the revolutionary\u2019s late memoirs.</p><br/><p>However, her brother never had his name mentioned. The only thing that the revolutionary said in his memoirs was: \u300e Xiangchan had a very beautiful little brother who looked as good as her. Her brother was very shy. He hid behind the door every day and secretly looked at me with big and bright eyes. He didn\u2019t dare speak to me. Despite being 17 years old, he only looked 14 or 15. \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e \u2026When I found her brother, I heard that he had been cut by 1,435 knives. The flesh all over his body was gone and his eyelids cut off. In the end, those eyes were still the same\u2026 \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e Very big and bright. \u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e I am sorry for many people in my life. However, I am most sorry towards Xiangchan\u2019s brother. \u300f</p><br/>\n</div>"}

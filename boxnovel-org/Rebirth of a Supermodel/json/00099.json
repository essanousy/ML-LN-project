Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c?\uff3f?\u201d Due to this expression, XI Ze was forced to measure his height\u2026</p><br/><p>Well.</p><br/><p>Later, Ming Xiaoyu said it never happened!</p><br/><p>Now, the clothing that Xi Ze pulled out was a little short compared to his height.</p><br/><p>It was a simple and elegant suit. The fabric was camel hair dyed a light black and was dotted with a starry pattern that reflected the light of the Milky Way.</p><br/><p>Camel hair was a very expensive type of high-grade fabric. Usually, only a small portion of the fluff around the camel\u2019s belly was taken, making it extremely precious. In general, soft and fluffy camel hair would be used to make haute couture coats. This time, it was actually used in a man\u2019s suit, making Ming Xiaoyu feel surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis material has been treated very well. If I don\u2019t observe it carefully, it wouldn\u2019t be obvious that it is camel hair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu carefully observed the suit while speaking. Ming Yu\u2019s surprise wasn\u2019t because this suit was made of camel hair. After all, camel hair had always been an important raw material for men\u2019s high-end shows. He was really surprised that the tailors who handled this suit was superb. They treated the fluffy nature of the camel hair, making it elegant.</p><br/><p>After a moment of careful observation, Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThis suit seems a bit small.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, the design of the suit was very good. The lines were smooth and it was more like a traditional British suit. But even if there were a thousand good things, there was one bad thing. The size of this suit was wrong!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s eyesight was good. He could tell with one glance that the person wearing this clothing was probably between 178~188cm in height. The proportions of the top and bottom were very good, showing off the tailoring. But even if the height was good enough to meet requirements, the design of the waist and hips was too strange.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze heard the youth\u2019s words and asked with a smile, \u201cHow is the size small?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu replied, \u201cThis suit, a normal man can\u2019t wear it. Is this really a men\u2019s suit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze stared at the youth for a long time before gently shaking his head. \u201cThis is women\u2019s clothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu understood with these words.</p><br/><p>Who said that a woman couldn\u2019t wear a suit? Don\u2019t you know about the popular \u2018boyfriend fans\u2019 right now?</p><br/><p>A few years ago, in the entertainment industry, there were many actresses who wore men\u2019s clothing and became \u2018national boyfriends\u2019 and \u2018national husbands.\u2019 The women showed a bold and heroic atmosphere, causing the hearts of female fans to flutter and feel confused.</p><br/><p>However, why would Xi Ze show him this woman\u2019s suit\u2026?</p><br/><p>As if aware of the youth\u2019s confusion, Xi Ze hung the suit on a hanger and explained, \u201cThis suit isn\u2019t Garcia\u2019s work. It is my design.\u201d Ming Yu looked at Xi Ze in amazement and the other said calmly, \u201cI designed this suit last year. Ji and Ya is inferior to Garcia when it comes to the production of men\u2019s clothing, so I commissioned Clucas to help me with this suit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu understood Xi Ze\u2019s explanation but he also realized something, \u201cYou designed a female suit?\u201d Ming Xiaoyu asked again, \u201cWho is this outfit for? This figure is very good, it is very beautiful and detailed. You don\u2019t like inconvenient things and she even let you tailor a suit for her. It is really rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze carefully gazed at the youth for a long time. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s lips were curved in a gentle smile, his eyebrows slightly raised. It was an indifferent appearance, without any abnormalities.</p><br/><p>However, Xi Ze\u2019s lips slowly curved and he casually replied, \u201cThis suit is designed for Chaoman.\u201d</p><br/><p>The curves of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s lips lowered for a moment before he returned to normal in the blink of an eye. He kept smiling as he asked, \u201cHe Chaoman? You really put in a lot of thought. This suit is very well designed and beautiful. He Chaoman will definitely looked good in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s dark eyes stared at the youth\u2019s face for a long time. Then Xi Ze smiled and asked, \u201cAre you jealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was stunned. \u201cJealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cYes, you are jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu spread out his hands. \u201cMr. Xi, you must design dozens or even hundreds of high-end clothing for women every year. How can I be jealous of this suit? You are really thinking too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips curved quietly. Ah, he really was jealous.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze expected this youth to have a little taste, but never thought that once this small mushroom ate vinegar, he wouldn\u2019t recover for a full three or four days!</p><br/><p>When Xi Ze talked to him, he was still normal. They would do some intimate actions and he wouldn\u2019t refuse.</p><br/><p>But there was something wrong!</p><br/><p>The small mushroom always seemed to have a hidden sword when they were talking. And when they were intimate, the small mushroom was a little absent-minded.</p><br/><p>This was Xi Ze. Someone else might\u2019ve died long ago. But Xi Ze was quite happy. He liked seeing his small mushroom be jealous.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s words weren\u2019t wrong. Every year, Xi Ze designed hundreds of high-end female clothing and even a lot of men\u2019s clothing. To be jealous of everyone, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s vinegar would be larger than the Pacific Ocean!</p><br/><p>But this time, it was really different.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu hadn\u2019t met He Chaoman once since he came to this world. He only saw her from far away in the company.</p><br/><p>He knew that she was the world\u2019s 2nd ranked female model and that she had outstanding strength. When he saw her from far away in the company, Ming Xiaoyu was aware that this female model had an elegant temperament, a beautiful appearance and a unique aura around her.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought that the reason why He Chaoman was ranked below Cecilia wasn\u2019t a matter of strength. It was only because the people of the world preferred Cecilia\u2019s clean and angelic type of temperament. This was the only place where Cecilia was better than He Chaoman.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ming Yu also knew that He Chaoman was able to rise to fame because of Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman was just starting her career when she walked in Ji and Ya\u2019s high end fashion show. After Xi Ze picked her for three consecutive fashion shows, she entered the world\u2019s female top 10 supermodel rankings and then entered the top 3 within six months.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thought of this and couldn\u2019t help feeling: \uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534!!!</p><br/><p>He was jealous! Was he not allowed to be jealous?</p><br/><p>No matter how mature, clever and deep he was, he couldn\u2019t feel good if his lover designed clothing for a woman and helped her rise to fame. Now he designed a suit specifically for her and spent half a year making it! How was this good?</p><br/><p>Who wouldn\u2019t be angry!! Ming Xiaoyu was going to die from an excess of anger!!!</p><br/><p>\u2026However, these bitter words were kept inside the small mushroom\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>He suppressed it until the night before his return to Huaxia. Clucas and his girlfriend took Xi Ze and Ming Yu out to eat, where it finally broke. It was like a punctured balloon and couldn\u2019t be stopped.</p><br/><p>At the dinner, Clucas said without much thought, \u201cAh, that suit is finished so you can take it away. When you gave me the design last year, it was really tricky. It took me a lot of effort to make and wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming XIaoyu beside him, \u201c^_^ #\u201d</p><br/><p>Clucas continued, \u201cI believe that He will certainly produce a unique result when wearing these clothes. As you said, she is the only one who can wear it. Others won\u2019t give off the right feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026==!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>That night, the handsome youth didn\u2019t act strangely. He still talked normally to Clucas, Clucas\u2019 girlfriend and even Xi Ze. On the way home, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t do anything unusual but Xi Ze felt a bit strange.</p><br/><p>However, once the two people opened the door and entered the house, Xi Ze was changing his shoes when he heard the youth snort and said, \u201cChasing after females.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Xi Ze helplessly spread his arms. \u201cI only chase my small mushroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the young man didn\u2019t even bother refuting the \u2018small mushroom\u2019. He just stared at the man.</p><br/><p>The clear moonlight shone through the windows of the living room, casting a silvery snow on the floor. The youth\u2019s clear eyes were like crystal amber at this moment, making Xi Ze sucked in. He felt his heartbeat slowly accelerating.</p><br/><p>The light was too dim, making it impossible for Xi Ze to see the youth\u2019s facial features. However, the youth\u2019s face had already been deeply imprinted in Xi Ze\u2019s heart. Even if he closed his eyes, he could describe it clearly.</p><br/><p>The two people stared at each other for a moment. Then XI Ze sighed and decided not to tease the other person any long. \u201cYou are misunderstanding. In fact, He Chaoman is my\u2026eh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth suddenly reached out and dragged the man\u2019s down.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s arms tightly embraced Xi Ze\u2019s neck, yanking his hand down and kissing the man fiercely on the lips. The kiss was too sudden and intense. Xi Ze didn\u2019t have a chance to respond as the youth sucked at his lips madly.</p><br/><p>An ambiguous sound spread in the quiet entryway. Xi Ze slowly closed his eyes and held the youth\u2019s waist, directly capturing control. He pressed the youth against the wall and kissed with all his strength.</p><br/><p>But this time, Ming Yu didn\u2019t want to follow the man\u2019s wishes. He used his strength and pressed Xi Ze against the wall instead. As Xi Ze made a surprised look, the youth stared at him with defiant eyes before once again kissing the man passionately.</p><br/><p>\u2026So active? Not bad.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was enjoying the youth\u2019s initiative when he was awakened by a pain from his lips.</p><br/><p>In the cool moonlight, the youth\u2019s white skin was glowing, his eyes were shining and his plump lips were a bright red colour. Xi Ze\u2019s heart beat faster and he was in shock from the beautiful scenery, causing him to forget the stinging feeling of his lip being bitten for a moment.</p><br/><p>At this time, the youth\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously and he sneered, \u201cXi Ze, you have to be aware of who you are.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I can\u2019t say more but I really didn\u2019t have a good first encounter with this person.</p><br/><p>The second time we met was on a late autumn night. I never thought he would appear there.</p><br/><p>Before these two incidents, I only heard Xi Ze\u2019s name on TV.</p><br/><p>We were very distant. No one thought that one day, we could actually become so close. \u300f</p><br/><p>The simple and plain text flashed on the screens of the computers and phones. These words weren\u2019t flowery or lyrical. They only told the story of the writer and his lover in a plain way, but every word tightened the hearts of the readers.</p><br/><p>\u300e Xi Ze is a very prideful person but I love him and I love his pride. He is very talented, he is very patient, he treats everything (especially his career) carefully to the extreme. I only walked in one fashion show with him but the rehearsal let me know that this man is my opponent in this life.</p><br/><p>At the same time, this man is my only love in this life.</p><br/><p>While I was with Xi Ze in London, we both got off a bus near Tower Bridge. We walked on the banks of the Thames at night and I asked Xi Ze when he would leave this circle.</p><br/><p>It is because I know him and he has to take into account many things.</p><br/><p>Now this moment has finally come. In fact, I became aware of something a few days ago. But once he decided to leave the industry, I found out along with you.</p><br/><p>The words I wrote aren\u2019t good, don\u2019t you think so? Xi Ze wrote much more beautiful words than me. He wrote very well and it is very thorough. He didn\u2019t express too much mourning and disappointment to you. However, I think that when he wrote those words, his mood was definitely much heavier than what all of us think.</p><br/><p>There is no model who doesn\u2019t love his fans.</p><br/><p>We love this industry and we also love those who are behind us and support us.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze isn\u2019t a person who is good at expressing himself. He doesn\u2019t like to show negative feelings in front of others. Even when I am with him, he always presents a powerful imagine and I have never seen his weak side.</p><br/><p>This doesn\u2019t mean that he won\u2019t feel sad or depressed.</p><br/><p>Before I post this, I have already walked to the door of the apartment. When I post it, I will have already rung the doorbell. I am waiting for him to open the door. I will go to comfort my lover and let him know that I will always stand behind him. But I think that at this moment, what he needs more is your support.</p><br/><p>I can hear his footsteps but these words can only be said here.</p><br/><p>I think the first thing I should say when I open the door is\u2014</p><br/><p>Good evening my love. \u300f</p><br/><p>This long message was posted at 19:31 on December 14th, 2019.</p><br/><p>The moment that the post was published, the netizens paying attention to Ming Yu\u2019s fan forum immediately clicked in and read it. After Ming Yu sent this post, it seemed that he really didn\u2019t pay any more attention to the movements of the Internet. Even stickying the post was left to moderators.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu often communicated with his fans at least once every two months. It was quite frequent compared to Xi Ze. The words and contents weren\u2019t necessarily enough. But there was an exchange, even if the sentence was just, \u2018Today\u2019s dinner is XX, it is very delicious.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was the first time Ming Yu published such a long post.</p><br/><p>Countless fans couldn\u2019t help getting red eyes as they read this. Finally, they couldn\u2019t help crying.</p><br/><p>It was simple letter and even the title was \u2018Untitled.\u2019 However, the love expressed it it was enough to make everyone moved!</p><br/><p>The young move wrote a love letter and he wrote a long love letter! In this love letter, he didn\u2019t talk too much about his love for his lover or to what extent his love extended. But he didn\u2019t need to say what was revealed between the lines, a love that couldn\u2019t be described in words.</p><br/><p>Many people outside the fashion industry felt that this was a really strange, luxurious and colourful world. The people here were all dressed glamorously, with many things that ordinary people couldn\u2019t have. They were far away from ordinary people and seemed difficult to touch.</p><br/><p>But in Ming Yu\u2019s love letter, all fans saw an ordinary person who cared about his lover and who wanted his lover to be recognized by the world.</p><br/><p>He was Ming Yu, he was the world\u2019s hottest model, had 40 million Muse followers and more than 100 million Weibo fans. He starred in a movie that won the Oscar\u2019s Best Adaptation award. As a cover magazine, he sold more than 2 million copies.</p><br/><p>Even so, he was just Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>When Xi Ze left the circle, countless people blessed him and hoped he would be better. However, there were many people hidden in the shadows who poured dirty water on the former king and continued to ridicule him.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Didn\u2019t Xi Ze retire because he is worried that he can\u2019t give first place next time? \u3011 The World Supermodels Organization\u2019s blessing mercilessly hit them in the first but many sunspots still continued their sarcasm. There were some Xi Ze fans who weren\u2019t fans anymore, stating that they were greatly hurt. Why did Xi Ze choose to become a designer instead of a model?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t care about these people but Ming Yu was very concerned. That\u2019s why he stated at the end of the love letter: Xi Ze needs your support. He isn\u2019t as strong as he seems on the surface. He is a human made of flesh and blood.</p><br/><p>How deep was the love that he could feel the loss hidden in the depths of his lover\u2019s heart?</p><br/><p>For a time, fans all over the world were silent. Countless Xi Ze and Ming Yu fans couldn\u2019t help crying. Some people even compared Xi Ze\u2019s announcement and Ming Yu\u2019s love letter. They found that at the end, both people were thinking about their own lover.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was worried that people would angrily besiege his lover because of his retirement, therefore he took the initiative to mention Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu took the initiative to stand up and shelter his lover from the wind and rain that were people wanting to smear him.</p><br/><p>Within one hour of Ming Yu\u2019s post, countless people left blessings on it. Many fans who weren\u2019t CP fans sincerely blessed them for their love.</p><br/><p>It was because the love between them was too sincere. Reading these simple words could make people feel the hot and thriving love.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman, Du Ruo, Luo Cheng, Cecilia, Fei Sixin, Xu Yizong, Xiao Biqing\u2026 countless people once again spoke up to support Xi Ze and Ming Yu, bringing events to the final climax. Even Adenes forwarded He Chaoman\u2019s Weibo and once again expressed her blessing for Xi Ze and Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>There was no supermodel in the world who could get such large blessings!</p><br/><p>Of course, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans said: \u3010 No, we aren\u2019t willing! Ming Yu definitely can\u2019t retire! \u3011 But Ming Yu\u2019s post wouldn\u2019t cause such a big sensation if it wasn\u2019t liked to Xi Ze. The eight year tyrant had made the name \u2018Xi Ze\u2019 really linked to the fashion world. Whether it was in the design circles or the modelling circles, he was the well-deserved leader.</p><br/><p>Thus, on the evening of Xi Ze\u2019s announcement, people around the world discussed it enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu and Xi Ze\u2019s popularity soared wildly, especially Ming Yu. His Muse fan forum added a full 10 million fans overnight!</p><br/><p>Due to his retirement, Xi Ze\u2019s fans reached a terrible 55 million but Ming Yu\u2019s fans also broke 50 million at 5 a.m. the next day. He was working hard to follow his lover and catch up with him.</p><br/><p>Under the bright moonlight, a man hugged his lover and the two people gradually fell asleep. Just like many days ago, once Ming Yu closed his eyes, Xi Ze bent over and softly kissed Ming Yu\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>But this time, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t pretend to sleep. He immediately opened his eyes and cried out, \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou aren\u2019t asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu smiled and nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m not asleep. In fact, I wasn\u2019t sleeping last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze nodded thoughtfully as his eyebrows converged together. Then he sighed and said, \u201cSince you can\u2019t sleep, it is better to do something interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>In response to Xi Ze, the youth suddenly gave him a hot kiss. The two men quickly rolled around the bed, wrinkling the blankly and almost falling off the edge of the bed.</p><br/><p>The moonlight shone in the beautiful room as ambiguous sounds were constantly head.</p><br/><p>When Ming Yu returned him, he really acted like he stated in his post and started to comfort Xi Ze. However, he only spoke for a few minutes before Xi Ze bluntly said, \u201cIf you want to comfort me, it should be with practical actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, the two shameless people no longer cared about messy things and directly moved their hands. They undressed, kissed and did other things. Now both of them were tired but they couldn\u2019t help moving again.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was just about to climax when he couldn\u2019t help shouting, \u201cHow much do you love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze laughed and bit the youth\u2019s earlobe at the moment of release, stating, \u201cI love you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to thoroughly rub his love into this body and thoroughly integrate with him. His love meant he wanted to give everything to this person and make this person the happiness person in the world.</p><br/><p>No matter how simple and shallow the love was at the beginning, it became deeply rooted after three years. It wasn\u2019t until today after sending the love letter that Ming Yu discovered he loved this man so deeply to the point of it penetrating his bone marrow.</p><br/><p>The same was true for Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>The next day, Ming Yu participated normally in a television interview program. At the same time, Xi Ze had a live broadcast about his retirement. Xi Ze also accepted some interviews and brought these events to a close.</p><br/><p>Both of them acted very calmly and fans accepted this fact.</p><br/><p>But most people didn\u2019t discover one thing. A brand that should be speaking very loudly at this time was actually silent, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until 10 days later that Ji and Ya issued another announcement on their official website.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ji and Ya will soon hire Ming Yu to be its new global spokesperson. In addition, bless our respected chief designer Xi Ze. You will always be the pillar of Ji and Ya. \u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

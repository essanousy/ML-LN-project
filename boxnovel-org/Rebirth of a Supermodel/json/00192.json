She was a big fan in Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fan circle! Goddess Xiao Xiao! Goddess Xiao Xiao might\u2019ve been forced to give the position of first leader fan to dark horse God Z, Goddess Xiao Xiao had attracted the attention of countless fans.</p><br/><p>Just Xiao Xiao Yu Yu\u2019 Weibo fans alone were nearly 40,000!</p><br/><p>Thus, in the past three minutes, this post had already been seen by a bunch of people. At the same time, some people took a screenshot and said with amazement: \u3010 Oh my god! What does Goddess Xiao Xiao mean? Why is she tired from filming? Why are her fingers broken? What is the meaning of this, ahhh!!! What does this mean!! \u3011</p><br/><p>The eyes of the masses were bright and the wisdom of the masses were endless.</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing got off the plan with a face filled with regret! Why didn\u2019t she notice that the account was \u2018Xiao Xiao Yu Yu\u2019? How could she see Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s Weibo that was forwarded by many people and subconsciously forward it?</p><br/><p>Her illustrious name was being destroyed!!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xiao Biqing seems to have hurt her finger while filming\u2026 it is Xiao Biqing! Xiao Biqing! Goddess Xiao Xiao must be Xiao Biqing ahhhhh!!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I thought that Goddess Xiao Xiao\u2019s hands were so beautiful and familiar! I actually didn\u2019t recognize the hands of my goddess Xiao, I apologize \uff3f\uff08\uff1a\u0437\u300d\u2220\uff09\uff3f\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 My family\u2019s goddess also likes Ming Xiaoyu? The goddess is in a pink fan circle with me? Wait, I am having a reaction! I will go downstairs and run five laps\u2026 \u3011 Various comments came out madly after Xiao Biqing\u2019s post. Soon the #Xiao Xiao Yu Yu# topic topped the first three search rankings and after an hour, it rose to first place!</p><br/><p>When Ming Yu first learned that Xiao Biqing had revealed her identity, he felt helpless and funny. In the end, he could only send a text message to comfort Xiao Biqing and let Zhao Rui handle PR matters.</p><br/><p>To be honest, a star liking another star was very common.</p><br/><p>Stars were also people and liked to worship other stars. Was it impossible?</p><br/><p>The problem was: Xiao Biqing was really too high profile!</p><br/><p>If Xiao Xiao Yu Yu hadn\u2019t been the top fan among Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans, if Xiao Xiao Yu Yu wasn\u2019t a famous pink fan, if Xiao Xiao Yu Yu hadn\u2019t had the big earth-shattering battle with Zyu, perhaps this matter wouldn\u2019t need PR and would naturally pass.</p><br/><p>It was precisely because of these things that Ming Yu and Xiao Biqing needed to contact the public relations department.</p><br/><p>The evening of the same day, Xiao Biqing admitted her identity and stated that she liked Small Mushroom while they were filming An Li. But she only liked him as an idol and there was no man and woman relationship between them. Ming Yu and his fans shouldn\u2019t think too much.</p><br/><p>In addition, Xiao Biqing said that she would continue to use the Xiao Xiao Yu Yu account to be an ordinary Small Mushroom fan. Please don\u2019t pay too much attention to who she was. Just know that she was Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s mushroom fan.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Biqing said this, how could anyone listen? This was the three awards winner, the top female actress with the highest value in Huaxia! Xiao Biqing actually liked Ming Xiaoyu? It was too great!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s original fans were excited. There was a huge movie queen behind him as a mushroom fan. What did this mean? This showed that the movie queen recognized Ming Yu\u2019s strength! This showed that small Mushroom wouldn\u2019t suffer too much harm from appearing on screen!</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing\u2019s looked at the relevant information regarding Ming Yu. If Xiao Biqing liked him then he was absolutely powerful. How could they not look at what type of model he was?</p><br/><p>From this point of view, the number of Ming Xiaoyu fans rose.</p><br/><p>After all, Xiao Biqing was an actress and not a model. The popularity of her sentiment towards Ming Yu was basically reflected on the major fan forums like Weibo, Baidu, etc. On Muse\u2019s official website, the number of fans didn\u2019t rise that much.</p><br/><p>However, this didn\u2019t prevent Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s Weibo fans to explode by nearly 10 million overnight, even surpassing Luo Cheng in three days!</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng soon sent a Weibo\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 Luo Cheng: Hey, the new person is forgetting the old person! Remember me on the shore of Daming Lake! @Ming Yu \u3011</p><br/><p>This seemed to be a predecessor\u2019s accusation against the younger generation but anyone could see by the joking tone that the relationship between Luo Cheng and Ming Yu was really food. As many people thought, the next day Ming Xiaoyu sent a photo of him eating with Luo Cheng. The two handsome men smiled as they looked at the screen of the photo, revealing white teeth.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Yu: @Luo Cheng said to have a meal on Daming Lake. He told me to eat with him for a week, do you agree? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I don\u2019t agree! I also want to eat a meal with my family\u2019s mushroom!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Actually, I want to invite you to have dinner together \uff3f\uff08\uff1a\u0437\u300d\u2220\uff09\uff3f \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 \u2299\ufe4f\u2299 Eat together! Yes! Add me too! I want to sign up!! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After a few incidents, the fans no longer paid attention to Xiao Biqing. However, the Xiao Xiao Yu Yu account gained a few million fans overnight and now broke through 10 million. This showed the impact of the matter on Xiao Biqing.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t a bad impact or Xiao Biqing didn\u2019t know how much she would cry.</p><br/><p>But in this case, some fans thought of one thing\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 Goddess Xiao Xiao is the account of Xiao Biqing the God X\u2026 my god, I feel like I found something unreasonable! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 No wonder why God Z said he could get the signatures of Goddess Xiao Xiao and Small Mushroom. It turned out that he already knew Goddess Xiao Xiao\u2019s identity! God Z even knows this. Who is God Z ah? \u3011</p><br/><p>This matter didn\u2019t cause too much of a splash but it entered Ming Yu\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>After finishing all the advertisements, posters, videos and other activities for the first cycle of promotions for Yizhi, Luo Ru drove the car to send Ming Yu home. Once downstairs, Ming Yu didn\u2019t get off the car as he asked softly, \u201cSister Luo, the matter I told you to investigate before, have you done it?\u201d</p><br/><p>During this time, Ming Yu had been so busy with Yizhi\u2019s endorsement work that he hadn\u2019t asked Luo Ru about the matter of investigating the Muse magazine buyers. However, now so many things added together and reminded him to pay attention to who Zyu was. Ming Yu naturally couldn\u2019t ignore it.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru wasn\u2019t flustered and answered like she was fully prepared. \u201cA week ago, I contacted a deputy editor in Muse. After knowing that you wanted to find out about the post-sales information, he gave me some clues. However, I found that the number you told me was too small. In the capital, there is a bookstore who sold 5,000 copies of the current Muse issue at once time. Another bookstore was 3,00 books and another one was 1,000. A newsstand also sold 1,000 issues at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Luo Ru was very suspicious.</p><br/><p>It was a bit strange to buy thousands of magazines at a bookstore. But actually buying 1,000 issues of a fashion magazine at a small newsstand? Do you know how thick Muse was? It was no less than 1cm!</p><br/><p>Even if the newsstand was full, it was impossible impossible to contain 1,000 issues of Muse!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince these three bookstores and newsstand bough thousands of Muse magazines, I paid special attention to them. Ming Xiaoyu.\u201d Luo Ru hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cIt isn\u2019t just this issue of Muse that they bought so much. The last time they bought so much was also the issue of Muse where you were on the cover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru stopped here and there was no need to say anymore. She knew that Ming Yu already understood her meaning.</p><br/><p>HIs eyebrows rose slightly as Ming Yu thought for a moment. \u201cHave you found out who the buyer is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t find it. The other person maintains their secrecy very well, I don\u2019t know who it is. But if I guess right, Xiao Yu, you just need to wait for the next issue of Edith where you are on the cover. I will arrange for people to watch these places and see if they can find out who bought so magazines.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru\u2019s ability was very reassuring so Ming Yu left this matter for her to deal with.</p><br/><p>His heart already had a vague shadow of an answer but Ming Xiaoyu still felt it was unlikely. His house rules were so strict, his wife actually died to defy the head of the family? Well, it was impossible. That man couldn\u2019t be a wasteful spender\u2026</p><br/><p>In fact, these thoughts were a self-consolation. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s heart really thought: Impossible, it can\u2019t be him. So many magazines, so many watches, so many perfumes, and a house! If it really was him then even if he spent his own money, Ming Yu had to break his leg!</p><br/><p>Once back home, Ming Xiaoyu opened the door and smelled the familiar fragrance of food.</p><br/><p>After dinner, Ming Yu was deeply satisfied and touched his round belly. He touched it only to suddenly realize. Didn\u2019t he have a bit of meat? As soon as this thought appeared, he stood up with horror and asked, \u201cAm I fat?\u2019</p><br/><p>The slightly stunned Xi Ze looked up from his magazine and asked, \u201cA height of 188cm and a weigh of 68kg, is that heavy?\u201d</p><br/><p>How was this heavy? In the global modelling industry, this was definitely light!</p><br/><p>But Ming Xiaoyu touched the fat at his waist (there was none) and sighed, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t be fed by you anymore. You are fattening me up! I have to exercise well after dinner or I will become a pig. What will you do then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu turned to go to the treadmill. But he had barely taken a step when he was pulled by the wrist into Xi Ze\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>The surprised Ming Yu saw this cold and handsome man smile. \u201cYou want to exercise?\u201d</p><br/><p>The startled Ming Yu gave a small nod.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze nodded meaningfully. \u201cThen let\u2019s exercise together.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, there was the beautiful harmony of the bed springs.</p><br/><p>Mr. Xi personally told a small mushroom what the best sport in the world was.</p><br/><p>Time slowly passed in this manner. The next day, the World Supermodels Organization happily published the release date of the next supermodel rankings on their official website, saying that this time they definitely won\u2019t be late. Fashion lovers, please rest assured and don\u2019t freeze their poor server again.</p><br/><p>This sentence naturally wasn\u2019t the World Supermodels Organization\u2019s original words. Their original words were: \u3010 Announcement: The world supermodel rankings will be released one week later at 8 a.m. Please wait patiently. \u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

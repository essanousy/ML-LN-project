They might often include fake news but there would also be true news. This led to many fans and the account had millions of followers.</p><br/><p>Now they posted about a small newcomer in the fashion industry so close to the Xi Ze and Ming Yu event, increasing the exposure even more. However, people quickly said that this small newcomer couldn\u2019t be Ming Yu. Ming Yu had never changed agents so it certainly wasn\u2019t him.</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t Ming Yu, the attention of the fans gradually weakened. Now the focus of the whole Internet was on Ming Yu and Xi Ze\u2019s coming out. Everyone was waiting to eat sugar and it was impossible to pay attention to some inexplicable news. In addition, this explosive news was likely to be false so there was no interest, no interest.</p><br/><p>The fans who thought that \u2018this is definitely fake news\u2019 never expected that the next day, Entertainment Industry Gossip Squad actually broke the news!!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Entertainment Industry Gossip Squad: A C surnamed supermodel entered the industry, joined M Company at the age of 15, shot for his first magazine at the age of 16, participated in several fashion shows for second and third-tier brands in the same year. However, he didn\u2019t become too big before the age of 18. At the age of 19, he relied on the resources of the younger generation and suppressed the younger generation to gradually become famous. At the age of 20, he kicked away his original agent and climbed onto a more famous agent. He has just entered the world supermodels list in the past six months. \u3011</p><br/><p>This was a bit too much!</p><br/><p>A code? This was called a code? It could be easily guessed!</p><br/><p>A Huaxia male supermodel who joined the world supermodels list in the past six months. It definitely wasn\u2019t Ming Yu. Joining M company, this was obviously a Muse model! Another calculation, surname C\u2026</p><br/><p>\u3010 Cheng Su! It is Cheng Su! He is the only Muse model and his surname starts with a C! \u3011 All of a sudden, many fans in the fashion industry were in an uproar.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s exposure was too low in the past two months, causing his fans\u2019 cohesiveness to be a bit weak. As the other netizens were speculating curiously, Cheng Su\u2019s fans couldn\u2019t react. It was only when there was a successive burst of materials from several other marketing accounts that they understood what happened.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Gossip Small Expert: Hahaha, Supermodel C has a bad reputation in the industry. All day he plays like a self-important person. But previously, he grabbed the resources of a younger generation model. If he can afford it, he will bully other newcomers. Previously, he participated in the fashion show of a second-tier brand and argued with the makeup artist. He dismissed the makeup artist for not making him handsome enough! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Entertainment 818: His oppression of Supermodel M wasn\u2019t easy, Now Supermodel M recently has black materials released and it is unknown who is behind it. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Time Entertainment News: Now this Supermodel C isn\u2019t the opponent of Supermodel M. At the beginning, he stepped on Supermodel M. Now I\u2019m afraid that in the company, who would dare act self-important with Supermodel M? Haha, he is much bigger than the C small newcomer! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At first, people were just watching casually in a lively manner. Only Cheng Su\u2019s fans were jumping in, saying that this was absolutely slander. Their Ah Cheng wasn\u2019t such a person and worked hard to order to participate in a fashion show!</p><br/><p>However, once the Supermodel M appeared, the onlookers felt that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Cheng Su\u2019s current agent is Zeng Shu. Didn\u2019t it used to be Zhao Rui? Zhao Rui is also Ming Yu\u2019s agent\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Supermodel M? Is Muse\u2019s Supermodel M my mushroom? What does this mean? Cheng Su bullied my mushroom? What does this mean?!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Cheng Su acted self-important with Ming Xiaoyu? What is going on? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>They guessed the identity of one person and then linked it to the explosive news that Entertainment Industry Gossip Squad previously released.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Cheng Su entered Muse at the age of 15 and didn\u2019t improve his career until he was 18 years old. When Ming Xiaoyu was a 14 year old Muse model, that was when Cheng Su was 18 years old! He and Cheng Su had the same agent so they must\u2019ve known each other! When Ming Xiaoyu entered the company, his resources were quite good. I used to wonder about how Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s resources became worse and worse. Was it due to Cheng Su? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 It really is the case!

I have seen some of his catwalk videos before. His appearance and body are okay, but his aura is too small! In fact, it was really hopeless that he only entered the world supermodels list six or seven years after debuting. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Age: 18 years old and 22 years old. Debut time: 4 years and 7 years. World ranking: 16 and nothing. Number of endorsements\u2026 Cheng Su dares bully my family\u2019s Ming Xiaoyu? My Ming Xiaoyu will completely beat up up! Beating up Cheng Su is no problem! How are he bully Ming Xiaoyu? \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The marketing accounts continued to expose Cheng Su\u2019s black materials. The Supermodel C code was still used but they started to talk about related events in detail. For example, in a reality show, Supermodel C deliberately bullied Supermodel M, making Supermodel M continuously receive punishment.</p><br/><p>This type of thing wasn\u2019t a big deal. At the beginning, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s popularity wasn\u2019t that high and Zeng Shu\u2019s PR ability was relatively strong. He completely crushed the incident. Now it was once again exposed to the sun, making the fans furious!</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s current total number of fans on the Muse fan forum wasn\u2019t even half of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s.</p><br/><p>After this, many incidents were small models apart from Ming Yu were bullied by Cheng Su was exposed, all under abbreviations. These abbreviations weren\u2019t a code at all. Everyone sharp knew who was bullied by Cheng Su in the end!</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve ended with just this. After all, it only came from the marketing accounts and the fans weren\u2019t willing to bow their heads. But after a few hours, a small third-tier model actually stood up and stated that he wasn\u2019t afraid of Cheng Su. He was bullied so miserably by Cheng Su that he must come out and speak!</p><br/><p>Once the first person emerged, he was followed by a small star, a makeup artist, a small assistant\u2026</p><br/><p>More and more people came out to agree with the news from the marketing accounts, stating that it was true.</p><br/><p>In just 12 hours, many Muse members unfollowed Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>Originally, the number of fans was about to break through 10 million. Now it was reduced to 6 million.</p><br/><p>The trend of fans leaving wasn\u2019t weakened and the number was continuing to decrease!</p><br/><p>Despite the marketing account and the complaints of people involved, some of the brainless Cheng Su fans still insisted that \u2018My Ah Cheng worked very hard, can\u2019t you see his efforts?\u2019, \u2018My Ah Cheng walked hard to reach this status. He paid with sweat and tears, can\u2019t you see it?\u2019 and other similar words.</p><br/><p>This type of brainless speech was really lethal. They said that their idol worked hard when the results were obtained from others!</p><br/><p>How could his hard world be compared?</p><br/><p>The famous hard work Lin Xi in the entertainment industry, could Cheng Su compare to him?</p><br/><p>Could he compare to the famous labour model in the fashion industry?</p><br/><p>There were 365 days in a year and this person worked 350 days! Works emerged in an endless stream. Do you think that these words were made while lying in bed and appeared out of nowhere? This was the sweat that other people paid!</p><br/><p>Then what about Cheng Su? He seemed to rest practically every day. Was this called effort?</p><br/><p>Fans were stunned by the villain who bullied newcomers, making Cheng Su\u2019s reputation stink.

The fashion and entertainment industry needs to reject such cancer! \u3011</p><br/><p>These words summed up Cheng Su\u2019s shameful acts.</p><br/><p>No one thought that Huaxia Daily, one of the most traditional Huaxia magazines would unexpectedly write a serious summary of the Cheng Su incident and call him a cancer of the fashion industry.</p><br/><p>The title of \u2018cancer\u2019 was too big. The netizens laughed speechlessly while the fans had nothing to say.</p><br/><p>Did they want to refute it? While some people blushed and shut up at the \u2018cancer\u2019 title, other people opened their mouths and said, \u2018Don\u2019t call him cancer. At least our family\u2019s Ah Cheng doesn\u2019t do drugs.\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>At first, everyone just used the word \u2018cancer\u2019 and \u2018drug addict\u2019 to ridicule the bad behaviour of Cheng Su\u2019s fans. They never imagined that the next day, explosive news would appear on the front page of Huaxia Daily.</p><br/><p>[Supermodel C has reportedly been abusing drugs.

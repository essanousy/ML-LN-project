Some of the more intelligence bookstore owners and newsstand bosses put this edition of Edith in the most eye-catching position, letting the people passing by see it.</p><br/><p>Edith was one of the top five fashion magazines in the world. Although its influence in Huaxia wasn\u2019t as good as the local magazines Muse and Suyi, it always had good sales. And these bosses had long discovered that the cover of this issue of Edith was Ming Yu, who had recently been on fire!</p><br/><p>As long as there was a magazine of Ming Yu, sales would shoot up! Shouldn\u2019t it quickly sell out?</p><br/><p>The bosses weren\u2019t disappointed this time. At noon, this issue of Edit was sold out, making the savvy bosses hate themselves. Edith was an American magazine and the sales in Huaxia weren\u2019t that great, making them order fewer copies.</p><br/><p>The Ming Xiaoyu fans who had been looking forward to this month\u2019s Edith found a cold and indifferent youth on the cover. This was a style that Ming Yu rarely tried. He was very elegant in a gentleman\u2019s tuxedo as he half leaned against the wall, looking at the world outside the photo.</p><br/><p>Perhaps because Edith was a Western magazine, this time Ming Yu\u2019s outfit was a full European style.</p><br/><p>His soft hair was dyed a brilliant golden yellow. It wasn\u2019t the vulgar gold of the country but was the same as the Western blonds, a soft and delicate platinum gold. The hair was deliberately cut short. Many long-haired Ming Yu fans thought it was a pity but this short and capable hair made the youth look more mature and restrained.</p><br/><p>The platinum gold hair was styled back, leaving only a few strands of hair over the forehead, making the smooth forehead look fuller.</p><br/><p>It might be a tuxedo but it wasn\u2019t as strict as the traditional ones. The youth was leaning against the wall with one foot. The outfit was casually open and the shirt had a few buttons loosened, revealing the bulge of the collarbone.</p><br/><p>Bright light hit his right side from the left side of the photo, making the shadow of the young man stretch out on the ground.</p><br/><p>This scene was too fresh and beautiful. Such a youth was too gentle and elegant, capturing the group of excited mushroom fans. It also made many passersby fans feel \u201cWhat type of style can Ming Yu not control?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, there were no big changes. Three bookstores and a newspaper stand in the capital sold thousands of copies of Edith to a regular person. This little assistant was very diligent. After gathering all the magazines, he contacted a truck that specifically transported the 10,000 magazines to a high-end villa area.</p><br/><p>The assistant didn\u2019t notice that after they left the bookstore/newsstand, a few detective-like people walked out and started to call someone.</p><br/><p>After receiving these calls, Luo Ru immediately left Ming Yu\u2019s lounge and headed downstairs to Muse\u2019s actor training department. She found Ming Xiaoyu discussing a few things with Brother Yuan.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the truth was completely revealed.</p><br/><p>The afternoon of the same day, just one hour after the previous event occurred, the well-recognized gold medal agent Ding Bo rushed with fright into the Ji and Ya studio. He scurried to the private studio at the top and cried out, \u201cI was wrong! It is a fake identity! I found out!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Ding Bo opened the door, Xi Ze was pouring wine. As a designer, Xi Ze would often borrow the power of alcohol if he couldn\u2019t find inspiration. It could be red wine, champagne or even white wine and yellow rice wine.</p><br/><p>When he heard Ding Bo\u2019s voice, Xi Ze was very calm. He didn\u2019t even raise his eyes as he stated, \u201cYou just slammed open my door and hit it against the plant next to it. With your dirty shoes, you stepped on my rug.\u201d</p><br/><p>The urgent Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Ding Bo cried out angrily, \u201cMy god! You only think about your door, your plant, your rug! Anyway, it is your business and has nothing to do with me. If you don\u2019t want to know then forget it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s heart tightened at the words and he asked, \u201cWhat matter is related to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze subconsciously thought about the true identity of I want to break my wife\u2019s leg that Ding Bo had checked a few days ago. But this matter was already determined. Ding Bo found the membership registration information on Muse\u2019s official website and the user was just an ordinary person in the capital. His life was quite innocent and there wasn\u2019t anything important.</p><br/><p>But once he saw Ding Bo\u2019s \u2018You hurt me, I won\u2019t tell you\u2019 expression, Xi Ze\u2019s eyelids once again twitched as a familiar, ominous feeling rushed into his heart.</p><br/><p>His grip on the glass tightened as Xi Ze asked calmly, \u201cIs it related to that netizen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo sneered and didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThis door was airlifted from France and the value is 200,000\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is Ming Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Bang</i>\u2014</p><br/><p>To Ding Bo\u2019s fright, he saw Xi Ze\u2019s eyes widen and the glass in his hand unexpectedly crashed to the ground! For this type of thing to happen to Xi Ze, it was a real eye-opener for Ding Bo. After three minutes of feeling stunned, he laughed and laughed.</p><br/><p>The light-coloured champagne instantly soaked the white wool rug. The expensive wool rug that was flown from Italy became dyed by the champagne, causing Ding Bo to laugh.</p><br/><p>But the laughing Ding Bo couldn\u2019t laugh anymore.</p><br/><p>He saw Xi Ze narrow his eyes while placing the bottle in his other hand onto the table. Then he asked in a dignified tone, \u201cWhy is it Ming Yu? Didn\u2019t you already investigate the identity of the other person?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this reminder, Ding Bo realized that he had made a mistake in his work!</p><br/><p>Sweat suddenly flowed down and Ding Bo gulped before explaining, \u201cWhen I checked that small netizen, I felt a bit strange. That person is more than 30 years old this year and is relatively simple. He doesn\u2019t seem like a fashion lover. After this thing passed, I still felt that something was wrong. I used a few means to check the identity of the person and discovered\u2026 He is the grandson of Zhao Rui\u2019s second eldest aunt\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u2026\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo swallowed the saliva in his mouth again and carefully asked, \u201cThat\u2026 Xi Ze, can I leave first? I have something to do in Muse and you need to do work for Ji and Ya. I\u2019ll go first\u2026go\u2026QAQ!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s ruthless eyes stared at Ding Bo. Ding Bo didn\u2019t doubt that if eyes could kill, Ding Bo would be dead countless times.</p><br/><p>Under such a powerful and terrible sight, Ding Bo found that his legs were really weak and he could only listen as Xi Ze asked, \u201cToday is when Edith is released You\u2026\u201d Xi Ze paused and gritted his teeth. \u201cDid you buy the magazines?\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone seemed calm but Ding Bo had known him for many years. He was keenly away that there was a slight tremor in Xi Ze\u2019s voice, as if he was suppressing something.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was a bit timid. He might not understand why it mattered if \u2018I want to break my wife\u2019s leg\u2019 was Ming Yu. What did this have to do with Xi Ze? At most, Ming Yu learnt about Xiao Biqing and opened a side account to enter his own fan circle\u2026</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>I want to break my wife\u2019s leg?!!!</p><br/><p>Who was Ming Yu\u2019s wife?!</p><br/><p>This question would cost him his life.</p><br/><p>But Ding Bo knew! Xi Ze\u2019s wife was Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>Then if Ming Yu wanted to break his wife\u2019s legs\u2026</p><br/><p>He thought of the other words from this \u2018break the legs\u2019 comrade: I have a wife who is a wasteful spend\u2026 oh my god! This was self-evident!</p><br/><p>Ding Bo trembled as he quietly whispered, \u201c\u2026This morning, Xiao Zhang was very responsible. He bought 10,000 magazines and took it to the original place\u2026 the villa.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Boom!</i></p><br/><p>Mr. Xi\u2019s entire face was dark.</p><br/><p>That evening, Mr. Xi who had always been committed to \u2018going home early and holding his wife to sleep\u2019 spent a long time in the Ji and Ya studio. Eventually, he received a text message from his mushroom asking why he wasn\u2019t home and he very reluctantly drove home.</p><br/><p>The always clogged traffic in the capital, why wasn\u2019t it clogged today for Mr. Xi? Unexpectedly, he arrived home in 20 minutes and stood at the doorstep, not daring to knock on the door.</p><br/><p>For 10 minutes, there was a battle in his heart between heaven and man!</p><br/><p>Mr. Xi gritted his teeth, his face calm as he entered the password lock and opened the door.</p><br/><p>Pushing open the door\u2014Eh? The lights weren\u2019t turned on?</p><br/><p>Go forward\u2014</p><br/><p><i>Flip. </i>The entire living room lit up instantly!</p><br/><p>A handsome young man calmly sat on the soft lambskin sofa and looked up at the man standing at the entrance. As soon as he looked up, he said with a smile, \u201cMr. Zyu, do you like perfume or do you like watches? Or do you like 10,000 magazines?\u201d</p><br/><p>Placed in front of the youth were:</p><ol><li>Nidelan\u2019s Smoke fragrance.</li><li>Feilu\u2019s Rongyao series of watches.</li><li>The new issue of Edith!</li></ol><br/>\n</div>"}

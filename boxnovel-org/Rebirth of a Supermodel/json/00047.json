After that, Ming Yu never saw Lu Zhenxi. It was said that he was participating in a small foreign fashion show and wasn\u2019t in the capital.</p><br/><p>The seven day break, Ming Yu didn\u2019t completely spend it in the training class. The first five days, he was very diligent in class, hoping to gain the theoretical knowledge and practice to improve himself. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Things didn\u2019t go as he wished.</p><br/><p>Before seeing Ming Yu, Yuan Qingsheng (Brother Yuan) never though there would be someone with such bad acting in the world!</p><br/><p>Confucius once said that rotten wood couldn\u2019t be carved. Yuan Qingsheng always believed that although rotten wood couldn\u2019t be carved, but couldn\u2019t it be turned into a small decoration?</p><br/><p>However, if people talked about rotten wood then Xiaoyu was the dregs!</p><br/><p>The script on the first day was already very simple. Ming Yu failed to show very much and Brother Yuan could understand it. After all, Lu Zhenxi didn\u2019t rehearse with Ming Yu and Ming Yu didn\u2019t have acting experience. At least\u2026Ming Yu got the lines right!</p><br/><p>\u2014In order to find something positive to say, half of Brother Yuan\u2019s brain cells died.</p><br/><p>But the next day, Brother Yuan continued with a simple script for everyone to perform. Ming Yu\u2019s performance with A\u2019Zhao, it made Brother Yuan\u2026 this was too crazy!</p><br/><p>Good grief, how could he perform in such a murderous way! An expression of joy made them feel like crying!</p><br/><p>Where was the acting?</p><br/><p>The thing that everyone found fault with?</p><br/><p>\u2014Look, what was the difference between the performance and the emotions described in the script?</p><br/><p>\u2014Oh, everything is different except for the lines?</p><br/><p>\u2014Congratulations, you got it!</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan: Who would want to answer this type of thing! \uff08\u256c\u2594\u2594\uff09!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s acting really didn\u2019t have any hope. That afternoon, Brother Yu gave Ming Yu special treatment and gave a careful explanation for Ming Yu\u2019s performances in the past two days.</p><br/><p>He tried to explain \u2018what is acting\u2019 in his own way and Ming Xiaoyu listened carefully. Upon seeing this, Brother Yuan thought, \u2018Since your acting is bad, let\u2019s start from scratch! First, you have to understand that acting is different from the catwalk. You want to perform the emotions of others, using a variety of lines, expressions and tricks to show the emotional state.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu listened carefully and recorded all the main points in a small notebook. Brother Yuan saw this and nodded with satisfaction. Then he took a look at the writing and\u2026 almost fainted!</p><br/><p>What was this word?</p><br/><p>What exactly was the word?</p><br/><p>It was a dog-like font! I\u2019m not asking you to write like a god or dragon, can\u2019t you at least write block letters!</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan looked sympathetically at Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s notes, then he looked at the exquisite face and the dog-like writing. In the end, Brother Yuan sighed and secretly thought, \u2018Forget it, it is good that he is writing things down. Ming Xiaoyu is really serious about studying, he will improve!\u2019</p><br/><p>However, the next day, Brother Yuan was mercilessly smashed by his naive thoughts\u2026</p><br/><p>In order to take care of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s acting, Brother Yuan deliberately took out the simplest (Brother Yuan thought so) and let everyone try acting it. He didn\u2019t draw lots, directly arranging for Ming Yu and A\u2019Xue to act together.</p><br/><p>A\u2019Xue was a girl, wouldn\u2019t a man and woman work well together?</p><br/><p>Then he let A\u2019Zhao and Old Chen demonstrate first. Surely Ming Yu would learn something from it? Brother Yuan believed that Ming Xiaoyu could at least imitate it. If he showed even a little bit of A\u2019Zhao\u2019s performance from the imitation then Brother Yuan would believe that there was true love in the world.</p><br/><p>However, if Ming Xiaoyu allowed Brother Yuan to so easily believe in love, he wouldn\u2019t be called Ming Xiaoyu. \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d After the performance was over, A\u2019Xue, A\u2019Zhao and Old Chen\u2019s expressions were like this: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And Brother Yuan was the scariest. He was directly like this: \u201co\uff08*\u2267\u25bd\u2266\uff09\u30c4\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t doubt it, it really was \u201co\uff08*\u2267\u25bd\u2266\uff09\u30c4\u201d. Anyways\u2026 this mood was like drinking a medicinal soup before the final party.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was a storm of emotions in Brother Yuan and he felt like collapsing. He quickly formulated a series of strategies and decided to specifically teach Ming Yu separately.</p><br/><p>After all, the director had cautioned him to take care of Ming Yu, so Brother Yuan would naturally take good care of him. It definitely wasn\u2019t possible to be the best actor. He might not have normal acting skills, but if he was going to be just a pretty vase, he would be the best pretty face!</p><br/><p>With this mentality, Brother Yuan painstakingly prepared thick learning materials for Ming Yu. The reference books including \u2018An Actor\u2019s Self-Learning\u2019, \u2018Film and Television Performance Language Skills\u2019, \u2018Psychology of a Performance\u2019 and so on.</p><br/><p>At the beginning of the separate training, Brother Yuan was still confident. However, as time passed, this ambition helplessly collapsed.</p><br/><p>On the fifth day, Brother Yuan handed Ming Yu a large number of books and CDs and sighed. \u201cMing Xiaoyu, I think I have nothing to teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was dazed by the words and blankly looked at the pale Brother Yuan.</p><br/><p>\u2018There is nothing I can teach you anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>These words usually appeared in two scenarios: First, the teacher couldn\u2019t teach the student because the student had gone beyond the teacher\u2019s level. Secondly, the teacher had no idea how to teach the student. The student was too helpless.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu knew that it was absolutely impossible to be the first scenario so\u2026</p><br/><p>It was the second one.</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan gave a long sigh and continued, \u201cLast night, I organized some notes and reference books for you. I also think it is worth learning from classic acting clips. I\u2019ve copied them onto a CD for you, so you can always watch them and learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Brother Yuan paused and looked at the lonely and silent boy in front of him. Then he suddenly laughed. \u201cIn fact, after teaching you these past few times, I can probably guess why you can\u2019t act.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at Brother Yuan with startled eyes.</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan smiled and explained, \u201cIt is because you can\u2019t act as other people. When you are acting, you really do try to figure out the other person\u2019s psychology and study what they would do. However, you forget to bring the person into yourself. You are a bystander and use the most objective point of view to observe the behaviour of the character. You don\u2019t let yourself become the character. In fact, you aren\u2019t bad. Models don\u2019t have to enter the entertainment industry. You can occasionally guest in some TV series and movies. But to break through this barrier, Ming Yu, you can only rely on yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu might be confident, but not to the point of blindness. He also knew that his acting was bad. Yet Brother Yuan still helped him organize notes and CDs, Ming Yu was really grateful.</p><br/><p>Thus, on the fifth day of the training course, Ming Yu packed up his things and decided to leave.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, he solemnly looked at Brother Yuan. He thought about the notes organized for him and spoke words of thanks. \u201cBrother Yuan, these days I\u2019ve really learned a lot. I also got to meet everyone. I am very happy to meet all these friends, regardless of my future acting abilities. I am very thankful that you let me have a happy break.\u201d</p><br/><p>That evening, Ming Yu invited Brother Yuan and the others to dinner. Of course, it was impossible to pick a place like Ruoshang Hall. But Ming Yu took them to one of his favourite resturants.</p><br/><p>The five days of friendship between the students and teacher, the students were also touched by Ming Yu. All of them ate a lot.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wanted to have a good rest for the last two days of his break, but a message from Zhao Rui made him come to life again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that Cheng Su win the global endorsement for \u2018Rayleigh Cano?\u2019 It is impossible! He might be a popular domestic first-tier model, but this is a global endorsement! Rayleigh Cano is also a famous second-tier brand. How can that kid Cheng Su endorse it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, this morning, Cheng Su\u2019s Muse website released this news: Cheng Su has been hired as the global spokesperson for the second-tier British luxury brand \u2018Rayleigh Cano.\u2019</p><br/><p>Shortly after the announcement, various media in the country also published their relevant articles. After a while, the global newspapers like Global Times and the Sun also published the relevant information. This proved that Cheng Su had actually become the spokesperson for Rayleigh Cano.</p><br/><p>Rayleigh Cano was an internationally renowned luxury brand, regarded as second-tier. In previous years, its global spokesperson were famous celebrities or top supermodels. The previous year\u2019s Eston was the world\u2019 87th ranked male supermodel, and before that, it was Ono Yuichi, a famous celebrity.</p><br/><p>This was the first time that Rayleigh Cano invited a first-tier male model as its global spokesperson!</p><br/><p>After learning the news, Zhao Rui was very angry but he gradually started to realize his incompetence. The fact that Cheng Su won this endorsement meant that the brand recognized his strength. Even if Zeng Shu used tricks, it would be hard without a brick foundation.</p><br/><p>Under Zhao Rui, Cheng Su was just a popular male model. His best endorsement was just a second-tier brand and it was in the separate field of watches.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui once again started reflecting. However, Ming Yu just smiled meaningfully at the words. He remembered that Zeng Shu said he just returned to Huaxia after winning a big second-tier endorsement overseas.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 this was it?</p><br/><p>A long-lost fighting spirit filled his chest. After reading the last wrods of the announcement, Ming Yu put down the table PC and turned to the still thinking Zhao Rui. He asked, \u201cBrother Zhao, has tomorrow\u2019s itinerary been arranged?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui and Luo Ru were surprised for a moment at hte words.</p><br/><p>After a long while, Zhao Rui suddenly remembered, \u201cYes! Tomorrow, we have arranged for contact with people from \u2018Nidelan\u2019 to prepare a set of posters, a series of photos and some large publicity photos. As for the film and television advertisements, they are still being prepared and the time isn\u2019t set yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui became more emboldened.</p><br/><p>In his eyes, the youth had a mature and confident smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was walking fast?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu would be faster than this man!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was a world-class supermodel. Who would care about one or two sentences criticizing his poor acting? However, the sentence \u2018very big background\u2019 made many of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s sunspots move.</p><br/><p>\u3010 A back door, I said it! How can he get this status so quickly if he has no background? \u3011 \u3010 Hahaha, I really don\u2019t know what Ming Yu\u2019s background is. You all say that Ming Xiaoyu looks good, I don\u2019t\u2026 hehe \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I just say the An Li stills. Ming Yu\u2019s character is extremely effeminate! I can only think of the word effeminate! With these looks, who knows where he came from? Isn\u2019t it written on his information that Ming Yu is an orphan. Having a family background is definitely impossible. Then what is his background\u2026 \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s original words could only slightly damage Ming Yu\u2019s image in the entertainment industry and had no big impact on him. But a matter like his background was a problem that man fans were concerned about.</p><br/><p>If the idol you have always liked go where he was not through his own efforts, but through a back door or even the unspoken rules, how would you feel?</p><br/><p>Some passersby fans starts to shake. After all, if they thought about it, Ming Yu\u2019s development was too smooth.</p><br/><p>During the incident with Fashion Entertainment, Ming Yu was only a third-tier model but the second-tier magazine had to apologize to him. Later, it was smooth sailing as he was able to get good endorsements and good fashion shows. Whenever there was a storm, he could be saved from it and even benefited from it.</p><br/><p>Were these things really because Ming Yu was very powerful?</p><br/><p>However, most of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans didn\u2019t care about Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s \u2018background theory.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u3010 Every time Mushroom is on the catwalk, his strength has been recognized by the world\u2019s major media. His appeal in every endorsement is obvious to everyone. Now you want to rely on a sentence to deny Mushroom\u2019s achievements? You are dreaming! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 It has been more than half a year and you still come out to bit. Go back and have a good rest. We no longer care about you. Ming Xiaoyu risked his life trying to save you. You white-eyed wolf don\u2019t know how to have a good heart and returned his \u2018grace\u2019 like this, acting as if Ming Xiaoyu hurt you! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I only believe in my own eyes. I feel that every performance of Ming Yu\u2019s is very amazing. That\u2019s why I like him! If he really relied on his background then why? Why didn\u2019t he rely on his background to debut? Why? He crawled from a second-tier magazine to his current position. \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The words of the netizens combined with the intervention of Muse\u2019s PR department had control of this matter.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for today\u2019s Ming Yu to succumb purely to Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s words. Not to mention, he couldn\u2019t produce any evidence.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Rui told Ming Yu about this type of thing, he didn\u2019t care very much. \u201cDidn\u2019t CX Entertainment say that they blocked him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui thought for a moment before saying, \u201cShen Xiang contacted the people at CX Entertainment. They said that they called Jiang Kaiyang but he never picked up. In addition, the side account isn\u2019t certified. Jiang Kaiyang might be their artist but they have no means to limit the freedom of the \u2018individual\u2019 Jiang Kaiyang. Therefore, they have sent an agent to Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s home to see the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s brow tightened and he thought for a moment. Then he asked, \u201cIs it confirmed that the side account is actually Jiang Kaiyang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was slightly stunned when he heard this. After a while, he said, \u201cI will check.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t pay attention to what happened next. It was because he believed that Jiang Kaiyang was selfish but he wouldn\u2019t be able to make any big waves.</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang had no evidence that Ming Yu was in a relationship with Xi Ze. Even if he did, he wouldn\u2019t dare publish it. After all, don\u2019t talk about Xi Ze, even today\u2019s Ming Yu couldn\u2019t be provoked.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Ming Xiaoyu never imagined that on the second day, Jiang Kaiyang acted like a fish swimming to his death as he published\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 I am Jiang Kaiyang: Can I get out of the entertainment industry? Can\u2019t I get out on my own? I have been blocked by Ming Yu\u2019s background and will leave on my own! Ming Yu, remember that I have a clear conscience. I\u2019m not afraid of you Ming Yu, I am afraid of the person behind you! \u3011</p><br/><p>Once they saw this, Luo Ru carefully avoided the people around them and asked Ming Yu, \u201cXiaoyu, this matter\u2026 should Mr. Xi intervene?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t needed this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>This level of pouring dirty water was too good!</p><br/><p>The fans didn\u2019t think a star would make a joke about their future, threatening that other people have blocked them. They didn\u2019t know that Xi Ze had nothing to do with Jiang Kaiyang being banned. His friend, the president of CX Entertainment took the initiative to block Jiang Kaiyang. This matter had nothing to do with Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>However, a star already used his own future to make a guarantee, this was equivalent to an ancient death. Regardless of whether Ming Xiaoyu had a background or not, Jiang Kaiyang couldn\u2019t be mixed up in the entertainment industry anymore because he offended a group of people who really did have a background.</p><br/><p>More and more people started to question whether Jiang Kaiyang was telling the truth.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s fans still didn\u2019t wave but this type of assessment had a certain impact on Ming Yu\u2019s reputation. The new world supermodel rankings would soon be released and Ming Yu would become Yizhi\u2019s global spokesperson. Under these circumstances, his reputation couldn\u2019t be destroyed.</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu heard from Zhao Rui that \u2018I am Jiang Kaiyang\u2019 was really opened by Jiang Kaiyang and those Weibo messages posted by him, Ming Yu silently thought for a long time.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t think he was a good person. Jiang Kaiyang said he had a background and it was true that Xi Ze could barely be counted as his background, but this background was rejected by Ming Yu when it first appeared.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze could only be regarded as an auxiliary role to Ming Yu getting this far. It could be said that even without Xi Ze, Ming Yu believed in his own strength and he could solve the obstacles that appeared in front of him again and again.</p><br/><p>For example, Zhu Wei at the beginning had nothing to do with Xi Ze, For example, later with Mudley and Andrew, it might cost him a bit more with Xi Ze but Ming Xiaoyu could direct public opinion in the way he wanted.</p><br/><p>As for Ming Yu\u2019s MV, endorsements and fashion shows, they all had no relationship with Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Shen Xiang previously go to Xi Ze in the hope that he would open a back door for his lover, only to unexpectedly be rejected?</p><br/><p>There was a saying that Ming Yu always said, but it had never been wrong. [If you are a gold master, you are the world\u2019s most unqualified gold master!]</p><br/><p>In the end, the trend on the Internet became increasingly worse. If this continued, even Ming Yu\u2019s reputation would be affected. Muse\u2019s PR suppressed the media but Ming Yu decided that some things should be settled.</p><br/><p>The second evening after Jiang Kaiyang started talking, a media outlet released a set of exposure photos.</p><br/><p>There were more than 20! Each one was dimly lit but they had a familiar face!</p><br/><p>In these photos, Jiang Kaiyang slept very well while the middle-aged woman lying beside him was taking a selfie.</p><br/><p>It was a selfie and the media put mosaics over the faces of these women. This didn\u2019t prevent people from recognized that these women were at least 50 or 60 years old based on the wrinkles on their necks and arms!</p><br/><p>And in these photos, there were those exposing Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s lower body!</p><br/><p>The mosaic blocked specific parts and the photos were taken sneakily while Jiang Kaiyang was sleeping. But this couldn\u2019t hide the fact that Jiang Kaiyang slept with a group of old women!</p><br/><p>A young and handsome small star in the entertainment industry unexpectedly slept with a group of old women like this?</p><br/><p>You could say that Jiang Kaiyang had a unique hobby and liked an old woman. Even if no one believed these words, it could cover the past. But! In these photos, the women had short hair, long hair, one had a birthmark on her shoulder while another had a mole on her neck.</p><br/><p>They obviously weren\u2019t the same person!</p><br/><p>Based on these photos, there were at least three or four people!</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang liked three or four old women? Who was he trying to fool?</p><br/><p>This handsome new star would only go to bed with so many old women for one reason. It was self-evident\u2026</p><br/><p>Now everyone understood who went through the back door! Who did the unspoken rules!</p><br/><p>Now no one sympathized with this once handsome new star. The fans who no longer resented him became so angry that they all turned black, or those who had already turned black couldn\u2019t wait to smash his corpse to comfort themselves over the fact that they once liked this person!</p><br/><p>While they were trying to support him, he was accepting the unspoken rules by going to bed with old women. When they paid for the snacks he endorsed, he was accepting the unspoken rules by going to bed with old women!</p><br/><p>This type of blow was really too big!</p><br/><p>After an hour, Jiang Kaiyang once again cancelled his account.</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t stop Jiang Kaiyang from being completely banned in the entertainment industry.</p><br/><p>This was no longer a company ban but a ruthless ban by fans.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was shooting an advertisement video when he was informed of this fact. However, he didn\u2019t react much. These photos were taken by Ming Yu from Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s phone. The Apple phones would delete photos every 100 days or so. Jiang Kaiyang clearly didn\u2019t find these photos in the \u2018recently deleted\u2019 folder.</p><br/><p>In those 100 days, Jiang Kaiyang went to bed with at least three or four rich people. Ming Xiaoyu knew when he thought about it. Jiang Kaiyang was trying to get the second male lead of An Li by accepting the unspoken rules.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu originally didn\u2019t intend to publish these photos. Keeping the photos was just preparing a path for himself. As long as Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s path never crossed his, he would forget about it.</p><br/><p>Now Jiang Kaiyang came out to cause chaos during the rise of Ming Yu\u2019s career. Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t the type of person to complain about morality. He was a person who returned one drop of water with a gushing spring, but one arrow had to be repaid 10 times.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu continued his advertisement shoot without paying attention to this person\u2019s business anymore.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the capital, in a dimly lit apartment, a pale man looked at the trash and food residue in silence for a long time. In the end, he started laughing and crying, like his spirit had been a bit broken.</p><br/><p>After crying for 10 minutes, Jiang Kaiyang wiped his swollen eyes and made a call.</p><br/><p>The man on the phone seemed to be very anxious. Jiang Kaiyang opened his mouth and said, \u201cCheng Su, I did it but you saw the result. These photos have completely ruined my future. The price of 10 million isn\u2019t enough. I want 20 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person on the other end of the phone didn\u2019t think that Jiang Kaiyang would have such a big opening. He swore and said a few words.</p><br/><p>But Jiang Kaiyang just sneered very calmly. \u201cWhen you found me, you knew that no matter how this matter turned out, I wouldn\u2019t be able to mix in Huaxia anymore. Originally, this 10 million that you gave me would let me go abroad for a few decades. Now my ugly photos are exposed and my reputation completely ruined. I might even have a bad time abroad. Don\u2019t you need to take responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that these photos are my own responsibility. If I hadn\u2019t helped you try to smash Ming Yu, would I have ended up like this? 20 million! Please the 5 million you gave me before as a down payment! 25 million yuan for my silence, it is a bargain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have that much money? It isn\u2019t any of my business. Let me tell you, I recorded our previous conversation when you negotiated with me. If you don\u2019t pay me then I will publish the recording! I am difference from you. I have been blocked for half a year and now I\u2019m ruined. What about you? You are still on the rise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you are thinking about it. I will give you three days. 25 million in that time and you will never see me again!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After all, he was a supermodel. After participating in a variety show, he was ready to shoot a next-generation endorsement.</p><br/><p>However, the day before Cheng Su was ready, Zeng Shu directly told him that there was no need to go.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was shocked!</p><br/><p>This was a good endorsement for men\u2019s cigarettes. The current domestic cigarette ads were slightly concealed but the investment publicity costs for high-end cigarettes wasn\u2019t low. The cigarettes that Cheng Su was going to endorse was the world\u2019s top cigarette brand. Zeng Shu put a lot of effort in to help Cheng Su get this endorsement.</p><br/><p>How was the trip suddenly cancelled the day before he was going to meet with the endorsement brand?</p><br/><p>Cheng Su went to Zeng Shu to understand the situation. After learning the specific news, he was stunned. A long time passed before he dared asked, \u201cBrother Zeng! We have previously signed an oral agreement. A written agreement was supposed to be signed today. How can they suddenly break the contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu stared meaningfully at Cheng Su for a long time before speaking unknown words, \u201cI also want to know what you did to get the current result.\u201d Then he turned away without mercy.</p><br/><p>This cigarette endorsement was just the start. For the next month, Cheng Su experienced a terrible empty window period for the first time. No, he had experienced it before. For one year after entering the company, he didn\u2019t make any achievements. He was despised by the company until he stole some of Ming Yu\u2019s resources and the situation improved.</p><br/><p>At that time, Cheng Su thought that even if he robbed some resources from Ming Yu, he would only stagnant for a bit before eventually recovering.</p><br/><p>It was unclear if this was intention or unintentional, but after the suppression by Cheng Su, Ming Yu really rose up and was going further and further.</p><br/><p>There might be a big gap with the current Ming Yu but Cheng Su believed that he would pull this man down sooner or later! Cheng Su was still trying to collect evidence behind the scenes. As long as he had a bit more time and certainty, he would take down this shameless villain who walked through the back door!</p><br/><p>However, things didn\u2019t develop as Cheng Su thought.</p><br/><p>After the cigarette endorsement fell through, Cheng Su wasn\u2019t too concerned. He didn\u2019t think this matter was related to Ming Yu. This was the world\u2019s top cigarette brand, how could Ming Yu make it do anything?</p><br/><p>But! Five days passed!</p><br/><p>A luxury brand that originally invited Cheng Su to participate in the catwalk suddenly changed their mind and refused to let him participate. Cheng Su got a bad feeling and he started feeling uneasy.</p><br/><p>There was the reality show that intended to invite him only for them to suddenly stop contacting him. Then there was the cover for a first-tier magazine. In half a month, they changed their mind and would no longer use it!</p><br/><p>Obviously, Cheng Su had been talking to them just last week and he was ready to shoot! How did it suddenly change?!!!</p><br/><p>For a time, apart from the original endorsements and advertisements that Cheng Su already had, all his future contracts and jobs completely disappeared!</p><br/><p>Despite a succession of jobs ending inexplicably, Zeng Shu unexpectedly never said a word about it and didn\u2019t even give Cheng Su and explanation!</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was stupid but even he knew this wasn\u2019t normal.</p><br/><p>After the endorsement of a small brand was pushed away, Cheng Su went to Zeng Shu\u2019s door and knocked. He stood in front of Zeng Shu\u2019s desk with a gloomy expression and asked, \u201cBrother Zeng, where did I offend you. Why do you want to do this to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu was sending an email to the head of a French luxury brand when he suddenly heard this. He didn\u2019t immediately response, leisurely finishing off his task before turning to look at Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu asked, \u201cYou offended me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su hesitated for a moment before nodding heavily.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu sneered before sighing. \u201cYou aren\u2019t right but you also aren\u2019t wrong. You really did offend me. Cheng Su, you are the most disobedient model that I have ever taken under my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was stunned by this and cried out, \u201cBrother Zeng, I didn\u2019t disobey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheng Su.\u201d The deep and ruthless voice rang out in the quiet office. There was no smile on Zeng Shu\u2019s face as he said, \u201cFrom a long time ago, I told you not to mess with people you shouldn\u2019t provoke. You should know your position and know how much you are capable of. Just go your own way and do what you can do with your abilities. Do you think I don\u2019t know that you didn\u2019t listen to me words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s heart tightened at these words and he thought of something.</p><br/><p>However, he still tried hard to defend himself. \u201cBrother Zeng, I really didn\u2019t do anything. I have listening to you and participated in the endorsements and fashion shows you got for me. I haven\u2019t done anything else! You can ask Xiao An. I have been listening\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Bang!</i></p><br/><p>A hand slammed hard against the table.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu didn\u2019t seem to feel any pain in his hand as he sneered. \u201cYou are really challenging my patience. Apart from Zhao Rui, I have never seen anyone in the world as dumb as you. You have a bit of ability so I\u2019ve been tolerating it. But do you think you are in such high demand that you dare to bite at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no dirty words in this sentence but the scolded Cheng Su couldn\u2019t help turning red.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu didn\u2019t have any more patience and directly said, \u201cYou should think about what you want to do next. I have no time to talk to you. You can either leave Muse or change agents. In any case, there is only one year left in the contract. I have no way to take you on again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I have no way to take you on again.\u2019</p><br/><p>These words were like a bolt from the blue, making Cheng Su freeze in place.</p><br/><p>After a while, he begged through his dry throat. \u201cBrother Zeng, I know I was really wrong. I shouldn\u2019t go against Ming Yu and I won\u2019t cause him trouble later. I really didn\u2019t commit any cries during this period of time. I didn\u2019t even see his face so how could I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Zeng Shu was extremely angry at this shameless guy and asked sarcastically, \u201cCheng Su, do you really think I don\u2019t know your little tricks? What is the cause of Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s recent actions? What is the matter of 20 million yuan? You know what you did in the back! In Muse, we have never poured dirty water on people in our own company. You are the first and only one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was shocked when the name \u2018Jiang Kaiyang\u2019 came from Zeng Shu\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Then he gritted his teeth. \u201cBrother Zeng, I have been with you for three years. Do you really want to suppress me for this little thing? I know I was really wrong so give me a way out. I\u2019ve been showing a good performance under your hand. Don\u2019t you wish to see your people do well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu looked slightly surprised by the words before suddenly laughing. \u201cCheng Su, are you really stupid or just playing the fool? I am suppressing you? Do you think I am the only one who can find out about your actions? Ming Yu can find out! Speaking to me is no use. Go and find Ming Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su woke up completely at these words.</p><br/><p>But after leaving Zeng Shu\u2019s office, how could Cheng Su really go to find Ming Yu?</p><br/><p>Apologize? Beg for mercy?</p><br/><p>Cheng Su couldn\u2019t do either of them!</p><br/><p>At first, he didn\u2019t think his recent matters had anything to do with Ming Yu. After thinking about it, he realized instantly. Ming Yu didn\u2019t have the ability to kill him right now but Xi Ze did. Xi Ze was Ming Yu\u2019s gold master!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was a filthy person who sold his body!</p><br/><p>A disgusting homosexual!</p><br/><p>Cheng Su apologizing to him?</p><br/><p>He could dream!</p><br/><p>Cheng Su could only insist that Ming Yu was suppressing him through Xi Ze. He never imagined that at this moment, a man standing on the top floor of the Ji and Ya studio was saying helplessly through the phone, \u201cYou don\u2019t like him then let me stop him. Why are you going through such trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, who was on a small overseas island for a photo shoot, sighed heavily. \u201cXi Ze, this is my own personal matter. Before, I couldn\u2019t cope with Karma so you must intervene. It couldn\u2019t be helped. But I can solve the problem of Cheng Su myself. You don\u2019t have to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcept I don\u2019t think he is too good. \u201cThere was a pause before the man smiled. \u201cIt is very uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the person that his family\u2019s mushroom liked before, how could he be cool?</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu sighed. \u201cIn my current position, blocking him from entering the supermodel rankings is no problem. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. If you aren\u2019t happy then wait for me to get revenge for my unhappy matters before talking about your problem. Don\u2019t you know it is first come, first served?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised his eyebrows. \u201cI really don\u2019t know. Am I a good citizen who pays attention to first come, first served?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu immediately questioned, \u201cSir, have you forgotten the third rule of our family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu righteously declared, \u201cIn the family, as long as the owner says so, his words are an imperial decree!\u201d</p><br/><p>It could be said that if Ming Yu wanted to ban Cheng Su from the industry, it took a bit of effort. But assuming that he really wanted to do it, he would only have to spend a bit of effort and he could absolutely do so.</p><br/><p>A supermodel who immediately entered the top 50 of the rankings and then became 16th the second time. The other was a 23 year old who hadn\u2019t even entered the rankings. Who was more important? Anyone with discerning eyes could see it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t afraid of revenge. Even if Cheng Su wanted to discredit him, there was no evidence.</p><br/><p>As early as half a year ago, Ming Xiaoyu arranged a person to carefully watch Cheng Su. There was a small incident where Cheng Su got Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s number through a back door and wasn\u2019t discovered by the private investigator. But otherwise, Ming Xiaoyu had a private detective stare closely at Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su tried to bribe a private detective to watch Ming Yu in order to find black materials, but was it that simple?</p><br/><p>As the saying went, money could make the devil turn millstones! (Anything can be done with money) Cheng Su bribed the detective but Ming Yu paid a larger sum to buy the detective off. Therefore, Cheng Su never got any useful black material.</p><br/><p>Everything was ready, he just needed an east wind. (lacking one crucial item)</p><br/><p>Cheng Su wasn\u2019t a great man printed on the coin. As long as he didn\u2019t appear in public for three months, everyone would forget about the existence of this person. This type of ban might seem slow but it would slowly erode Cheng Su\u2019s confidence, making him fall step by step to the end.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had long been dissatisfied with this Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>For the first time in his two words, he was confronted with a villain who occasionally slapped him in the face and responded to him. Moreover, Ming Yu knew that if he didn\u2019t deal with Cheng Su, Cheng Su would always be behind him, secretly staring at him.</p><br/><p>An enemy hiding in the dark, it was best to eliminate him as soon as possible. Previously, Ming Yu had no straightforward way to solve the problem because Ming Yu remembered the wish of the original body. Now this wish had been thoroughly realized and Ming Xiaoyu had no scruples.</p><br/><p>Since Cheng Su was going to be completely blocked, Ming Yu would stop him from completely changing his fortunes!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He didn\u2019t toss and turn all night, instead having a sweet sleep. In the morning, he was full of vitality as he woke up. After washing up, Luo Ru\u2019s car was downstairs, so he quickly prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>It was as if nothing had happened yesterday. Ming Yu didn\u2019t feel anxious about the name \u2018Xi Ze\u2019 and rushed to work as usual.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru was an attentive person, but she didn\u2019t find any anomalies in Ming Yu. She saw Ming Yu in the rearview mirror and opened the door. At the same time, she handed him a bag of hot breakfast and said, \u201cMing Yu, Brother Zhao has gone to CX Entertainment today to talk about the MV cooperation. The negotiation might take a long time, so he won\u2019t be able to be present for the next two days. Today, we are going to make a series of advertisements for Shuyue Lemonade. You will be doing this for the next two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu took the paper bag containing breakfast with a \u2018thank you.\u2019 After hearing Luo Ru\u2019s words, he replied, \u201cYes Sister Luo. I know. Then I will thank you for following me over the next two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru smiled and shook her head. \u201cThis is my job.\u201d After a pause, Luo Ru added, \u201cCome on, eat while it is hot. The meals that the crew provides might not be good. You need more nutrition, so today, I will give you five cups of the nutritional drink to help you grow taller quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wilted at the thought of the medicinal drink. That stuff was so terrifying that Xi Ze was just a slag compared to it.</p><br/><p>A whole mess of things were put in the medicinal drink. Ming Yu had been drinking it for almost a month and he thought he could taste it, but Luo Ru always said it was just an illusion.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s mouth slightly twitched as he ate the soft bun, while turning to look at the sky outside the window.</p><br/><p>The car slowly headed west and soon disappeared in the crowded traffic, no traces of it being seen.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t tell Luo Ru that he met Xi Ze last night, and he naturally didn\u2019t tell Zhao Rui. He could imagine what Luo Ru and Zhao Rui\u2019s reactions would be if they learned of the incident.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui would definitely worry. He had a good relationship with Ding Bo and would wonder if Ming Yu should really become the exclusive model. Luo Ru was even simpler. She would be very much in favour of Ming Yu cooperating with Xi Ze, and would work hard to make it happen.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed as he thought about it, looking up at the yellow orange sky out the window.</p><br/><p>As Xi Ze said last night, the easier way to rise to the top of the fashion industry was to become his exclusive model. He was Xi Ze, his high fashion show was always at the peak of the industry, with each invited model being from the industry\u2019s top supermodels. Out of the 200 people on the supermodel list, Xi Ze invited at least 150.</p><br/><p>As long as you appeared in Xi Ze\u2019s fashion show, you would naturally get many endorsements, advertisements and other jobs. These excellent jobs could quickly make you popular in the industry. He Chaoman appeared in this high-end fashion show not long after her debut, allowing her to miraculously be ranked 32nd on the female top supermodels list in two months!</p><br/><p>But this time, Xi Ze\u2019s invitation to Ming Yu wasn\u2019t as simple as \u2018please appear in my fashion show.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was proposing: \u201cPlease only be mine.\u201d It was a terrible agreement.</p><br/><p>To any designer, their muse was the source of their inspiration. They would frantically grab this person and make them the most special person.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t elaborate during last night\u2019s speech, but Ming Yu could hear his meaning. Xi Ze wanted Ming Yu to become his exclusive model, and only walk in Xi Ze\u2019s shows.</p><br/><p>In fact, this wasn\u2019t a bad thing. How many people dreamt about becoming Xi Ze\u2019s exclusive model? After all, Xi Ze only did four shows a year. Each show had more than 100 pieces, so it wasn\u2019t a small amount of work for a model.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t what Ming Yu wanted.</p><br/><p>At least until he possessed the power not to be affected by the name \u2018Xi Ze,\u2019 he would never have that brand before his name.</p><br/><p>\u300e In the fashion industry, Ming Yu would never be Xi Ze\u2019s Ming Yu. \u300f</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked out the window at the skyscrapers flying by and drank the last of the soy milk. He sighed softly, put the paper bag on the seat next to him and leaned back against the soft chair, getting a small rest.</p><br/><p>In the driver\u2019s seat, Luo Ru heard Ming Yu sigh and looked at him, but couldn\u2019t find anything unusual.</p><br/><p>Soon, the car arrived at a studio located on the West Fourth Ring Road. The staff members had waited at the door for a long time and hurriedly brought Ming YU and Luo Ru inside. Along the way, the staff members couldn\u2019t help looking at Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Today, Ming Yu was wearing a light blue coat over white-blue jeans, with a pair of leather boots on his feet. He was fair-skinned and handsome. The youthful style of clothing made him look more vibrant, plus he had an outstanding temperament. Once Ming Yu entered the studio, many eyes couldn\u2019t help falling on him.</p><br/><p>Today, Ming Yu was going to shoot a series of advertisements for a beverage. Like many advertisements, this one intended to use \u2018love\u2019 as a line that was interjected through the ads. So, there would be two protagonists today. In addition to Ming Yu, Luo Ru said there was a second-tier actress.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu just entered the studio when the deputy director hurried up to greet him.</p><br/><p>As the deputy director, Cheng Yongzhi was responsible for on-site coordination. He was busy and became anxious over why the actress hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Therefore, he was delighted when he saw that Ming Yu had arrived half an hour early.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Ming Yu? Hello, you came very early today. Have you eaten breakfast yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was surprised by this enthusiastic attitude. He naturally didn\u2019t know that just before, Chen Yongzhi had received a call telling him that the actress was stuck on the East Second Ring Road. How could he not be impatient? Now that he saw Ming Yu arriving early, he was so elated that he couldn\u2019t help feeling a touch of affection for Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and reached out to the other person. \u201cHello, I have already eated. Are you Deputy Director Chen? Should I go to make-up now? I think by the time I finish the make-up, the timing will be similar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yongzhi made a strange expression at these words and he gulped. \u201cThat\u2026 Ming Yu, you go to make-up. Later, if Yang Lala hasn\u2019t arrived yet, we will shoot you first. After all, you have a few solo shots.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sent Chen Yongzhi a meaningful look after hearing those words. After a long while, he gently smiled and nodded. \u201cYes Deputy Director Chen. Then I will now go to make-up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yongzhi asked, \u201cBy the way Ming Yu, you have read the script, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu nodded. \u201cRest assured, Deputy Director Chen. I have spent the past few days reading the script.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Chen Yongzhi let the staff bring Ming Yu to the dressing room, while leaving to supervise the site layout.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu and Luo Ru walked in the direction of the dressing room. On the way, Luo Ru laughed and asked, \u201cThe script should be good, right? Ming Yu, do you have many lines? Have you memorized them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was dumbfounded when he heard this. \u201cSister Luo, you must be joking. This script, I basically have no lines!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>No lines\u2014 This was why Ming Yu\u2019s choice of advertisement was very important.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu knew that his acting was really\u2026 He couldn\u2019t bear to look at it. So, in order to not jeopardize others and for his own self-esteem, he didn\u2019t want to get involved in the entertainment industry. He was honestly about his abilities, and didn\u2019t want to harm the public.</p><br/><p>In this advertisement, Ming Yu played a man selling drinks in a small roadside shop. When the heroine was distracted, he was responsible for delivering a bottle of Shuyue Lemonade to the heroine. When the heroine was excited about finding a job, he was responsible for delivering a bottle of Shuyue Lemonade to the heroine. The heroine was sad, he handed her lemonade. The heroine was grieving, he still handed her lemonade\u2026</p><br/><p>Handing over lemonade, handing over lemonade, handing over lemonade\u2026</p><br/><p>Such a simple job, he could still be just a beautiful face.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu chose this advertisement for this reason, but Luo Ru was somewhat unhappy. \u201cWell, this will earn points with advertisers and increase your exposure.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the two people arrived at the dressing room and the staff leading them went back to work. Ming Yu chuckled and raised an eyebrow at Luo Ru\u2019s words. \u201cSister Luo, why do you think I have no lines?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru was surprised and didn\u2019t know how to react. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu gave a low laugh, highlighting his exquisite facial features. He asked, \u201cDo you know why Shuyue Lemonade looked for me to be in the advertisement?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru thought for a moment and replied. \u201cYour popularity has risen lately. Your popularity among young people is even higher, so you are deserving to be chosen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu shook his head and spoke lightly, \u201cThat isn\u2019t the most important reason. The most important and core reason is that they know I don\u2019t need a speaking part. They want my sense of presence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Ru\u2019s expression said: I don\u2019t believe that your acting is so good!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s face darkened and he quickly explained. \u201cI mean that just by standing there, I will give off a presence\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he had never seen the actress, Ming Yu believed that he knew what type of attitude was required when handing over the lemonade\u2026 He needed to maximize his sense of presence, while not destroying the story of the advertisement.</p><br/><p>The two people entered the dressing room. The make-up artist\u2019s method was good but her movements were a bit slow. Therefore, Ming Yu took 20 minutes to do his make-up.</p><br/><p>His make-up was so light that it could hardly be seen with the naked eye. However, this simple modification made his face look younger and more handsome.</p><br/><p>After putting on a T-shirt and jeans, forget among the staff members\u2019 amazed eyes. Even Luo Ru couldn\u2019t help staring at him before she praised him. \u201cYou really look good. Now that you are dressed like this, I finally believe that you are a 17 year old boy.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

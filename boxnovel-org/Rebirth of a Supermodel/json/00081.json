Numerous fans hadn\u2019t registered at Muse\u2019s official website because they shrugged off the hardships. It was just before Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s birthday that they broke through the horrifying 100 questions and answers to become a full member.</p><br/><p>The reason they wanted to become full members was because only regular members could join other fans to participate in the \u2018Ming Xiaoyu Adult Ceremony Celebration.\u2019</p><br/><p>At midnight the same day, Ming Yu was carefully sleeping but his fan forum was fully blowing up. All sorts of \u2018Happy birthday Ming Xiaoyu, you finally reached adulthood. Let\u2019s eat mushroom cake to celebrate\u2019 could be seen when scrolling through the forum.</p><br/><p>This time, there was no moderator who shouted \u2018banned\u2019 and rushed to delete posts. Everyone was happily celebrating Ming Yu\u2019s birthday. There were many fans who uploaded photos of cakes they made, using chocolate sauce to write on the cake\u2014</p><br/><p>Wish: Ming Yu, happy birthday!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s heart was touched when he woke up and saw the small gifts from the fans. He took the time to reply to several posts and finally made a post at the top of the forum.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Yu: Thank you for your blessings, thank you for your company. I will pick 10 fans who reply to this post before midnight tonight and give then a signed poster. This is a good morning kiss of love. Rest early and don\u2019t be tired ^\uff3f^\u3011</p><br/><p>The fan forum immediately exploded because of this post and Ming Yu rushed to get up. He freshened up and headed downstairs where Luo Ru was waiting.</p><br/><p>Once he got into the car, Luo Ru said with a smile, \u201cHappy birthday Xiaoyu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and nodded. \u201cThank you, Sister Luo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s birthday in his previous life was the same in this life, so he had nothing to adapt this. It was another adult ceremony, but it made him feel a little refreshed.</p><br/><p>In the car, Ming Yu told Luo Ru about his post in the forum. Luo Ru said she would take care of the matter and Ming Yu didn\u2019t have to worry.</p><br/><p>The car was stuck in the crowded traffic for half an hour before finally making its way down the elevated road to Ruoshang Hall. Last week, Ming Yu had booked a table here and invited all the friends he made this year to eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere you are, please go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee stopped in front of a box and bowed politely. Ming Yu thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door.</p><br/><p>The moment the door opened, <em>bang bang bang </em>was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Xiaoyu, happy birthday!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Colourful streamers flew through the air, most of them falling on Ming Yu\u2019s body. He laughed and pulled the coloured strips off his hair and clothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess this must be Brother Zhao\u2019s idea.\u201d Ming Yu looked at the crowd at the table and asked, \u201cBrother Zhao, did you suggest for them to give me such a surprise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui couldn\u2019t help replying, \u201cHow did you know Xiaoyu?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s eyes flashed playfully after hearing these words. He gently coughed twice before saying very solemnly, \u201cBecause Brother Zhao, only you would have such a childish heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think that you can bully people because today is your birthday!!</p><br/><p>The guests that Ming Yu invited today were his old friends. From Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian to the photographer Tao Qin and the founder of the name \u2018Small Mushroom\u2019, Zhu Kejia. they were all given invitations.</p><br/><p>Most people were present, but some didn\u2019t come.</p><br/><p>For example, Du Ruo was attending a fashion show in France. There was no way for her to return home so she sent Ming Xiaoyu a beautiful gem collar as a birthday gift and to compensate for her absence.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t too familiar with people like Ding Bo and Shen Xiang and didn\u2019t invite them.</p><br/><p>As for Xi Ze? He wasn\u2019t invited!</p><br/><p>If Xi Ze was sitting in this box, everyone in the room (except Ming Yu) would feel uncomfortable and the atmosphere would be completely stiff.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t doubt this man\u2019s ability to make everyone respect him.</p><br/><p>Many people had jobs the next day and Ming Yu\u2019s meal was at lunch time. Therefore, only a few bottles of red wine were opened in order to not disturb people\u2019s work in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was so caring towards his friends. He never expected them to be ungrateful! During this meal, six bottles of red wine were opened. At least two bottles went straight into Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was eating a piece of lamb when Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian came over. They smiled and said, \u201cYou are finally an adult and can drink wine. Ming Xiaoyu, I wish you a happy birthday. Let\u2019s drink to today and every year after today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>They actually just wanted to get him drunk\u2026</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was eating some baby cabbages when Zhu Kejia came over with a crystal mushroom necklace. She said, \u201cSince you are 18 years old, you are an adult. Small Mushroom, I specifically found someone to make you a custom crystal mushroom. Doesn\u2019t it look like you? Come come, toast with your Sister Zhu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026==\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t look good!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had just sent Zhu Kejia away when Tao Qin came. Once Tao Qin left, it was Fei Sixin! It was hard to get away. He fished the wine with Fei Sixin and sent her away. Ming Yu hadn\u2019t regained his stability yet when he looked up and\u2014</p><br/><p>Damn it! Brother Yuan, A\u2019Zhao, Old Chen and A\u2019Xue came in a group!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>What were they doing skipping class?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s ability to hold his liquor was still good. It was the first time he drank so much wine, despite being red wine. However, after drinking too bottles, he only needed to go to the toilet a few times. He wasn\u2019t too tipsy and just felt slightly dizzy.</p><br/><p>As Ming Yu walked into the bathroom, he stood in the doorway for a moment. He seemed to be remembering his first meeting with a certain man. Behind him, Zhao Rui gently poked him in the back and asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you going in Xiaoyu? Oh, are you remembering how you gave Xi Ze toilet paper here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Fei who entered after them, \u201c\uff08\u00b0\u00b0\uff1b\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to have heard something incredible\u2026</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Ming Yu, Zhao Rui and Luo Ru stood at the door of Ruoshang Hall to send away all the guests. Before leaving, everyone blessed Ming Yu with a happy birthday and gave him a hug.</p><br/><p>However, after his daughter left, Old Fei stayed behind and looked at Ming Yu strangely. Ming Xiaoyu was confused and couldn\u2019t understand what was happening. This child, he drank a lot today. He wasn\u2019t completely drunk but he hadn\u2019t sobered up from the wine.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Old Fei gazed meaningfully at Ming Yu and exclaimed, \u201cXiaoyu, you are a man!\u201d</p><br/><p>Blank-faced Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2299\uff3f\u2299\uff09?\u201d</p><br/><p>Giving Xi Ze toilet paper, wasn\u2019t this a man?</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Zhao Rui and Luo Ru helped Ming Yu bring the birthday presents to the car and then sent Ming Yu home. On the way, Zhao Rui proposed to go karaoke with Ming Yu at night. He could also call some friends. But Ming Yu shook his head and refused.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui asked with surprised, \u201cXiaoyu, do you have something to do at night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu shook his head and explained. \u201cBrother Zhao, I drank quite a lot today. My head is still a little dizzy and I want to have a good rest. Thank you for your kindness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui didn\u2019t think much of it. Then Luo Ru looked at Ming Yu through the rearview mirror and asked, \u201cXiaoyu, should I go upstairs with you to make hangover soup? This is the first time you drank so much wine, even though it is red wine. You must pay attention to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu chuckled and shook his head. \u201cNo Sister Luo. I just need a little rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the Muse apartments, Zhao Rui and Luo Ru helped Ming Yu carry all the gifts upstairs and then left first. It was around 5 o\u2019clock in the evening. Ming Xiaoyu opened the pile of gifts in the living room.</p><br/><p>Putting aside Zhu Kejia, other people sent more traditional gifts. Only Sister Zhu\u2019s one was bad. She took the opportunity to encourage others by placing the crystal mushroom necklace around his neck while he was drinking.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought of this and hurriedly got up to take the necklace off. He had just stepped out of the gift pile when he suddenly heard the doorbell ring.</p><br/><p>His feet paused and then Ming Yu realized who it was. He couldn\u2019t help his lips curving upwards as he walked briskly towards the door. He opened it, smiled at the person outside and joked, \u201cXi Ze, I have waited two months. What adult gift are you going to give me?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

While the phone rang all night in the living room, both of them were moving fiercely in the upstairs bedroom.</p><br/><p>This sudden movement didn\u2019t give others time to prepare!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze and Ming Yu\u2019s address was naturally told to their agents and assistants. However, the two of them didn\u2019t answer their phones all night so neither Ding Bo or Zhao Rui dared to act rashly. In the morning, Xi Ze went downstairs first to prepare something for breakfast when he received a call from Zhao Rui.</p><br/><p>When the phone was connected, Zhao Rui assumed that the other person was Ming Yu. Therefore, he opened his mouth and said, \u201cYou finally answered the phone, you finally answered the phone! Xiaoyu QAQ, what did Xi Ze do last night? Why don\u2019t you look at him? What happened last night? How did you get jealous and let Xi Ze post that Weibo? Why is Xi Ze so stupid? Xiaoyu, last night\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Rui.\u201d The man\u2019s cold and low voice interrupted Zhao Rui\u2019s chatter.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was stunned and his body froze as he heard Xi Ze ask calmly, \u201cAm I very stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>A chill rushed from Zhao Rui\u2019s brain to the soles of his feet, causing him to shiver. He could only stammer as he replied, \u201cNo no\u2026 you aren\u2019t stupid. You aren\u2019t stupid at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze hummed gently, making Zhao Rui feel tense. Then he looked at his phone and slowly frowned. The slender fingers slid gently on the keyboard. The more he looked, the more he frowned.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Zhao Rui thought he couldn\u2019t hear the other party\u2019s reply when he heard Xi Ze asked, \u201cWas anything done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was surprised before he understood the other person\u2019s meaning. Zhao Rui thought \u2018Xi Ze\u2019s reaction is so fast\u2019 before answering, \u201cNo. We didn\u2019t know what happened to you so we didn\u2019t dare do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze carefully thought about it before calmly giving an order. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a big deal. We will reveal it to the public.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke \u2018reveal it to the public\u2019 casually, like it was nothing.</p><br/><p>But a night passed, a full 11 hours! Fans all over the world were shocked!!!</p><br/><p>After Zyu posted on his Weibo, the initial reactions were this:</p><br/><p>\u3010 25 years old? What? God Z is only 25 years old? I really didn\u2019t expect it. I thought that God Z was a 30 year old, portly upstart (joking 23333)! Hello, rich and handsome 25 year old man~ \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Oh, God Z actually confessed to our mushroom! @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg, quickly look. Your husband is cheating on you! XDDD \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Why do I feel like this is so funny? God Z gave us a clear confession on Weibo and he isn\u2019t afraid of his wife\u2019s jealousy. This time @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg will really break God Z\u2019s legs~ \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 LS\uff0cwhich leg will be broken ~~~~~~ \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>A hot atmosphere spread through Zyu\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>God Z always liked to show love with his wife. This high-profile dog food sucked in a lot of fans. Therefore, Zyu\u2019s number of fans reached the hundreds of thousands a long time ago. Due to his influence, Ming Yu\u2019s fans also broke through 200,000.</p><br/><p>Thus, even if he posted something in the middle of the night, it would be instantly discovered by fans. Even if it was deleted in seconds, there might be screenshots as evidence of Xi Ze\u2019s guilt.</p><br/><p>Fans were like water. They could carry a boat but they could also sink it.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere at the beginning was still harmonious. People keep going to Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s side account, telling him that his God Z was cheating! He bluntly confessed to Ming Yu! But slowly, someone found something wrong with this post.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Wait, why does God Z think Ming Xiaoyu is jealous? He also says that Xiaoyu is very cute? Has he seen Ming Xiaoyu act jealous? Oh, why do I feel dizzy? God Z\u2019s words are obviously problematic! This is so strange\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>Once someone pointed out the strange point, many people found several things.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Yes! How could God Z have seen Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s jealousy? Has he been around Ming Xiaoyu? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Is God Z actually Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s friend, assistant or agent? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 How can that be? God Z said, \u2018You are my only first love\u2019 and then \u2018kiss you!\u2019 It\u2019s obviously a confession! This is wrong! If you say that God Z has seen Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s jealous look\u2026 I don\u2019t believe that with his nature, God Xi will let other men see Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s jealous look. Even if this is true, God Z is sure to know Ming Xiaoyu! Why is God Z blatantly confessing his love to Ming Xiaoyu when he clearly has a wife? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 LS\u2019s analysis is right! Based on the word \u2018jealousy\u2019, God Z probably knows Ming Xiaoyu. In fact, I have discovered it before. When God Z and Goddess Xiao competed to be leader of the mushroom fans, it appeared like he knew Xiao Biqing and Ming Xiaoyu. Now he confessed to Ming Xiaoyu\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 My family\u2019s mushroom is bent. He said that he only likes God Xi in this life so he is completely homosexual. Under such circumstances, God Z dares to ignore God Xi and confess? He isn\u2019t afraid of God Xi coming for him? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The mysterious truth was slowly revealed by the masses stripping off the cocoon.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the masses were bright and the wisdom of the masses was endless.</p><br/><p>Numerous guesses emerged on Weibo and the fan forum. Then someone asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t the biggest possibility that Zyu is actually God Xi?\u201d The entire fan group became quiet for a moment before an endless\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ahhhhhh?!!! God Z is actually God Xi? This must be April Fool\u2019s Day ahhh! \u3011</p><br/><p>After gaining the right direction, everyone would follow the result to find the process. All of a sudden, they found a variety of evidence!</p><br/><p>For example, there was a time when God Z accidentally exposed his shoes when taking a photo of the magazines! Xi Ze\u2019s dead loyal fans hurriedly checked their computers for Xi Ze\u2019s photos. A full one hour later, an emperor found it! A photo with the same shoes!</p><br/><p>Another example was when God Z\u2019s wife took a photo of his meal and accidentally photographed his little finger. Many people praised Good Legs\u2019 appearance but now that they compared it to Ming Yu\u2019s finger\u2026</p><br/><p>WTF!!! Why couldn\u2019t they recognize their husband/son god\u2019s fingernails?</p><br/><p>Obviously, they should recognize their husband/son/god, even if it was a strand of hair!</p><br/><p>After a night of hard work and finding all the evidence, the fans already believed that God Z was definitely one of the mushroom husbands!</p><br/><p>On the other side, Muse didn\u2019t conduct any public relations. They just contacted the marketing companies and media, asking them to temporarily not pay attention to this matter.</p><br/><p>But don\u2019t underestimate the power of the fans.</p><br/><p>This group of diehard CP fans didn\u2019t sleep for most of the night and frantically poured over Ming Yu and Xi Ze\u2019s side accounted, wondering what type of dog food their gods had sprinkled.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: I haven\u2019t seen you for one day but it is like not seeing you for three autumns. When I see the snow outside the window, I think of you and your white, beautiful skin. @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: Oh, don\u2019t think that I won\u2019t be jealous if you speak words of love. Go home and kneel on the washboard //@Zyu: I haven\u2019t seen you for one day\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>The God Xi fans watching: \u2026Oh my god, this shameless literary youth is really my god?</p><br/><p>The mushroom fans watching: \u2026Oh my god, my mushroom is actually such a violent and beautiful person!</p><br/><p>The CP fans watching: \u2026Clamor clamor!! I will eat this dog food!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: It is so cold outside, let me enter the bedroom @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: There is heating outside the door.

This guy might always look like a god and you always say I should be proud of my husband. I\u2019m not very proud but I would like to say one truth. @Zyu has many shortcomings but if there is one thing to make up for all his shortcomings, it is that his cooking is really delicious!! [/Picture] [/Picture] [/Picture] \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: Dear, in fact, you are also delicious in bed //@I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: Today\u2019s dishes are delicious\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>The God Xi fans watching: \u2026.Oh my god! My good can cook! These dishes were cooked by my god!</p><br/><p>The mushroom fans watching: \u2026Mushroom is so sweet. His words might be hard but he really loves God Xi!</p><br/><p>The CP fans watching: \u2026Clamor clamor!! Eat well in bed! Play!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The above Weibo was really very ordinary and there wasn\u2019t any explosion. Looking again, these two husbands had no moral integrity and openly flirted with each other on Weibo! What type of dirty jokes were said? Even the CP fans felt it was too much!</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: I want to break your legs! Dammit!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: Is it okay to grab it?

You were too tired last night but your little tail was really cute. \u3011</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u2026.Pretends not to understand \u2044(\u2044 \u2044\u2022\u2044\u03c9\u2044\u2022\u2044 \u2044)\u2044!!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: I wrote a script today. Maybe I should switch to being a screenwriter. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: I practiced it last night. @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg also thinks that the script was very good [/Laughs] \u3011</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u2026.Pretends not to understand \u2044(\u2044 \u2044\u2022\u2044\u03c9\u2044\u2022\u2044 \u2044)\u2044!!</p><br/><p>Dammit!

The Huaxia of this world placed great importance on copyrights, so their sales were quite high. No readers would take the liberate to spread the pages only, and there were no pirate manufacturers who would print an inferior produce.</p><br/><p>In fact, a supplementary number of 10,000 copies was ordinary. Every year, Character would do two or three such supplements. In most cases, it was due to big models, celebrities or important news stories.</p><br/><p>But this time\u2026</p><br/><p>This issue looked normal? The British male model on the cover could be considered relatively popular, while the female on the inside of the cover wasn\u2019t that known. Could it be the key news? But this time, Character didn\u2019t release any breaking news in order to focus on next month\u2019s annual release.</p><br/><p>Was it because of that?</p><br/><p>Huaxia\u2019s fashion magazines held votes for the best section on their official website. Just like in the last Fashion Entertainment poll, the most popular section was the \u201818 years old\u2019 section. This time in Character\u2019s pill, the most popular wasn\u2019t the handsome cover or the sexy and enchanting girl on the inside cover. It was\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Glorious Years.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the name suggested, \u2018The Glorious Years\u2019 was about the bright and beautiful years of youth. The tall and handsome Wu Yuzhen, feminine and neutral Liu Qian, bright and sunny Zhu Wei (his image) and the handsome and elegant Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Four different types of beautiful men gathered together, the visual impact was too large!</p><br/><p> In the forum area of Character\u2019s official website, there were several such voices.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Lick lick lick!!! I will sponsor a month of instant noodles money to see those four again! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 This is great! The photo of Sister Qian coming out of the water is almost erotic! As a straight man, I am typing with both feet to prove my innocence! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Sir Wu is a prince! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zhu Wei isn\u2019t bad. He still looks good despite standing in front of Sir Wu \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>Liu Qian\u2019s appearance was more neutral, so he was given the nickname of \u2018Sister Qian.\u2019 Wu Yuzhen previously had a role in a small-budget movie where he played a police officer, so fans called him Sir Wu. Zhu Wei\u2019s popularity was behind theirs, but they could only be compared to Ming Yu when the three of them were added together.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ah aha ah ah ah Ming Xiaoyu is too handsome!!! The photo with the red wine is life!! \u3011 (TL: Basically, calling him Ming Little Yu. I decided to go with Ming Xiaoyu because it is a nickname they will use a lot)</p><br/><p>\u3010 No no, don\u2019t bend over! Someone stop my son! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 The positioning of the four people is really accurate. Liu Qian and Wu Yuzhen\u2019s positions are no different from normal. Zhu Wei\u2019s positioning isn\u2019t bad, but his performance is more ordinary and tepid. The most surprising one if Ming Yu! This melancholy and elegant image really unexpectedly fits him. I originally thought he had the noble and cold image, but he is wearing a wet shirt like Liu Qian and it is really tempting! Ah, I have gone from being indifferent to being a huge fan. get\u221a \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 The emperor\u2019s analysis! Favourite +1. The \u2018natural carving of a fresh lotus.\u2019 This is really natural! It is a fairy!! I won\u2019t say that I stared at Ming Xiao Jade\u2019s chest for a long, long time\u2026.\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ah, I made a typo. I meant Ming Xiaoyu. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 His nipples were exposed? !!! I just looked through the magazine and it is true! Ah ah ah ah, white shirt + water. It is simply a big kill!!! You aren\u2019t allowed to look at my husband! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu is really great ~ the jade skin and handsome face ~ nickname get\u221a \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After the Fasion Entertainment typsetting event, Ming Yu wasn\u2019t an obscure small model. He didn\u2019t have many fans, but it wasn\u2019t to the extent that no one knew him. Therefore, after this issue of Character was published, the readers recognized him and flocked to the Muse website to join the \u2018Ming Yu\u2019 personal fan site.</p><br/><p>Muse had hundreds of models, each of them with their own official fan site. The highest one had more than 30 million fans and was naturally Xi Ze, while Ming Yu\u2019s fans only just reached 100,000.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ming Yu\u2019s weibo had more than 500,000 fans, because not every fan would go to the Muse website.</p><br/><p>In this way, Ming Yu\u2019s popularity increased step by step. His momentum was still heating up after the issue of Character, with no signs of reduction, prompting Muse to readjust the level of attention to him.</p><br/><p>There was a clean and tidy office, the minimalist design of black and white being the only embellishment. Before a floor to ceiling glass window, a tall and upright man was slightly bent over, his fingers lightly moving the charcoal to sketch on the paper. As he moved, black slowly infiltrated the paper and a simple and elegant skirt was drawn.</p><br/><p>He was just drawing the last line when there was a knock on the mahogany door in front of the man. After the whispered \u201cCome in,\u201d a man wearing silver glasses walked in and sat on the swivel chair in front of the desk.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just heard from Shenxiang, that kid said that the PR department is raising Ming Yu up two levels.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze continued calmly sketching as he looked down at the paper. He looked at his agent out of the corner of his eye and casually asked, \u201cMing Yu?\u201d His tone was confused, as if he really didn\u2019t know this person.</p><br/><p>Ding Bi sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend that you don\u2019t know. He is the beauty we saw last time at Ruoshang Hall, where you acted as the hero to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly sketched as he spoke flatly, \u201cOh, his name is Ming Yu.\u201d He paused before adding, \u201cI didn\u2019t act as a hero to save that beauty. I was just passing by.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long time, Ding Bo spoke. \u201cHey, don\u2019t act in front of me. Do you really not know him? As a lifelong honorary chairman of the Outward Appearance Association, how can you not know the name of the mdoel when Ming Yu looks so good? Aren\u2019t you paying attention to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze placed the pen lightly on the table and leaned back in his seat, lifting his eyes to gaze at Ding Bo. The calm and indifferent eyes looked over Ding Bo, then Xi Ze\u2019s lips curved up. \u201cAren\u2019t you very concerned about that night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo touched the goose bumps on his arm and replied, \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you are concerned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Xi Ze casually asked, \u201cHow is the king pig recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo frowned. \u201cThe person called Wang Zhu\u2026 recently, he doesn\u2019t seem very good. Since the last time you scolded him, he hasn\u2019t started on other small models. However, a dog can\u2019t be taught to not eat poo. I don\u2019t know when he will start again.\u201d</p><br/><p>A low laugh emerged from Xi Ze as he cupped his chin and grinned at the agent in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you are concerned about the king pig\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are very concerned about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know his current situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to argue Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTut, even being concerned about the king pig, your taste\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Ze! I really lost a lot of blood being your agent!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo angrily turned to leave. Just before he reached the door, he heard a loud voice behind him, \u201cOh, I poked at your centre so you are fleeing angrily to cover the up the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a really hard day!! What could he say to that? He could only learn from this mistake! Mr. Ding had been poisoned by someone for so many years and didn\u2019t realize a single truth\u2014</p><br/><p> Don\u2019t provoke Xi Ze!</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Ming Yu didn\u2019t know anything about what was going on in the Muse building. He didn\u2019t know that Ding Bo was cursing a man for the 100,0001th time, nor did he know that the number of his fans was rising at a rate visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ming Yu and Cheng Su saw each other. Ming Yu recognized Cheng Su instantly. After all, the first thing he saw after being reborn was this man\u2019s poster, so he naturally remembered the face. On the other hand, Cheng Su didn\u2019t even recognize Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>The teenager sitting in the chair, speaking humbly and warmly to Wu Mei. The smoky make-up didn\u2019t look heavy on the youth\u2019s face, it only served to emphasize his beauty, making Cheng Su startled.</p><br/><p>All designers in the fashion industry were loyal members of the Outward Appearance Association, there were even a lot who felt attached to a face.</p><br/><p>Beauty was the highest pursuit of everyone in this circle. For example, the top designers Xi Ze was, according to Ding Bo\u2019s words, a lifelong honorary chairman.</p><br/><p> They sought beauty and pursued this intangible thing all over the world. Beauty, no one wanted to degrade it.</p><br/><p>Once entering this circle, the \u2018paranoid\u2019 Cheng Su gradually began to pay attention to all the beauties around him. He was attracted to this \u2018unfamiliar\u2019 boy until he saw Zhao Rui sitting next to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui currently only had one model: Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su thought this and carefully looked at the teenager. He did look like Ming Yu. They hadn\u2019t seen each other for several months and somehow Ming Yu\u2019s temperament had changed. He wasn\u2019t as gloomy and sharp as before.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder why Cheng Su didn\u2019t recognize Ming Yu\u2014 After all, he never looked carefully at the original.</p><br/><p>After recognizing Ming Yu, Cheng Su\u2019s face turned red, then white, then green, until his assistant received the clothing. He sneered at Wu Mei and after Wu Mei greeted him, he didn\u2019t even respond as he turned around to leave.</p><br/><p>Wu Mei frowned as she looked at Cheng Su\u2019s back. \u201cStrange, Cheng Su usually isn\u2019t so arrogant. He understands how to be polite. Why isn\u2019t his attitude good this time, do you know Little Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled at the words and deflected, \u201cMaybe he isn\u2019t feeling well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Mei made an <em>oh </em>sound and didn\u2019t ask anymore, continuing with the previous topic. Zhao Rui was simmering with anger. He wanted to shake the shoulders of his small model and roar, \u201cHow can you still speak up for that bastard? Didn\u2019t you see his attitude towards you?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Rui didn\u2019t know that because Ming Yu spoke for Cheng Su, he actually made Wu Mei like him more.</p><br/><p>\u300e Not speaking bad words behind a person\u2019s back and even helping, he is such a good child. \u300f</p><br/><p> Pei Feng\u2019s first assistant designer, Wu Mei secretly thought.</p><br/><p>And what was Ming Yu thinking?</p><br/><p>\u2014Being shaken just because his face was seen? Alas, Cheng Su seemed weaker than he imagined.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

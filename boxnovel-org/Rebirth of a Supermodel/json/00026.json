At the dinner table, Liu Chao constantly toasted Ming Yu, prompting the minor to drink several glasses of red wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaoyu, later you should come back to my talk show! I will personally edit your clip, edit your clip!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to these words, Ming Yu could only nod with a dumbfounded expression. The dinner ended and the drunk Liu Chao was helped by the program\u2019s director. Zhao Rui and Luo Ru also went to get the car. At this time, Wu Yuzhen approached Ming Yu and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cMing Yu\u2026 that last question, wasn\u2019t your answer too much? You are still young and don\u2019t understand this industry. Your answer might make Xi Ze\u2019s fans angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know Wu Yuzhen long, but Ming Yu knew that he was a mature and tactful young man who often helped Ming Yu. He always liked this type of person, so he replied with a smile. \u201cSir Wu, thank you for your concern, but I know what I am doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen looked at Ming Yu with a complicated expression. He seemed to want to say something, but looking at the youth\u2019s face that was red from the alcohol, his words turned into a sigh. He replied, \u201cOkay Ming Yu. We are friends so if you need help, please call me. You have my number.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu nodded and before long, Wu Yuzhen\u2019s female agent arrived at the restaurant door first. The two people said goodbye, Ming Yu waving with a smile as he watched Wu Yuzhen get further away.</p><br/><p>Looking at the other person\u2019s car slowly disappearing into the night, Ming Yu\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed and his lips curved.</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen understood his words, but Ming Yu was afraid that Wu Yuzhen really didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>It was true that for a newcomer like him and even a model like Wu Yuzhen, they had to consider the leaders of the fashion industry. They had to respect the older generation, maintain one\u2019s image and treat people with courtesy.</p><br/><p>But for Ming Yu, such a road was too smooth.</p><br/><p>In his last life, he was like Wu Yuzhen. A down-to-earth, diligent man who got the appreciation of the designers. It would be possible to enter the world\u2019s supermodel rankings like this, but it was absolutely impossible to leap to the first ranked supermodel.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Wu Yuzhen was too young and didn\u2019t understand the feelings of the fans.</p><br/><p>If Ming Yu had said \u201cI want to go beyond Luo Cheng\u201d, maybe Luo Cheng\u2019s fans would\u2019ve hated him. But he said, \u201cI want to surpass Xi Ze.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was Xi Ze?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had never seen a man occupy the status of first supermodel for seven years. He only fell once into the top 10 due to illness, and had been first for the last two years.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze stood at the peak of the supermodels. He was unique because not only was he a superior supermodel, he was also a great designer. These two conditions were indispensable, so his fans were accustomed to \u201cMy God is in such a high place that the cold can\u2019t be overcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this case, a rookie said he wanted to go beyond Xi Ze. So what?</p><br/><p>It would only bring popularity to the newcomer, while allow fans of Xi Ze to notice this person.</p><br/><p>There might be some sunspots, but they weren\u2019t the vast majority, so there was no need to worry about them. (TL: Sunspots= Internet slang for web users who vilify a celebrity on the Internet)</p><br/><p>Standing in the deep night, with Zhao Rui driving towards him, Ming Yu placed his hands in his pockets and leisurely walked towards the car while whispering, \u201cA designer and supermodel\u2026 you are really too greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why were there no sunspots?</p><br/><p>It was because Xi Ze\u2019s fans didn\u2019t believe that a rookie could really go beyond their god. Not only did they not believe it, they didn\u2019t feel any doubts or waver at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe day that I really arrive at that position\u2026 won\u2019t it be fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s soft whisper was drowned out by the wind blowing in the autumn night of the capital, so no one could hear it.</p><br/><p>A week later, Liu Chao\u2019s Super Show was broadcasted.</p><br/><p>In the week before the show, the program\u2019s team had already edited some explosive points and promoted them on the TV 10 times a day. There were things such as \u2018Ming Yu and Wu Yuzhen\u2019s embrace\u2019, \u2018Wu Yuzhen rejects his first love,\u2019 \u2018Ming Yu said he wants to go beyond Xi Ze, causing everyone to be shocked\u2019 and so on.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu might\u2019ve gained some momentum in the past three or four months, but it was worst than Wu Yuzhen\u2019s solidly accumulated fans. Therefore, most of the people watching the program tonight were fans of Sir Wu, excitedly waiting for him to appear in their home.</p><br/><p>Once Wu Yuzhen came on, there was nothing wrong but\u2026 they couldn\u2019t help thinking the youth next to him was very good!</p><br/><p>His IQ during the program couldn\u2019t be denied!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu took the initiative to rescue Sir Wu whenever the evil host wanted to trap him!</p><br/><p>Pink bubbles!!!</p><br/><p>By the time half the show had aired, many Wu Yuzhen fans in the forums and microblogs were typing messages about the \u2018Wu Ming Husband and Husband.\u2019</p><br/><p>See for yourself!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu ad Sir Wu were under siege, but he was so smart and cute, his wife was affected by it!</p><br/><p>Of course, some people quietly wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that Ming Xiaoyu is black-bellied while Sir Wu is warm?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, these words only persisted for a few minutes. It was all about the \u2018Ming Wu CP overhead sky, \u2018Wu Ming is my Wu Ming\u2019 and \u2018In this life, I have no regrets about following the Ming Wu CP.\u2019</p><br/><p>Liu Chao\u2019s Super Show\u2019s ratings were rising. By the time it was the latter part of the show, it had already broken through 1! This result was quite gratifying for Liu Chao\u2019s Super Show, but the program knew that the real explosion hadn\u2019t yet appeared!</p><br/><p>Sure enough, when the \u2018Who do you want to surpass? segment was shown, the audience watched Wu Yuzhen\u2019s reply and couldn\u2019t help praising him. Even passersby realized his hard work and had good feelings towards him.</p><br/><p>However, when they watched again\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person I most want to go beyond is Xi Ze.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fruit fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Tea was sprayed.</p><br/><p>Hair dryers burnt hair\u2026</p><br/><p>All types of reactions were happening in front of the TV, as one phrase constantly repeated in their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a mistakeeeee?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the television, the youth smiled at the horrified Liu Chao and Wu Yuzhen and calmly explained, \u201cBefore entering the fashion industry, I really liked Xi Ze. He is my idol and I entered the industry because I want to be like him. Every time I feel tired, I think about when I saw Xi Ze\u2019s endorsement of the \u2018Red Poppy\u2019 perfume. He is my goal in this industry. I will continuously work hard and even if I can never go beyond him, I would like to look up at him.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, the young man\u2019s eyes seemed to shine like stars. That bright light full of memories and expectations made his beautiful face even more dazzling.</p><br/><p>At the beginning, the audience felt it was absurd when they heard that Ming Yu wanted to surpass Xi Ze. But once they looked at the smart and lovely young man who explain in such a solemn tone, they couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><br/><p>This was still a child!</p><br/><p>A child who wanted to stand in the same place as his idol, to be the closest to his idol.</p><br/><p>This idea was too cute!!!</p><br/><p>His young age and good looks was a great convenience to Ming Yu. The overwhelming majority of people regarded his \u2018declaration of challenge\u2019 as a child\u2019s fairy tale. The child was also so good looking that even the diehard Xi Ze couldn\u2019t help shouting, \u201cMing Yu is also a fan of the god ahhhhh! I am now a big fan! A big fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>What, 17 years wasn\u2019t young?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t necessarily the case!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t the 23 year old Wu Yuzhen and 36 year old Liu Chao watching Ming Yu? \uff3f?</p><br/><p>Immediately after Ming Yu\u2019s declaration of challenge. Liu Chao\u2019s Super Show\u2019s ratings directly broke through 1.5! This momentum didn\u2019t stop as it kept climbing, until it eventually halted at 1.7. It didn\u2019t fall below 1.5 until the program ended!</p><br/><p>What were these ratings? For a talk show, it was already huge.</p><br/><p>The program\u2019s staff excitedly got ready for dinner while fans went on Muse\u2019s official website, the major forums and the microblogs. This commotion\u2026 it couldn\u2019t be considered as noisy. It had a lively feeling like New Year\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u3010 After watching the show, I still feel like the \u2018Wu Ming CP\u2019 is high, but looking at this\u2026 don\u2019t you think that Ming Xiaoyu and God Xi also match? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I am in a trance. This is the first time someone has said that they want to go beyond God Xi. 32 points to Xiaoyu! I have become a fan \u221a \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 God Xi hasn\u2019t participated in entertainment programs for many years\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 LS sad +1\u3002 He doesn\u2019t participate in shows and almost no one mentions him in variety shows! Ming Xiaoyu is really great. I was petrified when I heard \u2018Xi Ze.\u2019 A small model dares to mention God Zi! Hey hey hey, but why can\u2019t I help think, hey hey hey\u2026 \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>There was a constant stream of these posts on the microblogs. But as time went by, many sunspots came forward.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Yu\u2019s recent development might be very good, but isn\u2019t he worse than God Xi? Going beyond God? Those are big words. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 His face is =\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f= this big! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Want to go beyond God Xi? No mistake, isn\u2019t this a hundred thousand times worse? I just went to the Muse website to take a look and Ming Yu has a fraction of God Zi\u2019s fans. Haha, hahaha! Look at the attached picture \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Those voices were only a minority, but there were a few fans who went to Ming Yu\u2019s Weibo account listed on the Muse website and left some bad comments. Quite a few of Xi Ze\u2019s fans said things like, \u201cBe polite. It is just a newcomer worshipping his idol.\u201d But the sunspots kept scolding Ming Yu on the periphery. Their force might be weak, but like a cockroach, their vitality was very strong and they didn\u2019t die!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

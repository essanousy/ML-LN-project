The pair of slender and thin hands\u2014 Hands! Destroy! He seemed like he was tenderly kneading the leaves, but he was destroying them.</p><br/><p>The handsome and noble man standing in front of the floor to ceiling windows, looking calm while playing with delicate plants.</p><br/><p>Logically, this should be a beautiful picture. However, at this moment, Shen Xiang only wanted to send the evil person in front of him into the 18 layers of hell, never seeing him again.</p><br/><p>His mind was furious, so the normally always calm Director Shen of the PR department didn\u2019t notice the tread on the door he kicked. Shen Xiang, who was upset by the Internet and various media outlets, moved to the table and sternly asked, \u201cDo you know how much impact your casual words caused?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang didn\u2019t wait for the man to replied as he immediately blamed him. \u201cYour words caused Ming Yu to get more attention than I expected. This means that I have to reconsider his status. I have to pay attention to him to see what level he should be put in! His future is full of uncertainly, but thanks to you, I have to spend at least a week paying attention to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The silent office answered him.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang wasn\u2019t aware of this yet and continued complaining. \u201cYou should know that everything you write on your websites becomes an instant success! You should at least tell me before writing something, let me be your staff. What do you mean by \u2018I will be waiting for you?\u2019 Isn\u2019t it too ambiguous? Do you want to make your fans imagine things? Isn\u2019t this a mess? You should tell me before writing something!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Another minute.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201c\u2026Xi Ze?\u201d</p><br/><p>Three minutes later.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201c\uff3f\uff08\uff1a\u0437\u300d\u2220\uff09\uff3f Xi Ze\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Another five minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201cQAQ Xi Ze, Xi Ze? Hey, Xi Ze?\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving the director of the PR department out to dry for a full 10 minutes, the cold and indifferent man put down his hands that had been \u2018lovingly\u2019 touching the leaves. He turned to look at the sofa where his long-time agent was sitting and asked, \u201cDing Bo, did you hear someone talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>The suddenly named Ding Bo thought for a moment and decided to raise his hand. \u201cYes, I heard it. Shen Xiang, isn\u2019t that kid right in front of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Xi Ze whispered in a confused manner, \u201cThen why did I only hear my door being kicked open?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201cPfft.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Shen Xiang repeated promised to ensure that the footprint and cracks on the mahogany door would be cleaned and repaired, Xi Ze suddenly found this person. He looked at Shen Xiang with extreme astonishment and asked, \u201cMr. Shen, when did you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mr. Shen whose whole body was shaking, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the beautiful glow of the sunset, the man tidied up his sleeves and seriously listened to Shen Xiang. When he heard that the other person was \u2018concerned that he couldn\u2019t determine Ming Yu\u2019s level, Xi Ze raised his head and asked, \u201cYou have to divide everyone into a level in order to manage them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xian was surprised for a moment when he heard this, before saying, \u201cIt is convenient for management. Muse has a total of more than 100 models. The PR department might have many people, but it will take too much labour and resources to watch everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze carefully thought for a long time before whispering, \u201cThis thing should be changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze replied to the puzzled Shen Xiang. \u201cSince you have to divide the models in accordance to level and Ming Yu\u2019s level can\u2019t be judged, then\u2026 he is at the highest level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201c\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo drinking water, \u201cCough cough cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Acting as if he didn\u2019t notice his agent and the director of Muse\u2019s Pr department\u2019s aghast eyes, Xi Ze raised his right index finger to his lower lip, speaking as if he was embarrassed, \u201cTemporarily set it to the highest level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201c!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>What do you mean by temporary?</p><br/><p>It seems like you are still very dissatisfied with the highest level!</p><br/><p>Come out, say what you aren\u2019t satisfied with! I will let you know who is at the highest level!!!</p><br/><p>\uff08/\u201c\u2261 \uff3f \u2261\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534</p><br/><p>Of course, these words could only be contained in Shen Xiang\u2019s stomach. A complicated expression appeared on his face as he asked Xi Ze, \u201cWhy does Ming Yu have to be at the highest level? Right now, in Muse, only you are at the highest level. Even Luo Cheng and He Chaoman aren\u2019t included. Ming Yu\u2019s recent momentum might be good, but it isn\u2019t at the highest level yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, I don\u2019t think he will reach the peak\u2026</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang silently added in his heart.</p><br/><p>After hearing his words, Xi Ze turned to look at him with surprise. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that he fits the image in my heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d There was a long pause before Shen Xiang nodded. \u201cYes, you said he was similar, but you weren\u2019t sure yet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The thin lips slightly curved up as Xi Ze showed a calm and indifferent smile. He replied in a flat tone. \u201cOh, now I am sure that sooner or later, he will become my person.\u201d Xi Ze saw Shen Xiang\u2019s expression and added, \u201cWell, my model.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was with the addition? His thoughts didn\u2019t even go that way!!!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201cOh right, the Weibo message I just posted? Don\u2019t thank me. I just helped you maintain the hot topic. Of course, if you must thank me, I don\u2019t mind. You can discuss it with Ding Bo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo promptly raised his hand, \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here. I was just doing a big of negotiation with the British media!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang\u2019s expression: I\u2019m so tired \uff08\uffe3\uffe3\uff09\u201d.</p><br/><p>At this point, the long tail of the sunset was just about to fall beneath the horizon, so the man walked to his dressing room and put on a slim black coat. The solemn black lining made the face that \u2018killed fan girls and dominated the first supermodel position\u2019 look even more beautiful and expensive. In particular, it seemed to be plated with a layer of platinum when the light shone on it.</p><br/><p>Since they were leaving, the three people left the room together.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang\u2019s heart was ashes as he reached the door, but he intended to go downstairs and process everything. However, he had only taken a few steps when he suddenly heard a low and magnetic voice from behind him. \u201cThis door\u2026 ah, is it made in Italy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The agent, who was afraid of chaos, quickly interrupted. \u201cYes, this was privately ordered from Italy! Geez, look at this big footprint! Shen Xiang, how big are your feet, 43? Tsk, look at this crack. Your legs are really fierce. Hey, to repair this\u2026 how much will it cost\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201c\u201c\uff08\u256c\uffe3\uffe3\uff09\uff01\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo! Don\u2019t let me see your smug face anytime soon!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t come to me for help when you are being bullied by Xi Ze\u2019s sharp tongue!!!</p><br/><p>No!</p><br/><p>You will definitely come to me later, and I absolutely won\u2019t help!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was naturally unaware of what was happening at the top of the Muse building. When Zhao Rui first found Xi Ze\u2019s Weibo, don\u2019t even talk about him, even Ming Yu and Luo Ru were very chocked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui kept thinking about Xi Ze\u2019s purpose, while Luo Ru was distracted by the fact that something happened that couldn\u2019t be understood. How could such a strange thing happen?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu also squinted for a moment, unable to come up with a reasonable answer.</p><br/><p>Finally, Luo Ru tentatively asked, \u201cPerhaps Director Shen asked Xi Ze for help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui clapped his hands, \u201cYes! That must be it!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like the most likely answer for today\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the three people no longer thought about it. The sky was gradually darkening, so they decided to leave first.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui completely accepted Luo Ru\u2019s speculation. Luo Ru herself felt like it was unlikely for Shen Xiang to do such a move, but she could only accept this answer in the absence of other options. As for Ming Yu\u2026</p><br/><p>The youth looked at his reflection in the elevator door and pondered for a long time. He suddenly recalled the scene a few months ago when he first met the man at Ruoshang Hall.</p><br/><p>Three or four months had passed since Ming Yu was reborn, and he had only seen Xi Ze twice. The first time was when he was forced to hide in the bathroom, while the second time was when he faced \u2018bullying.\u2019</p><br/><p>Both times, his state wasn\u2019t very good.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems\u2026 like I am being bullied?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yu, what did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing Brother Zhao. I didn\u2019t say anything. I just casually remembered a few sentences.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was no longer suspicious after receiving the answer, while Ming Yu continued to ponder on his guess.</p><br/><p>The first possibility: Xi Ze had a very good heart and was helping the newcomers. He was this century\u2019s new Lei Feng.</p><br/><p>New Lei Feng\u2026 Don\u2019t talk about anyone else, even Ming Yu didn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>The second possibility: Xi Ze was making an attempt at him and this attempt\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014Impossible, he was just a rookie. What could Xi Ze want from him?</p><br/><p>The third possibility: Xi Ze appreciated him and thought he really had the potential to surpass Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled lightly and accepted this answer. At this moment, the trio arrived at Muse\u2019s underground parking lot via the elevator.</p><br/><p>The three people were just walking out of the elevator when they heard someone shouting from behind them. \u201cHaha, if it isn\u2019t Zhao Rui? And next to you are Ming Yu and Luo Ru?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu turned first and saw Muse\u2019s ace agent, Ding Bo coming towards them.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Ding Bo could shout Luo Ru\u2019s name so accurately\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui laughed and asked, \u201cDing Bo, today you are finishing work early?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo slowly approached and waved his hand. \u201cThat isn\u2019t it. I accompanied that person in working overtime for a month. Now things are over, so I can temporarily take a break. Ah yes, Ming Yu, your momentum in the past two days isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Ding Bo turned to Ming Yu and continued, \u201cYour performance is very good. Shen Xiang is planning to raise your level of concern to the highest level!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui and Luo Ru who had an understanding of the highest level, \u201c!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The totally ignorant Ming Yu, \u201cThen I would like to thank Director Shen. ^\uff3f^\u201d</p><br/><p>The four people talked as they walked through the parking lot. After chatting for a while, Zhao Rui suddenly had a though. \u201cDing Bo, you said you finally managed to deal with things, were you working alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu also looked at Ding Bo with some curiosity after hearing Zhao Rui\u2019s question. Logically speaking, as Xi Ze\u2019s agent, Ding Bo shouldn\u2019t be alone in his one month of overtime. Was Xi She left in the office?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought this and also curiously asked, \u201cAre you along, Brother Ding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was slightly surprised and about to say something, when he suddenly looked behind Ming Yu and closed his mouth. Then he smiled.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at Ding Bo\u2019s mysterious smile and suddenly had a flash. But just as he was about to grab onto that epiphany, he heard a low and elegant from behind him, \u201cApart from him, there is also me.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In other words, before inviting Ming Yu to become his model, Xi Ze had already known about Ming Yu and Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>What type of situation would allow a model to pass over their own opportunities and even take the initiative to recommend the other person?</p><br/><p>The matter between the original owner and Cheng Su was a block of transparent glass that didn\u2019t deceive anyone!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t know about it before because the shadow of the original owner didn\u2019t cross his eyes. Even the so-called first-tier Cheng Su couldn\u2019t leave an impression on Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>But now, he knew.</p><br/><p>In Ming Yu\u2019s heart, there wasn\u2019t anything like \u2018Ah, I was caught cheating\u2019 or \u2018God Xi knows about the matter between the original owner and Cheng Su.\u2019 He just grabbed another small crab and replied calmly, \u201cAh, it is him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was slightly surprised by the youth\u2019s reaction. After a moment, he whispered, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t elaborate, but Ming Yu understood his meaning.</p><br/><p>How did he feel?</p><br/><p>Was he asking how Ming Yu felt about recording a show with Cheng Su? Or did he have any strange feelings when recording a show with Cheng Su? Was he so sad that he didn\u2019t want to record a show with Cheng Su?</p><br/><p>The above feelings, Ming Xiaoyu felt none of them.</p><br/><p>He suddenly remembered something and asked, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. By the way Xi Ze, as a friend, can you tell me something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s low voice was heard from the phone. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu estimated that this matter wasn\u2019t important to Xi Ze, but Xi Ze would certainly know it. Thus, he asked without hesitation. \u201cNext week, the March world\u2019s supermodel ranking will come out. Can you tell me if Cheng Su is on the list?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a short pause before Xi Ze asked, \u201cDo you think that Cheng Su has now become a supermodel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was stunned and replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, Ming Yu heard Xi Ze take out another phone and dialled Shen Xiang\u2019s number.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t pay attention to Cheng Su\u2019s news, but Shen Xiang wasn\u2019t the same. Shen Xiang knew the basic information and recent news of every model in Muse.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze put the call on loudspeaker and Ming Yu heard Shen Xiang saying, \u201cZeng Shu has won many good resources for him. He only shot the publicity photos for Rayleigh Cano this month. The set of ads will go online in the next two months. Therefore, the supermodel organization plans to add his name to the list in two months. He isn\u2019t a supermodel yet, but he can be called top of the line. Eh, why are you suddenly asking about this? Are you concerned about Cheng Su because of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been hard for you. Rest well, goodnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t give Shen Xiang an opportunity to respond and hurriedly hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ming Yu raised an eyebrow at Xi Ze\u2019s behaviour, but didn\u2019t ask about it. After carefully thinking, he spoke, \u201cCheng Su needs two more months before he can become a supermodel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze nodded. \u201cYes, Shen Xiang shouldn\u2019t be wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s supermodel rankings listed 100 of the top male and female models, for a total of 200 people.</p><br/><p>But how many supermodels were there in the world?</p><br/><p>367 people.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought silently.</p><br/><p>A long time ago, the industry selected the best models in the world through a supermodel contest and gave them the title of the best models. This name later became supermodels.</p><br/><p>Later, once the fashion industry became more prosperous, many top industry professionals set up a group called the \u2018World Supermodels Organization\u2019, publishing the world\u2019s supermodel rankings every three months in order to announce the current fashion trends and status of the models.</p><br/><p>The people qualified to become a supermodel were determined by the World Supermodels Organization. They published a supermodel list every month, conducting a complete data analysis on the model\u2019s endorsements, salaries, fashion shows and magazine photos in the past 12 months.</p><br/><p>Once Cheng Su became the global spokesperson for the second-tier brand Rayleigh Cano, he was finally qualified to enter the list of 300 people. But before he joined, it was unknown if he would step into the top 100 world\u2019s supermodels list.</p><br/><p>Anyway, in the March 2017 world supermodel rankings, Cheng Su didn\u2019t have a chance.</p><br/><p>With this in mind, Ming Yu didn\u2019t care about the man any further. He chatted casually with Xi Ze for a few more minutes before seeing Luo Ru and Zhao Rui in the distance. He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to hang up.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xi Ze calmly asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t like him anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s tone was very low-key, as if it was a casual question where he didn\u2019t care about the answer.</p><br/><p>But Ming Yu stopped short, standing silently on the beat with a small bucket full of crabs in his hands.</p><br/><p>The sinking sun set a long shadow over the vast sea. The waves reflected blue purple, reddish orange and white rays of light as it constantly fluctuated.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu remained silent and Xi Ze didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>As a group of seagulls glided through the sea and the shrill cry of birds broke the silence, Ming Yu opened his mouth and said, \u201cThe previous things, they were all the actions of a child. At that time, I was too young and it was easy to become confused. Now\u2026 I\u2019ve grown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a long pause before low laughter was heard from the phone. Xi Ze softly replied, \u201cHrmm. I remember that April is your birthday. Then he added, \u201cIt is the birthday of an 18 year old adult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu started walking forward again and nodded, \u201cYes, it is the birthday of an 18 year old adult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs your friend, I will send you an adult gift so that you can become a mature and calm adult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Ze\u2019s gift? I am looking forward to it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The two had a short moment of exchance before Ming Yu hung up the phone. Then he walked up to Zhao Rui and Lu Ruo. Luo Ru and Zhao Rui had been looking for crabs. This time, Ming Yu found a lot so they returned to the hotel.</p><br/><p>Neither Zhao Rui or Luo Ru could find any anomalies in Ming Yu, but they didn\u2019t know that he had received a phone call.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were eating crabs that night and MIng Yu was still frowning that Zhao Rui asked curiously, \u201cXiaoyu, what\u2019s wrong with you? I didn\u2019t see you smile after returning from the beach. What are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Zhao Rui\u2019s words, Ming Yu raised his lips and revealed an easy smile. \u201cIt is nothing Brother Zhao. It is my first time coming here and I haven\u2019t adapted to the sea breeze. I will rest early this evening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui heard this explanation and ordered Ming Yu to have a good rest. He would be recording the program the day after tomorrow, so he must be careful. Meanwhile, Luo Ru quietly observed Ming Yu for a long time. She found that the youth had returned to his normal demeanor. Although her heart felt a bit strange, she didn\u2019t say anything more.</p><br/><p>Was Ming Xiaoyu worried about Cheng Su?</p><br/><p>You are too naive!</p><br/><p>In Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s heart, Cheng Su had never been a problem. Ming Xiaoyu believed that Cheng Su was indeed powerful, but could he be counted as an excellent supermodel? For at least half a year, as long as no pie fell from the sky, he would barely be considered a supermodel.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su would come to the island tomorrow for the recording?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t a problem!</p><br/><p>When the two people had met, Cheng Su was the only one who responded badly. Ming Xiaoyu had no feelings. \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d In the end, what did MIng Xiaoyu have to be worried about?</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t like him anymore?</p><br/><p>At that time, he was too young. Now he was grown up.</p><br/><p>This was the answer that Ming Yu hesitated over before finally giving.</p><br/><p>The sentence was really ambiguous and seemed to imply that he had been ignorant and confused. Now, every decision he made was serious and sincere. If he liked someone, this was also heartfelt, true and sincere.</p><br/><p>This answer was already the most positive response that Ming Yu gave to Xi Ze in recent months. But Xi Ze didn\u2019t linger on this issue and Ming Yu didn\u2019t say anything other than his answer.</p><br/><p>The two people knowingly swept away this type, Xi Ze for a reason that Ming Yu didn\u2019t know. For Ming Yu, he didn\u2019t really understand what he was feeling in the end. He was confused and embarrassed, so he decided to wait and see.</p><br/><p>In Ming Yu\u2019s last life, he had only lived until the age of 25. Before the age of 23, he was busy making a living and slowly become the world\u2019s top supermodel. By the time he was 24, he was already suffering from that damn illness and spent the last year in bed.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu never really felt love towards anyone in his past life. His eyes were always so high up that a friend once commented, \u201cYou aren\u2019t narcissistic like Narcissus, right? You don\u2019t like yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t narcissist to that extent. Now that he had a good impression of that man?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu deeply considered if this was goodwill towards the man or something inexplicable. Well, let\u2019s watch and see.</p><hr/><br/><p>TL Note: For those who might be confused, there are two lists. One is the top 100 male and top 100 female supermodels which is published every three months. The other one is all the supermodels and this is published every month</p><br/>\n</div>"}

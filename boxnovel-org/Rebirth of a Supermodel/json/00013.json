However, the other person had lowered his attitude to this extent so Liu Qian didn\u2019t deliberately make things difficult. He glanced at Ming Yu, who smiled lightly and gave him a reassuring look. Therefore, Liu Qian left with a \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shooting location that Character chose today was a holiday villa on the eastern outskirts of Beijing. The blue and cloudless sky, mountain on one side and water on the other and the lush vegetation made the villa a rare beauty in Beijing.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had actually noticed Zhu Wei before he came. He had to admit that Zhu Wei was truly a handsome and tall male model. But from Ming Yu\u2019s point of view, Zhu Wei\u2019s future path would be narrow if he didn\u2019t change his temperament.</p><br/><p>Of course, this didn\u2019t mean that Ming Yu felt compassion towards Zhu Wei. The handsome and elegant young man smiled and asked, \u201cWhy are you looking for me, Zhu Wei? The make-up people are already in place and will soon begin, so what is so urgent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s tone was as calm as always, not showing any likes or dislikes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei stared at Ming Yu for a while, then suddenly bowed. \u201cMing Yu, I came to apologize to you! Our encounter in Fashion Entertainment was really my fault, then I asked my friend to suppress your photo. I did many wrong things, I really regret it now! Thinking about it now, I really feel like a villain! I should compete with you with strength, not do these crooked things! Ming Yu, I implore you to forgive me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help making a startled expression as Zhu Wei bowed and apologized.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t loud, but his bowing appearance could be seen by everyone on the scene. Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian were staring with astonishment from not far away, while Zhao Rui was ready to come over and see what was going on.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei suddenly bowed to Ming Yu?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t there a conflict between them?</p><br/><p>The thought \u2018Ming Yu is bullying Zhu Wei\u2019 appeared in the minds of some staff members. Then Ming Yu suddenly stepped forward, raising a hand towards the apologetic Zhu Wei and said mildly, \u201cZhu Wei, I don\u2019t blame you. I don\u2019t care about things in the past, so you don\u2019t have to do such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s voice was modest but it spread throughout the area, letting some of the staff members having crooked thoughts realize what happened.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei made an amazed expression, \u201cYou will really forgive me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the bright sunshine, the young face showed a brilliant smile. Ming Yu\u2019s eyes curved as he looked at Zhu Wei, but his eyes were dark. He laughed, \u201cI never blamed you so how can I forgive you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei replied urgently, \u201cYou must forgive me Ming Yu! I really want things to be good between us! I will show you with my actions!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was speechless at the words. His eyes slightly sank and his smile became slightly more brilliant.</p><br/><p>For the rest of the day, Zhu Wei used actions to prove to Ming Yu that he really wanted to be friends.</p><br/><p>For example, when applying the make-up, Zhu Wei took the initiative to choose a dressing room next to Ming Yu and also gave the first chance of make-up to Ming Yu. Another example was when Brother Luo wanted two people in the shoot. Zhu Wei volunteered to be in Ming Yu\u2019s group and took it seriously, passing on his considerable experience in front of the camera to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>When everyone was eating together at noon, Zhu Wei took the initiative to eat at the same table with Ming Yu, chatting with him about recent news. He also revealed some of his next itinerary to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>This was the act of getting to know each other as friends and even repenting.</p><br/><p>Finally, Zhu Wei went to take photos and Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian walked up quickly. Liu Qian looked at Zhu Wei taking photos not far away and said emotionally, \u201cAt first, I thought that guy was faking. However, Zhu Wei\u2019s temperament has really gone through a big change in one day! The typesetting news that caused an uproar in the fashion circles for two days must\u2019ve hit him really hard, causing him to change? But this is a really good change. If I knew that this kid could become better after being hit, I would\u2019ve done it earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian knew about \u2018Fashion Entertainment\u2019s typesetting event\u2019. This morning they had congratulated Ming Yu, as he had been blessed by a disaster. Naturally, they knew that Zhu Wei was the other protagonist of the typesetting incident.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled while listening to Liu Qian\u2019s words and didn\u2019t saw anything.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Wu Yuzhen gazed at Zhu Wei for a long time. He hesitated for a moment before turning to Ming Yu. He said, \u201cMing Yu, I once encountered something interesting on a photo shoot in the UK.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t speak and Liu Qian asked curiously, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen explained calmly, \u201cThe location I was shooting at had bad weather, so we stopped temporarily. I was bored and playing on my phone, while I suddenly saw an ant pushing a bug.\u201d Zhu Wei continued, \u201cAs you know, ants are Hercules and they can lift 60 times their own mass. So, when I saw an ant pushing a bug that was 100 times its own mass, I was curious and continued to watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not far away, Zhu Wei had started on his last shots. Wu Yuzhen continued with a smile, \u201cThe way I saw it, this bug was too big and the ant wouldn\u2019t be able to push it more than two centimetres. I watched it move around the bug several times before leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Qian interrupted, \u201cDid it give up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen smiled and shook his head. \u201cI also thought that it gave up at first. But after five minutes passed, I saw a large group of ants suddenly emerge and move the bug together. Okay, I\u2019m done. Isn\u2019t it interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Qian glared at him. \u201cSo dense\u2026 this is disgusting. Your story wasn\u2019t interesting at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen didn\u2019t care about the mocking of his friend. He just turned to Ming Yu and asked with deep eyes, \u201cMing Yu, do you think this story is interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man calmly raised the corners of his lips and said, \u201cIndeed\u2026 it is very interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen and Ming Yu smiled at each other, causing Liu Qian to feel dismay. However, Zhu Wei came over at this moment and Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian went to shoot their own photos. Zhu Wei was still \u2018dedicated\u2019 to Ming Yu, causing a few staff members to think \u2018Zhu Wei is chasing after Ming Yu.\u2019</p><br/><p>The location shooting ended in the end and everyone was about to leave, when Zhu Wei suddenly proposed. \u201cI know a good clubhouse nearby. We are tired from today\u2019s shooting, so why don\u2019t we go there for a meal and celebrate the shoot ending?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Luo responded first, \u201cAre you talking about Ruoshang Hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei nodded. \u201cYes, Brother Luo, it is Ruoshang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Luo replied, \u201cThe food is great but entering is somewhat inconvenient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui immediately cried out, \u201cI have a friend who is familiar with the manager. It is still the off-season, so I should be able to get a table!\u201d</p><br/><p>Many people became excited at Zhu Wei\u2019s words. Ruoshang was a clubhouse opened by a well-known designer that many people in these circles knew. The interior decorations were fashionable and the dishes were widely acclaimed.</p><br/><p>Since Zhu Wei had a way in, everyone naturally wanted to try it. Anyway, now they had consumed \u2018Character\u2019s public funds and they took photos all day, so couldn\u2019t they enjoy a little dinner?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t too late and once Zhu Wei confirmed that they got good seats, the group headed there.</p><br/><p>Among the crowd, Zhao Rui happily introduced the classic dishes of Ruoshang to Ming Yu, while Ming Yu listened with a smile.</p><br/><p>After everyone entered the hall, they sat down and enjoyed three rounds of drinks. Apart from Liu Qian who was allergic to alcohol, everyone turned red as they drank, even the minor Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei sat next to Ming Yu and kept giving him alcohol. Seeing Zhu Wei looking at him while raising the glass, Ming Yu\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed. He took advantage of the opening to stand up and say with a laugh, \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room was busy eating and drinking. Zhao Rui was the only one who said to be carefully and then Ming Yu finally left the loud atmosphere of the room.</p><br/><p>It was finally quiet, so Ming Yu sighed gently and raised a hand to his hot cheeks.</p><br/><p>He was still a minor but he had also drunk red wine. It was only a few glasses of red wine, but his face turned hot and his head became dizzy.</p><br/><p>In these circumstances, Ming Yu sensibly decided to go out and sober up his mind.</p><br/><p>However, his quiet time only lasted a moment. Ming Yu hadn\u2019t even reached the corner of the corridor when he heard a male voice shouting from behind him. \u201cMing Yu, wait for me! I have to go to the bathroom as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sobered up in an instant and subconsciously increased his pace, ignoring Zhu Wei\u2019s cry from behind him. However, Zhu Wei also accelerated his pace, like a beast chasing after his prey to swallow him.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu turned left, Zhu Wei turned left. Ming Yu turned right, Zhu Wei turned right.</p><br/><p>The two people passed several signs indicating the bathroom, but no one entered. Ming Yu headed deeply inside the hall, while Zhu Wei was less than 10 metres behind him.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s sharp intuition didn\u2019t allow him to slow down. Then he saw a \u2018repair\u2019 sign hanging from a bathroom door and he didn\u2019t hesitate to push open the door, locking it behind him.</p><br/><p>It was a bright and luxurious bathroom with no foul smell, just a faint fragrance. The tall teenager leaned against the door and gently panted. His crimson face and bright eyes made his beauty more exquisite and he looked seductive.</p><br/><p>The tricking of water sounded in the quiet room.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sighed with relief when he heard Zhu Wei\u2019s footsteps hurrying past the door, then found the strange water sound in the room. He glanced up in amazement and saw the man washing his hands at the sink.</p><br/><p>The golden light shone on the man\u2019s black hair, making it look covered in a layer of gold. The handsome three-dimensional features and strong oppressive aura meant that even standing in this ordinary place, the man\u2019s temperament didn\u2019t diminish at all. In fact, it he made the mediocre environment look even worse!</p><br/><p>He was completely absorbed in washing his hands, from his fingernails to the raised bones on his hands. The white jade hand under the water were clearly clean without any signs of dirt, but the man was still cleaning in a paranoid manner.</p><br/><p>In the quiet bathroom, the dazed Ming Yu stared at the man in front of him without saying a word.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

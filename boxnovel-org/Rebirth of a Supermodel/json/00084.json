The kiss started very suddenly but lasted a long time. It seemed that neither of them wanted to leave the other. Sometimes they wanted to possess the other person with their aggressiveness.</p><br/><p>In the quiet cloakroom, the long kiss ended. The tall and thin young man gasped as he looked at the man in front of him. His cheeks were red and his eyes were bright and clear as he stared into the man\u2019s eyes. Seeing this, the latter couldn\u2019t help squinting.</p><br/><p>The two people stared at each other as their foreheads touched. Then Ming Yu took the initiative to raise his mouth and kiss Xi Ze\u2019s lips. He dropped a soft kiss before his lips curved and he said, \u201cBefore today, I really couldn\u2019t believe that you can cook.\u201d Then he added, \u201cYou also do it so well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze glanced at the young man\u2019s swollen lips and raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu admitted it. \u201cI like it very much. I was thinking that whoever marries you would win a big profit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s dark eyes flashed as he listened to the youth\u2019s words. He smiled and said, \u201cIt will be the same when we marry.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was extremely low and Ming Yu didn\u2019t hear it. When he asked again, Xi Ze chose not to answer. Ming Yu didn\u2019t think too much about it. He simply believed that \u2018This man must\u2019ve said something that can\u2019t be spoken.\u2019</p><br/><p>No one mentioned the kiss, but when Ming Yu changed clothes, Xi Ze didn\u2019t leave this time. He took the initiative to help the youth. After all, the clothing was very precious and needed to be well preserved.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze helped Ming Yu carefully place it in the box and the two people walked downstairs together.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu suddenly had a thought. \u201cHow much is this outfit worth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips curved. \u201cDo you want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man replied positively and Xi Ze opened his hands and said with resignation, \u201cIt is priceless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze sincerely added. \u201cThis is a separate design for my muse. It is the only one in the world and is naturally priceless.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to him, Ming Yu uttered a light hum. \u201cOh, there is only one? You designed it for me? Who was the person who said that maybe I can see the same series of women\u2019s clothing in the next Ji and Ya high-end fashion show?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu never expected that in the face of his doubts and condemnation, Xi Ze actually made a look of astonishment. \u201cThere was such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression was shocked and his sharp eyes were slightly raised, as if he had absolutely no idea.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was amused by his expression. He raised a hand to hit Xi Ze\u2019s chest and said, \u201cI can already imagine it, what Ding Bo and Director Shen have to live with every day. You are really shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Ding Bo and Shen Xiang: Small Mushroom, gj!!! o\uff08*\u2267\u25bd\u2266\uff09\u30c4</p><br/><p>Xi Ze helplessly shook his head with an expression of \u2018how can you slander me?\u2019 Then he sighed. \u201cYou really can\u2019t imagine their days because they will never talk to me like you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu opened his door and Xi Ze placed a hand on the door frame, intending to step in. However, his feet had just lifted up, it wasn\u2019t even completely off the ground, when Ming Yu suddenly turned around and asked, \u201cIs there another matter today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze jerked and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man held the door and said with a smile, \u201cIt is quite late now. I have a job tomorrow and I heard that you\u2019ve been very busy lately. Go back and rest. I won\u2019t send you away. After all, your apartment is upstairs and it will only take a few steps.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s brows slightly narrowed together as his eyes stared at the youth. It lingered a long time on the youth\u2019s glossy lips. The lips were slightly red and swollen. Xi Ze clearly remember the feeling of the lips, which was soft and delicate, more delicate than the finest silk.</p><br/><p>As if aware of where Xi Ze was looking, Ming Yu gave a low laugh. He reached out so suddenly that Xi Ze couldn\u2019t react and pulled him down slightly. Then while Xi Ze was still surprised, he lightly pressed his lips against Xi Ze\u2019s lips and said, \u201cA good night kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next second, Xi Ze laughed lightly. \u201cYou are very active today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu ignored the man\u2019s flirtation. Instead, he thought for a moment before saying seriously, \u201cSince you think I am too active, I won\u2019t take the initiative\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze directly blocked the youth\u2019s mouth. He once again hugged Ming Yu\u2019s waist, bowed his head and gave another kiss.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu hadn\u2019t been expecting it. After a moment, he slowly responded.</p><br/><p>Standing in front of the half open door, the two men didn\u2019t seem to care about being seen as they kissed earnestly and sincerely. The man swiftly sucked at the youth\u2019s hot lips, their tongues tangling together. The noise that was made was beautiful and shameful.</p><br/><p>The first time Ming Yu saw XI Ze\u2019s name was the day he first came to this world.</p><br/><p>After going to the hospital to check his body\u2019s condition and returning home, the first thing Ming Yu did was to check who was the world\u2019s number one supermodel. To his surprise, the man in the photo was a handsome and noble Huaxia person.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu still remembered the photo he saw at that time. Xi Ze had raised his hand to cover the left side of his face. The dazzling phoenix eyes seemed to penetrate through the screen. It was a black and white photo, which made the man\u2019s facial features more beautiful.</p><br/><p>From that moment onwards, Ming Yu remembered this person and imprinted the name deeply in his heart.</p><br/><p>Now he was kissing this man. Unlike what he had imagined, Xi Ze\u2019s lips were hot, not as cold and indifferent as he looked.</p><br/><p>Once the kiss was over, Ming Yu panted slightly as he listened to Xi Ze\u2019s whisper. \u201cHappy birthday, this is my good night kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu really didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry at these words. \u201cYou should hurry and go upstairs, Mr. Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mingxiao\u2019s 18th birthday ended with a hot late night kiss. He got gifts that covered the whole coffee table, the blessings of many friends, high-end clothing and finally\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, it seemed like putting the man together with these precious gifts was too inappropriate. Ming Yu shook his head and decided to treat a certain man and his kisses as gifts that came along with the high-end clothing.</p><br/><p>He thought like this, but once Ming Xiaoyu saw the text sent by the man before going to bed, he couldn\u2019t help smiling. His eyes curved as he replied: \u3010 Mr. Xi, it is midnight. Don\u2019t you know that disturbing a person\u2019s dreams is a very shameless thing to do? \u3011</p><br/><p>After a long time, Mr. Xi, who disturbed his dream, sent a message back:\u3010 Should I use a good night kiss as compensation? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 \u2026Go to sleep, ?\uff3f? \u3011</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next day, Ming Yu woke up early. The day hadn\u2019t even become light yet by the time his grooming was completed and he went downstairs to Luo Ru\u2019s car.</p><br/><p>The car had been driving for half an hour when Ming Yu suddenly received a message from Xi Ze. \u3010 You\u2019re not at home? \u3011</p><br/><p>Through these simple words, Ming Xiaoyu seemed to see the man\u2019s depressed expression.</p><br/><p>He was the culprit of last night\u2019s disturbing dream. Ming Xiaoyu smiled and replied: \u3010 Mr. XI, don\u2019t you know this sentence? Go to sleep early and get up early. I have already left the fourth ring of the capital. This is a good time, you shouldn\u2019t waste it Mr. Xi. \u3011</p><br/><p>The man seemed to be aware that the youth\u2019s text message was ridiculing him. Standing in front of the mahogany door, Xi Ze first looked at the short message before heading into the elevator and replying:\u3010 I originally wanted to say that your favourite crystal mushroom necklace fell in my cloakroom and I planned to return it to you today. But looking at this situation\u2026 I will return it to you personally when you arrive at the company. \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu who opened the phone and saw the message, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>Who loved that necklace? Who loved it?</p><br/><p>He hurriedly replied with \u2018I will look for you in the capital\u2019 and immediately closed the phone. He had been teased by this man in a short time and didn\u2019t want to support him anymore.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Luo Ru looked at Ming Yu through the rearview mirror. Ming Xiaoyu might look calm, but somehow Luo Ru thought he felt different. After thinking for a moment, Luo Ru asked, \u201cXiaoyu, is something wrong? Didn\u2019t you sleep well last night? You don\u2019t seem to be in a good mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and said calmly, \u201cSister Luo, I slept well last night. Thank you for celebrating my birthday yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru didn\u2019t think much of it and laughed. \u201cIt is your birthday, everyone was happy. I didn\u2019t expect Old Fei to come yesterday, it really surprised me. It seems that Old Fei likes you quite a lot Xiaoyu. Ah right, Fei Sixin talked to me last night about another gathering at night. But you have a job today. Otherwise, it would\u2019ve been nice to go to the gathering in the evening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu listened to this and nodded silently, but he inwardly thought\u2014</p><br/><p>If there had been another gathering yesterday night, he wouldn\u2019t have become caught up with that man. Somehow, their relationship had been made clear?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought about it for a moment. Last night, what was he thinking when he took the initiative to kiss that man? Well, it was the moon\u2019s fault! It must be because the moon made the atmosphere too good last night!</p><br/><p>The moon that was obscured by dark clouds last night: ==\uff01</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu arrived at the shooting location, the Nidelan people had been here for a long time.</p><br/><p>The deputy director saw Ming Yu and Luo Ru and hurriedly led them into the venue. Then he said, \u201cMing Yu, you have finally arrived. Director Xu arrived at the studio today and seems a bit dissatisfied with the equipment. Please be patient and wait a while. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

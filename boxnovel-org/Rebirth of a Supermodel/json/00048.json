No one deliberately spoke about this issue, but in the invisible background, the company was allocating more and more resources to Ming Yu. In the media coverage, they tried their utmost to safeguard Ming Yu\u2019s image.</p><br/><p>But this time, becoming the Huaxia spokesperson for \u2018Nidelan\u2019 wasn\u2019t a company resource.</p><br/><p>In the six months since he met Zhao Rui, Ming Yu often gave him verbal supervision and encouragement. He wanted to see Zhao Rui grow into a good agent.</p><br/><p>He might not have 90 points or full marks like Zeng Shu and Ding Bo, but Ming Yu hoped that Zhao Rui could get a good grade of 80 points.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Rui truly had made progress.</p><br/><p>In Zhao Rui\u2019s prime, he had two first-tier models, two popular second-tier models who later transitioned to become actors and even quit Muse, as well as\u2026 Cheng Su who recently became a global spokesperson for a big second-tier brand.</p><br/><p>In short, now Zhao Rui only had Ming Yu under him. If he didn\u2019t show any progress, then his slide downhill was irreversible.</p><br/><p>Before Ming Yu participated in Fei Sixin\u2019s fashion show, Zhao Rui spent half a month and finally won Nidelan\u2019s Huaxia spokesperson job.</p><br/><p>At that time, Ming Yu\u2019s career had only slightly improved. He only participated in the photo shoot of two magazines and took part in the Pei Feng fashion show. He might\u2019ve shot the cover of Meditation Road, but it would only be released at the end of January as a special issue.</p><br/><p>In this case, Zhao Rui won the job over many competitors, making Ming Yu feel surprised.</p><br/><p>Nidelan was an internationally renowned first-tier luxury brand. They were mainly a makeup brand, including a variety of skin care products, cosmetics and perfumes. The contract signed by Ming Yu was to be their Huaxia spokesperson for a series of men\u2019s fragrances that would be released next year.</p><br/><p>Thus, the day after his break finished, Ming Yu, Zhao Rui and Luo Ru arrived at Nidelan\u2019s Huaxia headquarters in the capital and signed the one year contract.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s writing\u2026 it was like it was written by a dog. But when he signed the word \u2018Ming Yu\u2019, it was amazing, causing the head of Nidelan to feel stunned. He laughed and praised, \u201cMr. Ming, your handwriting is really nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled calmly and said, \u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the formal signing of the contract, Ming Yu went to the Nidelan stylist to prepare for the posters that would be shot tomorrow. The stylist was obviously very good at designing for an Eastern face like Ming Yu. Soon, the stylist finished cutting a little bit of Ming Yu\u2019s hair, giving him a good hairstyle.</p><br/><p>The stylist wasn\u2019t a problem, but the makeup artist of Nidelan didn\u2019t fit well with Ming Yu. The male makeup artist from the United States tried three different makeups on Ming Yu, but he always felt they were a bit wrong. Ming Yu didn\u2019t need an explanation as even he looked at himself with a frown.</p><br/><p>The makeup artist said that he might be in a bad condition and he could try again tomorrow. Then Luo Ru interrupted and asked, \u201cExcuse me, can we bring our own private makeup artist?\u201d</p><br/><p>The makeup artist was surprised for a moment, before agreeing with a smile. \u201cNo problem. A private makeup artist will be most familiar with your face. They also know the style suitable for you. If you have a private makeup artist, then that is the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under Ming Yu\u2019s thoughtful gaze, Luo Ru lightly nodded and agreed with the makeup artist.</p><br/><p>After finishing up for today, since the posters would be shot tomorrow, the three people headed to the parking lot. Then Zhao Rui asked, \u201cLittle Luo, I gave you the task of finding a private makeup artist last month. Did you find one so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru nodded with a relaxed smile. \u201cYes Brother Zhao. I confirmed it with the other person two days ago. She had to do some procedures to leave her current position, but she should be able to join us tomorrow. You have been very busy lately, so I submitted the matter directly to the higher-ups. Through Zhou Wei Zhuo, the company agreed to the makeup artist, as well as her salary standards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui jerked with surprise and asked, \u201cYou spoke with A\u2019Wei? A\u2019Wei didn\u2019t tell me anything. Who is this makeup artist? What is her salary standard, is it high? You need to report it to A\u2019Wei.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, he didn\u2019t wait for Luo Ru to speak. The youth\u2019s pleasant voice rang out. \u201cIs it Sister Zheng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru swallowed down the words she wanted to say and looked over at Ming Yu with surprise. She saw that this beautiful youth was calmly watching her, a deep look in his light coloured eyes. Luo Ru slowly stopped walking.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui looked back at her with confusion and asked what happened. Luo Ru recovered and continued speaking. \u201cYes, it is Sister Zheng. Last time I gave her my business card. She added me as a friend and we have been in contact. When Brother Zhao asked me to find a private makeup artist, I first thought of her. But Sister Zheng works for Pei Feng and her salary isn\u2019t low. I put in a lot of effort to persuade her, promising her the salary of a Muse first-tier makeup artist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru spoke simply, but the difficulty of persuading a makeup artist with a steady job couldn\u2019t be imagined.</p><br/><p>The trio talked while walking. Zhao Rui listened to Luo Ru\u2019s explanation and nodded. \u201cIs it the makeup artist who worked on Ming Yu during the Pei Feng fashion show? I remember her way very well! The mole she placed was really ingenious. She deserves the salary of a first-tier makeup artist. Her strength is good\u2026 Wait a minute? The salary of a first-tier makeup artist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui looked aghast at Luo Ru, who nodded. \u201cYes, it is the salary and status of a first-tier makeup artist.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three people took a few steps, with Zhao Rui still feeling shocked. He asked, \u201cThis thing\u2026 A\u2019Wei really agreed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru helplessly replied, \u201cYes Brother Zhao. Sister Wei really agreed to this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three people got on the car, but Zhao Rui still thought it was abnormal. He sighed, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right. The company\u2019s first-tier models generally don\u2019t have their own private first-tier makeup artists. How can A\u2019Wei promise such generous treatment? You don\u2019t have to worry too much. I will call A\u2019Wei later and ask her about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui said this and started to drive intently. The car was quiet and tranquil, with only the faint whistling of the wind through the window being heard. Ming Yu sat behind the driver\u2019s seat and calmly bowed his head over his phone.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu realized Zhao Rui\u2019s confusion, but he didn\u2019t mind it too much.</p><br/><p>First-tier models didn\u2019t have private first-tier makeup artists because the company believed that they wouldn\u2019t be able to climb up higher. He was granted a first-tier makeup artist, indicating that the company valued him.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Ming Yu slightly narrowed his eyes and stopped looking through the fan comments.</p><br/><p>So, what was his current level of interest in the company?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t know that at this very moment, in the public relations department of Muse, all the staff were hurrying back and forth. Everyone was busy, with disputes and lively discussions often being heard.</p><br/><p>Muse had hundreds of models and the PR department had more than 200 employees. Even so, the 200 employees were unable to properly handle things for every model, often leading to friction and controversy.</p><br/><p>However, this time, the controversy was something different. Linda, the deputy director of the PR department, discovered that Zhou Wei Zhuo had granted a first-tier makeup artist to Ming Yu. She immediately called Zhou Wei Zhuo and asked about the matter.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo picked up the phone, knowing Linda\u2019s purpose. She told her, \u201cThis is a matter that Shen Xiang agreed to. Linda, talk to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, at this moment, Linda came to PR Director Shen Xiang\u2019s office to ask him about this error.</p><br/><p>Two or three months ago, the PR department\u2019s senior officials had a meeting and decided to raise Ming Yu\u2019s level to first-tier. However, this didn\u2019t mean that Ming Yu could have a first-tier makeup artist that most first-tier models didn\u2019t have. This was an overestimation and could lead to public criticism. In Linda\u2019s eyes, there were only disadvantages.</p><br/><p>But Shen Xiang shook his head after listening to his old friend. \u201cYou have been busy with the propaganda of Luo Cheng, so I haven\u2019t had a chance to tell you. Linda, Ming Yu\u2019s present level is no longer first-tier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Linda\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cTop level? It is still too soon for him to have a first-tier makeup artist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang gently shook his head.</p><br/><p>The surprised Linda asked, \u201cIs it above top-tier? He has enough potential to be treated like Luo Cheng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang looked at his old friend\u2019s shocked appearance and smiled, revealing his white teeth. He proudly declared, \u201cOf course it isn\u2019t the top level!\u201d Linda gasped and patted her chest. \u201cFortunately, it isn\u2019t the top\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang, \u201cIt is the highest level!\u201d</p><br/><p>Linda, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She took deep breaths.</p><br/><p>Linda didn\u2019t agree with Ming Yu being raised to the highest level. However, once Shen Xiang said that it was Xi Ze\u2019s choice, she could only temporarily step back. Xi Ze had raised He Chaoman in a year. If he wanted to boost Ming Yu, it would naturally be easy.</p><br/><p>But after walking out of Shen Xiang\u2019s office, Linda suddenly realized. \u201cWait a minute! How can Ming Yu be at the highest level? Does Xi Ze hold Ming Yu to a higher status than He Chaoman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Muse\u2019s elder sister He Chaoman, the second ranked female supermodel.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

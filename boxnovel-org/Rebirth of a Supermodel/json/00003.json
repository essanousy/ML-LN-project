The dressing room towards the rear of the 39th floor had bright lighting and was clean, showing that it clearly had a careful owner. Ming Yu looked at the nameplate on the door\u2014</p><br/><p>Muse\u2019s chief stylist, Zhou Wei Zhuo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI personally think that your style right now is too feminine. Having personality is a good thing, but it will be hard if your personality doesn\u2019t fit the image.\u201d Zhou Wei Zhuo said as he sat Ming Yu in front of a mirror. He looked Ming Yu up and down a few times and asked, \u201cDo you have any thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>When going out, Ming Yu had specifically styled his too long hair in order to make him look less feminine. However, the original appearance really leaned towards femininity. If the person with such a good appearance didn\u2019t have a certain amount of aura about him, it would just turn out to be a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought for a moment before asking, \u201cSister Zhou, can you neatly cut my hair? I want to seem more capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo raised an eyebrow at the words. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled lightly. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo started to move once it was agreed upon. As Muse\u2019s chief stylist, it was reasonable that Zhou Wei Zhuo wouldn\u2019t help such a small model change their image. But at this moment, she took out a flat tooth comb and scissors in order to take care of this handsome young man.</p><br/><p>The scissors went \u2018snip snip\u2019 and the original shoulder length hair was cut by half. Once the hair cut was finished, a beautiful face was uncovered.</p><br/><p>For people with an average appearance, long hair could cover the defects on the face, making it seem more outstanding. But during the hair cut, Zhou Wei Zhuo repeated several times, \u201cWhat do you saying about keeping this long hair? Can\u2019t a weave be put it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said this but after looking at the result of the hair cut, Zhou Wei Zhuo felt startled. In the face of such a handsome man, she couldn\u2019t hide the amazed look in her eyes.</p><br/><p>A long time ago when Ming Yu just debuted, Zhou Wei Zhuo evaluated his face like this: sufficient to be an evildoer.</p><br/><p>At the time, Ming Yu was only 14 years old but he already had an appearance that was different from ordinary people. Now after three years, if someone asked Zhou Wei Zhuo to make an evaluation, she could only say: I have no idea how to describe it.</p><br/><p>Although the body and temperament were also important elements that made up a super model along with appearance, it was hard to find five people with a more impressive face. Zhou Wei Zhuo secretly thought, \u2018If this young man can have some aura around him, he will be\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo\u2019s thoughts suddenly paused.</p><br/><p>The originally sitting youth had stood up. His height of 181cm didn\u2019t make him seem burly. Rather, he stood tall and straight like a pine. She didn\u2019t feel it when he was sitting, but now a sharp and fierce aura was coming from Ming Yu\u2019s light-coloured eyes.</p><br/><p>The brilliant light of the room shone through the clean and clear eyes of the youth.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui stepped forward, muttering \u201cHow is his hair cut?\u201d However, his words slowly trailed off.</p><br/><p>When Ming Yu was discovered by the company, Zhao Rui used a lot of effort before signing him as his model. This face and height of 175cm at only 14 years old, Zhao Rui was confident that this person would become big!</p><br/><p>The other things weren\u2019t worth mentioning, but Zhao Rui thought it was true that the god of luck really made fools of people. Ming Yu had a good face, but that didn\u2019t mean his temperament and heart were comparable. Zhao Rui could only watch as he mixed in with the wrong people and muddled through life.</p><br/><p>And now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you speaking?\u201d The nice and clear voice rang out in the open room, like there was an echo. Ming Yu smiled. \u201cIs my current appearance so bad? I think it is really good. Thank you Sister Zhou. You have really skilled hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo awakened from her blank state at the youth\u2019s respectful but not flattering attitude. She waved her hand and said again, \u201cVery good, very good. Ming Yu, don\u2019t wear your previous clothes any more. Those clothes\u2026they aren\u2019t bad, but this is more suitable for you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help laughing as he said \u201cOkay Sister Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is obvious that Zhou Wei Zhuo had also been shocked by his previous \u2018beyond the ordinary\u2019 aesthetic.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo spoke a few words about future styling, then Ming Yu and Zhao Rui left the dressing room. Zhou Wei Zhuo and couldn\u2019t help asking as they reached the door. \u201cMing Yu, today\u2026 you seem quite different from before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu paused for a moment, before asking with a laugh. \u201cSister Zhou, the last time we met seemed to be around six months ago right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo nodded. \u201cIt should be more than six months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s smile became more brilliant at these words. \u201cSo\u2026 Sister Zhou, it has been so long that I have grown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>He giggled lightly and left Zhou Wei Zhuo standing stupidly for a long time. It was only after a while that she discovered that she was alone in the quiet dressing room. Zhou Wei Zhuo opened her mouth. \u201cOnly 17 years old, what growing up? That kid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she spoke like this, Zhou Wei Zhuo couldn\u2019t help blushing and awkwardly coughed twice. Zhou Wei Zhuo was already in her late 30s and had seen countless beauties, but she admitted that she was captivated by that kid\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just a matter of appearance. It was due to the temperament that Ming Yu showed just now, as if he had undergone countless ups and downs. The infinite beauty that made a person gaze into the past.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo let her assistant pack up the things and recalled a very different Ming Yu. She nodded and sighed, \u201cIt looks like Zhao Rui will be very busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>If Zhou Wei Zhuo was amazed, what about the other Muse employees? As Zhao Rui and Ming Yu moved from the dressing room to the elevator, the many make-up artists, assistants and models they encountered along the way were surprised to see such a handsome young man. Some even turned back to look at him.</p><br/><p>The jade skin was without any blemishes, as if a skilled hand had covered up all the flaws of the past. This fine jade thoroughly showed off his elegant manner.</p><br/><p>Of course, Muse wasn\u2019t lacking in beauty. However, the most beautiful people were always busy around the world, so they rarely appeared in the company. Now that they could see a beauty, who wouldn\u2019t appreciate it?</p><br/><p>People were visual animals, so there was no mistake involved in them enjoying beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle\u2026Little Chen, who was that person just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey? You don\u2019t know? That is Ming Yu, a model of our company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? He is also a model? He must be newly signed, otherwise how have I never seen him before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ming Yu was signed a long time ago. You actually don\u2019t know this. I will slowly tell you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the car, Ming Yu put on his seat belt as Zhao Rui harshly asked him. \u201cThis\u2026 Ming Yu, what really stimulated you today? The air around the current you and the you in the past\u2026 it is really different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui couldn\u2019t describe what if felt like. He could only see that when he first saw Ming Yu today, he felt like the young man had really changed. Then after Zhou Wei Zhuo cut off the long hair, he felt like the youth had become even more outstanding.</p><br/><p>After picking up Ming Yu in the hospital and learning that he wanted to change his style, how happy was Zhao Rui? But how many people would change like this unless something drastic happened?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had only shown a little bit of his aura when he first saw Zhao Rui. After his image change, he let go without any reservations.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought of this and careless put the blame on Zhou Wei Zhuo. \u201cI\u2019m not affected by any stimulus. I just wanted to accept the situation and move on. As for why I\u2019m different from the past\u2026 Sister Zhou helped me change my image, so of course I\u2019m not the same as before. Brother Zhao, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui smiled and nodded. \u201cYes, it makes sense. Her hands are very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Wei Zhuo who wasn\u2019t present: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She just changed the image, not a face-lift! How could she do something so miraculous?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the original owner was only very close to Cheng Su and didn\u2019t care about Zhao Rui. Therefore, Zhao didn\u2019t find any anomalies. He only thought that \u2018Cheng Su\u2019s magazine interview\u2019 and the \u2018change in appearance\u2019 made him look more mature.</p><br/><p>This was really good. Ming Yu would get good jobs, become popular and they would drink later!</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui accompanied Ming Yu to his apartment and reminded him. \u201cMing Yu, don\u2019t forget there is a photoshoot for a magazine tomorrow. Wake up early to prepare, understand? You might just be a clothing model, but it is a second-tier magazine. You should wear today\u2019s clothes. Rest well tonight and I\u2019ll pick you tomorrow morning.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s mood became even better after receiving a position reply from the youth. Zhao Rui said goodbye to Ming Yu and the care drove off. He didn\u2019t know that despite telling Ming Yu to get a good rest, the youth didn\u2019t fall asleep right away. Instead, he found a thick magazine.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2026 the photoshoot is for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu flipped through the magazine, briefly analyzing the style and content of the magazine. Then he turned off the lights and fell asleep. The next day, he arrived at \u2018Fashion Entertainment\u2019 Headquarters and stopped in surprise.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

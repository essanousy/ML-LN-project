Tan Jingming bowed his head and thought about it. At last, he seemed to muster up the courage. He glanced at Ming Yu before taking the glass of wine and walking to Director Xu\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>The next scene happened as Ming Yu guessed.</p><br/><p>In the face of a junior making amends, Director Xu showed disdain at the beginning before gradually becoming more serious.</p><br/><p>Once Tan Jingming finished the fourth glass, Director Xu grabbed the glass and said, \u201cIs it okay to drink so much? Do you want to go to the hospital? Go back to your seat and have a good meal. Be smart you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Jingming stayed still for a moment. Then he understood Director Xu\u2019s meaning and nodded happily. He returned to his seat and thanked Ming Xiaoyu for a long time.</p><br/><p>However, it was just verbal thanks. Ming Xiaoyu received no benefits from it. Yet by the time the dinner was over, Director Xu\u2019s eyes had glanced over him several times. Director Xu smiled at Ming Yu and said straightforwardly, \u201cDid you help Tan Xiaozi deal with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu spread open his hands helplessly. \u201cDirector Xu, how could you say that? Didn\u2019t you want Brother Tan to do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Tan completely ignored his words. He just scoffed. \u201cHe looks like his mother. If he didn\u2019t have Tan Yunqing\u2019s face, I would\u2019ve directly driven that kid out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Xu\u2019s tone changed slightly when he spoke the name \u2018Tan Yunqing.\u2019 Ming Yu was keenly aware of it and read the reason with surprise. He laughed and said, \u201cDirector Xu, you originally worship Tan Yunqing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Xu\u2019s body stiffened and he immediately glared at Ming Xiaoyu. \u201cWhat are you saying? Young man, it doesn\u2019t have a profound meaning and isn\u2019t anything bad. This is pure reverence and respect, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>In this respect, Ming Yu couldn\u2019t laugh.</p><br/><p>He guessed that in Director Xu\u2019s era, there were few talented women like Tan Yunqing. There was probably less than 100, around 50 women. Maybe it was different in France, but in the capital of Huaxia\u2026 well, it was possible.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had never experienced this \u2018goddess worship\u2019, but he could imagine it.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t feel much worship towards God Xi, so how could he worship Tan Yunqing? It was hard!</p><br/><p>Anyway, all of the advertisements for Nidelan were filmed. A few days later, the \u2018New Life\u2019 album was released nationwide.</p><br/><p>As one of the protagonists of the MV, Ming Xiaoyu directly asked Luo Ru to buy 30 albums. His contract didn\u2019t have any obligation for him to promote the MV later on. However, Ming Yu still posted an image of himself with the MV to his Weibo and official website, as well as a message:</p><br/><p>\u3010 It is the first time that I am challenging this type of role! The song is very beautiful! PS: I am also very handsome ~[/smiling face] \u3011</p><br/><p>The MV was just released today and Ming Yu bought it early. Most people didn\u2019t know about the contents of the MV. Ming Yu quickly signed his 10 posters and asked Luo Ru to send them along with the MV to 10 fans.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was surprised to see that Ming Yu had bought so many albums. He asked, \u201cXiaoyu, you only need to buy 10 copies if you want to send albums to the fans. Plus, you only need to buy 5 more if you want to support New Life. Why did you buy so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was looking down at another 20 albums at the time of Xhao Rui\u2019s words. The young man carefully took 15 albums and placed them in the gift bags Luo Ru brought. Then he said with a laugh, \u201cBrother Zhao, you really don\u2019t understand. Most of the albums I bought are gifts to other people. This isn\u2019t my song but I am starring in it. Giving it to other people isn\u2019t a problem. If it is possible to connect with their emotions, maybe\u2026 it might play an unexpected role and even make CX Entertainment thank me.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the time, Zhao Rui didn\u2019t understand Ming Yu\u2019s meaning. But that evening, after a Weibo message was released, Zhao Rui looked at him with a \u2018Xiaoyu, you aren\u2019t a person\u2019 type expression.</p><br/><p>Yes, Ming Yu bought so many albums to give away. Who was he giving them to?</p><br/><p>Smaller people such as Liu Qian and Wu Yuzheng, as well as slightly larger people like Zhu Kejia and Fei Sixin. Ming Xiaoyu even gave them to Du Ruo, Old Fei and Xi Ze!</p><br/><p>The people who received the album were quite surprised at first. But as long as they took the time to look at the MV, they couldn\u2019t help being attracted to the sophistication of the special effects and the beautiful scenes.</p><br/><p>First-tier models like Liu Qian and Wu Yuzhen helping to promote \u2018New Life\u2019 was already a huge income. Zhu Kejia and Fei Sixin advertised it again, attracting people in the fashion industry and entertainment industry. The most successful means of propaganda came from Du Ruo.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo was one of Huaxia\u2019s top female supermodels and ranked second only to Cecilia and He Chaoman in the world.</p><br/><p>Once she opened her mouth, a huge number of fans flocked to her words. They didn\u2019t buy the album immediately, but they did go online to watch the MV.</p><br/><p>Then they saw that this was incredible! Buy it quickly!!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu hadn\u2019t expected that everyone he sent the album to would promote New Life. He did estimate that this behaviour would have a lot of repercussions. Everyone was doing free advertisement for Ming Xiaoyu. What did this mean?</p><br/><p>It showed that in these people\u2019s hearts, they were very fond of Ming Xiaoyu and also trusted him.</p><br/><p>But if you thought that Du Ruo was the biggest bomb, you would be wrong!</p><br/><p>If Du Ruo\u2019s influence was a bomb, Xi Ze\u2019s was undoubtedly a deep-sea torpedo! As long as it was fired, it would be broadcasted everywhere (?).</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s new home had finished its renovations. After more than a month, the house was completely renovated and Ming Xiaoyu was ready to move in the next day. Thus, the day before he moved in, Ming Xiaoyu invited the upstairs neighbour to come down for a meal. It was a moving meal.</p><br/><p>This moving dinner needed to be done seriously! It might just be two people, but at least five dishes of different textures and a soup was required.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze had just entered the door and hadn\u2019t got his bearings when Ming Xiaoyu smiled and held up an apron.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu said, \u201cCome on my dear, go and cook ^\uff3f^\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze changed his shoes and looked at the youth in front of him with a raised eyebrow. \u201cDear? Are you submitting to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu made an expression of astonishment. \u201cPeople think of food as their god! People are iron, rice is steel, not eating a meal will make you hungry! Mr. Xi, don\u2019t you know this? What is the old saying? A catty of ginseng is no match for a liter of brown rice. It is natural to submit before rice.\u201d</p><br/><p>The helpless Mr. Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu had planned this in advance and bought all the ingredients in the morning, waiting for a certain man to cook them. Ming Xiaoyu naturally didn\u2019t do nothing. Firstly, he contributed the food money and the kitchen. Secondly, he helped on the side\u2014 although Xi Ze only allowed him to do some movements with the chopsticks and hand over the dishes.</p><br/><p>Once the five dishes and one soup were finished, Xi Ze slowly washed his hands while Ming Xiaou served the dishes on the table. After Ming Yu was finished, XI Ze also carefully cleaned all his fingers and wiped it with a paper towel.</p><br/><p>The two men faced each other and started eating.</p><br/><p>This meal\u2026 well, Ming Xiaoyu invited the guest but Xi Ze personally cooked it.</p><br/><p>It was just like Ming Xiaoyu remembered. The flavours were amazing and the sense of aesthetics was extremely high. No one would doubt it if these dishes were served in a five-star hotel. They looked even more gorgeous than five-star hotel dishes!</p><br/><p>From a certain point of view, it also reflected the man\u2019s picky nature.</p><br/><p>After eating, Ming Xiaoyu directly handed the \u2018New Life\u2019 album to Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze glanced at it and asked, \u201cIs it a gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu smiled and agreed. \u201cYes, it is a gift for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was obviously very concerned about the daily life of his small mushroom. He raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cWhy are your gifts to Du Ruo and the others all wrapped up in paper and placed in a nice gift bag?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wasn\u2019t surprised that this man unexpectedly knew so much. He calmly spread his hands and said honestly, \u201cYou are different from them. I don\u2019t need to wrap it is so many good things.\u201d</p><br/><p>These simple and flattering words unexpectedly made Xi Ze very happy. He hummed lightly and opened the MV. The two people watched it together before Xi Ze took a picture of the MV and directly uploaded it to his Weibo and Muse website.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xi Ze: A good song and MV. It is worth listening and watching. [/Image] \u3011</p><br/><p>Once this was done, Xi Ze didn\u2019t care about the fans\u2019 reactions. He immediately pulled the youth into his arms and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat is my reward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu smiled. \u201cI let you eat so many dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t I cook them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu replied in a surprised manner. \u201cI bought the ingredients and the kitchen is mine. Well, since you cooked, I won\u2019t let you wash the dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them watched TV for a while. Then they happened to see an idol drama, where the male protagonist was confessing to the heroine. The confession was being carried out in man-made heavy rain. The actor was crying while the heroine was also crying without it being shown.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu watched it and wondered, \u201cHave you ever confessed to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze turned to look at the youth in his arms and asked, \u201cHave you ever confessed to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them froze in silence for a moment. Then they finally turned their heads and said in unison, \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they spoke, the two men turned to look at each other with surprise and then laughed.</p><br/><p>Well, a confession didn\u2019t matter. Looking at this male and female protagonist\u2019s grieving appearance, Ming Yu/Xi Ze couldn\u2019t imagine themselves in this terrible situation.</p><br/><p>Both of them had known each other\u2019s hearts. They just kept it in an ambiguous state without pointing out the other person\u2019s feelings. This type of feeling was wonderful, peculiar and dreamlike. If it was poked, it might burst. It was better to maintain this status quo and not give up such a beautiful thing.</p><br/><p>Then that first kiss poked it.</p><br/><p>Since both of them felt that it was time, they would directly be together. Who cared about twists and turns?</p><br/><p>They watched the actor confess, the heroine accept and then the two people kissed in the heavy rain.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s first reaction was, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they catch a cold, have a cough or a runny nose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s first reaction was, \u201cThat actor is a bad kisser.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu turned his head and narrowed his eyes. \u201cIt seems like you are very experienced?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze innocently spread his hands. \u201cIt is all imagination and self-teaching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Xi Ze held his man and let Ming Xiaoyu realize the strength of this \u2018self-teaching.\u2019 The two people were very happy, while on the other side, the male and female protagonists held each other and started to make sighing sounds. Hearing this, Ming Xiaoyu laughed and pushed Xi Ze away, quickly turning off the TV.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu saw Xi Ze\u2019s \u2018This film broke the atmosphere\u2019 expression and smiled. Then he directly pressed against the man\u2019s body and started a lingering kiss.</p><br/><p>The man very much enjoyed the feeling of the young man pressing against him and kissed him seriously. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s self-taught technique was clearly inferior but Xi Ze didn\u2019t care. He just let the other person lick his lips.</p><br/><p>The two people kissed each other until it was 11 o\u2019clock. Xi Ze put on his jacket to go upstairs while MIng Yu handed him the album.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to Europe in two days and probably won\u2019t be back for some time.\u201d Xi Ze said as he took the album and stood at the entrance. \u201cYou can always call me. If you can\u2019t get through, call Ding Bo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu nodded lightly before suddenly having a thought. \u201cAh right, how far is your nearest house from my new home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze coughed with a strange expression and whispered, \u201cUpstairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze added, \u201cThe whole top floor is mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, he wasn\u2019t very angry. He took advantage of standing on stairs to obtain a height difference and kissed Xi Ze. The latter clearly didn\u2019t expect for Ming Yu to unexpectedly give him a kiss. However, adjusting to the height wasn\u2019t difficult for Xi Ze. He maintained the shorter position and grabbed the youth\u2019s waist, suddenly deepening the kiss.</p><br/><p>Poor Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s \u2018self-taught\u2019 abilities weren\u2019t very good. He was left dizzy from Xi Ze\u2019s kiss as the other person aggressively sucked on his tongue. After the kiss finished, Ming Yu\u2019s lips were red and swollen.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled calmly. \u201cA good night kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu coughed twice and covered his flushed face. \u201cIt is a good night kiss. After all, you will be gone for a period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Ming Xiaoyu still didn\u2019t know. The very next day, he had just arrived at the company when Zhao Rui entered the lounge and excitedly exclaimed, \u201cXiaoyu! Do you know what happened? You absolutely won\u2019t expect it! We are going to Europe!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

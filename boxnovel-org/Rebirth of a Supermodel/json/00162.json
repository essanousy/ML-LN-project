She thought that this was a fan who wanted to challenge her position as \u2018first mushroom fan,\u2019 They really weren\u2019t a match! Look at this page. The Weibo was only created today.</p><br/><p>Hey, what was the photo? What type of photo could it be? Did they buy 1,000 magazines?</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing casually opened this image. She intended to just take a look before ignoring it. After all, who cares if the fan bought 1,000? Xiao Biqing only bought 1,000 becase she was worried she would have no place to put the magazines. With Xiao Biqing\u2019s status and net worth in the industry, she could buy 10,000\u2026 well, this amount was a bit much. Buying 5,000 was no problem!</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing casually glanced at it, planning to close the page and do her own thing. However! Once she saw the photo, Xiao Biqing squinted and stared with aghast eyes for a long time!</p><br/><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing stared for a long time, refreshing the page because she couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>But as soon as it was refreshed, she was horrified! This Weibo, which had just one comment, now had more than 200 comments in just one minute! By the way, the original single digit followers increased to more than 500!</p><br/><p>\u2026What was going on?</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing took a closer look at the photo and saw that her eyes weren\u2019t wrong. Her expression changed from \u201c\u256e\uff08\u256f\u25bd\u2570\uff09\u256d\u201d to \u201c\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>\u3010 I counted it. There are around 20 books in each pile, for a total of 10,000 books! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Isn\u2019t this too exaggerated? This is simply a defeat! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I finally understand why the Suyi sales on the second day in Huaxia was actually 18W. This Zyu bought 1W\u2026 crazy! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 QAQ If i have money then I will buy! I also want to buy a Mushroom life-sized pillow. I will hold it every hold, hold Mushroom every day!!! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This was basically amazing.</p><br/><p>Some people this was a way to show off wealth. But Xiao Biqing never showed off her other things. She only showed the Ming Xiaoyu goods that she bought. From magazines to posters, from Nidelan perfumes to Feilu watches, as long as it was something related to Ming Xiaoyu, Xiao Biqing would buy them.</p><br/><p>She was capable so she would support the model she liked.</p><br/><p>As you know, with any model or celebrities\u2019 fans, there had to be one or two leaders.</p><br/><p>When a model or celebrity endorsed something, the leader\u2019s job was to appeal as the spokesperson. If the fans didn\u2019t make contributions to the people they liked, it would only make the public think that the appeal of this model was too weak. From then on, there would be fewer and fewer endorsers willing to cooperate with this model.</p><br/><p>A few years ago, there was a very popular and fresh meat in the entertainment industry. This person was very handsome and his acting skills were okay. Thus, after he became popular with an idol drama, many brands came to him for his endorsements. However, most of the fans attracted by this fresh actor were young fans. These fans supported him online, saying he was very handsome, but they never took action. They didn\u2019t even buy a bottle of water worth a few dollars.</p><br/><p>Since then, there were fewer and fewer endorsers looking to cooperate with this fresh actor. The status of this actor in the industry gradually decreased.</p><br/><p>In this world, one couldn\u2019t survive on only love.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Xiao Biqing\u2019s act wasn\u2019t just dazzling the fans and expressing her love for Ming Xiaoyu. It was also calling on the fans. She couldn\u2019t be a young fan. She must support her favourite person within the limits of her ability and give him motivation.</p><br/><p>Fans outside the industry might not know this but Xiao Biqing knew one thing. Suyi rarely invited male models to be their cover person. This time, they invited the male model Ming Xiaoyu who hadn\u2019t yet reached the world\u2019s supermodel rankings. It really overturned many people\u2019s glasses.</p><br/><p>Suyi showed off Ming Yu\u2019s appeal.</p><br/><p>His fans were very united and supportive of the people they liked.</p><br/><p>This time, Suyi\u2019s gamble was right. In the past, Suyi had sold less than Muse. But in terms of just this September issue, Suyi surpassed Muse!</p><br/><p>Of course, Ming Xiaoyu repeatedly emphasized this fact on his fan forum and Weibo: I hope that fans won\u2019t save money and hurt themselves in order to buy my various merchandise. For example, going hungry and only eating instant noodles for a month in order to buy a Feilu watch. This type of behaviour wasn\u2019t acceptable!</p><br/><p>And now there was someone\u2026 He bought 10,000 copies of Suyi!!</p><br/><p>10,000 magazines.</p><br/><p>What concept was this?</p><br/><p>For many second-tier magazines with poor sales, 10,000 copies was their first day sales!</p><br/><p>This was the first day sales!!</p><br/><p>One person buying 10,000 copies, wasn\u2019t this too much of a tyrant?</p><br/><p>\u3010Z Great God Z is more terrible than Goddess Xiao Xiao! I don\u2019t understand this world of local tyrants! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I am also very embarrassed. I want to be like Goddess Xiao Xiao and God Z QAQ. Last month, I originally wanted to eat a month of cabbage porridge in order to buy a few bottles of Nidelan perfumes. But Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t want us to be hungry so I only bought five issues of Suyi\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu is fantastic! Everyone is good at supporting Mushroom. I have to support Mushroom as well! Don\u2019t eat KFC today. Go buy a few issues of Suyi! \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing also felt a lot of emotions when she saw that this Zyu person was so supportive of Ming Xiaoyu. But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I can\u2019t afford 10,000! I will be the lead mushroom fan!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Five minutes later, many fans of Ming Xiaoyu were surprised to find that Goddess Xiao Xiao Yu Yu actually sent another Weibo message!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xiao Xiao Yu Yu: The leader mushroom is me! Don\u2019t think of taking the position of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s first leader mushroom [email\u00a0protected] [/Image] \u3011</p><br/><p>It was the first time that \u2018leader mushroom\u2019 was seen by Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans. But they understood it after thinking a bit. Goddess Xiao Xiao wanted to be the first fan to lead the other fans to support Ming Xiaoyu. The lead mushroom was actually the leader.</p><br/><p>Sometimes a leader fan had a really big effect.</p><br/><p>If a fan circle didn\u2019t buy genuine merchandise, other fans would think this way: Why should I buy it? Everyone else didn\u2019t buy it. I just need to take photos and videos.</p><br/><p>But suppose there was a leader who lead everyone to support the person they liked. Then the effect would become stronger and stronger. In the end, the entire fan circle would work hard to contribute, whether big or small. The fans supported their own idol to go further and further.</p><br/><p>Now Xiao Xiao Yu Yu made a declaration to Zyu: I am the leader!</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing had only distributed a photo on her Weibo but this photo made all of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans stunned. They stared at the photo with eyes wide from disbelief.</p><br/><p>In this photo, countless Nidelan perfumes were arranged in a corner of the room! There were four types, each type had at least a few hundred bottles! They were arranged neatly and really seemed to give off a fragrant scent!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xiao Xiao Yu Yu: Oh yes, I basically bought these perfumes for my own use. Sometimes I will give them to my friends. Right now, I have sent a few hundred bottles. Everyone says that it is very good to use\uff5e [/Laugh] \u3011 Oh my god! She gave away hundreds of bottles and there were still so many left?</p><br/><p>Was there a mistake?!!</p><br/><p>They could take a bath with these perfumes, wash back and forth!!</p><br/><p>They all bowed before the domineering \u2018Xiao Xiao Yu Yu.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u3010 Goddess Xiao Xiao is absolute true love! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Looking at so many perfumes, I also want to buy a bottle. Before the bottle is used up, buy it! \u3011 \u3010 It is really great. No wonder why Nidelan has been interacting with Ming Xiaoyu on the official website. It is definitely because Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s appeal is particularly strong! No, I have to buy another bottle! Let\u2019s make Ming Xiaoyu stand taller! \u3011 After seeing so many supportive fans, Ming Xiaoyu laughed.</p><br/><p>Who cared about 1W Suyi copies? She completely defeated Zyu with her perfumes!</p><br/><p>However, five minutes later, a fan responded under Xiao Biqing\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u3010 My god! I just saw that Great God Z has sent another photo! It is terrible! \u3011</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u256c\uffe3\uffe3\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>What had this Z done again?!!</p><br/><p>There was one new photo on Zyu\u2019s Weibo and everyone opened it.</p><br/><p>Their expressions suddenly became \u201c\u2211\uff08\u3063 \u00b0\u0414 \u00b0\uff1b\uff09\u3063\u201d!!!</p><br/><p>What was surprising? Wasn\u2019t this too scary?</p><br/><p>How many watches were there? 100? 20? They had to at least be in the three digits!!</p><br/><p>They were the Feilu series of watches, the cheapest one about 5K. The most expensive one reached a price of nearly 10W!</p><br/><p>The hundreds of watches from God Z were far less than Xiao Biqing\u2019s thousands of bottles, but how expensive were Nidelan perfumes? One bottle cost several hundred. Then what about these watches?</p><br/><p>It was a big difference!</p><br/><p>As everyone was feeling shocked, the gold king Z finally opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu\uff1aAs the leader of Ming Yu\u2019s mushroom fans, I gave away dozens of watches. My friends said they like it very much. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026My god!! A complete defeat! Your wife knows!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \uff08/= \uff3f =\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534 I don\u2019t know!!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

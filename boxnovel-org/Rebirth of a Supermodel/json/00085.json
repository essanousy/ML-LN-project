The first one was a comprehensive movie and television studio set. For example, the Hengdian film and television studio had relatively complete equipment, including separate zones for ancient styles, modern styles, European styles, etc.</p><br/><p>The other was the small studio that Ming Yu came to in the capital.</p><br/><p>It was a movie and television studio, but it was also a large commercial area. There were several skyscrapers where the top floor showed the scenery of the capital. It was a very modern atmosphere. Many modern movies liked to be shot here, as well as store wars and special occasions.</p><br/><p>The main reason Ming Yu was here was to shoot the bustling city night scene.</p><br/><p>They came early today and had to wait for it to be dark, but indoor shots could be filmed.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu followed behind the deputy director. From afar, he could see the director Xu Yizong. He was standing next to the camera team and seemed to be saying something.</p><br/><p>After Ming Yu arrived, he didn\u2019t hurry into makeup. Instead, he went and greeted Director Xu.</p><br/><p>A handsome and beautiful young man was politely greeting him. No matter how angry Director Xu still was, he temporarily suppressed it and nodded to Ming Yu. Then he asked, \u201cHave you seen the issued script?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled with certainty. \u201cI have read it, Director Xu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Xu didn\u2019t care much and just nodded. Then he suddenly had a thought. \u201cThis is the first time I am meeting you, but I have seen the lemonade ads you shot last time. That state might be able to fool the audience, but not me. I hope you will not act like you did in the lemonade advertisements. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be polite to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was somewhat surprised by these words. However, he still laughed and promised.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru waited until they were walking to the dressing room before speaking anxiously, \u201cI heard that Director Xu Yizong was a very serious person. But I didn\u2019t expect him to be this serious. Xiaoyu, you only have the Shuyue Lemonade advertisements publicly available. Director Xu must\u2019ve seen it and studied it. It seems like you should be careful today.\u201d Then the worried Luo Ru asked, \u201cXiaoyu, have you really read the script?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled at Luo Ru\u2019s words and asked, \u201cSister Luo, are you really asking me this question?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru responded in a confused manner. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sighed heavily and opened his mouth to recite the script. \u201cThe character walks into the noisy room. He encounters a blonde woman. The character runs a hand through the blonde hair. Then he passes through and leaves the room. The scene changes to floor-to-ceiling windows. A figure is looking at the night view of the city while holding a bottle of perfume in his hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu paused and took a breath at the end. Then he asked helplessly, \u201cThere are only these words in the script. Sister Luo, are you really asking me if I have read the script carefully?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Luo, \u201c\u2026\uff3f\uff08\uff1a3\u2220\uff09\uff3f\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike the Shuyue Lemonades, the Nidelan advertisements didn\u2019t have a story. A good advertisement could succeed if it expressed the basic demands of the produce.</p><br/><p>A male model was used to endorse the Nidelan \u2018Smoke\u2019 fragrances. It wasn\u2019t possible to use the model itself to describe the perfume. Therefore, Ming Yu\u2019s role in this advertisement was to show the mood and style of the Smoke fragrances.</p><br/><p>He wanted to steal incense from the blonde hair and this stolen incense eventually became the Smoke perfume.</p><br/><p>This was the purpose of the Nidelan advertisement.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu and Luo Ru entered the dressing room, where Zhao Rui and Sister Zheng were already waiting. Ming Yu and Luo Ru\u2019s homes were close to each other, so Luo Ru picked him up most of the time. Meanwhile, Zhao Rui picked up Sister Zheng or sometimes Sister Zheng would drive herself.</p><br/><p>The makeup style had already been established at the last shot. At this moment, Ming Yu changed clothers and sat in front of the makeup mirror, quietly allowing Sister Zheng to apply makeup on him.</p><br/><p>Sister Zheng\u2019s movements were swift and smart. It took her only 10 minutes to finish it.</p><br/><p>At this time, Sister Zheng took out an eyeliner and gently applied a mole under Ming Yu\u2019s right eye. Then she laughed and said, \u201cI have discussed it with Zhao Rui. We feel that it is better for Xiaoyu to have your own characteristic, allowing your future impression to be better. Since I have given you a mole for some jobs in the past, I will try to do it whenever it doesn\u2019t conflict with the job. Once fans think of you, they will think of this feature and your impression will be more profound.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui added, \u201cYes Xiaoyu. Whether it is a model or an actor, it is better to have an ugly characteristic than no characteristics. Sister Zheng\u2019s mole is really suitable for you. It is very nice. It would be better if it becomes your special feature.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this respect, Ming Yu didn\u2019t object.</p><br/><p>While Sister Zheng stayed in the dressing room to clean up, Ming Yu and the others walked into the studio. Luo Ru first went to familiarize herself with the people around them, while Ming Yu raised his hand to the position of the mole and pondered on it.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help looking at his appearance in the mirror. It indeed looked good.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s words were right. Whether it was the fashion industry or entertainment industry, he would just be like everyone else if he didn\u2019t have a special characteristic. Therefore, plastic surgery became popular in both industries in the past few years. However, the plastic surgery artists found that this only gave them a face similar to others and they suffered a loss.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought this and smiled at Zhao Rui. \u201cBrother Zhao, I feel that you have become very powerful recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui heard his words and couldn\u2019t respond at first. \u201cPowerful? What is so powerful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu explained, \u201cThe proposal you put forward this time is really great. You and Sister Zheng really surprised me. In addition, last time you found a house very quickly. The house is in a good location and the traffic is convenient. The owner just went abroad so it is cheap and affordable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui shook his head shyly and refuted humbly. \u201cIn fact, this can\u2019t be credited to me. I talked to Sister Zheng for a while before thinking about this. As for the house, it can\u2019t be completely credited to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and joked, \u201cIf it can\u2019t be credited to you, do you want to give me the credit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui shook his head quickly and explain, \u201cHow can it be because of you, Xiaoyu? This is Shen Xiang\u2019s contribution!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming XIaoyu\u2019s smile stiffened at the words. After a long moment, he tentatively asked, \u201cThis matter\u2026is related with Director Shen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui didn\u2019t notice Ming Yu\u2019s strange expression. He nodded and said, \u201cYes, I didn\u2019t expect Shen Xiang to be so enthusiastic. I just mentioend it and he put it in his heart. Hey Xiaoyu, didn\u2019t I tell you about this? It happened when I drank tea with Shen Xiang. At that time, I was looking for a house for you and mentioned it quietly. As a result, he gave me some good real estate information the next day. I looked at them and chose the one you bought now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui spoke emotionally, \u201cShen Xiang is so good! He is loyal! I have to later invite him to a meal to thank him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, thank him for helping Ming Yu buy the house\u2026</p><br/><p>In the time before filming, Ming Yu took out his phone and sent a message to a certain man. \u3010 Do you know where my new house is? \u3011</p><br/><p>This sentence out of nowhere would cause normal people to feel confusion. But after a few minutes, Xi Ze sent the following message back: \u3010 I know. \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu who saw the message, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Ming Xiaoyu replied. \u3010 Is that house yours? \u3011 After a long time, Xi Ze calmly replied: \u3010 No. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Whose is it? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 The person you bought it from. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 \u2026\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>Believe it or not, I will kill you!</p><br/><p>This guy was really too much. Ming Xiaoyu decided to wait for his return and torment this shameless man. Then he sent a text message again. \u3010 Do you really not know the Mr. Li who sold me the house? \u3011</p><br/><p>This time, Xi Ze took a little longer to reply. Ming Yu had waited a while when he suddenly received a long paragraph. \u3010 Mr. Li? Is the gentleman who sold you the house surnamed Li? I seem to remember that I have an old classmate called Li who lives in that area. Is it him? This is really perfect timing. What a curious coincidence. \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>What coincidence?</p><br/><p>The youth no longer replied to the text message. In the studio of Ji and Ya, an elegant man stared at the phone for a long time, his lips slightly curved and the colour in his eyes deepened.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was secretly sending text messages while working. In the eyes of the assistant designers and senior tailors of Ji and Ya, this was no less than the probability of a comet hitting the earth!</p><br/><p>Once the meeting was over, Ding Bo curiously asked, \u201cXi Ze, who sent you a text message today? It isn\u2019t like you to text back when you are in a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xi Ze was sitting in the main seat of the meeting room, smiling while playing with the phone. His slender fingers were skillfully turning the phone around and around. He heard Ding Bo\u2019s words and stopped his actions, looking up at his agent. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Ding Bo nodded earnestly. \u201cYes, it isn\u2019t like you at all. What stimulated this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze thought for a moment before finally asking back, \u201cThe stimulation of love?\u201d Xi Ze didn\u2019t wait for Ding Bo to respond. He said with a sigh. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in a relationship, so you probably won\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo cried out indignantly, \u201c== Why should I be in relationship? I a noble single man, a noble single man you understand! I\u2019m free to do whatever I want\u2026 wait a minute! Xi Ze, what did you just say? I think I heard you wrong. Can you repeat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The handsome man swept his deep eyes over Ding Bo and said calmly. \u201cA person not in a relationship really can\u2019t understand the feeling of love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo made an aggressive expression. \u201cHow surprising!!! You have a target? You are in a relationship? You are in a relationship? What person would actually tolerate your character enough to like you? If you are in a relationship then God is really blind!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly turned over his phone. Ding Bo was venting when he remembered something. \u201cDamn, you bastard. You should\u2019ve told me sooner if you are in a relationship. Who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre they my partner or yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo replied, \u201cOf course they are yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why should I tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You, don\u2019t leave work! You can\u2019t go!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the movie and TV studio that was halfway across the capital, Xi Ze\u2019s partner found an abnormality between the director and camera team. His walk stopped as he became surprised.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s skit:</p><br/><p>Big Xi: You don\u2019t understand the feeling of love.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu: Ah, come over here first. I\u2019ll kill you.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He quickly negotiated with the other magazine and agreed to cooperate three days after this conversation.</p><br/><p>This meant that after Ming Yu returned from Fashion Entertainment, he had three days of freedom. In the past, the first reaction of Ming Yu whenever he had a break was to ask about what Cheng Su was doing. Therefore, Zhao Rui was surprised when Ming Yu now asked him seriously. \u201cBrother Zhao, do you have copies of the world\u2019s major magazines over the past 10 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to Zhao Rui\u2019s repeated requests, Ming Yu no longer used honorifics with Zhao Rui.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui thought he didn\u2019t hear properly until Ming Yu repeated it. Then he replied, \u201cThe magazines over the past 10 years for the world\u2019s major magazines? Isn\u2019t this too much? I don\u2019t think there is a spacious collection room large enough to contain all of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought for a moment before adding, \u201cIt is fine as long as it the top magazines, first-tier and second-tier magazines.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui thought carefully before he suddenly recalled something. \u201cYes! I\u2019m not certain, but I think the company definitely has this! I remember that the company\u2019s basement was designed to collect the major magazines for each year. There might not be second-tier magazines, but the first-tier magazines would certainly be there.\u201d Having said that, Zhao Rui stopped before asking with confusion. \u201cMing Yu, what are you doing to do with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The delicate and handsome youth smiled lightly. \u201cI want to start reading magazines.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was naturally thinking something completely different from Ming Yu. From Zhao Rui\u2019s perspective, most models in fashion shows or photo shoots would read the magazine a few hours before it took place. They got in the right mood before starting the shoot or catwalk. What was there to specifically study?</p><br/><p>However, Ming Yu thought differently.</p><br/><p>What was a fashion magazine?</p><br/><p>Fashion magazines were the most obvious signs of the current fashion style.</p><br/><p>Apart from the gossip that didn\u2019t require much attention, the top magazines contained seasonal fashion trends, recent fashion shows and some of the basic information about the fashion world.</p><br/><p>Yes, fashion magazines would help Ming Yu understand this world better.</p><br/><p>At present, Ming Yu\u2019s understanding of the world was based on the memories of the original owner. However, some of his memories were vague. He also didn\u2019t care about some people in the fashion industry. For example, he didn\u2019t remember Zhu Wei. In this case, reading the fashion magazines was the best way to completely integrate into this world.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui got Ming Yu a borrowing card and for three days, Ming Yu completely immersed himself in the tens of thousands of fashion magazines.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu read very quickly, but he memorized all the useful contents. On the second day, he finished reading all the paper based fashion magazines. Then on the third day, he finished the electronic magazines that appeared in recent years.</p><br/><p>This type of reading was really boring, even if they were colourful fashion magazines. Zhao Rui couldn\u2019t stand it. So, on the second day, he drove Ming Yu to the company then sneaked out of the collections room.</p><br/><p>The warm sunshine shone through the small window into the collections room, illuminating the handsome young man sitting alone in a corner chair, head bent over a magazine and flipping through it. The speed of his actions wasn\u2019t slow, but it felt like this scene was a freeze-frame, a quiet and beautiful picture.</p><br/><p>However, this picture was soon interrupted by a sudden ringing sound.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu unconsciously muted the phone first, then he looked down at the name on the screen and frowned. He put the magazine down and exited the collections room to speak on the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the simple \u2018hello\u2019, Ming Yu heard a sarcastic voice. \u201cIt has been a long time Ming Yu. I think I saw you in the company today? Since when have you started coming to the company?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice was fresh and clean, causing Ming Yu to involuntarily feel a sense of familiarity. But he didn\u2019t speak, he just listened to the other person\u2019s words. \u201cI told you clearly last time, don\u2019t bother me again. I don\u2019t feel anything towards you in that respect. Don\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s heart suddenly soured as he heard the intentionally aggravating words. Ming Yu clearly knew that this wasn\u2019t his emotions or memories, but he felt a heavy atmosphere and a slight bitter taste in his mouth.</p><br/><p>Was he still holding onto this man?</p><br/><p>As he thought, the person on the other end of the phone declared. \u201cMing Yu, don\u2019t come to bother me. I am very busy. I\u2019m not as free as you are everyday. This is the last call I will make to you, so don\u2019t call me later. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait a moment.\u201d Ming Yu smiled coldly at the other person\u2019s straightforward and hurtful words. \u201cMister, can you tell me before you continue talking\u2026 who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, there was the beeping sound of the phone being hung up. Ming Yu didn\u2019t call back since he knew that the other person must\u2019ve put him on the blacklist. It didn\u2019t matter if he was put on the blacklist. Even if he wasn\u2019t, he would take the initiative to put the other person on the blacklist first.</p><br/><p>Yes, Ming Yu knew that this person was Cheng Su since the second sentence.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t strange that he didn\u2019t recognize the other person\u2019s identity at first, since the original body had placed Cheng Su under a strange name.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u201cDarling\u201d</p><br/><p>In Ming Yu\u2019s past life, he had raised a husky that he called Darling. Now that he suddenly saw \u2018Darling\u2019 on the screen, an image of a panting tongue and foolish looking dog face subconsciously appeared in his mind. How could he think that Cheng Su was on the other end?</p><br/><p>Although this phone call was an accident, Ming Yu didn\u2019t intend to have much contact with Cheng Su. But at the same time, he understood that the obsession belonging to the original owner was still hidden deep in his heart and hadn\u2019t dissipated.</p><br/><p>What was the original obsession?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2019I want you to remember the name of Ming Yu for the rest of your life!\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled at the thought and whispered, \u201cRest assured. I will make sure he always remembers you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if in response to Ming Yu, the bitter feeling faded. Soon, Ming Yu put it behind him and started to carefully read the e-magazines. His break would end tomorrow, so he had to seize this time instead of thinking about Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>In a separate lounge on the 41st floor of Muse, a handsome man shook and threw his phone to the ground. Fortunately, the ground was covered with a soft rug so his phone survived without being smashed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho am I? Is this your new method? You better remember your words! Never think about who I am!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui couldn\u2019t believe that in three days, his model already read the last 10 years of the world\u2019s top magazines. The print and electronic versions of the first and second-tier magazines were all read! How could his small model remember anything, even if he read all of it? This was horrible!</p><br/><p>On the road to \u2018Character\u2019, Zhao Rui couldn\u2019t helpasking a few questions and he found that MIng Yu could answer all of them. He could express the trends of the fashion industry with a single word.</p><br/><p>The trends might not necessarily be popular now, but the fashion industry had a saying\u2014</p><br/><p>[10 years is a cycle.]</p><br/><p>The high-waisted pants and white shirt that were popular in the last century, couldn\u2019t they be seen on the streets now?</p><br/><p>The two people soon arrived at the headquarters of \u2018Character.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui stopped the car and Ming Yu got off first, looking up at the tall and towering building. It was smaller than Muse, but as a magazine\u2019s headquarters, Character was beyond many international first-tier magazines he saw in his previous life.</p><br/><p>In the past three days, Ming Yu had touched on the fashion industry of this world. The more he understood, the more excited and passionate he became about Huaxia in this world.</p><br/><p>Out of the top 10 magazines in the world, Huaxia accounted for four!</p><br/><p>Out of the world\u2019s 51 first-tier magazines, Huaxia accounted for eight!</p><br/><p>Out of the world\u2019s 200 second-tier magazines, Huaxia accounted for 16!</p><br/><p>Out of the world\u2019s four top fashion shows, Huaxia had one!!!</p><br/><p>Not to mention the variety of Huaxia top fashion brands and cutting-edge fashion brand.</p><br/><p>The Huaxia fashion circle truly had the ability to compete with Europe and the United States!</p><br/><p>In such an environment, Ming Yu had no worries despite all the large mountains in front of him.</p><br/><p>Character was one of the eight major fashion magazines in Huaxia.</p><br/><p>Last year, Character had barely squeezed into the ranks of Huaxia\u2019s first-tier magazines, so it was undoubtedly the youngest of the first-tier magazines. Character had only been founded for 20 years, so they often invited young and upcoming models to cooperate with them.</p><br/><p>So, among Huaxia\u2019s eight first-tier magazines, Character was the easiest stage for young models.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yu, you haven\u2019t entered yet? Let\u2019s go in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui pulled Ming Yu into Character\u2019s headquarters.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

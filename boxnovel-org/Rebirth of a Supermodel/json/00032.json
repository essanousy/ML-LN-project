However, around the large convention hall on the Third Ring Road, the low temperatures didn\u2019t freeze the enthusiasm of the reporters. Lights kept flashing on the red carpet and shutter sounds were heard.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t choose to be sneaky like last time, where he hid himself from the reporters. This time, he openly stepped onto the red carpet. After he entered the hall, he chatted with the swarming reporters for a few moments before leaving.</p><br/><p>He might be attending for Ming Yu, but he took the time to talk to Old Fei. Old Fei moved beside him. \u201cXi Ze, you really gave me a lot of face. You have been so busy recently, but you came to this show for my sake. Can you help me by going to a gathering later? I will owe you a favour!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled and gave a low laugh. \u201cGood, Old Fei.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026You see, a person took the initiative to offer this, so he shouldn\u2019t shun the personal favour.</p><br/><p>In the spacious and bright hall, most of the 500 seats were filled. They were surprised when they saw Xi Ze, before walking over to talk to him.</p><br/><p>After all, they had a relationship with Old Fei so most of the people here had some fame and weren\u2019t newcomers. Speaking a few words to Xi Ze wasn\u2019t a big deal. However, Lu Yue was one of the exceptions.</p><br/><p>Lu Yue was an emerging photographer. A set of her photos won an international award last year, and she was a regular with many major magazines. Old Fei invited her due to her potential.</p><br/><p>However, Lu Yue had a status that he didn\u2019t know about.</p><br/><p>She was a diehard fan of God Xi!!!</p><br/><p>Five years ago was the first time she saw Xi Ze\u2019s fashion show. Later, she frantically collected this person\u2019s hard copy photos, magazine introductions, endorsement information, film and television appearances\u2026 Lu Yue was a diehard Xi Ze fan!</p><br/><p>Lu Yue never thought that she would actually see God Xi at today\u2019s fashion show.</p><br/><p>If she knew, she would\u2019ve spent the whole day getting her make-up done!</p><br/><p>It was one thing to see Xi Ze, another to go up to him. Before the fashion show opened, Lu Yue clutched her heart in a corner and secretly looked at Xi Ze, not daring to go forward to say anything. Lu Yue waited for the fashion show to start, only to excitedly find out that God Xi was sitting in front of her!!</p><br/><p>Things turned out like this, as if God was saying that she should go to talk to him! Thus, Lu Yue hesitated for a long time before finally mustering the courage to go forward with a piece of paper and pen. She only intended to say a few words with Xi Ze and quickly get a signature.</p><br/><p>\u201cE\u2026Excuse me, Sir\u2026 Could I please get a signature?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second half of Lu Yue\u2019s sentence was completely soft as she clutched the paper and pen.</p><br/><p>Please sign, please sign, be sure to sign!</p><br/><p>Nobody will stop me from getting his signature!</p><br/><p>After listening to Lu Yue\u2019s words, the handsome man sitting in the front row looked slightly sideways and up at her. There was a deep look in his eyes, with a touch of a smile, as Xi Ze spoke in his low voice. \u201cAh? What did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an ordinary sentence and Xi Ze had even made his aura more approachable. But Lu Yue stared at his face for a moment before turning red. She repeated waved her hand and cried out, \u201cNo\u2026 nothing! Nothing!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked at her with surprise, before eventually turning his head away.</p><br/><p>Lu Yue: QAQ! Why did she have to wilt in front of God Xi!</p><br/><p>Lu Yue was filled with grief and indignation when the venue suddenly darkened. In the darkness, Lu Yue became surprised as she and everyone sucked in their breaths. The T stage was actually made from some type of luminous material!</p><br/><p>In the centre of the dim venue, the long T stage flashed silver. This light wasn\u2019t dazzling, but it allowed the T stage to look like crystal. In the darkness, it exuded a brilliant and dreamy feeling.</p><br/><p><em>Snap.</em></p><br/><p><em>Snap.</em></p><br/><p><em>Snap.</em></p><br/><p>After a few consecutive sounds, the spotlights lit up, shining in the middle of the T stage. The crowd saw that the T stage seemed transparent and it was unexpectedly paved with a thin layer of feathers, giving an elegant and ethereal feeling.</p><br/><p>Accompanied by elegant and soothing music, the first runway model appeared.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lu Yue focused all her attention\u2026 well, she focused most of it on the runway show. She was a little distracted by Xi Ze in her peripheral vision. The fashion show was important, God Xi was also important!</p><br/><p>She had to say, Fei Sixin\u2019s fashion show was really carefully decorated. Every model wore clothes that were in line with their temperament, and the double layered effect of the stage gave the audience a full visual feast.</p><br/><p>Lu Yue kept shooting with her SLR and sometimes noticed the model\u2019s clothing.</p><br/><p>After all, Lu Yue was a photographer rather than a designer. She just entered the industry for a few years, so her knowledge of fashion design wasn\u2019t profound. For example, she felt that every set of clothing that Fei Sixin designed was bright and stunning. But if she was questioned, she could only say a few things about the clothing.</p><br/><p>Before coming to this fashion show, Lu Yue heard that the chief model was a complete newcomer!</p><br/><p>The news was \u2018inadvertently\u2019 revealed by Master Fei in an interview, but no one knew the new model\u2019s name. As more and more models walked on the T stage, Lu Yue was looking forward to it. Which newcomer would be the chief model? Who was this new person?</p><br/><p>Lu Yue sneaked at peak at God Xi. Well, they certainly wouldn\u2019t be a match for God Xi, he was the more dazzling\u2026</p><br/><p>A person appeared in her line of sight, causing Lu Yue\u2019s eyes to suddenly widen and her thoughts to completely stop!</p><br/><p>At the end of the T stage, a handsome young man was stepping forward with a smooth pace.</p><br/><p>The T stage was the most common runway style. Xi Ze and Lu Yue sat in front of the T stage. Each model faced them while walking forward, and had their backs to them when walking back. Now Lu Yue had good eyesight and could clearly see the young man in the distance!</p><br/><p>A jade green long cape hung from the youth\u2019s left shoulders and stopped at his left knee. He was wearing a light green vest, with silver embroidery in a beautiful vine pattern.</p><br/><p>He wore pure white pants and walked barefoot on the feathers.</p><br/><p>Once the lights shone on the complex embellishment on his right arm, it reflected off the gems with a gorgeous glitter, leaving everyone feeling astonished at the depth.</p><br/><p>The moment she saw these clothes, a sentence appeared in Lu Yue\u2019s heart\u2014</p><br/><p>[He is the fairy prince from the forest.]</p><br/><p>Today was the first time Lu Yue completely understood the concept that inspired a designer.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t due to the clothing, but the body wearing these clothes!</p><br/><p>His delicate eyes indifferently looked in front of him, his full lips slightly poured as he steadily stepped on the feathers. Every step caused the feathers to move up and down, causing a fantastic effect.</p><br/><p>Just like all the models in the show, the youth\u2019s make-up was minimal, but there was a leaf-like curve drawn in gold at the end of his eyes. When those eyes stared straight ahead, she suddenly saw a noble prince, an arrogant elf\u2026 but that wasn\u2019t it! He was the master and emperor of this forest!</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu came to the front of the T Stage, Lu Yue couldn\u2019t help lifting her SLR, quickly finding the best light and took a photo. After the first photo, she couldn\u2019t help taking a second one.</p><br/><p>Lu Yue was surprised to find that she didn\u2019t have to hesitate when taking the image! In her lends, the youth\u2019s every move was like a painting, as if every action was a freeze frame that would make a beautiful poster.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu walked back and the second wave of models came out. Lu Yue clutched her thumping heart and gasped to herself, \u201cHow can he be so good-looking? He is the new chief model? He is very good\u2026 no no! My life is firmly for God Xi, I won\u2019t climb this wall!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Yue thought this and hurriedly looked at her idol to firm up her belief. However, Lu Yue\u2019s eyes widened the moment she saw Xi Ze\u2019s expression, and she almost exclaimed aloud.</p><br/><p>God Xi was smiling!!!</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t mistaken! She observed God Xi all night, so why was God Xi suddenly smiling?</p><br/><p>Did something interesting happen just now? There was only the new model\u2026</p><br/><p>Eh? Was God Xi smiling because of the new model?</p><br/><p>Lu Yue felt like she learned something incredible today.</p><br/><p>So, in the next wave of catwalks, Lu Yu focused on carefully observing Xi Ze. She saw her idol lean back in his chair and calmly look at the models on the stage. Occasionally, he would speak a few words to his agent next to him.</p><br/><p>But!</p><br/><p>Before long, Lu Yue was amazed to find that her idol suddenly sat straight up and his eyes stared intently at the stage!</p><br/><p>Lu Yue hastened to look\u2014</p><br/><p>A handsome young man wearing a light blue trench coat was walking forward.</p><br/><p>Lu Yue, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She seemed to know too much, she might be silenced\u2026</p><br/><p>Since her own idol appreciated the new model, Lu Yue naturally couldn\u2019t feel guilty about carefully watching this fashion show, especially when Ming Yu appeared.</p><br/><p>After four consecutive waves, Lu Yue became more amazed. Not only did the youth have an excellent appearance, he could show off the flamboyant style of the clothing and dominate the live audience with his momentum!</p><br/><p>Whenever the youth appeared on the stage, you couldn\u2019t help focusing on him. His well-deserved luminosity captured the audience\u2019s eyes and attention!</p><br/><p>In the finale of the show, the youth wore a dark blue suit. The steady aura and mature clothes showed off a unique charm, making people completely ignore the age of this person. They felt like they were seeing someone at the top of the pyramid, an extravagant duke of the kingdom.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s last appearance caused the audience to clap.</p><br/><p>In this round of applause, Lu Yue was the most enthusiastic and also the loudest.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you see that God Xi was clapping? She was applauding with God Xi, so she had to be loud!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

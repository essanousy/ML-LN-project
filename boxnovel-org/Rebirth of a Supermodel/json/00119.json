Then when she was five years old, she encountered a wild bear while hunting with her father in the mountain. Her father actually held off the wild bear with a wooden stick. After two and a half years, Li Ninghan realized the martial arts that her parents knew.</p><br/><p>Li Ninghan had a rare martial arts physique that was born once in a hundred years. Therefore, her parents couldn\u2019t help teaching her martial arts and reminded her, \u201cYou must not leave this mountain. Never show your martial arts to outsiders. Never tell people that your surname is Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three rules lasted until she was 18 years old, when they suddenly broke.</p><br/><p>One day, Li Ninghan came home from hunting only to find her parents stabbed to death in their cabin. There was no resistance despite her parents being so strong in martial arts. This raised Li Ninghan\u2019s suspicions. She sorrowfully packed up her parents\u2019 belongings and discovered a martial arts training book as well as an old diary.</p><br/><p>The diary talked about three people who were apprenticed under the same teacher.</p><br/><p>The first apprentice brother was handsome and skilled in military strategy, while the second apprentice sister was beautiful and optimistic. The youngest apprentice brother had a heavenly beauty. His personality might be eccentric but his martial arts ability was the most outstanding of the three. Therefore, he was most loved by their teacher.</p><br/><p>It was obvious who the first apprentice and second apprentice were.</p><br/><p>Li Ninghan read her mother\u2019s diary and became more horrified.</p><br/><p>The youngest apprentice actually did cruel things like \u2018skin a person for fun\u2019 and \u2018slaughter 100 people just because one of them stepped on his shoes!\u2019</p><br/><p>He was really devoid of human nature, he had no conscience!</p><br/><p>After learning these things, their master directly imprisoned the youngest apprentice in the banned room of the school and ordered him to never come out until he realized his wrongdoings. The first brother and second sister hurriedly tried to make up for the sins committed by their youngest brother.</p><br/><p>However, once they returned to the school, they saw an empty house and empty forbidden room.</p><br/><p>Li Ninghan looked at the words in her mother\u2019s diary and felt numb and hatred at the same time.</p><br/><p>[My youngest brother dressed in red clothes. I don\u2019t know if it was from other people\u2019s blood or his own. That beautiful face was cold and ruthless, never smiling. The sword in his hand descended and the last uncle of the school died under the sword. Brother Li and I knew that we weren\u2019t his opponents and fled in desperation, hiding in the mountains. I\u2019m afraid he\u2026I\u2019m afraid he\u2026]</p><br/><p>After that, there was nothing recorded in the diary.</p><br/><p>However, Li Ninghan already guessed who killed her parents!</p><br/><p>In order to get revenge for her parents, Li Ninghan took out the treasured sword her parents kept in a box and stepped into the martial arts world. On the road, she encountered her first person in the world, An Yucheng. After the two met, the so called \u2018an exchange of blows leading to friendship\u2019, the two people walked side by side.</p><br/><p>An Yucheng was elegant and had high martial arts. Li Li Ninghan couldn\u2019t help herself, despite her cold heart. After experiencing the \u2018Liaowu government mystery case,\u2019 the \u2018Qi Yidao search\u2019 and the \u2018Changping Cliff duel,\u2019 the two people fell in love.</p><br/><p>An Yucheng accompanied Li Ninghan to the rumoured Fire Palace created by Bai Xiu. However, the two people had already stepped into a trap and could no longer go back.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The whole movie\u2019s tone was very traditional and the use of colour was very careful and rigorous. Apart from Ming Yu\u2019s bright red clothes, the rest of the clothing was much simpler.</p><br/><p>Previously, Elder Qi mentioned that Bai Xu\u2019s role was basically in memories. Then whose memories did he appear in? It was in the \u2018memories\u2019 of the heroine who he regarded as \u2018just dust.\u2019</p><br/><p>The heroine always remembered who killed her parents and had nightmares. Later, she experienced hallucinations and mistakenly thought she had seen the heartless killing god Bai Xu.</p><br/><p>Therefore, semi-realistic illusionary procession was required for the latter half of the movie. But the requirement for acting wasn\u2019t very important. After all, in many cases, only Ming Yu\u2019s eyes or chin would be revealed. His full face only appeared at the end.</p><br/><p>Since the first day when he entered the cew and was shocked by Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s acting, Fang Liangxiu completely took Ming Xiaoyu as a model with acting skill. It was unknown if Ming Xiaoyu was hit by something, but the next few scenes were very easy to pass. Even the acting wasn\u2019t bad!</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Fang Liangxiu secretly sent a message to a certain man. \u3010 MIng Yu\u2019s acting is very good. Why do you want me to take care of him? \u3011</p><br/><p>Xi Ze who saw this message, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Xi Ze closed his eyes and carefully read it again.</p><br/><p>\u2026He didn\u2019t see it wrong.</p><br/><p>Originally, Director Xu\u2019s requirements for Ming Yu\u2019s acting wasn\u2019t too high. Now that Ming Xiaoyu actually gave him such a big surprise, Director Xu was naturally joyful.</p><br/><p>Did Ming Xiaoyu open a blocked vein and suddenly gained the ability to act?</p><br/><p>Did squatting in a corner to ponder over the plot really play a big role?</p><br/><p>Did the squatting small mushroom became a mushroom god and gained acting skills?</p><br/><p>Of course not!</p><br/><p>Xiao Biqing won the three main Huaxia awards but this didn\u2019t mean she only received those awards. Xiao Biqing accompanied the small mushroom in the corner for a few days. If Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t make any breakthroughs then Xiao Biqing would feel sorry she received all those awards.</p><br/><p>Fang Liangxiu naturally wasn\u2019t aware of all this and wondered why Ming XIaoyu and Xiao Biqing were always squatting in a corner. What were they whispering?</p><br/><p>Once Fang Liangxiu told Xi Ze about this matter, Xi Ze\u2019s face turned dark. He quickly asked Fang Liangxiu to find a chance to see what they were talking about. Fang Liangxiu was also curious and found a chance to join.</p><br/><p>Now Fang Liangxiu discovered that the squatting people were actually exchanging acting tips!</p><br/><p>So conscientious! No wonder Xiao Biqing was a three awards actress, no wonder Ming Yu\u2019s acting was so good!</p><br/><p>Yes! He also wanted to study like these two people!</p><br/><p>Thus, one more small mushroom appeared in the An Li cast.</p><br/><p>The male and female protagonists were squatting with Ming Xiaoyu. Wouldn\u2019t the other actors feel curious? Therefore, the second female Wang Yueyao quietly squatted down and then the third male Feng Jiaye also joined.</p><br/><p>One small mushroom, two small mushrooms, three small mushrooms\u2026</p><br/><p>As the spring breeze blew, countless small mushrooms appeared in the An Li crew.</p><br/><p>Since the beginning of July, the entire H City received hot weather. It was almost 30 degrees Celsius every day and it was unbearable for all the staff members. If this was true for the staff wearing short-sleeves, it was even more painful for the actors wearing thick clothing. Among them, the one in most pain should be Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiu was a small role but his costumes had the most thought and effort put into it.</p><br/><p>Do you know how thick the red silk fabric was? Do you know how hot the long hair that couldn\u2019t be tied up was?</p><br/><p>Like a sack, all the heat was wrapped around the body and couldn\u2019t escape!</p><br/><p>Luo Ru was distressed seeing Ming Xiaoyu like this and for the time being, he temporarily stopped drinking the medicinal soup. However, Ming Yu didn\u2019t appear to care. Once it was his turn to shoot, he just wiped the sweat on his forehead and asked Sister Zheng to fix his makeup. Then he entered the studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yu is too dedicated. I saw all the sweat on the back of his hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the clothes are so thick but he wears them all day in order to prevent the clothes from being worn out from being taken on and off to much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As long as you made an effort, everyone would see it.</p><br/><p>Xu Yizong also saw Ming Yu\u2019s actions. Thus, even if Ming Yu NGed a few times, he didn\u2019t scold Ming Yu. He just wrinkled his eyebrows, mentioned a few things and told Ming Xiaoyu to pay more attention.</p><br/><p>And today\u2019s last scene was a rain scene.</p><br/><p>This scene would later be edited into the heroine\u2019s nightmare. In the dream, Bai Xiu was fighting her parents and finally sliced her parents with his sword, staining the river with blood.</p><br/><p>Black clouds pressed down in the sky above the town, leaving everyone breathless. Large raindrops fell into the river, causing ripples. Water splashed and time seemed to freeze.</p><br/><p>The rain was too heavy. Any individual would feel somewhat embarrassed in it. However, one person was standing calm and graceful in this rain. It was as if he wasn\u2019t wet from the rain. He was just staring at the whole world with contempt.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wore a tight red robe in this scene. The reason why it was always red was because in the heroine\u2019s diary, it was written: My younger brother always loved red clothes, the colour like blood. In retrospect, I\u2019m afraid he was always bloodthirsty\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus, in the heroine\u2019s nightmares and hallucinations, Bai Xiu was always wearing red.</p><br/><p>In this storm, Bai Xiu stared at his senior brother and sister but his eyes didn\u2019t contain any friendship. Without giving the two people a chance to speak, his sword moved aggressively. He defeated both people within ten strikes, making them lost their lives.</p><br/><p>At this time, raindrops dripped down his black hair. The beautiful face of the youth was even more brilliant, as if he was a devil who climbed from hell. His body was covered in blood as he stepped in the direction of the camera.</p><br/><p>His footsteps caused cold air to blow in the hearts of everyone in the crew.</p><br/><p>He dragged his sword, the tip of the blade dripping blood. His cold and ruthless appearance made it impossible for people to move. They could only watch him approach step by step.</p><br/><p>This scene had been NG three times already. If the NG continued, the actors\u2019 bodies wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand it since it was a rain scene. The director would have to decided if he wanted to shoot the scene tomorrow. But at this time, MIng Yu showed unexpected acting. He really seemed like a bloodthirsty god, his beautiful face and cold temperament making people shiver.</p><br/><p>Once the scene ended, Fang Liangxiu couldn\u2019t help sending a message to Xi Ze. \u3010 Xi Ze, what is your relationship with Ming Xiaoyu? The scene he just filmed was really good. I saw a lot of staff members blushing. Do I need to help you block some of them? \u3011</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026^\uff3f^#####!\u201d</p><br/><p>Where did the rivals come from?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, if he didn\u2019t trap the mushroom in his own garden, this small mushroom would be dug away sooner or later!</p><br/><p>In H City, the busy filming schedule continued. In the capital, Xi Ze stepped up his pace as he prepared for the high-end fashion show at the end of July, while also secretly planning how to explore a certain job site and assert his sovereignty.</p><br/><p>The next morning, an advertisement suddenly appeared on TV, once again setting off a \u2018Smoke\u2019 fragrance frenzy in the country.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The salty taste of the sea blew ashore on the sea breeze. The sun was hot but not sinister. It shone warmly on the body and there was a romantic taste in the air.</p><br/><p>Since Xi Ze took his lover out on a holiday, he naturally arranged everything. The luggage was packed and the place of accommodation prepared. A secluded island where the two of them were the only people in the world was the best.</p><br/><p>Night hadn\u2019t arrived yet. There were no fluctuations on Mr. Xi\u2019s handsome face but currents were surging in his heart.</p><br/><p>A smooth white beach, uh, beach play \u221a</p><br/><p>A spacious and clear pool, well, pool play \u221a</p><br/><p>The blue sky, the ocean breeze, the empty island, a couple who loved each other\u2026</p><br/><p>No, he was getting a nosebleed! o(*\u2267\u25bd\u2266)\u30c4!!!</p><br/><p>From the moment he set foot on the small island, Mr. Xi\u2019s brain theatre began. Ming Xiaoyu had been with this man for many years but he hadn\u2019t completed the mind-reading technique. Therefore, he didn\u2019t think too much as he started to unpack his things.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say hello this time but I don\u2019t blame you. This place is really beautiful. You should\u2019ve time me earlier so I could prepare properly. Ding Bo\u2019s packing has some things missing but it isn\u2019t a big problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze hummed and looked forward to the upcoming night.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu spent the morning unpacking his things and then in the afternoon, the two of them went to the beach to play. Xi Ze could swim but he didn\u2019t like water. Therefore, he just lay on the beach and bask in the sun. Ming Yu ridiculed him as a \u2018dry duck.\u2019</p><br/><p>Was Mr. Xi a dry duck?</p><br/><p>Mr Xi: Wait for the pool play in the evening. Then he would personally tell the answer to Small Mushroom.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calculated thousands of things and thought he took everything into account. He didn\u2019t think that as the sky was darkening and the two of them started heading back, a yacht roared on the sea and stopped 10 metres away from the two.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A pair of slender legs, sexy hair and a skinny body emerged from the yacht. When Du Ruo suddenly appeared here, Ming Yu was stunned and stared at Xi Ze with surprise.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t have to wait long for an answer as a familiar figure appeared on the yacht.</p><br/><p>He Chaoman looked at Ming Yu and Xi Ze with amazement. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips thinned and his eyebrows raised, a very cold wind blowing from him. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>This so-called wise man was at a loss!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze chose an uninhabited island under his name and thought they would be able to live in a world with just the two of them. He didn\u2019t expect that He Chaoman would unexpectedly choose this small island when going on vacation with Du Ruo!</p><br/><p>This island might be under Xi Ze\u2019s name but half a year ago, it still belonged to his body. As someone who hardly ever left her house, He Chaoman didn\u2019t know that this island now belonged to Xi Ze. Du Ruo came to her for a holiday and said she hoped to experience the scenery of a tropical beach. Therefore, He Chaoman first thought about this place.</p><br/><p>Deep in the night, the two men and two women sat by a fire and roasted meat.</p><br/><p>The fire shook due to the sea breeze and the sound of the meat roasting filled the air. Spicy powder and salt were sprinkled on the pieces of meat. The spicy and tempting smell filled the air.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu flipped the piece of meat while Xi Ze remained silent with a cold expression. He Chaoman was playing with her phone while Du Ruo touched her arm, feeling that the temperature here was lower than Huaxia.</p><br/><p>Once the meat was ready, Ming Yu opened his mouth and broke the silence. However, Xi Ze still had a \u2018you owe me 5 million\u2019 expression on his face. MINg Xiaoyu knew that this man was releasing air-conditioning again.</p><br/><p>The evening Mr. Xi hoped for had arrived but Mr. Xi was full of anger.</p><br/><p>After eating the meat, Xi Ze said solemnly to He Chaoman, \u201cLittle aunt, you will leave tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Chaoman was shaken by the words \u2018little aunt\u2019 but then unexpectedly said, \u201cWhy should we leave? Big nephew, you have to respect the old and love the young. I am your elder and you should respect me. I am also younger than you and you should love the young. A holiday is to relax and it will be lively with more people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s face darkened as he whispered, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dangerous atmosphere instantly spread out, causing He Chaoman to gulp and finally surrender. \u201cAdenes is so annoying. Recently, she has stayed in Huaxia for a long time and is always har\u2026. cough, always harassing me. I\u2019m hiding from her. I promise, I will absolutely leave in three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu probably guessed the reason why Xi Ze was uncomfortable and didn\u2019t have any further exchanges with He Chaoman and Du Ruo. Instead, he turned around and comforted his lover. \u201cIt is good for everyone to play together. We can be alone after they are gone so don\u2019t care about this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s depressed mood was somewhat alleviated when he heard Ming Yu\u2019s low voice.</p><br/><p>His expression didn\u2019t change this evening but his heart had long been depressed. After pushing down his mushroom, Ming Yu counterattacked and Xi Ze was pressed under his body. The two of them kissed on the sofa for a long time and finally moved to the bed.</p><br/><p>A moment before the battle, Xi Ze suddenly stopped moving and turned to look at the door. He coughed softly and there was an echo from outside the house before there was the sound of someone fleeing.</p><br/><p>Then Xi Ze turned back around and gently entered his lover.</p><br/><p>They already broke the world of the two people and now they wanted to listen? Weren\u2019t they afraid?</p><br/><p>Once the fierce sex ended, Xi Ze lightly held his naked mushroom and gently kneaded the soft arm while whispering, \u201cThis time is just a short thing. Once you have a bit more time, we will travel around the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he heard this, Ming Yu\u2019s sleepiness suddenly disappeared.</p><br/><p>He turned over in amazement and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by travelling around the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s eyes narrowed and he smiled. \u201cI mean it literally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you mean for us to travel around the world someday? Travelling around the world isn\u2019t a problem but the time is important. Are you sure you have time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cIf you have the time, I will have time.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Xi Ze didn\u2019t wait for Ming Xiaoyu to reply as he gently hugged and whispered to Ming Yu, \u201cAfter marriage, we haven\u2019t gone on a honeymoon yet. The next time it will be just the two of us, with no other people and we will go everywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze asked, \u201c\u2026You still have to think about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu sneered. \u201cIf you make me a delicious table of food tomorrow, I will seriously consider it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips thinned and his expression darkened. \u201cI don\u2019t cook for others.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was stunned\u2019 That is Sister Du and your little aunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t my lover. I have no need to feed them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour behaviour right now reminds me of a saying. The woman\u2026 cough, the man who wants to control another man must first win over his stomach.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the one who married me, my little wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu sneered. \u201cYou forced me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled. \u201cIt is because you looked very beautiful in that wedding dress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, get lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu kicked at Xi Ze\u2019s body. However, the size of the bed was large enough for two big men to lie on. How could such large movement be accepted? Ming Yu just raised his leg when Xi Ze grabbed it, stopping him from moving.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu hadn\u2019t been able to respond when Xi Ze\u2019s fingers rubbed him.</p><br/><p>Was there really something in the world like a pure chat under the blankets?</p><br/><p>It was just time for recharge!</p><br/><p>Mr. Xi had raised his energy and now it was time to show it off.</p><br/><p>Soon there was the sound of the headboard moving and Ming Yu cursing, \u201cWhat is this posture? My waist is going to break. Get lost!\u201d and Xi Ze replying, \u201cGood, this is deeper.\u201d Perhaps it was to make up for the beach play, the pool play and all types of plays. This time, Xi Ze was at full strength and did some actions that really made Ming Xiaoyu blush.</p><br/><p>This time, there was a low groan and Ming Yu muttered, \u201cI want to cut you.\u201d</p><br/><p>But this type of condemnation was just flirting for Mr. X and made him move harder.</p><br/><p>It was only two times but Ming Yu was so tired that he lay limply on the bed.</p><br/><p>Even so, Mr. Xi was still energetic and wanted to tease. Once he came again the third time, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes reddened and he scolded the sky. \u201cI am only 22 years old! Why do I feel that a 30 year old is more energetic than I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>The seven year older Xi Ze\u2019s face darkened before he laughed. \u201cA 30 year old man is as fierce as a tiger.\u201d</p><br/><p>This evening, Ming Yu was helpless under this uncontrolled tiger.</p><br/><p>Three days later, to He Chaoman\u2019s regret and Du Ruo\u2019s helplessness, the two of them looked at Xi Ze\u2019s cold face and finally left with disappointment.</p><br/><p>Once he saw the two beauties leaving, Ming Yu sighed emotionally. \u201cIt is really incomprehensible. A holiday with two beauties, how many people would dream of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s overbearing hot breath suddenly filled his mouth, causing Ming Yu to respond enthusiastically. Standing on the sandy beach, Ming Yu was suddenly pulled to Xi Ze\u2019s body and started to counterattack. But this behaviour only caused Xi Ze to be stunned for a moment before he held the youth\u2019s head with one hand and used his height advantage to fiercely kiss Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>The height difference of 7 cm meant Ming Yu had to raise his head to kiss his lover.</p><br/><p>This caused Ming Yu\u2019s resistance to disappear more and more. Once the kiss was over, a strand of silver was at the corner of their lips and Ming Yu\u2019s lips were bright red and full.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have been working all your life and don\u2019t know how to rest well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s low voice caused Ming Yu to look up at him with astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can be sure if a sickness is related to fatigue but you are pushing yourself too hard, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu laughed. \u201cYou are saying this to me? Who was the one who abruptly fell unconscious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow at the youth\u2019s teasing and continued, \u201cI will let you rest well in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, is it really no problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I say there is no problem then it is no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be so shameless? I will divorce you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really want a divorce?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s suddenly serious words made Ming Yu stunned. After a moment, he whispered, \u201cMr. Xi, I\u2019ve thought about it carefully. I am in the prime of my life while you are old. I am getting the short end of the straw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze thoughtfully hummed. He didn\u2019t wait for Ming Yu\u2019s response when he suddenly picked up the youth.</p><br/><p>In the face of Ming Yu\u2019s startled expression, Xi Ze solemnly stated, \u201cIn order to avoid being unable to satisfy my lover, I have decided to do my job seriously starting from today. I can\u2019t let my lover suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what do you mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze mused, \u201cThere is a nice pool behind the house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026That isn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze sighed. \u201cI had good scripts but the lack of external conditions meant they couldn\u2019t be acted out. This is a great opportunity to train your acting skills. I will sacrifice myself and act out the scene with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of here!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this but Ming Yu didn\u2019t mean to struggle at all. Instead, his eyes rolled as he started to recall a possible script. From what he recalled, the script was adapted from the fairy tale the Little Mermaid\u2026</p><br/><p>The more he remembered, the better he felt.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s eyes narrowed and he licked his lips. His behaviour was seen by Xi Ze and he understood that his mushroom liked it.</p><br/><p>How many years had they been unable to act out this script? To be able to play again, it was amazing!</p><br/><p>Needless to say, the two of them rushed off the beach and headed to the pool behind the house. But this time, Xi Ze was just about to leave the beach when he heard a familiar sound from behind him. Xi Ze and Ming Yu stiffened and the two people turned back to look.</p><br/><p>They saw a speedboat splitting apart the waves on the sea.</p><br/><p>A handsome man stood on the bow and waved his hands. By his side, a gentle-looking man was looking down at the map, his hand holding the excited man\u2019s clothes so that he didn\u2019t fall out the boat.</p><br/><p>Luo Cheng, \u201cHey Ming Yu! You\u2019re here! Let\u2019s go on holiday together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze and Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026(/= _ =)/~\u2534\u2534!!\u201d</p><br/><p>What type of grudges did God have against them?!!</p><hr/><br/><p><strong>TL: This is the official end of the story between Xi Ze and Ming Yu. Thank you for joining me on this journey and I will miss our favourite black-bellied couple. </strong></p><br/><p>Like I said, at the moment I\u2019m probably not going to translate the side story between Luo Cheng and Song Chuci. Therefore, this story will officially be marked complete for now.</p><br/><p>As for my next project, I already have it picked out. It is a gaming novel, similar to the King\u2019s Avatar but with BL. I will take a short break before posting it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He lightly placed the small bowl on the table and asked in a confused manner. \u201cYou know a lot about my itinerary and even knew what happened when I was recording on the island. This\u2026\u201d Ming Yu paused before continuing. \u201cYes, is this what Sister Du told you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze shook his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say you were sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means Sister Du told you other things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t think much about this issue because in certain aspects, he also had a strong desire for control. Assuming that he was a designer and Xi Ze the model he was interested in, Ming Yu would also use various means to make Xi Ze care about him. Ming Yu might be even more intimate than Xi Ze was now.</p><br/><p>As long as the other person wasn\u2019t malicious and cared for him, Ming Yu didn\u2019t mind the man\u2019s actions of having informants. His morale requirements weren\u2019t high.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze stayed silent and didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, Ming Yu understood the other person\u2019s words by default. He didn\u2019t care too much and kept talking. \u201cSince you know the situation of my jobs, you should know that I endorsed the Nideland Smoke perfumes. Isn\u2019t the promotional effect very good?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Xi Ze lightly nodded and handed the porcelain bowl to Ming Yu. \u201cEat the porridge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026Weren\u2019t we talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze who was still holding the bowl. \u201cWe can talk while you eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu felt that it was strange to listen to this man\u2019s words and to talk about such a serious topic when eating glutinous rice porridge! Sometimes he would take a few sips, put down the porridge and speak a few words, then eat from the bowl again!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thought, \u2018I don\u2019t look solemn at all!!! \uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u2019 But Ming Xiaoyu, do you think that sitting in bed and talking about serious matters is solemn\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this matter has nothing to do with you. Did Shen Xiang assist in the publicity?\u201d Ming Yu thought carefully before saying, \u201cIn fact, there is a loophole in what you said. My current momentum is good, but it isn\u2019t enough to make Shen Xiang promote me to this extent. Brother Zhao said that Shen Xiang pays attention to the Muse models according to rating. Can you tell me what level I am at now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t expect the youth to unexpectedly cut to the key part of the problem. He was startled and stared seriously into the youth\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>This contact gave Xi Ze a deeper understanding of Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>This youth was quite clever and intelligent.</p><br/><p>The two words weren\u2019t repeated. Ming Yu\u2019s IQ was high and his memory was good. He had a wide range of knowledge for a model and a first-class sense of aesthetics. This intelligence was supplemented by Ming Yu\u2019s cleverness. His emotional quotient was high, he carefully observed small details and he had a good grasp of human nature.</p><br/><p>If Ming Yu had questioned his level of concern a few months ago, it would\u2019ve been impossible to ask Xi Ze in person. It was because at that time, their relationship wasn\u2019t close enough. He paid close attention to human emotions.</p><br/><p>Now Ming Xiaoyu knew that Xi Ze would happily answer this small question.</p><br/><p>It also indicated that Ming Yu\u2019s heart treated Xi Ze in a manner different to the vast majority of the world, maybe even everyone else.</p><br/><p>The handsome and noble man couldn\u2019t help feeling good as he thought this. His lips curved and he whispered, \u201cThe same level as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was stunned when he heard the words, his spoon even freezing in the air. It took him a moment to digest the meaning of \u2018The same level as me.\u2019 Then Ming Xiaoyu frowned and asked, \u201cXi Ze, aren\u2019t you too good to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made a surprised expression. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu replied, \u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s put aside the level of concern in the company. Just look at the bowl of porridge and side dishes in front of him. Even if they weren\u2019t made with Xi Ze\u2019s own hands, he had ordered the take away. At the same time, Xi Ze stayed at his house since morning and took care of him until now.</p><br/><p>If this wasn\u2019t \u2018good\u2019, then what could be considered good?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t immediately answer the youth\u2019s question. His black eyes were like deep pools as he quietly stared at Ming Yu. The emotions in his eyes were very complex, but Ming Yu didn\u2019t avoid the other person\u2019s gaze. Rather, he calmly confronted it.</p><br/><p>The two men watched each other for a long time before Xi Ze whispered, \u201cWell, I guess so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, you are a little irritating today!!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was probably aware of the youth\u2019s gloomy mood but couldn\u2019t help smiling as he used his chopsticks to help Ming Yu with a few dishes. He held the vegetables and said quietly, \u201cI have been telling you from a long time ago that you are my muse, my source of inspiration. The picture I drew of you earlier, I got a good inspiration from it. Perhaps you can see the clothing in the next Ji and Ya show. And if you agree to be my model, I will treat you better than I am now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu heard this and subconsciously asked, \u201cIs it only if I become your model?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s hands paused during the motion of selecting vegetables. After a short time, he shook his head and said, \u201cThere is another way that I can treat you 10,000 times better than \u2018being my model\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t ask and XiZe didn\u2019t say anything more.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu still had a bit of a cold and his appetite wasn\u2019t very strong. If the porridge and side dishes hadn\u2019t been too delicious, he wouldn\u2019t have eaten so much. Once Ming Yu\u2019s stomach felt full, Xi Ze removed the dishes. Ming Yu smiled and asked, \u201cThis restaurant\u2019s food is really good. Where did you order it from Xi Ze?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was startled by the words. He turned seriously and emphasized, \u201cI, made, all, of, it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that this man insisted \u2018the food was all his own\u2019, Ming Yu could only nod helplessly. \u201cYes, you made it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xi Ze was walking towards the door, the youth\u2019s low and hoarse voice suddenly rang out in the room. \u201cXi Ze, I really want to thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s footsteps suddenly paused. He turned to look at the youth behind him raising an eyebrow and asking, \u201cAre you thanking me for making such a delicious meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the bright and dazzling lights, the pale youth\u2019s lips slightly curved, looking like a splendid spring flower, a type of sick beauty. He coked his head and solemnly continued, \u201cIt isn\u2019t just for these things, but all the things you have done. Whether I know it or not, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words made Xi Ze feel startled for a very long time. Then he gave a low laugh. \u201cA long time ago, I said I wouldn\u2019t accept verbal thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu asked, \u201c\u2026Ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat practical actions are you planning to use to thank me? For example, being my model?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll take back my thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>His sickness came and went quickly.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because Xi Ze really took care of him. Ming Yu didn\u2019t know what Xi Ze did, but he woke up feeling a lot better. The next day, there were no symptoms apart from some dryness in his throat.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was very busy but the next day, he still came downstairs to measure Ming Yu\u2019s temperature. After confirming that there was no fever and his physical condition was much better, Xi Ze assured Ming Yu that he could freely move.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at the man\u2019s serious appearance and couldn\u2019t help murmuring, \u201cAre you sure your surname isn\u2019t Wang\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The confused Xi Ze, \u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaxia has an old saying: If you have difficulties, I will help. I live next door and my surname is Wang.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The old Huaxia saying, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After lunch, Mr. Xi, who might be surnamed Wang, left Ming Yu\u2019s house first in order to let him rest. But Ming Yu wasn\u2019t a person who could be still. He had two or three days of rest and felt that his body was completely good. Thus, on Zhao Rui\u2019s advice, he attended a fashion show organized by a fashion magazine.</p><br/><p>Occasionally, magazines would hold fashion shows and invited several good fashion brands to display a series of clothing. The one that Ming Yu attended was the exclusive fashion show of his old collaborator, Character.</p><br/><p>Unknowingly, Ming Yu had acquired quite a high status in the industry.</p><br/><p>In particular, the recent Nidelan advertisements overwhelmed people\u2019s attention. Once Ming Yu entered the fashion show\u2019s venue, many celebrities in the industry wanted to talk to him. Luo Ru smiled from beside him and accepted the business cards.</p><br/><p>Once the fashion show was about to begin, Ming Yu found that sitting behind him was unexpectedly Wu Yuzhen!</p><br/><p>Sir Wu was just as handsome as he was six months ago. Ming Yu chatted with him for a while before the fashion show began.</p><br/><p>Half a year ago, Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian were considered the best performers in the fashion industry in recent years and Ming Yu could only occupy a small section with them in Character. This indicated the reputation of the other party. Today, when Character sent an invitation to them, Ming Yu\u2019s seat was placed in front of Wu Yuzhen. This showed how the world had changed in six months.</p><br/><p>Small companies had the advantages of small companies, but large companies also had the advantages of large companies.</p><br/><p>In a small company, Wu Yuzhen could get all the best resources and opportunities. In a big company, if Ming Yu had no strength and didn\u2019t try hard to go up, the good resources wouldn\u2019t come to him.</p><br/><p>However, once in a big company, the resources obtain were incomparable to the small companies.</p><br/><p>Once the fashion show ended, Ming Yu invited Wu Yuzhen to attend his birthday dinner next month. Wu Yuzhen easily smiled and agreed. There was no need to have too many barriers between friends. Ming Yu might\u2019ve risen quite rapidly in the past half a year and surpassed Wu Yuzhen, but Wu Yuzhen didn\u2019t mind it.</p><br/><p>Only a small and weak-minded person would envy the growth of others instead of working hard.</p><br/><p>After the fashion show ended, Ming Yu thought up a plan to change houses.</p><hr/><br/><p>TL: From Hahachn\u2019s Internet Slang Glossary: Next door+Old Wang. Mr. Wang who lives next door. This Internet slang term has two meanings: 1) The secret lover of one\u2019s wife. 2) Someone else\u2019s husband whom a woman often deems better than her own. She often annoyingly compares her own husband with that alpha male neighbor/friend/acquaintance hoping to inspire the husband to catch up with the \u201crole model.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

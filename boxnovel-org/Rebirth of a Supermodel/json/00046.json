Even the gem embellishments were harsh to the point of millimetres. There were only 15 brands in the world that could hold a high-end fashion show, and Ji and Ya represented the highest standards in Huaxia.</p><br/><p>This morning, Zhou Wei Zhuo mentioned that Xi Ze was very busy recently and he rarely came to Muse. Ming Yu didn\u2019t think that after hearing this, he would unexpectedly meet this man in the Muse building.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s left hand was inserted in his coat pockets. He smiled at the youth\u2019s words and said, \u201cI found time to come over. I have a responsible assistant and Ding Bo is taking care of things, so there isn\u2019t a big problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu gently nodded. \u201cAh, you came to the company to deal with something?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice fell and Ming Yu looked up at the man. Ming Yu didn\u2019t want to admit it, but the height difference of nearly 10cm meant he had to look up. Meanwhile, Xi Ze\u2019s eyes slightly drooped as he looked down at the youth.</p><br/><p>The two people stared at each other and then Ming Yu laughed. \u201cIt looks like you came to find me?\u201d He thought carefully for a moment before asking, \u201cIt is impossible that you are looking at me for high-fashion things. Why did you come to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow at the youth\u2019s rational analysis. \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be high-fashion things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu waved his hands and explained. \u201cI heard from Sister Wei that Ji and Ya is doing womenswear during this period. Do you still want to get inspiration from me about womenswear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s narrowed eyes slowly widened at the words. It was like he was seeing a new world as he looked into the youth\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu suddenly felt a chill that went from his brain to his feet. His mouth slightly twitched as he cried out, \u201cI was joking! Don\u2019t take it seriously. You can\u2019t\u2026get any inspiration from me about womenswear! You wouldn\u2019t find it anyway!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark eyes flashed as Xi Ze gave a rare smile and meaningfully said, \u201cIt is hard to say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>This joke wasn\u2019t funny!!!</p><br/><p>They took a few steps and soon arrived in front of the elevator. Ming Yu would naturally go up to his own lounge where Zhao Rui and Luo Ru were waiting for him. He stopped in front of the elevator when he suddenly thought of something. \u201cYes, today you deprived me of a meal. Therefore, shouldn\u2019t you invite me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth smiled slyly. \u201cZeng Shu invited me to eat, and later you said you would buy a meal for Brother Yuan. But I can\u2019t go back and join their dinner. Then don\u2019t you owe me a meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teenager didn\u2019t hide his pride as he sent Xi Ze a provocative look.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu seldom revealed such an expression. Perhaps it was because today, this man kindly helped him and ensured that he wasn\u2019t bullied. He was in a good mood, so he decided to show a bit of his nature.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze chuckled at these words and asked, \u201cThen today, apart from buying those four people a dinner, I have to invite a friend for a meal. And finally\u2026 I have an invitation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was startled. He had been planning to press the elevator button when his hand froze in the air. He turned to Xi Ze with amazement and asked, \u201cDid you come to give me an invitation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze nodded, \u201cYes, I came to give you an invitation.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xi Ze spoke, he pulled two thin cards from his coat pocket and casually handed them to Ming Yu. His movements were careless, but Ming Yu solemnly accepted the two invitations and carefully observed them.</p><br/><p>They were two palm-sized silver envelopes. It was thin and seemed to have no sense of quality, but when it was rubbed with the fingers, it was smooth and felt thick like a metal.</p><br/><p>The invitation had a silver background with cold red lines over it. \u2018Ji and Ya\u2019 was written beautifully, red strokes on a silvery background. It was similar to steel vines climbing upwards.</p><br/><p>The logo of \u2018Ji and Ya\u2019 printed on the outside seemed simple and classy, but it was sufficiently attractive.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu stared for so long that Xi Ze thought he mistook the envelopes for the invitation. Thus, he explained, \u201cThere are invitations inside. I wrote your name on one of them. You can give the second one to whoever you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>He really came to give Ming Yu this gift, so Ming Yu said gratefully, \u201cIt is really hard for you to deliberately take this trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cIsn\u2019t it really hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>The thin lips slightly curved as Xi Ze said with a sigh, \u201cWell, I will count today\u2019s labour as the dinner I owe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu: #$#!#%!#%!#%!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t ask Xi Ze to treat him to a meal because Xi Ze really was very busy. They had both just walked into the elevator when Ding Bo called. Thus, Xi Ze chose to send Ming Yu upstairs before going down again.</p><br/><p>But Ming Yu didn\u2019t accept this suggestion, directly pressing the button for the B2 level. Xi Ze looked on with surprise as the elevated arrived on the B2 floor. He entered the parking lot and left immediately.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Xi Ze pressed something on Ming Yu\u2019s phone and said, \u201cMing Yu, I am busy recently. Feel free to contact me.\u201d Then he rushed away.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu narrowed his eyes and thoughtfully looked at that upright figure that slowly disappeared into the dimly lit parking lot for a long time. Then once the elevator doors automatically closed, he looked at his own reflection in the metal elevator doors and sighed.</p><br/><p>The sudden appearance of Xi Ze was a really big surprise.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why, but when his wrist was suddenly grabbed by the other person, he felt a sudden peace of mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it the timely assistance? Helping a person in need?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to ignore the warmth filling his heart, but it was hard.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui and Luo Ru were waiting for Ming Yu in his lounge, and also had plans to go downstairs to the training department to find him. They didn\u2019t know what happened today and decided to wait for the normal time when classes would end. Thus, they were both surprised when Ming Yu suddenly appeared at the door of the lounge.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui reacted first. \u201cThe course finished early?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu explained a little bit about what happened today. His tone was calm, without any bias, but Zhao Rui gritted his teeth and even Luo Ru involuntarily frowned.</p><br/><p>Once he heard that \u2018Zeng Shu took Lu Zhenxi away,\u2019 Zhao Rui finally couldn\u2019t help exclaiming, \u201cIsn\u2019t Zeng Shu too much? No matter what, we are both still agents of the same company. Why is he always aiming at me? I heard that the reason why Cheng Su wanted to change agents and also succeeded was due to Zeng Shu\u2019s mischief.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui looked at Ming Yu apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Ming Yu. Zeng Shu did this because of me, it is my responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu shook his head. \u201cHe was only defending his model.\u201d Ming Yu paused before continuing. \u201cBut then\u2026 Xi Ze came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru and Zhao Rui, \u201c\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, Ming Yu explained that Xi Ze helped settle things and also mentioned that Zeng Shu would come here tomorrow with Lu Zhenxi to apologize. Zhao Rui instantly forgot about \u2018Xi Ze coming to find you specifically\u2019 and cried out, \u201cGood! I will wait for that Zeng Shu tomorrow! I\u2019d like to see what he has to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026Brother Zhao, you might want to avoid seeing him tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026Ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at Zhao Rui with sincere eyes and solemnly said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this matter bigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The implication was: Zeng Shu might go crazy if he sees you. And if you see Zeng Shu\u2026\u2019 This image was too extreme. He wanted to stop it from happening.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026Hmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ming Yu, when they arrived at the Muse building the next morning, they saw Zeng Shu and Lu Zhenxi in front of the lounge, like they had been waiting for a long time.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui snorted and temporarily went into the toilet to avoid facing Zeng Shu. Then Ming Yu and Luo Ru walked forward together to accept Zeng Shu and Lu Zhenxi\u2019s apology.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Zeng Shu\u2019s eyes stayed on Luo Ru for a long time before he asked Ming Yu, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Zhao Rui. He didn\u2019t come to the company today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was slightly surprised while Luo Ru calmly replied, \u201cBrother Zhao is a little late today. He is stuck in a traffic jam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu nodded, seemingly believing Luo Ru\u2019s words. Just as he was walking past Ming Yu, he stopped and whispered something in Ming Yu\u2019s ear. Then! Ming Yu\u2019s eyes widened with shock and he turned his head, watching Zeng Shu and Lu Zhenxi leave.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, who had been waiting to the side for a long time, finally entered the lounge and hurriedly asked, \u201cXiaoyu, what did that Zeng Shu kid whisper to you? I saw it! Is he talking bad about me again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru also looked at Ming Yu curiously. The young man\u2019s lips helplessly curved and he nodded. \u201cYes, Zeng Shu told me one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. He gnashed his teeth together and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at Zhao Rui\u2019s face for a long time, then his eyes slowly lowered until they stopped at Zhao Rui\u2019s lower body. He shook his head and reluctantly spoke. \u201cZeng Shu said: Zhao Rui is too sloppy. He didn\u2019t even hide well. You can tell him that his fly\u2026 is open.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c!!!!\u201d Luo Ru immediately turned and covered her eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui hurriedly pulled up his zipper while exclaiming indignantly, \u201cZeng Shu! You and I are irrevocably opposed!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

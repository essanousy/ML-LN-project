In front of the white set, two tall and handsome men were standing at an arm\u2019s distance.</p><br/><p>Andrew Warren could become a supermodel and he naturally had advantages. He was 191cm tall, his figure was relatively good and his face was more in line with the mainstream aesthetic of the West. The blond hair and blue eyes was the authentic appearance of a Western supermodel.</p><br/><p>Andrew\u2019s height might not be tall among the male models but he was still a few centimeters taller than Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Since reaching 188cm a few months ago, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s height had barely gone up. This height was quite normal for Huaxia male models yet Ming Yu was very dissatisfied and was still trying to grow taller.</p><br/><p>But Mushroom wanting to grow taller was one thing. Whether he could grow taller was another matter. After all, he was now 18 years old. He was still in the development stage but he had long missed the golden growth period. It would be hard for him to grow taller in the future.</p><br/><p>As a result, the 3cm height difference caused people to subconsciously think that Ming Yu\u2019s presence might be slightly weaker than Andrew\u2019s.</p><br/><p>However! Once the two people really stood together, everyone was amazed. They unexpectedly found that this young man might be casually smiling at the camera but his calm and stable temperament and his majestic aura completely highlighted him.</p><br/><p>The two men standing together felt like an ordinary knight guarding a noble king!</p><br/><p>In the eyes of ordinary people, the knight had enough momentum to cause them to breath coldly. Then what about the king? The king was even more noble and awe-inspiring, causing ordinary people to feel amazed!</p><br/><p>The 3cm height difference didn\u2019t give Andrew an advantage. It actually made him seem a bit rude. The light highlighted his muscles but there was no effect. Like a foil, he made the youth at his side seem more exquisite and expensive.</p><br/><p>This feeling became more and more obvious after the beginning of the shoot!</p><br/><p>At first, the two men were standing side by side and looking at the lends. Later, the photographer arranged a chair and asked Ming Yu to sit in it, while Andrew held the back of the chair.</p><br/><p>On the black carved bench, the youth\u2019s causal movements seemed to attract everyone\u2019s attention. The handsome blond man behind him was completely reduced to the background. Sometimes people glanced over but he didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>The photographer was naturally also concerned about beauty. He didn\u2019t notice it but gradually, he was often putting the lens on Ming Yu and pressing the shutter. The photographer often asked Ming Yu and Andrew to pose together. However, in the end, it became like this\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cYes Ming Yu, raise your hands a bit more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful! Just a few more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Andrew was very proud when he just entered the set. He looked down at the Huaxia dwarf with contempt in his eyes. He hinted to the other side, \u2018Your head is very good, haha.\u2019</p><br/><p>In Andrew\u2019s heart, he grew up with his mother in the fashion industry. He was exposed to a variety of high-end shows and dinners. This broke model would definitely look like a poor hillbilly next to him!</p><br/><p>But!</p><br/><p>Andrew wasn\u2019t a fool. He gradually found that the protagonist of the lens was Ming Yu!</p><br/><p>Originally, it was a group photo with the two of them. Yet in these photos, he had stepped into the supporting role. In addition, the photographer occasionally had Ming Yu pose while Andrew stood by casually.</p><br/><p>Shit! This was simply disgusting!</p><br/><p>But Andrew couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>First of all, this was a master of photography who he couldn\u2019t offend. The other person was the top photography mater in the UK. His mother had several good cooperative relations with the master. In front of this master, Andrew had to hold back his arrogance.</p><br/><p>Second, Andrew had an arrogant desire to secretly suppress Ming Yu. The ending was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAndrew, you are slightly to the side and you are blocking Ming Yu\u2019s face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAndrew, your hand is in the middle of the photo. Move it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrews bizarre behavior caused the photographer to give a few suspicious commands. But once he saw Andrew steal the lens again and again, the photographer was furious and directly scolded, \u201cAndrew, what do you mean with this? Are you still a professional supermodel? Is this how you take photos?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Andrew was using his body to squeeze Ming Yu to one side, so that Ming Yu could only helplessly appear in a small corner of the lens. The youth had an innocent appearance while the bully Andrew was arbitrarily using brute force to bully him.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the master photographer, this behaviour was often called \u2018bullying between models\u2019 in the industry. It was common whenever shooting photos with two or more people. If the two models taking photos had a bad relationship, this event would occur more often.</p><br/><p>Models that could complement each other improved the photo. However, this didn\u2019t occur often. Usually the photo would only have one protagonist. The protagonist was often the one who bullied the other person. As for the other side, they would be bullied without any sense of existence.</p><br/><p>Prior to this, the photographer just felt that Ming Yu had a very good sense of the lens and an excellent temperament. He didn\u2019t think that Andrew would be three while taking photos! Destroying the photos again and again, it was maddening!</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Andrew was full of grievances. He immediately defended himself. \u201cMaster Oliver, it isn\u2019t my fault. When I first took photos with Ming Yu, I felt that he really couldn\u2019t take photos. I am trying to help him. This was the first step only for you to stop me. I was trying to help him find a suitable location.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft, haha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of the staffs laughed when they heard this. They stopped at Andrew\u2019s angry glare but only Luo Ru didn\u2019t hide her smile. She was still laughing silently.</p><br/><p>Do you know what it meant to make bogus accusations?</p><br/><p>Andrew was doing just that!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wasn\u2019t good at taking photos and needed help finding a position?</p><br/><p>Andrew unexpectedly said such shameless words?</p><br/><p>Who was the one suppressed by Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s aura and turned into a small supporting role in front of the camera? Wasn\u2019t this a really thick skin? It was so ridiculous that setting aside the laughing staff, even Master Oliver was stunned and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>After seeing no one refute him, Andrew panted like he was an unhealthy person climbing stairs!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Oliver, you have misunderstood me. I am helping him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thickness of his skin was unique even for the people on Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s life. Ming Xiaoyu inwardly laughed and laughed at Andrew who still wanted to speak. He was too lazy to care about this person and instead opened the door for Master Oliver. \u201cMaster, maybe we should take separate photos. If I am so bad at shooting then I\u2019m not a match for Mr. Andrei.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew immediately cried out, \u201cIt is Andrew!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu looked surprised and asked, \u201cIs is Andersu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is Andrew!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew was completely provoked by Ming Yu and shouted, \u201cDo you have ears? Picking faults. You are just a model from Huaxia. How long can you be arrogant? You will never enter the world\u2019s supermodel rankings. In front of me, you are just a small supporting role\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAndrew!\u201d Master Oliver couldn\u2019t listen anymore. \u201cApologize to Ming Yu! What type of attitude is this? You are used to being arrogant in the United States. Don\u2019t think that the whole fashion industry is about Karma. In London, you can\u2019t face my temper! Hurry and apologize!\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew had lived 17 years being spoiled by his family. When had he experienced being reprimanded in public? Even his parents never dared say no to him. This old man dared to scold him?</p><br/><p>Andrew scolded in his heard, \u2018You old fat. I gave you a little face but who do you think you are?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOliver, stop those words right now! I am Andrew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAndrew!\u201d</p><br/><p>The agent standing by never thought that anyone would dare offend Andrew. He didn\u2019t expect this scene to happen. He hurriedly interrupted Andrew\u2019s words and rushed forward. He grabbed Andrew and said, \u201cMaster Oliver, I\u2019m sorry. Andrew\u2019s mood is a bit bad today. I will take him to rest! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew wanted to say something more when he heard this. But his agent grimaced at him and begged him not to speak again. Therefore, Andrew grunted, looked at Ming Yu and Master Oliver before turning around.</p><br/><p>Master Oliver didn\u2019t want to have a bad relationship with Karma. After all, anyone in the industry knew how much the chief designer of Karma loved her son. A small model once collided with her son and she directly used the family to block him for 30 years. The model missed the best years of his life!</p><br/><p>Thus, Master Oliver grunted and accepted the apology. But he stressed, \u201cI don\u2019t care. Ming Yu should be the subject of your apology.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew was furious at the words and the agent hurriedly apologized to Ming Yu. Then he quickly pulled Andrew to the next room to put out the fire.</p><br/><p>This apology didn\u2019t contain any sincerity. Ming Yu stood there with lost eyes, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>His helpless appearance made all the employees feel sorry for him. However, they didn\u2019t dare offend Karma standing behind Andrew. They could only scold the rude man in their hearts while showing a kinder attitude to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru\u2019s mouth twitched as she silently watched this scene.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was poor and helpless?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu could only bow his head and endure the insults of the other person when being bullied?</p><br/><p>This was a joke!</p><br/><p>Xiaoyu was really bad. He just had to stand there with a lost expression and all the people were on his side! If this was acting in a movie, he might be able to get a small gold man!</p><br/><p>The day\u2019s photo shoot ended like this and Andrew was placed in another studio to avoid conflict. But as Ming Yu and Luo Ru came to the parking lot with Mr. Will, the three people heard an arrogant voice behind them. \u201cRunning away? Coming to the European and American fashion industries and playing such tricks on me. This Huaxia model is looking for death!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

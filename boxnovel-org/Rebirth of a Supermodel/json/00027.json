But at this time, Ming Yu was calmly searching the Internet in the Muse Building\u2019s lounge.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru sat on one side and carefully organized the information, sorting the invitations by type. Zhao Rui also smiled as he saw the statements on the Internet, with no signs of anger at all.</p><br/><p>A day passed and the sunspots were still tenacious. Zhao Rui just cried out, \u201cThe ability of the public relations department is really good! Shen Xiang, that kid\u2019s ability can\u2019t be underestimated. He is perfectly maintaining this topic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Were the actions of the sunspots really autonomous?</p><br/><p>Wrong!</p><br/><p>Indeed, these posts, it was basically the own remarks of the Weibo users. However, Muse\u2019s PR department involved themselves and helped the small number of sunspots survive.</p><br/><p>If Muse\u2019s powerful PR deparment hadn\u2019t lent their nuanced support, this topic would\u2019ve been submerged by things like \u2018Ming Xiaoyu is very adorable\u2019, \u2018I love God Xi\u2019 and \u2018Ming Xiaoyu is amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had been part of the industry for many years, so he wasn\u2019t a naive rookie. After the show was broadcasted yesterday, Shen Xiang, director of Muse\u2019s public relations department, looked for him and asked if he would agree to this method to help sustain the heated speculation.</p><br/><p>The small number of sunspots would keep Ming Yu\u2019s topic fresh, not allowing the topic to die down within three days.</p><br/><p>The fashion industry, the fashion industry, the waters of this industry were very deep.</p><br/><p>Apart from the few people standing at the peak, everyone was trying hard to climb to a higher status.</p><br/><p>The suggestion of Muse\u2019s PR department was actually considered a very clean method. They didn\u2019t hurt anyone and took the initiative to increase the visibility of their second-tier model, which any new models would dream about.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Rui was a little hesitant after hearing this. Luo Ru saw Zhao Rui\u2019s hesitation and couldn\u2019t help adding, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Brother Zhao. Ming Yu\u2019s reputation won\u2019t receive any damage. Most people still don\u2019t know who Ming Yu is, so we have to use this to push him forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang smiled as he heard this and turned towards Luo Ru, who gently nodded at him.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu glanced at the two people before walking direction in front of Zhao Rui. \u201cBrother Zhao, I agree with this proposal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui looked at Ming Yu with a startled expression and eventually nodded.</p><br/><p>In fact, in Zhao Rui\u2019s heart, he was hoping that Ming Yu could smoothly climb up. Don\u2019t cause any big issues, continue to prove himself with his own strength and gain gans.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Rui didn\u2019t wonder why they could get these resources?</p><br/><p>If a magazine offered Ming Yu a job, there was nothing to say. It must be due to his reputation. Then if Muse gave resources to Ming Yu, it must also be due to his ability!</p><br/><p>Just as no pies would fall from the sky, these small sunspots would\u2019ve been drowned out a long time ago by the general public.</p><br/><p>Everything steadily developed under Muse\u2019s PR department\u2019s prediction. After two or three days passed, they voluntarily ceased their support to these sunspots, letting them disappear naturally. By then, Ming Yu would\u2019ve gained a high profile and added a lot of fans.</p><br/><p>But at this time, things started to develop beyond Muse\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>Muse just wanted to maintain the topic in order to keep Ming Yu in the public eye. However, as more and more of Ming Yu\u2019s fans supported their idol, their power couldn\u2019t be controlled by others!</p><br/><p>Many of Xi Ze\u2019s fans became fans of Ming Yu and started to speak up for him.</p><br/><p>This mighty army directly allowed Ming Yu\u2019s Weibo to reach 1.5 million fans, an increase of more than 400,000 fans in two days!</p><br/><p>But the more frightening thing was the increase in the number of fans on the Muse website!</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang\u2019s people carefully checked the system and there weren\u2019t any problems. It was hard to believe, but Ming Yu\u2019s fans on the official website increased by 100,000 in two days, for a total of 270,000!</p><br/><p>For a time, all the forums and microblogs were discussing this matter, making the support for Ming Yu louder and louder. This momentum exceeded Muse\u2019s official expectations! In the case of the search terms rankings list, #Xi Ze# quickly climbed to first place. But the second place was #Ming Yu\u2019s smile#. Even the sixth place was just #Ming Yu#!</p><br/><p>So far, Muse\u2019s PR department got a big fruit and intended to close the topic, letting things develop naturally. But perhaps because it was brought to the light, but these wild sunspots wanted to counterattack to the end.</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to laugh and cry. It is obvious that he bought fans, this method is really low. \u3011 \u3010 Really low\uff0b1 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Buying fans, buying the navy, is the public relations person someone who just graduated from university? \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The sunspots wanted to struggle, but how could Ming Yu\u2019s fans and passersby turn a blind eye?</p><br/><p>\u3010 Why are sunspots such jerks? Who bought a navy? My fan certificate will fall on deaf eyes, so I will just curse you. This rookie confessing to the god, who would be provoked? Horizontal scrolling message: I won\u2019t accept it! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Hahahaha, Master Po is so talented! I don\u2019t understand where so many sunspots came from.\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Master Po is really great! Criticizing Ming Xiaoyu for buying a navy. If Ming Xiaoyu really bought a navy, I will do a live broadcast where I eat shit! \u3011 (The literal translation is \u2018eat xiang.\u2019 I found an explanation on urbandictionary, but don\u2019t know if it is reliable or not)</p><br/><p>\u3010 I firmly believe that Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s strength is real, but I suddenly want to see the person eat shit. \uff3f\uff08\uff1a\u0437\u300d\u2220\uff09\uff3f \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to see them eating shit +1. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to see them eating shit +2. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u3010 (\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b Don\u2019t eat shit! These group of people, you aren\u2019t good!!! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>These voices continued to appear, causing the topic to be carried away by the fans. They watched the sunspots come forward then surrounded them as a group, ridiculing them.</p><br/><p>This made the powerless sunspots angry and jittery. It ended up raising the heat on the topic again, causing a slight impact. However, these soft attacks completely lost their power from something posted on a microblog.</p><br/><p>Do you think it was Xi Ze\u2019s microblog?</p><br/><p>No, no, yes\uff5e</p><br/><p>[The real Sir Wu: Remember the words you secretly said to me after recording that problem [/Cover face] [/Cover face]. Next week, should we go out to eat barbecue? @Ming Yu \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s fans: !!!!!</p><br/><p>What words?!!!</p><br/><p>What did he say?!!!</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Ming CP\u2019 fans: Our pairing seems to be around the corner!!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was startled when Zhao Rui that Wu Yuzhen had suddenly inserted himself into the battle of fans, making more people ignore the sunspots, turning their gazes to the pink bubbles around Wu Yuzhen and Ming Yu instead.</p><br/><p>He thought about it and understood that Wu Yuzhen was really trying to help.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Ming Yu quickly wrote a reply on Weibo.</p><br/><p> \u3010 Good, we will go eat barbecue [/Smile] \u3011</p><br/><p> Then he opened his phone and sent Wu Yuzhen a text message: [Sir Wu, thank you for helping me. I will invite you to dinner next well.]</p><br/><p> After a moment, Wu Yuzhen replied: [I can\u2019t wait for your meal.] He was a decent gentleman, so Ming Yu didn\u2019t mind making further contact with him.</p><br/><p>At this point, the situation on the Internet had developed in the direction of the \u2018Wu Ming CP.\u2019 There were even some media outlets who released an article about Ming Yu that was officially arranged by Muse.</p><br/><p>Things on the Internet were great and Ming Yu was benefiting.</p><br/><p>Looking at the number of Ming Yu\u2019s fans that kept on rising, Zhao Rui sighed and concluded. \u201cI\u2019m still not good enough. I couldn\u2019t grasp the situation like Shen Xiang or make a decisive decision. Ming Yu, it is fortunate that you resolutely accepted Shen Xiang\u2019s proposal. Otherwise, I don\u2019t know if the current situation would\u2019ve happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Ming Yu first looked at Luo Ru and the two people exchanged a smile. Then he turned to look at Zhao Rui and added to the first. \u201cBrother Zhao, you are a bit indecisive but it isn\u2019t a drawback. I believe that you will make great progress in the future. But\u2026 it requires you to work harder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s tone was mild, not harsh when he was saying this. But Zhao Rui thoroughly engraved it in his heart.</p><br/><p>It was true that Zhao Rui had always been good to him, Ming Yu clearly knew this. However, Zhao Rui really needed to grow up. Ming Yu didn\u2019t know why Zhao Rui was favoured by a number of senior Muse staff, such as Shen Xiang, but only someone with actual strength could move forward.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui nodded heavily at Ming Yu\u2019s words and started to reflect.</p><br/><p>On the other side, something happened that no one expected!</p><br/><p>Just as the \u2018Wu Ming CP\u2019 topic was becoming hotter and noisier, a microblog that hadn\u2019t updated in two months suddenly posted a new message\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xi Ze: I will be waiting for you @ Ming Yu \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2211\uff08\u3063 \u00b0\u0414 \u00b0\uff1b\uff09\u3063!!!!!!</p><br/><p>What\u2014what\u2014ghost!!!</p><br/><p>\u3010 God Xi was hacked, God Xi wasn\u2019t hacked, I think that God Xi was hacked! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 What wait what wait! God Xi is waiting for Ming Xiaoyu to overcome him? Ahhhhhh! I\u2019m looking at you, I also said that I want to go beyond you, ahhhhhhh! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 God Xi cares about Xiaoyu, he isn\u2019t looking at you! God Xi cares about Xiaoyu!!! Ahhh, I\u2019m so excited that I ran three laps downstairs! \u3011</p><br/><p>The \u2018Wu Ming CP\u2019 that was just heating up?</p><br/><p>Eh? What was that?</p><br/><p>God Xi was better than him!</p><br/><p>God Xi\u2019s Weibo message, who cared about the \u2018Wu Ming CP?\u2019</p><br/><p>How many people could make God Xi specifically microblog about them? Find and show me!</p><br/><p>A fan said that God Xi and Ming Xiaoyu were both Muse models, so maybe it was just the older generation taking care of the newcomer?</p><br/><p>But when someone found that Xi Ze even followed Ming Yu\u2019s official website, everyone was stunned\u2014</p><br/><p>Such concern, it didn\u2019t couldn\u2019t be explained by advising a newcomer!</p><br/><p>God Xi, come out quickly and said that your Weibo and Muse accounts have been stolen ahhhhh!!!!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the sun slowly slid to the west, creating magnificent rose red clouds in the sky across Beijing. In the towering Muse building, a man angrily rode the elevator to the top. He kicked open the door and his opening sentence\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Ze!! What type of medicine are you eating? Do you know the impact of your words?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

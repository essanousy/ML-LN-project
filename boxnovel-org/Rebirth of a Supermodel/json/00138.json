The so called \u2018bad times\u2019 was appropriate to describe his last year.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu was relatively satisfied in the beginning after seizing Cheng Su from Zhao Rui\u2019s hands. Cheng Su had some strength. Apart from the matter of Zhao Rui, he could surely train Cheng Su into a good supermodel.</p><br/><p>But the situation changed dramatically a year ago.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was tall and handsome. He truly had the seed to be a supermodel seedling. It was difficult if he wanted to move one step further onto the world\u2019s supermodel list. But this wasn\u2019t what made Zeng Shu concerned. It seemed that Cheng Su was a bit stubborn.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu had already advised Cheng Su not to associate with Zhao Rui\u2019s people. Yet Cheng Su always committed another crime. He even tried to press on Ming Yu during the reality show filming.</p><br/><p>This guy did something selfish in order to hurt another person, only for them to not be harmed. Cheng Su himself was the one who received big damage. It really made Zeng Shu lose some hair.</p><br/><p>After that, Zeng Shu sternly warned Cheng Su away from Ming Yu. Ming Yu\u2019s potential was much higher than Cheng Su\u2019s and he also had a background that no one could afford to go against. If Cheng Su saw him later, take a detour and don\u2019t openly find any trouble.</p><br/><p>But\u2026dammit! That Cheng Su bastard wasn\u2019t obedient!</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu hadn\u2019t known that Cheng Su and his assistant privately contacted a navy in order to engage in marketing activities. At the time, he was across the ocean with another supermodel under him, talking about a fashion show. It wasn\u2019t until the assistant felt things couldn\u2019t be concealed anymore that Zeng Shu learned about the stupid thing Cheng Su had done.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu immediately called Cheng Su and scolded, \u201cHow many times have I told you? How many times have I told you? Cheng Su, were you listening? You shouldn\u2019t mess with Ming Yu or get involved with him! He is untouchable! Do you hear me? Do you want me to write a note and shove it in your mouth so that you can remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was silent as he was scolded for a while. Finally, he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cBut Brother Zhao, this really isn\u2019t my doing. My fans couldn\u2019t stand that I was being bullied by Ming Yu. You also said that the person behind him is untouchable, but he is just using his background to suppress me. I\u2019m really not convinced\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of the night in the United Stats, Zeng Shu\u2019s anger reached its peak as he finally askd in a funny manner, \u201cCheng Su, how many times do I have to say it? In this year, Ming Yu\u2019s results are much better than yours. This year, he was 100 times better! It is right that he holds you down while he is being pressured by Andrew. It is Andrew who went in through the back door!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s fingers clenched with indignation as he heard this. Zeng Shu continued to speak. \u201cSince you have done this, Ming Yu and Zhao Rui would\u2019ve already discovered it. Things are irreversible. Fortunately, you haven\u2019t taken any improper measures this time so the company won\u2019t do anything to you. You have to immediately stop everything and hand it over to me. After all, you are my model. I will try to help you but you must give me something in return. Before you do anything in the future, be sure to tell me first. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su refused to answer.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu sighed. \u201cIn this industry, there are too many models who are more powerful than you. You can\u2019t waste energy on being jealous. Forget about Ming Yu. I know that there were a few incidents between you previously but you should be glad he hasn\u2019t done anything to you. Why are you always in a rush to provoke him? Concentrate on your own business. Next month\u2019s rankings might have your name on it. If you keep acting like this, I don\u2019t have to say that the person behind Ming Yu won\u2019t give you any good food to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before hanging up the phone, Cheng Su couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cBrother Zeng, who is behind Ming Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu was slightly started for a moment. Finally, he thought, \u2018Perhaps I should tell him. This will make him completely forget about Ming Yu and he won\u2019t fight with others.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then Zeng Shu spoke solemnly, \u201cBehind Ming Yu is Xi Ze.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, after Luo Ru started to act, Cheng Su\u2019s marketing method began to gradually change. Zeng Shu was afraid of Xi Ze but it was impossible to disregard the interest of his own model. Therefore, he arranged for a draft of the \u2018Cheng Su will participate in the Jiayi fashion show\u2019 to be published.</p><br/><p>The fans no longer had the strength to debate about whether Ming Yu should be before Cheng Su. Once this article was published, they instantly gained confidence and no longer focused on the small problem of rankings.</p><br/><p>\u301023333 Ah Cheng could actually become Jiayu\u2019s finale model! This is strength! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 wasn\u2019t Guo Yang the finale model for Jiayi\u2019s autumn and winter show? Guo Yang is 56th on the list of male models. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ah Cheng is really amazing! He is really handsome! He will surely fly! Ah Cheng might be temporarily under pressure but don\u2019t feel discouraged. Some people\u2019s achievements aren\u2019t as good as yours and I don\u2019t understand why they are before you. I believe that when the next supermodel\u2019s list comes out, you will use your strength to hit him in the face! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu naturally didn\u2019t pay attention to fans comments. He used a small navy to hype up Cheng Su participating in the Jiayi fashion show rather than paying attention to the supermodels list.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu originally planned to announce the Jiayi fashion show next week. Combined with other methods of publicity, Cheng Su\u2019s popularity would surge. But this time, he used it hastily in order to divert the fans\u2019 attention. It wasted a good gimmick.</p><br/><p>In Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s lounge, Zhao Rui was very angry when he saw this. He said bluntly, \u201cThis style is Zeng Shu\u2019s handwriting! I\u2019m sure of it! It is definitely him, not Cheng Su! Xiaoyu, he wants to hit us in the face so he brought up the Jiayi finale model.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu pondered for a long time before shaking his head. \u201cBrother Zhao, you are wrong. No matter who sent out this notice, it isn\u2019t to provoke us. It is actually asking us for mercy. He doesn\u2019t want to get entangled with us on the issue of the supermodels list and actively avoided the topic. In fact, he is surrendering.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was stuck on one word. \u201cSurrendering? Zeng Shu wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled., \u201cThere is nothing in the world that will never be done. It is just that the reason for doing it hasn\u2019t been encountered yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui understood that this time, Zeng Shu was unexpectedly begging for mercy. He was in a good mood as he suggested, \u201cMing Yu, we should chase after the victory. Once they taste the bitter fruit, they won\u2019t come provoke us again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thought about it before shaking his head. \u201cBrother, there is a word called \u2018desperation.\u2019 Everyone has their limits. If we push too tightly then I\u2019m afraid Zeng Shu wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it anymore. Thus, both of us should step down now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Zhao Rui and Luo Ru were shocked by Ming Yu\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Was Ming Xiaoyu such a thoughtful and kind person?</p><br/><p>The next day, Ming Yu had Luo Ru published a notice:</p><br/><p>[Fei Sixin\u2019s first fashion show has invited Ming Yu to be the finale model, leading the trends!] The supermodels list would eventually pass because it was just a list. There were 370 people on the list but only a few could claim to be the best in the fashion industry.</p><br/><p>Before September arrived, Ming Xiaoyu already picked Fei Sixin\u2019s show. At the same time, Cheng Su didn\u2019t lag behind and became the finale model for Jiayi.</p><br/><p>For a time, Huaxia\u2019s two new supermodels were confrontational.</p><br/><p>As early as three days ago, Xi Ze was invited by a top luxury brand and flew to the United States to participate in the event. It was the next night when he learned about what happened.</p><br/><p>On the phone, a low and magnetic voice was heard, like a mellow cello. \u201cThis is your first show after becoming a supermodel. You should choose a top-tier one. Your last fashion show was for Nidelan and now you are participating in Fei Sixin\u2019s show. It is a bit risky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t talk about Cheng Su, as if he really didn\u2019t know anything. He just analyzed Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s choice.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had just been returning home when he heard this. He wore his slippers at the entrance and laughed. \u201cXi Ze, what type of fashion show do you think I should choose after becoming a supermodel?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man over the telephone thought for a moment. Then Xi Ze sighed and said, \u201cI am wrong. I will give you a special place in Ji and Ya\u2019s fashion show next month.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s tone was filled with such regret that Ming Xiaoyu sneered. He didn\u2019t say anything, just listening as Xi Ze continued, \u201cI have made such a big concession. Shouldn\u2019t I be rewarded when I return?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu gave a low hum. \u201cYou want a reward?\u201d He acted like he was thinking. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know that the next Ji and Ya fashion show is for female clothing? But I am kind-hearted, I will forgive you., After you come back from the United States, we will play the three months delayed \u2018fierce and nagging daughter\u2019 and \u2018overbearing male\u2019 scene\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu immediately clapped. \u201cGood! It is happily decided! When you come back from the United States, it is my turn to sing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One was the first show of a super newcomer designer\u2019s debut brand.</p><br/><p>The other was a fashion show for a first-tier brand in Huaxia.</p><br/><p>Perhaps in the eyes of many people, the latter held more weight than the former. But was this really the case?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

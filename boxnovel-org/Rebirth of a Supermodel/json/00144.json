It would be both fun and satisfying.</p><br/><p>The process this time was quite different from what he imagined but it also had a unique feeling. It was as if there were many small ants gently biting at his heart lightly, making him unable to extricate himself. It was too easy to be provoked by this man.</p><br/><p>However, there are some things that must be made clear.</p><br/><p>For example\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI am on top this time Mr Xi. You can\u2019t go back on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Principles were broken so easily. You see, Ming Xiaoyu always stressed that \u201cI am the bully, you are the good girl.\u201d However, once Mr. Xi preempted the role, Ming Xiaoyu unexpected acquiesced. A tacit agreement! He acquiesced!</p><br/><p>After all, it was quite a feeling\uff5e</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s deep and quiet eyes flashed in the dim light. His lips curved and he started to grumble. \u201cA month ago, at the An Li wrap up, you used your hand and touched Xiao Biqing\u2019s forehead. Three days ago, after the Sixin fashion show, you let Fei Sixin hold you for three minutes, Today, you and Luo Cheng sneaked around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! I was just talking to Luo Cheng about the RAmer Charity Gala! That little boy, what could I possibly do with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, Ming Xiaoyu just looked on disdainfully as this shameless man used an old trick to avoid the problem. However, Ming Yu wasn\u2019t convinced when Xi Ze spoke about Luo Cheng!</p><br/><p>For what reason? Weren\u2019t he and Luo Cheng both receivers? What was going to happen?</p><br/><p>\u2014This was Ming Yu\u2019s unconscious explanation. He didn\u2019t realize that he had already positioned himself as the shou \uff3f\uff08\uff1a\u0437\u300d\u2220\uff09\uff3f</p><br/><p>Xi Ze naturally found this loophole that Ming Yu didn\u2019t notice. Therefore, he laughed loudly before frowning. \u201cYou have done many things that make me sad but if you must be one top, it isn\u2019t impossible. However\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold and elegant face reveals a faint smile. Xi Ze\u2019s lips curved as he said, \u201cWhile you were filming, I made you a special outfit. If you are willing to wear it for me\u2026\u201d Xi Ze pretended to make a \u2018pressing one\u2019s luck\u2019 expression. \u201cAs long as you wear it, I will let bygones be bygones. You will be on top tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoyu was surprised and immediately found a trace of something wrong. \u201cYou really just want me to wear an outfit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wearing an outfit was nothing!</p><br/><p>A beautiful outfit, don\u2019t just ask him to wear it. If it was really beautiful, he would be willing to spend a lot of money to buy it. Look at the suit designed by Sixin. Ming Yu spent almost 100,000 buying it and this was half the price.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze solemnly nodded. \u201cYes, as long as you wear this outfit.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said so but once Ming Xiaoyu saw the outfit, his face darkened. He said nothing and turned away. He had just taken a step when the man suddenly grabbed his wrist and pulled the youth into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to put it on for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s face was covered with dark lines. Ming Yu asked, \u201cYou want me to wear women\u2019s clothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s voice was full of violent criticism but Xi Ze nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t wait for Ming Yu to criticize him. He spoke with great seriousness, \u201cAs a good supermodel, you should try many different styles. He Chaoman has shot a set of men\u2019s photos that will be released soon. Adriennes Clark has even walked in high end women\u2019s fashion shows and won the applause of the audience. If you want to get everyone\u2019s approval, you have to go out of your own way to control every style and truly become a qualified supermodel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s words were very solemn and reasonable. However, Ming Xiaoyu chuckled and asked him, \u201cMr. Xi, why don\u2019t you try wearing the dress? You are the world\u2019s top supermodel. You should set an example!\u201d</p><br/><p>If this was someone else, they would\u2019ve lost and could only retreat. Unfortunately, Ming Xiaoyu was facing Xi Ze!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze sighed without hesitation and said with great regret, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not officially retired, I haven\u2019t walked in any show for a year. I\u2019m not a qualified model.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026I really want to hit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming XIaoyu sneered. \u201cI will hit you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he spoke, the youth punched Xi Ze in the chest. He couldn\u2019t hit the face. If this face was ruined, Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t cry even if he wanted to. Xi Ze enjoyed the youth\u2019s light fists and asked, \u201cWill you wear it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu snorted and didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze earnestly nodded. \u201cThen I will help you change your clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I haven\u2019t agreed yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze laughed. \u201cI know, you have agreed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tone was calm without a trace of hesitation. Ming Xiaoyu stared at this man\u2019s handsome face for a long time before finally sighing deeply. \u201cI am really caught in your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze leaned down to take off the youth\u2019s boots and whispered softly, \u201cBut I am also caught in your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t suppress his voice, allowing Ming Yu to hear it. This made the youth\u2019s original aggrieved mood feel a lot better. Next, Xi Ze carefully took off Ming Yu\u2019s clothes and helped him wear this complex and cumbersome outfit.</p><br/><p>The designer moved flexibly around the youth.</p><br/><p>In five minutes, a tall and unrecognizable beauty appeared in the spacious and quiet cloakroom.</p><br/><p>Under the bright and dazzling lights, the silver-white dress sparkled in the crystal-clear light. The silver silk buried in each line by the needle was like a gemstone, making this dress as dazzling as the galazy.</p><br/><p>The clothes were beautiful and the person who wore them was even better.</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s waist was slender and the lines were smooth and beautiful. The skirt fell down from his waist in a beatiful arc. The skirt opened at a slit from the thigh and a long graceful leg was revealed.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any of the strong muscles of a Western male supermodel. Ming Yu\u2019s legs were long and tender, the muscles laying quietly under the delicate skin. It shone like white jade. Against the backdrop of a long strip of reddish gems at the split ends, it looked even more red and glamourous, white ad clear.</p><br/><p>Once he saw this dress, Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help sighing.</p><br/><p>He knew this dress. It was the long dress that He Chaoman wore as the finale in Ji and Ya\u2019s last high-end fashion show. Knowing it was beautiful was one thing. It was another thing to see it after wearing it.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s thin fingers wandered between the youth\u2019s long hair. His hair wasn\u2019t as short was it was a few months ago, but it wasn\u2019t long enough. However, Xi Ze had a special way of taking care of it that added a dazzling beauty.</p><br/><p>The young man stared at himself in the mirror that spanned the whole wall and couldn\u2019t regain himself for a long time.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze also looked at the youth in the long dress. He was so beautiful that gender could be ignored. Xi Ze\u2019s hot eyes lingered on the high collarbone, the fragile bones and the beautiful curve of the waist. Finally, his hand couldn\u2019t help touching the youth\u2019s waist from the rear.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze whispered, \u201cOnly you can wear it so beautifully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at his strange and beautiful self in the mirror and smiled helplessly. \u201cYour little aunt would be very angry if she heard this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze gently shook his head. \u201cShe also knows that she can never wear this dress better than you. It is because I made this dress for you. Like the high-cut suit, they go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze paused for a moment after saying this and sighed with great regret. \u201cIf only you still have silver hair, you would be even more beautiful than you are now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he beautiful now? No, he was already beautiful.</p><br/><p>In Xi Ze\u2019s heart, his muse was the most beautiful person in the world. No matter hor narcissistic he was, he felt that he was far less than this youth.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s height wasn\u2019t short but he didn\u2019t look tall standing in front of Xi Ze. Thus, wearing this beautiful long dress, he looked more feminine.</p><br/><p>Of course, this type of beauty wasn\u2019t purely feminine. There was a type of strong and unique male beauty that couldn\u2019t be ignored. It was mixed with the soft beauty to form a unique and charming neutral style.</p><br/><p>A ray of light shone in the youth\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>He leaned back in the man\u2019s arms, enjoying the hot temperature.</p><br/><p>In the mirror, they looked like a couple. The black suit and white shirt lined up without any abrupt places, a natural harmony.</p><br/><p>The long skirt with the naked back meant the youth\u2019s thin and white back directly touched the man\u2019s chest. The two people\u2019s heartbearts became rapid from this simple embrace and it gradually became no longer simple.</p><br/><p>Finally, Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help half turning around, gently kissing the man\u2019s lips. Then the kiss went out of control.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Despite their attempts, he kept insisting, \u201cBrother Yuan, I think I should speak on this matter. Ming Yu is a newcomer, he probably hasn\u2019t been trained in acting before. Once he was put in a group with Old Lu, what should Old Lu do?\u201d</p><br/><p>A\u2019Zhao looked at the pale face of Lu Zhenxi and asked, \u201cOld Lu, tell us. Weren\u2019t you just playing on the phone instead of rehearsing? I wanted to ask you about it, but Ming Yu\u2019s peaceful manner stopped me. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi\u2019s expression changed dramatically at A\u2019Zhao\u2019s words. Brother Yuan also looked at Lu Zhenxi in a thoughtful manner, finally understanding the situation.</p><br/><p>At this point, Ming Yu was frowning slightly but didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t agree with A\u2019Zhao to defend himself, nor did he act like a white lotus and speak up for Lu Zhenxi. He just stood there with his head bowed.</p><br/><p>However, this appearance just solidified Brother Yuan\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan sighed softly and scolded, \u201cLu Zhenxi, you aren\u2019t a child. Why couldn\u2019t you work together? You were able to enter my class, so playing on the phone during rehearsal time is really wrong. I am in charge so tonight, please invited Ming Yu and everyone else to a meal to apologize. Then I will let this matter pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan\u2019s suggestion wasn\u2019t unpleasant.</p><br/><p>After all, everyone was part of the same company. Lu Zhenxi wasn\u2019t really sociable or have a good relationship with A\u2019Zhao, but he was already a debuted model.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Lu Zhenxi wasn\u2019t stupid. He didn\u2019t expect A\u2019Zhao to help the \u2018outsider\u2019 and expose his shortcomings, and he was suddenly at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi had already debuted and his agent was Zeng Shu, so his conditions were good. However, everyone knew that Zeng Shu was in charge of two supermodels and several popular first-tier models. Lu Zhenxi was a small and unknown model and hadn\u2019t seen Zeng Shu for almost half a month. His assistant mostly managed him.</p><br/><p>All in all, Lu Zhenxi\u2019s position in the company wasn\u2019t really good. His agent being hostile to Ming Yu\u2019s agent was the only reason why he dared offend Ming Yu so recklessly.</p><br/><p>And in his heart, he thought that Zeng Shu was much more amazing than Zhao Rui. Ming Yu might be in the limelight recently, but Cheng Su was still far ahead.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi showed some disdain as he thought this. Finally, he cleared his expression and bowed to Ming Yu. \u201cSorry Ming Yu, I shouldn\u2019t have played with my phone during the rehearsal. I don\u2019t want to be at odds with you, so I will invite you to dinner tonight as an apology.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were perfect, but his tone wasn\u2019t very sincere, causing Brother Yuan to frown.</p><br/><p>But Ming Yu just smiled and shook his head. \u201cThere is no need for dinner. I understand you heart and it isn\u2019t a big deal. After all, we will be classmates.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s voice was pleasant and gently, reminding them of a spring breeze. Brother Yuan couldn\u2019t help thinking in his heart, \u2018Look! Ming Yu is dignified and not arrogant. He doesn\u2019t let the pressure get to his heart! Lu Zhenxi, you really have a lot to learn!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026Well, if he was a villain, Ming Yu would be a black-hearted sesame bag.</p><br/><p>Look at this gentle expression, this wall of calmness!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t say anything, letting the upright A\u2019Zhao reveal the truth. This allowed Ming Xiaoyu to control their hearts.</p><br/><p>But for A\u2019Zhao, Ming Yu had different thoughts. Once no one was paying attention, he carefully watched the other person and had some ideas.</p><br/><p>If it was someone else\u2019s business, Ming YU wouldn\u2019t help. But one of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s rules of life was to already repay gratitude.</p><br/><p>A\u2019Zhao helped him without asking anything in return. Such people weren\u2019t common in this industry, so he should really do something for the other person.</p><br/><p>The matter was temporarily over. Lu Zhenxi still found it difficult to smile, but the others were laughing again.</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan started to give advice on the shortcomings of the five people. Old Chen and A\u2019Zhao wanted to get away, but Brother Yuan dealt quick blows.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a lot of content in the afternoon class and Lu Zhenxi invited everyone to eat. Therefore, Brother Yuan made a suggestion. They would end the class ahead of schedule and go out to eat together. This could be considered a welcoming party for Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>While tidying up the books on the table, A\u2019Xue smiled and said, \u201cThank you so much, Ming Xiaoyu. Old Lu is so stingy! Wanting him to treat us? The degree of difficulty is too high! If it wasn\u2019t for you, I really don\u2019t know when we could eat a meal bought by Old Lu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu just gently shook his head. \u201cLu Zhenxi is too polite. In fact, it isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Chen interrupted from where he was listening on the side, \u201cDon\u2019t say that! Anyway, it really is rare for Old Lu to buy us a meal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, everyone was chatting again. A\u2019Xue and Old Chen joked about Lu Zhenxi, while the latter was acting strangely. Ming Yu had just arrived and didn\u2019t bring anything with him, so he waited outside the door for everyone to pack up.</p><br/><p>The slowest A\u2019Xue was still packing her things when there was a sharp \u2018click\u2019 sound from beside Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu turned with a startled expression, seeing a gently man standing in the doorway.</p><br/><p>The pair stared at each other for a moment, before Ming Yu nodded lightly. The other person glanced at him a few more times with a thoughtful expression. Ming Yu was trying to figure out who this was when Lu Zhenxi let out a strange sound of surprise, \u201cBrother Zeng! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was suddenly enlightened and looked at this handsome and elegant man.</p><br/><p>\u2014So this was Zeng Shu?</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu didn\u2019t pay attention to Ming Yu\u2019s look as he walked to Lu Zhenxi, laughing lightly. \u201cAh, there is a trip you need to go on tomorrow, so I came to find you.\u201d Zeng Shu paused before asking, \u201cI just heard, you need to treat them to a meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>A bright light flashed in Lu Zhenxi\u2019s eyes at the words.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He guessed what was going to happen next\u2014</p><br/><p>Tell the parents!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. For 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, the time-tested trick in a children\u2019s quarrel was</p><br/><p>Tell the parents!</p><br/><p>Oh, there was another terrible trick: Tell the teacher.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi was smart. He didn\u2019t exaggerate or lie. He just told Zeng Shu why he had to treat them to dinner. Once learning that it was due to Ming Yu, Zeng Shu looked slightly surprised and turned to glance at the boy standing in front of the door.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu had recognized Ming Yu at first glance.</p><br/><p>Forget about how fast this youth\u2019s popularity was growing in recent months. By virtue of his agent being \u2018Zhao Rui,\u2019 Zhen Shu already had all of Ming Yu\u2019s details firmly in his mind. He even knew the result of the revised physical test this morning.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu didn\u2019t like Zhao Rui.</p><br/><p>This was known to many people in Muse.</p><br/><p>The two men had a very bad relationship since entering the company. Zeng Shu was powerful and used his skills to become Muse\u2019s first-tier agent. The latter didn\u2019t have a lot of skills, but he had the solid backing of chief stylist Zhou Wei Zhuo, allowing him to meet a lot of senior Muse members.</p><br/><p>There was also a small incident. In fact, when Ming Yu was first discovered by Muse scouts, Zeng Shu and Zhao Rui fought to get him. Finally, Zhao Rui became Ming Yu\u2019s agent, so these two people were still fresh in Zeng Shu\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Now that he knew his model was in a predicament because of Ming Yu, Zeng Shu couldn\u2019t help taking a more serious look at Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>However, Zeng Shu was Zeng Shu. He didn\u2019t speak for Lu Zhenxi, reprimanding him instead. \u201cDon\u2019t do something stupid and practice well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi nodded at the words.</p><br/><p>But Lu Zhenxi was surprised by the next words. Zeng Shu smiled and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a big deal. It is just a trivial matter. I will pay for tonight\u2019s dinner. However, Lu Zhenxi can\u2019t attend the dinner. After all, we have a trip tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan, A\u2019Zhao and the others weren\u2019t aware of anything unusual and agreed to Zeng Shu\u2019s proposal. But Ming Yu\u2019s lips dropped slightly and he quietly watched Zeng Shu.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu had done two things. First, he paid for Lu Zhenxi. Second, he took Lu Zhenxi away from the dinner.</p><br/><p>By doing these two things, he was acknowledging Lu Zhenzi\u2019s mistake but not giving any responsibility to him. He seemed to be saying: \u2018You might think he is wrong, but he won\u2019t get any punishment.\u2019 Accepting this proposal was a small psychological victory.</p><br/><p>The two people stared at each other for a moment. Then Ming Yu sighed and nodded, \u201cOkay, Brother Zeng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu couldn\u2019t help revealing a cold smile. He turned to Lu Zhenxi and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d before walking with Lu Zhenxi to the door.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu stood silently in front of the door, watching the two people come closer.</p><br/><p>Once Zeng Shu and Lu Zhenxi were less than a metre away, Ming Yu planned to step aside and let the two men open the door. However, he had just lifted his feet when he suddenly felt his left hand being pulled!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu raised surprised eyes to the door, falling into a pair of deep eyes. Somehow, his heart became quiet. The stuffy and helpless feeling from being forced to compromised completely disappeared!</p><br/><p>The beautiful youth gently smiled as he looked at his friend standing outside.</p><br/><p>Then that handsome and elegant man pushed open the door in an indifferent manner. Once the door was pushed open, the long shadow of the man suddenly appeared in the training room.</p><br/><p>As a result, a powerful and oppressive aura spread instantly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

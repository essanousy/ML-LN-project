Everyone was facing the north-south direction, with Brother Yuan, A\u2019Zhao and the other two seated under the stage.</p><br/><p>This stage was actually only a slightly elevated platform. Ming Yu was sitting in a chair in a relaxed manner, while Lu Zhenxi sat opposite him.</p><br/><p>At this point, both students were fully prepared.</p><br/><p>A dazzling white light shone on the youth\u2019s delicate face, making him look more outstanding. Brother Yuan saw this and was actually looking forward to it. He was full of expectations towards what this youth could show!</p><br/><p>So, in a rare manner for him, Brother Yuan stood up and said personally, \u201cMing Yu is playing the actress, it seems like his skills are very high. Both of you are already debuted models, but you have to cooperate well. Okay, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Brother Yuan stopped speaking, Lu Zhenxi started to act. He smiled tenderly towards Ming Yu and lovingly said, \u201cMy dear, this restaurant\u2019s steak is very good. You like to eat steak, so I will let you try their classic steak.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Lu Zhenxi raised his hand like he was calling a waiter.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi\u2019s acting was considered normal in this class. From the original four students, A\u2019Zhao and A\u2019Xue acted very well, causing Brother Yuan to feel appreciation. Meanwhile Old Chen and Lu Zhenxi were only so-so.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi performed this section with no difficult, making Brother Yuan nod with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Then Brother Yuan, A\u2019Zhao, A\u2019Xue and Old Chen looked at Ming Yu. They were wondering what type of surprise this boy could show them!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ming Yu calmly looked at Lu Zhenxi and his lips gently curved, revealing a bright smile.</p><br/><p>For a moment, Brother Yuan and the others were shocked.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s good looks could be counted among the best of the whole fashion industry. Now that he was smiling, he was like a brilliant spring flower. Don\u2019t even talk about the female role. Brother Yuan would believe it if Ming Yu was actually a female!</p><br/><p>The smiling teenager asked in a curious manner, \u201cSteak? You want to eat steak?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A\u2019Zhao, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A\u2019Xue, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Chen, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The nearest, most damaged Lu Zhenxi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s smile and the way he said his lines weren\u2019t the problem. They just felt like this boy wasn\u2019t looking at his lover!</p><br/><p>Even if the lover betrayed him and he knew it, this wasn\u2019t right!</p><br/><p>It felt like\u2026</p><br/><p>He was looking at a hot dish! Delicious sweet and sour!</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi was still acting, so he was only sluggish for a few moments before hurriedly saying, \u201cYes Dear, don\u2019t you want to eat beef\u2026the\u2026amount\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi\u2019s words slowly trailed off at Ming Yu\u2019s cold eyes. At this moment, Lu Zhenxi felt like he was a dish. If Ming Yu liked sweet and sour, he was sweet and sour. If Ming Yu liked braised, then he was braised. He was shark\u2019s fin if Ming Yu liked shark\u2019s fin, and he was pig\u2026</p><br/><p>Bah! Who was a pig?</p><br/><p>As if he wasn\u2019t aware of the other person\u2019s thoughts, Ming Yu was trying to figure out \u2018how a woman betrayed by her lover would hide her anger, but it isn\u2019t completely able to be hidden.\u2019 He carefully thought for a moment before his eyes narrowed, sending icy knives straight towards Lu Zhenxi.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this murderous air? He was supposed to splash water, not murder the boyfriend!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t pay attention to Lu Zhenxi\u2019s shaking as he sneered and asked, \u201cSteak? Who did you eat steak with yesterday? Did you think I wouldn\u2019t see it?\u201d Ming Yu\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously, looking Lu Zhenxi up and down.</p><br/><p>The eyes were cold and ruthless, as if looking at something dead. The arrogant and bloody air caused Lu Zhenxi to involuntarily shake.</p><br/><p>How was this looking at the lover who betrayed you? This was the executioner watching the pork on the chopping block!!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sneered while holding the cup and snapped, \u201cWho is that woman? You were with that woman!\u201d Ming Yu prepared to throw the water as he spoke, \u201cYou dare to cheat, you dare to find another person, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI quit!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the water was thrown, Lu Zhenxi suddenly yelled and stood up, making everyone startled. But the spilled water couldn\u2019t be recovered, so everyone could only watch as the water poured straight towards Lu Zhenxi\u2019s\u2026 crotch. The white pants became wet, causing a urine effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d A\u2019Xue couldn\u2019t help laughing loudly.</p><br/><p>Old Chen\u2019s shoulder shook but he humanely turned around to hide his laughter.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi, \u201c!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, blood rushed to Lu Zhenxi\u2019s face as he stared at his crotch. He trembled slightly with shame, then he angrily banged on the table and cried out, \u201cMing Yu! You did it on purpose! You spilled water on my pants on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu slightly frowned. \u201cI wanted to splash water on your face, per the script. You were the one who stood up, making me pour it on your crotch.\u201d Ming Yu paused, speaking to the crowd, \u201cA\u2019Xue, do you have tissues? Lu Zhenxi doesn\u2019t look elegant, so he needs to clean up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The already laughing A\u2019Xue replied, \u201cPfft, cough\u2026I have some.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Yu received the tissues and tried to help Lu Zhenxi clean himself. However, he just raised a hand and didn\u2019t move. The position\u2026 cough. He looked up at Lu Zhenxi and suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wipe it yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi, \u201c\u201c\uff08\u256c\u2594\u2594\uff09!! Ming Yu! You must\u2019ve done it on purpose!\u201d The angrily trembling Lu Zhenxi turned to Brother Yuan and shouted, \u201cBrother Yuan, you saw it! He acted like he wanted to kill me! He wasn\u2019t looking at me like a person! It is completely different from our script. How could he do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu blinked with surprise at these words. \u201cI didn\u2019t act according to the script?\u201d Ming Yu looked at Brother Yuan and sincerely said, \u201cI studied the script more than 10 times and carefully figured out the character\u2019s psychological state.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan, A\u2019Zhao, A\u2019Xue and Old Chen, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He tried to figure out the character\u2019s mental state, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at the angry and ashamed Lu Zhenxi, Brother Yuan had to speak up, otherwise the atmosphere might become worse.</p><br/><p>Thus, Brother Yuan stood up and said, \u201cLu Zhenxi, this is really your fault. You are performing, how can you say that you will quit? A\u2019Zhao just had two glasses of water splashed on him. It isn\u2019t a big deal, so don\u2019t think about it to much. Ming Yu spilling it on your\u2026 well, the position was a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi had to swallow his resentment after Brother Yuan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The anger over his crotch situation slowly faded, leaving Lu Zhenxi calm and not as rattled.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi wiped at his pants with the tissues for a long time before looking at Brother Yuan and saying calmly, \u201cBrother Yuan, Ming Yu\u2019s acting is really too bad. You saw it. I have no way to act opposite that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu frowned at suddenly being accused of acting poorly, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan knew that Lu Zhenxi was right. He turned his head to speak to Ming Yu. \u201cMing Yu, your acting\u2026 there seems to be a problem. Your eyes were wrong when looking at Lu Zhenxi, the smile was wrong, and the tone of words was a little stiff. I want to ask; did you really study the script more than 10 times?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu sighed at the words aad replied, \u201cYes Brother Yuan. I think I studied it at least 12, 13 times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan\u2019s expression became strange at this and he coughed. \u201cBased on your performance, I probably have to give you special teachings.\u201d He glanced over at Lu Zhenxi and continued, \u201cYou too, Lu Zhenxi. Ming Yu is new and his acting is poor. Your cooperation with him wasn\u2019t good. You should learn to control your temper.\u201d</p><br/><p>A touch of disdain flashed in Lu Zhenxi as he nodded. \u201cYes, Brother Yuan. I will be understanding of people with poor acting skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu who had poor acting skills, \u201c^\uff3f^#\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite this \u2018humiliation\u2019, the young man was still smiling gently, not showing any sadness. Ming Yu might have such a clear appearance, but A\u2019Zhao and the others looked at him with complicated expressions.</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan clapped his hands and the two people quickly descended from the stage. A\u2019Zhao looked at Lu Zhenxi, who couldn\u2019t hide his triumphant smile, and couldn\u2019t help crying out, \u201cBrother Yuan, this matter can\u2019t be entirely blamed on Ming Yu! In the rehearsals just now, Old Lu didn\u2019t pay attention at all, leaving MIng Yu to read the script alone! For a full 30 minutes, I saw them only talking once. After that, Old Lu was playing with his phone while Ming Yu carefully studied the script!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu glanced up at these words, his lips curving as he looked at the upright A\u2019Zhao.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

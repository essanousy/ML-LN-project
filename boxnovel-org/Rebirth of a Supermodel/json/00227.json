No, even if there was a contract, would there even be a time limit? Had you ever seen a person who wrote in the contract, \u2018I will hire a certain person as a global spokesperson for eight years?\u2019 Who had heard of such a thing?</p><br/><p>On the surface, this announcement was to change Ji and Ya\u2019s global spokesperson. From another angle, it also gave many fashion lovers a hint of something else. This type of hunch was proven the next day without a need for them to discuss it for a long time. Xi Ze personally released a long post on his muse fan forum.</p><br/><p>Since becoming a model of Muse, it was rare for Xi Ze to post on the forum.</p><br/><p>The fan forum was mainly for fans to communicate with each other. Sometimes Xi Ze\u2019s agent team would also post about his latest news to let fans know. Xi Ze kept the frequency of posting on the fan forum to every three or four months. In the past two years, this frequency became lower and lower.</p><br/><p>But today, the first thing fans felt when opening the long red stickied note wasn\u2019t surprise that the god finally posted, it was a silent grief.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s first words were:</p><br/><p>\u3010 Today I will end my modelling career. \u3011</p><br/><p>The topic of this long post was directly announced, causing the fans who saw it to be red-eyed.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Life is short and eight years have passed in the blink of an eye. Eight years ago, I never wanted to be a model. My teacher pushed me to that position and I also felt that standing on the runway felt good.</p><br/><p>The clothes that I designed can be expressed by myself. This type of thing is probably what every designer wants to pursue.</p><br/><p>I have seen too many landscapes while in the spotlight. You pushed me step by step to the top position and it is a great honour to stay here for eight years. It was very cold and lonely. There was no path to retreat but this made me happier.</p><br/><p>There is no retreat in life, every fork is a fateful choice. Please let me arrogantly say that before meeting my lover, I was very lonely. I walked alone surrounded by darkness and no one could help me.</p><br/><p>I liked interpreting the feeling of an outfit, making me feel that I have caught their souls. But I prefer to personally design and make an outfit. I am an arrogant person so this makes me feel that I am the creator of the world.</p><br/><p>Every time an outfit appeared, I felt like I was creating life. They are my children and become the most beautiful and dazzling beings in the world in my eyes. They receive the brilliance and glory they deserve.</p><br/><p>But am I really the only one who can show off their beauty?</p><br/><p>I am 27 years old this year and I increasingly feel that my strength isn\u2019t enough. I don\u2019t have the energy to invest my time and left into two equally exciting careers. Then I have to make a choice.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Eight years is short but you and I still have a long time ahead\u3002</p><br/><p>If you are willing to still follow me, I will be waiting for you at Ji and Ya\u2019s runway shows.</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t want to follow me, my lover is also very good. He is the only muse in my life. [Laugh] \u3011 Once they saw his last laugh, countless fans directly held their phones or sat in front of a computer and cried.</p><br/><p>Many fans had said this before but they hoped that Xi Ze wouldn\u2019t be too tired and that he would pursue his favourite things. He wasn\u2019t a god and didn\u2019t have too much energy. He should take care of his body.</p><br/><p>They knew that Xi Ze would be ready to retire soon but once this moment came, they found that their self-righteousness was like a bubble that completely popped when they touched it.</p><br/><p>However, they also knew that Xi Ze\u2019s choice was correct. He was no longer an energetic teenage or youth in his early 20s. He was faced with the dual psychological pressure of being a designer and supermodel. Eventually, he would have to give up one of them.</p><br/><p>The sound of crying was heard from every corner of the world once they found out that they couldn\u2019t see this man\u2019s interpretation on the runway any longer. If he appeared, it would be as a designer to thank all the guests, rather than showing off a beautiful outfit.</p><br/><p>But this result was also quite good.</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to be with God Xi QAQ I will always support God Xi! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I will never leave God Xi! I particularly like Ji and Ya\u2019s design style, especially God Xi! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I will always support you and your wife!!! \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>Within three days, there were countless fan posts on Xi Ze\u2019s fan forum.</p><br/><p>There were more than 40 million fans. It was natural for most of them to almost never talk. At this moment, they all went online to express their gratitude and well wishes. They were grateful for Xi Ze\u2019s eight years and wished for a better future for him.</p><br/><p>For a time, the highest daily visits to the Muse official website broke through 70 million!</p><br/><p>Due to the number of posts in one day, the official website\u2019s server crashed.</p><br/><p>At the same time, many people weren\u2019t Muse models so they could only express their blessings on Weibo and Twitter.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Kruka Wiesen: I will always support you. You have always been my idol! @Xi Ze \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Harriman Owen: When Xi Ze became the fifth ranked supermodel, I was already fourth. At that time, I thought that this teenager with unlimited potential is simply a nightmare for all supermodels. No one has the power to stop him because he is the deserving king. He should stand in the top position. Now you have chosen to retire. Bless you my friend, your future will be even better @Xi Ze \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Adenes Clark: Hey, go well @ Xi Ze \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Cecilia Cote: Actually, I once liked him but it was just once. Good luck @Xi Ze \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Anna Cartman: Cecilia is lying again. How was it just once? Didn\u2019t you cry when Xi Ze announced his relationship? Now you are a CP fan. Xi Ze, I will tell you that Cecilia secretly has an account on the forum for your CP fans. Finally, I wish you good luck @Xi Ze \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Xu Rongrong: The first time I saw @Xi Ze was when I first entered the company. I saw him come down in the elevator and thought about when I could have such a powerful momentum like him. I haven\u2019t achieved it yet but I hope that @Xi Ze can live well in the future. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Du Ruo: @Xi Ze is an old friend for many years. I won\u2019t reveal your disadvantages in public. Instead I will support you and your wife, wishing you well in the future. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Luo Cheng: QAQ Why am I crying\u2026 @Xi Ze \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Raymond Cote: Focusing on design? Then focus on design! @Xi Ze \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 He Chaoman: Big nephew @Xi Ze, since you have retired, can I also retire? \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s retirement simply caused a storm in the fashion industry!</p><br/><p>Countless celebrities posted messages. Apart from Ming Yu and Xi Ze, the top 100 male and female supermodels expressed their well wishes on their social media accounts, even if they weren\u2019t high-ranking. IT was the same for first-tier, second-tier and even eighteen-tier non-supermodels.</p><br/><p>Some of these people expressed enthusiasm or jealousy, but in the hearts of most people, they really felt very lost.</p><br/><p>For the past eight years, all models regarded Xi Ze as the leader of the supermodel industry. It really felt strange now that he was retiring.</p><br/><p>Were they happy? No. Were they lost? Yes but consider one point.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze really wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t leaving the fashion world, only the supermodel industry.</p><br/><p>So many people expressed their stance and the media dug out a lot of big news. For example, Cecilia had a crush on Xi Ze! For example, after Cecilia lost her love, she became Xi Ze and Ming Yu\u2019s CP fan and even mixed in with the fan circle!</p><br/><p>Why did so many models and stars like to open side accounts these days. First it was Xiao Biqing and now Cecilia.</p><br/><p>There were fans who said: \u3010 This year, supermodels and stars have started to reveal their fan side accounts. If one day God Xi and mushroom also open a side account, I will live eating dog food! Delicious dog food 2333333 \u3011</p><br/><p>This CP fan never thought that in the days to follow, these words would unexpectedly become a prophecy\u2026 but this wasn\u2019t something to talk about for the moment.</p><br/><p>In addition to models, the world\u2019s four top luxury brands apart from Ji and Ya, Rosalind, Otilla and Garcia blessing Xi Ze on their official social media accounts. Their chief designers, assistant designers and other staff members expressed their wishes on their private accounts.</p><br/><p>Under the leadership of several top luxury brands, other brands around the world also made statements about the matter, increasing Xi Ze\u2019s value.</p><br/><p>In early December, there was a 10 day frenzy for fashion lovers all over the world.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu reaching the top was just the beginning while Xi Ze\u2019s retirement was the climax.</p><br/><p>Among so many blessings, He Chaoman\u2019s words were noticed by many people. They cried out with surprise: \u3010 Oh my god? What big nephew? Who is the big nephew? In addition, you must never retire! You must stay in the industry for years QAQ!! \u3011</p><br/><p>After that, He Chaoman publicly said: \u3010 Ah, it was just a joke. Don\u2019t mind it. \u3011 Her fans were relieved:\u3010 It is just a joke. \u3011</p><br/><p>Who knew that a minute later, He Chaoman would once again say: \u3010 Oh, my words were ambiguous. Retiring is a joke but the big nephew part is true. Right, big nephew @Xi Ze? \u3011</p><br/><p>The global fans who were suddenly told such explosive news: \u2026.</p><br/><p>Designers, photographers, stylists, tailors, magazine editors\u2026 models. All of them spoke but they didn\u2019t think the World Supermodels Organization would publicly speak at this time. They posted on their Twitter and Weibo accounts:</p><br/><p>\u3010 Congratulations @Xi Ze on your successful departure from the stage.</p><br/><p>Perhaps a lot of people think that your departure isn\u2019t perfect. In order to make up for these regrets, the World Supermodels Organization will announce the latest points calculated: Xi Ze \u2013 3891 points, Ming Yu \u2013 3881 points, Cecilia Cote \u2013 3616 points.</p><br/><p>Congratulations, you are the well-deserved first in the world. \u3011</p><br/><p>Once the score was released, everyone was shocked and there was an uproar. A few days ago, Ming Yu\u2019s name was above Xi Ze. How did Xi Ze suddenly surpass Ming Yu?</p><br/><p>Then the World Supermodels Organization posted again: \u3010 10 days ago, Xi Ze\u2019s score was 3887 points while Ming Yu was 3888 points. \u3011 It was a gap of just one point!</p><br/><p>Just one point!</p><br/><p>In fact, everyone knew that the World Supermodels Organization published the supermodel rankings every three months. When the rankings list was published, Ming Yu\u2019s score was one point higher than Xi Ze. But after that? The score could change in those three months. How could Ming Yu always press Xi Ze down?</p><br/><p>It was only possible to forever pressure a person when the gap between two models was particularly large. However, everyone knew that the difference between the two people was very small. Now that Xi Ze chose to retire, it was possible for his score to surpass Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Once they saw this result, the fashion lovers didn\u2019t go to the World Supermodels Organization and scold them about being early for the first time. Instead, they excitedly expressed their gratitude.</p><br/><p>Even Ming Yu\u2019s fans were very supportive of the World Supermodels Organization\u2019s behavior. They knew that Ming Yu\u2019s strength was comparable to Xi Ze. If Xi Ze chose to not retreat, it would really be unknown who would be first the next time.</p><br/><p>However, some sunspots expressed dissatisfaction with the World Supermodels Organization\u2019s announcement of Cecilia\u2019s score. They knew that the World Supermodels Organization wanted to publish the first ranked supermodel to show that Xi Ze was the well-deserved first but\u2026 the gap was too big!</p><br/><p>It just made Cecilia look bad! In any case, it was the organization\u2019s fault!</p><br/><p>However, Cecilia stood up at this time: \u3010 Don\u2019t talk about it again. When I saw how much lower my score was compared to @Xi Ze and @Ming Yu, I knew I should keep trying. But I can finally see my name with the mushroom husbands\u2026 ahhhh \uff08*\u2267\u25bd\u2266\uff09\u30c4!!! \u3011</p><br/><p>Global fans: \u2026Where was their cold angel goddess? The sister they were so obsessed with had fallen!</p><br/><p>At the end of the day, there was only one crucial person who hadn\u2019t spoken yet.</p><br/><p>Everyone around the world turned their eyes to this person\u2019s Muse fan forum and Weibo, waiting for him to speak.</p><br/><p>At this moment, it had been three hours since the announcement of Xi Ze\u2019s retirement.</p><br/><p>Then it was four hours, five hours, six hours, seven hours\u2026</p><br/><p>Eight hours passed!</p><br/><p>Fans were feeling restless and wondering why this person wasn\u2019t saying anything when Xi Ze\u2019s lover finally made a long speech. Everyone immediately poured into his Muse fan forum to read this post.</p><br/><p>The agitated fans clicked onto this post and their eyes widened with amazement.</p><br/><p>Then tears filled their eyes as they once again sobbed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

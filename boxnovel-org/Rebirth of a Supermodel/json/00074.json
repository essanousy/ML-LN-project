At the age of 15, she was discovered by a scout and took a street shot for a magazine. From then on, she embarked on the path of a model.</p><br/><p>Once becoming a model, Du Ruo\u2019s body, stature and temperament weren\u2019t unique. But there were tens of millions of models in the world and she managed to be ranked third among the females. She appeared on dozens of the world\u2019s super model rankings lists.</p><br/><p>A fashionista in the industry once commented on Du Ruo, \u201cShe has the beauty that all men dream of. She is sexy and enchanting, beautiful and mature. She is the envoy of all women. She is the most charming devil on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026These words might be exaggerated, but one thing could be seen from the evaluation of \u2018female devil\u2019 instead of \u2018female angel.\u2019 Du Ruo\u2019s beauty was an offensive type. It was a rose hidden behind a thornbush that not everyone could touch.</p><br/><p>Of course, if Du Ruo\u2019s temper was more significant, she really would be like a thorny rose. It would be difficult for Du Ruo, who had an ordinary background, to reach her current status. For a model to reach such a high status, could you really say that she wasn\u2019t scheming?</p><br/><p>Even the silly and sweet Zhao Rui wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo wasn\u2019t a Muse model, meaning Cheng Su had no contact with her. He only heard Zeng Shu mention once, \u201cDu Ruo is easy to get along with. Among the world\u2019s top 10 models, her temper is the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did having a good temper mean she could be bullied?</p><br/><p>Cheng Su, you are really too naive.</p><br/><p>This time, Cheng Su really created a problem. Zeng Shu\u2019s first thought was to discuss with the program organizers to make sure that scene wasn\u2019t shown. As long as it wasn\u2019t aired to the general public, Zeng Shu could talk to Rayleigh Cano and it wasn\u2019t cause too much of a loss.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu knew that this reality show was one of the hottest in the country and that the producer had a strong background in the entertainment industry. If the other person didn\u2019t agree to delete the scene, he could make the company put pressure on him.</p><br/><p>Whether it was fashion or entertainment, Muse had a high status.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu didn\u2019t leave anything to chance. This scene was a small hot spot in the reality show and couldn\u2019t be easily deleted. It was also scandalous and the program would smell a business opportunity, so they wouldn\u2019t easily give it up.</p><br/><p>Thus, Zeng Shu went to find Shen Xiang to have him talk with the program staff.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu sat down in Shen Xiang\u2019s office and only said half of what he wanted to say. Unexpectedly, he saw Shen Xiang scowling while drinking coffee, then Shen Xiang sighed helplessly. He said with regret and disappointment, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Zeng Shu. This time, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu was shocked by the words.</p><br/><p>It had been several years since he came to the company. He might not be as close to Shen Xiang as Ding Bo, but they were old friends. For Shen Xiang to unexpectedly reject him without hesitation, wasn\u2019t this situation too strange?</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu wasn\u2019t angry. He lowered his cup and asked, \u201cI thought this was a trivial thing. Is it unexpectedly a major incident?\u201d He thought for a moment before asking again, \u201cIs the producer\u2019s background really strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu thought that Shen Xiang had talked to a producer who refused to help.</p><br/><p>This was normal. Zeng Shu was aware that Shen Xiang and the PR department ranked the models. According to his guess, Cheng Su\u2019s level of attention should be above a first-tier model and below a supermodel. If the background of the other producer was really deep, the company wouldn\u2019t make trouble with them just because of Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>His heart might be very anxious, but Zeng Shu still looked calm as he waited for Shen Xiang\u2019s affirmation.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect to see Shen Xiang shake his head helplessly. \u201cThe producer is nothing. He will give Muse face. Zeng Shu, the problem isn\u2019t the program but a problem with Cheng Su.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu was startled. He asked with confusion, \u201cWhat is the problem with Cheng Su?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su, this kid wasn\u2019t clever but how could he poke a basket that made Shen Xiang concerned?</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang asked, \u201cDo you know who is participating in the reality show this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu thought for a moment and replied. \u201cThere are the four original guests, a small model called Liu Qian, Lanka\u2019s elder sister Du Ruo and our company\u2019s\u2026\u201d Zeng Shu\u2019s voice trailed off before he asked, \u201cIs it related to Ming Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>A dim light flashed in Shen Xiang\u2019s eyes when he heard this name, but he shook his head and replied. \u201cIt has nothing to do with Ming Yu. Cheng Su sinned against Du Ruo.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the reason why Cheng Su was cursed at by Zeng Shu the moment he picked up the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDu Ruo is 22 years old. Do you think she got her status today at the age of 22 by being a herbivore? You actually managed to step on someone who has a good temper? Cheng Su, I have never seen someone like you. Are you blind? She is Du Ruo! She isn\u2019t you! How big are you that you dare to provoke Du Ruo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su was scolded for a full 10 minutes before he understood Zeng Shu\u2019s words. He replied in a confused manner. \u201cBrother Zeng, I really didn\u2019t provoke Du Ruo. Even if you gave me the courage of 10 people, I couldn\u2019t provoke her! If you don\u2019t believe me, ask the program staff. I barely interacted with her, so how could I offend her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already know that you tried to punish her on the program. What type of dog poop have you eaten Cheng Su? Do you think that you are the best because you endorsed a second-tier brand? Why don\u2019t you go to heaven? At the age of 17, Du Ruo was the global spokesperson for a first-tier luxury brand. Do you know what rank she was in the world\u2019s supermodel rankings? 9th! What about you? You can\u2019t even see her shadow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su didn\u2019t dare refute anything as he listened to Zeng Shu. He knew that his agent had the ability to make him a supermodel and to also pull him down from the top.</p><br/><p>Then Cheng Su heard Zeng Shu say, \u201cDu Ruo might be playing around, but anybody related to her, such as her team member, can\u2019t be touched!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su had a sudden thought. \u201cBrother Zeng, I really didn\u2019t offend Sister Du. It must be Ming Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu suddenly stopped talking.</p><br/><p>He just listened as Cheng Su continued, \u201cBrother Zeng, as you know, Ming Yu has always been tangled up with me. He is annoying and gave me several jobs early on. This time, he deliberately went against me on the show. I was tangled up by him and accidentally became involved with Du Ruo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheng Su.\u201d Zeng Shu\u2019s calm and cold voice suddenly interrupted Cheng Su\u2019s speculation. He sighed and said, \u201cCheng Su, I didn\u2019t tell you so you aren\u2019t to blame. You still don\u2019t understand properly. Ming Yu\u2019s future will definitely reach your head. His achievements can\u2019t be lower than yours. The previous events have passed. He is no longer obsessed with you and has no relationship with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s throat clogged up and he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu\u2019s words completely poked at the heart of Cheng Su\u2019s arrogant narcissism.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu naturally know how much the previous Ming Yu was obsessed with Cheng Su. He also knew how much opportunities Ming Yu had given to Cheng Su. However, Zeng Shu had met Ming Yu several times since then and became acutely aware that the current Ming Yu wasn\u2019t an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>The current Ming Yu definitely didn\u2019t like Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>It was absolutely impossible for the current Ming Yu to be worse than Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>In fact, Zeng Shu actually felt a little bit of regret. He wanted to stab at Zhao Rui, but why did he aim for Cheng Su instead of Ming Yu?</p><br/><p>In the end, the one who was a real diamond and the one who was ordinary and defective could clearly be seen by anyone smart!</p><br/><p>In addition, Zeng Shu noticed that when he mentioned Ming Yu several times today, Shen Xiang had changed the topic very quickly. It was as if he didn\u2019t want to talk about Ming Yu. What did this mean?</p><br/><p>This suggested that in Shen Xiang\u2019s eyes, Ming Yu was very important. At least, he was more important than Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu also guessed that Du Ruo was just a cover. The underlying reason for the company\u2019s indifferent in Cheng Su\u2019s matter was because of Ming Yu. It was just like in the past, when a man put pressure on Zeng Shu because of the man\u2019s so-called friends status with a small model, making Zeng Shu personally come and apologize to Ming Yu\u2026</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t important right now.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu was more concerned about something else. \u201cCheng Su, I have temporarily cancelled your job that will take place in half a month. I hope that you will spend this month thinking about your status in the industry. How many people are pressing down on your head? They have had many years and you are just a brave newcomer with potential. In this huge fashion industry, you can\u2019t imagine how many people can crush you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The afternoon of the same day, Shen Xiang sighed with relief once Zeng Shu left the Muse PR department.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang headed straight to the top floor of the company after handling an emergency. He walked through the transparent glass corridor and passed by the pebbled stream. Shen Xiang knocked on the mahogany door and once he got a \u201cCome in,\u201d he gently pushed open the door. The occupant had his head bow and was carefully sketching a new design on the work table.</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang talked about some major events in the company that the man might be interested in. At the end, he remembered and mentioned, \u201cZeng Shu came to see me this afternoon. Xi Ze, I followed your words and rejected him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze drew the last stroke on his design and looked up. He asked, \u201cWhat did Zeng Shu say when he left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang recalled, \u201cHe seemed to say that he would take Cheng Su and personally got to apologize to Du Ruo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze gently hummed and no longer continued the topic. The two people discussed recent events in the industry. Then Shen Xiang decided to return to the PR department to continue his work.</p><br/><p>Before he left, Shen Xiang had reached the mahogany door when he couldn\u2019t help turning back and asking, \u201cCheng Su, this matter might cause great controversy. But there two extremes that this matter can cause. The first, it is no big problem and the difficulty can be overcome. The second is that he will be completely abandoned by the endorsers and his future will be affected. I can do both cases. Xi Ze, what do you want me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The room was silent for a long time. Shen Xiang thought he wouldn\u2019t get an answer, but then Xi Ze slowly raised his eyes and looked at Shen Xiang deeply. He said quietly, \u201cLeave this matter to Zeng Shu. You don\u2019t have to interfere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang couldn\u2019t help crying out, \u201cZeng Shu will probably settle this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze replied, \u201cThen let him settle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen XIang thought it was unexpected. \u201cXi Ze, what do you mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Using Du Ruo as the reason, didn\u2019t Xi Ze pressure Cheng Su in order to punish him for the actions towards Xi Ze\u2019s little muse?</p><br/><p>\u201cCheng Su will be responsible for himself. Du Ruo won\u2019t mind, but if Du Ruo was replaced by any of the world\u2019s top 10 supermodels, don\u2019t mention my bad temper, if it was Luo Cheng, Cecelia or even Chaoman\u2026he would never be able to rear his head again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang\u2019s first thought after hearing this was, \u2018\u2026So you know how bad your temper is.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xi Ze ignored Shen Xiang\u2019s thoughts and added, \u201cIn addition, the person he offended isn\u2019t me. I just handed it over to that person. He will give the real punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Xiang: \u201c\u2192_\u2192\u201d That person, was it your little muse\u2026</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s expression was relaxed and saying \u2018that person can solve it himself.\u2019</p><br/><p>But once he found out that Ming Yu was sick to such a degree, Xi Ze regretted it. He hated that he believed the other person could take care of himself and made a mistake. He sent a text message to Du Ruo that had only had a few words: \u3010 You didn\u2019t say he was sick. \u3011</p><br/><p>The beautiful Du Ruo after seeing it, \u201c\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t his mother or his secretary!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

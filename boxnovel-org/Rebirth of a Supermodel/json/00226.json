How many people looked at the male supermodel rankings and subconsciously started from the second place? After the appearance of Adenes, they started watching from the third place!</p><br/><p>It was because first place would never change.</p><br/><p>He was the most well-deserved first, no one could shake his throne in the fashion world.</p><br/><p>Now the king had finally came down from the throne at the summit and let an equally outstanding young man climb up.</p><br/><p>This feeling was really amazing. Once they saw the name \u2018Ming Yu\u2019 in first place and the fact that the World Supermodels Organization even changed the background, every fashion lover in the world was stunned and couldn\u2019t recover for a long time.</p><br/><p>There were soon many posts and comments on the official website of the World Supermodels Organization.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Today is really the end of a legendary era. I never admitted it before but I actually really like Xi Ze. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I used to say how no one could pull Xi Ze down but now that it actually happened, I feel a bit sad\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 No matter what, Xi Ze is the best supermodel I have ever seen! \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>It was clear that the day before yesterday, people were saying things like \u2018Xi Ze is occupying a latrine but not shitting\u2019 or \u2018Xi Ze is neglecting his duties and ignoring his proper occupation.\u2019 But once this actually happened, these people felt a trace of melancholy and loss.</p><br/><p>He was a man who blocked the world\u2019s supermodels with irresistible force. He was a beacon of the fashion circle, illuminating the dark sea and letting everyone look up at him with respect and even chasing after him.</p><br/><p>Today, that lighthouse was finally replaced by another shining star.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans were happy for a while. Everyone was so excited that they couldn\u2019t speak. They could only express their ecstasy with \u2018ahhhhh\u2019 on the Weibo and fan forums. But slowly, they also started to feel a type of depression</p><br/><p>At this time, Xi Ze\u2019s fans were happily blessing Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>They expressed their best wishes to this outstanding latecomer, wishing for him to replace Xi Ze as the global leader of the male supermodels, letting the supermodels shine more in the world. There were even fans who published a long note.</p><br/><p>\u3010 From the first moment I saw Xi Ze in a magazine eight years ago, I knew that he wouldn\u2019t be a complete model. The thing that God Xi likes most is designing. I once saw one of his documentaries and in that documentary, there was a type of joyful expression on his face when making an outfit that really can\u2019t fool anyone.</p><br/><p>Fashion is inter-connected so God Xi also pursues showing off the beauty of clothing. However, everyone\u2019s goal is different. If he had to choose between \u2018showing beautiful clothes\u2019 and \u2018creating beautiful clothes\u2019, I believe that God Xi won\u2019t hesitate to choose the latter.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu is a good model and he is very dedicated. I can feel it every time he walks in a show. He really likes the industry and enjoys the process of showing off every piece of clothing. Compared with him, God Xi really isn\u2019t a qualified model.</p><br/><p>But today, I want to say something: God Xi, pursue what you want! You are human, not a god! I like you for so many years. You must be exhausted every day from having multiple jobs!</p><br/><p>No matter what your status, you are my favourite Xi Ze! \u3011 This note made many of Xi Ze\u2019s fans have a deep understanding. After that, this post was stickied by the moderators of the Muse fan forum and was kept on the first page by the fans. The responses exceeded 30,000 in one day.</p><br/><p>However, Xi Ze and Ding Bo didn\u2019t respond to this incident.</p><br/><p>December in Huaxia\u2019s capital was cold and snowy. The ground was wrapped in snow and few people walked outdoors due to the cold air. As soon as they left a heated place, people couldn\u2019t wait to speed up and quickly enter a heated place.</p><br/><p>Once Xi Ze returned to the apartment, fine snow was already falling outside.</p><br/><p>The security measures for this apartment were very good, with a total of three glass doors required to go from the outside to the inside. Every door needed the owner\u2019s fingerprint to pass, otherwise they would have to find the owner of the building to release it.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly passed through the first door and then the second. Just as he reached the third door, he suddenly heard faint footsteps behind him.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked around and was startled when he saw the person who arrived.</p><br/><p>In the bright lights, the beautiful face of the young man was more dazzling. The light-coloured eyes were bright and sparkling, while the facial features were extremely delicate. His body seemed harmless, apart from the narrow eyes which revealed a fascinating scent.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s fans always said: \u3010 My mushroom is really enchanting! \u3011 This sentence was never false. A person could lose their soul to this youth, how could he not be enchanting?</p><br/><p>In this world, only Xi Ze knew that this young man would be even more beautiful at certain times!</p><br/><p>He was enthralling while his eyes and eyebrows were so charming that the most fragrant wine couldn\u2019t compare to him.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was surprised to see his lover at this moment but he soon reacted by raising his eyebrows. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go upstairs and was waiting for me?\u201d Xi Ze didn\u2019t wait for Ming Yu\u2019s reaction and smiled. \u201cThis scene is a bit familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s lips curved. \u201cOh? How is it familiar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was also interested as he looked down at the youth in front of him. His thin lips slightly twitched as Xi Ze stared at Ming Yu for a while before asking, \u201cMing Yu? It is a coincidence that I met you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu smiled and nodded at the words. \u201cOh Mr. Xi, do you live here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t seem aware of the ridicule in the youth\u2019s words. Since the other person changed his lines, Xi Ze changed them in the same way, \u201cYou originally lived here. There is a good bedroom nearby. Since we met so coincidentally, isn\u2019t it better to sit and talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu scoffed at the words and both of them entered the building. Then Ming Yu said, \u201cYou changed the lines.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze spread open his hands innocently. \u201cYou changed it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu couldn\u2019t refute it. \u201cWe aren\u2019t still living in the Muse apartment so of course we have to change it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze also answered righteously. \u201cThere is no cafe near here, I also have to change it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the two of them had been busy lately, there were few opportunities to squabble face to face. This feeling was really strange. After all, the two of them had been in love for more than two years and knew the depths of each other, no matter how experienced.</p><br/><p>For example, did Ming Yu really think Xi Ze was a god? Did he have no shortcomings?</p><br/><p>Wrong!</p><br/><p>It seemed true on the surface. There was nothing to say about his career achievements. This man cooked delicious dishes, and his room was always clean and neat from his obsession with cleanliness.</p><br/><p>Did this Xi Ze have shortcomings?</p><br/><p>Of course he did.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu knew that his lover was fearless. Whenever they argued, Ming Yu would lose nine out of ten times. But! Xi Ze was very afraid of any furry creatures! This ranged from scary lions and tigers and cute and smart puppies and kittens.</p><br/><p>As long as they had fur and as long as they moved!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze would become completely tense and afraid to breathe.</p><br/><p>But this evening, Ming Yu took the initiative to provoke the memories of the two of them, causing strange feelings to return to their hearts. Once the two people got on the elevator, Xi Ze\u2019s desire to role-play didn\u2019t subside. He asked casually, \u201cYou are the person I am looking for. Ming Yu, are you willing to be my muse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t touched at all when he heard this. He directly waved it off. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze licked his lips. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu nodded. \u201cOf course! What does it mean to be your muse. Am I not your muse right now? Since this is the case, you can only choose one option between \u2018husband\u2019 and \u2018muse.\u2019 Which one do you want me to be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze laughed at the words. \u201cI want you to be my \u2018wife\u2019 and \u2018muse\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s mouth turned down. \u201cHusband!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze solemnly shook his head. \u201cWife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, yes yes, wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, one party first provoked the sentimental and fun memory. After entering the house, Xi Ze actively bend down and kissed his youth. The two men took off their clothes from the entrance to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>In the end, the two people sat in the bedroom as Mr. Xi said.</p><br/><p>His emotions surged during the deepest time and Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, speaking out the words hidden deep in his heart. \u201cXi Ze, I defeated you. From now on, I will forever press down on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s voice was low and sexy, there was a hint of deep desire it in but he also wanted to remain rational.</p><br/><p>The man responded to him by suddenly stopping. As Ming Yu looked up at him with tearful and confused eyes, Xi Ze suddenly turned him over, making the youth let out a suppressed groan.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the wicked man smiled and said, \u201cSince you started pressing on me today, then tonight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, person above me, you should move yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t a thick-skinned person. Do you think he would be shy enough to shout \u2018shameless rogue\u2019 and then be teased by Mr. Xi? It was absolutely impossible! Mr. Xi never thought that this youth had already suppressed him in the world supermodel rankings and also easily suppressed him in bed!</p><br/><p>Moving on his own? It was a piece of cake!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze never imagined that he was dropping a stone on his own foot. In the end, he was seduced by this charming and enchanting youth!</p><br/><p>After all, didn\u2019t Mr. Xi think his small mushroom was a goblin? \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>The first time, Xi Ze didn\u2019t make a fuss as Ming Yu moved above him and lost face. Then Xi Ze quickly used his strength to regain control. The youth let out beautiful moans all night before eventually passing out.</p><br/><p>Ah, an old married couple, how could they still be so steamy?</p><br/><p>This was the first day that Ming Xiaoyu surpassed Xi Ze in the rankings. The next day, Ming Xiaoyu said very solemnly, \u201cI have pressed you on the world supermodel rankings so can\u2019t I be the top once?\u201d</p><br/><p>That evening, Mr. Xi found another reason to push Ming Yu down.</p><br/><p>It was the same on the third day and the fourth day!</p><br/><p>Once it was the fifth day, Ming Xiaoyu no longer mentioned this matter. The reason was because when he chattered with Luo Cheng, this stupid puppy said in a depressed manner, \u201cOh, being on top is too tiring! I wanted to attack once but when I tried it, I thought it was too hard! I\u2019m telling you, it is much easier and more fun to lie down and accept it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The originally hesitant Ming Yu heard this and never mentioned the matter again.</p><br/><p>But Ming Xiaoyu found that he couldn\u2019t \u2018lie down and accept it!\u2019</p><br/><p>The two of them often liked to play and act while doing papapa, papapa! Who would be satisfied by lying down and pretending to accept it?</p><br/><p>Over time, the major change in the world supermodel rankings was slowly accepted by more and more people. After a full week, the media stopped paying attention to this matter and turned their eyes to other things.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, as if not afraid of trouble, Ji and Ya released a message on their official website that instantly set off stormy waves in the global fashion industry.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Announcement: The contract with Ji and Ya\u2019s global spokesperson, Xi Ze has expired. We will announce a new global spokesperson this month. \u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Brother Zhao? That is impossible, he wouldn\u2019t dare say such things to you. Sister Luo is even more impossible, she knows discretion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked at the youth sitting beside him and said, \u201cIt looks like this matter is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026#$#$#$!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was bluffing!</p><br/><p>The handsome man in the driver\u2019s seat frowned and said with a sigh, \u201cYou made me be laughed at by that old man for a whole day. Until a few days ago, he was always making fun of me, hurting my fragile young mind. I am very hurt, Small Mushroom. What should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>After all this time, couldn\u2019t Xi Ze forget about this mushroom thing? And calling himself fragile and young? He was actually hurt?</p><br/><p>Forget Luo Cheng, not even Zhao Rui would believe it! (Luo Cheng and Zhao Rui: Hey!)</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s mouth twitched as he looked at the man\u2019s expression of \u2018I am very hurt and very sad.\u2019 He tried to maintain his calm expression as he gritted out, \u201cI, don\u2019t, believe, Old, Fei, would, dare, laugh, at, you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s speed slowed down as he entered an urban area. Then he sighed and shook his head, \u201cHe did. He said to me, \u201cXi Ze, you unexpectedly didn\u2019t bring toilet paper with you. This joke, I can laugh about it for a year.\u2019 I still remember his words and can recite them.\u201d Xi Ze acted injured while saying this.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>If Old Fei really said this then he was a mushroom!!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t blinded by this man. He made a cold face and his mouth had a hint of a sneer. He said solemnly, \u201cSince you admit that I\u2019m the owner of the house, then Xi Xiaoze, the first rule of the family is: Don\u2019t deceive the owner of the house\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cXi Xiaoze?\u201d (TL: Similar to Ming Yu being called Ming Xiaoyu. Xiao=small/young)</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu glanced at him. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the important point. Today, in this car, the first family rule of this house is born.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze thought for a moment before asking, \u201cYou said that I can\u2019t deceive the owner of the house. Does that mean I can take liberties with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu disagreed. \u201cDefinitely not! ==!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled and didn\u2019t answer. Some things, there was no need to come to a conclusion so quickly. He would count slowly with his small mushroom and slowly convince him.</p><br/><p>In the tranquil dark night, the lights of London were bustling and lively. A red Ferrari quickly passed through the crowd and disappeared into the cool night, not being seen any longer.</p><br/><p>The next day, they were waiting to fly to Milan when Ming Xiaoyu suddenly remembered a crucial question. \u201cDo you have a house in Milan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu nodded before remembering something else. \u201cAre there two bedrooms so I can stay in one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips quietly curved and he stared at the youth for a long time, not saying anything.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable by this. He just asked again, \u201cI don\u2019t need to sleep with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s eyes widened and he looked shocked. \u201cHow could you sleep with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The small mushroom who couldn\u2019t respond for a moment, \u201c\u2026Ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn case you are planning something, rest assured, my bedroom is locked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A bad soul, a bad man!!!</p><br/><p>Even if he regretted it now, the rice had already been cooked. Ming Xiaoyu had to get on a plane with this man and they flew through the clouds for an hour. Then the plane slowly landed at Linate Airport in Milan.</p><br/><p>The two people arrived at noon and hadn\u2019t even made it out of the airport yet when Xi Ze\u2019s phone rang. He picked up the phone and an excited voice was heard, \u201cHey! Xi! Where are you? Did you arrive? Come out here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice was so excited that it broke through the limits of the phone. Even Ming Yu could get a rough idea of the words.</p><br/><p>Do you know what it felt like for two handsome men to suddenly appear at the airport?</p><br/><p>It was a visual feast!</p><br/><p>The shorter man had exquisite facial features and was a very handsome Asian. The man next to him also attracted countless people\u2019s attention. It was because they already discovered that this was Xi Ze!</p><br/><p>Milan, Italy\u2019s second-largest city, was no less famous than the capital of Rome. In this world, one of the four major fashion weeks was held in Milan. The other three were Huaxia, Paris and New York. This city was failed as the \u2018fashion capital\u2019 by the world. Almost all citizens had a keen sense of fashion and knew a lot of news about the industry.</p><br/><p>Models were the darling of the fashion industry.</p><br/><p>And Xi Ze was the world\u2019s first ranked male supermodel!</p><br/><p>Not to mention, he was the designer of the top luxury brand, Ji and Ya!</p><br/><p>For a time, the curious eyes of the airport\u2019s tourists focused on Xi Ze\u2019s body. This also made them notice the young man standing next to Xi Ze. Who was he? He stood with Xi Ze like they were familiar with each other?</p><br/><p>Once the airport calmed down a little bit, Ming Xiaoyu and Xi Ze found the excited man who made the phone call.</p><br/><p>The other party took the initiative to run up and grab Xi Ze\u2019s luggage. Then he observed Ming Xiaoyu with curious eyes before saying happily, \u201cXi, this is your lover? What a beautiful oriental doll!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oriental doll Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026.\u201d It was better if he was called small mushroom.</p><br/><p>To be honest, Ming Yu knew that Xi Ze\u2019s friend was Clucas Vogels the assistant designer of Italy\u2019s top luxury brand Garcia.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu recognized Clucas through his golden hair.</p><br/><p>This Mr. Clucas had a traditional Western face. He was blond, blue-eyed, had deep facial features and was as handsome as a statue. His height was also good, so he had the qualities to be a model.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, when Clucas shook his tail over Xi Ze, Ming Xiaoyu understood why a man in such good condition didn\u2019t want to be a model.</p><br/><p>\u2026His temperament was really not good enough!</p><br/><p>By the time Ming Yu reached the car, he knew that Clucas and Xi Ze were like fellow apprentices of a sect. From another point of view, Clucas worshipped Xi Ze as an idol.</p><br/><p>A long, long time ago, Xi Ze and Clucas studied designing under the same master. Afterwards, whenever the two people participated in a design competition together, Clucas never won once. Sometimes, he couldn\u2019t even get second place. Xi Ze was always safely in the first position.</p><br/><p>If this was the case, shouldn\u2019t he start feeling envy and have nasty thoughts about Xi Ze?</p><br/><p>Absolutely not Clucas!</p><br/><p>Clucas sighed while driving the car. \u201cMing, you know, when I heard my old friend say he had a lover, I really couldn\u2019t believe it! This remarkable person, for one hundred years\u2026no, it would be a rare sight in one thousand years! He actually likes someone? But when I saw you, I understood\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are as outstanding as he is!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thick-skinned Ming Xiaoyu accepted the praise. \u201cThank you for the compliment, Mr. Clucas\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no no no, you must call me Clucas, Ming. I was stunned when I saw you from a distance! You are really worthy of Xi Ze. I\u2019m honoured to invite you to the studio. I\u2019m so happy today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Clucas kept talking excitedly, Ming Yu sighed deeply and whispered in XI Ze\u2019s eyes, \u201cHas Mr. Clucas always been so enthusiastic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked at the youth and gave a low laugh. \u201cHe is always a little warm to me, but not so enthusiastic. Today, I am covered by your light.\u201d</p><br/><p>This type of low-level honeyed words, Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t believe it. The both of them didn\u2019t intend to concede. Ming Xiaoyu wanted to kill this man\u2019s prestige, while Xi Ze wasn\u2019t a gentleman. He simply liked flirting with this small mushroom.</p><br/><p>In the quiet car, Clucas found that no one was replying to his words. He looked at them through the rearview mirror and said emotionally, \u201cTheir feelings are really too good!\u201d</p><br/><p>The black Cadillac drove from Linate Airport for half an hour before parking in front of a two-storey building. The magnificent arched gate was nearly five metres high and immediately attracted Ming Yu\u2019s eyes. Once he looked forward, there were dozens of T-shaped pillars holding the ivory coloured building in place. It was a majestic and extraordinary sight.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had been to many studios of top luxury brands in the past and had seen the creation of high-end clothing. But compared with his previous memories, Garcia had an orderly and harmonious atmosphere. There was a unique vigor in the air that made Ming Yu gradually feel curious.</p><br/><p>It was early in the morning, so Clucas chose to bring Xi Ze and Ming Yu to his own studio to temporarily put down the luggage. As soon as Ming Yu entered the studio, he found several graffiti-like designs on the wall and looked at them with interest.</p><br/><p>Clucas explained with a smile, \u201cThis is something I drew in order to find inspiration. Unfortunately, I failed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu shook his head. \u201cNow, it is drawn very well and is creative.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu spoke the truth. He might not be a designer but he had seen many clothing. Clucas\u2019 designs were slightly rough, but there was a unique style hidden in them that quietly emitted a noble and elegant atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Clucas hurriedly shook his head at these words, \u201cI am far worse than Xi. Oh yes, I\u2019ll show you around Ming.\u201d</p><br/><p>That afternoon, Clucas took Ming Yu and Xi Ze around Garcia\u2019s studio. On the tailor\u2019s work table, there were countless glittering gems as well as gold and silver thread. On the designer\u2019s work table, there was a variety of design manuscript paper and strong coffee.</p><br/><p>It was clearly a few months away from a high-end fashion show. But everyone was clearly guarding their position, striving every minute to design or sew gorgeous clothing.</p><br/><p>Behind every fashion show, there was the sweat and painstaking effort of countless people. Each gemstone had to be sewn on without any difference, while the direction of the brush strokes determined the future of the clothing.</p><br/><p>The trio watched for an afternoon. It was mainly Ming Yu carefully observing while Xi Ze and Clucas accompanied him.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled as he saw the youth\u2019s serious focus. The next time Clucas had an opportunity to chat with Xi Ze, he couldn\u2019t help exclaiming, \u201cXi, it has been so long since I\u2019ve seen you and you\u2019ve become so gentle. I really can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cI am gentle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clucas earnestly nodded. \u201cYes, you have become too gentle\u2026 well, I can\u2019t see it. Anyway, you are very gentle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made an \u201cOh,\u201d sound and didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>The first day of the visit ended Ming Yu\u2019s curiosity. The next day, Xi Ze didn\u2019t take him around. Instead, he was directly lead to a VIP room in Garcia where a beautiful set of clothing could be seen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

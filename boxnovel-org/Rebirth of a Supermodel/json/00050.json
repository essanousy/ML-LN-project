As the winter winds gradually lost their power, the passersby no longer feared for their feet. Even the pale colours in the air were slowly disappearing.</p><br/><p>After nearly a month of busy days, Ming Yu finally managed to complete the shooting for Nidelan, with all the hard photographs and posters being finished.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu spent New Year busy working. Once he turned around, the warm atmosphere of the new year had passed and most people were looking forward to the arrival of the spring festival.</p><br/><p>This time, no matter what Ming Yu said, Zhao Rui hoped that he would give himself a holiday, have a good rest. According to Zhao Rui, \u201cXiaoyu, you have to take a break. You have to take good care of your body and relax, so that you can continue working in a better condition. Besides, the spring festival will be held soon. You missed the new year; shouldn\u2019t you celebrate the spring festival?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was dumbfounded when he heard this. \u201cBrother Zhao, I certainly have to rest for a while. You are saying this like I don\u2019t know how tired I am. I\u2019m not a working machine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui looked surprised. \u201cYou also know that you aren\u2019t a working machine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>By the end of January, the warm winter intensified and the north of the capital became warmer than ever before. It might be a holiday but Ming Yu still had to care about his own fans. Wasn\u2019t it heartless to play around the entire time?</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Chinese New Year was approaching, a group of hungry fans was fed, like rain after a long drought!</p><br/><p>Today, Ming Xiaoyu wrote a sentence on the forum of his official website: \u3010 This morning I ate dumplings, the pine nuts were really fresh! \u3011</p><br/><p>In the evening, Ming Xiaoyu updated his Weibo with a photo and the text: \u3010 It has been a long time since I\u2019ve eaten Luzhu. It tastes great and is especially fresh. \u3011</p><br/><p>At noon the next day, Ming Xiaoyu wrote a long paragraph with the title \u201cToday\u2019s Recipe.\u201d The beginning sentence was: \u3010 Today I started cooking for myself since I should eat well ^\uff3f^ \u3011 The fans saw this and their eyes immediately brightened!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu will cook! He is simply Mr. Perfect! Ming Xiaoyu, do you need a starving dog\uff5e I am 160cm and cute \uff5e\uff5e\uff5e Woof woof\uff5e! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 In life, I see familiar people and often have this feeling: These two people fit together, they are a perfect match. How come they aren\u2019t together despite so many years passing? Like me and Ming Xiaoyu. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 The person above is shameless!! Daring to steal my husband!! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A variety of comments like \u2018Ming Xiaoyu is my perfect man\u2019, \u2018I am Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s lady,\u2019 \u2018Ming Xiaoyu is my husband\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019t steal, I am your mother in law (?)\u2019 appeared under Ming Yu\u2019s post. However, at this moment, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t notice these various responses. He was solemnly using his spatula to turn over the dish in the pan, looking like a kitchen god.</p><br/><p>After 10 minutes, Ming Yu carefully poured the food onto a plate.</p><br/><p>He was done and could share what he cooked with his fans!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu excitedly wrote out his cooking process on the computer and emphasized some points to pay attention to, excitedly writing out thousands of words.</p><br/><p>After Ming Xiaoyu disappeared, the fans had been refreshing an \u2018n\u2019 number of times, letting out a burst of f5 as they waited for Ming Xiaoyu to record the cooking process. A new post finally appeared after refreshing, causing the fans to feel ecstatic\u2014</p><br/><p>Oh god! It had to be at least 1,000 words right? This could be called a long review!!!</p><br/><p>The overjoyed fans \u2018sat on their sofa\u2019 for a \u2018front row view\u2019 and scrolled down with a mighty vigor. The people looking at Ming Yu\u2019s post were shocked as they stared at the first lines\u2014</p><br/><p>Ming Yu: \u3010 Today\u2019s dish is tomato scrambled eggs. This dish is still difficult and takes a bit of effort. There are many areas that you need to pay attention to\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>Still difficult\u2026</p><br/><p>Still difficult\u2026</p><br/><p>Still diffi\u2026</p><br/><p>Still\u2026</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t tomato scrambled eggs the simplest beginner\u2019s dish in the food industry? There was a saying since ancient times that as long as you had both hands, you could make tomato scrambled eggs!</p><br/><p>What was so hard about it?</p><br/><p>This roared in their hearts like 10,000 grass mud horses, but the fans continued to scroll down and read.</p><br/><p>Once they found out that their god was even obsessed with how to carefully peel off the tomato skin, their mouths twitched and they accepted it. But they could no longer bear it when Ming Yu put in the eggs before the oil!!</p><br/><p>In just half an hour, identical replies appeared on Ming Yu\u2019s official Muse website.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu, come to my house, I will feed you Dongpo pork! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu, come to my house, I will feed you Kung Pao chicken! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu, come to my house, I will feed you sweet and sour pork! \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>After another two hours, Ming Yu was searching Weibo when he suddenly found a familiar name in 9th place of the hot topics. Ming Yu looked at it with surprise. The topic name\u2014</p><br/><p>#Feeding Ming Xiaoyu#</p><br/><p>And under that topic\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 Poor Ming Xiaoyu, he still feels good despite eating burnt tomato scrambled eggs\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu must be fed!!! I will cook shrimp, sweet and sour carp, pork chops, pepper fish head, spicy fried clams, pork strips stir fried with yuxiang, mapo tofu, twice-cooked pork, cumin meat slices, vinegar fish\u2026 Ming Xiaoyu, come eat at my home!!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I shouldn\u2019t have come to this topic\u2026 are there really no problems in the late-night topics? \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ming Yu carefully read this topic for a long time. When he exited again, he was surprised to find that this topic actually reached 2nd place! It was second only to the spring festival\u2019s mascot!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help sending a text message to Zhao Rui, asking if this was something that Muse\u2019s PR department did. Zhao Rui sent him a message back after a moment. \u3010 Shen Xiang had nothing to do with it. He wants to suppress your topic. After all, you are now too easy to be targeted by the sunspots. \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was surprised for a moment and replied again, \u3010 Then I am actually ranked 2nd on the hot topics? \u3011</p><br/><p>There was no reply for a long time. Just as Ming Yu thought that Zhao Rui wasn\u2019t going to say anything, he received the slow answer, \u3010 You have to understand that as long as it is related to eating, the people will go crazy. However, Xiaoyu, you don\u2019t have to force yourself. The tomato scrambled eggs\u2026 cough. Don\u2019t eat it, eating instant noodles is also good. \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In his heart, his tomato scrambled eggs were better than instant noodles!!</p><br/><p>In this way, the originally noble God Ming Xiaoyu slowly descended the altar in the fans\u2019 hearts. A lot of fans even added \u2018stupidly adorable\u2019 to the Ming Yu\u2019s name in their hearts.</p><br/><p>But!</p><br/><p>At this historic turning point!</p><br/><p>The new year\u2019s special issue of Meditation Road was finally on sale!</p><br/><p>The comments of \u2018Ming Xiaoyu is really stupid stupid\u2019 and \u2018Ming Xiaoyu is silly and cute\u2019 suddenly changed tones. They shouted in unison, \u201cAhhhh!!! Ming Xiaoyu is too handsome!!! Beautiful beautiful beautiful, I want to lick, lick, lick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meditation Road was the leader of the second-tier fashion magazines in Huaxia and cooperated with Ming Yu four years ago. This was their second time working together. This time, Meditation Road took the initiative to invite Ming Yu as their cover model. It wasn\u2019t commissioned to Muse like last time.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s performance didn\u2019t disappoint Meditation Road.</p><br/><p>On the first day of sales, all 100,000 volumes sold out!</p><br/><p>The next day, more magazines were printed and they were sold out by evening!</p><br/><p>The third day, the fourth day\u2026</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the fifth day that the fans\u2019 buying spree really ended.</p><br/><p>Why were the fans buying so crazily? Some people even bought 2, 3, 4\u2026 56, 57, 58?</p><br/><p>Who told Meditation Road to publish with such a large poster of Ming Yu, or for the poster to be one of five randomly selected photos!</p><br/><p>This damn marketing person! Whose bad idea was it?</p><br/><p>But even though they inwardly cursed the magazine\u2019s marketing demon, the fans who bought the magazine were very excited. They stared at the cover for at least 10 minutes.</p><br/><p>On the glossy magazine cover, a beautiful young boy was slightly bowed, his eyes staring straight up like he was looking at them. He seemed to have just left the water, as his black hair was wet and there were still drops of water on it. Their hair was messy but very beautiful, covering half the forehead.</p><br/><p>You said that the hair was messy?</p><br/><p>A mess!</p><br/><p>But the photo was still beautiful?</p><br/><p>Beautiful!</p><br/><p>The white shirt was wet and almost transparent. Through it, they could see the youth\u2019s extremely beautiful thin layer of muscles, despite still being young. In particular, a fan noticed a small bead of water on the youth\u2019s raised clavicle and everyone could no longer restrain their roaring hearts!</p><br/><p>\u3010 I am that drop of water, I am that drop of water! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s collarbone is so sexy! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 It is a simple wet play! Geez, why is my nose a little hot? What? Blood!!! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The cover of Meditation Road, several photos on the inside pages and the five posters, they could be called the sexiest set of photos taken since Ming Yu\u2019s rebirth. At the time of filming, Ming Yu was bare-faced because even the most waterproof makeup couldn\u2019t endure after being soaked in water.</p><br/><p>But this bare face couldn\u2019t cover up the youth\u2019s beauty!</p><br/><p>Perhaps after another year, Ming Yu wouldn\u2019t be able to shoot such sentimental and mature photos. It was because his facial features would develop and become stereotypical, no longer having the same neutral beauty.</p><br/><p>However, this set of photos allowed many people to suddenly notice this stunning youth. Among them were well-known photographers, fashion designers, wealthy and extravagant luxury brands, as well as directors and producers of TV dramas and movies.</p><br/><p>In the midst of this, a tall and handsome man was standing in the chief designer\u2019s office of \u2018Ji and Ya\u2019, looking down at this sexy and gorgeous photo with slightly narrowed eyes.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t speak for a long time after Ding Bo knocked on the door. Then a low and magnetic voice was suddenly heard, \u201cDing Bo, buy me 50 copies of Meditation Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026Ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised his eyes and indifferently looked over. \u201cNo, buy me 100.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Do you want to buy enough to bathe in?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The traffic of Weibo might\u2019ve reduced in recent years, but in terms of network gathering, Weibo\u2019s major forums were still irresistible.</p><br/><p>Every night, it was time for the night owls to come out.</p><br/><p>Sleeping at 11 p.m.? Come on, the nightlife was just getting started!</p><br/><p>Midnight? Their minds were just getting excited!</p><br/><p>1 a.m.? Wait a minute, I will drowsily browse through the messages\u2026</p><br/><p>In this black life, many people concerned about the fashion industry was refreshing the microblogs, intended to read one last one before sleeping. However, just as they refreshed for the latest hot Weibo topic, a familiar name caught their eyes!</p><br/><p>\u3010 Weibo Hot Search Term No. 15: Fashion Entertainment Typesetting \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026Fashion Entertainment? A famous domestic fashion magazine?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, what was wrong with Fashion Entertainment\u2019s typesetting? They wouldn\u2019t send it to the printing plant if there was trouble!</p><br/><p>Many netizens who didn\u2019t know the truth clicked on it to check, and see the microblog of several big people in the fashion circle. These people were well-known critics, photographers and designers. The thing they were saying now, without any exceptions\u2014</p><br/><p>\u3010 Qi Zhen Sarakly: The theme of this isn\u2019t is very good. I have known Lisa for many years. The collection of youthful clothing she designed gives off the right aura, and her works have been very popular in recent years. But I personally prefer the rebellious feeling from the two-inch photo! Hahaha. As for the typesetting problem\u2026 geez. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Shark Luo Man: This is a disaster for photographers! This is the first time seeing a two-inch photo. The person who did the layout must be drunk. Isn\u2019t the photo wasted because of the magazine! @FashionEntertainment\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Alreat: After this typesetting mistake, I think that @Lisa Fei Sixin won\u2019t want to work with @FashionEntertainment now right? \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The people being vocal were among the best in their fields. Now this group of people were unanimously blaming a second-tier magazine.</p><br/><p>Many unknown netizens came out, stating things like \u2018I\u2019m just minding my own business\u2019 or \u2018who can give me the translation of what is happening?\u2019 This made the topic became more and more popular. It was one in the morning, but it had already climbed to 10th place on the search rankings.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Heart Throbbing Love: I just read about the \u2018typesetting event\u2019 on Weibo. I want to say\u2026 the screen is dirty! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Life of Pleasure: I\u2019ve bought so many issues of Fashion Entertainment and this is the first time I\u2019ve seen this typesetting mistake. The person who designed this page should be fired tomorrow. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zhao Wenjing Isn\u2019t Quiet: That model is really handsome. Does he have a microblog? Pay attention to it! There were too few pictures on Muse\u2019s website! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Eight to Eight: I\u2019m not interested in this incident but he really is handsome! I looked through the magazine and the 2-inch model is more beautiful than most of the other models. His temperament is also better! Typesetting incident +1 \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Such comments endlessly appeared on the Internet, causing talk. The original topic of \u2018Fashion Entertainment\u2019s Typesetting Event\u2019 gradually transformed into \u2018handsome model,\u2019 \u2018Who is he?\u2019, \u2018I want to a microblog of him with beautiful photos\u2019 and so on.</p><br/><p>It was true that the topic shifted, but the centre of the event couldn\u2019t be forgotten.</p><br/><p>By 8 o\u2019clock the next day, it had already risen to 5th on the Weibo search rankings and many media and blogs published about in. Fashion Entertainment finally posted an announcement on their official website and blog, indicating that this typesetting was a mistake. The magazine had made the relevant personnel adjustments so readers, please forgive them.</p><br/><p>At this point, the confusion of a whole night over the typesetting event finally slowly subsided.</p><br/><p>But in this event, the one who undoubtedly gained the most was the \u2018Blue Scarf Handsome Model\u2019 Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>It was only a 2-inch photo, but it was noticed by many people and they even searched for more HD photos. Due to the urgent demands of the readers, Fashion Entertainment released more photos from this issue onto their official website and blog. Of course, HD photos of Ming Yu had to be included.</p><br/><p>Thus, when Ming Yu opened his Weibo that evening, he found that his tens of thousands of fans had shot up to nearly 200,000!</p><br/><p>The number of followers had skyrocketed in just one deal due to this incident. For a young model like MIng Yu, it was simply a pie falling from the sky!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Fashion Entertainment\u2019s typesetting issue actually helped you, MIng Yu. If they had done it normally, you would never be able to get such attention. I heard that in today\u2019s vote for the \u201818-year-old\u2019 section on Fashion Entertainment\u2019s website, you got the first place! Many readers left a message on the official website stating that they only like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu listened to Zhao Rui\u2019s excited voice and smiled. \u201cThis is a good thing.\u201d He didn\u2019t make any other comment. Ming Yu observed Zhao Rui and stated, \u201cBrother Zhao, you also stayed up all night. You should go back and quickly rest, yesterday was really hard on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui waved his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t feel tired. I watched the voices of the navy be pushed down and my heart was pleased. I\u2019ve never worked with the company\u2019s PR department before and after Cheng Su left me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s voice abruptly stopped and he carefully looked at Ming Yu\u2019s face. After confirming that Ming Yu showed no abnormalities, he smiled and changed the topic. \u201cAh Ming Yu, you have the shoot for Character tomorrow, so let me send you home. This time you also worked hard. In fact, you don\u2019t need to stay here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them walked out of the small lounge and headed towards the parking lot. Along the way, Zhao Rui made sure that he didn\u2019t mention \u2018Cheng Su.\u2019 In his mind, Ming Yu had always been soft-hearted, so he would be sad.</p><br/><p>In this regard, Ming Yu was really dumbfounded. Since he came to this world, he hadn\u2019t seen the \u2018big model\u2019\u2026 oh right, he received a phone call but he only heard the man\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Soon, the white business car left Muse and headed west.</p><br/><p>\u2026Then what happened last night?</p><br/><p>In fact, everything was simple. If Zhu Wei\u2019s navy was a small river, then Muse was the Yangtze River.</p><br/><p>As Huaxia\u2019s number one modelling agency, Muse\u2019s resources were abundant and the PR capabilities were also unique. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to describe them as a giant.</p><br/><p>The reason why Muse hadn\u2019t been too concerned with this matter was because they had negotiated with Fashion Entertainment and given Ming Yu a better job. Everything was peaceful, and this event wasn\u2019t at a serious level. Secondly, Ming Yu\u2019s status in the company was really too low. After Zhao Rui referred to him as the \u2018newcomer that the company was optimistic about a few years ago\u2019 and \u2018he appeared on the cover of Meditation Road and in Lanka\u2019, the PR department slightly thought \u2018Who is Ming Yu?\u2019</p><br/><p>A giant company was really hard to manage. Just the PR department of Muse alone had hundreds of employees, but they couldn\u2019t guarantee that every model would be completely observed.</p><br/><p>If Ming Yu hadn\u2019t used his relationships to seek help, this event would\u2019ve probably passed by quietly.</p><br/><p>The small model was able to get a better resource as compensation, so there wouldn\u2019t be any dissatisfaction. After all, any industry would have unspoken rules and all types of grudges suppressed, so this outcome was already considered good.</p><br/><p>However, the target that Fashion Entertainment suppressed was Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>He was the one who used his own strength to overcome countless supermodels in Europe and the United States to reach the pinnacle of the top models. How could he endure such humiliation where there wasn\u2019t even a word of apology?</p><br/><p>He needed to take action to make the other side remember him!</p><br/><p>They wanted to buy a navy? Muse would invite celebrities and even buy a senior navy!</p><br/><p>The industry support, it was a million times better than Zhu Wei\u2019s navy.</p><br/><p>As for Ming Yu, just pushing down Zhu Wei\u2019s navy wasn\u2019t enough. Fashion Entertainment needed to stand up and apologize for trying to suppress him with the typesetting. Therefore, he made Zhao Rui wait until the other side\u2019s navy was running wild and then seriously informed him of what to say to the company.</p><br/><p>There should be no mention of the navy. Just mention \u2018Fashion Entertainment\u2019s pressure!\u2019</p><br/><p>Yes, their position was really low in the company and they weren\u2019t taken seriously. However, they represented Muse wherever they went! They represented the image of Muse Modelling Agency! Now Muse was being bullied by a second-tier magazine, could this really be accepted?</p><br/><p>Today they dare to bully a small model, tomorrow they might dare to oppress Muse\u2019s He Chaoman!</p><br/><p>This would happen if they didn\u2019t take action!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t hear Zhao Rui\u2019s speech in the PR department, but he could imagine that his agent used all his effort to persuade them. As a result, the situation was completely reversed in just one night!</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yu, you didn\u2019t see it but when I finished talking, everyone in the PR department was staring at me. Even the director of the PR department, Shenxiang stared at my stupidly. Later, he secretly told me that he couldn\u2019t believe I had said those words.\u201d Zhao Rui paused before continuing emotionally. \u201cIt is also thanks to your suggestion that I connect Muse and Fashion Entertainment together. Otherwise, those PR people probably wouldn\u2019t have acted so fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and shook his head. \u201cBrother Zhao, I just mentioned it to you. You are the one who gave the speech in the PR department. This is your personal credit, I can\u2019t accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui waved his hand again. \u201cMing Yu, there is no need to be so modest. Today I will take you for a good meal! Why didn\u2019t I notice that you were so smart before? Ming Yu, what have you been eating recently? Tell your Brother Zhao, let me eat it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was so amused by the other person that he couldn\u2019t help laughing. He carelessly blinked and provoked Zhao Rui into calling him shameless.</p><br/><p>Thus, they drove together to a winner\u2019s dinner in order to celebrate. The next morning, Ming Yu arrived at the location of the photo shoot. He was talking to Liu Qiant about things to pay attention to today when a handsome man took the initiative to come over.</p><br/><p>Liu Qian\u2019s voice slowly trailed off. He sneered and snapped out, \u201cWhy are you standing here, did something happen? You are blocking my sunlight. It is annoying so move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the last time Zhu Wei ignored them, Liu Qian didn\u2019t have a good impression of him, despite Ming Yu saying that it was him Zhu Wei despised. Liu Qian\u2019s temper was original prickly and he didn\u2019t want to have a good relationship with Zhu Wei. In addition, he wasn\u2019t afraid of what Zhu Wei could do to him.</p><br/><p>Logically speaking, Zhu Wei should be furious and glare fiercely at Liu Qian.</p><br/><p>However, in the face of Liu Qian who was deliberately making things difficult, Zhu Wei didn\u2019t mind. He smiled, took a few steps to the side and then said, \u201cBrother Liu, I am looking for Ming Yu. I have something to say to him.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Unexpectedly, a certain man took him to a private hospital and had him checked for a long time. He even stressed, \u201cYou must check if there are any problems with the brain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu might\u2019ve blocked the back of his head with his hand and the doctor at H City\u2019s hospital said it was just a slight concussion, but Xi Ze was still uneasy. After repeated confirmations, he was finally willing to believe that it was just a concussion.</p><br/><p>Once they left the hospital, Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t help laughing. He took the man\u2019s right hand with his uninjured left hand and whispered, \u201cXi Ze, I\u2019m really quite moved that you would do this. You are the first person to be so nice to me. I am in a good mood and will allow you to cook a meal for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Xi Ze was listening with great interest as he wondered how the youth intended to repay him. But once he heard the last words, he raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cDid I hear you wrong? You will allow me to cook a meal for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young and handsome man nodded naturally. \u201cYes, don\u2019t be too happy. I haven\u2019t given you an opportunity to show off in a long time. You should take advantage of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made an expression that said \u2018I see what you are trying to pull.\u2019 Ming Xiaoyu saw this and sighed helplessly. \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t know this but my cooking skills greatly improved when I was in H City. It is a pity that one of my hands is hurt or I would cook for you myself. You should cherish the last time you get to show off. After all, it won\u2019t last for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t respond as the two men walked towards the parking lot. Ming Yu pulled open the door with his unharmed left hand and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy is there no reaction to the words I just said?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xi Ze half leaned over and helped Ming Yu fasten his seat belt. Due to his right hand injury, Ming Xiaoyu had to twist his body every time in order to pull the seat belt with his left hand. It was quite laborious to pull the elastic belt over.</p><br/><p>After discovering this point, Xi Ze took over the task of \u2018wearing the seat belt for Small Mushroom.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t immediately respond to Ming XIaoyu\u2019s question. He just calmly buckled the seat belt. The dim light of the sunset shone through the clean glass of the car, highlighting the handsome and deep features. As long as he didn\u2019t speak, he was like a god beloved by others, with an enticing and stunning appearance. But once he raised his head and looked at you, there would be a cold and indifferent noble aura spread out invisibly, producing a feeling of alienation.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze narrowed his eyes and stared closely at the youth. If it was anyone else, such as Ding Bo or Shen Xiang, they would feel creeped out and disturbed. But Ming Xiaoyu still had an indifferent appearance. There was a slight smile on his face and he wasn\u2019t impatient.</p><br/><p>The two of them stared at each other for a long time before Xi Ze finally sighed. \u201cI am in your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words were very soft and Ming Yu didn\u2019t hear them properly. After he asked again, Xi Ze\u2019s lips curved and he ridiculed, \u201cIt is nothing. I was just thinking that I feel like eating braised lion\u2019s head, boiled meat, crystal shrimp and sweet and sour pork.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help crying out, \u201cCan\u2019t you forget these four dishes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze fastened his seat belt for himself and replied, \u201cThey are my small mushroom\u2019s favourite dishes. I don\u2019t dare forget them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a hard day!!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s hand still hadn\u2019t fully recovered and was still a little painful when touched. Thus, that night, Xi Ze didn\u2019t stay in Ming Yu\u2019s home. He helped Ming Yu clean hish and and then returned to his own apartment, telling Ming Yu to call him at any time and he would go downstairs.</p><br/><p>However, once Xi Ze took off the youth\u2019s shirt and saw the large number of bruises on his back, Xi Ze couldn\u2019t help frowning and rubbing the beautiful curves with his fingers silently.</p><br/><p>As a model, Ming Yu\u2019s figure was naturally very good. Xi Ze believed that Ming Yu was his favorite model he had ever seen, male or female.</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s body wasn\u2019t emaciated and had a thin layer of muscles over the lean body due to his insistence on exercising. The white shoulders, narrow waist and raised bones. Xi Ze had seen this beauty countless times and every time it was bright and clean.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, the beautiful back was covered in large bruises.</p><br/><p>Despite using his legs to buffer himself, Ming Yu\u2019s back had surely hit the wall. Otherwise, where else would such a loud banging sound come from? Ming Yu\u2019s back wasn\u2019t swollen but the bruises were very blue and large, causing a shocking sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are making me itchy.\u201d Ming Yu turned and grabbed the man\u2019s hand, saying with a laugh, \u201cMy back isn\u2019t hurt. If you are distressed, shouldn\u2019t you look after my hand? I need to change the dressing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth held out his right hand to Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>His actions were natural without the slightest signs of embarrassment. Xi Ze took Ming Yu\u2019s hand and started to change the bandage.</p><br/><p>It was a good choice to pick Xi Ze. It might just be wrapping a bandage but he did it very beautifully. The medicine was a bit painful because it was necessary to use iodine to clean the wound. However, Xi Ze\u2019s actions were very light and it was already over by the time Ming Yu felt the slight sting.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked at the man\u2019s focused appearance and couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><br/><p>This was the second time today that he had been amazed by this man.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was like the first time the two of them met each other. There was absolutely no love at fight sight. It was a feeling of \u2018this person is perfect.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were always honest with each other and freely admitted, \u2018I first noticed you because of your external appearance, not your internal self.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Yu believed that Xi Ze was the best person he had ever seen in his two lives, in both temperament and appearance. It was the same for Xi Ze. Wasn\u2019t it natural for them to be attracted to each other\u2019s appearance and then their inner selves after they got to know each other better?</p><br/><p>Once Xi Ze finished tying the bandage, Ming Yu gave a low chuckle. \u201cYou are always spoiling me and giving me the illusion that I should feel sorry towards you. But now you are uncharacteristically gentle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cI am gentle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu solemnly nodded. \u201cYes, you are gentle.\u201d It seemed this wasn\u2019t enough as he added, \u201cVery gentle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu originally thought that Xi Ze would be modest and then he would reply, \u201cIt would be good to continue this.\u201d However, XI Ze shook his head and said seriously, \u201cI\u2019m not uncharacteristically gentle. I am always gentle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, this shamelessness ruined the atmosphere!!</p><br/><p>He rested in the capital for two weeks. Maybe it was because the medicine was expensive and the effect was very good. Maybe it was because Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s physical quality was very tough. By the time he officially planned to return to the cast, the bruising on his hand had gradually faded. There was only a faint layer that could be covered with powder. The back of was restored to its original smooth and white appearance, with only the slightest hint of purple.</p><br/><p>Do you think that these two people would be able to quietly restore the injury during these two weeks?</p><br/><p>How could that be?</p><br/><p>The day after returning to the capital, Xi Ze was applying medicine on Ming Yu who took the initiative. Xi Ze had no choice but to respond to the fiery kiss. They kissed and kissed until it was necessary to release the flames. This time, Ming Xiaoyu said very seriously, \u201cThis time I am on top!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze agreed with his mouth but while Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t paying attention, he suddenly fiercely seized the initiative.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu had tears of pleasure and grief as he cried out resentfully, \u201cYou aren\u2019t trustworthy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze spoke sincerely. \u201cYou are hurt. I am doing this so that it isn\u2019t hard for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026How is it hard!!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, he didn\u2019t want to hit his heart and Small Mushroom completely released his anger.</p><br/><p>During Ming Yu\u2019s two weeks of rest, the An Li cast completed all the scenes in H City. Jiang Kaiyang had only entered the cast for a week and hadn\u2019t shot many scenes. He was quickly replaced by a new actor who had a pleasant cooperation with the crew.</p><br/><p>The role of the second male lead wasn\u2019t very difficult to act. If Jiang Kaiyang hadn\u2019t entered through the back door, he might not have received the role.</p><br/><p>Thus, once the crew moved away from H City, Ming Yu also packed his things and intended to fly to Y Province to join the crew. This time, a certain man was very careful while Ming Yu was packing.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry as he said, \u201cI am going to shoot a movie. What are you doing with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze replied calmly. \u201cI will go with you and watch in order to cheer you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he be so calm and free with his recent Ji and Ya work?</p><br/><p>This guy so easily abandoned the industry. How could he remain the world\u2019s top supermodel without being pulled down from his position? There was really no justice in this world!</p><br/><p>Regardless of how speechless Ming Xiaoyu was, Xi Ze eventually followed his husband\u2026cough, it was the principle of \u2018Mushroom sings, I will follow.\u2019 Thus, he went to Ming Xiaoyu to Y Province where the next An Li scenes would be filmed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

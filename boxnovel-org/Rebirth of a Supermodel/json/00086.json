He had been specifically invited by Nidelan to shoot this ad and wasn\u2019t familiar with other people in the crew. It seemed that there was a small disagreement that was now being negotated.</p><br/><p>Xu Yizong\u2019s name was naturally known by Ming Yu. He was a big director who often filmed commercial blockbusters. The highest grossing commercial action movie at the Huaxia box office last year was his work. Nidelan must\u2019ve gone through a great deal of effort and money to get Xu Yizong to shoot this ad. In addition, it was normal for a big director to be harsh and demanding, with a temper that wasn\u2019t necessarily good.</p><br/><p>As Ming Yu approached the director and camera team, he heard the argument from far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut all eight cameras in place. Don\u2019t dawdle, ok? We are going to shoot an advertisement for first-tier luxury goods, not a small drink. Don\u2019t be afraid of saving money on multi-angle shots. What we want is the effect. I am the director. Listen to me, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Director Xu, the machines that you requested are all imported from abroad and don\u2019t use electronic chips. They use film! It is too much to use this. If there are several NGs then it will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the director or am I the director?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Director Xu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Ming Yu had seen someone daring enough to go against a director on set, especially since Xu Yizong was a famous Huaxia director. Once Ming Yu approached, he discovered that the person arguing with Xu Yizong was actually someone he knew. Tan Jingming who was in charge of the camera group when shooting the Shuyue Lemonade ads.</p><br/><p>Tan Jingming was still trying to advise Director Xu. \u201cDirector Xu, how about we shoot with four cameras and then take a second shot? It will turn out well with post-editing. The effect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Xu waved his hand impatiently and told Tan Jingming. \u201cIn this crew, what I say is what will happen. Tan Xiaozi, if it wasn\u2019t for your mother\u2019s sake, I would\u2019ve kicked you out of the crew right now!\u201d (Xiaozi= youngster/young fellow)</p><br/><p>Tan Jingming\u2019s face turned green at the words and he bit his lip, not speaking anymore.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu frowned at the sight. Then Luo Ru came over and whispered in Ming Yu\u2019s ears, \u201cI just found out when talking to the crew. Xiaotan who filmed the ad with us last time is also here. The director wanted to shoot with eight cameras at the same time, but Xiaotan didn\u2019t agree with him. He is in charge of the camera team and Director Xu wanted to shoot with film, where the exposure is larger. If there ares several NGs, the camera will become a bit depleted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had already heard these things and was curious about another issue.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Luo, who is Brother Tan\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru sighed and said, \u201cPreviously, Xiaotan was very low-key when shooting the Shuyue Lemonade ads so I didn\u2019t know. Today, I just checked his information. His mother is Tan Yunqing. Xiaotan takes his mother\u2019s surname and is from a single parent family. The reason why Xiaotan was able to take charge of this Nidelan advertisement shooting is also because his mother wanted him to learn. She helped him by arranging this opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s eyes narrowed at the words and he shifted his gaze to the chagrined Tan Jingming.</p><br/><p>Tan Yunqing was the most famous female photographer in Huaxia. Her status in the industry was equivalent to Old Fei. In the international community, her popularity was even higher.</p><br/><p>Tan Yunqing was famous from early on. When she was a teenager, she won first place in a world-class photography contest. Afterwards, she kept winning awards year after year. She had outstanding achievements in both commercial photography and art photography.</p><br/><p>Old Fei was comparable to Tan Yunqing in commercial photography, but he was far worst when it came to humanist photography. It should be noted that Tan Yunqing had won first place in the Sony Photography Contest in Japan. The one who motivated all female photographers in Huaxia and was their idol was Tan Yunqing.</p><br/><p>It was natural that Tan Yunqing could arrange to have her son enter the Nidelan crew. The last time Ming Yu filmed the Shuyue Lemonade ads, he had contact with Tan Jingming. In Ming Yu\u2019s mind, Tan Jingming had some strengths. However, he didn\u2019t have tact with people and needed to hone his temper.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought about this as he approached Tan Jingming with a smile. \u201cBrother Tan, long time no see. I didn\u2019t expect to work with you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Jingming wasn\u2019t surprised to see Ming Yu. He just nodded stiffly and said, \u201cLong time no see, Ming Xiaoyu.\u201d</p><br/><p>His appearance made Ming Yu confused. Tan Jingming wasn\u2019t an easily irritated person and his relationship with Tan Jingming was fairly good. Why did he have this attitude?</p><br/><p>After speaking a few more words, Tan Jingming said something that made Ming Xiaoyu stunned. His mouth twitched and he didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Xiaoyu, Director Xu knows your acting level and that you will NG many times. How can he be so wasteful? I think that eight cameras are too many and aren\u2019t necessary. However, Director Xu is used to big commercial movies and doesn\u2019t care about money!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Speak clearly, what level was he?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that he didn\u2019t care about money and asked for good machines. This is Sony\u2019s latest product that was only launched at the beginning of this year. I have one at home and my mother won\u2019t even let me touch it! As soon as I thought about Director Xu spoiling them on you, I couldn\u2019t bear it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would spoil them?</p><br/><p>\u201cI had to speak, even at the risk of making Director Xu angrier. Nidelan isn\u2019t lacking money, but I love cameras! This time, the director asked for such a large exposure request. If you NG 10 or 20 times, there will be too much damage to the ccd and I can\u2019t bear it!\u201d (TL: CCD= an electronic light sensor used in various devices including digital cameras)</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Haha\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way Ming Xiaoyu, why aren\u2019t you talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t want to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Xiaoyu? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What did you say? You would be angry if you heard the same words! ?\uff3f?</p><br/><p>Why did Ming Xiaoyu say just now? Tan Jingming really didn\u2019t have any tact with people!</p><br/><p>This was why Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t argue with him. He knew that Tan Jingming wasn\u2019t malicious and was only speaking the words from his heart. If this happened to other people with relatively small eyes, Tan Jingming could suffer a big loss. If he kept acting like this and making the relationship between him and Director Xu worse, it was likely that Tan Jingming would be directly driven out of the crew!</p><br/><p>However, Ming Yu also knew that Tan Jingming really liked photography and sincerely cared for the cameras. After pondering it for a moment, his heart became less comfortable and he asked, \u201cBrother Tan, are you so sure that I will NG?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Jingming nodded instantly. \u201cOf course, you will NG. It won\u2019t be normal if you don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>I will turn and report you to Director Xu!</p><br/><p>In any case, Director Xu pressed down Tan Jingming\u2019s nonsense using his own powerful means. Tan Jingming directed the work of the other people in the camera team while preparing to steer the No. 1 camera.</p><br/><p>It was a long shot.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu would enter the cocktail party, meet with the blonde, communicate and finally steal the fragrance.</p><br/><p>The high-end banquet hall was full of beautiful men and women dressed in bright colours, who were buzzing and laughing. The hall was gorgeous from the luxurious decorations, luring every person who walked in.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu entered the room at this time.</p><br/><p>From the moment he walked in, eight cameras aligned to his position from different angles. First, the hand that pushed the door was slender and distinct. It seemed like a random action that pushed open the door, but it was slow and sensuous.</p><br/><p>After waiting for Ming Yu to actually enter the camera, Tan Mingjing froze for a moment and quickly moved the No. 1 camera, almost making a mistake.</p><br/><p>The youth was wearing black clothes and the texture of the clothing could be seen. His hair was sprayed back from his face, exposing the handsome face to the public. It was accompanied by a noble and elegant temperament.</p><br/><p>After entering the banquet hall, all the people inside couldn\u2019t help looking at him.</p><br/><p>The noble and glamourous gentleman\u2019s lips slightly curved up and his eyes glanced indifferently at the audience before he headed towards a certain direction. He wasn\u2019t walking on a catwalk but his posture was very good, as if he was a king on the red carpet. His every step was calm and quiet.</p><br/><p>The blonde female invited to play against Ming Yu was a famous French model. She was tall with fine facial features and beautifully coloured eyes. Usually, everyone\u2019s hearts couldn\u2019t help thinking of an \u2018angel\u2019 when seeing this female model</p><br/><p>However, this time nobody paid attention to this \u2018angel.\u2019</p><br/><p>The eyes of the extras couldn\u2019t help falling on Ming Yu as he stepped closer to the blonde. At the same time, the latter raised her head slightly and looked at the youth in front of her with a provocative and enchanting gaze.</p><br/><p>The female model wore 8cm high heels, making her much taller. It could be said that the female model\u2019s height was equal to Ming Yu. However, at the same time, a woman would look taller than a man. Therefore, they would be more imposing with the height advantage.</p><br/><p>This time, to everyone\u2019s surprise, they didn\u2019t think this woman was imposing at all!</p><br/><p>On the contrary, the original noble and beautiful female model seemed to become a woman in love in front of the young man. Her clear eyes looked up at Ming Yu like she fell in love at first sight. A beautiful and romantic atmosphere spread.</p><br/><p>Tan Jingming felt sluggish as he looked at this scene through the camera.</p><br/><p>When had Ming Yu\u2019s acting become so good?</p><br/><p>In fact, there was one thing that Tan Jingming never noticed. This time, Ming Yu wasn\u2019t deliberately acting as another person. He was himself, the person he was acting was himself.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s temperament and demeanor would never let any photographer down.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

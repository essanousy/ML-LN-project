For example, Ji and Ya had a high-end show with the theme of Dragons and Phoenixes.</p><br/><p>But even Ji and Ya couldn\u2019t compare to Yizhi this time. The stage music, music selection and the blending of ancient Huaxia style with modern fashion style combined to create such a novel fashion show.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was only part of the Yizhi fashion show. The outfit design of Yizhi could be regarded as an average level. Compared to Ji and Ya, it was one stage worse.</p><br/><p>However, after the fashion show ended, Ji and Ya\u2019s chief designer Xi Ze was interviewed by reporters and he said, \u201cThis 5,000 Years fashion show. The inspiration is very good and has placed pressure on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, countless newspapers and magazines reported on this fashion show.</p><br/><p>[5,000 years of ancient scenery, the years of culture accumulating in this fashion show!] [Green Bamboo Dragon Shadow: Yizhi\u2019s high-end show garnered global applause.]</p><br/><p>[Yizhi\u2019s chief designer Liu Zhenqi: We just wanted to use the Huaxia style to describe fashion]\u2026.</p><br/><p>Yizhi\u2019s high-end show really was a show. The overall level of fashion wasn\u2019t as high as Ji and Ya\u2019s last women\u2019s high-end show. However, the new ideas caught the attention of many people outside the industry, attracting passersby.</p><br/><p>Three days after the fashion show, a new issue of Muse was released worldwide.</p><br/><p>The cover contained Du Ruo\u2019s sexy photo while the inside page was actually Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>The two people were wearing the same white shirt style. Du Ruo seemed to only be wearing a thin white shirt. The sun shone on it and it was sexy enough to cause nosebleeds.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu gave off a gentle and kind temperament when wearing the white shirt. When this youth leaned against the wall and smiled at then, they could feel the golden sunshine gently dance in his slightly curly hair. His skin was white and transparent, while his eyes were clear like amber.</p><br/><p>The huge difference between the outer cover and inner page made it easy to remember these two outstanding supermodels. In addition, the poster attached to Muse magazine was quite strange. The big poster was a group shot of Du Ruo and Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>In the past, the magazine attached poster would be a single photo of the cover character. This time, the photo had two people!</p><br/><p>In the poster, Du Ruo sat on a deep red sofa with her legs crossed, the white long legs and red fabric forming a sharp contrast. The plump red lips were curved in a smile and the sexy and enchanting beauty handed a small green jewel to the youth standing to the side.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu solemnly took the jade with both hands, the two people staring at each other.</p><br/><p>This poster was beautiful enough with just Du Ruo!</p><br/><p>Now with Ming Yu, it made fans all over the world go crazy!</p><br/><p>Even the He Chaoman fans, who always argued with Du Ruo fans, had to admit: \u3010 These two taking a photo together, it is really beautiful\u2026 eh? I bought this issue of Muse? What? I actually bought two issues! QAQ Manman, quickly appear in a magazine and save us!!! \u3011 He Chaoman who was playing games at home, \u201cAchoo! Who is talking about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>But when this issue of Muse appeared, many people looked at the poster of Ming Yu and Du Ruo and felt something strange. After they read the relevant reports related to Du Ruo and Ming Yu, some of the more sensitive people smelt something wrong.</p><br/><p>Du Ruo\u2019s contract as the global spokesperson of Yizhi is about to expire. This time Ming Yu was suddenly invited to Yizhi\u2019s show as the opening model. This article on the Yizhi fashion show was actually written by Song Chuci, chief editor of Muse, and in the poster, Du Ruo is handing a piece of jade to Ming Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What a surprise!</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t right!!</p><br/><p>For a time, many of the media outlets and netizens exploded. They started to discuss if the meaning of Muse\u2019s double poster was inadvertent or if it was intentional?</p><br/><p>As these fans and media were talking in full swing, a handsome and relaxed youth was sitting on a wide mahogany in a private work room on the top floor of the Muse building and looking at the situation with interest. He flipped through a thick magazine while looking at his phone from time to time.</p><br/><p>Few people dared to touch Xi Ze\u2019s desk.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s sense of cleanliness was such that he didn\u2019t have any contact with people he was only a little familiar with. If a person dared touch his personal belongings without his permission, as long as their relationship with Xi Ze was good, he might use his poisonous tongue to let them eat a bit of pain. But if the person wasn\u2019t related to him, he wouldn\u2019t attack but he would never bother seeing that person again.</p><br/><p>Of course, the category of things classified as personal items was still relatively small.</p><br/><p>However, this work table was definitely one of them!</p><br/><p>As a designer, there were countless valuable design drawings on this table as well as some expensive pen and ruler tools. Don\u2019t touch the table. If a person touched the table then they would receive the man\u2019s cold eyes.</p><br/><p>Now there was a youth sitting on the table without a care, chuckling from time to time. Beside him, the handsome and elegant man wasn\u2019t angry. Instead, he continued to work from calmly. Occasionally he would use his favourite pen to poke the youth\u2019s waist, teasing him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it! Aren\u2019t you busy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu lightly reprimanded. Xi Ze made a dark expression and had to hold back his salty pig hand.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was looking at the Muse magazine while also helplessly looking at the netizens\u2019 speculations. Finally, he turned to look at Xi Ze and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know, these fans are really\u2026 what are you so angry about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips slightly thinned and he raised an eyebrow. \u201cI am angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, Ming Xiaoyu thought carefully and understood what was going on. Ming Yu was very happy when he saw that Xi Ze was jealous. He put the magazine down and suddenly put his leg down from the table. When Xi Ze still hadn\u2019t replied, Ming Xiaoyu sat in his lap.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was slightly stunned and subconsciously held the youth\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. If you are angry then I will have to hit you. I have been watching the fan reactions to Muse. They seem to have completely forgotten that this article also talks about Luo Cheng. They are guessing about the poster containing Du Ruo and I.</p><br/><p>An old saying was the most appropriate way to describe Xi Ze\u2019s mood at the present.</p><br/><p>\u300e Soft fragrant jade in my arms \u300f</p><br/><p>Look at this sweet and soft Ming Xiaoyu sitting in Mr. Xi\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s mood was suddenly very good. \u201cSong Chuci thought well this time. With this issue, Muse\u2019s sales will reach a peak tomorrow and might even break the global sales record. But since he treats you and Du Ruo as the highlight of this issue and regards Luo Cheng as a foil, he might eat some bitterness when he goes home at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu wasn\u2019t stupid. Once he heard this, he was slightly startled before understanding. \u201cEditor Song and Luo Cheng are in that type of relationship?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze gentle hummed.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu recalled the scene where he met with Luo Cheng in Muse Magazine. What was Ming Xiaoyu thinking? He thought that he was stupid and he never expected that husky and the cold Editor Song to have this type of unclear relationship.</p><br/><p>But the two people didn\u2019t stay on this topic for long. In order to appease the angry man, Ming Yu had suddenly sat on the other\u2019s lap. But his posture was too wonderful. He was just sitting on a certain part and gradually felt that thing about to wake up.</p><br/><p>They were still in the company. Therefore, Ming Yu coughed and planned to stand up quickly. But how could Xi Ze let him. He gently rubbed against the youth\u2019s body while smiling, \u201cDon\u2019t move and let me hug you. I will slowly make it subside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s cheeks were red with embarrassment. He had never done such a thing with this man in this office, nor did he intend to. However, Ming Xiaoyu could only remain half stiff as he let Xi Ze rub himself against him. This counted as venting.</p><br/><p>This ambiguous atmosphere became thicker and gradually, even Ming Yu felt a bit hot. He lowered his head to look at the man sitting below him. It just happened that his gaze met a pair of dark eyes.</p><br/><p>The two men looked at each other for a moment before suddenly kissing in a tacit manner.</p><br/><p>The bites and licks caused a beautiful breath to spread out. Ambiguous sounds filled the gentle studio as Xi Ze\u2019s hands hugged the youth\u2019s waist and Ming Yu was directly holding Xi Ze\u2019s neck, forcing the kiss.</p><br/><p>After feeling that the thing underneath him had completely awakened, Ming Xiaoyu no longer wanted to think. He let the other side continue to move while at the same time, he actively exchanged saliva with the man.</p><br/><p>Red cheeks and heavy breathing. When the two people\u2019s lips separated, Ming Yu\u2019s eyes were surprisingly bright and he felt some familiar feelings.</p><br/><p>The second kiss was almost inseparable. Therefore, the two people didn\u2019t hear someone knocking on the door. It was only when the door was pushed open that Ming Xiaoyu subconsciously pushed away Xi Ze. At the same time, he bent down and hid under the table.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The ignorant Ding Bo, \u201cXi Ze, I just knocked on your door. Why didn\u2019t you hear it? What? Your face is a bit red. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze tried to suppress his lust as much as possible and raised his eyes, calmly saying, \u201cNothing\u2026 What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo didn\u2019t think too much. He just looked at the man with suspicious eyes before saying, \u201cWell, I bought 1,000 copies of this magazine\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing Bo!\u201d Xi Ze suddenly interrupted the other person\u2019s words. Ding Bo made a strange expression while Xi Ze gritted his teeth and said, \u201cI am not feeling well right now. Wait for half an hour and come in again.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was startled. \u201cHalf an hour?\u2019</p><br/><p>A moment later, Xi Ze\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cOne hour later, come again!</p><br/><p>The confused Ding Bo turned to leave and whispered at the door. \u201cWhat is the matter? You were the one who told me to buy the magazines for you. I quit! \u2570\uff08\u2035\u2032\uff09\u256f !!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Early in the last century, Huaxia produced several world-class superstars and at the same time, the fashion industry enjoyed rapid development. The emergence of major magazines, fashions shows and international big names in the second half of the last century allowed Huaxia to become a leader of the fashion industry.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu arrived at Fashion Entertainment\u2019s studio early and had been psychologically prepared. It was a second-tier magazine, with many top magazines above it. However, the strength of Huaxia in this world meant that second-tier magazines were just as good as first-tier magazines in his last life.</p><br/><p>But despite this, Ming Yu was still startled when he entered the wide and spacious studio.</p><br/><p>\u2026Was this really the studio of a second-tired Huaxia magazine?</p><br/><p>After glancing at the large number of people in the huge studio, Ming Yu turned to looked at his agent and asked. \u201cBrother Zhao, the models taking photos today\u2026 there seems to be a lot of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the row of dressing rooms. There were a few with closed doors, but those with the open doors contained four or five models. In addition, there were three photography booths set up in the studio at the same time. Ming Yu estimated that there were at least 30 models waiting here.</p><br/><p>It was natural to enjoy the visuals of a group of tall, handsome and charming models. However, did a second-tier magazine really need so many models? And this was just today\u2019s shooting schedule!</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui listened to Ming Yu\u2019s question and let out an embarrassed smile. Then he said, \u201cWe are shooting a few pages on the current trend of clothing, which is a main section of Fashion Entertainment. In general\u2026 there will be a lot of models.\u201d And you aren\u2019t a famous model.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui didn\u2019t say those words, but Ming Yu inwardly sighed because he understood.</p><br/><p>When he was studying Fashion Entertainment last night, he noticed that the six pages in the middle would introduce the trends of the seasons. For example, the Fashion Entertainment magazine he read yesterday talked about the \u2018Central European style.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if Ming Yu wasn\u2019t entirely satisfied with the status of the original owner, he never expected the original owner to be reduced to the status of a second-tier magazine\u2019s clothing model.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu saw Zhao Rui\u2019s bleak and helpless look, and comforted him with a smile. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter Brother Zhao. We just have to start from scratch. Having Fashion Entertainment as a starting point is high enough.\u201d The youth patted Zhao Rui\u2019s shoulder gently as he spoke.</p><br/><p>The gentle smile and tone of the handsome youth caused a lot of shock to his agent. Zhao Rui stared at Ming Yu for a long time, until a make-up artist\u2019s assistant approached and asked, \u201cMing Yu? We are ready to do your makeup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he reacted. He watched as the small model calmly and politely responded to the assistant and followed the other person to the dressing room. Zhao Ruis\u2019s eyes shook while he inwardly grieved. He had been with this kid for three years. Where had the kid learned to act like this?</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was lamenting when make-up was applied to Ming Yu, amplifying his beauty by 100 times!</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yu, your skin is so good. What skin care products do you usually use?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is probably because I am still young. But Sister Lin, your skin isn\u2019t bad. Are you\u202625 years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, what nonsense are you speaking. I am 35 years old!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How long had he known Little Yu? Say it! Where did you learn how to tease older women!!</p><br/><p>The make-up artist finished Ming Yu\u2019s make-up while Zhao Rui was feeling indignation. Today\u2019s magazine shoot was too much. Many young models were huddled in Ming Yu\u2019s make-up room.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui never knew that his young model had such a good mouth!</p><br/><p>To the left person, \u201cAre you also from Beijing?\u201d To the right, \u201cI\u2019ve seen you before in magazines.\u201d He coaxed the young and beautiful females (the oldest was 21) until they were calling him \u2018Little Brother Yu\u2019 and \u2018Little Yu.\u2019 Zhao Rui was surprised at the sight.</p><br/><p>He remembered\u2026 the previous times when he took Ming Yu to magazines, he would call them \u2018auntie,\u2019 causing the photographers to become angry. Then what was happening today?</p><br/><p>Of course, Ming Yu\u2019s current attitude couldn\u2019t be criticized.</p><br/><p>Fashion Entertainment\u2019s dressing room could accommodate four or five people at the same time, but there were only two make-up artists. Therefore, Sister Lin was putting the final touches on Ming Yu\u2019s make-up when a sneering voice was heard from the side. \u201cSister Lin, my eyebrows are a bit unfinished. Can you help me fill them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The strangely cold tone, as if it was pulled through the teeth, caused Ming Yu to slightly frown.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked in the mirror and saw a handsome and tall model standing to his side. The model didn\u2019t wait for Ming Yu to speak as he laughed. \u201cMing Yu, long time no see. In the past six months, you seem to have changed a lot. Your face is more refined.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the end of his words, the model deliberately lengthened the tone, giving Ming Yu\u2019s body a meaningful sweep. Needless to say, the other people present understood. He was implying that Ming Yu got plastic surgery!</p><br/><p>Apart from the face, the fashion industry also looked at the temperament and body. However, the words \u2018plastic surgery\u2019 still upset some people.</p><br/><p>The young man frowned slightly as he listened to the model\u2019s words. He carefully looked through his memories before saying with a light smile. \u201cMy make-up is almost done. Sorry for the trouble, but can you wait a while? Sister Lin will be able to help with your make-up soon.\u201d His tone wasn\u2019t overbearing, angry or full of flattery.</p><br/><p>The model saw that Ming Yu had the \u2018taking the initiative to forgive\u2019 attitude and hummed coldly. He planned to leave but everyone didn\u2019t expect the handsome youth to curve his lips and asked, \u201cRight, I don\u2019t know your name. Six months have passed and your change is really big. I don\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Lin, \u201cPfft!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201cPfft. Cough cough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing people on the side: o\uff08*\u2267\u25bd\u2266\uff09\u30c4\u250f\u2501\u2513\uff01</p><br/><p>The handsome male mode;, \u201c\u201d@#\uff05@\uff05@!\u201d</p><br/><p>The angry looked male model stared at Ming Yu in the mirror and gnashed his teeth, as if he wanted to kill the other person with his eyes. But he saw Ming Yu smiling at him innocently, causing the extremely angry male model to laugh and say, \u201cYou better remember your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the model left the dressing room, everyone could no longer hold back their laughter. Sister Lin put down the make-up she was holding and helpless asked, \u201cLittle Yu, you really caused too much damage. How did you know that Zhu Wei got plastic surgery? His fine-tuning was very clever. I wouldn\u2019t have known if I hadn\u2019t applied make-up on him earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, who had already seen the other person\u2019s face-lift, pretended to be surprised. \u201cHe really got plastic surgery? Sister Lin, I was just guessing. I didn\u2019t expect my guess would be right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Lin laughed as she listened to these words. But after she completed Ming Yu\u2019s makeup, she worriedly said, \u201cBut Little Yu, Zhu Wei is an extremely petty person. I recently heard that he is mixed up with the deputy editor of Fashion Entertainment. It is disgusting, but he can borrow power to do wicked things. So, you should be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled indifferently. \u201cThank you for your concern, Sister Lin. I will pay attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people laughed and joked around, while Zhao Rui helpless watched Ming Yu and his \u2018harem.\u2019 The group of beauties teased Little Yu with a cheerful expression, before Ming Yu finally left the dressing room to pick his clothing.</p><br/><p>There were many amazed eyes on them as they walked. Zhao Rui couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and he asked, \u201cMing Yu, how did your mouth become so sweet today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu raised his eyebrows with surprise. \u201cBrother Zhao, I am just telling the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had a conscience, say it again!</p><br/><p>Once Zhao Rui went to find someone to ask about the clothing, Ming Yu stood alone in the photography area and looked indifferently at the models taking photos.</p><br/><p>Such a handsome young boy naturally attracted many people\u2019s attention. They approached Ming Yu, who responded politely and won a lot of goodwill.</p><br/><p>Why was his mouth so sweet?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had fought alone in the fashion industry for the last 12 years, so he was no longer a reckless young model. If he wanted to mix in such complex circles without a background to rely on, he could only endure, endure and endure as he climbed step by step.</p><br/><p>Of course, this type of patience didn\u2019t mean he could tolerate confrontations or provocations like Zhu Wei\u2019s. If he endured too much, it gave people the impression that \u2018he is easily bullied\u2019, making his development more unfavourable.</p><br/><p>Therefore, a kind but not too flattering, distant but not too apathetic attitude was the right way to walk in these circles.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought for a long time as he waited for Zhao Rui. When he saw the other person, he originally wanted to ask why Zhao Rui took so long. However, he swallowed down his words when he saw the clothes Zhao Rui was holding.</p><br/><p>The tall and handsome youth smiled faintly and gently asked, \u201cBrother Zhao, I\u2026 was there a change of clothes?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

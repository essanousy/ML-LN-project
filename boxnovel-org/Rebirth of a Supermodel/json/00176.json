The unpleasant smell of smoke made the only lady in the area\u2014Luo Ru frowned but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>The remark was so loud that even if Ming Yu wanted to pretend not to hear, it was impossible.</p><br/><p>Compared with this morning\u2019s blatant arrogance, Andrew no longer concealed his nature. His contemptuous eyes swept over Ming Yu and Luo Ru before he sneered. \u201cThe thing with the old Oliver just now, I gave you a bit of face. Don\u2019t take yourself seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words didn\u2019t make Ming Yu angry. He kept looking at Andrew with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing it, Andrew thought that the Huaxia model was afraid of him. He taunted, \u201cI used to compare you and me. Before I saw you at the RAmer Charity Gala, I thought you were a character. But in this case, Mudley was a sensible person who knew who to choose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cYou were the one who took the initiative to call Mudley over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew laughed. \u201cWhat? No.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and shook his head. \u201cOf course.\u201d His tone was dignified without any rage.</p><br/><p>The youth was indifferent but in Andrew\u2019s eyes, he thought this small model should be afraid of him. Andrew disliked it. \u201cYou Huaxia people always have a disgusting self-confidence. Do you think that you can win against me with Oliver on your side? I am the sky in the European and American fashion industry! But I am an adult. If you apologize to me today then I will spare you. I won\u2019t make trouble for you in this Ruth Mary high-end show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew felt that he was very good as he said these words. \u201cOnce this fashion show ends, you should remember not to appear in my fashion shows again. I can\u2019t stand you self-righteous Huaxia people!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words made Luo Ru grit her teeth with disgust. However, Ming Yu didn\u2019t move so she naturally couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>In fact, Luo Ru didn\u2019t understand why Xiaoyu was modestly enduring this Andrew. Andrew might have the top fashion brand Karma behind him. However, Luo Ru knew that the entire Ji and Ya was standing behind Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Karma was indeed a world famous luxury brand that was no worse than Ruth Mary. But it wasn\u2019t on the same level as Ji and Ya! Karma couldn\u2019t even be compared to Rosalind. How could it compete with Ji and Ya?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and asked, \u201cMr., Andrew, I don\u2019t know how I provoked you that you would talk to me like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because Andrew\u2019s mood was better. He replied, \u201cProvoke me? You are a Huaxia person, yet you dared join the world\u2019s supermodels list at the same time as me. This is where you offended me! The thought of my name being linked with yours from now on is disgusting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he heard these words, the youth said very seriously, \u201cMr. Andrew, please don\u2019t insult my homeland. It is my home, the place where I was raised all my life. Huaxia has a vast land, is economically powerful and the people are very friendly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! You dare call that broken place a big land? You Huaxia people are disgusting! Yellow and black people shouldn\u2019t exist in this world! Do you know what is flowing in your blood? It is dirty blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s eyes became red as he heard this and he cried out angrily, \u201cMr. Andrew, please apologize to my homeland! I have never offended you but you have repeatedly humiliated my country. You are really too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh, I will never set foot on your dirty land in my life, Ming Yu! You didn\u2019t listen to me and now I am in a bad mood! Even if you apologize to me, I won\u2019t accept it! If you keep apologizing to me every time you see me again, I will allow you to continue in the high-end fashion show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Andrew, you are a bit out of line.\u201d Mr. Will, who hadn\u2019t wanted to get involved, finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. \u201cRuth Mary has signed a contract with Mr. Ming. I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t stop Mr. Ming from taking part in the fashion show.</p><br/><p>Andrew Wallen really had a strong background but this method of bullying a model was too much. Don\u2019t talk about the party involved, even Mr. Will felt angry and sorry for Ming Yu. But he was only a small staff member and didn\u2019t dare to confront Andrew. He could only say these sentences.</p><br/><p>Andrew glanced at Mr. Will and sneered. \u201cWho are you? I\u2019m telling you, the chief designer and chairman of Ruth Mary\u2019s board is friends with my mother! He is my uncle and grew up watching me. If I want to get rid of Ming Yu then I can definitely do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew gave his agent a look and ordered, \u201cCall Uncle Leo. Tell him that someone is bullying me. Huhu, they dared to challenge the European and American fashion industries. They are really tired of living!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mr. Will\u2019s eyes were red. \u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s eyes flashed when he saw that Andrew\u2019s agent was really making a call. He said, \u201cAndrew, do you really think you are the sky in Europe and America? This world is about the law and your behavior\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you are speaking to me about the law? In Europe and the United States\u2019 fashion industry, I am the law!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he saw this, Luo Ru was so angry she couldn\u2019t hold back. Luo Ru had never seen such an arrogant second generation person in Huaxia! This was simply too mad, a local tyrant!</p><br/><p>Even Jiang Kaiyang, who had a bad relationship with Ming Yu, just waged a cold war against Ming Yu. He didn\u2019t go straight to using such means to resolve things!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this too simple and rude?</p><br/><p>Did Andrew have a brain?</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t he have offended many people?</p><br/><p>Luo Ru didn\u2019t know that Andrew\u2019s words weren\u2019t really arrogant. In the entre European and American fashion industries, there were few people willing to provoke Andrew Wallen.</p><br/><p>As the second largest luxury brand in the US, Karma enjoyed a high reputation worldly. Karma might only be ranked fifth or sixth in the world but it was only worse than the top four high-end brands. Compared to other luxury brands around the world, Karma was definitely at the forefront.</p><br/><p>Huaxia\u2019s Ji and Ya, the United State\u2019s Rosalind, Italy\u2019s Garcia and France\u2019s Otilla. These four top luxury brands have always been relatively low-key and most of the people they serve were in the upper classes. Raymond, the chief designer of Rosalind, might\u2019ve once arrogantly bullied Xi Ze but he was an honest person.</p><br/><p>If Karma wasn\u2019t a top brand in the fashion world then Andrew wouldn\u2019t count as a second generation.</p><br/><p>For the moment, let\u2019s not mention if the world-class fashion godfather Xi Ze ended up having a child. Even Raymond didn\u2019t spoil his children like this. Only Andrew\u2019s mother really favoured Andrew.</p><br/><p>Her son was absolutely right, everything her son said was right, her son was heavenly!</p><br/><p>With such a standard, Andrew really walked through the European and American fashion industries with no hindrance.</p><br/><p>As for the East\u2019s fashion industry, Karma\u2019s hand didn\u2019t reach there. Andrew\u2019s \u2018I hate the disgusting yellow people\u2019 didn\u2019t spread to Huaxia because he had never been there.</p><br/><p>Now Andrew was oppressing and insulting a small model as usual.</p><br/><p>In his eyes, Ming Yu was no different from the models he had previously suppressed. This person thought he could go against the sky with no background and a bit of talent. Then Andrew would send him to heaven! Haha!</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Andrew reluctantly smiled. \u201cWait until Uncle Leo answers the phone. I will let you know the status of Huaxia models in the European and American fashion industries!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu looked worriedly at the agent making a call but he seemed reluctant to accept the situation. He stubbornly said, \u201cYou are just bullying a newcomer. You said that as a model of Huaxia, I should listen to you in the European and American fashion industries? Then would you dare say this to Luo Cheng? Would you dare say it to Du Ruo? What about He Chaoman? I dare you to say this to Xi Ze!\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew was shocked when he heard these names. His expression changed when he heard \u2018Xi Ze\u2019 but he refused to change his words. \u201cDo you think I will be afraid of Luo Cheng, Du Ruo and He Chaoman? I\u2019m telling you! Sooner or later, I will be better than them! I will pull them down the list!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu bit his lips. He really looked like he was being bullied, making Mr. Will feel deeply distressed. But Mr. Will was afraid to speak again because he knew that Andrew\u2019s mother really did have a good relationship with Mr. Leo, the chief designer of Ruth Mary. Otherwise, Ruth Mary wouldn\u2019t have invited Andrew to walk in the show.</p><br/><p>Indeed, this was the first time Ruth Mary invited supermodels not on the rankings and there were actually two of them! However, Ming Yu was the one that Ruth Mary really wanted to invite. Andrew came in through the backdoor.</p><br/><p>But what about it?</p><br/><p>Andrew\u2019s mother didn\u2019t care if her son came in through the backdoor. In her heart, her son was the best in the world!</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, the call still hasn\u2019t gone through? Ah, pass it to me! Give it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Uncle Leo? I\u2019m Andrew. I\u2019m in the underground parking lot of Ruth Mary. Uncle Leo, there is a Huaxia model participating in your October high-end show. He dared to provoke me. Uncle Leo, he scolded me and insulted me. You must help me out!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was simply too shameless. Even the very rational Luo Ru couldn\u2019t help shouting, \u201cUtter rubbish! You are simply reversing black and white. You are obviously the one bullying us. You stopped us while we were leaving and told Xiaoyu to apologize to you! You are racist, anti-Huaxia, and also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Leo, listen. They are yelling at me again! I really never suffered such grievances. They have scolded me for a long time and said I would never be on the world\u2019s supermodel rankings. You must\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to be on the world\u2019s supermodel rankings in your life.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

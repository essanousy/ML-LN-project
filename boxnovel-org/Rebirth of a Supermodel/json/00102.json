This time, Ming Yu and Xi Ze split up after getting off the plane. Xi Ze chose to walk through the VIP path while Ming Xiaoyu headed straight to the ordinary path.</p><br/><p>There were two reasons for the separation. First of all, Xi Ze wasn\u2019t really suitable to appear here. It was Huaxia and who knew how many of his fans would be present? Look at his 38.24 million fans on the Muse official website! The second reason was that they didn\u2019t want to reveal their relationship now. If they went separately, it would avoid suspicion.</p><br/><p>However, Ming Xiaoyu had just entered the airport when he saw a group of fans!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Was it too late to go back?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t know how his whereabouts had been leaked. Of course, Luo Ru would sometimes arrange for fans to pick him up at the airport and other activities. But this time, it was impossible for Luo Ru to arrange such a thing. It could only be said that the power of the Internet was endless and his return to Huaxia had been discovered by fans.</p><br/><p>However\u2026when did he get so many fans?</p><br/><p>The fans saw that Ming Xiaoyu was alone and were surprised for a moment. Under normal circumstances, a public figure would be accompanied by a manager, assistant or bodyguards to prevent any incidents.</p><br/><p>Since Ming Xiaoyu had come alone, the fans restrained their feelings of excitement and asked Ming Xiaoyu for a signature. The over-excited fans wanted to get closer, but they were appeased by the rational fans. This allowed Ming Xiaoyu to succeed in breaking through the crowd of fans safely.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was surprised as he got through. It was rare that his fans were so sensible.</p><br/><p>Standing in front of the crowd of fans, the youth bowed down, arousing their excitement. They listened as Ming Yu\u2019s beautiful voice said, \u201cThank you. I am really happy that you came to meet me. Please pay attention to road safety when returning home. I am leaving, so you don\u2019t have to send me off anymore. Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Ming Xiaoyu turned and left, dragging his suitcase while looking back and waving at the fans.</p><br/><p>The excited fans wanted to run after Ming Xiaoyu but were stopped by older fans. Once the enthusiasm slowly subsided, they all excitedly started talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh, Ming Xiaoyu is becoming more and more beautiful! He smiled at me when giving me a signature!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mushroom also smiled at me! But he didn\u2019t want the gift I have him and asked me not to spend money\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery one of us brought so many things. If Small Mushroom really wants that then we won\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true\u2026 Ming Xiaoyu is so beautiful! Don\u2019t you think he is more beautiful than before? I feel like his temperament has become fresher and his whole person is tender! I really want to pinch his face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I also thought Small Mushroom became more beautiful\u2026I thought it was my illusion\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>On the other side, the small mushroom went through many hardships and succeeded in meeting up with the man in the parking lot. Ming Xiaoyu got on the car and sighed with relief. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that my fans found out my flight and came to meet me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow at the words. \u201cZhao Rui isn\u2019t good at maintaining confidentiality?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu shook his head. \u201cLuo Ru is responsible for these things and I believe in her ability. This time, the mistake should come from somewhere else.\u201d A flash went through Ming Yu\u2019s brain and he asked, \u201cWho did you have change the tickets? We changed our flight itinerary so few people should know about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze paused while putting on his seat belt. Then he sighed after a long time. \u201cThis is my mistake. Clucas has always been sloppy and I shouldn\u2019t have asked him to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the car pulled out of the parking lot.</p><br/><p>Since there was work the next day, Xi Ze sent Ming Yu back to the newly bought house. Then he returned to another house for his work convenience.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu waited until night and was about to go sleep when he realized something. \u201cEh, this isn\u2019t right. Even if my trip is leaked, why did so many fans come to pick me up? When did I get so many fans?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Ming Xiaoyu, Ming Xiaoyu, you are supposed to be smart. How could you be so confused?</p><br/><p>The next day, Ming Xiaoyu arrived at the company and learned from Zhao Rui that the total number of fans on his Muse website exceeded 3 million. Of this, only 0.01% were fake fans, so it could be said that almost all of them were true fans. At the same time, Ming Xiaoyu discovered that his Weibo fans had a sudden surge during the time he was in Milan.</p><br/><p>What classified as a sudden surge?</p><br/><p>Well, it was probably faster than a rocket.</p><br/><p>After Luo Ru\u2019s explanation, Ming Xiaoyu knew that there were two incidents after he left Huaxia. The first thing was that New Life broke through one million sales. The second incident was the reality TV show that Ming Xiaoyu took part in previously.</p><br/><p>The reality show called Trump Challenge was broadcasting its third season. In each episode, different guests were invited to cooperate with the original guests of the show for a round of challenges. Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s \u2018model special\u2019 was the fourth episode in the third season and would be broadcast tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The status of \u2018Trump\u2019 domestically was beyond doubt. The program might have a script but every challenge was live. If a challenge required going into the mud, they had to go into the mud with no discussion. Therefore, it attracted many viewers and could be called one of the hottest variety shows in Huaxia.</p><br/><p>Before the broadcast of every episode, Trump would carry out promotion bombings on their own channel. This time, promos of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s episode were unveiled nationwide and he got a bunch of fans.</p><br/><p>A group of models!</p><br/><p>Long legs that seemed to go on forever! Legs that seemed to go up to the neck!</p><br/><p>This beautiful group of people were wearing swimming suits to play a water polo game. Just looking at their faces and bodies were good enough!!!</p><br/><p>In order to show the program\u2019s explosive point, the team also give Ming Xiaoyu the title of \u2018Invincible Challenge King.\u2019 This nickname might seem very arrogant, but the program tried to contrast the invincible state with an image of Ming Xiaoyu as a \u2018lonely master sitting at the peak.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m not lonely at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru continued. \u201cIn any case, this type of promotion has allowed many people to notice you. According to my estimation, your fan growth this time is probably for three reasons. The first is the MV of New Life and the second is the promotions of \u2018Trump\u2019. After tomorrow\u2019s broadcast, your fans will probably surge again. However, I think that the third reason is the most important.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming XIaoyu froze a little bit before asking, \u201cThe most important reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui didn\u2019t give Luo Ru a chance to speak as he sighed. \u201cXiaoyu, couldn\u2019t you take some precautions if you and Xi Ze choose to go out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026Ah?\u201d \uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09</p><br/><p>Yes, even if his popularity rose from the MV and reality show, it wasn\u2019t easy to achieve more than one million fans on the Muse website within a week. The reason why Zhao Rui knew that there were almost no fake fans among the three million fans was because Shen Xiang deliberately investigated.</p><br/><p>The result was that almost all of them were real fans.</p><br/><p>Could a reality show and MV cause such good results?</p><br/><p>Then all of Muse\u2019s models would run away towards the entertainment industry!</p><br/><p>A week ago, a netizen posted a photo with low pixels. This was just a photo of the back, but all fans in Huaxia and the world knew it with once glance.</p><br/><p>\u3010What a surprise!!! God Xi!!! \u3011</p><br/><p>Xi Xe\u2019s height, figure and aura. Even if his face was covered by a mask, all fans could recognize him!</p><br/><p>As for the person walking beside Xi Ze, his face was clearly visible. Those who knew Ming Xiaoyu would recognize him instantly.</p><br/><p>What was this situation? God Xi and Ming Xiaoyu were friends? They went to Milan together?</p><br/><p>With this in mind, everyone recalled that more than half a year ago, an \u2018uppity\u2019 teenager went on the Liu Chao\u2019s Super Show\u2019 and said that he wanted to surpass Xi Ze. Unexpectedly, Xi Ze replied on the same day with \u2018I will wait for you,\u2019 and followed the youth\u2019s official website account and Weibo!</p><br/><p>In the eyes of ordinary fans, God Xi and this small model were friends? Fan fan! Passersby turned to fans!</p><br/><p>In the eyes of some fans: wtf!!! Pink! The sky is pink!!! Become a fan of that Chinese person!!!</p><br/><p>Therefore, at least half of the one million fans that Ming Xiaoyu gained were Xi Ze fans. They were originally members of Muse\u2019s official website, making it simple for them to follow Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu understood this point and didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. He sent the busy man a message: \u3010 Today, I saw that my Muse official website has unexpectedly gained one million fans in a week. Brother Zhao said that it is because of you. Mr. Xi, am I being sponsored by you? \u3011</p><br/><p>On the other side, Xi Ze was discussing the selection of a fabric with the assistant designer. After seeing this text message, he calmly let the assistant director continue while he walked to the side.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Shen Xiang told me this yesterday. This nourishment\u2026Hey, small model that I\u2019ve been raising, how are you going to thank me for this? \u3011</p><br/><p>His phone vibrated and Ming Xiaoyu immediately checked it. He uttered a scornful noise and typed back: \u3010 The hundreds of thousands of fans, how should I thank you for them? I think a meal should be sufficient. \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu received an immediate reply from the other person. \u3010 Oh, then I want to eat mushroom stew, creamy mushroom soup, mushroom fried vegetables\u2026a full mushroom course. \u3011</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>This beauty who wouldn\u2019t die!!!</p><br/><p>As if to prove his own words, despite having a lot of work, Xi Ze crossed the capital and came to Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s house. It was to eat the small mushroom.</p><br/><p>In a normal situation, Ming Xiaoyu would be quite happy to do these things. After all, it felt comfortable. But this time, he severely rejected Mr. Xi at the door. Ming Xiaoyu smiled at Xi Ze\u2019s surprised eyes and said, \u201cMr. Xi, I have to take photos and do an interview with a magazine tomorrow. I have no energy, so you should go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze frowned at the words. \u201cWhat magazine is so important?\u201d</p><br/><p>Recently, Xi Ze was very busy and hadn\u2019t been paying much attention to Ming Yu\u2019s schedule.</p><br/><p>A sly grin appeared on the youth\u2019s face at these words. \u201cYou don\u2019t like the magazine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cPush it away. I\u2019ll find you a better one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu laughed at the appearance of such a tyrant and said with some disdain, \u201cBetter? You want to find a new magazine for me, Mr. Zi? But you should be quite familiar with this one. If I remember correctly\u2026you should own a lot of their shares?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s expression swiftly changed.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu gave a low laugh. \u201cThis magazine is called Muse.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>Friend is doing better. She\u2019s still in hospital but recovering.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was only one in the world and it was tailor made for you alone.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze had been waiting outside the door for a while by the time Ming Yu left the cloakroom.</p><br/><p>The first time Xi Ze had seen this young man, he had looked at the other person\u2019s eyes in the bathroom mirror. He just inadvertently glanced up but had been stunned by the youth for three seconds. At the time, the youth\u2019s cheeks were flushed from drinking and his clear eyes were moist.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was hit in an instant by an impactful beauty that he never felt before. He was completely unprepared and shocked by the other person.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze wasn\u2019t a lazy person. It could be said that the four high-end fashion shows of Ji and Ya occupied almost all his time. At the same time, he was a supermodel. In the past few years, he had to fly around the world for jobs. It was only recently that he slowly faded out of the modelling circle.</p><br/><p>He was too busy so Xi Ze never noticed there was such a beautiful youth in the industry who also belonged to Muse.</p><br/><p>But when Ding Bo showed some past information about Ming Yu to Xi Ze, he stared at the cover of Meditation Road and the photos in Lanka and frowned.</p><br/><p>The facial features had only slightly changed, but the temperament was too bad.</p><br/><p>The youth he saw exuded a calm and elegant air, even if he was embarrassed about hiding in the bathroom. His breathing was very stable and calm. In these photos, he was dressed very beautifully and wanted to put on that supermodel temperament. However, he seemed to immature, like a child wearing an adult\u2019s clothes.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s vision was excellent. Ding Bo didn\u2019t find anything unusual but Xi Ze had already determined that\u2014</p><br/><p>He would never be tempted by the Ming Yu in these photos.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the other person\u2019s exquisite and eye-catching appearance that held his attention, but also the noble and cold temperament.</p><br/><p>Since then, he had known Ming Yu for more than half a year. This wasn\u2019t the first time Xi Ze designed clothes for him. It was just the first one that was actually made. The previous ones Xi Ze drew were just design drafts. He hadn\u2019t finished drawing them before he felt the need to throw them away. This time, he felt that he made something wonderful.</p><br/><p>He had a hunch that only this youth could give the clothing the most beautiful effect.</p><br/><p>This premonition was turned to reality when Xi Ze saw Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Under the bright crystal light, the handsome and tall young man pushed open the door and stepped into the living room with gentle steps.</p><br/><p>At his first sight of Ming Yu, Xi Ze could hear himself swallowing his saliva.</p><br/><p>The suit adhered to Ming Yu\u2019s body, outlining the slender legs and thin waist. The colour that was between a dark red and bright red brought out his fair and smooth skin, making him shine like a gem under the light, leaving people unable to open their eyes.</p><br/><p>The youth had changed his style just the previous day, so his hair was pulled back and his forehead exposed. This face was already exquisite. Without the blockage of his hair, he showed a powerful and noble beauty.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu walked towards Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>It was seemingly casual, but each step was in a straight line, his upper body kept straight and his jaw slightly raised. Such an excellent walk, even the most demanding teachers wouldn\u2019t be able to criticize it.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu only needed to put on a layer of powder and some makeup, and he could walk straight onto a catwalk to show the world this elegant high-end clothing.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu arrived in front of Xi Ze, who recovered from the stunned feeling and looked him up and down. At this time, Xi Ze was a designer. He carefully examined the suit and stretched out a hand, starting to organize it for Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t refuse.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s hands moved around his shoulders and waist. These were normal movements as it was the first time that Ming Yu wore these clothes. He had finished it off in the cloakroom, but it was normal for the designer to reorganize it if it wasn\u2019t what they envisioned.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze helped Ming Yu organize the clothing again. Because of Ming Yu\u2019s short height, Xi Ze had to bow his head slightly when doing the youth\u2019s tie again.</p><br/><p>It was here that Xi Ze showed his critical and fastidious personality. He undid the narrow crimson tie, fastened it again, untied it and fastened it again. He did this over and over for at least five or six times. However, he still felt very dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was ready to tie it again for the seventh time when Ming Yu suddenly reached out and pressed on Xi Ze\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked at the youth in front of him, who smiled and raised his eyebrow. \u201cIf you keep tying it, this tie will have to be scrapped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Xi Ze to speak, Ming Yu grabbed the tie and did it up skillfully.</p><br/><p>His fingers moved swiftly over the crimson tie. This time, the way Ming Yu tied it was very unique. Even Xi Ze hadn\u2019t seen it before, causing him to stare curiously. But Ming Yu\u2019s movements were too fast. Xi Ze wasn\u2019t certain about what he saw when it was already tied.</p><br/><p>This method was truly creative. Xi Ze didn\u2019t know how Ming Yu had done it, but the tie fell straight down inside the clothes, no longer having a slight bulge.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked for a moment before suddenly saying, \u201cWait a minute, I will get a collar clip.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze hurried into the cloakroom. Ming Yu smiled as he looked at Xi Ze\u2019s back, finding the busy appearance funny.</p><br/><p>Yes, no matter how much this man was indifferent and calm, even he would be cautious when it came to the clothes he designed. This was the nature of every designer. Once they learned designing, it penetrated deep into their bones.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze left the cloakroom with a white collar clip in his hands.</p><br/><p>It was a rectangular clip with a white jade inlaid in it, which happened to conceal the clip underneath.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze clipped it to the tie and carefully observed for a moment. Then he nodded with satisfaction and sighed with relief. He walked Ming Yu to the floor standing mirror in the cloakroom. Xi Ze\u2019s hands stroked Ming Yu\u2019s shoulders as he stared at the youth in the mirror.</p><br/><p>Elegant, noble, dignified and calm.</p><br/><p>This was how Ming Yu felt in the suit.</p><br/><p>Ji and Ya held four high-end fashion shows a year. Two of them were determined to be women\u2019s clothing. The other two were randomly selected between high-end men\u2019s clothing or women\u2019s clothing. It was different every year.</p><br/><p>In recent years, although the performance of men\u2019s high-end clothing shows was still quite good, the high-end suit had slowly become scarce. In recent decades, there hadn\u2019t been many innovations in the style of suits, including the British, American, Italian and Japanese styles.</p><br/><p>But Ming Yu had never seen the layout of Xi Ze\u2019s suit.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t cumbersome and orthodox like the British style, it wasn\u2019t as simple as the Japanese style and it wasn\u2019t as spacious and open as the American style. There were traces of the Italian style, but it was more light and elegant.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu stared for a long time. Then he heard Xi Ze whisper from behind him. \u201cUnfortunately, you have changed the colour of your hair. I think that silver and red really match.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was better with his skin.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and said, \u201cI think that this is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze shook his head with regret. \u201cThere is one point that is still worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Xi Ze reached out towards Ming Yu\u2019s heair. His fingers moved through the hair, making the well-groomed style a little messy. It didn\u2019t give off a sense of unstructured beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help laughing when he saw that this man actually made his hair so messy. \u201cYou will have to tidy it up for me later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze pursed his lips. \u201cIgnore it.\u201d He paused and added. \u201cIt looks better than it did before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s lips curved. \u201cYou want me to ignore it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cIgnore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really ignoring it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This silly dialogue was repeated between the two men. If Ding Bo and Luo Ru saw this, they would be surprised and think they were dreaming.</p><br/><p>This Xi Ze/ my Xiaoyu is such a childish person?!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu probably became tired of it. He suddenly turned around and raised his eyes towards Xi Ze. \u201cWill you really ignore it as you said?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze opened his mouth and couldn\u2019t say anything. His words were stuck in his throat.</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s eyes were shining due to a layer of water. The distance between the two people was only 10 centimetres. Xi Ze bowed his head slightly and could see Ming Yu\u2019s fine eyelashes. Xi Ze\u2019s heartbeat accelerated and his eyes darkened as he didn\u2019t utter a reply.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ming Yu also stopped.</p><br/><p>He looked up blankly at the man in front of him. They were so close that he could feel the heat exhaled by the other person against his face. This made him feel the long absent drunkenness hit him again. He seemed to be a bit dizzy.</p><br/><p>The two men looked at each other in silence. No one spoke.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere stagnated, as if the air had frozen.</p><br/><p>No one knew who tried to get close first. But once their lips touched, they both felt slightly shocked and finished the brief kiss.</p><br/><p>XI Ze looked at the youth with slightly narrowed eyes, while Ming Yu stared up at him strangely. There seemed to be a flash of surprise in their eyes.</p><br/><p>The next moment, both of them had no hesitation in suddenly kissing the other person\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>The hot breath was released between the lips and tongue. Xi Ze bent over, his left hand hugging Ming Yu\u2019s waist while his right hand was behind Ming Yu\u2019s head, deepening the kiss. Ming Yu wasn\u2019t to be outdone. He sucked the other person\u2019s thin lips, responding directly to this sudden kiss.</p><br/><p>The ambiguous air spread in the quiet cloaking. Only the sound of tongues meeting broke the silence. Xi Ze\u2019s tongue explored the youth\u2019s teeth and plundered every inch of territory in the other\u2019s mouth. This made Ming Yu give a sweet hum and the two people began a long kiss, neither of them backing down.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After all, Ming Yu would formally be filming soon, so there were many things that needed to be confirmed. Zhao Rui was temporarily unable to leave. As Ming Yu\u2019s assistant, Luo Ru was naturally always with Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu noticed Luo Ru\u2019s expression as soon as he entered through the door and originally didn\u2019t intend to explain anything. However, when he saw Luo Ru\u2019s \u2018As expected, I knew it wasn\u2019t that simple. Why would Xi Ze choose a toilet without paper\u2019 expression, Ming Yu became very worried. If he didn\u2019t say anything, Luo Ru would suspect that Xi Ze was his (\u2026..).</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it too much. I have some relationship with Xi Ze. It isn\u2019t as simple as what I explained to Zhao Rui, but we really are just friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Shen Xiang and Xu Wenshu had been talking, Ming Yu had arranged the information. Now he handed it all to Luo Ru and said, \u201cThis is some information about recent good movie and television roles. Sister Luo, I hope you can gather detailed information about them tomorrow and arrange it for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru took the papers and read it in a low voice, \u201cMale number two in the movie \u2018The Gauntlet\u2019\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice stopped abruptly and Luo Ru cried out, \u201cYou want to act?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This expression that said \u2018How can you go into acting?\u2019 clearly wasn\u2019t good!</p><br/><p>Everyone mistakenly thought he wanted to act and appeared very surprised. It happened before with Xi Ze and now Luo Ru was even worse. MIng Yu sighed softly and explained. \u201cI\u2019m not going to act. I am going to give this information to others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru sighed with relief when Ming Yu promised not to act. She was slightly startled after hearing the second half of Ming Yu\u2019s words and suddenly had a htought.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru was a smart person. She looked at the information on the A4 paper\u2026 although the words were like a dog\u2019s writing\u2014Ming Yu\u2019s signature was very good while his writing was\u2026\u2014 In any case, the information recorded was very comprehensive.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru laughed, \u201cDo you intend to give the arranged information to Lu Zhenxi?\u201d She didn\u2019t give Ming Yu a chance to speak as she speculated, \u201cIf I guessed right, perhaps Lu Zhenxi missing his job is really related to you and not a coincidence. Therefore, you want to make it up to him by giving him this information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Astonishment filled Ming Yu\u2019s eyes and he looked strangely at Luo Ru.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru waved her hand and laughed. \u201cSure enough, I guessed right. You are really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Luo, I think you are misunderstanding me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really want to give\u2026eh? Misunderstanding?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bright sunshine shone through the clean glass, illuminating the laugh of the youth who revealed his white teeth. The laughter was harmless, but Luo Ru was startled by the next question, \u201cSister Luo, did Lu Zhenxi help me?\u201d \u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru stared blankly. \u201cNo\u2026he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu continued, \u201cDidn\u2019t he act badly towards me? He disliked me and even once wanted to bully me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru thought for a moment and earnestly nodded.</p><br/><p>After receiving confirmation from the other side, the youth smiled exquisitely as he helpless waved his head. \u201cThen Sister Luo, why should I help him? I\u2019m not a bad person but I\u2019m also not a saint. Returning evil with goodness isn\u2019t my policy. Xi Ze is the one who deprived Lu Zhenxi of opportunities, not me. I didn\u2019t persecute him, so why should I lend him a helping hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru wanted to refute the youth, but her words were stuck in her throat.</p><br/><p>It was because she found that this youth didn\u2019t say anything wrong!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t persecute Lu Zhenxi, and Lu Zhenxi was the one who immediately took the initiative to provoke Ming Yu. Even just before, Lu Zhenxi had looked resentfully at Ming Yu, completely unable to conceal his inner jealousy and hatred.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru recalled Lu Xhenxi\u2019s ferocious emotions hidden under the calm appearance and thought, \u2018If Lu Zhenxi has a chance for revenge, he will definitely do it without hesitation. He will use all types of means to crush Ming Yu!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Luo, I don\u2019t owe Lu Zhenxi and he is still treating me as an enemy. Why should I want to help my enemy? It isn\u2019t my rule in life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to this, Luo Ru finally understood Ming Yu\u2019s meaning.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wasn\u2019t wrong for not helping Lu Zhenxi. This thing, it was 99% a drawback and 1% harmless. Yes, it was harmful, not beneficial. A man like that wouldn\u2019t be easily touched by \u2018kindness and mercy.\u2019 He might even become doubly resentful.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru smiled as she thought this. \u201cI thought wrongly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu opened his arms, giving Luo Ru a light hug.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru was astonished. This young adolescent who wasn\u2019t yet an adult, he released her and looked at her, the handsome face showing a touch of a gentle smile. Luo Ru could only listen as Ming Yu said, \u201cSister Luo, you have been really good to me in the past six months. Your work is also excellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru felt cold at these words. The yough had been observing her for half a year!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu continued. \u201cIt is a pity for you to be my assistant with these abilities. If there is a chance, I will discuss introducing you as an agent and letting you work with a model with Brother Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Luo Ru was stunned as the word burst out of her. Then she gently smiled, \u201cMing Yu, I think my position right now is really good. It also lets me learn a lot of things. I am really honoured to be your assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled at the expected answer and the two people didn\u2019t talk about their tacit understanding. Luo Ru also knew that Ming Yu originally intended to hand this information to A\u2019Zhao.</p><br/><p>According to Ming Yu, A\u2019Zhao had helped him without wanted anything in return. But A\u2019Zhao didn\u2019t have a choice in this, as it was Ming Yu\u2019s decision.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru couldn\u2019t help chuckling. \u201cXiaoyu, you are really clear when you love or hate someone. You do so much for A\u2019Zhao, while your heart is as cold as the autumn leaves towards Lu Zhenxi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu accepted this \u2018compliment\u2019, opening his hands and speaking helplessly, \u201cWho told him to speculate that I was destroying his progress?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people chatted for a while when Ming Yu suddenly had a thought. \u201cSister Luo, we shouldn\u2019t talk about today\u2019s matters with Brother Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru shuddered and nodded. \u201cYes, I won\u2019t tell Brother Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>The silly and sweet Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u25c7\uff09???\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, Luo Ru neatly collected the details of the two TV series and one movie role. Then Ming Yu called A\u2019Zhao out at noon break and solemnly handed the information to him.</p><br/><p>At first, A\u2019Zhao jokingly said, \u201cWhy is this so mysterious?\u201d However, he suddenly froze and stared at Ming Yu when he saw the contents.</p><br/><p>The youth lightly smiled and said, \u201cA\u2019Zhao. I know that you love acting and want to walk down the path of acting. I hope you can have a good start. I was really grateful when you spoke up for me last time, so I hope these things will help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A\u2019Zhao still felt dizzy. He hesitated before asking, \u201cMing\u2026 Ming Yu, are you really giving this to me? I mean, you didn\u2019t give it to A\u2019Xue or Old Chen? Is this really good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s lips curved, \u201cI have given it to you. What you do with it is up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Ming Yu turned and walked away, leaving A\u2019Zhao who was still unsure if this was good or not.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t ask anything else. He had done what he should. It was up to A\u2019Zhao if he wanted to seize this opportunity for fame or regret the failure of the audience and stay an ordinary intern. These things weren\u2019t related to Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Once it reached the middle of February, all of Ming Yu\u2019s jobs came together and he formally entered a busy working perod. First, he had to finish the MV filming within a week. Then he would quickly go to Character where he would shoot the cover of the March issue. After that, there were the reality show recording in early March.</p><br/><p>Two days before the MV filming, Zhao Rui handed the script to Ming Yu. Luo Ru had specifically reminded Zhao Rui to not let the MV\u2019s plot be too complicated. However, the story wasn\u2019t something that Zhao Rui could decided.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Ming Yu got the script, he looked it over and smiled at Zhao Rui. \u201cBrother Zhao, this story is really great and challenging. I feel really good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026qaq.\u201d</p><br/><p>Good?</p><br/><p>The role that he was playing\u2026</p><br/><p>A good boy next door type was going to play someone with an antisocial personality disorder?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

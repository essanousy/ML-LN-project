Even Ming Yu\u2019s eyes widened because he didn\u2019t think the other person would suddenly appear.</p><br/><p>If other people were unfamiliar with this voice, Ming Yu recognized it instantly. But despite knowing who this person was, Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t understand how this man could suddenly appear here when he was supposed to be on the other side of the world.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ming Yu and Andrew\u2019s group were standing at the entrance of the parking lot. The underground parking lot was full of lights. But it was still underground so the lights were a bit dim.</p><br/><p>In the shadow of the darkness, they saw a tall man calmly walk out. His pace was steady and his shoes made a clear sound that rang in everyone\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>As the handsome face of the god appeared in the light, Mr. Will and Andrew\u2019s agent sucked in a breath and subconsciously turned to look at Andrew.</p><br/><p>The previously arrogant Andrew now went through a big change. His hands holding the phone completely hung down towards the ground. Andrew stared blankly as Xi Ze approached. His lips moved but in the end, he couldn\u2019t speak a word.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked indifferently at the pale-faced Andrew. Then he looked down at Ming Yu and asked, \u201cWho is this person, do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Ming Xiaoyu was reluctantly smiling. After hearing Xi Ze\u2019s words, Ming Yy didn\u2019t have a chance to reply when Mr. Will couldn\u2019t help laughing. After seeing Xi Ze look at him, Mr. Will smiled and said seriously, \u201cThis is Andrew Wallen. His mother is the chief designer of Karma, Mrs. Wallen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made a meaningful \u2018oh\u2019 sound and looked at the pale Andrew. \u201cAndersu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft, haha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mr. Will couldn\u2019t hold back his laugh and even the serious Luo Ru couldn\u2019t help laughing. Luo Ru looked at Ming Xiaoyu, her eyes saying \u2018Xiaoyu and Mr. Xi are really very good.\u2019 In this regard, Ming Xiaoyu could only smile helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAndersu, I know your mother. However, you haven\u2019t answered his previous question.\u201d As if he wasn\u2019t aware of Andrew\u2019s expression, Xi Ze calmly asked, \u201cYou think you can surpass Luo Cheng, Du Ruo and He Chaoman. Then do you think you can surpass me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s first ranked supermodel stood in front of a newcomer and seriously asked this question.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze seemed normal, as if he was asking a question as Andrew\u2019s elder. However, his question caused Andrew to stiffen and not know what to say.</p><br/><p>Andrew hesitated for a long time before eventually saying, \u201cMr. Xi, you might be at the top now but I am still young! I believe I can defeat you. I have self-confidence and my youth. This is my strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d At this answer, Xi Ze\u2019s lips thinned and his original indifferent eyes suddenly became cold. His gaze seemed to be able to completely freeze people. He lightly glanced at Andrew and sneered. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I said? I said that you can never enter the world\u2019s supermodel rankings in this life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew\u2019s expression changed. \u201cWhat do you mean, Xi Ze!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words completely angered Andrew. He didn\u2019t use honorifics and directly questioned Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Andrew felt that Xi Ze was only eight years older than him. Why should he respect this man? Xi Ze might be the best in Huaxixa and the chief designer of Ji and Ya, but it was impossible for Xi Ze to spit in his mother\u2019s face!</p><br/><p>Well, unless Xi Ze chose to become Karma\u2019s enemy!</p><br/><p>At this time, Andrew didn\u2019t know. In Xi Ze\u2019s eyes, Karma was really nothing.</p><br/><p>In the past, this man dared to tear Rosalind\u2019s invitation right in front of its chief designer. The present Xi Ze would dare to go directly to the Karma studio and throw garbage on Mrs. Wallen and Karma!</p><br/><p>Of course, this was just an example. Karma\u2019s design style and level were still good. In Xi Ze\u2019s eyes, they were a pretty good brand. But just because some people had talent didn\u2019t mean she had the quality to match. When it came to raising her child, Mrs. Wallen was simply an irrational and stupid person.</p><br/><p>Now Andrew unexpectedly dared to scream at Xi Ze. If Raymond saw this, he would think that \u2018a newborn calf isn\u2019t afraid of a tiger.\u2019 He would also blame Mrs. Wallen for spoiling her son. She probably didn\u2019t think that one day Andrew would clash with Xi Ze. If she had expected this day, she would\u2019ve definitely educated her son: If Xi Ze scolds you like a dog, you have to go along with it!</p><br/><p>Who do you know who previously received this lesson?</p><br/><p>Raymond, the chief designer of Rosalind, didn\u2019t want to talk about it.</p><br/><p>It was rare to see a model in the industry dare to confront him to his face. Xi Ze felt it was quite novel. He raised his eyebrows and asked, \u201cWhat did you say? I can\u2019t seem to hear you clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew was already enraged by the other person saying he could never enter the world\u2019s supermodel rankings. Xi Ze\u2019s current indifferent appearance made him more furious and he taunted, \u201cMr. Xi, aren\u2019t you taking things for granted? This isn\u2019t Huaxia. It is the west! The United States isn\u2019t yours. I am Andrew Wallen and I will enter the world\u2019s supermodel rankings with my strength. Why are you saying that I won\u2019t go up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I said it, you won\u2019t be able to go up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew wasn\u2019t angry and laughed. \u201cHahahaha! Who do you think you are? Can you really manipulate the World Supermodels Organization? Xi Ze, I will never go to Huaxia in my life so don\u2019t think you can fully control the situation. Don\u2019t even think about threatening me!\u201d</p><br/><p>After these words finished, Xi Ze didn\u2019t open his mouth. There was a long silence before Ming Yu suddenly asked, \u201cWhen did your temper become so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew saw the man\u2019s lips curve upwards as he sighed softly. \u201cI thought you wanted my temper to become better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze spoke in Chinese so the anti-Huaxia Andrew and his agent naturally didn\u2019t understand. But Mr. Will made a startled expression and looked at Xi Ze and Ming Yu with horror.</p><br/><p>If Ming Yu and Xi Ze were in such a relationship, then Xi Ze was Ming Yu\u2019s patron!</p><br/><p>Andrew dared to insult Xi Ze\u2019s lover in front of him, this was a death sentence! Compared to Ji and Ya, Karma was really not enough! Compared to Xi Ze, Mrs. Wallen wouldn\u2019t be able to defend her son!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and replied in Chinese, \u201cI am a bit hungry. Use your favourite method.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cI will listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze turned to Andrew and spoke calmly in English. \u201cAndrew, even your mother wouldn\u2019t dare speak to me in such a tone if she was here now. I am currently in a good mood so get lost back to America. For a year, I don\u2019t want to see you anywhere. If I see you, guess what will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice was flat and contained no anger. It was as if he was saying, \u201cWhat should we eat tonight?\u201d But the contents caused Andrew to be shocked. He screamed with wide eyes, \u201cXi Ze, who do you think you are? I will have Uncle Leo come to talk to you and see if you are qualified to do this! This is London, not your Hua\u2026xia\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew\u2019s voice abruptly stopped.</p><br/><p>He watched in horror at the two men walked slowly out of the darkness.</p><br/><p>The gentle-looking man with a smiling face and silver glasses looked at him with strange eyes. And walking in the rear was an old man. He looked at Andrew and sighed. \u201cAndrew, I heard the whole thing. Listen to Xi Ze and go back to the United States.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew couldn\u2019t believe he was listening to this. After a long time, he cried out, \u201cUncle Leo! He is bullying me. You have watched me grow up. How can you let him bully me in London? Why is he doing this to me? I have to participate in the fashion show, I will participate in the fashion show tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo Todd, the chief designer of Mary, stared at Andrew for a long time with complicated eyes. Then he said, \u201cAndrew, you are 17 years old. This isn\u2019t too young and you should pay attention when talking in the future. Your mother won\u2019t always be able to protect you. Don\u2019t take part in this fashion show and have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what did I do wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this, everyone (except Ming Yu and Xi Ze) showed a strange expression. Even Andrew\u2019s agent looked at Andrew like this.</p><br/><p>The agent was completely on Andrew\u2019s side but at this moment, he realized that Andrew truly had no brains!</p><br/><p>Master Leo looked helplessly at Andrew. \u201cI am doing it for your own good. Go back to the United States.\u201d Then Master Leo looked at the agent and his eyes were suddenly cold. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that you spoil him every time, making him become more and more arrogant. You are also the culprit behind Andrew becoming like this. Once you return to the United States, tell Lisa that her son needs to be disciplined!\u201d</p><br/><p>The agent nodded while sweating.</p><br/><p>Andrew still wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cUncle Leo! You are standing on their side as they bully me! Aren\u2019t you afraid that my mother will come to you if she knows? I really call you Uncle! Yet you don\u2019t help me but help them instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Leo was so angry that he could not speak clearly. \u201cYou \u2026! You are simply unreasonable!\u201d Master Leo decided to leave and said to Xi Ze. \u201cXi Ze, please forget this thing for me. In the next three months, Andrew won\u2019t have any jobs and I won\u2019t let him enter your sights for a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Andrew couldn\u2019t believe this and stared with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze said not to enter his field of view for a year. Now Master Leo was going to deprive Andrew of all jobs for the next three months?</p><br/><p>Andrew was so furious that he swore, all types of rude and dirty words emerging. His fingers trembled as he scolded Master Leo, blaming this heartless and supercilious wolf.</p><br/><p>As Andrew was slobbering and Master Leo was so angry he swore he would never take care of this uneducated and stinky boy again, Xi Ze raised his eyes and asked in a surprised tone, \u201cDid I say he could receive any jobs in the next year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned by these words while Ming Yu could only smile helplessly.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s cold gaze fell on Andrew\u2019s body, followed by a mocking sneer. \u201cI said not to let me see you anywhere in the next year. This includes magazines, fashion shows, the newspapers, the Internet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you let me see you again Andrew Wallen, do you know what will happen?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

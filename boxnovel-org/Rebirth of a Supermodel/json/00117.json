It was right to create her brand at this time. Talented designers like her generally had two paths. The first was to establish their own brand, while the second was to become the designer of a luxury brand studio.</p><br/><p>The first path might seem full of thorns, but it was necessary to climb on their own. In fact, everyone knew that the second path wasn\u2019t simple.</p><br/><p>There were many good luxury brands around the world, but there were more talented designers!</p><br/><p>There were few top luxury brands, while it wasn\u2019t easy for ordinary designers to enter the first-tier luxury brands. In a situation where there were a group of wolves, competition between them was fierce and cruel.</p><br/><p>Those with extraordinary talents like Xi Ze, who chose to design for themselves, were a minority.</p><br/><p>Throughout the day, Ming Xiaoyu helped Fei Sixin and Old Fei entertain many guests along with another supermodel. Then he walked in a fashion show wearing an outfit designed by Fei Sixin.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Fei Sixin arranged Ming Yu to be the finale model instead of the supermodel. Once the youthful figure appeared in the spotlight, everyone immediately stared at him and the sound of the cameras could be heard.</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin\u2019s theme this evening was youth and coolness. Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t often wear these types of clothes. But it was precisely because he didn\u2019t wear it often that the reporters, designers and photographers in the audience were amazed.</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s short hair was fixed to the left side of his face with an invisible clip. He wore a black and white hat on his head that was outlined with yellow thread.</p><br/><p>The simple and handsome denim suit was very suitable for Ming Yu. The jeans exposed a section of the youth\u2019s feet covered by a pair of black and white sneakers. It was very youthful.</p><br/><p>The best thing about this outfit was the irregular fringing on the right sleeve. The light blue fringe hung from the youth\u2019s forearm. It created a beautiful silhouette as his arms moved while walking.</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin\u2019s design style had always been meticulous and mellow. It was focused on creativity and small details. Her unique feminine thinking allowed the men\u2019s clothing to have a simple charm, which contrasted with the steady hard lines of male designers.</p><br/><p>The applause of the audience was heard the moment Ming Yu stood still.</p><br/><p>Amidst the heated applause, the youth turned calmly and walked back down the stage. His footsteps didn\u2019t stop the praise. Staring at his figure, they thought he deserved warmer applause!</p><br/><p>The opening ceremony of Fei Sixin\u2019s brand was completed successfully.</p><br/><p>That night, Ming Xiaoyu refused Master Fei\u2019s invitation in order to go home and pack. The next day, he would be following the An Li cast to H City to start the month-long filming. Recharging his batteries before going was absolutely necessary.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu might not have any talent in cooking but he did a good job with packing. Every piece of clothing was carefully curled, folded and placed in the suitcase so that it didn\u2019t take too much space.</p><br/><p>If a certain man saw the scene in front of him, he would issue one sentimental sentence\u2014</p><br/><p>Really very virtuous.</p><br/><p>As he was packing, Ming Xiaoyu suddenly stopped his actions as he remembered the man who was still on the other side of the world. He sighed as he put down his clothes. Then he picked up the phone and sent a text message.</p><br/><p>The strange thing was that 20 minutes passed after Ming Yu sent the message and he didn\u2019t get a reply.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was very surprised and thought that Xi Ze had something so important that he was unable to send a message back. He put the matterbehind him and continued to pack his things.</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu packed two suitcases, he placed them against the wall and rested for a moment. Suddenly, he heard the doorbell ringing.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was astonished and stepped towards the door. Once he saw the man outside the door through the peephole, he didn\u2019t hesitate and quickly opened the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you come bac\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s voice was drowned out by the man\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu only froze for a moment. Then he raised his hand, comfortably touching the man\u2019s back while pulling the door closed. After touching each other for a while, the two people ended the hug. Ming Xiaoyu raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem like a person who would act like a newlywed. What happened, Xi Ze\u2026what\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s voice abruptly stopped the moment he saw the man\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had seen Xi Ze\u2019s face countless times. He could imagine the appearance even with his eyes closed. Ming Xiaoyu was a model who pursued beauty. He deeply believed that Xi Ze\u2019s face was the epitome of beauty. Now that perfect face actually had a purple bruise on it!</p><br/><p>A purple bruise!</p><br/><p>A bruise!</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>Who was it?</p><br/><p>Who dared hurt the face of the world\u2019s first supermodel?</p><br/><p>Do you know how many fans were obsessed with this face?</p><br/><p>Forget about the fans. Once Ming Xiaoyu saw the purple bruise on Xi Ze\u2019s face, he was angered and thought, \u2018Your mother, who would dare destroy his face\u2019 followed by \u2018Poor Xi Ze, this is my boyfriend. I\u2019m so distressed\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s face changed too quickly. The man\u2019s eyes narrowed as he immediately understood what was going through his small mushroom\u2019s mind. Xi Ze coughed softly and said, \u201cWhat are you thinking? Are you feeling bad for me or are you wondering who hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu immediately looked up. \u201c\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>How did he know?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s face suddenly darkened. \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, he gritted his teeth. \u201cYou should choose to feel bad for me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu hesitated for a moment before nodded. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026There is no pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Ming Yu\u2019s mouth curved downwards as he asked, \u201cCan you tell me now, who exactly gave you the black panda eye? I don\u2019t think anyone in this world would dare hit you, or that a person who hit you can still be living in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised his eyebrow with a hint of interest. \u201cOh? Keep talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu smiled and calmly explained, \u201cAccording to my analysis, there are only two types of people in this world who would be safe after hitting you. The first one is your parents, my parents-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t reply after hearing this.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu continued. \u201cThe other person is me.\u201d Ming Xiaoyu clapped his hands and sighed deeply. \u201cSince I didn\u2019t have a chance to hit you, how did you offend my parents-in-law?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men held hands as they walked into the house.</p><br/><p>Since Ming Xiaoyu moved into the house, Xi Ze came here to live whenever he had a chance. He forgot about his house that occupied the whole floor above. At first, the extremely jealous Ming Xiaoyu would say, \u201cWhy are you going up, Mr. Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Later on, he acquiesced to the man staying overnight. After all, it was quite cool~</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s right eye might be bruised but it couldn\u2019t cover up his good-looking face. The narrow phoenix eyes stared deeply at the youth. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t done by someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu immediately exclaimed, \u201cYou fell yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying this, Ming Xiaoyu had a \u2018I can\u2019t see it. You are actually someone who could do such a stupid thing\u2019 and \u2018it is quite artistic, like a giant panda\u2019 expression as he looked at the man next to him.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u25cf\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth burst out laughing. Xi Ze chose to block the young man\u2019s lips in a decisive manner, stopping the laughter. After all, they haven\u2019t seen each other for a long time and should act like newlyweds. A moment passed before Ming Yu held the man\u2019s waist and responded enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>They kissed and kissed. Xi Ze chose to follow the previous program and move to the bed.</p><br/><p>Who knew that this time, they were only halfway there when Ming Xiaoyu pushed him away, saying breathlessly, \u201cNot today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly as he controlled the lust in his body. He asked, \u201cIs it because you have to go film tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s face stiffened and he quickly nodded. \u201cYes, yes, that is the reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u25cf\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Ming Xiaoyu, your expression was saying that it wasn\u2019t the case\u2026</p><br/><p>You seem to be saying, \u2018Oh my god, this looks too funny. I can\u2019t bear to look\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xi Ze seemed to perceive his true thoughts, Ming Yu immediately raised his hand and said sincerely, \u201cI am thinking about you. This time, I originally said I would be above. After seeing that you are hurt\u2026cough, since you are hurt like this, I will let you rest well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Another kiss sealed the youth\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>This evening, Xi Ze had just returned from France and was probably tired. The two people lay in bed, their ten fingers held tightly together as they talked. For example, Xi Ze should\u2019ve originally come back the day after tomorrow. He deliberately returned two days earlier to meet his small mushroom. Another example was about the role Ming Xioayu was playing this time and how he interpreted it.</p><br/><p>Was there a saying?</p><br/><p>People in love would drink water until full.</p><br/><p>This time, it was really affectionate. They just talked and felt warm in their heart. Apart from\u2026</p><br/><p>Xi Ze asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you turning your head to look at me when speaking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu sneered, \u201c\u2026Cough, today\u2019s horoscope said it is better for me to sleep lying flat down.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this, but at the end of the night, Ming Xiaoyu took the initiative to lean over and plant a good night kiss on Mr. Xi\u2019s lips. It was accompanied by a low whisper and Mr. Xi was finally satisfied after returning to Huaxia.</p><br/><p>[It is good to see you before I go.]</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu said this rather than saying he would do his best.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Ming Yu bid farewell to Xi Ze and carried his suitcases down the stairs. At noon, a large passenger plane flew through the clouds at high speed and landed at H City\u2019s airport after two hours.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

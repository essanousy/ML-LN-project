However, both sides paused at the suddenly question and couldn\u2019t help turning their heads.</p><br/><p>The fat man was the first to respond when he saw the man. He originally wanted to curse and say, \u201cBlocking, what blocking? Don\u2019t you know about detours?\u201d However, all the anger magically disappeared from his face as he discovered the other person\u2019s identity. He smiled and spoke with pleasant surprise, \u201cSir! You are really here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was wearing a monochrome black coat with a classy cut and simple design. He looked down at Wang Zhu, not seeming to perceive the other person\u2019s attentions as he asked bluntly, \u201cDid you want something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Zhu didn\u2019t give up at such at cold attitude. He stuck at it. \u201cSir, last month I spoke to your agent. Do you remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>In this industry, Wang Zhu was indeed a well-known photographer and he often worked for first-tier magazines. He was a veteran compared to Brother Luo and had more seniority, but there were more than 100 photographers like him in the industry, more if they looked globally.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze heard Wang Zhu\u2019s words and glanced at him, before turning to look at his agent. \u201cHe called you before?\u201d</p><br/><p>The gentle man wearing glasses carefully thought for a moment before asking, \u201cYou are\u2026 Wang Zhu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Zhu immediately nodded excitedly, \u201cYes yes, I am Wang Zhu. Previous, Mr. Wei introduced us but our exchange last time didn\u2019t seem that good. I heard that Mr. Xi would be at Ruoshang today and specifically came here to meet you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Zhu\u2019s voice faded as Xi Ze stared at him with extremely cold eyes, as if he was looking into Wang Zhu\u2019s bones. Wang Zhu\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help feeling cold. The next second, he could only listen as Xi Ze spoke coldly. \u201cMr. Wang. I have no interest in the unspoken rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze deliberately placed emphasis on \u2018unspoken rules,\u2019 causing everyone present to freeze in place.</p><br/><p>Apart from Ding Bo, Xi Ze\u2019s agent who was laughing, Wang Zhu, Wu Yuzhen, Liu Qian, Zhu Wei, Brother Luo\u2026 they couldn\u2019t quite understand what Xi Ze meant. Only Ming Yu\u2019s lips curved quietly as his eyes moved between Xi Ze and Wang Zhu several times.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked up at him, as if he seemed to be aware of Ming Yu\u2019s gaze. Ming Yu coughed lightly and withdrew his ggaze.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Wang Zhu recovered and said with slight difficulty, \u201cI just want to talk to you about cooperating next quarter. I don\u2019t know what you mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze replied calmly, \u201cI meant it literally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Zhu: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, as if feeling everyone\u2019s eys focused on him, Wang Zhu turned red and couldn\u2019t help speaking again, \u201cIf it is the unspoken rules, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Ding Bo suddenly laughed and interrupted. \u201cMr. Wang, didn\u2019t he just say that he didn\u2019t want the unspoken rules with you?\u201d Ding Bo saw Wang Zhu\u2019s grim expression, so he smiled and explained. \u201cDidn\u2019t you previously shout that as long as they followed the unspoken rules, you would give opportunities to these youths? It came from your own mouth that unspoken rules are mutual benefits!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other confused people finally realized the meaning of the horrifying words.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhu had tried to flirt and once he was pulled away, he had started shouting. There was no need to mention all the filthy words, but he had definitely emphasized, \u201cSmall models like you. As long you follow me and let me eat your delicious food, there will be mutual benefits!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Zhu paled as he thought of this. A trace of a sneer appeared on Ding Bo\u2019s face, but he pretended to speak in a good manner. \u201cMr. Wang, should I help you talk with Xi Ze? Your photographer standards are quiete good and you can take photos. Cooperation is possible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo cooperation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s indifferent voice interrupted Ding Bo. Under the moonlight, Xi Ze\u2019s face seemed to glow as he looked at Wang Zhu with dislike. \u201cHe is too ugly, I won\u2019t do the unspoken rules with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he would really do the unspoken rules if Wang Zhu looked good? Pay attention to your image! There is a crowd!!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze naturally ignored the public\u2019s sentiments. After dropping these words, he didn\u2019t look at the red and ashamed Wang Zhu.</p><br/><p>If the person wasn\u2019t in front of him wasn\u2019t Xi Ze, Wang Zhu would certainly rush forward and use force to let the other person know who was \u2018too ugly.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, this person was Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhu could easily use his name to oppress Ming Yu\u2019s group and humiliate them. But now that he was being humiliated, he couldn\u2019t move. Xi Ze just needed to stand there and it was enough to make Wang Zhu afraid to speak.</p><br/><p>He wanted to pressure others? Then prepare to be suppressed! This was returning evil with evil, a tooth for a tooth.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhu didn\u2019t dare say a word despite being shamed like this. He just obediently moved to the side. His fat pig face was so lowered, as if he was trying to fit into his clothing.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze chose to walk in front of him, too lazy to even give Wang Zhu any more attention. He only paused slightly when passing by Ming Yu, turning to look at him and gently nodded. Then he left before anyone could react.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo was walking past Wang Zhu when he suddenly stopped and whispered, \u201cWe will never cooperate with those who think about the unspoken rules. Mr. Wang, do you understand?\u201d Then he left.</p><br/><p>The two people came silently and left too fast, leaving behind the ashamed Wang Zhu, the confused people and the thoughtful Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>It was already like this and Wang Zhu didn\u2019t dare say anything more. He grabbed his people and hurried away. Zhu Wei looked resentfully at Wang Zhu\u2019s back, heart filled with hate. Ming Yu had kept a distance from Wang Zhu, so the paparazzi couldn\u2019t take any useful photos! This opportunity had been destroyed!</p><br/><p>In addition to Zhu Wei, the others talked about the shameless Wang Zhu as they walked towards the parking lot. While they were walking, Ming Yu gradually slowed down until he was walking beside Zhu Wei at the rear of the group.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhu Wei.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei was surprised as he suddenly heard his name. He lifted his gaze to see the deep and clear eyes. Somehow, his heart jumped and Zhu Wei got a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>The delicate young man\u2019s eyes curved as he spoke in a mild tone. \u201cI have a joke. There was a butcher who killed someone in the middle of the night and he thought he would blame it on his neighbour. So, he moved the body to the yard next door. But the conclusion of the autopsy was \u2018The butcher killed him!\u2019 This butcher is clearly stupid. There were so many gaps that exposed his sin. He didn\u2019t think about protecting himself but wanted to frame others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei\u2019s face paled and he didn\u2019t know how to answer.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu continued as if he didn\u2019t see Zhu Wei\u2019s gloomy face. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to live in this circle. There are many bright and beautiful people hovering on the line. I have seen many things and don\u2019t want want to expose some of the methods of abuse. My guideline is that as long as you don\u2019t touch me, I won\u2019t touch you.\u201d Ming Yu paused and his smile became more brilliant. \u201cWhat do you think, Zhu Wei?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei nodded and stammered, \u201cAh, ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCherish what you have at the moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this remark, Ming Yu sped up until he was next to Zhao Rui, leaving behind the pale Zhu Wei.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei looked at Ming Yu, who was listening to Zhao Rui, and reluctantly chuckled. The beautiful face made him look like a pure and harmless flower, but at this moment, Zhu Wei completely understood\u2014</p><br/><p>This youth was definitely not a white lotus!</p><br/><p>Just then, he was threatening Zhu Wei by saying he knew about how Zhu Wei climbed into the deputy editor\u2019s bed. As long as Ming Yu wanted, he could grasp the evidence.</p><br/><p>This was a threat! A clear threat!</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei pinched his fingers and looked down at the bumpy gravel road. He slowly relaxed his fist and clearly saw the boy he had tried to suppress. As the other person said, don\u2019t touch him and he wouldn\u2019t touch you\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei became fully aware of someone\u2019s \u2018true face\u2019 and no longer thought about bullying him.</p><br/><p>On the other side, a person was sitting in the back seat of a car, looking at the scenery passing by outside the window with dark eyes that didn\u2019t show what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>Ding Bo looked at Xi Ze in the rearview mirrow and laughed. \u201cToday, why did you think about helping those rookies? You aren\u2019t that kind, Xi Ze.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a long pause and Ding Bo thought he wouldn\u2019t get a response from the other person. But then Xi Ze spoke calmly, \u201cI helped people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly looked over at his agent. \u201cThat pig was too ugly and eye-catching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026He is called Wang Zhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, King Pig.\u201d (TL: Wang means King)</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After another long pause, Ding Bo couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou are speaking like this but didn\u2019t you see the small rookie that you helped? That young model looks good and seems slightly familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you didn\u2019t notice the young model in that group? What a loss! He really looks good. No worse than He Chaoman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up and drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you blaming me because you didn\u2019t see the little beauty? \u2026 Xi Ze, tell me why you wanted to help them. Hey\u2026 Xi Ze, are you going to talk? Xi Ze?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Bo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then why are you talking in your sleep!!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

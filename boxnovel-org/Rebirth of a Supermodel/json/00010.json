Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian were naturally the best in the last two years, while Zhu Wei\u2019s achievements weren\u2019t bad. Ming Yu was slightly shocked that Character would invite Zhu Wei, but he quickly accepted it.</p><br/><p>It was estimated to be a combination of his own strength and the recommendation of others that Character invited Zhu Wei.</p><br/><p>After a brief moment of surprise, Ming Yu calmly greeted Zhu Wei as if they never had friction with each other. Ming Yu acted generously, but Zhu Wei didn\u2019t appreciate it. He just gave a cold hum before turning around and ignoring Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>This made Zhao Rui furious and he fiercely stared at Zhu Wei. Ming Yu was dumbfounded, causing him to speak a few words to appease his broker. Then he finally said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be going to make-up?\u201d</p><br/><p>This morning was spent testing out make-up and styling.</p><br/><p>As Huaxia\u2019s first-tier magazine, Character naturally invited more photographers than Brother Luo. For example, this afternoon\u2019s indoor photos was from a long-established master of photography. His sensitivity for colours was very high, so under his guidance, the photos would be colourful and complex.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei ignored Ming Yu, but that didn\u2019t prevent Ming Yu from forming good relations with Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian.</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen was a really handsome male model. He was only 19 years old, but his height was over 190cm, the tallest among the four of them. He didn\u2019t have an aversion to Ming Yu. After a few conversations, the two of them exchanged contact information as well as their microblogs.</p><br/><p>Liu Qian had a feminine appearance. From a certain perspective, he looked more feminine than the original owner of Ming Yu\u2019s body. At first, Liu Qian was a big aloof. However, after shooting for an hour, he became familiar with Ming Yu was well.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei seemed to have found himself on the outside of this circle. He could only watch as Ming Yu and Wu Yuzhen talked cheerfully, with even the relatively cold Liu Qian speaking from time to time.</p><br/><p>The more Zhu Wei looked at the scene, the more resentful he felt.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu later saw his cold face and once again took the initiative to be friendly. But Zhu Wei showed extreme disdain and didn\u2019t want to integrate into their circle.</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen looked at Zhu Wei\u2019s back and frowned. \u201cThis Zhu Wei\u2026 he seems to have a bad temper?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Qian sneered, \u201cHe is loathsome and thinks he is above us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled and didn\u2019t add anything to the evaluation.</p><br/><p>This was a shoot involving four people. The number of shots wasn\u2019t low, but the opportunity for a solo shoot was small. The photographers divided Wu Yuzhen and Ming Yu into one group, Liu Qian and Zhu Wei in the other group, and both shoots took place at the same time. There was even an occasion where Ming Yu, Liu Qian and Zhu Wei shot together. Zhu Wei tried to suppress his temper and successfully completed the shoot. However, he immediately left after it was finished.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu wasn\u2019t angry that he left, but Liu Qian\u2019s temper wasn\u2019t small. He exclaimed angrily, \u201cHe wants to abandon both of us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu hesitated for a moment between \u2018rubbing salt in the wound\u2019 or \u2018rescuing a person from the well\u2019, before eventually deciding to be a good person.</p><br/><p>The handsome young man smiled and explained. \u201cIt is probably me that he dislikes, not you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Qian showed even more disdain at this explanation. \u201cWhat reason does he have to dislike you? You have the same contract as Wu Yuzhen and I, but his was reduced by 20%. You don\u2019t dislike him, but he dares to dislike you? Geez, there really are weird people every year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it really okay to speak the truth in such a straightforward way\u2026</p><br/><p>They might not get along with Zhu Wei, but the first day of the shoot was completed smoothly. The indoor photos were taken properly. However, the weather hadn\u2019t been good recently. Brother Luo was responsible for the outdoor filming and he had high requirements for lighting. Therefore, the outdoor photos could only be taken a few days later.</p><br/><p>After spending the day together, Ming Yu had some understanding of his peers. Wu Yuzhen and Liu Qian\u2019s strength naturally went without saying. The former was in complete control of his unique style. Meanwhile, the latter still needed to manage his mentality and temper, but his strength was undisputed.</p><br/><p>From Ming Yu\u2019s point of view, these two people would inevitably become domestic first-tier models within the next three years.</p><br/><p>As for Zhu Wei\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is with Zhu Wei today? You didn\u2019t provoke him and even spoke nicely at him. However, he doesn\u2019t appreciate it and always gives you that cold expression! Ming Yu, don\u2019t take care of him the next time you take a photo together! Even if he has the deputy editor of Fashion Entertainment behind him, compared to Muse, she is just a slag!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui snorted as he said the word \u2018slag\u2019 and strongly hit the steering wheel twice.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled indifferently and calmly said, \u201cBrother Zhao, you have to drive well. I still cherish my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui didn\u2019t care about Ming Yu\u2019s words as he kept speaking self-righteously. \u201cAh right, he didn\u2019t show you any face, then Muse won\u2019t give him any face. Even if the company isn\u2019t paying attention to you now, I believe they will certainly value you when this issue of Fashion Entertain is published. If not, they will definitely notice you when Character is published!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help laughing at Zhao Rui\u2019s passionate appearance and agreed. \u201cYes yes, they will notice me sooner or later. Ming Yu paused and continued, \u201cBut Brother Zhao, do you have no confidence in me? Why do we need to wait for the issue of Character?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui nodded imposingly. \u201cThat\u2019s right! You will get noticed as soon as Fashion Entertainment is published! The way the clothing looks on your body and your atmosphere when taking the photos was enough to make you recognized by Master Fei. You can definitely set off a storm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Storm\u2026 Ming Yu didn\u2019t know what he would set off, but it was clear the next day. Half a day after Fashion Entertainment was published, forget about the readers and fans. Ming Yu looked through the magazine for a long time and only found himself in a remote corner.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui: \u201c\uff08\u256f\u2035\u2032\uff09\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do they mean by doing this? Why is your photo in this place and why is it so small?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was so angry that he wanted to storm towards Fashion Entertainment\u2019s headquarters and bring out the person responsible!</p><br/><p>Compared to him, Ming Yu was much calmer. His eyes swept through the full six pages of various photos before finally falling on his own page.</p><br/><p>On this page of the magazine, Ming Yu\u2019s image was reduced to a 2-inch photo, and it was also placed in the obscure bottom left corner. Meanwhile, Zhu Wei\u2019s photo directly occupied half a magazine page in the middle of the issue. This was truly \u2018having support from the sky.\u2019</p><br/><p>The more Zhao Rui saw the magazine, the angrier he became. He couldn\u2019t help standing up and shouting, \u201cNo, I am going to Fashion Entertainment to speak to them! When the contract was signed, your status wasn\u2019t worse than Zhu Wei\u2019s. Why can he have such a good position when yours is so small? I have to look for the company\u2019s public relations department to make them give a statement! Denounce Fashion Entertainment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was still rational and didn\u2019t rush to Fashion Entertainment alone. Since he wanted to use the company\u2019s PR department, Ming Yu didn\u2019t stop him. He just waited for the company to give an official statement.</p><br/><p>But as Zhao Rui said before, Muse was a supermodel company with hundreds of models under them and this was just \u2018Ming Yu.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t enough to make them really oppose Fashion Entertainment. Therefore, after negotiating with Fashion Entertainment, the company got some benefits and promised to give Ming Yu a job that wasn\u2019t inferior to Fashion Entertainment.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhao Rui was no longer angry. He just sneered at the words.</p><br/><p>The company promised to give him a good job so he was already compensated. He also understood that Ming Yu\u2019s position was no better than a new model entering the company so the company not directly ignoring him was already considered fair. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Was Zhu Wei so important that Fashion Entertainment even dared risk offending Muse?</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui signed. \u201cWell, this result is already considered good. It is a lot better than I expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu slightly narrowed his eyes. \u201cBrother Zhao, do you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was surprised by the words and unconsciously asked, \u201cEh? Ming Yu, the job with the new magazine will be very good. I think it is much better than Fashion Entertainment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the bright lights, the handsome face looked like it was covered in a layer of silver and he showed off a remarkable calm atmosphere. Ming Yu smiled with slightly darkened eyes. \u201cBut I think\u2026 this is something that can\u2019t be accepted!\u201d</p><br/><p>That afternoon, Ming Yu called several numbers in his contacts and relayed his request in a gentle tone. Zhao Rui looked at him with worshipful eyes. That night, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., many people wrote on their microblogs in a period of just two hours.</p><br/><p>Some of these people only had tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers. But once they released similar content at the same time, they attracted the attention of many fans of Fashion Entertainment. The most interesting one was Sister Lin\u2019s microblog.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Lin Qi Linda: The magazine was published yesterday, so I can finally be reckless! This time, there really were a lot of beautiful men and women that I refined with make-up. Photos show the truth, so I will release the images! [/Love] [/Love] [/Love] \u3011</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The water was clean and clear, passing through most of the studio before finally falling into a small artificial fountain.</p><br/><p>Once Ding Bo left, Xi Ze bowed his head and looked at the youth hiding under his desk, refusing to come out. This posture was extremely embarrassing. The space under the table wasn\u2019t small. It was difficult to accommodate a 188cm tall teenage, causing Ming Yu\u2019s upper half to be almost lying on Xi Ze\u2019s legs.</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s warm breath blew through the thin cloth to Xi Ze\u2019s sensitive area, making his already excited area stir even further.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe man is gone, come out.\u201d Xi Ze tried to suppress his feelings in his voice as he said in a dumb voice. \u201cUnderneath the table is too small. I will pull you up. Just now you seem to have hit the table. Does your head hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Xi Ze stretched out a hand and pulled Ming Yu out from the table. His movements were so ingenious that with a simple tug, Ming Yu was once again straddling Xi Ze\u2019s lap.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s erotic desires hadn\u2019t completely disappeared. In particular, he was squeezed into such a small space and facing the man\u2019s lower body. Ming Yu was already flushed and the blood in his body was surging excitedly.</p><br/><p>After seeing that Xi Ze was holding his waist and leaning over to kiss him, Ming Xiaoyu pushed him away and coughed twice. \u201cThe words Ding Bo just said, what did he mean? What magazines? 1,000 copies?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s dark pupils shrank slightly. It was just a moment as Xi Ze calmed down and returned to normal. \u201cThe recent Ji and Ya has a magazine project with Muse. Ding Bo was in charge of this matter. I\u2019m not sure about the 1,000 copies but perhaps he is sending them to the staff of Ji and Ya?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s voice was peaceful when he said this and there were no slight ups and downs. It was as if he was telling a big truth, a truth that couldn\u2019t be questioned. But in this sentence, Xi Ze threw all the blame to Ding Bo and a question to Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu squinted suspiciously at the words and tentatively asked, \u201cIs it? Why do I feel like something is wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze just raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he kept rubbing his body against the youth\u2019s thigh. The shameless actions caused Ming Yu\u2019s breath get out of control and he almost couldn\u2019t hold it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d The youth gritted his teeth and snapped out. \u201cI am asking you about a serious matter. Are you hiding something from me\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>A sudden kiss swallowed up the youth\u2019s next words. With this fierce and passionate kiss, Ming Yu couldn\u2019t breathe for a while. He could only let the man\u2019s tongue fill his mouth, sucking up the body fluids.</p><br/><p>The obscene silver strange lingered between the lips of the two people. The kiss was too sudden and Xi Ze\u2019s actions too overbearing and fierce. his rationality was instantly captured and he had to go along with the flow, powerless to respond to this kiss.</p><br/><p>Once the kiss was over, Ming Yu was completely dizzy and almost forgot what he was doing.</p><br/><p>Then Xi Ze didn\u2019t give him any consideration. He gently kiss the young man\u2019s red lips that were slightly inflamed. A sweet sound couldn\u2019t help escaping from Ming Yu\u2019s throat. Then Xi Ze shifted his position and started to bite the white earlobe.</p><br/><p>The tip of his tongue gently poked at the small hole, causing Ming Yu to pant.</p><br/><p>In general, Ming Yu rarely wore earrings but he had the ear hole. At this moment, Xi Ze used his rough tongue to constantly lick the sensitive earlobe. Ming Yu was unable to stop him from doing anything.</p><br/><p>Once the clothes on his upper body was removed by the man, the cold restored some of Ming Yu\u2019s rationality. By then, the man had rudely swept some of the pens and papers on the table to the ground. Ming Yu saw it and asked, \u201cThat is your recent design drawing, isn\u2019t it very precious?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man placed his lover on the table and raise an eyebrow, \u201cDo you know what the most powerful part of your husband is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled. \u201cHusband, you are a ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things that are you in husband\u2019s brain, no one can take it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a shameless rascal. I\u2019m not playing with you. I\u2019m going downstairs to find Brother Zhao and Sister Luo.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xi Ze give Ming Xiaoyu a chance to escape? He did all this and now had to pursue victory!</p><br/><p>As for what he later said to the rogue, Ming Xiaoyu never wanted to recall it.</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t stop Ming Yu from having unstable legs when he left Xi Ze\u2019s office. His whole body was weak, causing him to be held in Xi Ze\u2019s arms as they left the company together.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xi Ze had an exclusive elevator in the company and they weren\u2019t discovered by anyone as they headed to the garage. Only poor Ding Bo found a locked door when he went to find Xi Ze in one hour. The soundproofed room meant it was impossible for the young man\u2019s voice to leak out. Therefore, Ding Bo thought that Xi Ze had already left.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Xi Ze had to deal with many things due to wasting time in the afternoon. After cleaning up the youth\u2019s body, he placed the sleeping youth on the bed.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze carefully arranged the quilt and bent to gently kiss Ming Yu\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Just as he was going to turn away, his clothes were suddenly pulled. Xi Ze turned with surprised, only to see blurred eyes as the youth softly said, \u201cKiss me then go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s eyes deepened as he bent to give his lover a long kiss. Then he finally turned away.</p><br/><p>After leaving, he temporarily didn\u2019t return to Ji and Ya but headed to the Muse building. In the dark of night, a tall and elegant man entered the building with a blank expression and sneaked into his office.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Xi Ze had deliberately locked the door and now he came back to\u2026 cough, clean up the scene.</p><br/><p>Nonsense! How can someone else see his lover\u2019s mess?</p><br/><p>This must be cleaned by himself!</p><br/><p>Pity our pampered lives\u2026 well, this wasn\u2019t really true. Xi Ze was cook at cooking. In any case, Mr. Xi rarely did manual labour but now he was using a wet towel to carefully wipe at the table, the chair, the floor and so on\u2026</p><br/><p>Why was that saying?</p><br/><p>Play for a while, clean up like a dog afterwards!</p><br/><p>After spending more than half an hour cleaning his office of all the evidence, Xi Ze wiped the sweat on his forehead, three things away in a rubbish bin and then drove to the Ji and Ya studio.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s exclusive elevator moved from the top floor to the basement level and didn\u2019t stop on any floor.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t know it but in a coffee shop on the 28th floor of the Muse building, a handsome man happened to run into someone else. The latter smiled and the two people sat down in the coffee shop to chat.</p><br/><p>At this time, most of the staff members in the Muse building had already left work. It was truly fate to be able to meet here. After all, his position was much higher in the company than Lu Zhenxi but Cheng Su politely asked Lu Zhenxi to drink a cup of coffee with him. The two of them sat at a round table and chattered casually.</p><br/><p>At this time, Lu Zhenxi was no longer under Zeng Shu\u2019s hands. He had completely abandoned the fashion industry and decided not to model again. Therefore, Zeng Shu gave Lu Zhenxi to an agent in Muse dedicated to acting, making a clean break.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve never blamed Brother Zeng. My new agent must have a worse position in the company but as Brother Zeng said, I no longer have a way to become a model. It was better to go to the entertainment industry and in any case, I quite like acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su drank the coffee, looking at Lu Zhenxi and said casually, \u201cBrother Zeng is really too ruthless. So what if you offended Ming Yu a bit? Muse isn\u2019t his company, nor is the fashion industry. Why can\u2019t you have a place in the fashion industry despite having a bad relationship with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi shook his head. \u201cI also know that I don\u2019t have talent in modelling. I don\u2019t particularly care about this matter. But Brother Cheng, your words aren\u2019t wrong. Brother Zeng told me it isn\u2019t Ming YU suppressing me. It is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi paused and thought for a moment. \u201cIt is the person behind Ming Yu. Brother Zeng said that Ming Yu\u2019s background is very strong and I can\u2019t fight him. Since the other person doesn\u2019t intend to block me in the entertainment industry, I might as well have a career in acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cBut Lu Zhenxi, you and Ming Yu just had a small disagreement. Isn\u2019t it too much for the person behind Ming Yu to act like that? Are you really not angry? Don\u2019t you feel any resentment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi smiled wryly. \u201cBrother Cheng, I\u2019m not a newcomer who just entered the industry. The industry has always been unclean. One wrong step and I can no longer come back. Now I am a showbiz person. I am no longer a model.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Lu Zhenxi, Cheng Su seemed to want to say something more. But then Lu Zhenxi said, \u201cBrother Cheng, to tell you the truth, I slightly dislike you. I originally offended Ming Yu to please you but now that I think about it, everything is over. I was really wrong. I shouldn\u2019t use other people to climb up if I really value my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su frowned and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I just want to honestly be an actor. I might not climb to the first-tier with my strength but I want to rely on my own efforts to go as far as possible. Brother Cheng, it is the law of the jungle. If I beat Ming Yu now, I can\u2019t say for sure that I am better. When I think of this, I have accepted the unpleasant facts.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su said urgently, \u201cBut Lu Zhenxi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Cheng, shut up. I know that you don\u2019t want me to let go of my hatred of Ming Yu. I know you don\u2019t like Ming Yu. I don\u2019t know why but I heard that you and he had some unpleasant relationship before. But I advise you not to have anything to do with him. Don\u2019t you know? A friend of mine Jiang Kaiyang went against Ming Yu and was blocked for five years. This is tantamount to ruining him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Su\u2019s eyes shone and he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>After chatting for a while, the two of them separated. Cheng Su went downstairs to find his car and a white Toyota disappeared into the night.</p><br/><p>However, Lu Zhenxi\u2019s last words always echoed in Cheng Su\u2019s mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

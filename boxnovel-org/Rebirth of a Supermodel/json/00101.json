Since Mr. Xi started the morning with physical and mental pleasure, he was in a rare satisfied mood and thoughtfully got out of bed to make a light porridge.</p><br/><p>By the time Xi Ze pushed open the door of the bedroom, Ming Xiaoyu was awake, staring at the ceiling with open eyes and not moving.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow at the sight, placing the plate on the side of the bed and asking, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Ming Yu replied in a hoarse voice, \u201cI am paralyzed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Last night, it was unknown how many times Ming Yu gave a low shout, so it was right that his voice was hoarse. But the phrase \u2018I\u2019m paralyzed\u2019 was too exaggerated. Even the calm Xi Ze couldn\u2019t help feeling like this.</p><br/><p>The bright sun shone through the large floor-to-ceiling windows into the house. There was still a mess on the bed, but the obsessive Mr. Xi didn\u2019t pay attention to this issue. Instead, he asked with a low smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu looked at the ceiling and said, \u201cI can\u2019t move from the bed.\u201d He paused before adding, \u201cThis is all your fault. Make it up to me. Help me up first then feed me and I will consider how to punish you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Xi Ze had been coerced. He couldn\u2019t help finding it a bit funny. After all, he was physically and mentally satisfied. Xi Ze chose to play the game of patient and doctor. While feeding the small mushroom, Xi Ze suddenly had a thought. \u201cLast night, you fell asleep and I helped you clean up. Do you have a fever or any stomach pain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu shook his head as he ate the porridge. \u201cFortunately, there is no fever and my stomach doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d After saying this, Ming Xiaoyu bowed his head to take another sop of porridge. But as he looked down, he suddenly remembered, \u201cDon\u2019t you seem quite familiar with this type of thing? You know how to clean up? Oh yes, you also have that item at one of your homes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was a little startled by the words before saying quietly, \u201cThere is nothing wrong with being prepared.\u201d The man fed Ming Yu a spoonful of porridge and said earnestly, \u201cYou are the one who took my first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The mouthful of porridge was sprayed over Xi Ze\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the porridge was no longer hot and XI Ze\u2019s hands weren\u2019t scalded. It was just a mess that even Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t tolerate. He no longer played the patient game as Ming Xiaoyu quickly took a piece of paper and wiped the porridge away.</p><br/><p>As he was wiping, Ming Xiaoyu asked with confusion, \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like being dirty. Why aren\u2019t you showing a reaction despite this? You should be hurrying to the bathroom to wash your hands. It should be for a full five minutes, just like when I first met you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold-looking man watched as the youth carefully cleaned his hand. His deep eyes fixed on the handsome young man and his expression became gentler.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly replied to Ming Yu\u2019s question. \u201cI was able to help you lick that up, how can this be too dirty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze! Can you still make this face? Your good image is collapsing you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The handsome man smiled and said, \u201cIt is okay. I will continue to do it the next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\ub208_\ub208\u201d</p><br/><p>Really, don\u2019t push old virgins. Look at these two old virgins, one was completely without a limit while the other one was paralyzed. The readers can anticipate what a shameless and colourful life these two would live in the future.</p><br/><p>The two people had done too much last night and had no scruples about their bodies, but Xi Ze\u2019s aftermath care was very good. In the afternoon, Ming Xiaoyu was able to get out of bed normally. By the time it was evening, his walking posture was no longer so strange.</p><br/><p>While Xi Ze was making dinner, Ming Xiaoyu leaned against the door frame and watched silently.</p><br/><p>He suddenly had a thought, \u201cNo, didn\u2019t you say yesterday that you thought I was too young for this type of thing? Why are you so skilled? You already have the supplies ready and know how to clean up afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s hand gestures paused at the youth\u2019s words. After a moment, he replied calmly, \u201cThus, I prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, was he a human beast?</p><br/><p>Once the two people sat down at the table to eat, Ming Xiaoyu pushed the millet porridge away, not having much appetite. This time, Xi Ze didn\u2019t wait for him to speak. Xi Ze put down his chopsticks first and asked in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know my relationship with Chaoman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu became tense at the words. Then he chuckled and said, \u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made a meaningful \u201cOh.\u201d Then he said, \u201cBut I\u2019m interested in saying it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s face turned red as he remembered how he was jealous last night. He immediately refused, \u201cI already said that I have no interest. I know that you and Chaoman can\u2019t have a strange relationship. You are just friends, it is normal\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s words made Ming Xiaoyu choke back the rest of his sentence.</p><br/><p>He looked at the cold and indifferent man and things such as \u2018clothed animal\u2019, \u2018truly heartless\u2019, \u2018fickle with the heart\u2019, \u2018you aren\u2019t human\u2019, a slag and so on went through Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s brain. Ming Xiaoyu was determined that if this bastard dared speak ambiguous words, he would throw the porridge in his hand at that handsome face.</p><br/><p>But the next second, Xi Ze smiled and said, \u201cShe is my little aunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu who just lifted his bowl, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Ming Xiaoyu put down the bowl with a guilty expression and asked with a hollow laugh, \u201cShe is your\u2026what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled, coughed slightly and said, \u201cHe Chaoman, she is my little aunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At dinner, Ming Xiaoyu finally learned from Xi Ze why a 26 year old man would have a 23 year old little aunt! They even had different surnames! This good aunt!</p><br/><p>He Chaoman was the late daughter of Xi Ze\u2019s grandfather and grandmother\u2026she came really late.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was only three years old and forced to call a little baby \u201cAunt.\u201d Once Xi Ze grew up, He Chaoman didn\u2019t like being called \u2018little aunt.\u2019 Every time He Chaoman saw this handsome and upright nephew, she would forbid the other from calling her \u2018little aunt.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Yu chuckled at these words and shook his head. \u201cI might not have met He Chaoman but I have seen her from far away. Her temperament is very good and her appearance is also outstanding. Yet you said she banned you from called her little aunt? I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow at Ming Yu\u2019s words and asked, \u201cBesides you, who would dare to order me around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu disagreed. \u201cI have ordered you around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips curved. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have proof of when?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s phoenix eyes narrowed. \u201cLast night, a certain person told me to go faster\u2026well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth immediately stood up and covered the man\u2019s mouth. He scolded, \u201cYou bastard, how did I get along with you? Isn\u2019t this false advertising? Before we were together, you were like a male god. After we got together, I think you are a shameless person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze spread open his hands, \u201cSee, except for you, who would dare criticize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Xi Ze picked up his chopsticks and said casually, \u201cChaoman isn\u2019t the way you think she is. She is very different from your imagination.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s expression became blank at the words. \u201cWhat did I imagine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you think she looks like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thought for a moment before replying, \u201cShe should be very dignified and lady-like, a goddess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cThat is completely wrong. He Chaoman has only one hobby that she loves in her life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man suddenly paused and didn\u2019t continue talking. This stirred up the youth\u2019s curiosity. After waiting for Ming Xiaoyu to become a bit impatient, Xi Ze smiled and said, \u201cMy little aunt has only one hobby in life. That is\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSitting at home playing games.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What about the goddess?</p><br/><p>This was truly the winner of life.</p><br/><p>He always became surprised since getting involved with this guy!!</p><br/><p>Due to Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s physical reasons, the plane ticket originally scheduled for the next day was delayed by a day. The two people stayed in Xi Ze\u2019s Milan house for two days before returning to Huaxia. They had just arrived in Huaxia and hadn\u2019t even left the airport yet when Ming Xiaoyu was blocked by a crowd.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

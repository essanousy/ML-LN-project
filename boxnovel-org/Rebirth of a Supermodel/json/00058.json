The MV was for a song by one of the hottest singers in CX Entertainment, so the company attached great importance to it.</p><br/><p>As mentioned before, this world\u2019s Huaxia was strict about copyrights, cracking down on piracy. People needed to pay if they wanted to watch the online video or listen to the song. As a result, this world\u2019s album music sales were always very good. Every year, there was an album that broke through millions of sales.</p><br/><p>For example, Zhao Rui ambitiously fought for this MV because CX Entertainment\u2019s sales volume was expected to be 600,000.</p><br/><p>It stood to reason that for such a big MV project, CX Entertainment should choose a new actor instead of a model with little acting experience. However, after seeing Ming Yu on the cover of Meditation Road, the people of CX Entertainment were glad that they chose Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Yes, the sexy and provocative Ming Xiaoyu on the cover of Meditation Road was too fitting with the MV male lead character!</p><br/><p>A few years ago, the Huaxia MV market had entered the popular stream of consciousness. Recently, fans seemed to love MVs with a flowing plot. This song\u2019s style was a punk alternative and the lyrics were stimulating, so the identity of the role played by Ming Yu was\u2014</p><br/><p>A serial killer with an antisocial personality disorder.</p><br/><p>\u2026Yes, a killer.</p><br/><p>A serial killer\u2026</p><br/><p>Fans would never think Xiaoyu could play such a role! The boy next today was going to transform into a serial killer? If he was successful, he would gain a lot of new fans!</p><br/><p>A few years ago, an actor played a merciless and enchanting character, causing many new fans to become intoxicated with this cold but beautiful character!</p><br/><p>Having said that, Zhao Rui was still very anxious before the MV shooting, Even Luo Ru was a little restless.</p><br/><p>Adding in Ming Yu, a total of four people carefully studied the script. First of all, there was Zhao Rui. He negotiated with the director and writer for a script that didn\u2019t need excellent acting skills. The second was Luo Ru. After Ming Yu received the script, she helped draw attention to some areas and lines in the script. The third person wasn\u2019t Ming Xiaoyu, but Sister Zheng! Sister Zheng designed the makeup and a new hairstyle according to the script. Finally, there was the confident Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>Three days passed since Zhao Rui handed the script to Ming Yu. In these three days, Ming Yu had figured out the plot and looked for the same murderous characters in the DVDs and notes that Brother Yuan gave him.</p><br/><p>The originally clean and tidy script was now covered in small and dense writing. The words were so small that probably no one could read it except Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>\u2014Dog handwriting Ming Xiaoyu still maintained his supremacy \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, there will be no mole. I remember that the script said that the killer\u2026 cough, the actor\u2019s face is very pale. The mole is such a dark contrast that the difference is too much.\u201d Sister Zheng spoke while holding the makeup brush in her hand.</p><br/><p>Once the makeup was over, Zhao Rui and Luo Ru came to take a look. But when they looked at Ming Yu, their mouths twitched in a strange manner before they said, \u201c\u2026If I hadn\u2019t seen you sitting here while the makeup was applied, I really wouldn\u2019t think this was you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was the makeup too ugly?</p><br/><p>Of course not!</p><br/><p>Once again, the people of CX Entertainment were overjoyed and shocked to the heavens when they saw Ming Xiaoyu on the cover of Meditation Road. You know, the set of photos from Medidation Road were the Ming Xiaoyu bible for fans! But the beauty right here was enough to make them lick their phones all night!</p><br/><p>The reason why Zhao Rui and Luo Ru felt strange was because they had never seen such a harsh Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Previously, Ming Yu hadn\u2019t dyed his hair and it was his natural hair colour. For today, Sister Zheng specifically applied a one-time hair due and dyed it pure black. They didn\u2019t know whether wax or anything special was put in the hair, but Ming Yu\u2019s hair was styled in a mixed disorderly manner.</p><br/><p>Messy! Decadent! Negative! Cold!</p><br/><p>The youth had a pale face, blood-coloured lips and shadowed eyes. The change was simple, but it allowed Zhao Rui and Luo Ru to see the killer in the script, rather than Ming Xiaoyu.</p><br/><p>After looking carefully, Zhao Rui wiped bitter tears and grasped Sister Zheng\u2019s hand. \u201cSister Zheng, you are just too good! I really couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. I could only stand here! Ming Yu will succeed! If everything goes well with the shooting this time, I really have to thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it really appropriate to say such things right in front of him?</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was full of confidence as he entered the studio, because \u2018I studied the script more than 20 times in three days,\u2019 \u2018I saw a dozen or so movies with killers,\u2019 and \u2018I specifically consulted with Brother Yuan.\u2019</p><br/><p>The director didn\u2019t know Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s \u2018crazy acting\u2019 nickname and was happy to explain a few things to him. Then he reminded Ming Yu that it would be best if the first shot was a one-time pass.</p><br/><p>Listening on the side, Luo Ru and Zhao Rui had bloody expressions on their faces as they stood with the confused Sister ZHeng.</p><br/><p>But rather than the horror that Zhao Rui and Luo Ru were expected, Ming Yu unexpectedly passed his first shot smoothly!</p><br/><p>This was a pie falling from the sky, stepping on gold, Xi Ze going into a toilet with no paper\u2026 cough, anyway, it was impossible!</p><br/><p>Thus, the director was tricked by Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s acting. MIng Xiaoyu performed very well in the next few shots. He wasn\u2019t comparable to a movie actor or actress, but the smooth filming was remarkable.</p><br/><p>After three scenes, there were a small break. Zhao Rui frowned and asked with confusion, \u201cXiaoyu, how did you progress so much? I feel\u2026 I feel like the gap between your current self and when you shot the Shu Yue Lemonade ad is too big!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a huge gap. He originally NG three times on a simple smiling scene, now he passed through consecutive scenes!</p><br/><p>\u2026Was Brother Yuan\u2019s acting lessons so powerful? Don\u2019t tell me that Brother Yuan was a sage pretending to be an ordinary person?</p><br/><p>Brother Yuan, who was teaching with great care, \u201cAchoo! Who said something bad about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu drank his medicine drink while listening to Zhao Rui. Then he calmly replied, \u201cIt is because my acting improved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026#\uff04\uff05#\uff04\uff05#\uff04#\u201d</p><br/><p>It was too strange.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Luo Ru suddenly understood. \u201cMing Xiaoyu, don\u2019t tell me that you are particularly suited for these types of roles?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru fell silent as she, Zhao Rui and Sister Zheng stared at Ming Yu. Five seconds later, the three people stepped back in order to get a little furthur away from this dangerous element!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s brow furrowed at the sight and he solemnly explained, \u201cMy acting really did improve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, Luo Ru and Sister Zheng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would believe that?</p><br/><p>Luo Ru had a suggestion. \u201cMing Xiaoyu, try acting like a groom who is marrying his first love!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was slightly surprised for a moment, before putting on a very serious expression.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, Luo Ru and Sister Zheng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What is with the \uff08*\uffe3\uffe3*\uff09 expression?</p><br/><p>You should be like \u2018qaq\u2019, \u2018t^t\u2019 or \uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\uff0c It was better than \uff08*\uffe3\uffe3*\uff09!!!</p><br/><p>Are you getting married to your first love or your enemy?!!!</p><br/><p>Sister Zheng lamented, \u201cI finally understand what you mean. This acting\u2026 10 cows can\u2019t pull it back to the goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru covered her eyes because she couldn\u2019t bear to see it anymore. \u201cAh, Ming Xiaoyu can play this role because\u2026 he must really be suitable for this antisocial personality.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three people once again stepped back.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It came this far, so Ming Yu had no choice but to admit it. \u201cIn fact, I was repeating a sentence in my mind while acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui asked, \u201cWhat is that sentence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu smiled slyly and replied indifferently. \u201cI repeated: spicy chicken, you are spicy chicken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spicy chicken Zhao Rui, Luo Ru and Sister Zheng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m not saying that you are spicy chicken. I mean that everyone here is spicy chicken.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the staff members present, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Today was the first day and only Ming Yu was present. So, this first day was only for solo Ming Yu scenes.</p><br/><p>Although their mouths said, \u201cMy Xiaoyu can act?\u2019, Zhao Rui and Luo Ru couldn\u2019t help feeling startled as they saw the complex act that the youth was putting on in the middle of the studio.</p><br/><p>This was a very bad neighbourhood. The ground was littered with waste and even blood could be seen.</p><br/><p>The handsome youth with a face that was as beautiful as a girl\u2019s, as long as he appeared, he was destined to attract the attention of countless people. The eyes were from amazed and a few jealous ladies, and\u2026a handful of men filled with filthy desires.</p><br/><p>This young man walked down the street like he didn\u2019t know anything, his hands in his coat pockets. The coat was too big and the youth\u2019s thin body seemed like it would be blown away in the wind.</p><br/><p>A gust of wind blew, causing the young man to raise a hand to his mouth as he coughed. After coughing, a few tears filled his eyes and a slight flush appeared. The pale face suddenly became rosy, making the young and delicate face seem more beautiful and stunning!</p><br/><p>At this moment, a middle-age man sitting on the corner street couldn\u2019t resist, quietly getting up and following the youth.</p><br/><p>The next day, the residents of the nearby alley woke up and\u2026</p><br/><p>Found a male corpse!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

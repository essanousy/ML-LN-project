The surprising thing was that none of the fans were shocked and didn\u2019t react to the announcement. They continued looking at the record of the mushroom husband\u2019s shameful show of love, repeatedly covering their faces while screaming.</p><br/><p>Did this type of thing still need an announcement?</p><br/><p>It was just a nail in the board!</p><br/><p>Now they only cared about to what extent the mushroom husbands can be contaminated and to see how shameless they can be!</p><br/><p>In the past, Xi Ze and Ming Yu used to show a variety of love on their Weibo and Muse fan forums, making many fans eat dog food. But maybe to maintain their image, the two people were quite serious and their flirting was also short, making fans feel: \u3010 My god is really sweet\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>These days, they ate too much sugar!</p><br/><p>Everyone was a predator, didn\u2019t they eat meat?</p><br/><p>For example, in the past few months, there was a magazine cover shot by Ming Xiaoyu that was quite sexy and glamorous. This wasn\u2019t the first time that Ming Yu wore women\u2019s clothing, after all, he walked in the Ji and Ya show in a wedding dress. But this was the first time that Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t be distinguished between a male or female.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s photos might be lacking in recent years but that didn\u2019t mean there was none. Over the years, Xi Ze was the VIP on the cover of the world\u2019s major fashion magazines and there were many beautiful photos\u2014 although most of them had a cold and strong aura that shocked the fans.</p><br/><p>Now was it possible to say they weren\u2019t dirty at all?</p><br/><p>The Weibo was evidence! Dirty, dirty, dirty!!!</p><br/><p>In just three days, many works were born. These works completely surpassed the previous level as the authors and artists opened their minds to their gods\u2019 true nature. At the same time, many fans howled unceasingly.</p><br/><p>\u3010 As a God Z and Good Legs CP and a mushroom husbands CP fan, I am really dead! I keep eating dog food every day as I watch these pairs of lovers. Now you are suddenly telling me that they are the same person? Excuse me? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I am stuffed with dog food! There is so much dog food! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 360\u00b0 of dog food! I escaped the mushroom husband but didn\u2019t expect to be hit by God Z! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Hey, I actually thought that God Xi was a high and cold male god. After seeing God Z\u2019s dirty and lewd face, I\u2019ve changed from a loyal fan to\u2026 a brainless fan ahhh! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Small Mushroom and God Xi\u2019s side account, really good! He dares to make God Xi kneel on the washboard! My mushroom is really GJ! Give him 10,000 =3= \u3011</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>There were many fans who quoted the classics and finally figured things out.</p><br/><p>For example, what did the name Zyu represent? This represented Ze Yu. Then look again. When did the God Z side account appear? It was when Xiao Xiao Yu Yu shone in the fan circle, making many people call her the lead mushroom.</p><br/><p>Based on careful reasoning, it was obvious that Xi Ze was jealous!</p><br/><p>The Goddess Xiao becoming a big hand in the Ming Xiaoyu fan circle, he wasn\u2019t satisfied!</p><br/><p>Then look at the I want to break my wife\u2019s leg account. When did it appear? It was when God Z was bullying the fan circle, revealing all types of dazzling things to become the lead mushroom!</p><br/><p>Geez, look at the first few posts between these two people.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiao felt that God Xi was spending to much money and was very bitter about having a spendthrift wife at home.</p><br/><p>My god! The original Ming Xiaoyu was aware of God Z\u2019s identity and registered a side account in this name in order to scold God Xi. Then it was unknown how it happened by God Xi figured out the identity and the two of them continued to show love with their side accounts.</p><br/><p>Do you have this much dog food?</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t want money for the dog food?</p><br/><p>It was a duty to show love to single dogs!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was somewhat surprised when he first learnt of this incident but he accepted it quite calmly. Zhao Rui wondered how he could be so calm. After all, this incident was really noisy. Muse didn\u2019t suppress the media so the major media also reported on it.</p><br/><p>However, Ming Yu replied with a smile, \u201cWe didn\u2019t say anything strange on our side accounts. At most, we quarreled and I didn\u2019t try to maintain my image as much as I normally do. This image is good enough for me and Xi Ze. Is this detrimental to our images compared to Adenes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui agreed after hearing this.</p><br/><p>The most important thing that Adenes did in the last two years were her confessions.</p><br/><p>In the past, Adenes was a male model and active in the European and American fashion industries. He rarely had opportunities to see He Chaoman, let along communicate with her. Moreover, He Chaoman was a complete house person and wouldn\u2019t go out except for necessary jobs. It was natural that Adenes wasn\u2019t aware of this top female model.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until both of them walked in the Ji and Ya high-end show that they had the opportunity to make contact.</p><br/><p>Adenes\u2019 first reaction was, \u201cThis world has such a beautiful woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Well, the above sentence was the netizen\u2019s nonsense.</p><br/><p>In any case, Adenes was attracted to the small aunt at first glance. Please note that Adenes was recognized by the media as the \u2018most beautiful supermodel in 50 years\u2019. Whether it was in figure, looks, temperament, everything was first class. Of course, she was the best in appearance but there were a few outstanding people who could match her in temperament and aura.</p><br/><p>Adenes was self-confident and exuded a \u2018I am a walking body of hormones, be attracted to me,\u2019 yet He Chaoman ignored him at the backstage of the Ji and Ya show.</p><br/><p>From then on, this path began.</p><br/><p>This road was really long. Adenes\u2019 limit on Twitter and Weibo was definitely lower than Ming Yu and Xi Ze. But in He Chaoman\u2019s eyes, her games were more important than Adenes.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even if Ming Xiaoyu and Xi Ze released a bit of their moral integrity on Weibo, it was nothing compared to Adenes. They were highly principled compared to many other supermodels in the industry! Did you see the American model last month who was exposes sniffing photos of small models~</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s fans often felt: \u3010 My mushroom is a really clear stream\u2026 \u3011</p><br/><p>Of course, this sentence was ridiculed by many sunspots.</p><br/><p>Even if it was ridiculous, facts were facts. The incident this time didn\u2019t shake the foundations of Ming Yu and Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Now there were only a few things that could cause them accidents in the industry but the two people weren\u2019t racist and were also passionate about their country. The sunspots really had nothing to use against them.</p><br/><p>After this incident, Xi Ze and Ming Yu didn\u2019t post anything on their side accounts. Fans took it for granted that they would give up on the two side accounts. But just as things finally subsided, Zyu\u2019s Weibo made a post.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: They say I have no face, what do you think @I want to break my wife\u2019s leg? \u3011</p><br/><p>Fans: \u2026.Dammit! This wasn\u2019t part of the script!</p><br/><p>A few hours passed and Ming Yu replied:</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: Look at my ID for the answer hehe. \u3011</p><br/><p>Fans: QAQ I\u2019m going to cry okay! They dared show such love?</p><br/><p>\u3010 Zyu: In the end, the fans know who should be the wife. Your ID should be changed. \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I want to break my wife\u2019s leg: I\u2019m at work. Don\u2019t make trouble. \u3011</p><br/><p>Fans: Ahhhh give us our life back!</p><br/><p>Since then, Ming Yu and Xi Ze acted like their side accounts hadn\u2019t been discovered. They still calmly used two accounts to show their love. Some small things in life and some unrestrained flirting would be posted on the side accounts while sweet words of love and work things would be published on their main ones.</p><br/><p>Both sides showed love together.</p><br/><p>It seemed that everyone in the world knew their side accounts except for them.</p><br/><p>For example, today Ming Yu talked about work with Xi Ze. Then immediately on the side account, he proudly said that he wanted to eat Zyu\u2019s cooking, he really wanted to eat.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze would reply on the main account that he missed Ming Yu. Then on the side account, he would say, \u2018I miss you. You eat food, I eat you okay?\u2019</p><br/><p>Who were the most loving husbands in the world?</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t run away!</p><br/><p>After Ming Yu walked in the high-end Ji and Ya show, many people found the ring on his ring finger and speculated that these two people had secretly married. Neither Xi Ze or Ming Yu publicly admitted to this matter. However, two years later, the two of them released a photograph on their side accounts.</p><br/><p>Two hands were holding each other tightly, a simple and beautiful ring on their ring fingers.</p><br/><p>There was only one sentence attached.</p><br/><p>\u300e This circle, you can\u2019t escape. \u300f</p><br/>\n</div>"}

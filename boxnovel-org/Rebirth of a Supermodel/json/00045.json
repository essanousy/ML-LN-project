The door was slowly pushed open, the \u2018squeak\u2019 sound resonating in everyone\u2019s heart, causing them to feel cold.</p><br/><p>The moment that the handsome and tall man appeared in front of the door, don\u2019t talk about Brother Yuan, A\u2019Zhao and the others. Even Zeng Shu couldn\u2019t help halting in his tracks, his eyes widening with horror.</p><br/><p>There was once a master who evaluated Xi Ze\u2019s fashion show: \u201cIf you say that he is a giant, then he is a giant standing at the peak of all supermodels. If he is a king, he is the leader who guides the world\u2019s supermodels. When he appears on the T stage, you can\u2019t help but feel insignificant. The combination of him and the clothes lights up the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>In most cases, models wouldn\u2019t show their aura outside of the catwalk. For example, Cheng Su and Wu Yuzhen had handsome faces, but when you saw them, you would only think \u2018This person is a celebrity,\u2019 not \u2018This person is a model.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, some people were doomed to be the exceptions. It was He Chaoman among the female models, and Xi Ze and Ming Yu among the male models.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xi Ze didn\u2019t have to do too much. He just stood there and looked down. To Zeng Shu and Lu Zhenxi, his image was already big enough.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze stepped into the training room. The door closed behind him with a \u2018click\u2019, as if his presence was being locked into everyone\u2019s hearts. This caused Old Chen to directly shake for a moment.</p><br/><p>They might be newcomers with potential that Muse was developing, but how could they see Xi Ze in person?</p><br/><p>It was too hard.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze entered the room without releasing the hand holding Ming Yu. He glanced around indifferently before stopping one metre in front of Zeng Shu and Lu Zhenxi. Then he raised an eyebrow with surprise and asked in a flat tone, \u201cZeng Shu?\u201d</p><br/><p>The tone of this question made the other person feel even short, as if he was asking \u2018Are you Zeng Shu?\u2019</p><br/><p>But Zeng Shu wasn\u2019t so easy to shake and his temper wasn\u2019t easily provoked. In front of Xi Ze, he just smiled lightly and adjusted his glasses before nodded slightly. \u201cLong time no see, Mr. Xi. Aren\u2019t you busy with the Ji and Ya fashion show that is taking place early next year?\u201d</p><br/><p>As previously mentioned, Xi Ze\u2019s identity in Muse was complex.</p><br/><p>His studio was in Muse and he could be regarded as a Muse model. He was also a major shareholder in Muse and regarded as one of the most important members of the company\u2019s decision making. But he was the chief designer of the world\u2019s top luxury brand, Ji and Ya, which had no cooperation with Muse and they couldn\u2019t be linked together.</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, many people in the company simply call him \u2018Mr. Xi\u2019 instead of giving him other special titles.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze lightly nodded at Zeng Shu\u2019s words and replied casually, \u201cYes, I am busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu couldn\u2019t help frowning at the simple answer. His lips slightly pouted, but he didn\u2019t say anything. After a moment, Zeng Shu nodded to Ming Yu and politely said, \u201cExcuse me, I will leave first with my model. He has a trip tomorrow, so I have to familiarize him with the details today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu started walking with Lu Zhenxi following behind him in a trance.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu had nearly left when Xi Ze had a question. Xi Ze looked down at Zeng Shu and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you invite Ming Yu to dinner tonight as an apology?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu\u2019s eyes widened and in a place where other people couldn\u2019t see, his fingernails tightly embedded into the palm of his hands.</p><br/><p>After a while, he smiled and looked up. \u201cMr. Xi, I invited Ming Yu for a meal, but I\u2019m afraid Lu Zhenxi really can\u2019t attend.\u201d Zeng Shu paused and added, \u201cPlease don\u2019t get me wrong. The situation isn\u2019t what you are imagining.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s solemn face unexpectedly showed an indifferent smile at these words. The smile was without a trace of temperature, a cold ice-like indifference. He glanced at Lu Zhenxi and calmly spoke. \u201cDidn\u2019t this person bully Ming Yu and asked him to dinner to apologize for his crime?\u201d</p><br/><p>The training room suddenly feel silent. Nobody dared to even gasp.</p><br/><p>Only Ming Yu looked up into the eyes of the man still holding him. He could understand the other person\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>Bully.</p><br/><p>This word was too serious.</p><br/><p>Before this, Brother Yuan only dared to explain what happened between Ming Yu and Lu Zhenxi as a small conflict. He didn\u2019t dare say that one side bullied the other.</p><br/><p>A big company like Muse could fall into chaos without any basic rules. In this regard, the most common thing was bullying and pressuring newcomers.</p><br/><p>You say that Ming Xiaoyu isn\u2019t a newcomer and Lu Zhenxi barely just debuted? This was nothing in God Xi\u2019s eyes. If he said it was bullying then it was bullying.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze fell silent after saying these words. He indifferently looked down at Zeng Shu and Lu Zhenxi.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu\u2019s face paled. He didn\u2019t dare deny Xi Ze\u2019s words, but if he agreed, he was admitting that Lu Zhenxi bullied Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>This situation where he had to suffer in silence, it was a really bitter feeling. Zeng Shu gritted his teeth, causing blood to flow down to the stomach.</p><br/><p>Finally, Zeng Shu sighed as he gave up his own dignity forLu Zhenxi\u2019s interests. Rather than looking at Xi Ze, he glanced towards the boy standing behind Xi Ze and who was protected by the man. He spoke in a sincere tone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Ming Yu. I didn\u2019t discipline my model, so please forgive me. Tomorrow I will personally bring him to apologize to you, as well as buy dinner for you and everyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhenxi heard his agent say such unexpected words and wanted to open his mouth to refuse. However, he had just opened his mouth when Xi Ze stared at him. This cold indifference gave off a death-like suffocating feeling. Lu Zhenxi shook and couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu had lowered his attitude and given a sincere apology. Thus, Ming Yu smiled lightly and replied, \u201cBrother Zeng, you don\u2019t have to. It really isn\u2019t a big deal. Xi Ze\u2019s words are a bit exaggerated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu shook his head in response. He once again confirmed to Ming Yu that he would bring Lu Zhenxi to apologize tomorrow, before planning to leave again. However, Xi Ze sighed softly just as Zeng Shu reached the door.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu paused while grabbing the door handle.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze gently sighed and asked, \u201cZeng Shu, where did you travel a few days ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Zeng Shu replied, \u201cI went to the United Kingdom and won an international second-tier global endorsement. I just returned this afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked when hearing Zeng Shu\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t this be regarded as Zeng Shu\u2019s secret?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze asked a casual question and Zeng Shu didn\u2019t hide anything?</p><br/><p>A glimmer of appreciation flashed in the man\u2019s dark eyes. Xi Ze didn\u2019t look at Zeng Shu, turning towards the youth man beside him. Then he calmly said, \u201cMany things have developed rapidly, and there is much you should know. Zeng Shu, you should find out what happened in the company over the last few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a brief moment of silence. Then Zeng Shu respectfully replied, \u201cGood, Mr. Xi.\u201d He pushed open the door to leave with Lu Zhenxi. But before leaving, he bowed to Xi Ze and said, \u201cWe will be going first, Mr. Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the door clicked shut again, Ming Yu closed his eyes and sighed in his heart.</p><br/><p>Compared to Zhao Rui, Zeng Shu was an extremely tough agent. In a sense, he was also a good agent.</p><br/><p>He tried his best to safeguard his models and when it came to a choice between his dignity and Lu Zhenxi\u2019s interests, he chose the latter.</p><br/><p>But this trait of Zeng Shu was precisely his drawback. He defended his models, but he didn\u2019t teach his models how to deal with others. Lu Zhenxi\u2019s cleverness might deceive the majority of people, but to Ming Yu, it was just like a child\u2019s game.</p><br/><p>Since Zeng Shu had to maintain his model\u2019s rights, he suppressed others. Then this was already a mistake.</p><br/><p>The beautiful youth shook his head, feeling pity for this capable but not smart agent.</p><br/><p>Zeng Shu and Lu Zhenxi left, while Brother Yuan, A\u2019Zhao and the others didn\u2019t quite understand the situation to the end. Butt here were one thing that they knew: Xi Ze was standing before them right now!</p><br/><p>A\u2019Xue was a diehard Xi Ze fan. She entered the company six months ago, but this was her first time seeing the god in person. The already excited A\u2019Xue hurriedly grabbed a pen and paper to get Xi Ze\u2019s signature, then waited with an excited face.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze handed them back to the girl and smiled. \u201cToday, I heard that Ming Yu was here. I have something to say to him, so I came over. Tonight\u2019s dinner is my treat. You can go to Ruoshang Hall for a free meal. But Ming Yu\u2026 I have to take him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The deathly loyal A\u2019Xue raised her hands. \u201cGood good, anything you say is good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026This excited appearance, it seemed to be saying: \u2018Ming Xiaoyu, do you need me to help you pack anything?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled and turned away with Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>The two people left the training room. Then Ming Yu stopped and raised his left hand. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to let go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man heard this and looked like he was waking up from a dream. His eyebrows raised with surprise and he said, \u201cI unexpectedly forgot.\u201d Xi Ze gently released Ming Yu\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>The youth stretched his muscles and the two people talked while walking towards the elevator.</p><br/><p>The evening clouds were magnificent, bathing the figure of the two in a dream-like cherry red light. As they walked through the glass corridor, a cool breeze blew from a gap in the windows, causing the youth\u2019s hair to become chaotic.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu tucked his hair behind his ear and smiled lightly. \u201cXi Ze, I didn\u2019t think I would see you again so soon.\u201d He paused and asked, \u201cI have been listening to Sister Wei. Aren\u2019t you busy lately with Ji and Ya? Don\u2019t you have to prepare for next year\u2019s fashion show?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

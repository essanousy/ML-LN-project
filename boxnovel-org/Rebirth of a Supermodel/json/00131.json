His delicate eyebrows and brow looked very relaxed and he had a casual and natural appearance. However, this face was very pale and his lip color was light. It was like there was no blood.</p><br/><p>His right hand was even more terrible. The thick gauze was wrapped around it and it was completely invisible. However, Ming Xiaoyu had inadvertently taken it from a side position and a little bit of red blood could be seen on the back of his hand.</p><br/><p>My god! How deep was the wound that there were still traces of bleeding despite such tight bandaging?</p><br/><p>\u3010QAQ, Mushroom lick lick lick. Mushroom, does it hurt? If you are in pain then call this sister=3= \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ming Xiaoyu really only hurt his hand? I don\u2019t believe it! Mushroom, don\u2019t be afraid to say it. You hit the wall so hard, how can you only hurt one hand? \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 I am asking Ming Xiaoyu for a full body photo! I will worry if I don\u2019t see it! That Jiang broke a leg but your whole body was smashed. How can only your hand be hurt? Mushroom, don\u2019t be afraid. I will lick you so that there is no pain. \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the style of the sister fans. For the female banknote fans and the wife fans:</p><br/><p>\u3010 Ahhhhh QAQ! My Small Mushroom\u2019s hand! My Small Mushroom\u2019s tender hands!! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Hand! What is happening with his hand? Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s hands are supposed to be white and beautiful! There must be no accidents! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Did my husband really only hurt one hand? \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>Thanks to Ming Yu\u2019s statement, the fans on his Muse forum and Weibo were noisy but they were no longer so worried. Ming Xiaoyu might\u2019ve hurt one hand but at least he had woken up. He might be pale and have a poor complexion but he seemed to be okay. He wasn\u2019t seriously injured.</p><br/><p>Now that they were reassured about Ming Yu\u2019s injuries, his fans started to siege the remnants of Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s fans!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu might not be seriously injured but dirty water was splashed on him by Jiang Kaiyang and his fans!</p><br/><p>This wouldn\u2019t end with just an apology. Jiang Kaiyang had to get out of the entertainment industry!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think that the fans active on Weibo and the major forums were only entertainment fans. In fact, the fans of the fashion industry were no less than the entertainment industry!</p><br/><p>They might not like watching movies or listening to songs, but everyone loved beauty. Everyone wanted to be more dazzling. Thus, they couldn\u2019t help paying attention to the fashion trends and became fashion industry fans.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t fashion trends depend on the magazines, models and fashion shows?</p><br/><p>On the surface, these fans didn\u2019t like being disorderly or express their feelings. But once they reached a critical point, they would all move for the model they loved. They demanded an apology!</p><br/><p>\u3010 #Jiang Kaiyang should leave the entertainment industry# Don\u2019t apologize then leave! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 #Jiang Kaiyang should leave the entertainment industry# He only uses his snake followers. Apologize quickly! \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 #Jiang Kaiyang should leave the entertainment industry# How can you say that you are unconscious when you are the one who caused the accident? I have never seen such a shameless person! Nauseous! Apologize! \u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After the mass rioting of Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s fans, some of the fans who turned their backs on Jiang Kaiyang started speaking.</p><br/><p>\u3010 Anrili is disgusted with Jiang Kaiyang: I feel guilty at the thought of my questioning the fans of a certain person two hours ago. This video is really too truthful and the photo is disgusting. Jiang Kaiyang, I have been a fan of you for a spend and send tens of thousands of yuan on you. Now I will say on behalf of your tens of thousands of fans: Come out and apologize! #Jiang Kaiyang should leave the entertainment industry# \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 Smaller Fish: In the past, there was a meeting for fans and he was clearly someone who was so sunny. How could he be such a person! The picture I see is complete different! A false case, hehe. #Jiang Kaiyang should leave the entertainment industry# \u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010 According to V: I apologize. Previously, I went to the Muse official forum to scold Ming Yu and now I must apologize to the fans. I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have listened to a villain\u2019s words. As for Jiang Kaiyang, let him apologize. #Jiang Kaiyang should leave the entertainment industry# \u3011\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Kaiyang never expected that there would be a nurse who took a photo of him looking at Weibo. He also never expected that someone would take his phone and restrict his personal freedom so that he couldn\u2019t communicate with the outside. He never thought that his agent and company would stay silent on this matter, not speaking a single word to defend him!</p><br/><p>The most unexpected thing for Jiang Kaiyang was that many media brands and marketing accounts expressed their opinions on Weibo and WeChat. Many media organizations wrote articles directly censuring him on their websites! A certain daily newspaper criticized him as \u2018the cancer of the entertainment industry!\u2019</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>Why was everything so big?</p><br/><p>Normally, the media would wait a dozen hours or even a day later than fans to express their public opinion. But in the span of several hours, they suddenly expressed their opinions in a concerted manner and suppressed Jiang Kaiyang.</p><br/><p>So many media organizations spoke up about in a chronological and natural manner. This make Jiang Kaiyang, who was already at a disadvantage, even more disreputable. Even the passersby who didn\u2019t know the details would see this name and unconsciously think he wasn\u2019t a good person.</p><br/><p>In this situation, the voices of the intense fans were drowned out.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, there was an official notice from the An Li crew.</p><br/><p>\u3010 The male number two, Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s performance in An Li is different from the original thoughts of the crew when shooting the related scenes. Therefore, the An Li crew has formally cancelled the contract with Jiang Kaiyang and are willing to pay the relevant fines as compensation. \u3011</p><br/><p>Normally, the cast would be scolded by the celebrity\u2019s fans whenever making such an announcement. If it was different than what they were thinking, what was going on during the audition? This was just an excuse!</p><br/><p>But now no one challenged the decision of the An Li crew.</p><br/><p>Even fools would know that the An Li crew\u2019s announcement had only one purpose: to kick out Jiang Kaiyang.</p><br/><p>First of all, Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s reputation was too smelly. If it was joined together with An Li, there would be no benefit to the movie. Secondly, Jiang Kaiyang was now injured. An Li\u2019s progress was already hurried so how could they specifically wait for him?</p><br/><p>Under these circumstances, the An Li crew made a mercenary choice. But all the onlookers took it for granted. There was only one reason: the person involved was really disgusting!</p><br/><p>In just five or six hours, Jiang Kaiyang changed from being a popular new star to a pseudo-star that everyone hated. This speed was too fast. A few hours ago, his fans were feeling distress and were worried about his body. Now a few hours later, he fell into such a tragic situation.</p><br/><p>In the end, Ming Yu looked at several photographs on Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s phone and stayed silent for a long time. He didn\u2019t take any actions.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze looked at him and asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to send them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu gazed at these photos for a long time before sighing. He forwarded the photos to his own phone before deleting them on the original.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf these photos come ot, he really will die.\u201d Ming Yu handed the phone with the photos removed to Xi Ze. After seeing Xi Ze\u2019s expression, the youth raised his eyebrows and explained. \u201cI don\u2019t feel sorry for him. I just don\u2019t feel the need to do this. He is currently miserable enough. Why make him more miserable? In any case, CX Entertainment has given up on him and also blocked him for five years.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this respect, Xi Ze had no opinion. If Ming Xiaoyu thought it was okay then he thought it was okay.</p><br/><p>However, Xi Ze didn\u2019t notice that Ming Xiaoyu had left himself a trump card. He sent the photos to his own phone and deleted the ones on Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu deeply believed that Jiang Kaiyang didn\u2019t know about the existence of these photos. If he knew, it was absolutely impossible for him to let these photos be stored in the \u2018recently deleted\u2019 list. Instead, he would\u2019ve permanently destroyed them.</p><br/><p>As long as nothing happened in the future, Ming Yu wouldn\u2019t expose these photos to the public. Jiang Kaiyang was a disgusting person and had done something against Ming Yu. However, Ming Xiaoyu was very satisfied with the current results since Jiang Kaiyang received his retribution.</p><br/><p>It was the saying: come out with dirty water, sooner or later it will be returned!</p><br/><p>Since Jiang Kaiyang oppressed and used others, he must be prepared to be bullied and used in return.</p><br/><p>The last hammer in this situation was CX Entertainment\u2019s official announcement.</p><br/><p>The next morning, when everyone had almost forgotten this matter, CX Entertainment published an official announcement on their website and official blog.</p><br/><p>\u3010 This is about CX Entertainment\u2019s artist, Jiang Kaiyang. CX Entertainment has signed with Jiang Kaiyang for ten years and it is now the fourth year. During this period, Jiang Kaiyang and\u2026as above, CX Entertainment will accept the compensation penalty from An Li for Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s cancelled contract. Jiang Kaiyang\u2019s right leg is broken and his mobility is limited. His next schedules have been canceled in order to allow him to recuperate peacefully. His return date is uncertain. \u3011</p><br/><p>This statement was the last bell for Jiang Kaiyang.</p><br/><p>In fact, this matter wasn\u2019t that serious. If the person involved was Fang Liangxiu or Du Ruo, he might\u2019ve not have been forced to this end.</p><br/><p>It was all because the person he offended was Ming Yu, i.e. Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Small Mushroom\u2019s husband.</p><br/><p>Black hearted.</p><br/><p>Narrow-minded.</p><br/><p>Vindictive.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

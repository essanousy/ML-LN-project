The yellow light shone behind Xi Ze, giving him a faint halo.</p><br/><p>After the door opened, the first thing Xi Ze noticed was the fine necklace around MIng Yu\u2019s neck. The necklace was very thin and looked charming against the youth\u2019s clavicle. Only one pendant hung at the end of\u2026it\u2026 a small crystal mushroom.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow when he saw it and asked, \u201cYou still remember about the gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu grinned and nodded from in front of the door. \u201cYes, I remember. I won\u2019t let you in if you don\u2019t have this gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze made a helpless look at the words, but his lips curved upwards. He pretended to think for a long moment before saying, \u201cThen I will cook for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Ming Yu asked, \u201cCan I exchange the gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll close it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu raised a hand to the door handle. How could Xi Ze not know what he meant? Xi Ze sighed and grabbed the youth\u2019s skinny wrist. When Ming Yu didn\u2019t respond, he took a step and officially entered the house, cloasing the door behind him.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026?\uff3f?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c^\uff3f^\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoyu really didn\u2019t want to see the dishes made by Xi Ze. But once Xi Ze entered, he wasn\u2019t mean enough to chase him out. Ming Yu had the idea of \u2018maybe I can watch\u2019 and offered to help in the kitchen. Xi Ze made a look of consideration at Ming Yu\u2019s offer before abruptly entering the kitchen.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xi Ze had been holding a big bag in his left hand when he knocked on the door. However, his hand was covered by the door and Ming Yu didn\u2019t see it. As he pulled out the ingredients from the bag, Ming Yu looked at them one by one and his expression gradually changed from \u201c\uff08\u2299\u2299\uff09\u201d to \u201c\uff08/=\uff3f=\uff09/\uff5e\u2534\u2534\u201d.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu wondered, \u2018What is this? This shrimp, lion head, pork and pieces of meat!!! What do you want to do?\u2019</p><br/><p>As if he perceived the youth\u2019s grief and indignation, the handsome and elegant man calmly removed the shrimp from the preserved box and replied quietly, \u201cOh, today\u2019s time is limited. I will make something simple. For example, braised lion\u2019s head, crystal shrimp, sweet and sour pork\u2026ah, and boiled meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s face turned red as he heard these familiar dishes. But he knew that the man was quietly looking at his flushed face with curved lips.</p><br/><p>The thing that happened next made Ming Yu\u2019s eyes become bigger. It was the first time he received such a big stimulus since his sudden rebirth. It was because he saw that this man could smoothly and skillfully cook!!!</p><br/><p>Vinegar, soy sauce, cooking wine\u2026 these ingredients seemed alive in the man\u2019s hands. As long as he needed them, Xi Ze didn\u2019t even look as he directly picked up the right seasoning and calmly placed them in the pot.</p><br/><p>For example, Ming Yu always got mixed up when he put in sugar. He had to pay careful attention, not putting in too much or two little. But how did Xi Ze do it?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even look as he used a spoon to scoop up sugar!</p><br/><p>The fine white sugar covered the pork tenderloin like snowflakes with a single movement of the man\u2019s wrist. The sweet and sour fragrance soon diffused from the pot to the surrounding area. Ming Xiaoyu smelt it and drooled, but Xi Ze\u2019s leisurely movements didn\u2019t slow down.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze picked up the cooking wine and poured some inside. Ming Xiaoyu was extremely thrilled to find that\u2014</p><br/><p>The pan was on fire!</p><br/><p>\u2026Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s cooking ability might be ordinary, but he still knew it was easy to put alcohol in a pan. The combination of alcohol and fire and could make meat more delicious and authentic. However, this was just a theory. In both his lifetimes, Ming Xiaoyu had never seen any friend do it!</p><br/><p>How could he imagine that this man had such good cooking skills?</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be!</p><br/><p>This was Xi Ze!</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s cooking was delicious? Ming Xiaoyu now believed it.</p><br/><p>Once the crystal shrimp was done, Ming Xiaoyu had already removed the expression of astonishment on his face. He calmly helped Xi Ze by passing over bowls and dishes\u2026 Yes, this was the only help he could give in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you surprised?\u201d Xi Ze asked calmly while holding white soy sauce.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu smiled slightly and nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he not be surprised?</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu saw the man pick up a carrot and small kitchen knife, carving a lifelike flower. The surprise turned to numbness as Ming Yu realized. Xi Ze really had cooked for him when he was sick.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thought of this and couldn\u2019t help asking curiously, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a serious obsession with cleanliness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze placed the crystal shrimp on the plate and said casually, \u201cYou and I are the only ones eating what I cook.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s face was calm with no ups and downs, as if he really was speaking casually without any other meaning. However, Ming Yu was slightly startled. At this moment, Ming Yu felt the intoxication from lunch once again hit his brain.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s lips curves and he felt like laughing as he looked at the man\u2019s tall, upright back. He finally gave a low chuckle and didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui said that Ming Yu\u2019s female skills were top notch?</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu felt that he was a novice compared to this man.</p><br/><p>\u2014Ah Ming Xiaoyu, don\u2019t you know Xi Ze? He only uses this skill on one person. It might be hard to believe, but this is the small mushroom skill!</p><br/><p>There were only four dishes. However, they were as exquisite as those from the best restaurants. The braised lion\u2019s head was rich in sauce and savoury. The excellent taste could be felt just by looking at it. The crystal shrimp was fresh and bright, with some green leaves used (Ming Xiaoyu didn\u2019t really know these types of things). The green leaves were placed around the plate, highlighting the shrimp like stars around the moon.</p><br/><p>In addition to being fragrant and tasty, Xi Ze\u2019s dishes also had impeccable visual beauty.</p><br/><p>If Ming Yu was holding a measuring tape, he would find that all the leaves on the plate were placed at a fixed distance, with the maximum error margin being no more than 3mm. In addition to the man\u2019s paranoia, this type of placement suited his aesthetic requirements.</p><br/><p>Since this arrangement was the most beautiful, it had to be done.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu ate the dishes while full of thoughts. His \u2018I can\u2019t give into evil forces, calm down\u2019 slowly became \u2018How can this dish be so delicious?\u2019. In the end, it changed to the grief-filled \u2018No, how can it be gone? I can still eat 10 bowls of rice.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t move his chopsticks. He ate two random mouthfuls before putting them down on the white porcelain bowl. He crossed his hands, gently supported his chin and stared at the youth with a light smile.</p><br/><p>Once Ming Yu was full, Xi Ze laughed at his satisfied appearance and couldn\u2019t help laughing. Then he asked, \u201cNow that you have eaten, do you want to go see my gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu jerked and responded after a few moments, \u201cYour gift isn\u2019t this meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t want another gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu immediately shook his head. \u201cGo, I want to see your gift!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was almost empty handed. He didn\u2019t bring anything except the big bag of ingredients. Therefore, Ming Yu followed him into the elevator, intending to go to Xi Ze\u2019s apartment to see the so-called gift.</p><br/><p>A long time ago, Xi Ze told Ming Yu that his apartment was on the top floor of this building. He didn\u2019t say that his apartment was on the top floor, but that the entire top floor was his apartment.</p><br/><p>The house was as clean, simple and stylish as Ming Yu once envisioned.</p><br/><p>There were only three colours in the whole house: black, white and blue. The luxurious and sophisticated black, the concise and pure white and the charming blue, these three colours merged together to form a wonderful visual effect. Of course, the main colours were black and white, with only a handful of blue tones scattered in between to play the role of icing on the cake.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to the cloakroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze didn\u2019t disturb him while Ming Yu was looking around the house. But once he saw the youth\u2019s failure to take another step, Xi Ze immediately laughed, took the youth\u2019s hand and walked towards a room.</p><br/><p>Once the door was opened, Ming Yu was completely startled.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t talk about just the fashion industry. Many outsiders and ordinary people wanted to design a cloakroom or dressing room like this. In his last life, Ming Yu\u2019s cloakroom contained various clothing, watches, perfumes and shoes that he obtained since his debut. It was a dazzling sight and his friends once praised it as a \u2018fashion paradise.\u2019</p><br/><p>In this life, the Muse apartment was too small and Ming Yu didn\u2019t design a cloakroom. But the new place he bought was being renovated. After he moved in, there would be a big cloakroom waiting for him.</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu was very confident of his future and designed the cloakroom to be very large. He thought he wouldn\u2019t need to change it for at least five years. However, it was just a drop in a bucket compared with the cloakroom in front of him.</p><br/><p>This cloakroom had two floors. Ming Yu hadn\u2019t noticed that there was a loft on the top floor of the Muse apartment building. The loft was directly above the designed cloakroom, creating a two-storey design.</p><br/><p>On the left side of the cloakroom, all of the men\u2019s high fashion clothing was arranged. On the right side of the cloakroom, there were men\u2019s jackets, ranging from elegant suit jackets to long trench coats, arranged in their respective order. Ming Yu\u2019s eyes widened at the sight and he didn\u2019t know how to react.</p><br/><p>The three large glass cabinets in the centre of the room contained watches, collar clips and cuffs. On the opposite wall was a full row of shoes, from leather shoes to leather boots, the elegant leather shining under the bright lights.</p><br/><p>But seeing this, Ming Yu suddenly thought about something. \u201cI remember, this isn\u2019t your main house?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze nodded. \u201cYes, it is a set.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu asked, \u201cThen in your other house, there is a cloakroom like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze smiled at the \u2018You don\u2019t have to say it or I will kill you on behalf of the readers\u2019 Ming Xiaoyu and nodded, \u201cWell, basically. The room in the villa is a little bigger than this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>He really wanted to represent the people and wipe out these wicked rich people!</p><br/><p>Since Xi Ze brought Ming Yu upstairs, he naturally had a gift for him. This gift wasn\u2019t just a good meal.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was stunned when he saw the beautiful clothing, turning to look at Xi Ze with a questioning gaze. Xi Ze nodded in confirmation and said, \u201cI am giving this high-end set to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a pause, he added, \u201cI had some inspiration since I drew you. Thus, I made two sets of clothing, one male and one female. Maybe you can see it in the next Ji and Ya high-end fashion show.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

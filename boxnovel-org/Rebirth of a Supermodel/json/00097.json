He didn\u2019t know how he could suddenly encounter both of them, but a few words suddenly flashed through Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s head\u2014</p><br/><p>Meeting on a narrow road, the brave would win.</p><br/><p>\u2026Cough! This was Zhao Rui and Luo Ru, not enemies.</p><br/><p>After all, Ming Xiaoyu and Xi Ze had left the room and acted like ordinary friends, so there was nothing strange. They didn\u2019t look unusual and normal people wouldn\u2019t think too much. Even if someone said hello to Xi Ze and Ming Yu on the way, they wouldn\u2019t think anything was wrong.</p><br/><p>But for Zhao Rui and Luo Ru, it was really abnormal.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s face was stiff as he inwardly thought, \u2018Did Xi Ze attend the Nidelan May fashion show? I heard from A\u2019Wei that Xi Ze doesn\u2019t participate in the activities of brands he hasn\u2019t worked with for a long time. Why did he suddenly attend Nidelan\u2019s show?\u2019 By the way, Zhao Rui also remembered that Ming Xiaoyu once said he gave Xi Ze toilet paper.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Luo Ru was aware of the slightest detail.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru was an intelligent and sharp woman, with sharp observation abilities. She also had the meticulous thoughts of a female character and noticed the nuances. For example, why did she feel that Ming Yu and Xi Ze were standing too close?</p><br/><p>They might be friends, but the corridor was so wide while their bodies were so close\u2026 it felt weird!</p><br/><p>However, neither Zhao Rui or Luo Ru revealed the many thoughts on their minds in front of Xi Ze.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui coughed and said hello to Mr. Xi. Then he turned to Ming Yu and asked, \u201cXiaoyu, you have changed your clothes and removed your makeup? Luo Ru and I have dealt with matters here. We can go directly back to the hotel.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu nodded at this. Then Xi Ze spoke calmly from the sidelines. \u201cI\u2019m planning on inviting Ming Yu to go to Italy to see Garcia\u2019s studio. It will probably take around a week. Does Ming Yu have any jobs he must attend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui was startled by Xi Ze\u2019s words. Then he subconsciously replied, \u201cNo\u2026there are no jobs in the next week.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze nodded while a light flashed through his dark eyes. Then he turned to the youth beside him. \u201cDo you want to go to Garcia? My friend is an assistant designer there and they are currently making high-end dresses for the second half of the year.\u201d</p><br/><p>A lot of information flashed through Ming Yu\u2019s mind when he heard the name \u2018Garcia.\u2019 Ming Yu didn\u2019t have the slightest hesitation as he nodded. He looked at Zhao Rui and asked, \u201cBrother Zhao, when must I return to Huaxia?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui immediately replied, \u201cTwo weeks, you have up to two weeks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu nodded at these words and then said to Luo Ru, \u201cSister Luo, I will go to Italy with Xi Ze. If anything comes up, you or Brother Zhao can call me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu thoughts about matters and felt more assured trusting them to Luo Ru.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru stared at the youth with a complicated expression before agreeing. \u201cOkay, I understand Xiaoyu.\u201d</p><br/><p>The series of events took place very quickly. From Zhao Rui and Luo Ru\u2019s appearance, to Xi Ze\u2019s appearance and then organizing matters, a total of only five minutes passed. Yet Zhao Rui felt like he had experienced a long period of time.</p><br/><p>\u2026How could the world change so fast and be completely different from what he imagined?</p><br/><p>The four people walked towards the entrance of the venue. They arrived at the parking lot and watched their small model follow Xi Ze. Zhao Rui couldn\u2019t help it and suddenly pulled Ming Xiaoyu to the side, whispering, \u201cXiaoyu, your friendship with Mr. Xi\u2026is it really this good?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s eyebrows raised as the words and he smiled, \u201cBrother Zhao, my relationship with Xi Ze is very good. This time you can rest assured that he won\u2019t betray me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, \u201c\u2026#\uff04\uff05#\uff04\uff05#\uff04#!\u201d</p><br/><p>Where was he thinking that Xi Ze would betray Xiaoyu?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t there something weird here?</p><br/><p>Was Xi Ze really such an enthusiastic person? Zhao Rui felt there was something wrong!</p><br/><p>Once Ming Xiaoyu and Xi Ze walked in the other direction of the parking lot, Zhao Rui looked after them with a puzzled expression and muttered, \u201cHow can it feel so strange?\u201d By his side, Luo Ru didn\u2019t speak. She stared with narrowed eyes at the backs of the two tall men.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru stared for 10 seconds when Ming Xiaoyu quietly looked sideways at her and smiled. The smile was gentle, but contained a deep meaning hidden it in. Luo Ru\u2019s eyes widened and she covered her mouth, not daring to exclaim aloud.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui didn\u2019t see this scene. He was already preparing to drive.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s car was a little further away. After arriving at the venue, he had sent his driver back and planned to drive the car himself.</p><br/><p>If Ming Xiaoyu came to Europe, it was natural to rent a car as a means of transport. For those like Xi Ze, who often flew around the world, they would have their own real estate in major cities where they could live at any time, not to mention cars.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s car wasn\u2019t indifferent and cold like him. Rather, it was a gorgeous red Ferrari. The chassis is very low, almost wiping the ground, while the body was beautiful and streamlined. It was wild and exciting, with a crazy and unrestrained heroic style.</p><br/><p>After getting in the car, Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know, but much money do you have in the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was a top supermodel in his previous life and his assets were estimated to be in the eight digits. But he wasn\u2019t extravagant enough to buy a million-dollar sports car in London. Xi Ze was born gifted. His main business wasn\u2019t modelling but designing. Therefore, it was natural he would have more money than Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s previous life.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze pressed a button while listening to Ming Yu\u2019s question and asked, \u201cThis question, are you planning to be the housekeeper of our house in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu raised an eyebrow, \u201cI am the housekeeper? Then I\u2019m not the home owner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to be the home owner?\u201d Xi Ze placed a hand on the steering wheel while staring into Ming Yu\u2019s eyes with a smile.</p><br/><p>The young man spread open his hands and said, \u201cI thought I was already.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s eyes stared at the youth for a long time at these words. But the latter\u2019s lips just calmly curved up as he waited. Nobody would understand how much pressure Ming Xiaoyu was withstanding at this moment under his calm surface.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s pressure wasn\u2019t comparable to others. Faced with this question of who was the \u2018owner\u2019, Xi Ze didn\u2019t recognize Ming Xiaoyu as the home owner at first. He just quietly stared at the youth.</p><br/><p>But Ming Yu wouldn\u2019t be Ming Yu if he succumbed.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Xi Ze\u2019s eyes curved as he smiled. Then he sighed and kissed a corner of the youth\u2019s lips. \u201cSmall Mushroom, no one has probably said it before but you are really bad and cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu glanced coldly at the man beside him. \u201cDefinitely not. If anyone calls me \u2018Small Mushroom\u2019 then they would no longer have a chance to\u2026hey, what are you doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu hadn\u2019t finished speaking when Xi Ze slammed on the pedal and the top sports car instantly accelerated!</p><br/><p>It was so fast that Ming Yu fell back in his seat. He was so angry that his eyes became moist, really looking like a small mushroom.</p><br/><p>The main culprit, Mr. Xi drove calmly out of the parking lot and into the sparsely populated road of the eastern suburbs of London. The car was very fast and Xi Ze\u2019s driving skills so good that Ming Yu could only feel admiration. Several gorgeous drifts made Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes widen and he could only look at the man beside him with a horrified gaze\u2014</p><br/><p>How many things did this man have?</p><br/><p>\u2026No, that wasn\u2019t it! How many things was this man good at?</p><br/><p>After adapting to the other person\u2019s amazing driving skills, Ming Xiaoyu said, \u201cI finally understand why you let other people drive. If an ordinary person sits in your car, I\u2019m afraid they would throw themselves into the sea and not want to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze acted like he didn\u2019t hear the true meaning of the youth\u2019s words. He nodded and agreed, \u201cYes, my driving skills are really high and ordinary people can\u2019t sit in my car. Only my family\u2019s owner can sit here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu raised an eyebrow, \u201cAre you admitting it Mr. Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze\u2019s thin lips slightly curved as he replied calmly, \u201cYes, you gave me toilet paper and solved my urgent situation. No matter what you say, I must admit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026!!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

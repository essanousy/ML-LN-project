The original script had the teenager bow his head, letting the female teacher give him a comforting kiss. The script wanted to express that the youth fell in love with the female teacher, letting her live.</p><br/><p>But this plot was revised a few days ago after Ming Yu had a discussion with the director. Ming Yu and Zhu Kejia\u2019s analysis was the same. Such an indifferent and antisocial teenager, how could he fall in love at first glance with the female teacher?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t kill her, but he couldn\u2019t fall in love with her.</p><br/><p>Thus, after talking with the director, the script was changed and everyone got a new script. However, Ming Yu\u2019s script had a lot of important notes written on it. Rather than replacing it with a new script, he used a black pen to make the contents of the new script onto a blank space.</p><br/><p>Having said that, even in the original script, the youth shouldn\u2019t be the one kissing the female teacher!!!</p><br/><p>Ming Yu pushed the man away, wiping at his forehead while seriously saying, \u201cYour acting is really bad. The whole scene collapsed.\u201d He paused before continuing. \u201cFortunately, you are a model and not an actor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze watched the youth wiping his forehead and raised an eyebrow. This sentence was a little familiar?</p><br/><p>The person who got NGs 20 times was actually criticizing him for poor acting. Xi Ze didn\u2019t get angry. He just raised his hands and asked, \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu righteously said, \u201cOf course, you made a mistake! I had a few lines of this scene crossed out, with the new plot marked next to it. The previous plot wasn\u2019t in the script at all. The teenager just hugged the female teacher and there was no comforting kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was surprised when he heard this and exclaimed, \u201cYour marking isn\u2019t good. I didn\u2019t see this story at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You didn\u2019t see that big scratch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze replied sincerely. \u201cI think it was an emphasis mark.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu, \u201c\u2026 (/=_=)/~\u2534\u2534\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would put an emphasis in the middle of the world!!</p><br/><p>Out of consideration, Ming Yu didn\u2019t go deeper into the problem. He was vaguely aware of something, but when he looked up at Xi Ze, the latter was looking at him indifferently. There was no sweating or agitation at all, like he was really telling the truth.</p><br/><p>\u2026No matter how Ming Yu ignored it, he knew that when the other person\u2019s lips touched him, his heartbeat became rapid and his ears somewhat hot. If someone was to carefully observe his ears right now, they would find that it was still a bright red, the heat not subsiding at all.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu lightly coughed twice and suppressed this strange feeling in his heart. He temporarily decided not to think about it. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t notice Xi Ze looking down at him for a long time. Due to their height, Ming Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t see Xi Ze\u2019s eyes, but the latter could completely see him.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze chose not to point out the slight shyness that was visible under Ming Yu\u2019s calm appearance. His lips just curved in a meaningful manner before pretending he didn\u2019t know anything.</p><br/><p>Boiling a frog in warm water, even if it was heated once a day, it should be cooked at least 60~70% right?</p><br/><p>It was also time to make some moves other than \u2018often send text messages\u2019 and \u2018occasionally meet.\u2019</p><br/><p>As a result, the two people were \u2018ghostly\u2019 silent. After a while, Ming Yu took the initiative to cook Xi Ze a bowl of noodles (yes, not instant noodles! A real bowl of noodles!). In this period of time, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s cooking had greatly improved. His fans had long been unable to stand their god \u2018can\u2019t even make tomato scrambled eggs.\u2019 Thus, in one part of his Muse official forum, there was a red post that was never allowed to sink\u2014</p><br/><p>[365 days, I call Ming Xiaoyu to eat this!]</p><br/><p>Every day, there were caring fans who would post their cooking recipes, including details of what to pay attention to. At first, they just wanted Ming Xiaoyu to stop eating nonsense like his tomato scrambled eggs. But slowly, more fans who loved to cook came together and threw Ming Xiaoyu to the side\u2026 cough, it became a group to exchange their cooking experience.</p><br/><p>Even so, Ming Yu learned something from it. He couldn\u2019t cook braised lion head (stewed meatballs) or boiled meat, but wasn\u2019t a bowl of noodles okay? Just sprinkle some green onion and pepper, pour the sesame oil and pull out a bow of fragrant yang chun noodles.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze was surprised when he saw this bowl of noodles. It was a world of difference compared to the instant noodles from New Year\u2019s Eve!</p><br/><p>As if he sensed the other person\u2019s surprise, Ming Xiaoyu put on a calm demeanor and said, \u201cIt is too bad I am busy today. Otherwise, I could cook braised lion\u2019s head, boiled meat, crystal shrimp or sweet and sour pork.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze calmly replied, \u201cOh?\u201d I remember that you still owe a favour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was surprised at the words. A hint of a bad feeling flashed through his head.</p><br/><p>He could only listen as Xi Ze said, \u201cThen you should cook braised lion\u2019s head, boiled meat, crystal shrimp and sweet and sour pork for me. Then I will consider this favour returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026\uff08\u2519&gt;\u2227&lt;\uff09\u2519\u3078\u253b\u253b\u201d</p><br/><p>Alas, why did he say those words?</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t an upright person and was hit by thunder!</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, how could you say such narcissitic things?</p><br/><p>Things were settled for the moment, so Ming Yu and Xi Ze sat the table eating the noodles. It was slippery but both people didn\u2019t make a sound. Xi Ze was always elegant and calm, so it was impossible for him to make sound when eating. On the other side, Ming Xiaoyu looked at the script and only ate a few handfuls as he occasionally picked up the pend to write something.</p><br/><p>The fourth time this happened, Xi Ze gently put down the chopsticks and sighed. \u201cIf you use the feelings that I just showed, there should be no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu shook his head because he was very self-aware. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand my acting. If I don\u2019t carefully figure out every detail, there might be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I just want to have a quiet meal with you\u2026</p><br/><p>Since the meal couldn\u2019t continue, Xi Ze chose to stand up and go to Ming Yu in order to give some advice. As he walked, he said, \u201cYou should pay attention to your eyes and the movement of the corners of your mouth. When saying the lines just now\u2026the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu raised his head, \u201c\uff08\u2299\uff1f\u2299\uff09\u201d Why wasn\u2019t he saying anything?</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>What is with these words? No\u2026 they weren\u2019t words!!</p><br/><p>In the clean notebook, seven or eight earthworm-like characters unexpectedly appeared. These characters! It was like a knife. The visual was enough to cause shock!</p><br/><p>Even the calm Xi Ze was petrified in place!</p><br/><p>A long time passed and Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s face was like \u201c\uff08\uffe3o\uffe3\uff09\u201d. Xi Ze finally recovered from seeing this handwriting. He turned to look at the young man next to him. He wanted to speak, but it was like he couldn\u2019t find an exit or know where to start.</p><br/><p>\u2026It was too much, Xi Ze couldn\u2019t understand it, let alone the readers.</p><br/><p>Before he saw Ming Yu\u2019s writing, he didn\u2019t think the youth would write\u2026such\u2026earth-shattering characters.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze secretly looked at the five year contract signed by Ming Yu and saw the youth\u2019s signature. The signature wasn\u2019t pretty, but it could be considered serious and average.</p><br/><p>Later, Ming Yu\u2019s signature became more elegant. Like Fei Sixin said, Ming Xiaoyu\u2019s signature was really good looking, he had certainly received professional training and practiced the signature.</p><br/><p>Fei Sixin\u2019s guess was right.</p><br/><p>In Ming Yu\u2019s precious life, the industry didn\u2019t pay attention to the models\u2019 manners, but a signature was something that was often required. Ming Xiaoyu thought his words were straight edged and big, but his agent made an unspeakable expression and invited a special calligraphy master to design \u2018Ming Yu\u2019s\u2019 signature. Then he was forced to practice it for several months before obtaining such a cloud-like signature.</p><br/><p>In other words\u2026 the agent thought it was too helpless \u256e\uff08\u256f\uff3f\u2570\uff09\u256d. Xi Ze stared at Ming Yu for a long time and suddenly asked, \u201cYour signature doesn\u2019t look like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Xiaoyu, \u201c\u2026Ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ze demanded. \u201cSign your name for me. It shouldn\u2019t be what I remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the Ji and Ya fashion show, Ming Yu had left his name on the signature wall. Many models and actors practiced their signature after their debut, so when Xi Ze saw his signature, it wasn\u2019t strange that he thought \u2018Why is it different from the contract three years ago?\u2019</p><br/><p>His muse, he was really good in every aspect. Oh, apart from acting.</p><br/><p>And now\u2026</p><br/><p>Ming Yu placed his pen on top of the notebook and wrote out a fierce and sharp \u2018Ming Yu\u2019, looking exactly the same as the signature on the wall.</p><br/><p>Xi Ze, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this the legendary \u2018golden on the outside, shabby on the inside?\u2019\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

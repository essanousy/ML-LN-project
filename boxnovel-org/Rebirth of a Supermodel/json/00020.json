He didn\u2019t really feel it, but Zhao Rui was well aware of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past two days, the number of gifts sent to the company has increased and the fans on your official website and weibo are also rising!\u201d Zhao Rui showed the IPad while speaking emotionally, \u201cMing Yu, you are really popular! Remember to wear a mask and sunglasses when you go out later. Don\u2019t get in trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu put down the magazine after hearing this and looked at his agent with a dumbfounded expression. \u201cBrother Zhao, when have you every seen me without a mask when going out? This is Beijing, I really can\u2019t live if I don\u2019t wear a mask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s voice faded, while a woman finished going through the materials and said with a laugh. \u201cMing Yu, be careful. I remember that you have a little allergic rhinitis, remember to always bring a medicine spray with you. There is more likely to be an outbreak of rhinitis on hazy days, so be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Sister Luo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The company had assigned Luo Ru as Ming Yu\u2019s assistant two days ago. Although she was just an assistant, Luo Ru\u2019s strategist demeanor and calm way of speaking impressed Zhao Rui, who allowed her to participate in some of Ming Yu\u2019s activities.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru was a woman with long hair who wore it in a ponytail. She wore silver glasses and always wore a decent traditional suit, unlike the models and agents. For example, Zhao Rui wore casual clothing. Luo Ru seemed more like a white-collar elite who worked nine to five.</p><br/><p>At this moment, she was sorting through the invitations sent to Ming Yu. Some of them were distributed by the company, but most were directly sent by the company involved. Since Ming Yu had gained a bit of fame, the company raised his rank to the second-tier. There were even many fashion magazines and entertainment shows that threw him an olive branch.</p><br/><p>However, Ming Yu was still in the early stages so the invitations were of varying quality, requiring careful selection by Zhao Rui and Luo Ru. After an afternoon of careful selection, Zhao Rui held two notices and hesitated. \u201cThe small supporting role in the movie means you can enter the entertainment industry, but this talk show is also not bad. It is really difficult to choose.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fashion industry and entertainment industry seemed unrelated, but they were actually inextricably linked.</p><br/><p>For example, Wu Yuzhen played the guest role of a small police officer in a movie and got the nickname of \u2018Sir Wu\u2019, resulting in more fans in the fashion industry.</p><br/><p>But in general, it was rare for someone to work actively in both fields. After all, it required a lot of energy as well as talent. A supermodel didn\u2019t necessarily have superb acting, while a movie actor might not be able to control his aura on the catwalk.</p><br/><p>Wu Yuzhen succeed, but since then, he never accepted any TV series or movie invitations. He solely devoted himself to the fashion industry. Ming Yu\u2019s status was lower than Wu Yuzhen\u2019s at that time, and he knew that there was some risk in entering the entertainment industry.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu thought for a moment after hearing Zhao Rui\u2019s words and asked, \u201cBrother Zhao, what type of role is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru directly replied. \u201cIt is a suspense movie. A group of young people courted disaster and called a spirit. They died one by one, leaving only the heroine alive. She paused before adding. \u201cThe movie side invited you to play the role of the first person who dies in the school. This movie has a small budget and your image is good. The compensation isn\u2019t high, but it is a good choice for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu couldn\u2019t help laughing after hearing this. He raised his hand and asked, \u201cCan I know if this is the first \u2018Spirit Calling\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru and Zhao Rui were surprised because Ming Yu bluntly said the movie name \u2018Spirit Calling.\u2019 After a moment, Zhao Rui replied, \u201cThis is the fifth. The director has previously directed four Spirit Callings. The first box office result was good, but the others fell flat.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu realized that it was nothing more than a series of movies. The director\u2019s mind:</p><br/><p>The first movie: \u201cTake a story no one has made. How about calling a spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second movie: \u201cWow, the first box office result was so high! Let\u2019s make a second one!\u201d</p><br/><p>The third movie: \u201cThe box office might be a bit lower than before, but I am familiar with this story. Continue to shoot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth movie: \u201c\u2026Shoot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth movie: \u201cNo, I have a breaktrhough! Simply find handsome people and focus on the face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Huaxia\u2019s suspense horror movies were fundamentally unchanged in this world, so Ming Yu knew all about it. He was a horror movie enthusiast. Unfortunately, Huaxia\u2019s horror movies were a bit scary but didn\u2019t have enough bloody stimulation. Meanwhile, the European and American horror movies were bloody, but there wasn\u2019t enough suspense.</p><br/><p>Of course, to put it plainly, Ming Yu had played an important supporting role in a movie in his previous life.</p><br/><p>Nobody was perfect. Ming Yu might\u2019ve been the unique top male model of China at that time, but his acting skill was unacceptable. The movie peeled a layer of skin of Ming Yu and strengthened his determination not to go into acting.</p><br/><p>And now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhao, I think the talk show is good.\u201d Ming Yu smiled at his agent and assistant and explained. \u201cThe series of movies won\u2019t expand my popularity that much, so the compensation isn\u2019t worth it. The talk show is the opposite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui nodded. \u201cI think so as well. But do you really not want to cameo in a movie to increase your popularity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu firmly shook his head. \u201cRight now, I am still in the early stages and don\u2019t see the need to cross industries. SIster Luo, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru gently nodded and expressed her approval.</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui no longer tried to persuade him. Ming Yu\u2019s words made sense and Zhao Rui had no opinion. Thus, it was decided that Ming Yu would go on a talk show after the Pei Feng fashion show.</p><br/><p>Three days later was the official opening of Pei Feng\u2019s autumn fashion show. During this period, Ming Yu had nothing to do. However, he kept up his energy by watching Cheng Su\u2019s many catwalks. From his debut to when he became popular, Ming Yu looked at Cheng Su growing step by step until he became a large tree.</p><br/><p>Cheng Su had a bit of talent and was clever, but he also knew how to grab opportunities. These types of people would become popular.</p><br/><p>Everything was reasonable.</p><br/><p>Pei Feng\u2019s official autumn fashion show of 2016 dawned. Luo Ru arrived early in the morning and took Ming Yu to the venue. It was still dawn, but Luo Ru took into account the potential traffic jam. They arrived at the hall at Beijing\u2019s Fifth Ring Road at exactly 8 o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>As a model in the show, Ming Yu walked directly through the side door, allowing him to miss the reporters blocking the main entrance. Zhao Rui had already been waiting at the venue for some time. After seeing that Ming Yu arrived, he directed Ming Yu to the dressing room.</p><br/><p>This time, Ming Yu\u2019s make-up artist wasn\u2019t Xiao Chen. All of Pei Feng\u2019s first-tier make-up artists were present. They were skilled, allowing the same smoky make-up to have different effects on each model\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The female make-up artist waited until Ming Yu\u2019s make-up was finished before smiling and shaking hands with him. \u201cXiao Chen is my apprentice. He told me about you. Ming Yu, thank you for taking care of him last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was slightly startled by the words, before smiling gently. \u201cIt is Brother Chen who took care of me, Sister Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s gentle and soft smile caused Sister Zheng to be slightly startled. Ming Yu was turning to go when she suddenly stopped him. He looked at her with surprised eyes and she said, \u201cMing Yu, if you don\u2019t mind, can I add a mole on you? Looking at the overall feeling of your make-up, I think the effect will be better if a mole was added.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu was familiar with the overall aspects of modelling, but he wasn\u2019t a master when it came to make-up. Sister Zheng had served as Pei Feng\u2019s make-up artist for many years, so she naturally would have siperior vision. Therefore, Ming Yu calmly accepted Sister Zheng\u2019s proposal, allowing her to gently draw a mole under his right eye.</p><br/><p>It was just a seemingly simple mole, but it made Luo Ru look stunned.</p><br/><p>Before leaving the dressing room with Ming Yu, Luo Ru solemnly handed her business card to Sister Zheng.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Rui came with his clothes, he also looked slightly shocked when he saw Ming Yu. Zhao Rui asked, \u201cWho gave you the mole? It feels so different! Ming Yu, this make-up artist\u2019s skills are really superb. It is the same smoky make-up as last time, but you feel quite different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu naturally looked in the mirror to check his current appearance. Therefore, he laughed when he heard Zhao Rui\u2019s words. \u201cSister Zheng is a very powerful make-up artist.\u201d He paused and turned to Luo Ruo. \u201cSister Luo, just now, you gave your business card to Sister Zheng right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ru suddenly stared at his words. After a long moment, she nodded. \u201cYes, I gave her a business card.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu didn\u2019t speak again and Luo Ru no longer answered.</p><br/><p>As Luo Rui made arrangements with the Pei Feng people about the final catwalk plan, Ming Yu looked between Luo Ru and Zhao Rui before slightly narrowing his eyes.</p><br/><p>Luo Ru, this person was extremely smart and she had various methods. How could the company arrange such a smart person to be his assistant? If this person was given the chance, she could definitely become a first-tier agent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yu, what are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui\u2019s voice suddenly interrupted Ming Yu\u2019s thoughts. Ming Yu turned to look at his own stupid but good agent and sighed deeply. Luo Ru was a newcomer and was already capable of being first-tier. Meanwhile, his own agent had been in the fashion industry for four or five years. Not only did he not know how to establish a network of first hand connections, he was actually worse than Luo Ru\u2026</p><br/><p>Was this the \u2018silly\u2019 blessing that silly people had?</p><br/><p>Zhao Rui, who had the \u2018silly blessing\u2019 was seriously urging him. \u201cMing Yu, the rehearsals will begin soon. You have walked a show for more than six months, so pay attention to finding the right feeling. The clothing doesn\u2019t drag and it is easy to walk, but you have to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shortly after a quick rehearsal, the afternoon fashion show would officially open.</p><br/><p>At this time, a handsome and upright man got out of a luxurious European car in front of the huge entrance of the venue. He waited for the other man to get out of the car and they walked together towards the door.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If Big Brother finds out, Yiling has done all of this for Big Brother and Sister-in-Law, so\u2026 don\u2019t let Big Brother punish me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Had she planned all of this from the start? It was clear that Yiling had wanted to do this but was afraid that Baili Yu would get angry at her and punish her, that was why she had dragged her into it.</p><br/><p>And Yiling had planned out things perfectly so that she would agree. Although she had agreed against her will earlier, Yiling probably would\u2019ve gotten her to agree even without that trick.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Yiling will unseal your movements now and then we\u2019ll secretly go help Big Brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she unsealed Tang Doudou\u2019s pressure points.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me your plan first, otherwise I\u2019ll leave by myself and won\u2019t ever go back to look for Baili Yu.\u201d Tang Doudou knew that if she was going to stay with Baili Yiling, this little fox, she had to take the initiative to seize the upper hand. Otherwise, it was very possible for her to be trolled and sold out mercilessly.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling curved her eyes in amusement. It seemed she hadn\u2019t expected Tang Doudou to suddenly become smart and even try to threaten her.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this sister-in-law of hers knew more than to just act cute!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You won\u2019t agree? Then I\u2019m leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, Sister-in-Law, don\u2019t be so impatient!\u201d Baili Yiling hastily grabbed Tang Doudou and said, \u201cYiling will tell you, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen start.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is quite a long story, so why don\u2019t we walk as I tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Baili Yiling pulled her inside, she was walking really fast so they couldn\u2019t even see the light from outside anymore. However, they could still faintly hear the sounds of battle coming from outside. The disturbance was very loud, so Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but worry about Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen first tell me what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling smiled. \u201cOf course we\u2019re going to dig through Lan Jia\u2019s place to find something that can help Big Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>What would Lan Jia have that could help Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Big Brother\u2019s skill in martial arts, even if Lan Jia was ten times stronger than he usually was, he still wouldn\u2019t be a match for Big Brother, so we don\u2019t need to worry about Big Brother\u2019s safety right now. Rather than hang around, we should take advantage of this chance to search Lan Jia\u2019s hidden rooms for the antidotes to the Hoarfrost Poison and Disseminating Tassel Fragrance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling\u2019s words gave Tang Doudou a pleasant surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that Lan Jia has the antidote to the Hoarfrost Poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! This poison was something he had brought out from that strange place. For the sake of cultivating this sort of poison blood, he killed so many people of his own blood and flesh and caused the deaths of countless innocents\u2026 Even if we can\u2019t find the antidote in the hidden room, we should still destroy the method to produce poison blood in order to save future generations from this fate!\u201d Baili Yiling spat these words between gritted teeth. It was clear that she hated Lan Jia from the bottom of her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a shame that although I learned a lot of useful tricks over the years, I\u2019m not good at martial arts. Otherwise, I\u2019d personally kill Lan Jia, that bastard and avenge Mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I have no choice but to allow Big Brother to do it. However\u2026 he\u2019s still Big Brother\u2019s father! Will Big Brother really have to kill his own father\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If Baili Yu really did, he would probably have to endure the pain for the rest of his life\u2026</p><br/><p>It was no wonder he insisted on her leaving.</p><br/><p>He probably didn\u2019t want her to see his pain and weakness.</p><br/><p>He wanted to endure all the pain by himself and was only willing to show her a comforting and warm smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law, don\u2019t worry. Big Brother, He- He\u2019s already used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYiling, when did he find you? Why does it feel like you know each other really well?\u201d If she wanted to get to know Baili Yu\u2019s true feelings, she had to do it slowly, and start with the people by his side. She wanted to share all his emotions, not just his shield of a smile.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t find me, I was the one that found him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter Big Brother came to Cerulean Mountain, I started thinking of ways to approach him. I helped him cure the grub poison that Lan Jia had planted on him, then brought him to the stone room Mother had stayed in before she died\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem very familiar with Cerulean Mountain. Could it be that you\u2019ve been here this entire time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That year, after Madame Qing brought me to Cerulean Mountain, Grandpa Gui switch me with another girl. I stayed in Cerulean Mountain and Grandpa Gui sent Lan Jia\u2019s daughter to Wind Cloud Island, thus completing the task Lan Jia had given him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou never expected for there to be so many twists in this matter. She had really been too sheltered to actually have been unaware of all of this.</p><br/><p>She rubbed her thumb ring. She wasn\u2019t Li Xueyi, so she couldn\u2019t help but wonder how much Li Xueyi had been able to find out.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that Li Xueyi had been collecting the Green Bone Phoenix Lamps. She had probably found out that her birth parents were involved with the Saint Tribes. In addition, who exactly was that black-clothed person? And Lan Jia had brought up the Xuanyuan bloodline\u2026</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he talking about her? She was the descendant of the Xuanyuan Saint Tribe!? Tang Doudou was stunned by this thought. If that really was the case, it made a lot of other things fall into place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Just as Tang Doudou was sinking into her thoughts, she heard Baili Yiling\u2019s happy exclamation. \u201cI\u2019ve stayed in Cerulean Mountain for many years. I would go around exploring all the secret passages in Cerulean Mountain with the map that Grandpa Gui had given me to familiarize myself with the area. As of now, I can find my way through these passages even with my eyes closed. It was also after I became familiar with this place that I found the stone room that Mother stayed in when she was still alive\u2026 which is also Lan Jia\u2019s secret room.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she turned the corner and they arrived in the stone room they were in earlier.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling\u2019s expression now turned tense. \u201cBe careful, that dumb bug is still there. No matter what, we can\u2019t startle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

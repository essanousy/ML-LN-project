She would genuinely laugh, genuinely cry and clearly separate right from wrong and distinguish feelings of gratitude and resentment.</p><br/><p>She was similar to the women that he had seen before, yet still very different. In short, she was special. She was a woman that made him feel as if the more he looked at her, the more he did not want to part with her.</p><br/><p>The burning vigor that ignited in her eyes didn\u2019t escape Baili Yu\u2019s sight. Or perhaps it should be said, she never concealed any of her thoughts in front of Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Looks like his little woman wanted to become a big woman now!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, big evil spirit, you don\u2019t understand this sister\u2019s sorrow ah!\u201d She clapped Baili Yu on the shoulder and started to count on her fingers as she counted off the incidents from when she had encountered Mu Ye\u2019s assassination in Rutaceae Pavilion to the recent event where Liu Zhiyuan had hurt Jun Xin. \u201cYou see? Wasn\u2019t it all because I had you guys by my side that I managed to avert disasters? </p><br/><p>\u201cTo have so many people treat Wife well, that is also one of Wife\u2019s ability.\u201d After listening to her story, Baili Yu simply smiled lightly. Then he rubbed her nose and said deliberately, \u201cWomen ought to be protected, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nothing wrong with protecting women of course, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I can simply be at ease and become a sheltered turtle just because there are people to protect me right? Speaking of Mu Ye, he\u2019s the great Demonic Sect\u2019s Sect Leader. If it wasn\u2019t for me being a burden at that time, how could he have possibly almost died at the hands of Shen Moru? Even if he hadn\u2019t been able to defeat Shen Moru, escaping definitely wouldn\u2019t have been a problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, there is no need to be unduly humble. I heard that at that time, you were the one that forced Shen Moru to retreat\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right ah, because at that time I seemed to have exploded and became powerful. Otherwise, I reckon that Mu Ye and I would already be reporting to the King of Hell at his palace right now.\u201d When the conversation got to here, Baili Yu\u2019s eyes filled with darkness. That matter was also a heavy weight in his heart. Like Tang Doudou had said, he was not god. It was impossible for him to be at her side at all times, so it was not surprising at all that she wanted to become stronger.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there was still a matter lingering in his heart. It was a matter that, even if he had to exhaust his entire life\u2019s efforts to accomplish, he must do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, Mu Ye does treat Wife very well,\u201d After he pushed his current thoughts to the bottom of his heart, Baili Yu suddenly blurted out this one sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right ah, why does he treat me so well?\u201d Speaking of this, Tang Doudou was also baffled. When she thought that Mu Ye had died then, her state of mind was quite complicated, so much so that she couldn\u2019t even describe it.</p><br/><p>When Baili Yu saw her pondering over this issue earnestly like that, he could only shake his head helplessly and sigh. She was really a dense woman.</p><br/><p>When a man was willing to die for a woman, apart from love, what other explanation was there?</p><br/><p>His little woman ah, often complained that he attracted bees and butterflies (attract the attention of the opposite sex), yet she wasn\u2019t aware that she attracted way more colonies of bees and butterflies.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

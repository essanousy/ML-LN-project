Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know how many times this question had emerged in her heart.</p><br/><p>Su Yi seemed to realize that his reaction was unusual as well and he hastily corrected himself. \u201cWhat I mean is, did you come to the City Lord Residence just to check out the liveliness? It wasn\u2019t for some other motive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I have that much free time? Why would I insist on running all the way over here just to check out the liveliness?\u201d Tang Doudou snapped back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what did you come for?\u201d asked Su Yi curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of your business!\u201d Tang Doudou gave a humph, then said, \u201cAre you leaving or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot leaving after all.\u201d Su Yi shook out the creases in his robe. After he smoothed out the wrinkles, he pointed towards a corner of the garden and said, \u201cThere are several of your old friends over there. Come with me to go sit with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He has an illness! He really has an illness! He definitely has an illness! And it\u2019s beyond cure!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to go, then you go. I\u2019m heading back.\u201d She had no time to see what old friends were there. Not to mention, they were Li Xueyi\u2019s old friends so what would she go over for?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yi, are you Tang Seng\u2019s reincarnation?\u201d (The monk from Journey to the West, more details below)T/N</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Tang Seng? How could I possibly be his reincarnation? Based on how outstanding and formidable I am, if I\u2019m someone\u2019s reincarnation I should be Kou Yunhai\u2019s!\u201d (Kou Yunhai doesn\u2019t turn up any search results. It\u2019s likely that it\u2019s simply a famous figure in this fictional world.)</p><br/><p>He\u2019s beyond saving!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou covered her forehead. \u201cGive me some space.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sentence is . The first word translates to \u2018I\u2019. The second word translates to the meanings of \u2018want\u2019 \u2018think\u2019 and \u2018miss\u2019. The third and fourth words mean \u2018calm\u2019 and \u2018quiet\u2019. It\u2019s also a common name to give to a girl. So more literally, it\u2019s \u201cI want some quiet\u201d. It can also mean \u201cI miss (a person named) Jingjing\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich lady is Jingjing?\u201d Su Yi\u2019s eyes lit up as he looked Tang Doudou over. \u201cYou\u2019re finally starting to like women?\u201dT/N2</p><br/><p>Endure it! She\u2019ll endure it!</p><br/><p>Reminding herself about Su Yi\u2019s monster-like martial arts skills, Tang Doudou turned away without saying anything and headed towards the garden exit.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t afford to anger him, but that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t avoid him!</p><br/><p>However, just as she turned around, the sharp whistling sound of something piercing through the air reached her ears and she hastily sidestepped. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a sword stabbed halfway into a stone slab, still vibrating slightly. Before she had even recovered from her shock, she heard Su Yi\u2019s anxious voice. \u201cFeng Wu, what are you doing!? She\u2019s little (girl) Xueyi ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, a sweet-sounding voice that spoke neither too fast nor too slow said, \u201cYou\u2019re lying to me again. How could little Xueyi possibly be so dumb as to not even be able to dodge a sword I casually threw?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Tang Doudou turned to look in Su Yi\u2019s direction with both anger and curiosity. She wanted to know who exactly this woman, who not only attacked her out of the blue, but even threw shade on her identity, was.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know what happened to her. If you do this again, don\u2019t blame me for not being polite!\u201d Su Yi\u2019s voice suddenly turned cold and his tone filled with warning. Tang Doudou was surprised at this. She couldn\u2019t understand why Su Yi was so\u2026 protective of her?</p><br/><p>The feeling was similar to that of a mother chicken protecting a baby chick. Tang Doudou felt overwhelmed by this favor from a superior. Also at this moment, she finally got a look at the woman called Feng Wu.</p><br/><p>She was much taller than normal girls and was standing shoulder by shoulder with Su Yi. Her blazing red dress wrapped around her body, outlining her flawless and enticing curves. Unlike usual ancient era girls, she had wheat-colored skin. Her features were not particularly delicate but they were unusually glamorous. Her slightly wavy black hair was left loose and cascaded down her back freely, giving off a wild and unruly impression.</p><br/><p>The most unusual feature she had was that her eyes were water blue. They were the color of the sea and the sky, wild and pure.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gulped. She couldn\u2019t help but admit that this Feng Wu was truly extremely beautiful.</p><br/><p>If she wasn\u2019t standing next to Su Yi, the scene would have been so beautiful that one couldn\u2019t tear one\u2019s eyes away.</p><br/><p>Following that, Tang Doudou sighed in pity. With Su Yi standing next to Feng Wu and the two red garments fluttering in the wind, it was just like a pair of Spring Festival couplets. </p><br/><p>first line is pasted on the right side of a doorway at New Year, second on the left side, like such</p><br/><p>En. If Baili Yu was in this picture as well, even the horizontal couplet would be here.</p><br/><p>\u201cWah!? It\u2019s really little Xueyi ah!\u201d Feng Wu covered her mouth in shock when Tang Doudou turned around. Then she glared reproachfully at Su Yi. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that I purposefully held back, she would already be lying there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you still have the nerve to say that?\u201d replied Su Yi, annoyed, as he walked towards Tang Doudou. His eyes were filled with concern as he asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t get injured right? This crazy woman threw out the sword before I had a chance to react.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy, there\u2019s no way little Xueyi would blame me, right?\u201d Feng Wu also walked over and pushed Su Yi aside. Curiosity filled her blue eyes as she said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s any different even after getting poisoned by the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance?\u201d</p><br/><p>From Feng Wu\u2019s tone, it was likely that she knew Li Xueyi well.</p><br/><p>But what did that have to do with her, Tang Doudou? If she hadn\u2019t reacted fast enough, she\u2019d currently be a corpse.</p><br/><p>After being scared for no reason, if she didn\u2019t dig some benefits out of it, would she still be Tang Doudou?</p><br/><p>Thinking that, Tang Doudou slightly curved her eyes as she smiled sweetly. \u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t blame Feng Wu jiejie.\u201d (jiejie is older sister)</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That ugly ghost, Old Suo, was unexpectedly among them.</p><br/><p>The other three were unfamiliar faces. However, based on their attire it could be inferred that they were not ordinary people.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Gu Xun was back, Old Suo took the initiative to ask, \u201cHe\u2019s left?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I personally saw him leave.\u201d Gu Xun glanced at Old Suo, a trace of displeasure briefly flashing through his eyes. Then he greeted all the others with a smile before sitting back down on his own seat. \u201cWonder what advice Seniors have come to give today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t dare give advice. It\u2019s just that, as of now agitation is spreading throughout Mist City and all the powers are getting restless. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve come to ask if Old Pal Gu has any good ideas to get us brothers safely through this crisis?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Meng is joking,\u201d said Gu Xun mildly. \u201cGu Xun is slow-witted and have yet to even notice any crisis that could possibly threaten you Seniors. I\u2019ll have to ask Senior Meng to enlighten me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was Gu Xun slow-witted?</p><br/><p>No, he was extremely smart. What he was saying was that Meng Hao had to use information to trade for his help.</p><br/><p>Everyone sitting here had extensive world experience and also had made many business deals with Gu Xun throughout the years. How could it be possible for them not to know what he meant?</p><br/><p>In the past, they always prepared information in advance but with this current incident\u2026 Meng Hao stood up and said with a serious expression, \u201cOld Pal Gu, it\u2019s not that we older brothers wish to rip you off. I won\u2019t hide it from you, the City Lord has already rooted out all of our informants. As of now, we don\u2019t know much more than you do about this incident. We only came to look for you for the sake of guarding against the unexpected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSyndicate Leader Meng is right. Presently, though the City Lord didn\u2019t express any intention to deal with us on the surface, he has already secretly gotten rid of many of our brothers!\u201d The youth sitting next to Meng Hao gave a long sigh. \u201cJust the incident with Five Kilometers Emporium is odd enough to be a concern!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Suo who hadn\u2019t said a word for a long time now spoke up, \u201cThis incident is indeed a concern. I believe you guys all know who it was that set the fire. The most worrying matter is if that person has already reached a collaboration agreement with the City Lord. It\u2019s within his power to swallow Mist City and he has always had high ambitions. Mist City is such a gold mine, I think he has definitely set his eyes on it since long ago, it\u2019s just that he never had a good opportunity. As of now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused for a bit, then looked towards Gu Xun. \u201cThere\u2019s also no way for us to stay out of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Xun knew what he was pointing at and nodded. \u201cAlright, since there\u2019s no way to stay out of it, then Gu Xun is willing to work with you Seniors. Triumph or fall, we shall do it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Pal Gu is refreshingly straightforward.\u201d The worry in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes finally cleared when he saw Gu Xun agree. It\u2019s said that the person who understood the City Lord the most in Mist City was Gu Xun. He was really highly capable. In just a few years after arriving in Mist City, he practically gained connections to all the powers in the city and the connections were actually quite strong. Regardless of if it was him or other people, no one dared to stir up trouble. The people who didn\u2019t know that he was in that line of business always gave him positive evaluations. As for those who knew about his actual business, they would keep one eye closed to it as long as he didn\u2019t target members of their own family.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun muttered to himself for a while, then said, \u201cThere\u2019s still one more matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his serious expression, Meng Hao\u2019s heart thudded. Could it be that he knew something?</p><br/><p>Gu Xun saw Meng Hao\u2019s expression change and hastily explained with a smile, \u201cSenior Meng, no need to worry. What I\u2019m about to say has nothing to do with this matter. It\u2019s just that I wish to ask everyone to help keep a watch on a certain someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that. You gave me quite a scare!\u201d Meng Hao rubbed his chest. \u201cWho is it that you want us to keep a watch on? There\u2019s been quite a lot of people coming to Mist City lately ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Xun smiled. From the looks of it, Meng Hao had truly been scared bad by this incident. For better or for worse he was the leader of a syndicate, yet he has become a bird that gets startled by the mere twang of a bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere have been quite a lot, and they aren\u2019t ordinary people either. The person I wish to ask everyone to help tail is also not an ordinary person. Are you willing to help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that Old Pal Gu wants us to help tail that person, right?\u201d Long Yunzheng of Wound Dragon Syndicate who had been silent this entire time finally spoke. Dragons and snakes mingled in his syndicate, it was filled with people from the lowest rung of Mist City. Quite a lot of the beggars in Five Kilometers Emporium had belonged to his syndicate, so he had suffered the most damage from the fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s not him. I still don\u2019t have enough power to dare to tail him. Come, Brother Meng, let\u2019s sit down and talk about it slowly!\u201d Gu Xun invited Meng Hao to take a seat, then waved his hand to instruct someone to remove the tea set in front of him. Then he called for someone to serve up some fresh tea. \u201cNone of you have seen this person before\u2026 it involves the newest established power, God Firmament Hall. Everyone has heard of it, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>When this was brought up, everyone present with the exception of Old Suo exposed surprised expressions. They hadn\u2019t expected for Gu Xun to talk about this. It was true that this didn\u2019t have much to do with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person I want you guys to keep a watch on is the Master of God Firmament Hall, Ming Mengxin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou returned to Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce but didn\u2019t see Baili Yu anywhere. When she asked the manager, the manager said that he had returned, but soon after rushed out again.</p><br/><p>The manager was in charge of the Chamber of Commerce affairs so he wasn\u2019t very clear in regards to Baili Yu\u2019s whereabouts.</p><br/><p>It seemed she had to find Qing He.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou ran to the back courtyard and searched through the entire courtyard. Unexpectedly, even Qing He was gone. What was even stranger was the fact that the maids Baili Yu brought here were gone as well.</p><br/><p>Odd ah, strange ah. Where would they have gone?</p><br/><p>After searching several rounds, she still couldn\u2019t find anyone she could question. So then, Tang Doudou plopped her butt down on the rocking chair in the middle of the courtyard and sulked.</p><br/><p>The hidden guard that had been in charge of following Tang Doudou had searched through the entire city but still didn\u2019t find her. In the end, all he could do was return in defeat to the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce.</p><br/><p>Right after he walked in, he saw Tang Doudou sitting in the middle of the courtyard gloomily muttering something to herself.</p><br/><p>He slapped his own forehead. It was seriously such a blunder. Why didn\u2019t it occur to him that she had already returned?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Oh, that\u2019s right, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung City Lord, please don\u2019t pressure me, it was the City Lord that told us we weren\u2019t allowed to tell you.\u201d The maid shook her head firmly, showing no intention to bulge.</p><br/><p>That old brat\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently cursed him as she bit into the pastry in her hand. Her eyes suddenly lit up. If she wanted to know, wasn\u2019t it simple?</p><br/><p>The old brat said before that the position of Lord of Cloud City would be hers sooner or later. When she became Cloud City\u2019s master, he\u2019d have to spill the beans and tell her everything! At that time, it\u2019d be up her to decide if she felt like listening or not, humph\u2026</p><br/><p>She snickered evilly, realizing that the current life wasn\u2019t that bad.</p><br/><p>With some intermittent conversation, time passed quickly and they soon arrived at the matchmaking site.</p><br/><p>It was the large plaza at the center of Cloud City. In the past, Tang Doudou had seen it from the air but no matter how she tried, she couldn\u2019t walk over there. Speaking of which, there weren\u2019t a lot of people in Cloud City but the city was so large that it was frightening. It was at least two times bigger than Huai City.</p><br/><p>This plaza was also very large. It could probably contain several ten thousand people without being crowded.</p><br/><p>The entire population of Cloud City couldn\u2019t add up to several ten thousands. However, Tang Doudou was surprised by how many people had come to Cloud City.</p><br/><p>How did she know which people were inhabitants of Cloud City and which were outsiders? This was all thanks to Su Yi. He had separated the two groups with the crudest method. The left side was very sparse and they all looked as if they were just here to check out the liveliness. They also didn\u2019t reveal strange expressions upon seeing the two palanquins. It was obvious with a glance that they were people of Cloud City. Moreover, Murong Yu and the rest were sitting on a stage in front of them.</p><br/><p>The right side was very crowded and full of heads looking around curiously; it was clear that those were outsiders.</p><br/><p>However, unexpectedly, she didn\u2019t see Baili Yu on either side. She didn\u2019t even see Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>It made her become a little depressed.</p><br/><p>However, her attention was soon attracted by the enormous arena in front of her.</p><br/><p>Especially the four bold calligraphy words: Martial Arts Matchmaking Competition!</p><br/><p>She almost burst out laughing. What the heck? Could it be that a leftover woman like her who came to the ancient era actually needed to use this method in order to get married!? (A leftover woman is a woman with a successful career that has remained single.)</p><br/><p>However, wasn\u2019t this a little too boorish of a method?</p><br/><p>Although she didn\u2019t expect Su Yi to be able to think of some refined and cultured way to hold a matchmaking competition, she hadn\u2019t expected him to actually use such a simple and rough method.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, hadn\u2019t he said that the marriage was going to be based on wealth and treasures?</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou entertained all these random thoughts, the palanquin reached the tall stage and stopped at the side.</p><br/><p>She looked in Su Yi\u2019s direction and saw him fly out majestically. He whirled in the air and his dark blue garments swept outwards in a rampant manner as he descended down onto the seat.</p><br/><p>His appearance was seriously as flashy as one could possibly be. That, when supplemented with his outstanding looks, immediately caused a bunch of girls to start shrieking wildly.</p><br/><p>The maid said to Tang Doudou, \u201cYoung City Lord, it\u2019s about time to get out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Upon hearing that, Tang Doudou put down the pastry in her hand and made to climb out. The maid immediately pulled her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung City Lord, you plan to go out like this?\u201d The maid\u2019s tone was very helpless.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou tilted her head and thought about it. The flashy scene of how Su Yi leaped out flashed through her mind\u2026</p><br/><p>Could it be that she too\u2026 Forget it. She had better just get out the normal way.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, this way is fine. Trying to act awesome without any basis is deadly. Being low-key while enjoying luxury is the best way to blind people!\u201d After she finished speaking, she laughed heartily and walked out.</p><br/><p>That maid stood in place, slightly stunned. Although she didn\u2019t understand all of what Tang Doudou said, it didn\u2019t matter since that wasn\u2019t what she meant either!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

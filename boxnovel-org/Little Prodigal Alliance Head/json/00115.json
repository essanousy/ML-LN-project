She couldn\u2019t hear what they were discussing, so she decided to stop trying to listen and observed Boss Suo instead. She discovered that for some unknown reason, he seemed a bit troubled ever since he\u2019d returned. She couldn\u2019t help but wonder why that was the case.</p><br/><p>There was no way that Boss Suo would take the initiative to talk about it. She also couldn\u2019t figure it out just by guessing, so she decided to go back to listening to the short and skinny guy. Just as she lowered her eyes, she saw that Boss Suo was starting to daze out as he stared at the antique lamp.</p><br/><p>She immediately became more alert. The reason why his mood suddenly changed was because of this lamp!E/N</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s guess was right.</p><br/><p>Boss Suo was worrying about the lamp at her waist. It turns out that he saw a new Mist City announcement post when he went to do his business earlier. It was concerning this antique lamp.</p><br/><p>The announcement showed that someone was searching for this antique lamp. They hoped whoever saw the lamp would take down the announcement and notify the City Lord\u2019s Residence. It even included a reward of a huge sum as compensation for this information.</p><br/><p>For most people, this would be a cushy job. For Boss Suo however, just the seal pressed on the corner of that notice was enough to startle him awake from sleep. So the effect of the fact that the notice mentioned that that person was in Mist City didn\u2019t even need to be explained.</p><br/><p>When that person was brought up, the reason why Boss Suo was in this human trafficking business must also be brought up.</p><br/><p>More or less it was because Boss Suo was too full of youthful vigor back then. He was highly skilled in medicine, yet he was full of dishonest schemes. Since ancient times, medicine and poison have been complements. Since his medical expertise was high, his skill with poison naturally wasn\u2019t lacking either.</p><br/><p>It was common for people to poison others on the Jianghu. In addition, he was able to mask this fact from everyone due to his medical expertise. Although the income from rescuing people and giving medical treatment wasn\u2019t low, most of the time it was the poor that came to ask for treatment. Though he was a degenerate, he still had medical ethics and simply couldn\u2019t leave people to die. Therefore, the income often did not cover expenditure for him. From the start, Boss Suo had been born in an impoverished family and had his fill of impoverished days. So how could he accept things as they were?</p><br/><p>He made numerous inquiries and, as the heavens truly do not abandon resolute people, he finally found a way to make money.</p><br/><p>And that was poisoning people.E/N2</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Suo!\u201d Talk of the past will stop here. Skinny was leading Fatty back over.E/N3</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

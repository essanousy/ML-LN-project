In addition, Baili Yiling had only interacted with Baili Yu for a short time so she probably didn\u2019t remember his voice clearly either.</p><br/><p>As expected, when Baili Yiling heard his voice, a sweet smile appeared on her face. \u201cNo! Big Brother, it\u2019s not late! Yiling\u2019s already really happy just to be able to see Big Brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw her smile, he faintly smiled as well, and that smile seeped into his voice, making it seem even more like Baili Yu\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s good that Yiling\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, they bullied me.\u201d Baili Yiling\u2019s thoughts were jumping all over the place because she was only half conscious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Big Brother\u2019s here so they won\u2019t dare to bully you ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, I want to eat tanghulu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, I want pretty clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll buy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Brother\u2026</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling started awake from her dream and her eyes darted around the room. However, all that entered her sight was an unfamiliar room. Where was her brother anywhere in sight?</p><br/><p>However, that had felt so real.</p><br/><p>She sighed softly and wiped away the sweat on her forehead. Was it Jun Xin that brought her back?</p><br/><p>Where was this place?</p><br/><p>She got off the bed and was just about to walk towards the window when she heard a clear voice come from outside. \u201cEldest Miss, are you awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eldest Miss?</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling was stunned for quite a while before she finally realized that the person outside was addressing her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I\u2019m awake. You are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis servant is Qing Wu. Young Master Jun sent me to attend to you, Eldest Miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin sent her? To attend to her?</p><br/><p>Eldest Miss? Had Jun Xin already announced her identity publicly? Why would he suddenly become so considerate?</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Miss, since you\u2019re awake, should this servant help you wash up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling opened the door and took a look at Qing Wu. Qing Wu\u2019s conduct was natural and unrestrained, making her appear very much like a young miss. How did she look anything like a maid?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to attend to me. Just tell me where I should go to wash up.\u201d When Baili Yiling saw Qing Wu\u2019s looks, she thought that Jun Xin was purposefully sending this woman as a \u2018servant\u2019 to mock her so she became annoyed.</p><br/><p>Qing Wu\u2019s smile stiffened. She had no idea where she messed up to make this new master angry.</p><br/><p>However, their new master really resembled Master too much. Those eyes were remarkably alike and caused her to instinctively fear their new miss.</p><br/><p>She was inwardly thinking that this person really was Master\u2019s biological younger sister. The fact that she had a bad temper must run in the family, and no matter how terrible her temper got, it would still be better than Master\u2019s.</p><br/><p>She immediately smiled again and said, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had no idea that Baili Yiling had taken in all of her tiny expression changes just now. Baili Yiling inwardly gave a cold humph and said, \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Miss, please, this way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Humph! Jun Xin! You actually dared to treat this lady like this! You\u2019d better watch your back!</p><br/><p>Jun Xin who was currently watching over Tang Doudou suddenly sneezed. He rubbed his nose, then glanced over to check on Tang Doudou, who had fallen asleep again. Who was it that had such unhealthy interests as to curse him in the middle of the night instead of going to sleep?</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be Baili Yiling, that damned girl, right?</p><br/><p>When that girl\u2019s annoying face appeared in his mind, his face immediately darkened. Why did he remember that girl\u2019s looks so well?</p><br/><p>En, it was because she looked too similar to Baili Yu. He had long gotten so used to Baili Yu\u2019s face that he was sick of it, so it was normal that it had been easy for him to remember that girl\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>He retrieved his thoughts and shifted his gentle gaze towards Tang Doudou again. \u201cYou ah, why do you always make people worry so much about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s dead, so he\u2019s dead. There are plenty of good men in the world. Aren\u2019t you usually pretty open-minded? Why are you so fixated on him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you torment yourself this way and he finds out, he\u2019d definitely die with his eyes still open from lingering regret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so good-looking that his face is like a beautiful gem. If he dies with his eyes still open, that face will become ugly and unsightly. He\u2019ll bleed from all seven apertures of his head and his eyes will glower creepily\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll probably get scared to death by his own looks in the Yellow Springs. What do you think will happen to a ghost that dies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that ghost\u2019s soul disperse so that he can never reincarnate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, you\u2019re sure good at talking!\u201d A cold sneer suddenly came from the nearby window. \u201cBut, is there any use to you scaring her like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t need to look to know who it was. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t come, how long did you plan to keep it from me?\u201d Feng Long jumped in with a laugh, but her hypnotic eyes were abnormally cold.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin pressed his lips together without speaking.</p><br/><p>Feng Long walked over with large steps and fiercely seized his collar to slam him against the bed pillar. \u201cSpeak! What exactly happened to Master? If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I heard about the eldest miss returning, how long were you planning to keep it from me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin pushed away her hand, annoyed and sat back down next to the bed. \u201cIf you want to know, go ask Baili Yiling. I don\u2019t have the time to deal with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Long was so angry her chest hurt. Master was dead, was he not hurt at all? Did he feel no sorrow?</p><br/><p>Jun Xin, Jun Xin, do you even still have a heart? (Jun Xin\u2019s name, xin = heart)</p><br/><p>Or was it that in your heart, no one other than the useless thing lying on the bed mattered!?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill her!\u201d With how strong master was, how could he have died so easily? It was definitely because he had been trying to save this woman! Feng Long\u2019s eyes filled with murderous intent and a blade immediately shot out.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin blocked the blade and sent Feng Long crashing to the ground with a strike. He stood up and towered over Feng Long as he said, \u201cShe has already gotten married with Baili Yu and is currently pregnant with Baili Yu\u2019s child. Do you still want to kill her after knowing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

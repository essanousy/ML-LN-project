He took out a handkerchief and reached over to help Xi Qiulin wipe his mouth.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiulin was fed up. He snatched the handkerchief and pushed the Prime Minister aside. After wiping the wine from his lips, he forced a smile as he looked towards Baili Yu. \u201cResplendent Imperial Uncle, you\u2019re joking again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat makes Your Majesty think I\u2019m joking?\u201d Baili Yu got up and slowly walked down from the high stage. His ink hair lightly lifted with his every movement and his moon-white robe was bright and clear as frost. He seemed as pure and untainted as those celestials in paintings.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot joking? Then what did Resplendent Imperial Uncle mean by what you said earlier?\u201d Xi Qiulin\u2019s eyes were dark as he puzzled over what exactly Baili Yu meant to do. Who in this world didn\u2019t know that he liked men? That after he saw the new Alliance Head, Li Xueyi\u2019s captivating looks, he no longer cared about having a respectable identity and insisted on becoming a bride of the Alliance Head Residence.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t reply to Xi Qiulin and instead walked directly to Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>As of now, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t be counted as short. However, she was still a big chunk shorter in comparison to Baili Yu. With him standing in front of her like this, his large stature cast a shadow that completely covered Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Those gorgeous peach blossom eyes were filled with a deep radiance. This woman, when she heard she was about to be betrothed to Xi Qiuyue, actually didn\u2019t immediately refused but stood here dazing out and thinking.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be that she really was considering accepting this?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu recalled that the first time he saw her at Rutaceae Pavilion, she was right next to Xi Qiuyue. Looks like the relationship between the two was worth spending some time to deliberate.</p><br/><p>When he thought up to here, Baili Yu\u2019s smile became even more glittery.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, shouldn\u2019t you give a greeting upon seeing this husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>My god! What\u2019s this seductive yao coming here to join in the liveliness for!? It couldn\u2019t be that her female disguise had that much charm?</p><br/><p>Wait. This wasn\u2019t the main problem, alright?</p><br/><p>The main problem was that the Emperor had called him Resplendent Imperial Uncle?</p><br/><p>Oh my fucking god!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced around again. As the Emperor and the Prime Minister were here, the identities of the other people around definitely weren\u2019t low. The crucial point was that everyone in this courtyard were people of the Imperial Court. If her identity as the Alliance Head of the martial arts circles was revealed, then wouldn\u2019t the Emperor catch her and immediately \u2018kacha-kacha\u2019 her?</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t Meng Yu give her any warning earlier?</p><br/><p>What should she do now?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was a little worried. It would have been better if they were strangers, yet not only did Bai Lianhua know her, Xi Qiuyue did as well. Lastly, she even smacked Xi Qiuyue with a stick. Hell, the way he questioned her earlier definitely meant he noticed something.</p><br/><p>Now the main matter was what stance Baili Yu was holding.</p><br/><p>He was the Imperial Uncle of the Emperor of Wind Spirit Imperial Court. Why hasn\u2019t anyone ever heard of this?</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou wondered, she sneakily glanced at Baili Yu, trying to spy something in his eyes.</p><br/><p>In the end, she was very disappointed. The damned seductive yao\u2019s eyes only contained a smiling expression, nothing else could be made out.</p><br/><p>Damn it! It\u2019s all cause this smile is too captivating!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently cursed, then also revealed a big smile as she looked towards Baili Yu. \u201cMy dear Master, did you forget to take medicine before you headed out the doors today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife didn\u2019t even bring it to this husband, so where was this husband supposed to go to get it?\u201d Baili Yu lifted up Tang Doudou\u2019s chin with a practiced motion and frivolously tapped her nose. \u201cWife is sure naughty. You came here to play but didn\u2019t even invite this husband to go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, Baili Yu blinked his eyes at her. Those palm-leaf fan lashes sent so many sparks Tang Doudou\u2019s entire heart turned limp and numb.</p><br/><p>Then, she instantly understood that Baili Yu was doing this to help her!</p><br/><p>She immediately started climbing up Baili Yu\u2019s pole. \u201cAhem, never thought you would be able to recognize me even after I dressed up like this. Impressive, impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife\u2019s every word and smile is engraved deep into this husband\u2019s heart. How could this husband not recognize you?\u201d She didn\u2019t count as dumb after all. She still knew to climb following the pole. Baili Yu slightly curved his eyes as he took Tang Doudou\u2019s hand. Then, he turned towards Xi Qiulin and said rather apologetically, \u201cPlease excuse us, Your Majesty, my wife has let you see a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two\u2019s back and forth exchange had confused everyone present. The only ones aware of the inside story were Xi Qiuyue, Bai Lianhua, and Meng Yu.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue wiped his sweat and remarked in his heart: good thing Baili Yu has stepped out. Otherwise, the aftermath would have been terrible.</p><br/><p>Bai Lianhua didn\u2019t even know how many handkerchiefs she had ruined with her rubbing as she fiercely glared at Tang Doudou, wishing she could just glare a hole into Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>As for Meng Yu, she looked at the sky, then at the ground, then gazed towards the east and stared towards the west. The only things she refused to look at were her Master and the Alliance Head da ren.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiulin\u2019s expression became more and more ugly as Baili Yu ignored him. Nice trick, Baili Yu. Of course his people would go along with what he said. He never expected that Baili Yu was this stingy and refused to let go of even a lowly kitchen maid.</p><br/><p>What was most hateful was the fact that he, as the grand majestic Emperor, has always been known to speak with the golden mouth and all words were unquestionable as jade. Yet now, he actually had to inquire about Baili Yu\u2019s opinion!</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial Uncle, everyone knows that you have yet to take a wife so where did this wife come from? Imperial Uncle must think things through clearly. The punishment for the crime of deceiving a monarch is not light!\u201d Things having gotten to this point, Xi Qiulin couldn\u2019t endure letting Baili Yu have his way anymore.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled. \u201cYour Majesty\u2019s words are too heavy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He completely did not mind the crime of deceiving a monarch.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiulin slapped the table with a \u2018thump\u2019 and said coldly, \u201cResplendent Imperial Uncle, zhen is not joking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also did not joke.\u201d Baili Yu was still speaking with a mild tone, yet it was also filled with a hint of powerful aggressiveness. Though he was facing the most powerful and important person in the country, his aura didn\u2019t weaken at all.</p><br/><p>Of course, Tang Doudou was very worried upon seeing all of this and had tugged Baili Yu\u2019s sleeve countless times.</p><br/><p>Meow a mii ah! Stupidly awesome seductive yao, even if you\u2019re that person\u2019s uncle, that person is still the Emperor that stands above ten thousand people. Aren\u2019t you worried about being accused of scheming a rebellion if you speak so disrespectfully!?</p><br/><p>He\u2019s showing respect for you by calling you Imperial Uncle, but this isn\u2019t for the sake of giving you face but to show his benevolence and righteousness!</p><br/><p>He\u2019s pretty smart most of the time, but why is he being so muddleheaded now?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nervously glanced at Baili Yu\u2019s chin and didn\u2019t see any signs of him being concerned about this matter. As for Xi Qiuyue, he had started to drink tea in contentment.</p><br/><p>In any case, Baili Yu has stepped up, so it\u2019s none of his business now.</p><br/><p>In any case, as long as Baili Yu steps up, he can anger the Emperor half to death.</p><br/><p>Of course, the latter was something he couldn\u2019t do anything about either.</p><br/><p>If Xi Qiulin found out that his own uncle was thinking this way, there would have been no need for Baili Yu. Just finding this out would be enough to triple his blood pressure, cause his eyes to roll back and his heart to stop from anger.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xi Qiulin didn\u2019t know what Xi Qiuyue was thinking. However, just seeing the way he acted as if this entire thing had nothing to do with him was enough to anger Xi Qiulin to the point his lips trembled.</p><br/><p>These Imperial Uncles are sure wonderful!</p><br/><p>He laughed grimly in his heart. Did they really think he didn\u2019t dare to touch them?</p><br/><p>\u201cCome! The Resplendent Prince, Baili Yu, has committed the crime of deceiving the monarch. Arrest him and imprison him until the High Judiciary Office deals with him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfff!\u201d Xi Qiuyue who was in the middle of drinking tea spurted the tea out on the Prime Minister. He didn\u2019t have the time to care about the Prime Minister whose expression was black as coal. He hastily stood up and knelt in front of Xi Qiulin. \u201cYour Majesty, please reconsider. The Resplendent Prince, the Resplendent Prince, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t be arrested. These three words rolled around in his mouth but was swallowed back to his stomach when Xi Qiulin directed a carnivorous glare at him.</p><br/><p>While Xi Qiuyue was trying to speak, the guards had already rushed over.</p><br/><p>After they rushed in here, their expressions were completely at a loss. Arrest the Resplendent Prince? Who\u2019s the Resplendent Prince?</p><br/><p>Only a few of the people present knew of Baili Yu\u2019s identity. There was no way these guards could have known.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all dazing out for! Tie him up!\u201d Xi Qiulin\u2019s anger exploded when he saw the entire bunch of guards staring blankly without moving. He kicked the nearest guard\u2019s butt and with an angry sweep of his sleeve, pointed towards Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Oh, so he\u2019s the Resplendent Prince ah!</p><br/><p>He looks way too different from His Majesty!</p><br/><p>The guards glanced at Baili Yu who was standing there like a deity and compared him with the utterly flustered with anger Emperor. They couldn\u2019t help but give an emotional sigh.</p><br/><p>Though they couldn\u2019t help but sigh, they were still effectively trained guards. They moved uniformly to surround Baili Yu. The leading guard held a hemp rope in his hands. This was originally something that he had done countless times, yet when he met those extraordinary eyes, his hands continuously shook. D-did he really have to tie him up?</p><br/><p>As he thought this, he turned back to glance at his family\u2019s Emperor.</p><br/><p>When Xi Qiulin saw this, he immediately started scolding in fury. \u201cDisgraceful bunch of servants. If I tell you to tie him up, tie him up! If you keep dawdling, zhen will chop off your heads!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four words, \u2018chop off your heads\u2019, shocked that guard so much he jolted. He approached Baili Yu a little bit more. As he gazed at Baili Yu\u2019s magnificent face, he gulped and said, \u201cResplendent Prince, Your Majesty, Resplendent Prince, this servant\u2026 this servant will be tying you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon seeing his hopeless performance, Xi Qiulin was angered to the point he almost fainted.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu gave a low chuckle but didn\u2019t speak. Instead, he looked at Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>There was no other reason than the fact that Tang Doudou had gotten angry when Xi Qiulin started talking about punishing him. As Baili Yu gazed at Tang Doudou\u2019s infuriated expression, he felt rather delighted. It was like he had eaten honey, his heart filled with sweetness.</p><br/><p>This little yatou finally cared about him.</p><br/><p>This was the important point ah! The question of whether he\u2019ll get punished or not didn\u2019t matter at all.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was indeed very angry. She had seen quite a lot of muddleheaded emperors on tv dramas, but she has never seen an emperor this muddleheaded!</p><br/><p>What the heck is all this!?</p><br/><p>Does he really think that he can be undisciplined and out of control just because he\u2019s an Emperor?</p><br/><p>Taking the fruits of people\u2019s labors lightly and casually deciding on the victor. Then he casually decides on a mandarin duck pair and doesn\u2019t even let the person\u2019s husband harbor any objections! Pei! Not a husband!</p><br/><p>Afterwards, he even accused his Imperial Uncle of the crime of lying to one\u2019s monarch although his Imperial Uncle spoke the truth!</p><br/><p>The more Tang Doudou thought about it, the angrier she got. When she saw the rope in that guard\u2019s hand, she exploded. She rushed up and sent a huge slap over as she scolded, \u201cAs if you\u2019ll tie a damned thing, you old bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of the time before that guard returned to his senses, she snatched the rope from his hand and instantly appeared in front of Xi Qiulin. In two seconds, she had the rope tied around Xi Qiulin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuddleheaded scrambled egg! Let this Big Sis give you a lesson on how an Emperor is supposed to act!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment those words fell, an enormous \u2018thud\u2019 rang out.</p><br/><p>She actually kicked Xi Qiulin to the ground!</p><br/><p>This development seriously occurred too quickly. Nobody knew how she was able to move so rapidly and by the time they reacted, that noble, grand Emperor had already been trampled to the ground by Tang Doudou. Xi Qiulin roared in rage, \u201cBaili Yu, are you planning to revolt!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRevolt against the crime an old bastard like you decided!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you-you brute of a woman!\u201d Xi Qiulin really wanted to just faint like this. Humiliating. It was seriously too humiliating. When had he, since childhood until now, ever received a humiliation like this!?</p><br/><p>\u201cA woman that\u2019s going to thrash an old bastard like you!\u201d Tang Doudou blew on her fist, then sent another punch over.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Doudou, stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>This had seriously been too shocking. Xi Qiuyue had only managed to react after Xi Qiulin got two panda eyes. He immediately shouted and rushed over to the rescue.</p><br/><p>But a flash filled his vision and Baili Yu\u2019s seemingly smiling but not quite smiling face appeared in front of him. \u201cWhere is Sangfroid Prince planning to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

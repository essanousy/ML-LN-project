Even with Mu Ye\u2019s chain wrapped around her, it was with great difficulty that she finally climbed onto the slope behind the mountain cave.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou plopped her butt down and panted for breath after climbing, she couldn\u2019t be bothered to care if the ground was dirty. \u201cDo you mean that we can only walk along this cliff to search our way up since there\u2019s no way to get back from Devil\u2019s Pond?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye replied \u2018en\u2019 as he sat down next to her. When the strong scent of hormones drifted over, Tang Doudou\u2019s heart started racing again.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye gazed towards the faintly-visible ocean surface in the distance and asked softly, \u201cWould you like to hear a story?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin and dragged herself out of her thoughts. She looked towards Mu Ye with puzzlement. Why did he offer to tell her a story out of nowhere?</p><br/><p>However, she has always been a good listener so she nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye continued looking into the distance. His lips moved slightly and his high Adam\u2019s apple also moved up and down. His cold voice contained a bit of sorrow when he started speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree Years of Chowa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was no longer that little novice transmigrator, she knew that \u2018Three Years of Chowa\u2019 was the era name for the previous dynasty. By the looks of it, the story Mu Ye wanted to tell was related to the previous dynasty. Could it have something to do with Madame Qin?</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter a heavy rain washed away that thick accumulated layer of blood on the walls of the imperial city, I infiltrated the palace with my master and saw that woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Mu Ye actually had some talent at storytelling. If only his tone could be a bit more animated. Tang Doudou was still mulling over what Mu Ye had just said when he stopped speaking and took a deep look at her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s brain stopped functioning for a moment and she blurt out, \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise that you also have a master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right afterwards, she regretted it. Mu Ye\u2019s face turned as dark as coal.</p><br/><p>Why did she say that? It was such a stupid question. If he didn\u2019t have a master, could he have just been born with such powerful martial arts?</p><br/><p>Even after Sun Wukong jumped out from a rock, he only became undefeatable after being an apprentice to a master and training earnestly\u2026</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t dare to speak anymore and embarrassedly copied Mu Ye in looking towards the sea. When she saw the fierce sea dragon playing in the water and even chasing its own tail, she couldn\u2019t help but remark, \u201cFrom the looks of it, even a fierce dragon has a childish heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye also looked towards the sea dragon, then coldly spat, \u201cBeast.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tone was very heavy. Tang Doudou\u2019s heart pounded and she didn\u2019t dare to look at him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster only told me after we entered the palace that a good friend of his had asked him to protect the child inside the woman\u2019s belly. It was only then that it occured to me who this woman was.\u201d After a period of silence, Mu Ye continued his story.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou continued watching the sea dragon splash around in the water but her ears were pricked up to catch Mu Ye\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, the Chowa dynasty was already nearing the end of its time. The imperial palace was a mess. Master had no choice but to stay in the imperial palace in order to protect that woman\u2019s child, so I also stayed in the turbulent palace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sea breeze gently rustled the tree leaves on the hillside as Mu Ye slowly recounted the past. The atmosphere was very tranquil and relaxing.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou only noticed that she had been absorbed in the story after Mu Ye had finished speaking. She hadn\u2019t even realized when her eyes had gotten wet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter Master passed away, I succeeded the position of Leader of the Demonic Sect. However, even after searching for many years, I still couldn\u2019t find that child.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Mu Ye spoke, his hand landed on the bundle of bones. \u201cMaster\u2019s good friend, your father, had been missing ever since that huge fire. I never thought that he had actually come back here.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the first time she had heard Mu Ye speak so much, and it was even about her. She couldn\u2019t help but feel little sad and dazed. \u201cI\u2019m that child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Back then you even tried to kill me!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou swallowed the rest of her words. She glanced at the bones. \u201cMu Ye, I\u2019m not accusing you of lying, but when I was at Mist City, Old Tang\u2026 ah, that\u2019s my grandpa, apparently. He said that when he found me, my parents had already died at the scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s gaze darkened. \u201cThose aren\u2019t your birth parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Tang Doudou expressed that she really couldn\u2019t understand the world of the ancients.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye looked at her again and asked calmly, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe!\u201d Tang Doudou replied without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re someone that would rather stay silent than lie!\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes curved as she said this softly.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s cold eyes flickered slightly as he said, \u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he fell silent.</p><br/><p>Luckily, Tang Doudou had already gotten used to him being like this. She yawned, then stretched and asked, \u201cAre we going to keep going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye stood up. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again, the two started walking in silence with lowered heads.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He\u2019s definitely off to do something shady. Since he\u2019s someone of the Alliance Head Residence, if he did something bad, other people would say that I, as the Alliance Head, failed in disciplining my subordinates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just curious, aren\u2019t you? Why make up so many excuses?\u201d said Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glared at him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go, just head back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I\u2019m pretty curious as well. Bai Feiyun has always been called the \u2018white jade gongzi\u2018 and is known on the Jianghu as a rarely seen good person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, enough, I know what you mean.\u201d Tang Doudou hastily waved to stop Jun Xin\u2019s chatter and jumped forward just in time to see Bai Feiyun enter a small door.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, hurry!\u201d Tang Doudou beckoned Jun Xin and jumped onto the roof. She saw that Bai Feiyun was following a peasant into a house in the small courtyard.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin followed her at a leisurely pace. He glanced over and remarked, \u201cThat pleasant seems to be from the Bai family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSaw him once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a strong memory,\u201d said Tang Doudou half-teasingly.</p><br/><p>She was just about to jump down when Jun Xin stopped her. She turned and asked, \u201cWhy are you stopping me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you dumb?\u201d Jun Xin glanced at the courtyard again. \u201cThe reason I remember him is because he\u2019s a trusted aid of the Bai Family Head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou seemed confused. \u201cSo what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s no need to look. Since that guy\u2019s here, Bai Feiyun is definitely here to see the head of the Bai Family,\u201d explained Jun Xin. Then he lay down on the roof and folded his arms behind his head. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s just wait for Bai Feiyun to come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the head of the Bai Family a really powerful person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the Jianghu, the most famous powers aside from your Alliance Head Residence are the four large clans: Lin, Bai, Murong, and Xiao. After you lost your memories, you didn\u2019t have much interest in managing the matters of the Jianghu so you naturally don\u2019t know this. Although the Lin family was the leader of the four large clans, it\u2019s the Bai Family Head, Bai Luoqing, who\u2019s the strongest in martial arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA woman?\u201d Tang Doudou was surprised. She hadn\u2019t expected that such a powerful person would actually be a woman.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin just asked in response, \u201cAren\u2019t you also a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Bai Feiyun cut his ties with the Bai family? Why would he secretly come here to meet Bai Luoqing? Could it be that everything he said before were lies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were definitely true, but the person that cut ties with the Bai family was his mother, not him. The Bai family is a strong reliable support since they have large human and material resources. It\u2019s not something that White Clouds Manor can hope to compare to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I get it now.\u201d Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. \u201cHe wants help from the Bai family for something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin brushed back his loose hair. \u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what is it for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good to be too curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, fine, I won\u2019t go, but in a little while, make sure to move fast and knock him unconscious for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only here for the show. When did I become your subordinate?\u201d Jun Xin closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little brat!\u201d Tang Doudou slapped his head. \u201cI have a lot of inner strength but I barely know any martial arts. If I do it, I\u2019ll immediately be discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, so what does it have to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! One meal! Are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you can bait me with food\u2026\u201d Jun Xin flipped over and propped up his head. His eyes shone as he extended three fingers and waved them in front of Tang Doudou. \u201cAdd, add three more! Four meals!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, fine, fine!\u201d Tang Doudou really didn\u2019t know what to do with this gutton. She slapped aside the claw in front of her. Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw Bai Feiyun walk out. She hastily slapped the back of Jun Xin\u2019s head. \u201cStinkin\u2019 brat, hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin slowly got up. \u201cIf you hit this little master again next time, I won\u2019t bother with you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough talking, hurry and go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun cupped his fist as he bid goodbye to Old Bai, then walked out with a frown.</p><br/><p>Old Bai hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cBai gongzi, please don\u2019t blame this old man for speaking out of turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you know that you\u2019re speaking out of turn, don\u2019t speak. Feiyun still has business and will be leaving now,\u201d replied Bai Feiyun mildly before leaving without turning back.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was concerned over something so he didn\u2019t notice Jun Xin swaggering behind him.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lay on her stomach on the roof. As she watched Jun Xin walk right behind Bai Feiyun without even bothering to hide, she felt so nervous that her heart tensed up. This guy was way too fearless. What if he got caught?</p><br/><p>As she watched Jun Xin worriedly, she quietly urged, \u201cLittle brat, hurry up ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin waved her off, annoyed. Then he picked up a rock and weighed it in his hand for a moment before exhaling and saying, \u201cBai gongzi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s mouth twitched. Why happened to sneakily knocking him out!? This idiot!</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s brows furrowed slightly as he turned around. \u201cJun\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he even finished speaking, he was hit by the stone in Jun Xin\u2019s hand. A trace of confusion flashed through his eyes, then he collapsed to the ground.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

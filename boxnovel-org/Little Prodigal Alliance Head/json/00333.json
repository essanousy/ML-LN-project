The ticklish feeling made Tang Doudou laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit messing around, his face is about to turn purple!\u201d Here they were messing around while the guy was standing there not knowing what to do. Anyone would be angry in this situation. And this guy seemed to have an inherently bad temper as well.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu said quietly, \u201cEven if his face turns black, he still wouldn\u2019t dare to do anything to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven a rabbit bites when it\u2019s cornered!\u201d Tang Doudou shot Baili Yu an annoyed look. Just a few days ago, this guy was still acting as such a good person at the Wind Cherishing House.</p><br/><p>She thought that his personality had changed after he lost his memories, but unexpectedly, it was just as bad as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if a toothless rabbit bites, it wouldn\u2019t hurt. Don\u2019t worry, Wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we also in a hurry? What are we supposed to do if they keep blocking the way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s hand gently brushed over her wrist. He only let go after he confirmed that her current condition was pretty good. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry, they\u2019re even more anxious than we are.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said, right after he said this, another horse squeezed through. Tang Doudou lifted the curtain slightly and saw that it was another young man that was wearing an identical outfit to the man currently in front of them. However, his personality seemed much gentler. He first shot a look at the man blocking the road before turning his horse to stop next to the carriage.</p><br/><p>Releasing his reins, he cupped his fist towards Baili Yu and said politely, \u201cThis uncle, we\u2019re guards of Indigo Mountain\u2019s Xiao family. Due to an urgent matter, we have to get to Indigo Mountain immediately. We ended up being discourteous due to our impatience, but we hope you will take the Xiao family into consideration and forgive Xiao Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi immediately opened his mouth to protest, but this young man shot him a warning look. Xiao Yi humphed unhappily, but in the end, he stayed silent and just turned his head to the side in contempt.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu looked calmly at the young man in front of him and gave a warm smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to talk about forgiveness. In addition, it\u2019s this young man blocking the way now. If you guys are in a rush, then you should talk to this young man instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man from the Xiao family smiled as well. \u201cWe\u2019ll just pass through by the side. Uncle, please hold onto your horse well.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he spoke, he called for the people behind them to pass through by the side. Once most of the servants passed by, the young man cupped his fist towards Baili Yu again. \u201cWe truly are in the wrong for this matter. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that we have a pressing matter to address, we\u2019d definitely invite you two to the Xiao family to rest for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw that Baili Yu showed no reaction to his words, he glanced towards Xiao Yi. \u201cI hope Uncle will tell us your surname and residence. After we deal with this matter, I\u2019ll definitely bring Xiao Yi there to apologize in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xiao Yi, who was already surrounded by people, heard this, his eyes widened and he shouted, \u201cXiao Sizhui, have you gone crazy!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Sizhui didn\u2019t pay him any heed and just continued, \u201cUncle, there\u2019s no need to worry about us taking revenge. You probably already know about our family teachings, so please tell us your surname and where your residence is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Since you\u2019re being so sincere, I, as a generous person, won\u2019t hold it against you and tell the Xiao family about what you guys did. Since you guys have urgent business, then hurry and go.\u201d Since Xiao Sizhui had been pretty polite, Baili Yu finally gave a very magnanimous smile as he waved them away.</p><br/><p>Xiao Sizhui lowered his eyes. He said that he wouldn\u2019t tell the Xiao family, but what if he did right after they left? That would be huge trouble.</p><br/><p>It must been known that the Xiao family were extremely strict about these matters. Regardless of who started the conflict, they\u2019d definitely have points deducted and be punished\u2026</p><br/><p>When Xiao Sizhui didn\u2019t say anything else, Baili Yu didn\u2019t speak either.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou quietly persuaded, \u201cIn our current situation, we shouldn\u2019t make too much of a fuss. Since they\u2019ve apologized, let\u2019s just let them go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu said with a smile, \u201cI already said that they could go, they\u2019re the ones that don\u2019t want to leave. This can\u2019t be blamed on this husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>But the way you spoke made it so that the gentle-looking youngster doesn\u2019t even dare to say anything else.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently criticized him. Her eyes suddenly lit up with a thought and she quietly asked, \u201cCould it be that you\u2019re trying to get them to help us? I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s a reliable idea though. The four large clans\u2014Lin, Bai, Murong, and Xiao\u2014although they\u2019re very influential within the Jianghu, they rarely get involved in matters of the Jianghu. They barely even participated in the martial arts conference.\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of bewilderment flashed through Baili Yu\u2019s eyes after he heard what she said. Although he had a feeling that the Xiao family could help them, after losing his memories, he had no idea what kind of help the Xiao family could provide. He didn\u2019t even know of the four large clans.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he had to hurry and recover his memories.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d When Baili Yu didn\u2019t respond, she poked her head out and glanced around at the people from the Xiao family in front of them. There were about seventeen of them and they were all currently looking at Xiao Sizhui worriedly. Meanwhile, Xiao Yi was standing awkwardly at the side and peeking over from time to time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

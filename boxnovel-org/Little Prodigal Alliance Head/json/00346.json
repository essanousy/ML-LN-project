She had never been an overly kind person, it was just that she had a conscience. Now that she had already delivered the warning, the rest had nothing to do with her.</p><br/><p>Just as she reached the door, the waiter suddenly recalled something and shouted to stop her. \u201cAunt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou stopped. Since the waiter had rushed into the water to greet her, she didn\u2019t want this waiter to die from drowning like this. She turned back. \u201cLittle waiter, do you want to go with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for over ten years. I\u2019ve seen water this high before, and no one has ever drowned. Aunt, you should just stay as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not leaving?\u201d Tang Doudou got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>The waiter shook his head, then said, \u201cAunt, I won\u2019t go, but if you\u2019re going to, you should bring Uncle with you. Although he\u2019s severely ill\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he brought this up, Tang Doudou immediately cursed at herself for being stupid and forgetting about this.</p><br/><p>However, there was no one inside the room, so how was she supposed to bring \u2018a person\u2019 with her?</p><br/><p>After a brief moment of thought, Tang Doudou made a pained expression. \u201cLook, I\u2019m already so old. It\u2019s hard just for me to get myself out, to bring another person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter had a pretty good impression of this aunt and was surprised to find out that she was actually this heartless. It really showed the truth of that saying, although a wife and husband were originally birds of the same forest, when calamity struck they would flee in separate directions!</p><br/><p>The waiter sighed. \u201cAunt, if you leave, that uncle will definitely die here!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, there was no need to even worry about drowning. Since that uncle was heavily ill with an infectious disease, if no one was there to look after him, he\u2019ll definitely die.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sighed. \u201cI understand everything you said, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cAunt, since you\u2019re insisting on leaving, you should bring the uncle with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou exposed a troubled expression. The waiter gritted his teeth and said, \u201cHow about this? Since it\u2019s raining so hard, there probably wouldn\u2019t be any more guests. The guests in the inn are also resting right now, so I\u2019ll go ask the innkeeper to let me take a break, then I\u2019ll help send you guys out. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fudge, can\u2019t that! Send them out? Where was she supposed to find a person for him to send out?</p><br/><p>A lot of the guests that had been woken up were now standing on the second floor corridor watching the waiter and Tang Doudou. The reason for it was simple. After being kept inside for so many days due to the rain, they were glad for any excuse to get out of their rooms for some air.</p><br/><p>Quite a few of these people were of the martial arts circles, so if she didn\u2019t bring someone with her or they figured out that there was no one in the room, they might become curious about why she had been lying.</p><br/><p>She still needed to stay in Green Maple City for a while, so that situation would be unfavorable.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go see the old man. If he wants to leave, I\u2019ll bring him with me. If he doesn\u2019t want to, then let him just stay here!\u201d When she saw that the waiter\u2019s expression was becoming even worse and filled with contempt, she paused, then said, \u201cIf this place isn\u2019t flooded by tomorrow, I\u2019ll come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, for the time being I\u2019ll have to trouble you to brew this medicine and bring it to the room along with the meals. Please put it inside through the small window next to the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter thought about it, then said, \u201cAlright, but make sure to come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, as long as this inn isn\u2019t flooded, I\u2019ll definitely come back. After all, that\u2019s the companion I\u2019ve spent over twenty years with. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I still have an elderly mother at home and there\u2019s a child in my belly, I\u2019d bring him along even if it meant certain death!\u201d When she saw that the waiter was that kind-hearted, she resorted to appealing to his empathy. At the same time, she became even more vexed. Why was this waiter so stubborn? Why did he insist on staying here?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like that!\u201d The waiter reacted with surprise and realization. He then patted his chest and said, \u201cAunt, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely send the uncle his food and medicine on time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, but no matter what, don\u2019t go in. It\u2019ll be troublesome if you get infected!\u201d Tang Doudou purposefully raised her volume. In ancient times, people avoided infectious diseases like they were snakes. Thus, after she said this, it was unlikely that anyone would dare to enter her room.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d The waiter then glanced at the pouring rain outside. \u201cAunt, why don\u2019t you wait until the rain lightens up a little before going? The rain\u2019s so heavy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have to hurry and leave while the water is still not that deep. Little waiter ah, since you\u2019re so good-hearted, this old lady will be nosy just one last time. You should hurry and pack up to leave as well! If something actually ends up happening, it\u2019d be too late for regret!\u201d After she said that, she strode out of the inn without hesitation.</p><br/><p>The waiter followed her to the inn\u2019s doors and saw that water was already overflowing the doorsteps. This had never happened before.</p><br/><p>\u201cInnkeeper, Innkeeper!\u201d The waiter hastily ran back inside to tell the innkeeper about this.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper went over to the door to take a look as well and frowned. He glanced up towards the sky. The rain showed no indication of coming to a stop. It was as if a hole had opened in the sky that was pouring water out nonstop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaiter, hurry and call all the neighbors out to discuss what to do!\u201d said the innkeeper.</p><br/><p>The waiter asked in confusion, \u201cWhy should we discuss with them? They definitely wouldn\u2019t believe either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more people, the more power. It\u2019s truly fortunate that the aunt earlier warned us. If it weren\u2019t for her, we might\u2019ve closed the doors and gone to sleep\u2026 Aiy, there\u2019s no time. I\u2019m going to go pack up, you should go call the people.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the innkeeper said this, the people inside the inn immediately started reconsidering their decisions. Quite a few went to look outside too. When they saw that the situation didn\u2019t look optimistic, they went in to pack up their things in preparation to leave.</p><br/><p>The waiter went to call the neighbors, then returned to the inn. As he watched the guests leave, his gaze landed on the room that Tang Doudou had stayed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Aaah!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you screaming for? Let\u2019s go!\u201d When the innkeeper saw that he was still inside that room and recalled that the aunt said her husband\u2019s illness was infectious, his face immediately paled.</p><br/><p>The waiter ran out. As he pointed at the room behind him, he stammered, \u201cI-in-innkeeper\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Spit it out already!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one inside!\u201d After the waiter said that, he ran downstairs. \u201cIt\u2019s completely empty, there\u2019s not a single person inside!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one?\u201d The innkeeper was confused for a moment, then he pulled the waiter over and quietly rebuked, \u201cSilly fool! Isn\u2019t it better that there\u2019s no one there? Hurry up and help me pack up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter scratched his head. He couldn\u2019t wrap his head around the fact that although there was supposed to be someone in there, there wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>However, he was simple-minded, so he didn\u2019t think much into it and started helping the innkeeper pack.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

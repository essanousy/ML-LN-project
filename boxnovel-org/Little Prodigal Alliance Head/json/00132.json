Why was she asking about his mouth out of nowhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did it take you so long to get here?\u201d Su Yi rolled his eyes at her, then said, \u201cCome with me, I have something to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it that you can\u2019t talk about here?\u201d There\u2019s no way she would agree to just casually follow him out like that. Who knew what strange things he might say again to shake her resolve.</p><br/><p>Su Yi glowered at her. \u201cI told you to come with me, so come with me! Quit wasting time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I go with you just because you tell me to, wouldn\u2019t my dignity as the martial arts Alliance Head be nonexistent?\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t care about his threatening glare at all and refused to budge.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Su Yi was angered to the point he was about to vomit blood. He pointed at this woman that couldn\u2019t differentiate good from bad and stuttered in rage, \u201cY-you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou curved her eyes in amusement. \u201cAiyah, Brother Su, don\u2019t get angry ah. What I mean is that you\u2019re a guest from far away so how could we just go to any random old place to talk? How about this? I\u2019ll act as host and take you to a teahouse where we can chat while drinking tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was actually going to be this considerate?</p><br/><p>Su Yi rolled his eyes and stood up. He dusted off his clothes and glanced at the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce signboard, then said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou headed back to notify the manager of the Chamber of Commerce before following Su Yi out.</p><br/><p>The entire way, Su Yi\u2019s expression was serious but he didn\u2019t say a word. Tang Doudou pondered what he came here for. From the looks of it, it was a pretty urgent matter. Contrary to that impression though, he was currently very calm. It was seriously strange ah!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had long since gotten familiar with the area and knew the location of the nearest teahouse. However, she purposefully led him towards the furthest teahouse in order to annoy him into revealing an impatient expression.</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s expression turned impatient several times but he forcefully suppressed it. Upon seeing this, Tang Doudou came to the conclusion that this matter was definitely very important. It would be a great sin if she ended up delaying a matter of such importance that human life was beyond value.</p><br/><p>In addition, she still wanted to ask for Su Yi\u2019s help so she couldn\u2019t afford to anger him too much. She looked around, then her eyes lit up. \u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi followed her gaze and looked over at the so-called teahouse. It was actually just a tattered tea vendor\u2019s stand?</p><br/><p>As expected, she was purposefully messing with him.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he knew she had lost her memories due to the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, he really would have just slapped her dead. That way would save him a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>It was currently dinnertime, so there weren\u2019t many people wandering the streets. The tea vendor\u2019s stall was completely empty so the boss was just lying there and teasing the housefly on the table out of boredom.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Boss, bring us two bowls of herb tea!\u201d Tang Doudou slapped the table, startling the boss and he hastily got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Guests, please sit, the herb tea will be up right away!\u201d The boss immediately became spirited upon finally getting some business. When he saw that the two didn\u2019t seem like ordinary citizens, he even used a cloth to wipe the bench and the table before inviting the two to sit down.</p><br/><p>Following that, he carried over two large bowls of herb tea for Tang Doudou and Su Yi. \u201cDear guests, take your time. Just call for me if you need anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave, we have matters to discuss!\u201d said Su Yi coldly as he threw down a silver ingot.</p><br/><p>The boss smiled like a flower when he saw the money and he hastily but securely tucked it away. \u201cYes, yes, yes. I\u2019ll leave right away!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he ran off and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many people on the street so once the boss left, the atmosphere surrounding the vendor stall immediately became heavy. Tang Doudou\u2019s heart suddenly started beating faster. She snuck a glance at Su Yi and, noticing that his expression was extremely solemn, couldn\u2019t help but start wondering why he was looking for her.</p><br/><p>Su Yi silently took a sip of the herb tea, then asked, \u201cYou met with that old man?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old man? What old man?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had not expected for this to be the first thing out of his mouth. She rubbed her chin and said, \u201cAre you talking about Cang Baicao? We did meet, what about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about another old man, I\u2019m talking about\u2013 about your grandpa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfff!\u201d Tang Doudou was so surprised she spurted her tea out all over Su Yi\u2019s face. She stood up and pointed at Su Yi as she asked, \u201cHow did you know!?\u201d</p><br/><p>A disdainful expression appeared in Su Yi\u2019s eyes. He pulled his sleeve and calmly wiped the tea off his face. \u201cOf course it\u2019s because he told me!\u201d</p><br/><p>That old man had knelt outside Cloud City for three days and three nights for the sake of asking him to come and look for Tang Doudou. He remembered that on that heavily raining night twenty years ago, that damned old man had also knelt that way outside Cloud City, begging him to take in this damned yatou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026. looked for you?\u201d Tang Doudou attempted to organize her thoughts. How come she couldn\u2019t really understand the situation?</p><br/><p>Three days ago, she had gone to Five Kilometers Emporium and met that old man.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Baili Yu appeared and took her away, saying that the old man was deceiving her. Following that, a large fire had burned the entire Five Kilometers Emporium to the ground. Even that book had been thrown by her into the fire and burned to ashes.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even know for sure if that person was really her grandpa. As of right now though, Su Yi had jumped out and said that the old man is her grandpa. Then doesn\u2019t that mean everything he said was true?</p><br/><p>And that the person actually lying to her was Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>Slap! Tang Doudou slapped this idea flying. That\u2019s not possible. Su Yi and that old man were definitely working together to trick her!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe told me everything. He said that you chose to trust Baili Yu over him, and it caused him to be greatly hurt. But no matter how hurt he was, he still couldn\u2019t leave you alone so he asked me to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came to find me just for this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Su Yi took another sip of tea. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a single word that old man says.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfff!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

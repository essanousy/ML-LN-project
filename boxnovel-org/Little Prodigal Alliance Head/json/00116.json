She really wasn\u2019t purposefully trying to seize the fatal points of the person surnamed Gu. What she wanted was very simple, you can\u2019t very well slap a smiling face, right? Since she can\u2019t beat them, of course she would use other methods!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s your territory, of course we\u2019ll listen to Brother Gu\u2019s arrangements! I\u2019m fine with going wherever Brother Gu wants to go!\u201d said Tang Doudou with a bright laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li is really a refreshing person. The matter should not be delayed, so why don\u2019t we head out now?\u201d That restaurant belonged to him so everyone in it were his subordinates. As long as Li Xueyi entered, regardless of how amazing his martial arts were, he\u2019d inevitably have to admit defeat!</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he made a \u2018please go ahead\u2019 gesture. Tang Doudou laughed \u2018hehe\u2019, then walked towards the outside of the courtyard with her arm still around his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Brother Gu and Xiao Bai are twins, why are your surnames different? I still have yet to ask what Brother Gu\u2019s given name is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was this Gu\u2019s neglectance. This one has Gu as a surname and Xun (search/look) as the sole given name. Although Elder Brother and I are twins, since young I have followed Father and he has followed Mother. Our family names are also according to our father and mother, respectively,\u201d explained Gu Xun with a smile.</p><br/><p>No one called him but Boss Suo decided on his own to follow them. He simply walked next to the two without a word.</p><br/><p>Skinny and Fatty couldn\u2019t join in the conversation either since they had been sent away by Boss Suo.</p><br/><p>The business transaction didn\u2019t succeed and so they didn\u2019t get any money. The moment Skinny walked out of the courtyard, he turned around and spat. In a low tone, he cursed, \u201cDamned bastard Old Suo, to even dare to kidnap the martial arts Alliance Head! Is he trying to cause lao zi\u2019s life to end early? Luckily lao zi was smart and spoke to that Alliance Head beforehand. Otherwise I\u2019d already be dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty didn\u2019t really understand what was going on but he was also very vexed about not getting any money. When he heard Skinny exclaim that in relief, he asked while scratching his head, \u201cSkinny, when did you talk with that Alliance Head?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I explain you wouldn\u2019t understand, just go over there!\u201d Skinny was in a bad mood and didn\u2019t feel like explaining.</p><br/><p>He lowered his head and thought for a while. It was unknown what he thought of but his expression suddenly turned excited and he turned around to look for Fatty in order to discuss his plan.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t see Fatty when he turned around. It had only been a few moments. Where did that idiot run off to?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

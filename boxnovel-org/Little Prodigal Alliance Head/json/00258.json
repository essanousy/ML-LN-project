She recalled when Mu Ye was trying to kill her in Rutaceae Pavilion. That situation had been so scary it felt like her guts had been destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou- what are you doing!?\u201d Nangong Yan who was originally still shouting haughtily became scared when she saw the emotionless killing intent in Mu Ye\u2019s eyes. She had been raised in an environment that completely pampered her, so no one had ever dared to look at her this way before.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay away! Stay away! I-, I\u2019ll drop this matter already!\u201d Even in the face of danger her tone didn\u2019t get any humbler. It was just that the fear coming from her very bones made her continuously retreat.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye has always had a cold temperament and was of few words. If it wasn\u2019t someone he knew, he wouldn\u2019t speak to them at all.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had already decided to kill Nangong Yan. However, he didn\u2019t directly rush up to take her life but took his time walking towards her. His steady steps sounded like the footsteps of the King of Hell; each soft thump seemed to make Nangong Yan\u2019s heart jump.</p><br/><p>The corridor was only so long and their rooms were the innermost ones, so Nangong Yan hadn\u2019t been able to retreat for long before she hit the cold wall.</p><br/><p>There was nowhere to retreat.</p><br/><p>Could it be that Mu Ye was actually going to kill Nangong Yan? Or was he just scaring her a little? After all, there were no past conflicts between the two. Even though she hated Nangong Yan to death, this had nothing to do with Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>However, Mu Ye seemed to know about the injury on her stomach. Since that was the case, did he also know that it was due to Nangong Yan?</p><br/><p>So right now, he was trying to get revenge for her?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you can\u2019t kill me! There\u2019s a decree in Saint City! Private armed confrontations and taking of lives are not allowed! You\u2026 If you kill me! You won\u2019t be able to escape either!\u201d Nangong Yan\u2019s fearful voice came again front that side.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou snapped out of her thoughts and looked over.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye was currently only a few steps away from Nangong Yan and towered over her as the sword in his hand emitted a faint cold light.</p><br/><p>She then noticed that hardly anyone in the inn was paying attention to this matter. Perhaps they felt that Nangong Yan had brought it on herself. The people staying here were probably already tired of her, or perhaps they didn\u2019t want to attract trouble to themselves and risk having their identities revealed.</p><br/><p>In any case, they were the only three in the corridor.</p><br/><p>However, she could see a black shadow behind the door of the room Murong Ming was staying in. It was doubtlessly Murong Ming. Although he probably kept it hidden from Wind Cloud Island that he brought Nangong Yan here, Liu Zhiyuan still knew!</p><br/><p>Could it be that Murong Ming wasn\u2019t worried that Liu Zhiyuan would report to the Master of Wind Cloud Island what happened after Nangong Yan was killed? There was no way his Murong family could survive facing Wind Cloud Island\u2019s fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yuan! Ah Yuan! Where the hell are you!? Hurry and save me!\u201d When Nangong Yan saw that Mu Ye was continuing to approach despite her threats, she was so scared she started crying for Liu Zhiyuan.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked around but didn\u2019t see any black-clothed people move. From the looks of it, Nangong Yan hadn\u2019t been able to find Liu Zhiyuan yesterday.</p><br/><p>Then, could it be that Nangong Yan was done for?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou knitted her brows. It didn\u2019t feel very likely.</p><br/><p>As expected, just as Nangong Yan was screaming Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s name like crazy and Mu Ye had clutched her neck, a blade suddenly appeared behind Mu Ye and flew towards his head.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was so alarmed, her heart practically leapt to her throat and she hastily shouted, \u201cMu Ye, be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye had abruptly turned around before Tang Doudou even shouted and shoved Nangong Yan in front of him as a shield. Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s sword froze right before it touched Nangong Yan\u2019s chest, then he forcefully retrieved it.</p><br/><p>A line of blood appeared from empty air, then Liu Zhiyuan slowly became visible.</p><br/><p>At this point, Nangong Yan had already fainted from fear.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye threw her aside like he was tossing an old rag as he kept his cold gaze on Liu Zhiyuan.</p><br/><p>Li Zhiyuan said, \u201cI already know who you are. It\u2019s not a good idea to attract trouble just to kill her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye lifted his hand. The blade in his hand glinted coldly as he prepared to attack again.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she silently rebuked herself for having stupidly shouted Mu Ye\u2019s name. As of now, even if he didn\u2019t kill Nangong Yan and Liu Zhiyuan, he\u2019d probably be targeted. However, if he killed them, he\u2019d have to face the Wind Cloud Island\u2019s fury!</p><br/><p>Most importantly, if they really killed someone, their identities would immediately be revealed.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d eventually settle the score with Nangong Yan, but right now wasn\u2019t the right time. In addition, Mu Ye was the person she didn\u2019t want to cause trouble for the most.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing what she said, Mu Ye glanced over at her. Then he looked at Liu Zhiyuan coldly before putting his sword away and walking towards her.</p><br/><p>If he had been alone just then, he would have already killed Nangong Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He reached Tang Doudou but his eyes were still cold.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t look at Liu Zhiyuan and Nangong Yan anymore. Nodding, she walked out of the inn with Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>Once they left the inn, Tang Doudou asked worriedly, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut everyone now knows that you\u2019re the famous Mu Ye\u2026\u201d If they continued staying at the inn, there\u2019d probably be people showing up to look for trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cArmed combat isn\u2019t allowed in Saint City. They can\u2019t either.\u201d Mu Ye suddenly looked towards her with probing in his cold eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let me kill her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Could it be that it didn\u2019t occur to him? Tang Doudou found it a little strange that Mu Ye would ask such a childish question. Those things had occurred even to a person as dumb as her.</p><br/><p>Although this was what she was thinking, she still told Mu Ye about everything she considered earlier.</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she seemed to see a hint of a smile flashed through Mu Ye\u2019s cold eyes. His expression turned gentler as his soft voice came from the black robe. \u201cSilly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he actually reached out and rubbed her head the way Jun Xin often did. A gentle warmth came from his large broad hand, but currently Tang Doudou\u2019s head was completely blank.</p><br/><p>By the time she came back to her senses, she found that there were black-robed people all around and that Mu Ye had disappeared!</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but want to cry. Why did these people love to suddenly disappear so much!?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then she forced herself to breathe evenly.</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open with a creak. Baili Yu\u2019s steps were a little unsteady. He had accidentally drank a little too much. He had only snapped out of it when the waiter came over and expressed concern.</p><br/><p>He was worried about Tang Doudou doing something out of anger so he couldn\u2019t be bothered to wait for the alcohol to fade and stumbled his way up the stairs.</p><br/><p>When he saw that Tang Doudou was sleeping peacefully, he sighed in relief and sat down next to the table. He poured himself a cup of tea to moisten his dry throat, then he exhaled. There wasn\u2019t much smell of alcohol, so he walked over to the bed.</p><br/><p>He stroked Tang Doudou\u2019s face longingly, and the human skin mask came off.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes whirled slightly with confusion. Why was he taking off her mask?</p><br/><p>The answer soon came.</p><br/><p>After Baili Yu took off her mask, he took off his as well. His slightly intoxicated peach flower eyes were stirring with some sort of emotion as he took in the peaceful sleeping face in front of him as if he could never get enough of it.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was because of the alcohol, or because it has been a long time since he had touched her, but after gazing at her face for a while, he couldn\u2019t hold himself back anymore. He slowly leaned over and approached Tang Doudou\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>Although she hadn\u2019t drunk, she looked as if she did. Her skin that was as white as porcelain was flushed a healthy peach pink like a ripe honey peach. The more one looked at it, the more tempting it was to just take a bite and let that sweet and soft sensation fill the mouth.</p><br/><p>The slight flutter of her soft eyelashes seemed to tickle Baili Yu\u2019s heart. He subconsciously gave a soft call, \u201cDoudou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou barely managed to stop herself from replying. Luckily she had been able to hold herself back since she wanted to see what he was up to, otherwise she definitely would\u2019ve kicked him flying.</p><br/><p>Although she wasn\u2019t opposed to getting intimate with him, for Baili Yu to do something to her while she was sleeping\u2026 No matter how she thought about it, it felt a bit vulgar.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu? Vulgar?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou really wanted to cry. How had those two words ended up being linked?</p><br/><p>Following that, she sensed Baili Yu\u2019s soft breath over her eyes, nose, mouth, and chin. It contained his usual distinctive smell along with the faint scent of alcohol.</p><br/><p>He actually went and drank!</p><br/><p>It was no wonder he ended up doing such a vulgar thing.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wanted to open her eyes, at the same time, deep in her heart she seemed to be anticipating something.</p><br/><p>Anticipating, anticipating\u2026 Fudge, she was actually anticipating for Baili Yu to do something vulgar!</p><br/><p>Baili Yu had no idea that the little beauty in front of him was awake. He kissed her so softly it felt like the brush of numerous feathers as he left kisses all over that enchanting face.</p><br/><p>His senses were filled with her smell. Baili Yu\u2019s self-restraint gradually weakened and he subconsciously started touching her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou\u2026\u201d He murmured softly, \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was also getting aroused due to his movements, but she forced herself to endure it. Her face was completely flushed from her struggle to remain motionless, but her lips refused to obey and parted slightly with a soft exhale.</p><br/><p>When she heard what he said, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from asking, \u201cWhat part?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery part?\u201d Baili Yu showed no surprise towards her sudden question. He replied as he kissed each part, \u201cYour brows are very beautiful, your eyes are also beautiful, your nose and mouth are beautiful too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you fall in love with me just because of my looks?\u201d asked Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu chuckled, then shifted his attention to her delicate ear. \u201cYes and no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Tang Doudou turned to her side so that he couldn\u2019t get her ear. \u201cSo you were actually such a shallow person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou, Wife\u2026\u201d Since she wouldn\u2019t let him have her ear, he should just seal this restless mouth instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmmphf\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou struggled to push Baili Yu away, but her resistance just made Baili Yu even more excited.</p><br/><p>He pulled her into his arms and while Tang Doudou was still out of it, moved on top of her. \u201cWife, be good. This husband will be gentle. I won\u2019t hurt you.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s face was bright red. She wasn\u2019t struggling to reject him, she just wanted to say something to him.</p><br/><p>But in the face of his onslaught of passion, no matter how much she wanted to say, she couldn\u2019t help but drown in his gentle embrace. As he slowly moved down, she could no longer think of anything else.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled when he saw that Tang Doudou was conceding to him. He reached back and tugged softly, then the heavy curtain parted them from the rest of the room.</p><br/><p>One area was cold and quiet, while the other was hot as flames.</p><br/><p>At night, Tang Doudou woke up, her body sore all over. When she looked up, she saw that Baili Yu\u2019s arm was on top of her, so she gently moved it away.</p><br/><p>She had done it very carefully, but Baili Yu still ended up waking up.</p><br/><p>He opened his eyes and looked towards her sleepily. \u201cWife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, I didn\u2019t wake you on purpose. Why don\u2019t you go back to sleep?\u201d Tang Doudou was captivated by the sight of his beautiful eyes for a moment. When she snapped out of it, she gave a soft cough and quickly replied.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu played with Tang Doudou\u2019s hair silently for a while. \u201cWife, I might need to leave for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou abruptly sat up. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t be so stirred up. I\u2019m only leaving for a few days to investigate something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we go together?\u201d Tang Doudou was scared. She looked towards Baili Yu and asked, \u201cAre you already tired of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Baili Yu sealed those lips that always spoke nonsense for a while before reluctantly releasing them. \u201cLately, a few particular scenes keeps surfacing in my mind. I want to figure out what exactly they are so that maybe I could recover some of my memories.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let me go with you, alright?\u201d Tang Doudou pouted. Although this was what Baili Yu said, she felt that he was keeping things from her. He was definitely annoyed with her strange temper lately.</p><br/><p>After all, the novels and the TV dramas she saw before were all like this.</p><br/><p>When two people were dating, everything was perfect, but once they got married, all sorts of problems would pop up.</p><br/><p>Having different daily habits and differences in opinion caused large fights over the littlest things.</p><br/><p>Although Baili Yu had yielded to her about everything, doted on her, and was very attentive during this past period\u2026 allowing her to comfortably live as a little princess, she knew that a person\u2019s patience was limited. It was even easier for a problem to occur when one side was always the giving party.</p><br/><p>However, she really loved the feeling of being pampered and protected. Perhaps it was because she had been an orphan. Although later, there was Grandpa to take care of her, most of the time, she had to live on her own since Grandpa had to work in order to pay her tuition.</p><br/><p>After she got here, a lot of people took very good care of her, but she still had her guard up against everyone. Baili Yu was the only one she never guarded against. That was why, whenever Baili Yu treated her well, she would be struck with the feeling that she never wanted to lose him.</p><br/><p>Especially now, when Baili Yu said that he was going to leave, she felt like the sky was collapsing on her and she was overwhelmed with fear.</p><br/><p>In front of Baili Yu, she never bothered to pretend. Even if she feigned calm, there was nothing that Baili Yu\u2019s sharp eyes couldn\u2019t see through. He sensed her fear and panic, so he pulled her tightly into his arms. \u201cThose places are too dangerous. I can\u2019t allow you risk such danger with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou trembled in his arms. She greedily took in his warmth and buried her face in his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silently, in her heart, she added: What I\u2019m scared of is that you\u2019ll never come back.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu gently patted her back as he comforted her. \u201cBut I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared that something might happen to you. If anything did happen, I\u2019d blame myself until I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ll be fine going, I\u2019ll definitely be fine. I know martial arts, so I can protect myself. Please let me go!\u201d When Tang Doudou got to the end, her voice was filled with a sobbing tone.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s heart squeezed with pain. He lifted her face and kissed away the tears in her eyes. It was a little bitter and salty. He sighed softly, not knowing what to do.</p><br/><p>In reality, if he had a choice, he wouldn\u2019t leave at this sort of time. However, those scenes he was seeing would likely help him recover his lost memories and they seemed to be crucially linked to these current events. It would probably tell him why Yun Hai betrayed him.</p><br/><p>He subconsciously sensed that regardless of whether it was Feng Long, Jun Xin, or Yun Hai, there was no way any of them would betray him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t agree to that. This is responsibility. As your husband, I have a responsibility to protect you. And because of that responsibility, regardless of whether I live or die, or even if all I have left is a breath of life, I\u2019ll still return to your side. So please trust in me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t expected for Baili Yu to be so determined. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say anything about going through life or death together anymore. She softly pushed him away and turned around to lie down, then silently closed her eyes. If he wanted to leave, just leave. He could return if he wanted, in any case, he made the decisions. He could just treat the fact that she had spent so long searching for him as her repaying the past times he had saved her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was angry, but Baili Yu could only look on helplessly. If she didn\u2019t have that child in her belly, he definitely wouldn\u2019t leave without her, but with this current situation\u2026</p><br/><p>He sighed and lay down as well. As he stared at the black curtains above them, a trace of confusion flashed through his eyes. What had his past been like? Why did it feel like he wanted to run away from those memories?</p><br/><p>Could it be that his past was so terrible he didn\u2019t want to recall it even subconsciously?</p><br/><p>After Tang Doudou lay down for a while and Baili Yu didn\u2019t continue to try to comfort her, she immediately started regretting. She knew that she was kicking up a senseless fuss again, after all, there was no way that two people could stay together forever without even parting a bit. Giving each other enough room was the best way to interact.</p><br/><p>She understood the logic, but doing it was really hard.</p><br/><p>They shared the same bed that night, but they had very different thoughts.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t sleep at all. Both of them were feeling regret and wanted to clear things up, but they didn\u2019t know how to start.</p><br/><p>So they just lay there motionlessly with their eyes open until morning.</p><br/><p>Even when the sun rose, neither of them moved.</p><br/><p>After quite a while, the waiter knocked on the door. \u201cGuests, are you awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was how the stuffy atmosphere was finally broken. The two shared a glance, then quickly looked away again.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuests? Are you guys in there? Did something happen?\u201d When the waiter got no response, he called out again in concern.</p><br/><p>When they heard this, they instantly understood. The shopkeeper had seen them enter the room yesterday afternoon, but they hadn\u2019t left or called for any food today, so he probably got worried that something had happened to them and sent the waiter up to check.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou\u2019s thoughts reached this point, she took the initiative to say, \u201cWe\u2019re fine, we just overslept a little. Thanks for your concern!\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter stopped himself from knocking again and said with a smile, \u201cAlright, since you guys are fine, I won\u2019t disturb your rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard!\u201d replied Tang Doudou. Then she pointedly ignored the person behind her and put on her shoes and her human skin mask before opening the door.</p><br/><p>The waiter was about to leave, but when he heard the sound of the door opening, he turned around and smiled towards her. \u201cDid I disturb your rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all, it was thanks to your reminder that we woke up. We almost overslept and neglected an important matter.\u201d Tang Doudou pulled out a piece of loose silver and pressed it into his hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to trouble you to bring up our breakfast.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

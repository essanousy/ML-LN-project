Starting to speak once again, Elder Yu\u2019s tone was quite casual, seeming to have no hidden intentions as he asked, \u201cWhat, does Bai gongzi recognize this person?\u201d</p><br/><p>His one sentence directed everyone\u2019s attention to Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t recognize.\u201d Bai Feiyun slowly withdrew his gaze and indifferently replied.</p><br/><p>But Elder Yu simply had no intention of letting him go just like that this time. Giving a few seemingly candid laughs, he said, \u201cFrom the look of Bai gongzi\u2018s expression, I thought you guys knew each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just surprised that someone would sleep here.\u201d Bai Feiyun explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Elder Yu got up. His physique was very burly, his facial features rough-hewn. Sitting down, it couldn\u2019t be felt but the moment he stood up he would give off an enormous oppressive feeling. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that Bai gongzi\u2018s relationship with Cloud City was rather good and that you also had friendly relations with that Li Xueyi. Is this indeed true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nice move. After winding around such a big circle, he\u2019s finally gotten to the main point.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu\u2019s words once again pushed Bai Feiyun onto the chopping board. Everyone\u2019s line of sight all turned towards Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Yet Bai Feiyun was still as unperturbed as before. Facing all those questioning eyes, he calmly smiled as he explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Wind Manor and Cloud City have had dealings since ancient times, to describe the relation as good, it\u2019s not good, but to describe it as bad, it\u2019s not bad either\u2026. As for Li Xueyi, I have met him a few times but it can\u2019t be quite called friendship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWonder what Elder Yu means for asking this at this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Bai Feiyun explained, it caused all those doubts to disappear. White Wind Manor had always done business. It had pretty good relationships with many sects in Jianghu and its dealings with Cloud City was also something that everyone knew of.</p><br/><p>Since they have dealings with Cloud City, having met Li Xueyi a few times can be considered quite normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, no other meaning, it was just a bit of curiosity, that\u2019s all!\u201d Elder Yu broke into a laugh. From the start, he didn\u2019t expect to be able to direct everyone\u2019s criticism towards Bai Feiyun with one sentence.</p><br/><p>It was just that, to find out Li Xueyi\u2019s current whereabouts, there was no other method but to start here at Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>After those damned Demonic Sect people failed, they even took the only portrait they had of Li Xueyi with them. Otherwise, he also wouldn\u2019t be this passive. But if White Wind Manor wasn\u2019t handled carefully, it would cause his entire body to be marked by smell*!</p><br/><p>Comes from a complete saying: , Couldn\u2019t eat the lamb meat, yet caused the entire body to smell. Refers to a thief that wanted to steal a lamb but failed, and now he\u2019s easy to track because he stinks of lamb.</p><br/><p>On the Jianghu, the White Wind Manor\u2019s position was only second to the Alliance Head.</p><br/><p>As he thought on, he looked towards Xiao Yiyun.</p><br/><p>The latter understood immediately and asked Bai Feiyun, \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no friendship, Li Xueyi is someone of Cloud City. At this time he has run into misfortune and his whereabouts are unknown, did Bai gongzi never think of assembling some manpower in order to search for him? It seems like the Master of Rutaceae Pavilion and Bai gongzi also have friendly relations, not to mention Bai gongzi was also in charge of the security of this place. Is Bai gongzi not afraid that after this incident, Cloud City will seek you out to settle the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably that Bai gongzi doesn\u2019t know that Li Xueyi is the Cloud City City Lord\u2019s precious heart, if something really has happened to him\u2026 tsk tsk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiyun\u2019s last sentence stirred up another ten thousand waves in the hall. If this is actually true, it\u2019s really rather a bit way too stimulating.</p><br/><p>It must be known that the Lord of Cloud City and Li Xueyi were both men ah!</p><br/><p>No wonder Xiao Yiyun was so averse towards the Cloud City\u2019s Lord. There was actually such a reason. Anyone that was a man would have trouble accepting this matter! Not to mention the fact that the Lord of Cloud City was still placed above everyone in Jianghu!</p><br/><p>Thinking this, everyone present all started getting agitated.</p><br/><p>The coldly mocking female nun that spoke earlier was the first one to jump out this time. Pointing at Xiao Yiyun, she angrily said, \u201cXiao Yiyun, what evidence do you have to say this? If you don\u2019t have any evidence, I advise you best talk less!\u201d</p><br/><p>The current appearance of the female nun was as if Xiao Yiyun snatched away the person she had a crush on; it was completely livid.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s lips twitched. My god, this martial arts convention sure is hell of a lot of excitement!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Azure Water Valley, which has always been very peaceful and quiet, was so clamorous that it sounded like the food market.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah! Who the heck is it!? So loud!</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how she pulled the blankets over her head and burrowed into the pillows, she couldn\u2019t block out that racket.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu had also headed out to go somewhere early this morning. There were two doormen in Azure Water Valley but they were only in charge of guarding the doors and wouldn\u2019t do anything aside from that. Since Azure Water Valley was quite large, the fact that there were no servants was very inconvenient.</p><br/><p>During the past week, she had been in charge of all the food here. Fortunately, Baili Yu had nothing to do and would help, otherwise she really would have been exhausted to death.</p><br/><p>Last night, she had been in a good mood so she made a huge feast. She was so tired out that her waist and back ached, so she had been planning on sleeping in today, but these people were making such a racket that she had no way of sleeping. It was seriously infuriating! What exactly were those people doing!?</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>She abruptly sat up on the bed and threw off the blankets. She couldn\u2019t take it anymore!</p><br/><p>She got off the bed in preparation to head out and demand for an explanation when she saw someone standing at the window out of the corner of her eye. If she hadn\u2019t happened to glance that way, she would\u2019ve completely missed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye?\u201d When she got a clear look at him, she immediately went over. \u201cAre you looking for me for something?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been in Azure Water Valley this entire time.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye turned around, then glance towards the outside. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t catch on. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you. Why\u2019re you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>A sharp light flashed through Mu Ye\u2019s cold eyes and his tone also turned a little cold. \u201cThey\u2019re here to bring you back so that you continue being the alliance head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfff!\u201d What?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou dug out her ear, then moved closer to Mu Ye and waved her hand in front of his eyes. \u201cHey, are you really awake? Are you sleep-talking in broad daylight? What do you mean by making me continue being the alliance head? And, haven\u2019t I always been the alliance head? When did someone take over my title?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye didn\u2019t answer and instead asked, \u201cDo you still want to be the alliance head?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh, she really hadn\u2019t thought about this before.</p><br/><p>Now that she thought about it, she hadn\u2019t been a competent alliance head at all. It was no wonder that Xiao Bai would turn traitor. After all, she had pushed all the duties off to him without even giving him any benefits.</p><br/><p>If it was her, she would turn traitor too, and she\u2019d be even more harsh about it.</p><br/><p>Pei pei! She still didn\u2019t know for sure if Xiao Bai had betrayed her yet so it was best not to think along those lines\u2026 Tang Doudou patted her cheeks to get rid of some of the drowsiness. \u201cThe people outside are from the martial arts community?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really going to just leave the Demonic Sect?\u201d In this world though, it wasn\u2019t only that she was a bad alliance head. This Demonic Sect leader was also absent from post quite a lot!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only way to deal with these people is if Baili Yu shows himself,\u201d said Mu Ye. \u201cHowever, I saw him leave the valley early this morning. He probably won\u2019t be back for a long while, so for the time being, don\u2019t head out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou scratched her head. Baili Yu had left the valley? To do what? Why didn\u2019t he tell her? Could it be that he was off to do something dangerous again and didn\u2019t want her to worry?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t right though?</p><br/><p>While they were in the valley, he had left most tasks to Ye Chuan. Could it be that something unexpected occurred that he had to personally deal with?</p><br/><p>But, she couldn\u2019t keep him by her side all the time after all. She wasn\u2019t a cripple either so she should deal with this herself.</p><br/><p>The racket outside was still growing. Leaving it wasn\u2019t a solution. After thinking about it for a moment, she got up.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye looked over to see her pushing open the door. \u201cI can\u2019t just hide behind him all the time. After all, there\u2019s no way that he\u2019d always be by my side to protect me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She always thought this way whenever something happened to her, but her lazy personality and her habit of running away from things always made it so that she never got up the conviction to make decisions.</p><br/><p>After this last incident though, she finally understood.</p><br/><p>To stand firmly on this Jianghu, she had to have her own capital and ability, otherwise, other people would just keep taking advantage of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Why? You don\u2019t support me?\u201d Tang Doudou glanced over at him and giggled. \u201cAre you worried that I\u2019ll raid your sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demonic Sect has already been disbanded,\u201d replied Mu Ye mildly.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was shocked. \u201cWhat? Why did you disband it all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for it to exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had to admit that he was bold!</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy to establish the Demonic Sect, and he had disbanded so casually. It was a bit of a pity.</p><br/><p>Pei! What was she thinking?</p><br/><p>Leaving aside the discussion of Mu Ye, the Demonic Sect had done quite a lot of things to harm the martial arts community and the commoners. It was a good thing that a sect like this was disbanding, what had she been thinking?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s disbanded, it\u2019s disbanded. Don\u2019t worry about it. The world is large, and with how capable you are, there\u2019s no need to worry about not being able to\u2026\u201d Wait, something was off! When she had been in Huai City earlier, she hadn\u2019t heard about the Demonic Sect disbanding. So why so suddenly?</p><br/><p>She looked at Mu Ye again and asked, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hidden guards of the Demonic Sect will belong to you from now on.\u201d Mu Ye placed a tiny human skull on Tang Doudou\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The skull emitted faint light in the soft dawn sunlight. At its tip, there was a red string that tied in the style of a bracelet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that it\u2019ll be able to help you.\u201d Mu Ye\u2019s tone was cold as always, but if one listened carefully, it wasn\u2019t hard to heard the reluctance in his voice.</p><br/><p>He had to leave now, to find relative\u2019s blood for her.</p><br/><p>He had considered what Senior Cang said, but he couldn\u2019t have Tang Doudou take such a risk with him before he got concrete information.</p><br/><p>He had already given the antidote to the poison to Cang Baicao so Cang Baicao would know what to do if the situation got bad.</p><br/><p>After this incident, Baili Yu probably also understood that matters weren\u2019t as simple as they seemed so he would become even more cautious about Tang Doudou\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>He had personally trained the hidden guards of the Demonic Sect. They\u2019ve followed him for many years, so they would protect her well.</p><br/><p>That was why, this time, he was going to leave without hesitation even though he didn\u2019t know when he would be able to come back.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was still stunned by the news of the hidden guards of the Demonic Sect, so she didn\u2019t notice the reluctance in his tone. However, she did realize that he was about to leave and reflexively asked, \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo go where?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou faintly felt that he was leaving due to something related to her. \u201cIs it something related to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re about to leave, so can\u2019t you give me a couple more words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was annoyed and squeezed the skull. She felt like this guy was pissing her off on purpose.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

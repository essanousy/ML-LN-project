Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s definitely not related to this matter. I just need to ask him some private questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>This explanation didn\u2019t quite match up. Lian er was just a courtesan, what was there about him that could\u2019ve caught Tang Doudou\u2019s eye?</p><br/><p>In addition, Lian er was very petty and had a dirty mouth, yet he always liked to act very delicate and sweet. Although the guests liked him, none of the people in this brothel liked him.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun had a faint recollection of this courtesan because he had almost driven him out of Wind Cherishing House for being audacious and refusing to follow orders.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t understand what exactly Tang Doudou liked about Lian er. Jin Yi had also informed him that Tang Doudou had asked for Lian er in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>However, because she was asleep, they didn\u2019t actually see each other and a strange person had kicked Lian er down the stairs.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, who was that person?</p><br/><p>Gu Xun looked around, then his gaze stopped on the screen. Was he in there?</p><br/><p>It was probably Jun Xin. There was no one else he knew of that would follow Tang Doudou so closely.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Gu? What are you looking at?\u201d asked Tang Doudou curiously when she saw that his attention was focused on the screen.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun retrieved his gaze. \u201cAhem, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled and didn\u2019t press him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Alliance Head Li insists on heading out, I won\u2019t stop you. Time is tight so I\u2019ll go call Lian er up for you right now, and then I\u2019ll help you two leave Wind Cherishing House quietly.\u201d As Gu Xun got up, he glanced towards the screen again.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll be troubling you, Boss Gu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be so polite, Alliance Head Li. It\u2019s just an exchange. I just hope that Alliance Head Li won\u2019t forget what you\u2019ve promised me.\u201d Gu Xun walked past the screen and glanced behind it, but he didn\u2019t see anyone there. He furrowed his brows in confusion. He had clearly sensed someone behind the screen earlier, so why was there no one there?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Boss Gu, as long as I get to Huai City safely, I\u2019ll naturally fulfill the promise.\u201d It was a different story if there was no way to get back safely.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun nodded with a smile, then left.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou watched him leave, then silently sunk into thought for a while. She walked behind the screen and saw that Jun Xin was sprawled out there sleeping.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Jun Xin right here?</p><br/><p>Why did Gu Xun look as if he hadn\u2019t seen him?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like your guess was wrong.\u201d Baili Yu sat up and leaned against the head of the bed.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded, then shook her head. \u201cNo, my feeling\u2019s definitely right. Gu Xun can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe stinkin\u2019 woman is right for once. It\u2019s best not to trust these Bai family siblings. Gu Xun isn\u2019t a good person, and Bai Feiyun is no better.\u201d Jun Xin walked out from behind the screen. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you guys will be able to get back by relying on Gu Xun, so I\u2019m going to head out to arrange things. You guys should be careful, especially you. Why are you heading out for no reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to look for Lin Shuxuan,\u201d said Tang Doudou in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Shuxuan? Who\u2019s that?\u201d Jun Xin didn\u2019t know about the things that had happened recently so he didn\u2019t know who Lin Shuxuan is.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said, \u201cHe\u2019s a rich kid that I met here in Hibiscus Garrison. He has quite some influence here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much influence could someone from a tiny place like this have?\u201d Jun Xin showed his disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t look down on him. He\u2019ll come in very useful in helping us leave.\u201d Tang Doudou giggled without explaining further.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin curled his lips disdainfully. \u201cAlright, then look after yourself, I\u2019m leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not long after Jun Xin left, Lian er came upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li.\u201d After Lian er walked in, he glanced at Tang Doudou timidly. \u201cDoes Alliance Head Li have instructions for Lian er?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin and glanced behind her. When Lian er walked in, Baili Yu had lay back down. From the even breathing sounds, it seemed he had fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian er ah! You said that you had grown up in Wind Cherishing House, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian er didn\u2019t know why she asked this, but he replied in the usual way, \u201cEn, most of the courtesans here had grown up in Wind Cherishing House.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the courtesans that were here while you guys were still children? Where did they go? Why haven\u2019t I seen any of them?\u201d asked Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Lian er froze. Tang Doudou explained, \u201cI heard someone say that Wind Cherishing House has been here for twenty years already, but you guys look only fourteen at most. So who worked here while you guys were still children? It couldn\u2019t be that Wind Cherishing House waited until you guys grew up to start taking customers, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Alliance Head Li, why are you asking about this?\u201d Lian er exclaimed in surprise, seeming stunned by Tang Doudou\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking casually. Just answer me honestly. If you answer well, this Alliance Head has a big reward for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li, you\u2019re clearly making things hard for this servant on purpose! I was so little back then, how could I possibly remember?\u201d Lian er pouted unhappily.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou brushed back her head and said apologetically, \u201cIt was my neglectance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian er glanced over at Baili Yu out of the corner of his eye. When he saw that Baili Yu was asleep, he slowly moved closer to Tang Doudou and asked sweetly, \u201cCould it be that Alliance Head Li called this servant over only to ask these boring questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t push him away so he fell into her arms. \u201cAlliance Head Li, this night is so quiet and boring. Why not allow Lian er to dance for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDance?\u201d Tang Doudou shook her head. \u201cNo, I have another task for you, but Lian er, will you be able to bear this responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian er\u2019s brows furrowed slightly. This was the martial arts alliance head, how could a courtesan like him help her with anything?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Silently cursing, she headed towards the carriage entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cSteward Ding, have we left the city?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already outside the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gave Baili Yu a sweet smile. \u201cI\u2019m going outside to enjoy the breeze. You\u2019re ill so just rest properly!\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to see if Baili Yu agreed. In a flash, she left the carriage.</p><br/><p>As expectedly, the scene outside was already of open fields and villages in picturesque disorder. When Tang Doudou turned around to look back, Huai City was only a vague outline. The carriage sped along the broad road. Steward Ding seemed about eighty but was abnormally spirited. When he saw Tang Doudou come out, he lifted his whip and struck the horse before asking with a candid smile, \u201cHow should I address lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m Tang Doudou. You can just call me Doudou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou? That\u2019s a rather cute name.\u201d Steward Ding glanced at Tang Doudou\u2019s bright smile and petite face, then nodded his head approvingly. This girl was not bad looking. Her vivid and lively eyes were particularly likable and her personality was pretty good. Her straightforward words were rather refreshing, and the most important point was that she\u2019s female!</p><br/><p>She\u2019s countless times better than that Li Xueyi who didn\u2019t seem like a girl but was not quite a man either. Now that Master has left Huai City, Master has completely parted ways with that Li Xueyi so he can finally be released from his worries.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa Ding, look. Who\u2019s that in front?\u201d Tang Doudou was just about to start chatting with Steward Ding when she saw a figure appear in front.</p><br/><p>Steward Ding hastily pulled the reins. \u201cYuT/N\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The carriage stopped in front of that person. Only then was Tang Doudou able to see that person clearly. Standing there was a young man in his twenties wearing a light green brocade garment with a bamboo flute at his waist. His looks were rather like sunshine. When he saw the carriage stop, he immediately revealed a mouthful of white teeth and smiled to the point his eyes curved into lines.</p><br/><p>This smile not only befuddled Tang Doudou, even Steward Ding felt a little puzzled.</p><br/><p>Because neither of them recognized this young man.</p><br/><p>Steward Ding glanced at the carriage behind him. When his master didn\u2019t give any instructions, Steward Ding opened his mouth to ask, \u201cThis gongzi is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he even finished speaking, that young man waved his hand and, with a decidedly familiar attitude, said, \u201cOld Steward can just call me Su Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, so it\u2019s Su gongzi. Wonder what you blocked our carriage for?\u201d Although Steward Ding was old, he had helped Baili Yu manage businesses for half his life. Thus, he was extremely experienced in dealing with people. His attitude towards this stranger that had blocked the carriage was good-natured but appropriately alienated.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at him without speaking.</p><br/><p>Su Yi said, \u201cI must ask Old Steward to let your family\u2019s master know that I have something to negotiate with him about.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knows Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin, expressing doubt. Not to mention, Baili Yu didn\u2019t react at all so it would be strange if they knew each other.</p><br/><p>As expected, she heard Steward Ding say, \u201cMy apologies, Su gongzi. My family\u2019s master is not seeing any guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yi just smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You only have to pass this item over for your master to view. He\u2019ll definitely be happy to see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he reached inside his broad sleeve and dug around. However, even after a long time, nothing was dug out.</p><br/><p>Steward Ding exposed an expression of impatience.</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s expression also became embarrassed as he switched to digging around in the other sleeve. \u201cAhem, sorry, I forgot which side I put it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was speechless. Was this guy here to perform gags?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

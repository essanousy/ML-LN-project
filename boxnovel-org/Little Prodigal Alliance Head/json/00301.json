Don\u2019t support theft. \ud83d\ude42</p><br/><p>Early the next morning, Bai Feiyun came to pay a visit.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had a servant lead him over. He then proceeded to wring out a handkerchief and wiped Tang Doudou\u2019s face, her hands\u2026 He gently coaxed her into opening her eyes.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s body had self-awareness. Last night, he had also coaxed her into going to sleep the same way.</p><br/><p>When Bai Feiyun arrived, Jun Xin was already feeding her porridge. One small spoonful at a time, he gently coaxed her into opening her mouth and eating the food.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was shocked by this scene. \u201cShe\u2019s awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin turned around and made a shush motion towards him before continuing to feed Tang Doudou porridge.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun understood what he meant and stood outside in the courtyard to wait.</p><br/><p>After a while, Jun Xin came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jun\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe seems to still retain some consciousness. When I talk to her about simple things, she can understand and she can also do basic movements.\u201d Jun Xin told Bai Feiyun about everything he had observed while taking care of Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t trust Bai Feiyun, but Tang Doudou still needed Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was silent for a while before he replied with his usual gentle smile, \u201cIt seems like Alliance Head\u2019s situation isn\u2019t as bad as we thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Jun Xin\u2019s face lit up with joy. He had thought the same thing as he was coaxing Tang Doudou to sleep yesterday, but he had been worried that he was being too optimistic.</p><br/><p>Now that he got a confirmation from Bai Feiyun, he felt much more relieved and asked, \u201cThen what do we do next? Do we still need to find something that can stimulate her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely need. Although the situation looks promising, over time, her condition will get worse. If she stays in this state too long, it\u2019d be difficult for her to wake up even if she wanted to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that means the sooner she can recover, the better?\u201d Jun Xin furrowed his brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn. I looked through the ancient records yesterday. Does Young Master Jun have any subordinates who are skilled in the technique of vocal mimicry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do!\u201d Jun Xin looked at Bai Feiyun. \u201cYou\u2019ve figured out a way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn. If possible, Young Master Jun, please invite the person over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Jun Xin nodded and had walked a few steps away when he suddenly turned back.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun asked softly, \u201cDoes Young Master Jun still have questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope Bai gongzi won\u2019t spread the news about Baili Yu,\u201d said Jun Xin in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Young Master Jun. Feiyun isn\u2019t someone that can\u2019t tell the severity of situations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin nodded. If this matter wasn\u2019t related to Tang Doudou, Bai Feiyun\u2019s promise to stay silent couldn\u2019t be completely trusted. However, since this matter was related to Tang Doudou, Jun Xin was pretty certain that he wouldn\u2019t spread this incident around.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this matter is linked to the fact of Baili Yu\u2019s death, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t call the person skilled in mimicry over,\u201d said Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s smile faded. \u201cIt was my negligence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll go learn how to mimicry, then Bai gongzi can just tell me what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go learn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just mimicking voices. How could something like that stump me?\u201d said Jun Xin with a confident laugh. Following that, he took off the jade tablet that was attached to his waist and placed it in Bai Feiyun\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble Bai gongzi to look after Doudou for a while. I\u2019ll return by nightfall!\u201d</p><br/><p>As of now, what else could he say?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun naturally agreed. As he watched Jun Xin leave with large strides, his gaze gradually dimmed and he murmured, \u201cHalf a day? That\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then walked into the room.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling who had come to visit Tang Doudou had hidden in the nearby shrubs when she saw Bai Feiyun and Jun Xin talking. After Bai Feiyun went inside, she slowly got up from her hiding spot. Setting Jun Xin aside for now, this Bai Feiyun\u2026</p><br/><p>What was he up to?</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling decided to see what he was doing and with a light leap, she landed on the roof. She then carefully lifted a roof tile to look inside.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was currently checking Tang Doudou\u2019s pulse. His relaxed and gentle features were extremely elegant.</p><br/><p>Someone like this probably wasn\u2019t a bad person, right?</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling wondered if she had overthought things. After all, Bai Feiyun was her sister-in-law\u2019s subordinate and a trusted aid of City Lord Su, so he probably wouldn\u2019t do anything to Sister-in-Law.</p><br/><p>Despite having these thoughts, she continued watching.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had already been sent away with an excuse, so Bai Feiyun thought he was completely alone. He had no idea that there was now another person in Plum Garden that liked spying on people from the roof.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t like noise or being watched by people, so even the hidden guards had been arranged to be far away from this place. That was why Bai Feiyun thought that with Jun Xin gone, he was alone with Tang Doudou in this courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head?\u201d Bai Feiyun lifted Tang Doudou and pulled her into his arms.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling was shocked. Could this Bai Feiyun be a beast in disguise?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s body was currently completely weak and limp. When she was lifted up, her head drooped to the side. She looked like a soulless puppet.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun lifted his hand,pulling out the long slender needle stuck below her armpit and threw it aside.</p><br/><p>He had inserted this needle yesterday after getting Jun Xin to leave. Originally, he had wanted to ask his questions yesterday, but he was still worried about Jun Xin overhearing his questions.</p><br/><p>After he took out the needle, Tang Doudou abruptly opened her eyes, before starting to cough violently. \u201cCough cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, can you hear me?\u201d Bai Feiyun asked in a lowered voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough, Xiao? Xiao Bai?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. Alliance Head, I used a secret method to stimulate your consciousness. For the time being, you\u2019ll be awake for fifteen minutes.\u201d Bai Feiyun pulled her back into his arms as he explained softly.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s eyelids felt very heavy. She wanted to open them, but couldn\u2019t lift them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll do all I can to allow you to wake up as soon as possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t want, to wake up. Just let me go, please.\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s thoughts were evidently very alert right now.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun furrowed his brows. It seemed that she was resolute in not waking up. He shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, there\u2019s not much time. Feiyun has one very important question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2026 ask\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun hesitated for a second, then asked slowly, \u201cAlliance Head, where did you put the Alliance Head Command Tablet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Alliance Head\u2026 Command Tablet?\u201d Tang Doudou furrowed her brows in thought. \u201cI-I\u2026 I put it\u2026 where?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Feiyun heard that she didn\u2019t know either, his gentle expression became a bit flustered. \u201cThe City Lord needs the tablet. Alliance Head, please try your best to recall where you put it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t remember.\u201d Tang Doudou lifted her hand to try and push Bai Feiyun away. \u201cY-you, you guys, don\u2019t try to save me anymore. I-I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou fell back onto the bed. Her eyes were still open, but they were once again dull and lifeless.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun sighed, then gently shifted her into a more comfortable position and covered her with the blanket.</p><br/><p>He then checked her pulse again. When he saw that everything was normal, he stood up and walked out of the room with his hands folded behind his back.</p><br/><p>Once he left, Baili Yiling jumped off the roof as well to land on the other side of the courtyard. She narrowed her eyes. What did Su Yi want the Alliance Head Command Tablet for?</p><br/><p>Just as she was digesting what she had just heard, a neutral but still very charming voice came from behind her. \u201cThis subordinate greets Eldest Miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

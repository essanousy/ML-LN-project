If Lady Doudou has something to say, then you can just tell me.\u201d The maid\u2019s name was Qing Yu and her personality was quite cheerful. </p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just casually asking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu seemed to be needing more and more sleep recently. Sometime soon, she had to find Cang Baicao and ask him exactly how she was supposed to cure that Hoarfrost Poison.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Doudou, are you still planning to have your breakfast inside the room?\u201d asked Qing Yu after Tang Doudou finished washing up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just eat inside the room.\u201d Tang Doudou was puzzled by Qing Yu\u2019s question. There were no tables in the inn\u2019s hall. If she didn\u2019t eat inside her room, then could it be that she should go outside and crouch at the doorway to eat? </p><br/><p>Just as she was thinking this, someone pushed open the door roughly. </p><br/><p>Before she could complain out loud about the rude and uneducated person, Jun Xin\u2019s annoying voice appeared. \u201cHey, stinkin\u2019 woman, let\u2019s go downstairs and have breakfast together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no tables downstairs, are you inviting me to crouch with you at the doorway and eat?\u201d Tang Doudou sat in front of the dressing mirror. Qing Yu helped pull her hair into a small bun and secured it with a light blue jade hairpin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Doudou, please have a look. Do you like it like this?\u201d </p><br/><p>Jun Xin gave a \u2018tch\u2019 and said, \u201cNo matter how you do it the result would be the same: ugly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came here so early in the morning just to mock me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch. How could this young master have that much free time? I\u2019m here to tell you that Cloud City has already made an announcement asking the participants of the matchmaking competition to leave immediately. The time limit is three days. If they don\u2019t leave by then, they can only remain in Cloud City forever and might never be able to exit Cloud City again.\u201d Since Tang Doudou was going to take a long time to get ready, Jun Xin invited himself inside and sat down at the side of the table not too far away from her.</p><br/><p>Although she already knew that there would be such a day, but wasn\u2019t this way too soon?</p><br/><p>Moreover, they haven\u2019t found the people that instigated those assassins. How would they be able to continue investigating if they allowed the people involved to leave? </p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yi has returned?\u201d Something like making an announcement wasn\u2019t something that Murong Yu and the rest could decide on their own, because the announcement would only be valid after being stamped with Su Yi\u2019s seal. </p><br/><p>Jun Xin shrugged. \u201cHow would I know anything regarding the great City Lord Su\u2019s matters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, spit it out!\u201d He was always running around, so if he didn\u2019t know that then no one else would know.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d Jun Xin yawned, then revealed a mischievous smile. \u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about these irritating matters. I don\u2019t even know when we\u2019ll be able to meet again after I leave this time, so do me a favor and eat breakfast with me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was slightly depressed now. \u201cJust go eat by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to what Jun Xin had just said, she didn\u2019t have much of an appetite anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can only eat more when I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d Seeing that she had no intention to go, Jun Xin simply had Qing Yu move aside, casually picked up a few flower hairpins, inserted them into her hair, then dragged her towards the door.</p><br/><p>Da fudge! What kind of reasoning was that?</p><br/><p>Where could she find a second person as weird as him? She had to go even if she didn\u2019t feel like eating. When she thought to this point, she stood up and said with an utterly helpless tone, \u201cStop dragging, I can walk by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>This could be considered as Tang Doudou agreeing so Jun Xin turned around and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gave Qing Yu some instructions, then went downstairs with him.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t expect that the sun was already high in the sky outside; it looked as if it was almost noon. Jun Xin, this stinkin\u2019 brat, clearly came to find her to eat lunch, what breakfast ah! </p><br/><p>Seeing that the inn had resumed its business downstairs, she couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cAre you guys leaving too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t leave then could it be that we\u2019re supposed to stay here and accompany you forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d That was right. The announcement stated that those who didn\u2019t leave within three days would remain in Cloud City forever. </p><br/><p>\u201cHey, if you guys leave, won\u2019t I die from boredom?\u201d Tang Doudou sighed, seeming quite depressed. She also wanted to leave ah.</p><br/><p>There was nothing here at Cloud City that she was reluctant to part with, except perhaps a little in regards to Su Yi. Yet, Su Yi wanted to let her become some City Lord? Just the thought of it was laughable.</p><br/><p>But would Xiao Bai leave this time?</p><br/><p>There was no one in charge of the Alliance Head Residence yet. Could it be that she had to appoint someone else as the Alliance Head as well once she became City Lord?</p><br/><p>In fact, she was completely overthinking things. Su Yi had sent someone to pick her up once she finished eating. </p><br/><p>After she got back, Su Yi just said three sentences to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should just leave together with Baili Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe a good Alliance Head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing serious, then don\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou instantly went Sparta. Don\u2019t tell her that this trip to Cloud City was all in vain? Not a fart had changed and he was already chasing her out again?</p><br/><p>Hadn\u2019t they already agreed that she would inherit the position as the City Lord?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he promise that he would help her find a fianc\u00e9?</p><br/><p>And now he was kicking her back to act as a lousy martial arts Alliance Head? She felt unbearable distress. If she didn\u2019t have to inherit the City Lord\u2019s position anymore, then letting her play around leisurely for a while was also not bad ah!</p><br/><p>If she was the martial arts Alliance Head, she had to play cat and mouse again with that annoying Elder Yu. She couldn\u2019t tell if Su Yi wanted to train her or what. And that Elder Yu had been bouncing around for so long, yet Su Yi didn\u2019t lend a hand to deal with him.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for her to ask more, Su Yi hurriedly ran away again. It seemed that something had happened, so all of this was being postponed.</p><br/><p>When she returned to the inn, Baili Yu and the rest had already finished packing their belongings. By the look of things, they wouldn\u2019t need the three days to get ready and leave.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was sitting on top of the roof as always. She couldn\u2019t understand why he was so fond of rooftops. When Jun Xin saw Tang Doudou return, he revealed a shocked expression that was soon replaced by pleasant surprise as he jumped down. \u201cYou, did Su Yi let you come to send us off or let you leave together with us?\u201d </p><br/><p>After saying that, he looked nervously at Tang Doudou. </p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being like this?\u201d Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. She felt like Jun Xin was becoming weirder and weirder ah. </p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although I\u2019m the alliance head, it doesn\u2019t mean that I must control everything. An outsider like me has no right to ask about something related to your clans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Luoqing said with a laugh, \u201cAlliance Head sure likes to joke. What do you mean by outsider? Everything related to the martial arts community is the affair of the martial arts alliance and under your jurisdiction. When you put it this way, it\u2019s like you\u2019re excluding our clans from the martial arts community!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she said it jokingly, it was clear that the other people were taking it seriously. Xiao Qian\u2019s expression became even more stern. \u201cIs that what Alliance Head meant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stronghold Master Lin also looked over with a solemn expression. The master of the Murong family was the only one that remained aloof as if this had nothing to do with him.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he had also participated in the four clans\u2019 discussion, she would\u2019ve thought that he didn\u2019t actually belong to the four clans.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou laughed. \u201cHow is that possible? The entire martial arts community is a family. You guys are misunderstanding me. I\u2019m just saying that everyone is working to preserve the safety of the martial arts community, so there\u2019s no need to be hung up on the position of the alliance head. I\u2019m also simply just a member of the martial arts community and is on the same level as everyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Qian nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right, the martial arts community is a family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stronghold Master Lin also nodded with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s truly the martial arts community\u2019s fortune to have Alliance Head as their leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s no outsiders here, so family heads, you all are my seniors, there\u2019s no need to be so polite towards me. I\u2019m well aware of my own worth. Ever since I obtained this position, it had always been Bai gongzi that had been helping me deal with everything. I\u2019m truly ashamed that I really haven\u2019t done anything for the martial arts community.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words came from the heart. She really didn\u2019t want to hear those flattering words anymore. It was enough that the usual crowd said these things, but she felt like her life was shortening when she heard these seniors flatter her.</p><br/><p>When she said this, everyone\u2019s expressions changed in slightly different ways. In reality, they didn\u2019t want to be so polite towards Tang Doudou either. As she had said, they were seniors and she was of the younger generation. It should be her that addressed them with careful respect.</p><br/><p>Bai Luoqing laughed sweetly. \u201cAlliance Head, despite your young age, you\u2019re not arrogant or short-tempered. Just this is enough for us to feel great admiration. Back when I was your age, I had gone around plenty flinging around my status as the eldest miss of the Bai family. I often had my nose up in the air as I made a big fuss in front of those seniors and was quite haughty!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said this, the atmosphere became lively again.</p><br/><p>Stronghold Master Lin said with a smile, \u201cLittle Sister Bai is quite right. I was whipped by you plenty back then as well. Afterwards, I would avoid you whenever I saw you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this was brought up, the master of the Murong family who had been silent this entire time also said, \u201cWho didn\u2019t have that frivolous and rash phrase in their life? Back then, although us four weren\u2019t as friendly as the younger generation, we\u2019ve also gone through a fair share of life and death experiences together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Four?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. Xiao Qian was a generation older than these three!</p><br/><p>Just like how she was a generation younger than these three clan masters, there was no way they would hang out together. The fourth person was probably referring to Xiao Qian\u2019s son. It was just that, why was it that the Xiao family was the only one that hadn\u2019t passed the position of head of the family down yet?</p><br/><p>The words of the Murong family head not only made Tang Doudou think of the fourth person, the other three also recalled their old friend. Stronghold Master Lin\u2019s sigh was especially long and mournful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let them repeat that tragedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Luoqing glowered at Stronghold Master Lin. \u201cWhat are you bringing that up for all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stronghold Master Lin seemed to just realize what he said and glanced at Xiao Qian. His tone was apologetic as he said, \u201cUncle Xiao, I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t able to hold it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Family Head Murong also cupped his fist in salute towards Xiao Qian apologetically.</p><br/><p>Xiao Qian was expressionless but his eyes were stern. \u201cIt\u2019s already been so many years, this old man has long gotten used to it. Back then, Qi er had also bought things upon himself. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be so missed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three shared a look. In the end, it was Bai Luoqing that replied. \u201cAs long as Uncle Xiao doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Qian drove his horse forward. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s hurry to Barbarian Mound Garrison in order to deal with this current issue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Shuxuan and the others come back?\u201d After Xiao Qian left, Stronghold Master Lin started becoming worried and kept looking towards the sea of flowers. However, there were no figures in sight.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said, \u201cIf family heads trust me, then please lead everyone else to the garrison first. I\u2019m familiar with Azure Water Valley and had gone to Barbarian Mound Garrison several times as well, so leave it to me to find them. Once I find them, I\u2019ll bring them to Barbarian Mound Garrison to meet up with you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Luoqing glanced at the other two, then moved up to pat Tang Doudou\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat is Alliance Head saying? Of course we trust you. Then we\u2019ll have to trouble you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

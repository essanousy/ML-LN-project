However, if he said he didn\u2019t agree, that would be publicly opposing Shen Wuming. Either option was a bad choice. That person was stuck and couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Xiao Yi, Xiao Ren, and Tang Doudou were pressed against the door and peeking outside from the small crack above the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier that there was such a good spying spot?\u201d Tang Doudou had pushed her way to the very front and took up most of the space.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ren didn\u2019t speak so Xiao Yi answered, \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask ah! And we didn\u2019t know that you were planning to gather information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDumbass!\u201d Tang Doudou rapped his forehead. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t gather information first and just headed out, isn\u2019t that courting death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi asked, \u201cBut where exactly did that Shen Wuming come from? He seems really unbridled. Not even the people from the four large clans are saying anything against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wished that she knew!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. It seemed that she\u2019d only be able to find out about this matter once Baili Yu came back. She had a feeling that the reason Baili Yu had headed out this time also had something to do with this Shen Wuming.</p><br/><p>In addition, it wasn\u2019t that the four large clans didn\u2019t dare to do anything, it was clear that they didn\u2019t want to pay attention to this clown.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou believed in the ability of that elder from the Xiao family. There was no way he would humble himself in front of Shen Wuming.</p><br/><p>When she sank into thought, Xiao Ren and Xiao Yi exchanged a glance, then Xiao Yi asked, \u201cThen what do you plan to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see for now!\u201d Tang Doudou lifted her head to continue watching only to find that a fight had already broken out. After observing for a few moments, she exclaimed softly, \u201cShen Wuming actually killed someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren were stunned and squeezed over to look as well.</p><br/><p>It was complete chaos outside. Some were angry and wanted to teach Shen Wuming a lesson, others were stunned and wanted to escape\u2026 Screams, shouts, and crying filled the air, and Shen Wuming just stood in the midst of the chaos with a fearless and arrogant expression on his face. \u201cIf you have objections, this is your end. Who else has objections?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat old man seriously goes too far in bullying people!\u201d Even Xiao Ren couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He gritted his teeth angrily. \u201cA person\u2019s life is brought about by their parents. What right does others have to casually take another\u2019s life!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi\u2019s expression was stern as he looked at the corpse. \u201cThis guy surnamed Shen is actually here to purposefully cause trouble, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were Cang Baicao\u2019s followers so they had a deep respect for life. Shen Wuming\u2019s indiscriminate slaughter of the innocent infuriated them.</p><br/><p>The person that had died was the person who had been stuck on what to say earlier. He had been alive just a moment earlier, trying to come up with a way to answer Shen Wuming\u2019s purposeful questions, but in the blink of an eye, he was now lying in a puddle of his own blood and staring lifelessly towards the door.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pressed a hand against her chest. A burst of rage flooded her heart and rose to her head. She slammed her fist on the door, then prepared to open the door.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi hastily stopped her, then glanced towards Xiao Ren. \u201cLady Doudou, this Shen Wuming seems to be purposefully doing this to anger you so that you show up. He clearly knew that you were behind the door, that\u2019s why he did that just now. You can\u2019t fall into his trap!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Lady Doudou, Shen Wuming\u2019s definitely aiming for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way that Tang Doudou could still be unaware of that with things at this point, but she had to go out. She couldn\u2019t let people unrelated to her die because of her!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Look, the things are already gone, no matter how you grieve over it it\u2019s in vain? With this time, wouldn\u2019t it be better to go drink some tea and chat a little\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou looked at Qing Yin, not knowing how to start. Jun Xin\u2019s knife glares flew with \u2018swoosh\u2019s towards her body. Helpless, Tang Doudou could only chatter some nonsense to console Meng Yu.</p><br/><p>The moment Meng Yu heard that, she harshly glared at him, her voice raising several times louder, \u201cDrink tea and chat? Do you know that that deer meat is Master\u2019s main course for today? I busied from dawn until now, and now it\u2019s gone! What am I going to bring to Master!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll starve to death!\u201d And she was still wondering what it was, wasn\u2019t it just a meal?</p><br/><p>Meng Yu glared at her again: \u201cWhat do you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, she indeed didn\u2019t understand. But what she precisely wanted was for Baili Yu to have no lunch to eat, otherwise how can she gift these spicy strips?</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin, your Master is coming over today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally she wasn\u2019t planning to tell Tang Doudou, but the conversation had already gotten to this point so she couldn\u2019t conceal it anymore either. So she replied: \u201cMaster is coming over today, but he didn\u2019t say when he\u2019ll arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come before noon.\u201d At the side, Jun Xin was incessantly resentful. He didn\u2019t get to eat the deer meat, but on the contrary caused his entire body to smell.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then, thinking again, those spicy strips also weren\u2019t that bad. After eating them he can\u2019t help but recall and yearn for them again and again. How about he just takes the blame for this guy and coerce him to make more spicy strips so he can eat to his heart\u2019s content?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was just thinking about how to persuade Qing Yin to bring her to Baili Yu when from the corners of her eyes she saw Jun Xin staring at her with a deliberating look. This butt-aged little brat, he couldn\u2019t be thinking of a way to get revenge on her, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming before noon?\u201d Meng Yu originally had stopped crying, but hearing this, she started wailing with a \u2018wah\u2019 again, \u201cAiyoh aah! Isn\u2019t this pretty much asking for my life!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Yu jiejie, don\u2019t cry anymore. What Li gongzi said is right, rather than grieving here like this, why don\u2019t we all try to think of some way to remedy this.\u201d Qing Yin helped Meng Yu up and spoke softly to comfort her. Her speaking voice was like a cool breeze carrying fine rain, it gently brushed past the present people\u2019s hearts; it was extremely comfortable.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s seriously a wonderful and clever person. Baili Yu sure has great fortune, to have a maid like this, his days must be peaceful, ne?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at Qing Yin appreciatively when a magnified face suddenly filled her line of sight. It had two giant panda eyes which fiercely glared at her.</p><br/><p>Ah! What the freak!? Scared poor baby* to death!</p><br/><p> \u2013 \u201dbaby\u201d the word is actually baobao which is a term that means baby, but made of the individual characters for treasure. It\u2019s a very cute way to say baby and the phrase \u201cscared baobao to death\u201d is now commonly used online and in a lot of Chinese novels. I\u2019ll use poor baby though b/c baobao doesn\u2019t look that cute in pinyin to me</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Qing Yin isn\u2019t someone you can casually have designs on!\u201d Suddenly swiftly moving over, Jun Xin spoke in a small voice, his eyes filled with red fruit*(bare naked) warning.</p><br/><p>Rumor goes a forum censored the word \u201c\u201d from \u201c\u201c which means completely naked, so people started using \u201c\u201d which ends up meaning red fruit to refer to it instead.</p><br/><p>Yo! This stinking brat thought she\u2019s taking a fancy to Qing Yin?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She indeed did take a fancy to her. Such a pity ah, regretfully the heavens didn\u2019t give her a male body, and she also doesn\u2019t intend to go towards lilies(yuri/lesbian)!</p><br/><p>Pushing aside Jun Xin with one heave, \u201cLittle BB! Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be fine just by pushing the blame onto me after eating the deer meat. You should help Lady Meng Yu think of an idea right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still give a damn about your face!? That deer meat was clearly secretly eaten by you!\u201d Jun Xin\u2019s swollen face was completely red. Seeing Meng Yu aggrievedly look over, he immediately defended himself.</p><br/><p>He had always been direct and straightforward, and never covered up things, much less do something and refuse to admit it. Regarding this point, he truly looked down on Tang Doudou!</p><br/><p>All that admitting it would bring about is a beating. Not even having this amount of guts, he\u2019s seriously not fit to be called a man!</p><br/><p>But what was even more infuriating was that he was actually fancying Qing Yin. Look at that eyeballs-almost-popping-out mesmerized lecherous look, where the hell exactly did this guy crawl out from?</p><br/><p>How was it possible for Tang Doudou not to see the disdain in his eyes? What a pity though, she, Doudou wasn\u2019t some manly man of upright character from the start. Little ladies must be flexible, able to bow and submit and stand tall as the situation requires. Meng Yu\u2019s body size is that huge, if she really admitted it was her that secretly ate the food, how many punches could her little body even bear?</p><br/><p>Even though Jun Xin\u2019s body was also not that much bigger than hers, but the other is superior in the fact that he\u2019s experienced long-term beatings, that skin has even thickened! It can hold up to a beating!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Not to mention, he\u2019s already eaten her spicy strips for free. As the saying goes, taking things of others, hand will be short; eating things of others, mouth will be soft*. Jun Xin is still small and can\u2019t understand this logic yet. As an adult, she, Tang Doudou will be magnanimous and not nitpick about that much!</p><br/><p>When you take something from someone, when the person asks you to help them do something you\u2019d feel uncomfortable refusing. After eating other people\u2019s things, you\u2019ll feel uncomfortable criticizing them after.</p><br/><p>If Jun Xin found out that she was thinking such shameless thoughts, he would be immediately infuriated to the point he puked blood, never wanting to have dealings with this sort of person again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he ah? Why would he be here?\u201d Meng Yu watched Jun Xin and Tang Doudou make eyes at each other and suddenly recalled a very important matter, who the hell is this ah?!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was just about to reply when Qing Yin at the side rushed to speak first: \u201cMeng Yu jiejie, this is Li gongzi. The guest Master invited over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi? Which Li gongzi? Why haven\u2019t I ever heard of him before? And when has Master ever invited someone over, it\u2019s seriously a rare and strange occasion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Yu most likely has also thought it through and absent-mindedly was muttering when her eyes spied Jun Xin who was just about to slip away. With large steps she crossed over and her stout palm slapped Jun Xin\u2019s head. Grabbing the front of Jun Xin\u2019s garment, she dragged him back into the courtyard, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Great Young Master Jun. Hurry and start thinking of ideas for me! You bunch of bastards, all you\u2019re good at is being full of damned tricks! If you\u2019re going to sneak food then just sneak food, why\u2019d you have to make the kitchen that messy!? You must have been planning to make it look like a thief broke in! Unfortunately for you this lady\u2019s eyes are discerning and immediately saw through it! Confess now, where did my five catty of wheat flour go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>How could Jun Xin possibly be willing to go with her? He hurriedly pulled over the Tang Doudou that was next to him and hastily said, \u201cNot me, he\u2019s the one full of damned tricks. Meng Yu you better ask him! And, your wheat flour\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish speaking, Tang Doudou suddenly started laughing with a loud \u2018hahaha\u2019, cutting of his words.</p><br/><p>Causing all three to be exceptionally puzzled, what\u2019s with him? What\u2019s he laughing about?</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026 Actually, solving this matter is very simple!\u201d Tang Doudou seized the opportunity to grab Jun Xin\u2019s shoulder and whisper at him: \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to say that I was the one that used the wheat flour. As long as you take the blame of this for me, I\u2019ll help you get Meng Yu to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t trust you!\u201d Jun Xin was very straightforward.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was ladened with grief. It couldn\u2019t be that she looked that untrustworthy, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether you trust or not isn\u2019t important. The important point is that right now there\u2019s only me that can help you! Otherwise it couldn\u2019t be that you still want to get beaten?\u201d Tang Doudou raised an eyebrow. Not waiting for Jun Xin to agree, she moved close to Meng Yu\u2019s ear and mumbled a few sentences.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>All that could be seen was Meng Yu instantly exposed a happy expression. Looking at Tang Doudou, she asked: \u201cIs that for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI swear there\u2019s not half a word of falsehood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen ok, I\u2019ll just believe you this once!\u201d After Meng Yu finished speaking, she suddenly headed towards her original path to return. Before she left she shot Jun Xin a warning glare: \u201cLittle brat Jun, if you dare try to steal food again, don\u2019t blame me for not being polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was amazed, watching dazedly as Meng Yu disappeared ahead. Finally snapping back to his senses, he asked: \u201cWhat did you say to her? For her to let it go this easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, secret!\u201d Tang Doudou curved her eyes, ignoring him. She weighed the food box in her hand a couple times, \u201cI\u2019ve helped you deal with Meng Yu, now it\u2019s your turn to help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never agreed to help you!\u201d Who knew once Jun Xin heard that, he humphed, completely ungrateful.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t mind it. Walking forward and hooking her arm around his shoulder, she said: \u201cWould you believe, that as long as I give a squeak, Meng Yu will immediately appear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you squeak for this young master to hear?!\u201d Once Meng Yu was gone, Jun Xin immediately reverted back to his tsunderely arrogant attitude. Only when he casted a sidelong glance at Tang Doudou did he release how much taller he was than Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou also realized it and promptly pulled away, increasing the distance. Meeting him in the eye, her tone with frivolous, \u201cActing like this, you\u2019re forcing me ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jun, Li gongzi, stop playing.\u201d Seeing the gunpowder between the two start to ignite, Qing Yin felt a headache coming on. Back then why did she actively volunteer to take this task, it was a miscalculation, a huge blunder!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin ah! That\u2019s not right! Jun Xin and I aren\u2019t playing around, aren\u2019t we helping Meng Yu deal with your family\u2019s Master?\u201d Hearing Qing Yin\u2019s words, Tang Doudou became upset and sincerely attempted to enlighten her.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin also counts as having become experienced with Tang Doudou\u2019s way with spouting out nonsense without thinking. What\u2019s more, these two were not ordinary people, it also wasn\u2019t her place as a servant to control them. Meng Yu is only able to cause a fuss and shout Jun Xin\u2019s name because her cooking skill was superb and Master would only eat food that she makes, so her status, in the end, was completely different from the rest of them.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t gongzi want to go look for master? Looking at the time, it\u2019s almost about noon.\u201d Meaning was, stop chirping and chattering with Jun Xin, let\u2019s hurry up and go.</p><br/><p>If it was the earlier Tang Doudou, she definitely would have immediately left without objections. But right now ah, she had other plans!</p><br/><p>Otherwise she also wouldn\u2019t stay here, wasting half the day\u2019s effort.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Giving Qing Yin a reassuring smile, she started chatting idly with Jun Xin. She didn\u2019t exhibit the slightest intention of leaving, on the contrary, it seemed like she was waiting for someone.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin could only stand at the side and wait on her.</p><br/><p>After a while, Jun Xin also realized that something was not right. Pushing aside Tang Doudou who was suspiciously groping him as if eating his tofu(mild sexual harassment), he asked: \u201cYou\u2019re waiting for someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you got smart ah! I am waiting for someone.\u201d Tang Doudou curved her eyes. Although Jun Xin was a little tsundere, but after interacting with him for a while she knew his thoughts were simple. They came directly and left directly; he\u2019s a person worth becoming friends with.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just his temper was a little unpredictable.</p><br/><p>But thinking of this little young man, he was just in the midst of adolescence. The ancient era wasn\u2019t like the modern era where there were not that many restrictions between men and women. His hormones were raging yet he couldn\u2019t find any release, to have a slightly strange temper was quite normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaiting for Baili Yu?\u201d Just then he had heard Qing Yin say his surname was Li. With things this obvious, if he still couldn\u2019t guess who this person in front of him was, his brain would have been a waste of space.</p><br/><p>But, he really did not expect that the terrible Li Xueyi from the rumors was actually, aside from being a bit unusually scheming, quite pleasing to the eye. Anyways, he hadn\u2019t seen someone this pleasing to the eye for a long time, so he decided to be patient and stay with him a bit longer.</p><br/><p>Actually, he just wanted spicy strips. It was just that the words came to his mouth several times but were swallowed down again, as he completely had no idea how he should start asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, why would I wait for him? Not to mention if I was going to wait for him I wouldn\u2019t wait here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who are you waiting for?\u201d He\u2019s not waiting for Baili Yu, but wasn\u2019t he planning to find Baili Yu earlier? Looking at that food box, he recalled those extremely spicy spicy strips that she had packed in there earlier and swallowed his saliva, \u201cYou made all those for Baili Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t try to hide it from him and confidently admitted to it, \u201cHe said that as long as he became happy, he\u2019ll help me cure the poison. Helpless, I thought for half the day but still didn\u2019t know how I could make him happy, so I made him some food. Don\u2019t they say after eating other\u2019s things the mouth gets soft? Perhaps after he eats it he\u2019ll feel uncomfortable not returning the favor and help me conveniently get rid of the poison. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>He actually felt Baili Yu would be that type of person whose mouth gets soft after eating other people\u2019s things? Jun Xin just wanted to laugh. Earlier he even complimented him on his cleverness, yet right now his IQ was taking a sharp dive. If Baili Yu was really that sort of person, the entire world would be completely beautiful!</p><br/><p>Sending another glance at Tang Doudou\u2019s healthy facial color, he couldn\u2019t help but ask curiously: \u201cWhat are you poisoned with? Isn\u2019t there still a Godly Doctor Cang Baicao in Cloud City? Why didn\u2019t you go to look for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by LazyMiyu, Proofread by Ocelot</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>Chiyomira has nothing random to say this time.

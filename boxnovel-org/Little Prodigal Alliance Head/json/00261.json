We\u2019ve barely walked anywhere, yet you\u2019re saying that you can\u2019t walk anymore? You\u2019re purposefully teasing this lady, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Tang Doudou was a little annoyed with his antics and turned around to yell at him.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly but he didn\u2019t get angry. \u201cLady Doudou, although this one is a Saint Envoy, this one doesn\u2019t know martial arts and would often fall ill. That\u2019s why this one\u2019s physical strength isn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t believe him. What kind of Saint Envoy was he if he didn\u2019t know martial arts? How could the Seven Great Saint Tribes possibly allow him to be a Saint Envoy if he didn\u2019t know martial arts?</p><br/><p>Perhaps Lan Jia noticed that she was skeptical because he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can just take a look yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>How was she supposed to \u2018take a look\u2019? It\u2019s not like she had all-seeing eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaint Envoy Lan Jia, if we don\u2019t walk a little faster, the people behind us will nag again!\u201d Although she had increased her speed during this time and left the crowd behind them quite a ways off, with how slow Lan Jia was going, the crowd would catch up to them again soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cUsually Ah Yu would carry me over\u2026\u201d Lan Jia sighed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we rest for a while before continuing?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he really sat down on the iron chains and even dangled his legs carefreely.</p><br/><p>The hair tie wasn\u2019t very long. After Lan Jia sat down, Tang Doudou had to crouch as well.</p><br/><p>When she crouched down, the bugs in the seams of the iron chains became even more visible. She hastily said, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried that these bugs would bite your butt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t like to eat meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven rabbits would bite people once they\u2019re cornered. You\u2019re sitting on them right now and probably causing them a lot of pain. Are you sure they wouldn\u2019t bite you?\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s greatest worry was that these bugs would bite her. Although she no longer had the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance in her body, her poison blood was still present!</p><br/><p>Lan Jia waved his hand. \u201cYou should sit down as well. Don\u2019t worry, even if they like to bite, they wouldn\u2019t bite the butt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, his gaze actually swept towards Tang Doudou\u2019s butt and he said disdainfully, \u201cMoreover, there\u2019s no way they\u2019d be interested in such a skinny one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s face turned completely black in speechlessness.</p><br/><p>Because she discovered that Lan Jia\u2019s butt was actually perkier than hers\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was depressed. Why did she end up encounter Lan Jia, this weirdo, at this sort of time? She didn\u2019t even know how far ahead Mu Ye had gotten. She probably hadn\u2019t even gotten half way.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet on!\u201d Tang Doudou saw that the black-clothed people behind them were almost caught up and kicked Lan Jia\u2019s butt before standing up.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia looked up, confused. \u201cLady Doudou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll piggyback you!\u201d Tang Doudou glowered at him. \u201cHurry up!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lan Jia heard that Tang Doudou was going to carry him, he immediately smiled and replied \u2018alright\u2019 happily. Without bothering to be polite at all, he got onto Tang Doudou\u2019s back and forced Lil\u2019 Gray who was originally on her back to move to her front.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, Lady Doudou\u2019s chest has become bigger!\u201d Tang Doudou sensed that his gaze swept over her chest. Following that, he remarked this in a surprised tone.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt an internal injury. \u201cShut up, otherwise I\u2019ll throw you off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia finally shut his mouth. Tang Doudou sighed in relief, then started revolving her inner strength and walking forward.</p><br/><p>Originally, she thought that it would be very tiring to carry Lan Jia, but unexpectedly he was very light. It was to the point that she suspected this guy of being a girl. However, she recalled that there was an Adam\u2019s apple on his throat and immediately dispersed this thought to focus on continuing forward.</p><br/><p>When she got to the other end of the iron chain, she saw that Mu Ye was standing with Ah Yu who was sitting.</p><br/><p>Right after they got off the iron chain, Tang Doudou threw Lan Jia onto the ground and ran towards Mu Ye. \u201cMy god ah! I\u2019m exhausted!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye glanced at her, then glanced at Lan Jia. It was clear he was confused as to why Tang Doudou had ended up carrying Lan Jia over.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you encounter danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shook her head. However, she felt that she would prefer encountering danger over being with Lan Jia. That guy was seriously too annoying!</p><br/><p>She thought that he had finally calmed down, but after carrying him awhile, he started chattering again nonstop like he was reciting a chant. Most of it was about Baili Yu being nothing special and that she should just marry him instead.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had shot back a few sentences.</p><br/><p>Did you have as much money as him?</p><br/><p>Were you as good-looking as him?</p><br/><p>Were your martial arts as good as his?</p><br/><p>Lan Jia immediately fell silent. In the end, he remarked quietly, \u201cSo it turns out that you\u2019re this shallow of a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyone would be able to tell that she was just saying this due to anger, alright?</p><br/><p>The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. She didn\u2019t bother to answer Mu Ye and tried to pull him and leave.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Ah Yu blocked her way. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to leave! Saint Envoy Lan Jia helped you, yet you repaid grace with cruelty and threw Saint Envoy down. Now you want to just run off? Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little too excessive!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her forehead. \u201cHe helped me? Yes, he did help me, but I also carried him over! It\u2019s canceled out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah Yu laughed coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s your fortune to have the opportunity to carry him. In any case, you\u2019re not allowed to leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although they had been able to hear the disturbance from inside, actually seeing such a crowd was an entirely different matter.</p><br/><p>This was the only inhabited area in Azure Water Valley. Originally, the path here went through a very narrow bamboo forest, but that forest could no longer be seen. Instead, the area was filled with human figures dressed in various colors that were a bit glaring to look at under the scorching sunlight.</p><br/><p>That was right, she had been blinded by these people.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren had peeked at the situation outside through the crack in the door earlier, but they hadn\u2019t seen the situation this clearly. After glancing outside, the two quickly pushed Tang Doudou, then slammed the door shut without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Slam!</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been loud, but everyone present heard it. No one had noticed when the door opened, but when the door closed, the sound attracted their attention and they all looked over at Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>An old lady?</p><br/><p>Everyone was taken aback when they got a clear look at the person. Why was it an old lady? However, when they took a closer look, she really did seem to be an old lady! They had traveled all the way here from Huai City and waited here under the scorching sun for an entire afternoon only to see an old lady?</p><br/><p>Some people\u2019s expressions turned unfriendly as they scrutinized Tang Doudou. There were quite a few that were suspicious.</p><br/><p>With so many scorching gazes trying to examine her, she naturally used her strongest skill of being shameless and ignored all these looks. Without any expression on her face, she started feeling her way forward while keeping her eyes fixed in one direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s blind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould she be acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s likely!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of discussions soon appeared after a moment of silence.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t mind. It would be strange if they didn\u2019t suspect her. She would only be able to shed these suspicions after they suspected her and reality proved their suspicions wrong. After that, she\u2019d be able to listen and find the information she needed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrannie?\u201d After watching her walk for a while, someone finally couldn\u2019t stand just watching anymore. A sweet beautiful female voice appeared in front of her. Tang Doudou could see that that it was a quite beautiful woman. She used the standard way to check if someone was blind on Tang Doudou, which was, waving her hand in front of Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou, of course, ignored her and continued walking without reacting to that woman at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like she\u2019s not only blind, she\u2019s also deaf!\u201d Someone shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAzure Water Valley is a medical valley. It\u2019s normal for them to take in crippled old people. Alright, stop watching her and let\u2019s just continue the discussion!\u201d suggested someone.</p><br/><p>However, another person quickly refuted, \u201cNo way. Who knows if she isn\u2019t Li-, Alliance Head Li in disguise? Everyone knows that Alliance Head Li is very strange in her ways and often does unpredictable things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we should probably ask Bai gongzi,\u201d said someone in a meaningful way.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi, see that blind and deaf grandma over there. Is she Alliance Head Li?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aiyah, Bai Feiyun was here too?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou originally wanted to glance around and see where Bai Feiyun was, but then it occurred to her that there would definitely be a lot of martial arts experts here. The slightest change in her behavior would be detected, so she really needed to stay unperturbed.</p><br/><p>However, Bai Feiyun was a frequent visitor of Azure Water Valley. Normally, he didn\u2019t even need to give a greeting to enter but he had chosen to wait with these people outside. Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren didn\u2019t know much about the affairs of the martial arts community and definitely wouldn\u2019t bar him from entering, so Bai Feiyun\u2019s current actions were seriously strange!</p><br/><p>In addition, Cang Baicao and Bai Feiyun pretty much had a master and disciple relationship, so what exactly was Bai Feiyun trying to do?</p><br/><p>When she recalled Bai Feiyun, she couldn\u2019t help but remember how he poisoned Jun Xin in Cloud City. At that time, she hadn\u2019t believed it. After all, Bai Feiyun seemed to be the type of person that would find using poison contemptible and there was no way that Cang Baicao would pass on his knowledge to Bai Feiyun if Bai Feiyun\u2019s moral quality was lacking.</p><br/><p>And even if Cang Baicao\u2019s eyes had gone bad from age, what about Su Yi\u2019s?</p><br/><p>He had lived for so long so he probably had more experience than anyone else alive. No matter how good Bai Feiyun was at scheming, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to also trick Su Yi as well, right?</p><br/><p>Could it be that this Bai Feiyun was fake?</p><br/><p>This thought shocked Tang Doudou to the point that her back was covered with cold sweat and she couldn\u2019t help but shudder.</p><br/><p>Immediately, she heard the slight sound of inner strength being released, so she hastily calmed her thoughts down and sneezed, then hammer her chest while coughing.</p><br/><p>Those waves of energy gradually receded, but it didn\u2019t disappear entirely.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dare to think about it anymore and just focused on walking forward until she reached the edge of the forest. She remembered that there was a stone block here and that next to it was a broom for sweeping the leaves.</p><br/><p>However, right now, not only was the block gone, the broom was also gone.</p><br/><p>Instead, there was a row of young people dressed in bright yellow attire hugging longswords while watching her curiously.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t care and just walked straight over.</p><br/><p>Those people naturally wouldn\u2019t stand there for her to run into them. They moved aside and revealed that stone block.</p><br/><p>All the moss on the block had been trampled flat. Tang Doudou reached out to start feeling for something.</p><br/><p>Some people were confused. What was she doing?</p><br/><p>However, someone soon answered for her. \u201cI remember now, it\u2019s a broom! There was a broom here earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the broom?\u201d A dark yellow attire suddenly appeared in the midst of the people dressed in bright yellow. A stern-looking old man berated the people behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201d A young man picked up the broom from the ground.</p><br/><p>The old man glanced at that broom. \u201cBring it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Leader, we can do it!\u201d The people of the sect were well aware that their sect leader was currently angry, so he was trying to act more enthusiastic, but the sect leader just glared at him. Hence, he stopped talking and just obediently handed it over.</p><br/><p>The bright yellow garments were very distinctive, so Tang Doudou remembered it clearly. They seemed to be called the Gold Sword Faction and their sect leader was Jin Fengyi.</p><br/><p>She had never seen him before though, so she wasn\u2019t sure if he was Jin Fengyi.</p><br/><p>He walked over with the broom, his steps firm as rocks and his voice as deep as water. \u201cGrannie, your broom.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

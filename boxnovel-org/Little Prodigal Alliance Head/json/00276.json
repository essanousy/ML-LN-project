Otherwise I\u2019d think that you were serious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He pulled her down till she ended up kneeling and repeated, \u201cThis is your father!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine fine, he\u2019s my father.\u201d Mu Ye seemed so serious that it was a little scary, so Tang Doudou went along with what he said.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, right after she said that, Mu Ye said, \u201cKowtow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou refused. It was enough that he had her kneel down, but now she even had to kowtow? Was he really going to make her acknowledge that this pile of bones was her father?</p><br/><p>But when she saw his cold eyes, she didn\u2019t dare to question his words outrightly. After all, he was the Leader of the Demonic Sect and was also a very strict and meticulous person. If she provoked him, he might chop her head off.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough. Ahem, Mu Ye, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to kowtow, but shouldn\u2019t you give me a reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye glanced downwards at her and repeated, \u201cHe\u2019s your father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou swayed from dizziness. Couldn\u2019t he switch to a different reason?</p><br/><p>However, she had no choice but to obediently kowtow to these bones. She told herself inwardly to just treat it as making up for accidently stepping on the bones earlier.</p><br/><p>After she finished, she peeked at Mu Ye from the corner of her eye. His expression seemed to relax slightly, he then abruptly knelt down as well.</p><br/><p>That movement startled Tang Doudou. Could it be that these bones were also Mu Ye\u2019s father?</p><br/><p>It was clear that she had been thinking along the wrong lines again. Although Mu Ye also kowtowed, what he said was, \u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll look after her. So Senior, rest in peace!\u201d</p><br/><p>His words shocked Tang Doudou. Rest in peace? Could it be that this guy\u2019s ghost was still here?</p><br/><p>She looked towards Mu Ye in shock only to find that he was looking at her as well. As they gazed into each other\u2019s eyes, Tang Doudou suddenly noticed that there were emotions in his usually cold and expressionless eyes. Her heart suddenly tightened. The way they were kneeling could easily be misinterpreted.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye said the bones in front of her were her father\u2019s, so the way they were kneeling in front of this old guy was almost like they were kneeling as part of a marriage ritual. In addition, the light of the torch was starting to sway slightly, so the atmosphere became very strange.</p><br/><p>Not long later, that familiar rattling noise started again. She lifted her head and looked in the direction they had come from as she asked, \u201cCould Shen Moru have let that thing out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye closed his eyes. When he opened them again, he glanced over at the darkness. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone actually did let that thing out!?\u201d Tang Doudou was shocked.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye stood up. \u201cThis path leads to a dead end.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou saw Mu Ye get up, she hastily got up as well. She used the torch to light up the darkness ahead of them and found that there was a thick mud wall ahead. There was no passage visible.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you encounter Shen Moru when you went out earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe ran off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t we going back the way we came?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be dangerous.\u201d After Mu Ye finished speaking, he felt that he hadn\u2019t made his stand clear enough so he continued, \u201cLet\u2019s wait here for a while. We\u2019ll head out once that sound disappears.\u201d</p><br/><p>That distant rattling sound seemed to be getting closer, so what objections could Tang Doudou voice?</p><br/><p>She lowered her head and replied, \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she searched for a clean place to sit down and stuck the torch into the soil next to her.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye seemed to have glanced at her, but by the time she looked up, he had already shifted his gaze away.</p><br/><p>Weird!</p><br/><p>What was with Mu Ye?</p><br/><p>What exactly did he see below that pile of bones?</p><br/><p>As she wondered about this, Mu Ye started moving again. He bent down and gathered up those bones before pulling off his upper garment and using it to carry them.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye only had two layers on. He had given her his outer garment to use as a coat, so now that he took off his black upper garment, his toned muscle and back, along with his perfect waistline was revealed. His skin wasn\u2019t the color of white jade, but a wild wheat color. This sight was extremely alluring.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou only took one glance before hastily turning away. Of course, she didn\u2019t turn away out of bashfulness. It was because if she keep looking, she definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back that lusty impulse to rush forward and cop a good feel\u2026</p><br/><p>After Mu Ye finished gathering up those bones, he turned around. He only realized that his current state was a little inappropriate when he saw that Tang Doudou was looking away with a strange expression on her face. He immediately lifted his hand and used the bundle to hide his chest.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t look directly, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself from peeking. When she saw that Mu Ye was covering his chest, she was floored. Mu Ye was actually making such a girl-like gesture! Jesus! This completely overturned her perception of the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must bring Senior back to where he belongs\u2026\u201d said Mu Ye. His voice was a little strange and it appeared as though he was trying to explain why he took off his clothes. However, after starting, he felt like there really was no need to explain so he stopped midway.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes and patted her chest to calm down her chaotic heart before replying in an incomparably unperturbed tone, \u201cEn, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other reason,\u201d said Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou inhaled deeply. \u201cAhem, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after she said that, she heard a ripping noise come from behind her. It seemed to Mu Ye was ripping some fabric, but he had used his upper shirt to carry the bones, so what was he ripping now?</p><br/><p>Pants?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s thoughts started drifting off in a murky direction. The image of Mu Ye with his upper half naked and half his thighs exposed appeared in her mind\u2026</p><br/><p>Slap!</p><br/><p>She had to slap herself. Fudge! Baili Yu hadn\u2019t even died yet she was almost about to give him a huge Hulunbuir prairie hat!</p><br/><p>Although Baili Yu was a despicable bastard and had probably given her a little green hat, she had her principles. Before she officially said \u2018bye bye\u2019 to Baili Yu, she shouldn\u2019t think of anything else.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she still couldn\u2019t forget him right now. She sighed and started rolling the thumb ring between her palms. Her heart also slowly calmed down from the stimulation of seeking Mu Ye\u2019s naked back. When she returned, she should return this ring to Baili Yu, and then look for Su Yi to cancel the engagement\u2026</p><br/><p>After feeling sad for a little while, Tang Doudou turned back around. After all, there was no way she could keep her neck twisted the entire time, her muscles would cramp!</p><br/><p>However, she regretted her decision the moment she turned around.</p><br/><p>If the Heavens would give her another chance, she definitely wouldn\u2019t turn around even if her neck started convulsing from cramps.</p><br/><p>Never had she imagined that Mu Ye had ripped off strips of cloth so that he could use them to cover those seductive little beanbeans\u2026</p><br/><p>The most fatal part of this move was the fact that he didn\u2019t seem to know that revealing only a hint of alluring parts was the most basic technique of seduction! Heavens ah, this even had a touch of bondage!</p><br/><p>The dusky light cast by the flames created a hazy feeling. Tang Doudou could feel the fire spreading from her heart to the point she felt lightheaded. Her eyes rolled back and with a thud, she fell to the ground unconscious.</p><br/><p>The moment before her consciousness faded, she was screaming in her heart that this was too unfair! Was she actually that much of a beast!?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

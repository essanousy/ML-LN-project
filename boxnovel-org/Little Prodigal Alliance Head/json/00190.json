He asked Bai Feiyun, \u201cFeiyun, um, how is Xueyi right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Cang had me find City Lord to ask for Hemostatic Fruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHemostatic Fruit?\u201d Su Yi was completely confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s Hemostatic Fruit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Bai Feiyun was also stunned. If he didn\u2019t even know what Hemostatic Fruit was, would he have any?</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao was the only one that knew the answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy, don\u2019t worry about it. Was it Old Cang that said I had Hemostatic Fruits? Then come with me to the treasury to look for the Hemostatic Fruit. If you see anything else that might be useful, just take them all.\u201d Su Yi didn\u2019t remember whether he had this Hemostatic Fruit in his treasury or not, but he could tell from Bai Feiyun\u2019s expression that this was something they urgently needed so he immediately pulled Bai Feiyun towards the City Lord Residence.</p><br/><p>They made a round in his treasury. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the situation was urgent, Bai Feiyun definitely would have stayed in here for several days. There were seriously too many rare things in here. A lot were treasures that had vanished from the outside world years ago.</p><br/><p>There were Hemostatic Fruits in here, and there were even a lot of them. Those red fruits had been casually thrown in a pile to the side. One could tell from this treatment how little their owner valued them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is Hemostatic Fruit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I\u2019ll go bring the things back first. City Lord should go arrange for someone to boil water! Then bring the water to the room in a cask.\u201d Bai Feiyun immediately rushed to leave once he got the Hemostatic Fruits.</p><br/><p>However, right after he turned around, he suddenly paused and looked back at Su Yi as if he wanted to say something but was hesitating. \u201cCity Lord\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it straight out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should go and look for a maid in the city. Senior Cang and I are both men\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi understood. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go do that right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two split up to work. After Bai Feiyun brought the Hemostatic Fruits and the drug ingredients over, he started helping Cang Baicao in the highly difficult rescue operation. As for Su Yi, he walked around the treasury again and sent all the items and medicinal ingredients that looked useful to Cang Baicao\u2019s courtyard before heading to the streets to try and recruit a servant girl.</p><br/><p>The moment he walked out, a large blue-green bird flew over from the horizon. \u201cChirp chirp\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu\u2019s here?\u201d The information the large bird brought gave Su Yi a huge fright. \u201cHow is he so fast? Where is he now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2019s entered the city?\u201d It seemed he had underestimated how much Baili Yu valued his disciple ah!</p><br/><p>However, Baili Yu\u2019s early arrival was messing up his plan. Moreover, if Baili Yu found out about Tang Doudou\u2019s current condition, that stinkin\u2019 brat would definitely try to kill him!</p><br/><p>This won\u2019t do! He couldn\u2019t let him find out about Tang Doudou\u2019s current situation!</p><br/><p>Currently, only four people knew about this situation. Of course, the person that injured Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t included.</p><br/><p>When Su Yi\u2019s thoughts got to that person, his anger burst out all at once and he didn\u2019t have the patience to try to find a servant girl anymore. He revealed his identity as the City Lord and used some sex appeal to drag two servant girls back before rushing off to investigate who exactly had injured Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>By the time he finished everything and returned to Cang Baicao\u2019s place, it was already late, yet the people inside still haven\u2019t come out yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is the situation inside? You two haven\u2019t been able to go in?\u201d The two young girls that had been dragged here by him were standing outside the door. When they saw him, they hastily moved up to meet him with expressions of having suffered grievances. However, Su Yi was currently more worried than he was curious right now.</p><br/><p>The girl wearing a yellow garment nodded with unspoken grievances. \u201cThat gongzi in white said that it wasn\u2019t time for us to enter yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just wait outside for now.\u201d The fact that they weren\u2019t letting people in definitely meant that they hadn\u2019t finished treating her. However, Cang Baicao should have at least come out to tell him a bit about the situation.</p><br/><p>Su Yi was beside himself with worry, but he didn\u2019t dare to rashly disturb the people inside. He could only wait with the two servant girls outside the door.</p><br/><p>The current situation inside the room was not optimistic at all.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun frequently reached out to help wipe the sweat from Cang Baicao\u2019s forehead and didn\u2019t dare to be distracted even for a moment as he passed everything Cang Baicao needed immediately to his hand.</p><br/><p>Speaking shouldn\u2019t be mentioned, right now he didn\u2019t even dare to breathe too loudly.</p><br/><p>What he was currently most concerned about was Cang Baicao\u2019s physical state. No matter how good his medical expertise was, he was old and his endurance wasn\u2019t as good as that of someone as young as he. He had seen Cang Baicao\u2019s hand shake several times. If it weren\u2019t for his countless years of expertise, he probably would have already made a mistake by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAcupuncture needle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Retrieving his thoughts, Bai Feiyun picked up the sterilized needle next to him and passed it over. However, before he could pass it to Cang Baicao\u2019s hand, Cang Baicao\u2019s body swayed and he almost fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Cang.\u201d Bai Feiyun hastily moved to support Cang Baicao up, then took a piece of ginseng and placed it into his mouth. Following that, he turned to look at the wound that had temporarily stopped bleeding and said in a low voice, \u201cLet me do it instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao looked at him with shock but started considering the idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already at your limit. If you keep pushing on\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t finish his words but the meaning was clear. Cang Baicao naturally knew what he meant. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Once a person got old, even if they refused to give in to it, they still couldn\u2019t do anything about it!</p><br/><p>However, would Bai Feiyun be able to do it?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Cang, don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s no way I would fool around with her life.\u201d Bai Feiyun glanced towards the unconscious person on the bed. His hands tightened into fists within his sleeves. I definitely won\u2019t let anything happen to you.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then he exclaimed with surprise, \u201cWhy would it be this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is\u2026\u201d Before Tang Doudou could even finish speaking, a silt whirlpool appeared below her feet. She didn\u2019t even have the chance to scream before she fell.</p><br/><p>This had happened abruptly and silently. By the time Baili Yu noticed that something was wrong and turned around to look, Tang Doudou had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu rushed to the place where Tang Doudou had been standing and looked down. Self-blame immediately filled his eyes. \u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, he crushed the item he was holding into dust. As the dust poured through his fingers and fell onto the ground, it made several shallow holes. He slammed his palm down and the attack penetrated the surface of the ground, causing the ground to start moving as if something below was stirring in response.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s expression turned grim. He had underestimated Lan Jia. He hadn\u2019t expected for Lan Jia to do something here.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou, don\u2019t be scared. I\u2019m coming to save you right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he sent another heavy strike down. A whirlpool once again appeared on the ground. The sight of it was like that of a monster opening its mouth to swallow its prey.</p><br/><p>However, Baili Yu didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest before he jumped down.</p><br/><p>The Seven Great Saint Tribes have dug everywhere that could be dug in Cerulean Mountains, so there were countless secret passages, and they were all extremely complicated. Even the people of the Saint Tribes would often get lost in them. If he didn\u2019t hurry and find Tang Doudou before she wandered off, he might never be able to find her again.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s worry wasn\u2019t wrong. After Tang Doudou fell down through that whirlpool, she found herself in another secret passage. She immediately became depressed. Were the people of the Saint Tribes reincarnation of mice?</p><br/><p>She dusted herself off, then looked up at the place where she had fallen through. The ceiling had already returned to normal as if that hole had never existed.</p><br/><p>She became depressed again. How did a whirlpool appear out of nowhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d better wait here for Baili Yu to come find me. These passages look like a mess, I probably won\u2019t be able to find my way back if I leave.\u201d After making this decision, she sat down to wait for Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>However, right after she sat down, she felt a familiar sensation from her butt. When she looked down, in the weak light that came from an unknown source, she saw that there were numerous black bugs below her feet that were crawling back and forth. Goosebumps immediately rose up all over her body.</p><br/><p>Jesus!</p><br/><p>She fell into the nest of the poisonous bugs!</p><br/><p>F*ck, this development was demanding her life!</p><br/><p>She wanted to run, but at the same time, she was worried about startling these bugs. However, if she didn\u2019t run, these bugs would eventually notice her\u2026 It was seriously a difficult decision on all ends.</p><br/><p>However, the most worrisome matter was that she was currently sitting on these poisonous bugs.</p><br/><p>Should she get up, or should she continue sitting? This was a very serious question ah!</p><br/><p>However, as she thought about this, she noticed that something was off. It had been quite some time since she had fallen down here, yet why haven\u2019t the poisonous bugs attacked her?</p><br/><p>On the contrary, they seemed to be avoiding her. The poisonous bugs that she had sat on were starting to crawl away from her.</p><br/><p>When she was on the iron chain leading to the Sacred Tree, Lan Jia had said that these bugs would have attacked her if it hadn\u2019t been for his hair tie.</p><br/><p>However, even with the hair tie, she had fallen for the hallucination these bugs induced.</p><br/><p>So she felt it strange that these bugs weren\u2019t attacking her since she didn\u2019t have anything on her that would repel bugs or their poison.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she glanced at the wedding gown she was wearing. Could it be due to this?</p><br/><p>Forget it. There was no point racking her brain over this strange development. It was great fortune that these bugs were not attacking her. That was enough.</p><br/><p>She laughed in relief and slowly stood up. Although she startled a lot of bugs, none of them attack her.</p><br/><p>She immediately felt more relieved.</p><br/><p>Following that, she took a couple steps forward. Every time her foot was about to land, those bugs would scamper off as if they were fleeing for their lives. Tang Doudou laughed. \u201cHeh, it feels like I got a really powerful ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is the big evil spirit still not here? It couldn\u2019t be that he didn\u2019t notice that I disappeared?\u201d Tang Doudou shrugged, then continued walking forward.</p><br/><p>Although the bugs didn\u2019t attack her, it was creepy to stay in a nest of bugs. She planned to find a place with less bugs and wait for Baili Yu there.</p><br/><p>However, the moment she started walking, another problem occured.</p><br/><p>A rumbling sound came from above her, and a few seconds later, an enormous thing dropped down in front of her.</p><br/><p>What the f*ck was this!?</p><br/><p>After that thing fell down, the bugs on the ground frantically fled from it while emitting screeching sounds. It was so loud Tang Doudou felt like her eardrums were about to burst.</p><br/><p>Something that even the poisonous bugs were afraid of definitely wasn\u2019t anything good. Moreover, it was humongous!</p><br/><p>These thoughts rapidly flashed through Tang Doudou\u2019s head before she reacted and ran like her life depended on it, following the poisonous bugs.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His face was deathly white and his body temperature instantly became shockingly cold!</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Chuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she couldn\u2019t wake Baili Yu, she could only call for Ye Chuan who was outside. \u201cYe Chuan! Have those doctors arrived yet!? Baili Yu, Baili Yu, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she even finished, Ye Chuan had rushed in. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw the scene inside the room, his facial color also became very unsightly. Before anyone could think any further, he turned and rushed out again.</p><br/><p>However, he soon returned, pulling an old fellow with him.</p><br/><p>The old man was dragged inside the room and thrown onto the ground by Ye Chuan. When the old man saw the scene on the bed, he ignored his disheveled clothes and immediately covered his face. Seeing this, Ye Chuan kicked him and scolded, \u201cWhat are you dawdling there for? Hurry and check what\u2019s wrong with Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man was sent straight to the bed by Ye Chuan\u2019s kick and he ended up in a position where his eyes met Tang Doudou\u2019s dead on.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a doctor?\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes lit up open seeing that a doctor had arrived. \u201cHurry up and take a look at Baili Yu\u2019s condition. He was still fine just a moment ago, but then he suddenly fainted!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man still wanted to cover his eyes when he met Tang Doudou\u2019s sparkling eyes. However, halfway through the motion, he recalled how he was kicked by Ye Chuan and stopped himself. He hastily collected his thoughts, then took Baili Yu\u2019s hand to check his pulse.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, he had only been checking for a couple breaths of time before he suddenly flung away Baili Yu\u2019s hand and stood up in shock. \u201cHow could this be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed completely shocked but he didn\u2019t explain clearly what was going on. Thus, Tang Doudou was annoyed and shouted at him, \u201cWhat is it exactly? Can\u2019t you say it clearly!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan hastily moved up and asked as well, \u201cDoctor Yu, what exactly happened to Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange ah, strange ah. It\u2019s really strange ah!\u201d Doctor Yu was completely immersed in his own world and completely ignored Tang Doudou and Ye Chuan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan immediately got angry. What kind of quack did Xu Sanniang invite? Didn\u2019t he see that Master was unconscious? Yet he\u2019s here chattering and saying \u2018strange ah\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s completely without pulse and breath and his body temperature is no different from the dead\u2026\u201d Just as Ye Chuan was about to hit the old guy again, Doctor Yu started muttering aloud to himself.</p><br/><p>However, the words he said caused Tang Doudou and Ye Chuan to break out in cold sweat. What did the old man mean!? Baili Yu was dead!?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible!\u201d Tang Doudou refuted the old man\u2019s words. \u201cI can feel his heartbeat. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle lady, don\u2019t be so riled up. Of course I know that he isn\u2019t dead. That\u2019s why it\u2019s strange ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now it seemed like Doctor Yu did have some skill in medicine. \u201cThink about it, a person\u2019s pulse, breath, and body temperature are the same as a corpse\u2019s, yet the condition of his heart is no different from that of a normal person\u2019s. Isn\u2019t that strange!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor Yu, can we discuss this later?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who cared if this was strange? Could you save the person first!?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of injuries on his back. Earlier, I used wine to disinfect them and applied medicine before wrapping them up with bandages. However, now it looks like they\u2019re all reopening again. Can you help treat his injuries before debating whether this is strange or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou got to the end, her voice started to choke with sobs. Baili Yu was about to die. That meant she was pretty much done for too!</p><br/><p>How could it be possible for her not to feel hurt?</p><br/><p>But why did she feel this sad?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li is right. Doctor Yu, you had better help treat and re-bandage Master\u2019s wounds first. Perhaps this strange phenomenon is due to those injuries. Master had forcefully circulated his energy to make himself appear uninjured earlier in order to escape from those people. I think that was what must have caused these injuries to reopen. After all, the medicine Alliance Head Li used earlier was the best injury medicine in the world. It\u2019s reasonable to say that after that much time, even the heaviest injury should have stopped bleeding.\u201d Ye Chuan stood next to the bed and spoke very calmly, but the trembling hand grasping his sword hilt betrayed his unsettled emotions.</p><br/><p>However, he still had to take charge and deal with all the current matters. If he wasn\u2019t calm, it might cause the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce to fall into turmoil. The news of Baili Yu getting injured hadn\u2019t been kept secret. There were countless people that coveted this position, not to mention numerous people that held a grudge as well. Once those people heard this news, they\u2019d definitely start making moves.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li. Though I don\u2019t like you, and I\u2019ve been on guard against you, currently, I have no choice but to request your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Yu had already started working on treating Baili Yu\u2019s injuries at Ye Chuan\u2019s request. Ye Chuan watched for a while, then directed his attention to Tang Doudou and got right to the point.</p><br/><p>Currently, all that was on Tang Doudou\u2019s mind was Baili Yu\u2019s safety. She knew that whatever Ye Chuan wanted was definitely related to Baili Yu, so she agreed without even thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever it is, just say it! I\u2019ll definitely do my utmost to help you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan felt slightly strange at Tang Doudou\u2019s straightforward reply. He had thought several times that Tang Doudou would take advantage of any chance to escape but she never did and had even looked after Master so carefully the entire way. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t such a bad person after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to go deal with some matters. I\u2019d like to ask Alliance Head Li to continue looking after Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying that for? Even if it was for my own sake I would still look after him!\u201d Tang Doudou took Baili Yu\u2019s hand and thought, Baili Yu, for my sake, you can\u2019t die ah!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

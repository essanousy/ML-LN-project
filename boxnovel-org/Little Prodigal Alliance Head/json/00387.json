Then this manor doesn\u2019t actually belong to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Feng replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t ask about the owner of the manor and instead asked, \u201cThen where is Baili gongzi\u2018s home?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had already asked this earlier so Baili Feng didn\u2019t react much to it and replied straightforwardly, \u201cWind Cloud Island.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cup Tang Doudou was holding fell to the ground and shattered.</p><br/><p>Shock flashed through her eyes but quickly vanished. She exclaimed, \u201cBaili gongzi is actually someone from Wind Cloud Island?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess I count as one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Feng didn\u2019t react much to Tang Doudou\u2019s overly strong surprise either. He just glanced at the broken tea cup, then poured Tang Doudou a new cup of tea. \u201cLady Doudou seems very shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am pretty shocked. It\u2019s very rare to see someone from Wind Cloud Island, who would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d encounter one on a casual stroll? Shouldn\u2019t I be shocked?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Feng just smiled, so Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t tell if he believed her or not.</p><br/><p>After chatting with him a while, Tang Doudou started to feel that Baili Feng was seriously very similar to Baili Yu. It wasn\u2019t just their looks or temperament, they also shared the same characteristic of being unreadable.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was pretty certain that Baili Feng knew her identity.</p><br/><p>In addition, what happened today was definitely related to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDisciples of Wind Cloud Island often head out for training, so it\u2019s not as rare as Lady Doudou puts it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. \u201cReally? I don\u2019t know much about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Doudou, do you have any other questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Since he looked like he was happy to answer all of her questions, she felt the impulse to ask all the questions she had.</p><br/><p>However, she was no longer that ignorant newbie from back then and wouldn\u2019t do such a stupid thing anymore. Since she had finally met up with Jun Xin again, she felt like leaving now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else that I really need to ask. It\u2019s already rather late, so I won\u2019t bother you any longer. Rest well, I\u2019ll take my leave for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Feng\u2019s expression remained the same as he said mildly, \u201cLady Doudou, I haven\u2019t even thanked you properly for saving me. If you don\u2019t have anything urgent, why don\u2019t you stay here in this manor so that this one can act as host for a little while to express my thanks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I still have business to deal with, but many thanks for your kind intentions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Feng\u2019s expression finally changed slightly when he heard that she was adamant about leaving. \u201cThen can Lady Doudou tell this one where you live? Once I get better, I\u2019ll pay you a visit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really no need! If Baili gongzi truly thinks of me as a friend, then please don\u2019t mention this anymore.\u201d After Tang Doudou said this, on second thought, she felt that she shouldn\u2019t completely end all ties just like this, so she said with a smile, \u201cIt just so happens that I\u2019m dealing with some business in Barbarian Mound Garrison which isn\u2019t far from here. Once I finish dealing with those matters, I\u2019ll definitely come to bother you guys for a few days. At that time, please don\u2019t turn me away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The earlier words caused Baili Feng\u2019s facial color to change, but these words made him smile again. \u201cWhat is Lady Doudou saying? I\u2019d be delighted to welcome you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t say anything else, let\u2019s call this goodbye!\u201d As Tang Doudou spoke, she stood up.</p><br/><p>Baili Feng stood up as well. \u201cAllow this one to walk you to the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Originally, Tang Doudou was going to refuse, but she changed her mind and accepted.</p><br/><p>The two left the pavilion together. Mu Qingyu frowned at the sight of this. There was nothing inappropriate about their exchange and everything Big Brother Baili said was fact. Tang Doudou also only asked the questions she had asked earlier.</p><br/><p>Could it be that she was overthinking things?</p><br/><p>Mu Qingyu stood up and went back to her room, but she couldn\u2019t help but continue to feel very uneasy. When the servant brought the egg over, she asked the servant, \u201cIs Big Brother Baili with that lady in the back garden right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant replied, \u201cNo, when I was walking here, I saw that gongzi was seeing that lady off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Qingyu feigned surprise. \u201cShe\u2019s leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. From the looks of it, that lady has some urgent business and seemed to be in a rush!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t she say earlier that she wanted a silkie?\u201d As Mu Qingyu said this, she looked towards the servant. \u201cGo ask that lady if she still wants a silkie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the silkies are gongzi\u2018s most prized possessions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi fell into the water earlier and it was this lady that saved his life. It\u2019s nothing but a few chickens, I\u2019m sure that Big Brother Baili would give one to that lady. She had saved his life after all. Just make a run and ask to make sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>That servant felt that things made a lot more sense after hearing this. It was no wonder that lady had come back with gongzi. So it turned out that she had saved his life.</p><br/><p>He immediately went to look for Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>At this time, Tang Doudou had already reached the entrance of the manor and was saluting Baili Feng goodbye. Suddenly, she saw a servant run over.</p><br/><p>She remembered that this was the servant she had instructed to help boil an egg for Mu Qingyu, so she couldn\u2019t help but glance over. Could it be that something had happened to Mu Qingyu?</p><br/><p>Baili Feng noticed her gaze and looked over as well. When he saw his servant\u2019s improper behavior, he frowned and berated lightly, \u201cWhat kind of propriety is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi!\u201d The servant was gasping for breath. \u201cI have something urgent to ask this lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>When had his servant gotten familiar with Tang Doudou?</p><br/><p>Baili Feng was a little surprised. \u201cWhat matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little one greets Lady.\u201d The servant bowed towards Tang Doudou, then peeked at Baili Feng\u2019s expression. When he saw that Baili Feng seemed to be very polite towards this lady, he finally felt reassured enough to ask, \u201cI\u2019m here to ask Lady if you still want that silkie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilkie?\u201d Embarrassment appeared on Tang Doudou\u2019s face. She was confused for a moment since she had only talked to Mu Qingyu about this. There hadn\u2019t been anyone else present at this time, so how did this servant learn about this?</p><br/><p>Was it Mu Qingyu that told him?</p><br/><p>But why?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t she already tell Mu Qingyu not to bring this up anymore?</p><br/><p>And how did she know that she was about to leave?</p><br/><p>Countless thoughts flashed through her mind as she turned to look at Baili Feng.</p><br/><p>Then she discovered that he was also looking at her strangely. \u201cLady Doudou wants to take a silkie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d How was she supposed to respond to this?</p><br/><p>Inwardly, she sighed. What exactly was Mu Qingyu trying to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cI do raise quite a few silkies in this manor, but these silkies are a little different from ordinary silkies. Lady, if you want one, please go take a look first. If you\u2019re certain that you want one after taking a look, I\u2019ll gift one to you.\u201d He could tell from the look on her face that she had asked for one. Mu Qingyu had probably brought up the silkies at some point, but he was surprised that she actually had an interest in them.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I was just asking casually. I never thought that Lady Mu would take it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking a look at them won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s interest was aroused since it occurred to her that Mu Qingyu might have been trying to tell her some sort of news through this?</p><br/><p>When she thought about it, this really was possible. Based on that lady\u2019s personality, she probably wasn\u2019t the type to lay schemes and stab someone behind their back.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou got to this conclusion, she nodded and said, \u201cAlright, then let\u2019s go take a look. I\u2019m really curious how different the silkies at Baili gongzi\u2018s house are.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

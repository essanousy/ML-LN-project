You\u2019re smiling so much, that means you got definite news?\u201d Although she was smiling when they came, the smile didn\u2019t reach the depths of her eyes. However, after coming back from where Mu Ye brought her, she was lit up with smiles.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sat down next to him and then copied the way he was lying down. Her eyes curved into a smile as she said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I got news. He\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t die anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t die anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, talk, what do you want to do?\u201d Jun Xin flipped around to face Tang Doudou, his eyes flickering with light.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou yawned without looking at him. \u201cI\u2019ll go by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you feel like I\u2019d agree?\u201d Jun Xin gave a disdainful humph.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou really wanted to give this kid a beating. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she couldn\u2019t beat him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t allow anyone to find out about Baili Yu and two people would be too conspicuous. It\u2019d be much easier for me to travel alone and\u2026 you have to help me get rid of those tails from the shadows.\u201d Tang Doudou turned around and patted Jun Xin\u2019s chest. \u201cStinkin\u2019 brat, this is a really important matter, you\u2019d better help me properly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s too worrying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a crucial time, so don\u2019t be so spoiled and stubborn.\u201d Tang Doudou rolled her eyes as she continued, \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones that can know about this, so help me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin bit his lips. Spoiled and stubborn? Was this the way she viewed him?</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll help!\u201d His eyes then whirled with an idea. \u201cBut you have to promise me something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you help, I\u2019d agree even to ten conditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s elope?\u201d Jun Xin laughed. When he saw that Tang Doudou\u2019s expression was rapidly turning dark, he quickly changed his tune. \u201cI\u2019m just joking, don\u2019t take it so seriously!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! I wasn\u2019t taking it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019d be able to relax if you go by yourself. Since you\u2019re worried about your whereabouts being revealed, I\u2019ll just protect you from the shadows. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at him. If she didn\u2019t agree to this suggestion, he\u2019d probably lock her up to keep her from heading out alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it. I\u2019m telling you, before we find Baili Yu, you should give up all hopes of shaking me off,\u201d stated Jun Xin firmly.</p><br/><p>Then he got up and flicked off the leaves on his clothes. Licking his lips, he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t delay this matter, so let\u2019s head back to Huai City today. Once I finish dealing with the most pressing tasks, you should sneak out of Plum Garden and I\u2019ll follow you from the shadows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two rushed back to Plum Garden. Tang Doudou found some time to go see Baili Yiling, but when she saw that Baili Yiling was still busy, she only chatted a little before she left and returned to her own room.</p><br/><p>As she waited for news from Jun Xin, she started wandering around the room. Jun Xin had told her that he had put her box in a cabinet.</p><br/><p>After rummaging through the room for a long time, she finally found the wooden box that was wrapped in a wedding garment in the cabinet that contained her clothes.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou saw the red garments, she couldn\u2019t help but feel sad. However, she soon recovered and nimbly untied the garment to open the box. It still contained the same things that she had seen in the hidden room. She fiddled with them, but couldn\u2019t figure out how to cure the Hoarfrost Poison with them.</p><br/><p>However, for the time being, she decided to keep them with her since Baili Yu would probably know how to use them when she found him.</p><br/><p>She was in the process of putting them away with Jun Xin came back.</p><br/><p>When he saw that she was putting away the things in that box, he said with a laugh, \u201cBack then, you were clutching that box so tightly that I thought it was Baili Yu\u2019s ashes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Blabbermouth of a stinkin\u2019 brat.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glared at him. \u201cAlways talking nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin laughed. \u201cEverything\u2019s ready. You can slip out tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. \u201cAlright, thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d She could tell he was up to something just by the way his eyes rolled around.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin licked his lips. \u201cAfter you head out this time, it\u2019ll probably be a while before you have a chance to cook again, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, he was thinking that even after they found Baili Yu, she probably wouldn\u2019t have time to cook again. In addition, it really wouldn\u2019t be right for him to keep hovering around her once Baili Yu came back because she was already married.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou knew that it would be about food. She put the box away, then stood up and slapped the table. \u201cLet\u2019s go, chowhound!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin smiled slightly. \u201cThis way, Chef.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou prepared a large feast for Jun Xin and fed him until his stomach turned completely round before he was satisfied enough to let her back.</p><br/><p>Since it was afternoon, she took a nap, and when she woke up again, it was already night.</p><br/><p>She got up and ate the meal the servants had brought over, then picked up the cloth bundle she had prepared. She had already extinguished the candles, so once she was ready, she quietly climbed out from the window.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had already arranged for the hidden guards near her courtyard to be in other places, so even if she swaggered out, no one would see her. However, for the sake of making the act complete, she tiptoed out of the courtyard and quickly jumped over the tall wall.</p><br/><p>Once she got out of Plum Garden, she left Huai City on horseback.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was dressed in black and wearing a silver mask as he followed her from the shadows.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou decided to head to Dream Mountain first. It was fortunate that she had taken a nap in the afternoon because now she could travel through the night. She reached the inn right before dawn.</p><br/><p>\u201cShopkeeper? Waiter?\u201d She entered the inn but didn\u2019t see anyone.</p><br/><p>She had only been gone for a day. Where did all the people go?</p><br/><p>The inn was still unrepaired. Could it be that they had gone into town to find someone that could fix this place up?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou casually picked a room and went to sleep. When she woke up again, it was near night. She ate a bit of dry rations and was just about to continue traveling when someone appeared in the room.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

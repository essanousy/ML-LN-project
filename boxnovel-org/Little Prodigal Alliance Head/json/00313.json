It looked as if he didn\u2019t want to bother with this Uncle Tao at all.</p><br/><p>However, the other young men behind him started greeting Uncle Tao politely. Through their words, Tang Doudou found out that this guy was actually the country magistrate of Hibiscus Garrison.</p><br/><p>However, the grand county magistrate was actually so polite towards this young man. Tang Doudou rubbed her chin thoughtfully, and her motion attracted County Magistrate Tao\u2019s attention. \u201cNephew Lin, this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, look at this memory of mine, I almost forgot to introduce you. Uncle Tao, this is Tang Longbiao, Brother Tang. We hit off at first sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, he turned around and said to Tang Doudou, \u201cBrother Tang, this is the county magistrate of Hibiscus Garrison, Tao daren. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cThis junior greets Tao daren,\u201d said Tang Doudou in a manner that was neither overbearing or servile as she cupped her fist.</p><br/><p>When County Magistrate saw the way she cupped her fist, he came to the conclusion that she was just a barbaric man of the Jianghu and must have used some sort of scheme to get close to Young Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Once his thoughts reached this point, scorn appeared in his eyes and he didn\u2019t even bother to return Tang Doudou\u2019s greeting and just turned to Lin Shuxuan. \u201cNephew Lin has walked far, you must be tired? Let\u2019s go, come sit here and taste the new tea I just got.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way Lin Shuxuan could miss the scorn County Magistrate Tao had towards Tang Doudou. Displeasure appeared on his face and he rejected County Magistrate Tao\u2019s invitation. \u201cMany thanks for Uncle Tao\u2019s kind invitation, but I\u2019d prefer to stay with Brother Tang. Young men tend to have a lot to talk about, so I hope Uncle Tao won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>County Magistrate Tao hadn\u2019t thought that Lin Shuxuan would reject him in front of everyone just for the sake of a Jianghu man. His expression turned a bit unsightly, but when he saw that no one around seemed to have noticed, he forced a smile and said, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I won\u2019t disturb you young ones. But, my family\u2019s girl\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Uncle Tao, I\u2019ll definitely pay a visit once I have time and visit my little sister Yurong while I\u2019m at it.\u201d How could Lin Shuxuan possibly miss County Magistrate Tao\u2019s intentions? If it weren\u2019t for that fact that his daughter, Tao Yurong, had pretty good looks, why would he call this county magistrate uncle?</p><br/><p>\u201cThose with dog eyes can\u2019t help but look down on others.\u201d Lin Shuxuan sneered at County Magistrate\u2019s back, then looked towards Tang Doudou apologetically. \u201cBrother Tang, this county magistrate is just ignorant. I hope you won\u2019t take offense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin is joking. Just because he\u2019s ignorant doesn\u2019t mean that I should be petty as well.\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s sparkling eyes filled with a profound smile as she emitted a casual but powerful aura. She glanced around, then picked a comfortable looking seat and sat down. Her relaxed and self-assured manner made Lin Shuxuan even more certain that she wasn\u2019t an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>An ordinary person wouldn\u2019t have such an aura.</p><br/><p>In addition, when he looked closely, he noticed that though Tang Longbiao had thick eyebrows, his eyes were unusually beautiful. Actually, it should be said that his entire appearance was very handsome and beautiful. It was just that his two mustache strips added a coarse gruffness to his appearance and the moles on his face messed with that image of beauty. Then there was the fact that though his figure was large, his movements were as smooth as if he was gliding. Once one looked closely, one would be captivated.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was aware that Lin Shuxuan was sizing her up, but she paid no attention to it and just lifted the cup of tea to take a light sip before placing it back down.</p><br/><p>The movement was fluid as water. If the person hadn\u2019t lived in such a comfortable and relaxed way for a long time, they wouldn\u2019t be able to exude such grace.</p><br/><p>The more Lin Shuxuan thought about it, the more depressed he felt. Not even he could affect such graceful bearings. Who exactly was Tang Longbiao? And why did he come to Hibiscus Garrison? Could it really have been to investigate that matter?</p><br/><p>These thoughts all took place in just the span of a few moments. He soon reached Tang Doudou and sat down near her. As he opened his fan, he asked, \u201cDoes Brother Tang know the origin of this Hibiscus?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything Tang Doudou had done earlier was for the sake of impressing Lin Shuxuan so that he would take the initiative to offer information.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Lady Hibiscus isn\u2019t someone of Hibiscus Garrison?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Shuxuan smiled mysteriously, then leaned over to whisper, \u201cHibiscus is only a title, it\u2019s not actually pointing to a specific lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded in understanding. \u201cSo it was like that. Then why are these ladies taking on the title \u2018Hibiscus?\u2019 Could it that there\u2019s some story behind this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Shuxuan smiled as he fanned himself slowly. \u201cThere is a story. It\u2019s said that about twenty years ago, a beautiful woman with looks stunning enough to overturn a city came to live in this Hibiscus Garrison. When people asked her for her name, she just said with a smile, I had cut off ties with my past, so from now on, just call me Hibiscus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was definitely a woman with stories.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if she had stories in the past, but I know that ever since she came, Hibiscus Garrison became exceptionally beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn. It\u2019s said that not only was she beautiful, she knew a lot and would teach the residents for free.\u201d</p><br/><p>There actually existed this kind of woman? A woman that possessed beauty and talent, and was also that kind?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou became interested and asked, \u201cShe sounds wonderful. She definitely had a lot of admirers, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, that\u2019s only natural, but those are all small things. The thing most worthy of mention is that she was very skilled in medicine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was even more stunned. \u201cBeautiful, talented, kind, and is skilled in medicine? Tsk tsk, if this kind of woman was in the Imperial City, she\u2019d probably be pursued by the entire country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Shuxuan\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cBrother Tang is very familiar with the Imperial City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s heart dropped. Crap, she had been too engrossed in this news and ended up making a slip.</p><br/><p>However, she remained unperturbed on the surface. \u201cMy ancestors had once moved out of the Imperial City, so I often hear my elders talk about the Imperial City and their customs. However, it isn\u2019t enough to be described as familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After taking a light sip, he slowly spat out a sentence that caused Tang Doudou to almost go off(explode): \u201cDepends on my mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! Then if your mood stays bad the entire time, wouldn\u2019t that mean certain death for me?\u201d It concerned her small life so Tang Doudou stood up with a \u2018whoosh\u2019 and anxiously walked towards Baili Yu. However, before she could even approach her foot slipped and she took a dog-eating-mud fall.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the ground was completely covered with thick fox fur, so it didn\u2019t hurt. She got back up in a fluster but before she was able to stand firm she almost fell again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The hell, what\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s eyes were filled with a questioning expression as he looked at Tang Doudou who after tripping got up again and got up only to fall down again. He couldn\u2019t help but feel puzzled. Even though this fox fur is soft and slippery it\u2019s not slippery to this degree, is it?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After several repetitions, Tang Doudou\u2019s thick face was completely red. She was helpless, her legs couldn\u2019t help but go soft. No matter what they wouldn\u2019t stand steadily so she could only sit gloomily on the floor. Could this be the residual effects of seeing a lady-killer?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Meowoo, this is too embarrassing!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Xueyi.\u201d Baili Yu suddenly called.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou froze for a while before she reacted: \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t remember anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What is he asking about this for? Tang Doudou saw some unknown emotions flash through Baili Yu\u2019s peach blossom eyes. A wave of fog filled up her brain again, what drama is going on now?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Not waiting for her to ask, Baili Yu closed his eyes, his long thick eyelashes casting faint shadows: \u201cIf you don\u2019t remember then that\u2019s also good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This sentence was light as a feather and stroked lightly against Tang Doudou\u2019s heart. When she came to reflect on it, she already no longer remembered what it was that he had said.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin, bring Alliance Head Li to rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Following this sentence, the palanquin doors opened. A gentle force fell on Tang Doudou\u2019s body and in a blink had sent her outside the palanquin. She still wanted to ask him when his mood would get better but the palanquin doors had already closed with a \u2018bang\u2019.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The four maids carrying the palanquin seemed to be about to leave again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hurriedly rushed over. Without Baili Yu\u2019s order, the maids didn\u2019t stop her either so with a few steps she already made it to the door and plastered her body against it. She used strength to hit the door: \u201cHey! Baili Yu, how can you be like this ah! What in the world do you want to do ah! When will your mood get better ah, at least give me a timeframe ah! If you close the door like this how am I supposed to find you ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu! Baili Yu! Did you go mute? Say something ah!\u201d Tang Doudou shouted and pounded but for a long time still didn\u2019t hear Baili Yu reply. Bottled up anger rushed out and she lifted her foot, about to kick through the door.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin quickly stopped her: \u201cLi gongzi, you must not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t have the leisure to pay attention to her and used strength to pound on the door a couple more times: \u201cBaili Yu, if you still don\u2019t say anything then I\u2019m going to smash this door!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi! Don\u2019t hit it anymore!\u201d Qing Yin was scared to the point her little face turned deathly white. This Alliance Head Li looks so delicate and refined, how could he be so boorish in manners. Did he not know that this Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin of Master\u2019s is something that even they usually couldn\u2019t approach? Just now it was because the incident occurred so suddenly, that was the only reason Master let him sit inside for a while. Pounding and hitting it like this, does he really not want his life anymore?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing they couldn\u2019t stop Tang Doudou, Qing Yin and the other maids were considering using force to pull her away. Otherwise, when Master gets angry they would also suffer calamity along with her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen my mood improves then I\u2019ll have Qing Yin bring you over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After quite a while, Baili Yu finally replied indifferently.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou asked with suspicion. For some reason, from the bottom of her heart she felt like Baili Yu could not be trusted.</p><br/><p>But Baili Yu didn\u2019t say anymore. It was not that he didn\u2019t want to speak, but there were still some things he needed to confirm.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pounded again several times and repeatedly asked, but this time no matter what Baili Yu would not speak.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In all the time they\u2019ve followed Baili Yu, Qing Yin and the others have never seen him be this patient towards anyone. But Tang Doudou was still not willing to overlook nor spare so she could only try to persuade him: \u201cLi gongzi. Why don\u2019t you follow this servant and go to get some rest? It\u2019s already 3am, if there\u2019s any business saying it tomorrow isn\u2019t too late ah! Master has already brought you to the Chamber of Commerce. Staying at the Chamber of Commerce, what does gongzi still have to be afraid of not being able to find Master for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cNot to mention Master always goes to rest as soon as nightfalls. Today he\u2019s already made an exception until now. Qing Yin beseech you let Master off and go rest as well!\u201d As she spoke, Qing Yin\u2019s voice even carried a tearful tone.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026\u2026 Looking at the tear-stained face of a beauty that seemed like raindrops on a pear blossom, Tang Doudou also couldn\u2019t very well continue. It was precisely as she said, they were even living together, everything can be dealt with slowly!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In fact, Tang Doudou was also tired.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She had happily gone on a trip. That night it was got too late so she found a random hotel to sleep in, who expected that when she woke up she had came to this lousy place.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>And then there wasn\u2019t any time to relax. First there was the black-clothed men of the Demonic Sect that caused her to almost lose her little life, then there was Elder Yu\u2019s pressing pursuit at every step, following that appeared another Baili Yu\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Enduring to this final part, an unfathomable poison was even pulled out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>The Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin emitted a faint glow under the moonlight. Tang Doudou who was in front of the palanquin withdrew her hand rather regretfully. Turning her gaze towards Qing Yin, she said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was too impulsive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin lightly shook her head: \u201cIt\u2019s good that gongzi was able to think it through. Then please follow Qing Yin this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Only now did Tang Doudou have the time to look around to see where exactly she ended up at.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It was still a courtyard.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Under the dark curtain of night, all she could tell was that this courtyard was very big. It was more spacious than the Rutaceae Pavilion\u2019s courtyard by some unknown folds. The lights were sparse and small, causing it to seem a bit lonely and desolate.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin said: \u201cMaster hasn\u2019t returned to this garden for quite a long time. Master likes peace and quiet, so there aren\u2019t very many servants in this yard. Due to this, it looks a bit deserted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIn Baili Yu\u2019s home there\u2019s only him himself?\u201d From what Tang Doudou could see, Baili Yu was really similar to those flashy second generation rich kids.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Being the richest man in the world at such a young age, if he really built it from scratch then wouldn\u2019t this man be a little too scary!? Besides, that palanquin described as priceless by Xi Qiuyue and the way he appeared with all that flamboyant fluttering petals accompanied by all sorts of maids, even bringing his own background music; these things are things the average people could never think of.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>And this is all because Baili Yu\u2019s appearance and temperament are way too like a demonic seductive yao, yet within that characteristic he still carried the air of a lofty immortal. Only because of this could he manage to successfully appear in such a grandiose style.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>If the person were to be swapped, for example for someone like Elder Yu\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Pfff!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Imagining Elder Yu\u2019s bearded hairy face in the midst of that intoxicating scene with pink flower petals elegantly fluttering around.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t able to hold it back and a giggle bursted out. That image was seriously too perfect, she didn\u2019t dare to continue imagining.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin watched Tang Doudou with a curious gaze as Tang Doudou started laughing more and more exaggeratedly. In the end, she laughed until she couldn\u2019t even stand steadily and leaned against the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin panting for breath.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What in the world did he think of? Is it that funny?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin was particularly puzzled. How could a person\u2019s mood change so fast? Just a few moments ago he was still inconsolable and indignant, yet in the blink of an eye he started laughing to the point he couldn\u2019t tell north from south.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing that the hour was getting later and later, Qing Yin could only move up and pull Tang Doudou: \u201cLi gongzi, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOk ok, going going! God, I\u2019m dying from laughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pulled Qing Yin\u2019s hand over, slightly forgetting about her male identity: \u201cQing Yin, your name is Qing Yin, right? Let me tell you ah! You remember that Elder Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin\u2019s little face was red. She wanted to take her hand back but was also scared of angering Tang Doudou to the point that Tang Doudou would refuse to leave with her, so she endured. Turning her hand over, she pulled Tang Doudou\u2019s hand and walked forward: \u201cThis servant is called Qing Yin. Wonder what gongzi suddenly thought of to cause you to laugh so happily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to know then I won\u2019t tell you! Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi, you\u2019re so mean!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>As the voices of the two gradually grew faint, their figures also disappeared into the darkness of the path ahead. A maid came to the front of the palanquin and was just about to carry the palanquin away when she suddenly cried in shock: \u201cAiyah*! Master!\u201d </p><br/><p>Aiyah is an interjection of wonder, shock or admiration</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Baili Yu naturally also knew what she was shocked about and his tone was a bit displeased. A trace of fury even appeared on his fair face. This Li Xueyi sure has grown some guts after losing his memories! To actually take advantage of the time when her wild laughter drew everyone\u2019s attention to pick out those two gems on the palanquin door.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing Master infuriated, the maid hurriedly close her mouth. Not waiting for Baili Yu\u2019s command, she immediately lifted up the palanquin and headed into the night.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had no clue that Baili Yu simply never planned to stay in the same courtyard as her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>At present she was currently chatting and joking with Qing Yin as they walked to the front of a guest room. On the entire way here, she felt that Qing Yin\u2019s personality was particularly her type so she pulled at Qing Yin and chattered incessantly without end, as if she greatly regretted not having met earlier.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>When they got to the door, Qing Yin was just about to withdraw when Tang Doudou stopped her: \u201cQing Yin, why don\u2019t you just sleep with me tonight? While we sleep we can continue chatting, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Qing Yin was frightened to the point she trembled, almost flinging away her hand.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Although she was Baili Yu\u2019s servant, but in reality she was much more pampered than many of the girls from wealthy families. Most days, other than Baili Yu there were no others that dared to order them to do this or that, don\u2019t even mention such an offensive demand like sleeping with a guest.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But then again, Master had never received a guest before. Li Xueyi has broken several precedents in a row.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Due to this, she also didn\u2019t dare to offend Li Xueyi and could only let him continue to grab her hand. She showed a troubled expression: \u201cLi gongzi, I still have to go back to serve Master so I cannot stay for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYour family\u2019s Master is so stingy!\u201d Tang Doudou pushed open the door and peeked inside. it was pretty wide and spacious.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster treats all of us very well.\u201d Qing Yin was a bit frustrated. She completely didn\u2019t understand why Li Xueyi was so deeply prejudiced towards Master. She had followed at Master\u2019s side ever since she was a child and had never seen him treat anyone this well before. This Li Xueyi seriously doesn\u2019t know how to be content with one\u2019s situation. If he wasn\u2019t a man, she would even think that Master had fallen for him.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Oh\u2026\u2026 Master also wasn\u2019t a child anymore, it should be about time to get married.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But all these years, other then them sisters, Master had never gotten close to any girl before. Now, to actually treat Li Xueyi this well, perhaps\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin was stunned by her own thoughts and blanked out. Master actually liked men?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She immediately flung away this unrealistic thought. Master, that immortal-like being, how could he be homosexual!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But looking again at Tang Doudou, his face was pampered and charming, bright and refreshing. A white robe danced elegantly and was rather similar to Master\u2019s temperament. Recalling the image just now of Master catching Tang Doudou, there was also an immortal companions-like flavor.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>His figure was much thinner than most men. At first glance he was quite like a girl.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Could it be, this was precisely the type Master likes? Forget it, as long as Master likes them, whether it\u2019s a man or a woman doesn\u2019t matter. Not to mention, the opposite party is still an Alliance Head after all, it still counts as quite well-matched in terms of social status with Master.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>For the sake of Baili Yu\u2019s marriage affairs, servant girl Qing Yin also worried to the point her heart was fragmented.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your family\u2019s Master, of course you\u2019d say that!\u201d Tang Doudou let go of Qing Yin\u2019s hand, saying in her heart that she couldn\u2019t cause trouble for her. Anyways, she was staying here so there would be a lot more chances.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, if she\u2019s by herself it\u2019d also be useful in planning out what to do in the future. Continuing to be moved about like this isn\u2019t a solution.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin released a breath of relief. She was afraid Tang Doudou will continue to persist. Fortunately he was still quite reasonable and didn\u2019t persist much.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Li gongzi should head to rest soon. Qing Yin will head over here again tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by LazyMiyu, Proofread by Ocelot</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>I love chapters like this~ So easy to translate~</p><br/><p>Trivia: The Chinese phrase for homosexual translates to \u201ccut sleeve\u201d.

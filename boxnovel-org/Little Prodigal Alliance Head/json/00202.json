By the time she finished glancing through the crowd, her feet had already stepped onto the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy good disciple, come sit over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she got onto the stage, Su Yi patted the seat next to him with a beaming smile.</p><br/><p>Usually, Tang Doudou definitely would have rolled her eyes and refused to sit over there but since today\u2019s situation was unique, she decided to give him some face. She smiled faintly and walked over.</p><br/><p>Su Yi was a little surprised to see her so well-behaved, but he soon realized what she was thinking.</p><br/><p>However, it was good that she was a little more well-behaved. That would be one less thing for him to worry about.</p><br/><p>After Tang Doudou sat down next to Su Yi, she discovered that this guy had seriously arranged stuff well. From this seat, the entire plaza was within view; she had a feeling as if she was overlooking the entire world.</p><br/><p>Su Yi, this old brat, sure didn\u2019t fear the idea of \u2018the higher you sit, the harder the fall.\u2019 First was that golden yellow palanquin and now he was sitting so high up. His desire to rebel was clear as day ah!</p><br/><p>But, would he care about that position?</p><br/><p>Probably not\u2026</p><br/><p>She had started mulling over those thoughts again and hence didn\u2019t hear any of what Su Yi said. Su Yi had coughed quite a few times and stomped on her foot under the table before she came back to her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi glowered at her. \u201cAbout what I said earlier, do you feel that it\u2019s good or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he say earlier?</p><br/><p>A trace of confusion flashed through her eyes. She sensed that everyone below was looking at her, and became even more bewildered. When Su Yi impatiently urged her again, she nodded without thinking. She came back to her senses and was just about to shake her head when she heard Su Yi say with a refreshed laugh, \u201cSince my family\u2019s darling disciple has said it\u2019s good, then the matter is settled!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s settled?\u201d Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but ask in a small voice.</p><br/><p>Su Yi slanted a glance at her. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you once we get back. For now, sit up properly and pull out the demeanor of an unmarried daughter of a noble house. All you have to do is watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>The demeanor of an unmarried daughter of a noble house?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou really wanted to cover her head. When did she ever get something like that?</p><br/><p>However, Su Yi didn\u2019t care if she had it. He lifted his chin slightly and the manager standing to the side immediately bowed and walked towards the center of the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are honored that all of you have come to participate in our Young City Lord\u2019s martial arts matchmaking convention!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was seriously a never-changing opening remark!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone has probably already heard of our Young City Lord, Li Xueyi! Thus, I won\u2019t bother with an introduction. Next, I\u2019ll be talking about the rules in this matchmaking competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is different from other martial arts matchmaking competition. Our City Lord believes in the idea that true strength is only when one\u2019s own fist is strong. Hence, participants are not allowed to have substitutes participate for them and must participate themselves. If an imposter is discovered, the person will lose the right to participate and will also be added to Cloud City\u2019s blacklist! Thus, we hope everyone will think things through carefully before making a decision!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the people below saw that he was serious, they immediately started discussing worriedly.</p><br/><p>Following that, the manager cleared his throat and said, \u201cThere are no restrictions on the eligibility of participants. As long as your fist is strong enough and you can defeat all the opponents in front of you, you can carry our family\u2019s Young City Lord home!\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard that they could carry a beauty home as long as they won the fight, many of them immediately threw the manager\u2019s earlier words to the back of their heads. One even asked loudly, \u201cThen what City Lord Su said before about wealth and precious treasure isn\u2019t necessary anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! My friend, you didn\u2019t hear wrong, that is precisely it! As of now, as long as your fist is strong enough, you can carry the beauty home, and can even possess all the wealth and power of Cloud City! This is such a great deal, what are you still waiting for? Hurry up and come on stage! Let our Young City Lord witness your heroic form, your outstanding talent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfff!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou coughed out blood, then glared resentfully at Su Yi. Da fudge? Was this a martial arts matchmaking competition or a sales promotion event?</p><br/><p>And it was even, buy one get one free!</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, this is called setting the atmosphere. Look, don\u2019t the people below look completely heated up as if they itched to come up and battle three hundred rounds?\u201d However, a certain person didn\u2019t feel like this action was inappropriate at all and even sent her a delighted look of \u2018I\u2019m so smart.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. \u201cIf the one that wins in the end is ugly, don\u2019t blame me for flipping out and directly stomping off!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, how could that be possible? My dear disciple, even if you want to marry an ugly person, as the master I wouldn\u2019t allow it!\u201d Su Yi laughed \u2018hehe,\u2019 then started whispering his plan to Tang Doudou. \u201cFirst of all, I only did this after careful consideration. Look, which person on the Jianghu with amazing martial arts doesn\u2019t have impressive looks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou thought about it and realized that it was true. However, what did that have to do with this?</p><br/><p>When she was offstage, all the people she saw were fat and short uglies. She hadn\u2019t seen a single one of the type that Su Yi had described.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had pretty good looks, but she didn\u2019t count him in at all.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue\u2019s looks were also decent, it was just that he was too old and also drank heavily\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThose people are of course the main act, how could they come so early? Didn\u2019t you notice that even Baili Yu, that little fox, still isn\u2019t here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps he doesn\u2019t plan on coming at all,\u201d muttered Tang Doudou. She had originally been disappointed to see that Baili Yu wasn\u2019t here, but now that Su Yi said this, she secretly started to anticipate again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if he doesn\u2019t come, I\u2019ll help you get him here!\u201d said Su Yi with a nefarious smile.</p><br/><p>It surprised Tang Doudou. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hate him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s expression turned sincere and he spoke seemingly seriously, \u201cI\u2019ve been walking through the city these past two days and found that he was actually a little pleasing to the eye. Moreover, you two like each other. How could I break apart a pair of mandarin ducks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he put it nicely, wasn\u2019t what he was doing right now precisely breaking apart a pair of mandarin ducks?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

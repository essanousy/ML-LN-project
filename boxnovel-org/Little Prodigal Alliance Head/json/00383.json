Once Alliance Head comes, I\u2019ll definitely ask Alliance Head to deal with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! If you have the guts, you should just kill me. Since you don\u2019t dare to kill me, stop trying to distract everyone with pointless words.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person arguing with Shen Wuming was from the faction that Shen Wuming had murdered a member of. However, he didn\u2019t seem to the be leader of the syndicate.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone will kill you sooner or later! We just don\u2019t want to dirty our own hands!\u201d replied that person fiercely.</p><br/><p>Shen Wuming humphed in disdain. \u201cThe fact that you don\u2019t dare means you don\u2019t dare. Just admit it, fake bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother He, don\u2019t be so stirred up. There\u2019s no point arguing with someone like this,\u201d said Elder Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t swallow this anger!\u201d The man with the surname He glared at Shen Wuming as if glaring at him could take off his flesh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t swallow the anger, why wait? He Shuiyi, you should\u2019ve just killed him when Jun Xin knocked him out earlier to avenge your poor disciples, but now\u2026 Haha, everyone is smart, there\u2019s no need to put on such an act. Let\u2019s just get to the point, how exactly should Shen Wuming be dealt with? He has killed people from multiple families before this. Elder Yu, you should give everyone a clear answer!\u201d</p><br/><p>The person that spoke was Jin Fengyi from the Gold Sword Faction.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Jin is right, Elder Yu, you must give us a decision. There\u2019s no way we can just let him off like this! That\u2019d be letting him off easily!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the reason I brought Shen Wuming here is because I wanted to wait for Alliance Head to come and make the decision on what to do with him.\u201d Elder Yu has always been like this. Whenever he encountered something he couldn\u2019t resolve, he\u2019d just push it off to her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou cursed when she heard this. This bunch of rotten old men!</p><br/><p>\u201cZi!\u201d Right at this time, Little Gray started shouting.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily stood up and looked around in alarm as she whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Little Gray, did that person from earlier show up again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Gray shook his head, then nodded with a confused expression.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t tell what he meant. She glanced one last time at the noisy hall, then ducked down and went to hide behind a decorative mountain.</p><br/><p>Little Gray was still gesturing something, but Tang Doudou didn\u2019t have the time to pay attention to him since she could sense someone approaching!</p><br/><p>Her gaze darkened slightly. She was wondering whether it was that person when a black shadow suddenly crossed the edge of her vision. She hastily turned around but was too late to catch him.</p><br/><p>Little Gray pointed behind her and cried, \u201cZizizi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily turned around again but didn\u2019t see anyone there.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really that person?\u201d asked Tang Doudou quietly. Little Gray pointed out the person\u2019s location again.</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou knew that this wasn\u2019t a solution. She couldn\u2019t tell where that person was nor see him, she was at too much of a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Her eyes suddenly lit up and she ran forward while pouring energy into her dantian. Suddenly, she shouted, \u201cWho\u2019s there!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment her shout resounded, there was the sound of chairs being overturned in the main hall and many people soon appeared.</p><br/><p>The first to appear were some of the strongest martial artists. When they saw her, they hastily walked over. \u201cGreeting, Alliance Head. May I ask why you shouted earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou saw that more people were coming up and Little Gray didn\u2019t warn her again that the person was approaching, so she loosened a breath in relief. She decided to tell them about that strange person while they were all here.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this means that Alliance Head, you\u2019ve already encountered that person?\u201d asked someone in shock.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded, then told them about how the people from the Lin and Xiao families were killed in the blink of an eye. After all this, she finally said, \u201cI discovered him just now as well, but I wasn\u2019t able to see where he was.\u201d</p><br/><p>This news was frightening. Someone that scary was actually right in this courtyard?</p><br/><p>Right after she said this, people started looking around warily in an attempt to figure out where that person was.</p><br/><p>However, they didn\u2019t see anyone around.</p><br/><p>Due to this, they became even more tense in worry that the person would suddenly appear right next to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t panic. We have such great numbers, he wouldn\u2019t dare to make a move\u2026\u201d said someone from the happy-go-lucky sect.</p><br/><p>Although these words weren\u2019t completely illogical, just as everyone was about to agree, a scream suddenly came from the crowd!</p><br/><p>Everyone heart tensed. It happened after all!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

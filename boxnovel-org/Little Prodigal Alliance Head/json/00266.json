He had only entrusted Tang Doudou to Lan Jia without worries because Lan Jia told him that Shen Moru hadn\u2019t come back to Saint City. However, just then he had sensed the ripple of cold energy caused by Mu Ye\u2019s ice demon martial arts. He knew right away that something had happened.</p><br/><p>He immediately rushed towards that direction without paying any more attention to Nangong Yan. From a distance away, he could already see that there were a lot of black-robed figures here. He saw that Mu Ye was currently occupied with fighting Shen Moru, but couldn\u2019t see Tang Doudou anywhere.</p><br/><p>He was worried that it would be too late if he delayed any longer, so he immediately used Three Thousand Overlooking Blossoms to kill the group of black-clothed men. The black-clothed men fell one after another, but he still didn\u2019t see Tang Doudou anywhere.</p><br/><p>He looked around nervously for Tang Doudou, but due to the fact that there were black-clothed men everywhere, he couldn\u2019t find her. His worst fear was that he would accidentally injure her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he sensed a strange gaze on him and abruptly turned around. Shen Moru had managed to get away from Mu Ye and his black smoke-like body quickly moved towards a certain location. When his body once again condensed, he was already behind Tang Doudou who was kneeling in the middle of countless corpses.</p><br/><p>His withered claw-like fingers were pressed against Tang Doudou\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop now or I\u2019ll kill her!\u201d Shen Moru shouted at Mu Ye, but his gaze once again landed on Baili Yu. \u201cHa. You\u2019ve come as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye made to fly over when he saw that Shen Moru had caught Tang Doudou, so Shen Moru tightened his grasp a little. Tang Doudou\u2019s face immediately turned pale in response. \u201cIf you want her to die here, then you can try taking another step forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye abruptly came to a halt. His cold gaze swept across Baili Yu\u2019s face and his tightly pressed together lips moved a little bit, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu pulled off his black robe to reveal his garments that was as red as blood. The hems of his crimson garments lifted in the wind along with his black hair. His tone was even colder Mu Ye\u2019s eyes. \u201cShen Moru, you\u2019re seeking death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili gongzi really has such an impressive aura!\u201d Shen Moru wasn\u2019t afraid. His empty pupils were filled with resentment. \u201cI acknowledge the fact that you\u2019re really strong. As of now, it\u2019s probably hard to find anyone in this world that can be your match. However, you shouldn\u2019t forget where you are right now! Will you be able to endure the consequences of your identity becoming revealed!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s eyes were like frost and a trace of a cold smile was on his lips. \u201cShen Moru, do you think that I would return to Cerulean Mountain if I wasn\u2019t completely confident of making it out unscathed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fear flashed across Shen Moru\u2019s face. \u201cCould it be that you\u2019ve already found that item?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether I\u2019ve found it or not, you don\u2019t have the right to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you have, even if you\u2019ve already become the Saint Emperor, so what? You still wouldn\u2019t be able to save this woman! Baili Yu, with your cautious personality and skill in schemes, you probably never thought that there\u2019d be a day you\u2019d have to watch the woman you love die in front of you, right?\u201d Shen Moru laughed coldly. He then abruptly pulled off Tang Doudou\u2019s black robe and lifted her chin as if he wanted to give Baili Yu a better look.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, she actually hates you, because she already saw what happened between you and that woman earlier. You probably thought you had done everything covertly enough, right? But the truth was, she was also there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu furrowed his brows slightly. Was \u2018that woman\u2019 referring to Nangong Yan?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he recalled that figure. Understanding flashed through his eyes. That had been her?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you probably want to explain yourself, don\u2019t you? But apologies ah! When I caught her earlier, I already sealed all her senses. Right now, she can\u2019t hear or see anything. She\u2019s trapped in a pitch-black world to wallow in her hatred and resentment\u2026 In the end, she\u2019ll die without knowing why while hating you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Moru!\u201d Baili Yu shouted in rage as he lifted his hand and sent something harsh red flying towards Shen Moru.</p><br/><p>Shen Moru didn\u2019t try to dodge and just looked at him coldly.</p><br/><p>Just as that trace of red was about to hit him, he shifted Tang Doudou in front of himself and laughed loudly. \u201cNice ah! It really is wonderful! I\u2019ll undo the seal on her senses right now! I\u2019d like to see the expression on her face when she finds out that you were the one that killed her! I\u2019m really looking forward to it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The rage in Baili Yu\u2019s eyes flickered. His finger moved slightly and that red item immediately veered to the side to stab into a corpse next to Shen Moru. He spat out one word coldly, \u201cDespicable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I am despicable! But so what? It\u2019s even worth it to die now since I got to corner the prestigious Baili Yu this badly!\u201d As Shen Moru spoke, he reached out to stroke Tang Doudou\u2019s face. His tone was dark and sinister as he continued, \u201cMoreover, I have such a beauty to accompany me to my grave. It\u2019s worth it! It truly is worth it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s gaze darkened. Shen Moru must die!</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou was currently in his hands. Based on how vicious his personality was, he was probably serious about taking Tang Doudou with him to the grave.</p><br/><p>This person could no longer count as human anymore.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu retrieved the Blood Satan blade and said slowly, \u201cShen Moru, you\u2019re capturing her for her poison blood, aren\u2019t you? But compared to the poison blood from Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, you\u2019d probably find the poison blood from Hoarfrost Poison more interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoarfrost Poison?\u201d Surprise appeared in Shen Moru\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I possess it.\u201d Baili Yu looked at Shen Moru indifferently. \u201cSatisfied with this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! You\u2019re! You\u2026\u201d Shen Moru was extremely stirred up. Even the hand clutching Tang Doudou\u2019s neck was shaking.</p><br/><p>When Mu Ye heard the words \u2018Hoarfrost Poison,\u2019 he glanced at Baili Yu. There were no emotions visible in his eyes, but the iron chain in his hand was already starting to approach Shen Moru soundlessly like a snake.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change either. His skin that has always looked as beautiful as jade complemented by his red robes was starting to glow. \u201cWhat? You never thought of this, right? It never occured to you that I was still alive, much less that I\u2019m the child from back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

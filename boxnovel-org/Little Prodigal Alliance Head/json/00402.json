Everyone else was also looking at her weirdly. What was going on?</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling exhaled in relief when she saw that Tang Doudou had snapped out of it. She walked up and took the torch from Tang Doudou\u2019s hand to throw it into the large fire.</p><br/><p>She turned towards Tang Doudou helplessly and asked, \u201cSister-in-Law, what were you thinking about? They had called you several times but you didn\u2019t react at all. I was worried that something had happened to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it turned out that she had been too absorbed in her thoughts and missed what everyone had been saying.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I was just thinking that life was seriously too fragile!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling said with a smile, \u201cWhy\u2019s Sister-in-Law thinking about something like that when you\u2019re so young? Of course life is fragile, but isn\u2019t there that saying that scourges cause calamity for a thousand years? Don\u2019t worry, Sister-in-Law, people like us won\u2019t die so soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at Baili Yiling\u2019s bright flickering eyes. Why did this sound a little off?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, just leave the rest to us. This subordinate feels that you look exhausted. Why don\u2019t you hurry back to rest? There\u2019s still a lot of things you have to deal with. It\u2019d be bad if you ruined your health from not having enough rest!\u201d The friend of the deceased walked up and looked towards Tang Doudou worriedly.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt a bit of warmth in her heart when she heard these sincere words of concern. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s send these brothers off. The other matters can be pushed off a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling added, \u201cThis big brother, my sister-in-law is right. The decreased are more important. What\u2019s more important than sending these brothers on their way? Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s me to take care of Sister-in-Law. I won\u2019t let her health be affected!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw that both of them were adamant in staying here, he could only drop this suggestion.</p><br/><p>However, it\u2019d take quite a while for these bodies to burn.</p><br/><p>After standing next to the fire for a long while, the bright flames became scorching. Tang Doudou was just about to turn around and tell Yiling to move back a little when Little Gray screeched. She hastily pulled Yiling and moved away in a flash.</p><br/><p>An instant after she pulled Baili Yiling, eye-piercing flashes of blades cut through the pile of firewood that was originally surrounded by flames. The firewood collapsed and the flames started spreading rapidly. The moment Baili Yiling got over the shock, she moved in front of Tang Doudou protectively while backing towards the crowd.</p><br/><p>Someone shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s someone here to snatch the corpses!\u201d</p><br/><p>The situation immediately exploded. Tang Doudou knew that the mysterious person had definitely come again and she pushed Baili Yiling aside to say to the people of the four clans and the martial arts alliance, \u201cHe definitely won\u2019t be able to hide himself while carrying the corpses. Everyone, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The masters of the four large families truly weren\u2019t ordinary people. Right after she said this, Bai Luoqing took the lead and the rest of the family heads quickly followed. With a few leaps, they got to the pile of firewood and abruptly attacked. The light created by their inner strength mixed with the light from the flames and blocked the view of the battle for a moment.</p><br/><p>The master of the Murong family paused and turned towards Tang Doudou. \u201cAlliance Head, while we keep that person occupied, please take advantage of this chance to take him down with one blow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was stunned and inwardly cursed. With how weak her martial arts were, she\u2019d be crying Amitabha Buddha if she wasn\u2019t taken down in one shot. She was supposed to take someone else down in one go? Wasn\u2019t that walking up and asking for a beating?</p><br/><p>But how was she supposed to say this?</p><br/><p>All she could do was agree for the time being. After all, with the heads of the four families fighting and so many martial artists here, the mysterious person might be subdued before she even needed to do anything.</p><br/><p>This had been her original plan. However, before the first steps of the plan even started, this person had cornered her with this direct question.</p><br/><p>These thoughts flew rapidly through her head, then she answered, \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>The head of the Murong family finally went over to join the fight. Tang Doudou turned to the rest of the crowd and said, \u201cEveryone, let\u2019s work as one! We must take this evil criminal down today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head is right! Everyone, let\u2019s go! We can\u2019t let this evil criminal escape again!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd became stirred up after hearing Tang Doudou\u2019s words and rushed up all at once, making the scene a complete mess. The battle seemed to be going well. With so many skilled experts attacking, that mysterious person was on the verge of revealing himself. Tang Doudou was just about to rush up in order to take advantage of this chaos to try to see who that person was.</p><br/><p>However, Baili Yiling pulled her to a stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She turned around, only to find that Baili Yiling seemed very nervous.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling pointed at the mysterious person that everyone was attacking and whispered, \u201cSister-in-Law, hurry and think of a way to save him!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

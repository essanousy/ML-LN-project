She concentrated on directing Meng Yu to portion the dishes out and then had the maids separately carry them to each of the judges below the stage.</p><br/><p>All the other dishes had tasted dull and flavorless to the judges. This wouldn\u2019t normally be the case, but a Tang Doudou had ended up appearing today. They all wanted to taste what flavor a dish made with such a brilliant method would have so they couldn\u2019t summon much interest in eating other dishes. When they saw that it was almost Tang Doudou\u2019s turn, many people raised their heads to watch with anticipation, and some were even excited to the point they stood up.</p><br/><p>This scene made Bai Lianhua displeased again. She swept her gaze towards the restless Xi Qiuyue in front of her and her lips curled in a trace of a cold smile.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue had went \u2018crap\u2019 in his heart when Tang Doudou snatched Meng Yu\u2019s spatula earlier. Was she planning to do something to the dishes?</p><br/><p>Afterwards, he was also stunned by Tang Doudou\u2019s method of stir-frying. After the shock passed, he had to confront a choice.</p><br/><p>Should he expose Tang Doudou or pretend that he was unaware and then purposefully knock over the dishes she brought over?</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue was so conflicted ah.</p><br/><p>If it was just Tang Doudou by herself, he would still find it easy to deal with. What he was worried about was if Baili Yu was also involved in this.</p><br/><p>If he directly exposed her, he might be beaten up by them and might even force them to have a direct falling out. Who present was a match for Baili Yu\u2019s martial arts? Not to mention Li Xueyi was also not a pushover. No, no, that won\u2019t do\u2026</p><br/><p>But if he didn\u2019t expose her and His Majesty really ate that dish\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as Xi Qiuyue was conflicted over the decision and at a loss of where to place his hand, a person called out to him. \u201cYour Majesty, Sangfroid Prince, please sample\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, leave it there!\u201d Xi Qiuyue returned to his senses and looked at the little plate placed in front of him. Inside the plate was a non-vegetarian dish known as Squirrel Fish. The color and luster was bright and the fragrance tickled the gluttonous bug inside his stomach. Xi Qiuyue swallowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe five dishes of the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce has been presented. Everyone, please sample and evaluate!\u201d Manager Zhao glanced at San Yu who was following behind Tang Doudou and Meng Yu, then looked at Bai Yu who was sitting to the side. \u201cNext, Bai Residence, please prepare to present your dishes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, Sangfroid Prince, His Imperial Majesty is about eat that thing\u2026\u201d Bai Lianhua silently cursed when she saw Xi Qiuyue was still staring blankly at the food in front of him, then gave him a gentle reminder.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Xi Qiuyue hastily reacted and shot Bai Lianhua a grateful glance. He had almost forgotten the main crisis.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Xi Qiulin had his chopsticks lifted and was just about to taste the dish that the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce had cooked in such a new and original way. He was really curious about how it would taste so when he suddenly heard Xi Qiuyue cry out, he was a little displeased as he placed down his chopsticks.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way that he could say there\u2019s something wrong with that dish, right?</p><br/><p>How would it be any different from using his hand to slap Baili Yu\u2019s face?</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue thought for a bit, then said, \u201cBefore eating this dish, ben wang has a few questions to ask this lady of the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, his gaze landed on Tang Doudou, causing Tang Doudou to feel a bit baffled. She had already noticed while onstage that this guy was the poor devil, Xi Qiuyue, who she knocked unconscious that day in the martial arts convention. However, this was only the second time they had encountered each other and that day was pitch dark. In addition, he didn\u2019t show any reaction while she was cooking so she thought he didn\u2019t recognize her.</p><br/><p>Yet now, his eyes were filled with a warning expression, causing Tang Doudou to feel a little depressed. What did she do?</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t seem like she did anything?</p><br/><p>Why are the ancients so freaking hard to understand!?</p><br/><p>If it was the past, she would have just gone up and seized his ear before giving him a big freaking slap. If you like to eat then eat, if you don\u2019t like to eat then scram! This uncle is still waiting for the competition to finish so this uncle can go home and sleep!</p><br/><p>But rationality forced her to calm down. In the first place, the fact that Xi Qiuyue appeared here was already very strange. Wasn\u2019t it just a common cooking competition?</p><br/><p>Although it was said to be the Wind Spirit Imperial Court\u2019s annual culinary competition, from what she saw earlier, it wasn\u2019t anything that grand. At the very least, just based on the procedures it wasn\u2019t very impressive. This judging panel in the front row was of course a different matter.</p><br/><p>Earlier, during the time when they were waiting, Tang Doudou had noticed that regardless of whether it was Xi Qiuyue or anyone else, they were extremely respectful towards the man wearing a bright yellow robe in the very center. With the influences of many Mary Sue stories set in the ancient era, Tang Doudou understood very clearly that in the ancient era, normal people wouldn\u2019t dare to wear this type of nouveau riche bright yellow color. The only person was\u2026</p><br/><p>The Emperor!</p><br/><p>This person was the emperor of Wind Spirit Imperial Court?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s facial expression slightly changed and she looked worriedly towards Baili Yu. Damned evil spirit, you really dare to sit there!?</p><br/><p>He was sitting above the Emperor\u2019s position and was even doing it in such a happy and content way. Was he disdaining his life for being too long!?</p><br/><p>\u201cWonder if lady can clear up some of ben wang\u2019s questions?\u201d The Sangfroid Prince, Xi Qiuyue, saw that Tang Doudou was spacing out without a word and wondered what she was planning.</p><br/><p>Actually, Xi Qiuyue had a pretty good impression of Tang Doudou. It was just that the Imperial Court and the martial arts circles of Jianghu had always been incompatible as fire and water. It was fine when he was just the Common Person Wang; he had been free to drink and play with the people of the Jianghu. However, nowadays, His Majesty was considering bringing him back to the Imperial Court so he couldn\u2019t act so freely anymore, otherwise he\u2019ll hurt the Emperor\u2019s feelings. After all, they were uncle and nephew, they had to look out for each other.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue\u2019s repeated questioning caused everyone present to be confused. Could it be that this lady has some link with the Sangfroid Prince? Otherwise, why would he question her right here?</p><br/><p>Is there something that they couldn\u2019t discuss in private?</p><br/><p>Or was it that he had something he wanted His Majesty to set a decision forT/N?</p><br/><p>Or was it that he had an objection with this dish, or that he was curious about that method of cooking?</p><br/><p>Everyone made all sorts of conjectures, but some were pretty discontent. In reality, everyone had questions, but they all wanted to ask after eating this thing.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiulin thought the same, however, he was aware of his uncle\u2019s impatient nature. Thus, he said, \u201cThen let\u2019s just finish asking before tasting this delicacy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, San Yu\u2019s facial color changed slightly. She had calculated the time just right. She had planned for the dishes in front to be consumed first before she revealed that unusual dish at the perfect moment. If the time was delayed\u2026</p><br/><p>As she thought about it, she looked towards Tang Doudou who was spacing out. She couldn\u2019t help but shake her head. What did it matter if her style of stir-frying was good?</p><br/><p>What was important was still the taste of the food!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou retrieved her gaze and asked Xi Qiuyue in reply, \u201cWonder what comments wang ye has?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBen wang wishes to ask lady, what\u2019s your surname, what\u2019s your given name, where\u2019s your home, how many siblings are in your family?\u201d Xi Qiuyue thought that since he had already spoken this far, Li Xueyi would definitely understand what he meant. He was trying to make it so Li Xueyi would figure out the difficulty and retreat to avoid defeat rather than do something dumb\u2026</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue\u2019s words caused everyone to be stunned. This Sangfroid Prince really had that intention!?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs wang ye investigating registered residence?\u201d Tang Doudou, who was made speechless, blurted this out. Only after she finished speaking did she recall that the person in front of her was a wang ye. Though she was an Alliance Head, she was still just a common citizen. It would have been fine if only Xi Qiuyue was present, but the main problem was that there was an emperor here as well. So after she spoke, she hastily changed her tone. \u201cWhat I mean is, wonder what wang ye is asking about these things for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAudacious lowly person! You actually dared to use \u2018I\u2019 in front of wang ye!\u201d Right after she finished speaking, an angry female voice exploded. Tang Doudou looked towards Xi Qiuyue\u2019s side and saw a young girl about fifteen years old in a pink dress standing with her hand on her hip as she pointed towards her while shouting.</p><br/><p>Feels like she forgot to check the almanac before she headed out?</p><br/><p>Ever since she entered this Bai Residence, there\u2019s been an endless amount of people causing trouble for her. But she wasn\u2019t even familiar with them?</p><br/><p>Not to mention, she even changed disguises! What exactly did these people want?</p><br/><p>The young girl shouted again when Tang Doudou didn\u2019t speak. \u201cWhat are you spacing out over there for!? Wang ye is asking you a question. Hurry and reply!\u201d</p><br/><p>If you can\u2019t use \u2018I\u2019, then does that mean you have to use \u2018this servant\u2019?</p><br/><p>Fine, as she was under someone else\u2019s roof, she couldn\u2019t not lower her head!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at Xi Qiulin who was sitting right in the center. Suddenly, her expression rapidly changed and she cried out in a panic, \u201cWang ye, please spare my life ah, please spare me! This servant came from the countryside and doesn\u2019t know the customs. Hope wang ye da ren, being so magnanimous, won\u2019t hold this against this servant!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she even lost her head out of fear and ducked behind Meng Yu. Her little face was currently paler than white.</p><br/><p>Her acting was actually quite convincing. Baili Yu\u2019s eyes were half-closed, but he had been paying attention to Tang Doudou this entire time. When he saw her facial color change so quickly, he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. He felt quite interested in watching how she planned to deal with the rest of the events.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue was stunned a little stupid by her sudden transformation. \u201cLi\u2026 Li\u2026 don\u2019t worry, ben wang has no intention of blaming you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sighed in relief and patted her chest to calm lingering fears. Then she said, \u201cWang ye, you\u2019re such a good person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, she glanced at the young girl that had abruptly stood up and shrink backwards a little in fear. \u201cThat Miss is so scary!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLowly person, what nonsense are you saying!? See if I don\u2019t utterly destroy your mouth!\u201d That young girl was incomparably overbearing and directly stood up from her seat to walk forward.</p><br/><p>Bai Lianhua who was sitting next to her hastily reached out to pull her. \u201cLianyun\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLianhua jiejie, don\u2019t stop me. That lowly slave seriously don\u2019t know etiquette! This miss must give her a proper lesson! To let her know what etiquette means!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Lianhua continued to persuade her. \u201cThe Sangfroid Prince already said that it was fine. Also, that lady belongs to the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce, Baili gege will definitely find someone to teach her etiquette. You shouldn\u2019t get too angry over this, it\u2019s beneath your dignity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although this was what Bai Lianhua said, her eyes were filled with laughter. She had never liked this Bai Lianyun. Every since childhood, Bai Lianyun always felt herself of higher status than her and had given her quite a lot of attitude relying on the fact that her father was the current Prime Minister. Luckily, she was simple-minded. She only had to slightly instigate her and Bai Lianyun would move according to her plans.</p><br/><p>Earlier, she saw Xi Qiuyue stammer for half the day but still didn\u2019t get to the main point. In that confrontation, it had actually been Tang Doudou who was more aggressive, so she had pulled Bai Lianyun over to say a couple words. Then, Bai Lianyun immediately exploded and stood up without thinking to berate Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>As Bai Lianhua looked at Bai Yu and the Prime Minister\u2019s faces, she silently applauded the marvelous scene.</p><br/><p>To give birth to such a brainless girl, aiy\u2026</p><br/><p>As Bai Lianhua rejoiced in their misfortune, she pulled Bai Lianyun to sit back down. She thought that now that the topic has been opened, Xi Qiuyue should finally know what to do, right?</p><br/><p>The Imperial Court and the martial arts circles were existences that could not coexist. As long as Tang Doudou\u2019s true identity was revealed, based on a crime of unclear intentions, His Majesty definitely won\u2019t let him off!</p><br/><p>Baili gege was also someone of the Imperial Household. He definitely won\u2019t offend the Emperor just for a Tang Doudou. When that time comes, even if Tang Doudou manages to escape, there\u2019s no way the Emperor would allow a person charged with a crime to marry his Imperial Uncle.</p><br/><p>She had never expected to encounter His Majesty here this time. It must be known that His Majesty has never stepped out of the palace doors after he ascended the throne. Now that she had been able to run into him the moment he came out, didn\u2019t that mean she definitely had destiny with Baili gege?</p><br/><p>Bai Lianhua thought everything through happily. As she glanced at Bai Lianyun\u2019s angrily puffed up cheeks, she remarked in her heart: She wants to marry the Sangfroid Prince with this level of intelligence? She seriously overestimates her capabilities!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

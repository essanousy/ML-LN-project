Jun Xin hastily rolled to the side and got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you can move after I sealed your pressure points?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s eyes whirled, then he gave a dry cough. \u201cI was the one that taught you how to seal pressure points. There\u2019s no reason for the teacher to be sealed by his student, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glared at him. \u201cPei! So you didn\u2019t teach me a good method?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin just laughed. Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t stay angry at him with how he was acting. \u201cLittle brat, hurry up and undo the big evil spirit\u2019s seal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin nodded. \u201cOf course, but before I do that, let me check his pulse.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke in a serious manner, so Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he was suspicious of Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>But what was he suspicious of?</p><br/><p>This was definitely Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, her eyes lit up. Could it be that Jun Xin thought Baili Yu was faking amnesia?</p><br/><p>The only reason she thought of it so quickly was because she was a little suspicious as well.</p><br/><p>So she turned and asked Baili Yu, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let him take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu just glanced at her without saying anything.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Xin seemed to recall something and quickly ran over to strike a couple spots on Baili Yu\u2019s body before rapidly retreating again. When he saw that Tang Doudou seemed confused, he explained, \u201cI acted too fast earlier and accidently sealed his voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Tang Doudou didn\u2019t believe him at all. He had clearly sealed Baili Yu\u2019s voice on purpose so that he couldn\u2019t wake her up.</p><br/><p>After Baili Yu\u2019s voice was unsealed, he coughed before saying in a low voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to check.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t let me check, then I won\u2019t unseal your pressure points!\u201d The only thing Jun Xin was relying on was the fact that Baili Yu had lost his memories and his martial arts. Otherwise, in the past, no matter how fearless he was, in front of Baili Yu his tails would always be tucked between his legs.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced at him indifferently. His tone was calm to the point it chilled. \u201cI\u2019ll remember this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s heart jumped nervously, but he refused to admit defeat. \u201cSo what if you remember? Who\u2019s scared of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>A large sweatdrop slid down Tang Doudou\u2019s forehead. Baili Yu was clearly holding a grudge!</p><br/><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t be like this\u2026\u201d When she saw that the atmosphere was turning bad, she had no choice but to try and mediate them. \u201cLook, you guys grew up together like siblings. Just discuss things calmly, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Xin, you should stop making a fuss too over checking his pulse and stuff. We can just wait until we get back for a specialist to check. You\u2019ve said so yourself that you don\u2019t know much about medicine, what would you be able to find?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig evil spirit, you shouldn\u2019t be so petty either. Jun Xin\u2019s here to help us, and I owe him a lot. If it weren\u2019t for him, I would already be reporting to the King of Hell, so you shouldn\u2019t hold a grudge against him, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin yawned unhappily. \u201cFine, whatever you say. Humph\u2026 This little master doesn\u2019t want to deal with so many troublesome things either. I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>He walked towards the screen.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt pretty apologetic as well since Jun Xin seemed to really have gotten angry. However, Baili Yu\u2019s pressure points were still sealed!</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Xin.\u201d Although she hadn\u2019t wanted to call out to him, she still did.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll undo on its own after four hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows and looked towards Baili Yu helplessly. \u201cThen let\u2019s wait four hours? I\u2019ll carry you to the bed. It\u2019ll be more comfortable to lie down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou frowned. \u201cWe still need to travel later tonight. Don\u2019t push yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to wait four hours, it\u2019ll only take a little while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen alright, I\u2019ll believe you this once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind the screen, Jun Xin\u2019s eyes widened when he heard this. It\u2019ll only take a while? Was Baili Yu planning to break the seal on his own?</p><br/><p>But his martial arts?</p><br/><p>He shifted quietly to peek outside only for the scene of Baili Yu and Tang Doudou gazing passionately into each others\u2019 eyes to come into view. He hastily drew back and silently rebuked himself for being stupid enough as to torment himself. Why had he agreed to help her look for Baili Yu back then?</p><br/><p>He should have just kidnapped her.</p><br/><p>That way he wouldn\u2019t have to see them flirt all the time.</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes, vexed. What was the point of thinking about this? Once this matter was resolved, he\u2019ll have Baili Yu help him get back to Wind Cloud Island. Then once he settled the matter involving his parents, he\u2019ll start traveling the world and never deal with these messy things again.</p><br/><p>She too, he\u2019ll bury deep within his heart.</p><br/><p>He had to let go sooner or later.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu hadn\u2019t lied. After a short while, his body relaxed. He lifted his arm and stretched before sitting down on a nearby chair.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was excited, but then she glanced at Baili Yu weirdly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to ask me how I was able to undo it, right?\u201d Baili Yu glanced towards the screen. His voice contained mirth as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s because when he said that he was the one who taught you to seal pressure points, I suddenly remember that I was the one who taught him how to seal pressure points.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou burst out laughing. Her eyes darted towards the screen as well. \u201cIf Jun Xin was awake and heard this, he\u2019d definitely puke blood from anger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind the screen, Jun Xin had already closed his eyes. However, when he heard this exchange, his eyes abruptly shot open. He really did feel like puking blood. How had he forgotten this!?</p><br/><p>However, after Baili Yu said this, Jun Xin became even more certain in his conjecture. There was definitely something fishy with Baili Yu\u2019s claim of amnesia!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

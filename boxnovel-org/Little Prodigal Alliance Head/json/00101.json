On the contrary, a bamboo forest identical to the one earlier appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>Jesus ah! Who can explain to her what exactly was going on!?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was about to fall apart as she looked at the bamboo forest in front of her. She finally understood why Mu Ye didn\u2019t respond to her earlier question. It was completely because he thought she wouldn\u2019t believe him!</p><br/><p>Not only was there an array in the bamboo forest, the sea of flowers outside was also in the array. No wonder Mu Ye, even with his level of ability, would be trapped in here so many days.</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, if they don\u2019t find a way out she would also continue to be trapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first time I came, there was no array,\u201d Mu Ye said as he looked at her dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means that this array was set up recently?\u201d Tang Doudou tilted her head as she thought about it. \u201cI also never heard Baili Yu say that Azure Water Valley had any arrays. Before he left, he didn\u2019t warn me either. He just told me not to randomly run around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe probably thinks that you\u2019re more familiar with Azure Water Valley than anyone else.\u201d Mu Ye felt a little unexplainably uncomfortable when she brought up Baili Yu so he interrupted and broke off her incessant chatter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that possible, I\u2019ve never even\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou blurted out a refute. However, before she got through her sentence, she realized that Cang Baicao of Azure Water Valley was a subordinate of Cloud City. Li Xueyi also belonged to Cloud City. The two\u2019s territories were different but they both work for the Lord of Cloud City so Li Xueyi should be very familiar with Cang Baicao. Hence, this Azure Water Valley was probably a place Li Xueyi had often visited.</p><br/><p>After all, Li Xueyi had offended so many people on the Jianghu. This Azure Water Valley was an exceptionally good place to hide from murderous pursuers.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I really forgot how to get around.\u201d The words were at her lips, but Tang Doudou forcefully changed them while fending off Mu Ye\u2019s intimidating gaze.</p><br/><p>He had already felt she was strange since before.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if it was qinggong or martial arts. Even if one didn\u2019t use them for a long time, they were things that were engraved deep into one\u2019s bones. It was impossible to simply just forget about them.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, her nature and temper were extremely different from that of the rumors. With the exception of this identical face, he couldn\u2019t find a single similarity between this person in front of him and the Li Xueyi of the rumors.</p><br/><p>However, she really is that person. He had seen everything clearly in Rutaceae Pavilion.</p><br/><p>Even if she had changed into a female disguise, she was definitely the Li Xueyi he had seen back then.</p><br/><p>However, how can everything she forgot be explained?</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s probing gaze caused Tang Doudou to become on guard. Could it be this bro\u2019s suspecting her identity?</p><br/><p>No way, she can\u2019t allow him to be suspicious!</p><br/><p>Ever since Li Xueyi had completely disappeared, Tang Doudou started disliking this type of probing gaze with a particular passion. It was uncomfortable and felt if they wanted to peel off her skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve come, haha, let me think a little!\u201d Tang Doudou laughed, then diverged Mu Ye\u2019s attention. \u201cLet\u2019s go this way, it looks pretty familiar!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye didn\u2019t question her at all and started walking in that direction.</p><br/><p>However, she had just randomly pointed in a direction. Who knows if that direction would get them out? Why does Mu Ye trust her so much to the point that he walked in that direction without even thinking about it?</p><br/><p>What a solitary and independent man.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, wait for me!\u201d Tang Doudou energetically chased after him. After she left, the figure of the one-eyed woman appeared where they had been standing. As she looked at the two\u2019s back figures, she crackled with sinister laughter. Following that, she dispersed like smoke as if she had never appeared at all.</p><br/><p>They had walked for almost an hour in the direction Tang Doudou had randomly pointed in. Tang Doudou\u2019s feet were extremely sore. She was just about to suggest a break when she heard Mu Ye say, \u201cThere\u2019s a brook.\u201d</p><br/><p>These three words instantly invigorated Tang Doudou. She pulled Mu Ye and looked all around. \u201cBrook? Where\u2019s the brook?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSouthwest.\u201d</p><br/><p>How come the hearing ability of Mu Ye and the others are so much better than hers?</p><br/><p>As expected, it was the brook she had encountered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was at this brook that I encountered the old beggar and the one-eyed old woman before.\u201d After they walked along the brook a little while, they reached the area where Tang Doudou had grilled fish. Tang Doudou looked at the place she had walked here from and said to Mu Ye, \u201cWe should be able to get out if we walk that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve walked that way before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just walk it one more time!\u201d</p><br/><p>She moved up and patted Mu Ye\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said so, she dashed in that direction without waiting for Mu Ye\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>Meow ah. First things first, let\u2019s just get out of this damned place.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye must be in a good mood these last couple days. Not only did he teach her qinggong, he even praised her. However, this didn\u2019t mean that the two of them could continue to coexist peacefully this way. After all, she was the Alliance Head and he was the leader of the Demonic Sect. It was foreordained that they couldn\u2019t become friends that sat together peacefully while drinking tea and chatting.</p><br/><p>The person she should find was Baili Yu. She should stay as far away from Mu Ye as possible.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou went extremely fast. Mu Ye\u2019s qinggong wasn\u2019t as good as hers to he soon lost sight of her.</p><br/><p>He searched repeatedly through the sea of flowers. After finally confirming that she had left alone, he returned to the small brook once again. His deep eyes were even colder than before. She left without even saying a goodbye.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s sure heartless enough.</p><br/><p>Then, he laughed at himself coldly. Since that time at the Alliance Head Residence, he no longer felt like killing her. He never thought\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know if the array had stopped working or if she was really starting to run into expected dogshit luck but she actually returned to the original road after walking a while. As Tang Doudou gazed at the carriage that was parked not far away, she felt the urge to rush up and kiss it a couple times.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou got into the carriage and tidied up her clothing. After eating a little, she started staring at the path outside, bored. Why was Baili Yu still not coming out?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he wasn\u2019t worried about her at all?</p><br/><p>He\u2019s really not worried that she\u2019ll get lost?</p><br/><p>Haa\u2026</p><br/><p>Before she had realized it, she was starting to think of Baili Yu every time she encountered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Xueyi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she was wondering what Baili Yu was doing right now, Su Yi\u2019s voice came from outside the carriage.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The only thing she harped on about everyday was the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance.</p><br/><p>Suddenly having this thrown at her, she really didn\u2019t quite know which cloud it was.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin saw that Tang Doudou was completely at a loss and her heart sank. Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, as someone serving at Master\u2019s side she had long heard of this type of poison and was very clear as to its toxicity and effects. Among them, the most mysterious and unsurpassable effect was the fact that it could wipe away memories.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but feel sad for Tang Doudou. Right now she was only forgetting some little things, but in the future, she might not even be able to remember things that had happened just a second before. To Qing Yin, it seemed that this would be extremely painful to bear ah!</p><br/><p>Even though she thought this, Qing Yin was also helpless. She couldn\u2019t even go to beg Master so as to avoid overreaching herself and angering Master.</p><br/><p>\u201cJianghu only has one Alliance Head Residence, and that\u2019s precisely Li gongzi, your home ah!\u201d Since she has forgotten, what harm is there for Qing Yin to remind her again?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy home?\u201d Tang Doudou rolled her eyes, finally remember what the Alliance Head Residence was. After several leisurely days, she really ended up forgetting that she was still occupying the position of an Alliance Head.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was it that came? They\u2019re here to take me back?\u201d Tang Doudou asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin shook her head and replied: \u201cThis servant doesn\u2019t know either. This servant only knows that Bai gongzi isn\u2019t within the group of people that came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Which basically means that it\u2019s very unlikely that they\u2019re here to take her back. It was likely that they were here to pick faults ah!</p><br/><p>Thinking to here, Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes narrowed. Perfect timing! She just happened to be bored out of her mind so she\u2019ll go see what these guys are up to!</p><br/><p>She really hoped Elder Yu came. Everytime she sees the way his beard flares up due to anger, she would feel exceptionally delighted ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you in the Guest Hall. Master said to have you deal with it as quickly as possible, otherwise he\u2019ll be chasing them away soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei! Hearing this, Tang Doudou gave a large eyeroll. Humph, what a great Baili Yu. His face is seriously as big as a plate ah(very bold/unafraid). To take other people\u2019s Alliance Head and keep him under house arrest in his own home. And now that the people from that side came over, if they stayed too long Baili Yu actually even threatens to chase them away? Isn\u2019t that arrogance too unbridled!?</p><br/><p>Qing Yin saw that she seemed faintly infuriated and hurriedly pulled her, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Li gongzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Qing Yin leading, they twisted and turned around the large garden for quite a while before they finally managed to arrive at what Qing Yin called the Guest Hall. Before they even got close, they could already hear an extremely resentful voice, \u201cAlliance Head is just hanging around here. After staying here for seven, eight days he still hasn\u2019t gone back to take charge of the general situation. Isn\u2019t this too unreasonable!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Another voice used that as a pretext, \u201cExactly! This time, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Bai gongzi got trapped, Elder Yu still wouldn\u2019t let us come find him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was trapped? Trapped where? Hearing this, Tang Doudou\u2019s steps sped up and in a few breaths she had reached the Guest Hall.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin naturally followed closely behind.</p><br/><p>They were still discussing in the Guest Hall when suddenly they saw a white-clothed young man appear at the entrance. His facial features were delicate and pretty, glowing with health and vigor and showing a strong self-confidence.</p><br/><p>Immediately someone called: \u201cIt\u2019s the Alliance Head, he\u2019s arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of people rose up from their seats in quick succession and called in chorus. Only one person continued sitting without even moving.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s clear as water eyes swept past all the people in front of her. Her heart was very depressed, she didn\u2019t even recognize a single one of them ah.</p><br/><p>But this didn\u2019t matter, as long as they recognized her, it was enough.</p><br/><p>As she thought, she gave a light \u2018en\u2019 as a reply then entered the Guest Hall with a tranquil expression. She asked with a mild tone: \u201cWhat seek ye, sirs? Just now I heard that Bai gongzi had been trapped, what brought that about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, so you\u2019ve finally come out.\u201d The person that didn\u2019t move at all coldly spoke. That voice was precisely the first voice she had heard when she was outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cSyndicate Leader Xu, you should speak a little less. Alliance Head was only forced to stay here a few extra days due to his injuries, what\u2019s more\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That sentence wasn\u2019t even finished before someone faintly said: \u201cI\u2019m merely afraid that Alliance Head has been passing the days too comfortably and has long since forgotten his commitment to us brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke he cast his gaze towards Qing Yin.</p><br/><p>The unspoken meaning was clear.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou coldly smiled in her heart but showed puzzlement on the surface, \u201cYou guys came to find me today for the sake of complaining? If it\u2019s really like that, then you guys can just head back. I\u2019ll look for someone else to ask about what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of those who spoke just now immediately turned rigid. They didn\u2019t expect that Tang Doudou would be this direct.</p><br/><p>After a brief period of silence, one of the anxious people immediately spoke, \u201cReplying Alliance Head\u2019s words, Bai gongzi and the Murong family were trapped in Qishan by the Demonic Sect as they were on their way to Cloud Sun City! The situation is dire. Elder Yu could not think of a solution which is why he had us come find you!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were going back to Cloud Sun City? Could it be that Bai Feiyun already resolved that matter?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened, first give me a clearer explanation. Why would Bai gongzi be heading to Cloud Sun City with the Murong family? And what happened with the Demonic Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>That person spoke again: \u201cThe Murong family came to the Alliance Head Residence to cause a ruckus several times. Bai gongzi was busy to the point he was badly burned about the head (from trying to put out a fire, metaphoric proverb) as he had to deal with the Murong family and also, handle the large and small matters of the Martial Arts Circles in your, Alliance Head\u2019s, place. For the sake of finding doubtful points in their story to prove Alliance Head\u2019s innocence, Bai gongzi and the Murong family constantly rushed about between Huai City and Cloud Sun City. This time, after hearing that a witness who was at the scene was found in Cloud Sun City, Bai gongzi rushed there without stopping to rest, but unexpectedly half way there he ended up encountering people from the Demonic Sect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He actually did that that much for her sake\u2026 Tang Doudou was very moved. Bai Feiyun ah, Bai Feiyun. She, Doudou, really owes you a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would the Demonic Sect trap Bai Feiyun?\u201d Could it be that they had some bad history?</p><br/><p>That person also didn\u2019t know, \u201cIt\u2019s also strange for the Demonic Sect. According to the normal course of events, the Demonic Sect should have no way of knowing Bai gongzi\u2019s whereabouts. After all, even though they had been active in the Martial Arts Circles, they had never dared to enter Huai City\u2019s region\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke he looked towards Qing Yin. The meaning was obvious, because in Huai City there\u2019s Baili Yu ah. As unbridled as the Demonic Sect is, they still don\u2019t dare to provoke Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was curious now. Why exactly were the Imperial Family, the Martial Arts Circles, and the Demonic Sect all afraid of Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s even more strange is that Bai gongzi\u2019s qing gong can be said to be unrivaled. His martial arts are also not bad. So unless it was Mu Ye that had personally acted, there was no one in the Demonic Sect that had a chance of defeating Bai gongzi. But as for blocking him, it also wouldn\u2019t be an easy matter.\u201d That person sighed, completely not understanding how this could have happened.</p><br/><p> \u2013 \u201cQing gong\u201d is a sort of martial arts, the \u2018light\u2019 martial arts. People can walk on water and on air with this.</p><br/><p>But Tang Doudou understood it very clearly. How\u2019d the Demonic Sect know Bai Feiyun\u2019s whereabouts? There\u2019s no other possible explanation but that there\u2019s a traitor!</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, when this news came no one was this worried. After all, we all believed that Bai gongzi had the ability to escape. But against all reason, this morning someone brought a message. It said that if we wished for Bai Feiyun to be alive, then we must bring one thing over to exchange for his life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this means that Bai Feiyun has already been captured by the Demonic Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Da fudge, he\u2019s already captured and you\u2019re still saying trapped! Trapped your damned uncle ah!E/N</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s balls hurtedE/N2 dreadfully but her expression was still calm as before, \u201cWhat do they want?\u201d</p><br/><p>This thing is definitely nothing simple and even has a big connection to her. Otherwise these guys wouldn\u2019t have come here to look for her.</p><br/><p>And to have even been sent here by Elder Yu.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou narrowed her eyes, remarking in her heart that this matter was probably far from unrelated with that old guy. Hey, last time Bai Feiyun was still saying that he wouldn\u2019t make any moves for the time being but he\u2019s already made a move. Looks like he had also gotten impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on the news that arrived today, Bai gongzi has already been captured!\u201d As he spoke he suddenly started bawling, \u201cAlliance Head ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was shocked to the point that her brows leapt up. What drama is he acting from this time?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must save Bai gongzi ah! During this period of time while you were gone, all the little and big matters of the Martial Arts Circles were handled and dealt with by Bai gongzi! Bai gongzi is a good person ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou naturally knew that Bai Feiyun was a good person. But, what\u2019s he mean? Why\u2019s it sound like she wouldn\u2019t save Bai Feiyun?</p><br/><p>Why\u2019d he believe that so firmly?</p><br/><p>Unless it\u2019s related to that item?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt like her estimate wasn\u2019t far off the mark and asked: \u201cAlright, stop crying. Regarding this matter this Alliance Head naturally has kept it in mind. You only need to tell me what exactly is it that they want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, all the people in the Guest Hall closed their mouths as if it was coordinated.</p><br/><p>Angering Tang Doudou to the point she nearly flipped out.</p><br/><p>Really wish she could just gift each person an Ascending Sky Monkey and send them all to heaven!E/N3</p><br/><p>Meow a cat ah! To be blotted with ink at this crucial moment, it\u2019s practically angering Beanbeans to death!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Because she was worried about Bai Feiyun, Tang Doudou could only calm the anger in her heart and restrain her temper as she asked once more: \u201cYou guys can be at ease. The contributions Bai gongzi has made for this Alliance Head, for all the Martial Arts Circles, this Alliance Head knows clearly. Even though I have always been here nursing my injuries, but I\u2019ve also been paying attention to the situation outside. I am very well aware of how Bai gongzi has toiled and done many meritorious deeds. Even if that Demonic Sect wants the life of this Alliance Head, what would it matter? As long as it can save Bai gongzi, if it must be given up, then just let it be given up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Quite a few people became emotionally moved hearing this. They just knew that the Alliance Head wasn\u2019t someone that would forget favors and violate justice. Look at the way he put it, even willing to give up his life, so what would a trifling material object matter?</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Qing Yin really wanted to laugh. Even though she wasn\u2019t at Tang Doudou\u2019s side everyday, but she had heard quite a bit about him from others. Which day had he not slept until the sun was three bamboo sticks high? He spent his days so leisurely that he was almost about to drive himself mad from boredom, and he still had the mind to pay attention to the situation outside? Just then when she brought the Alliance Head Residence, he didn\u2019t know who or even remember what place is was.</p><br/><p>But she was just a maid. It isn\u2019t her place to judge what the Masters want to do\u2026 She can only lower her eyes and quietly wait at their side. In reality, like this was enough.</p><br/><p>Seeing that this group of people still weren\u2019t talking, Tang Doudou slapped the table with a thump and roared: \u201cWhat are you all still dazing out for!? Don\u2019t you know that time is tight!? If something really happens to Bai gongzi, can you guys afford to take responsibility? Acting so fainthearted and old-womanish, do you guys really want to cause Bai gongzi to die!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was thinking about their respective matters when she had suddenly slammed the table and roared. Seeing her furious yet imposing manner, they were shocked to the point they froze. When this Alliance Head bursts into rage he\u2019s actually pretty intimidating.</p><br/><p>\u201cReplying Alliance Head, the Demonic Sect said that as long as we hand the Alliance Head Command Tablet over, they will release Bai gongzi.\u201d That person clenched his teeth and finally said it.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the Alliance Head Command Tablet again!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou really wanted to flip the table. Da fudge, if she still couldn\u2019t guess the connection between all of this she should just go grab a brick of tofu and knock herself to death.E/N4</p><br/><p>This matter is definitely related to Elder Yu!</p><br/><p>But soon enough she felt awkward as well. If the Alliance Head Command Tablet was with her, she definitely would have taken it out without a word to trade for Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>To her, the Alliance Head Command Tablet was just a completely useless tablet, but Bai Feiyun was a completely different case!</p><br/><p>However, right now, the Alliance Head Command Tablet is still in Baili Yu\u2019s hands. If she went to get it, would he give it to her? This was really a troublesome matter.</p><br/><p>If he was planning to give it to her\u2013she had already be here for so long\u2013he would have already given it to her long ago.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t plan to give it to her, what is he keeping it for?</p><br/><p>How could she have enough insight to perceive what Baili Yu\u2019s hidden intentions are? She was currently becoming depressed when the guy that had been constantly nitpicking earlier started to sarcastically speak again, \u201cFor Alliance Head to hesitate this long, it looks like you can\u2019t bear to part with it? Just then Alliance Head spoke with so much devotion to righteousness that it inspired reverence, could it be it was all just empty words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Da fudge, where did this Dou Bi* pop out from?</p><br/><p>The term Dou Bi is in the glossary about a person that loves competing but in the end lost a competition because he got scared by the cold. In application to this scenario, Tang Doudou\u2019s remarking that he sure loves to compete but he\u2019s bound to lose.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by Scullyhahn</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>E/N \u2013 In this case, aren\u2019t trapped and captured the same thing? I don\u2019t understand her frustration.</p><br/><p>C: I believe trapped usually means cornered or endangered somewhere. Captured means the enemy has successfully subdued them and brought them back to their base.</p><br/><p>E/N2 \u2013 So strange. Wow. Why?

Still under his guidance, the soft handkerchief was pressed against Tang Doudou\u2019s nose, finally putting the non-stop nosebleed under control.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was very surprised. She never imagined that Baili Yu would help her wipe her nosebleed. However, immediately afterward, she felt that she was too naive. The fact that he helped her stop her nosebleed, wasn\u2019t it just because he didn\u2019t want the nosebleed to continue dripping onto his hand!?</p><br/><p>And because of that damned mysophobia, he even insisted on borrowing her hand to pick up that handkerchief! That\u2019s seriously too much ah!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s nose was wiped by Baili Yu\u2019s merciless back and forth strokes. He wiped back and forth, wishing he could just wipe off Tang Doudou\u2019s entire face. Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes were brimming with tears from the pain as she continuously cried, \u201cBaili Yu! Don\u2019t, don\u2019t wipe there ah! It hurts, oww! I\u2019ll wipe(Shit)T/N! The skin\u2019s about to peel off ah! Don\u2019t ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But how could Baili Yu possibly care about that much? After grasping her hand, his movements were fast as flying: up, down, left, right. It was very brisk and cheerful. His elegant eyes were narrowed slightly as he watched her eyes fill with tears from the pain. Looking at her pitiful appearance as she continuously cried out from the pain, an indescribable feeling of carefree delight floated up. The earlier anger seemed to have instantaneously disappeared.</p><br/><p>Dare her to make spicy strips that were so spicy that he couldn\u2019t get off the bed for days, dare her to have a nosebleed over his entire hand\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Lianhua who was standing in front of them gritted her teeth before relaxing, but after relaxing, she couldn\u2019t help but grit her teeth again. This Li Xueyi was seducing Baili gege like this as if no one was around, his behavior was too bullying!</p><br/><p>If it was a woman, it could have been dismissed, but a man actually also wanted to try dipping a finger in Baili gege\u2019s pie? It was seriously too shameless and vulgar!</p><br/><p>At the same time, feelings of grievances also flooded her heart. She had known Jun Xin since childhood and due to that, in addition to their families\u2019 relationship, her relationship with Jun Xin was still very good after she grew up. Because Jun Xin was older than her and often left home to make his way in the world outside, Bai Lianhua would often pester Jun Xin to tell her about all the odd people and strange events of the Jianghu. After all, although Bai Lianhua practiced martial arts, she had never left home to wander on the Jianghu before. And in their talks, the person Jun Xin mentioned the most was Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin would talk about in how Baili Yu was exceptional in so and so ways. For example, that from a young age he had amassed a fortune that would only grow without end. Even the imperial household revered him so there were even fewer people in the Jianghu that would dare to anger him. What was even more important was that he was even the current most beautiful man under heaven. It\u2019s said that even flowers would voluntarily bloom if he bestowed them a glance and fishes would faint from happiness simply from the opportunity to exchange a word with him.</p><br/><p>As the young sproutling that she was, she naturally could not resist the fascination of this rumored man. All day long, she couldn\u2019t think of anything else except daydreaming about seeing Baili Yu once and witnessing for herself if what Jun Xin said was true.</p><br/><p>Afterward, with just one look, she was directly toppled by Baili Yu\u2019s unsurpassable magnificence. Ever since then, she was so deeply infatuated she couldn\u2019t pull herself out.</p><br/><p>Like a good number of women who admired Baili Yu, she tried to perfect herself as if her life depended on it. She used all her strength to improve herself for a day when she could be good enough to stand at Baili Yu\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>But unlike other women, she knew Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin and Baili Yu\u2019s relationship was a complicated affair, and it can only be said that it was difficult to explain in a few words. They were like teachers that were friends, but also like friends that were enemies. In any case, their bond was deep. Hence, with Jun Xin\u2019s help, she was finally able to establish a link with Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>But sadly, even though they had a link, Baili Yu has never looked straight at her before. Not to even mention the fact that every time she came, he would find an excuse to avoid her. Even if they encountered each other, he would think of ways to get Jun Xin to come over and subtly kick her out.</p><br/><p>Every time she went back she would also cry from the deep heartbreak, but after crying she still couldn\u2019t let it go.</p><br/><p>As her eyes faced forward blankly, all these memoriesflashed past. Unknowingly, so many years had already passed, and she was now sixteen. If she couldn\u2019t capture Baili Yu\u2019s heart soon, her family would be arranging a different marriage for her.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she came this time with a surefire preparation, all for the sake of capturing Baili Yu in one move. Yet a Li Xueyi just had to emerge out of nowhere. Putting aside the fact that he was tangling with Jun Xin, he actually even dipped a finger in her Baili gege!</p><br/><p>It must be known that the reason she had never given up on Baili Yu was because he had never been touched by female charms. It had been so many years, yet there has never been a single woman at his side before. This was what gave her power to keep hoping.</p><br/><p>But at present, the Baili Yu that had been aloof to all female charms before was actually being this intimate with a man. Ignoring the fact that they were hugging in public in front of so many eyes, Baili gege actually openly teased Li Xueyi in response to Li Xueyi\u2019s provocation.</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t dare to imagine what kind of seductive techniques Li Xueyi would use to muddle Baili gege when there was no one around!</p><br/><p>The image of Baili Yu and Li Xueyi on a bed together continuously appeared in Bai Lianhua\u2019s mind and she was infuriated to the point that her nails dug into her flesh. Her gaze, which was constantly aimed at Li Xueyi, was practically about to become knives, bestowing upon Tang Doudou the death of a thousand cuts(old type of capital punishment, used figuratively).</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou, however, never felt that gaze because her nose was being rubbed to the point that it almost wasn\u2019t her own anymore. At this moment, she only had one thought: the moment Baili Yu unseals her acupuncture point she must bite him to death! With the type of bite that doesn\u2019t carry any ambiguous meanings!</p><br/><p>But Baili Yu noticed Bai Lianhua\u2019s concentrated resentment. His brows knitted slightly as he lifted his eyes to look towards Bai Lianhua.</p><br/><p>Bai Lianhua was still in her own world of resentment, but when Baili Yu\u2019s gaze swept over, the numerous years of habit allowed her to immediately notice. She hurriedly repressed that expression of resentment and instead exposed an expression of anxiety. As she watched Tang Doudou cry out painfully, she wrung the hem of her garment, giving off an appearance of wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><br/><p>But these pretenses of hers practically didn\u2019t exist in Baili Yu\u2019s eyes as he saw straight through her to the resentment in her heart. Baili Yu slowly hooked up his dark red lips; his motive has been achieved at last.</p><br/><p>To give a direct punishment in retaliation was not his style. Baili Yu just loved slowly and painfully tormenting people like this.</p><br/><p>Li Xueyi has been marked by Bai Lianhua now. Based on the methods Bai Lianhua had been using these past years to deal with those women, the things that happened today will be enough to make him suffer in the near future. It\u2019s best if Li Xueyi remembers well and properly that he, Baili Yu, was not someone that was this easy to scheme about.</p><br/><p>Recalling those spicy strips that Tang Doudou made, Baili Yu\u2019s mood started getting gloomy again. That day, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that his reaction was quick, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep that title of the most beautiful man under the heavens anymore.</p><br/><p>Never had it been found out that the reason he doesn\u2019t eat hot peppers isn\u2019t because he\u2019s afraid of spicy things but rather because\u2026</p><br/><p>His eyes lowered slightly as out of the corners of his eyes, his gaze just happened to sweep across the hourglass that had just finished trickling its last grain of sand. And so, his hand stopped.</p><br/><p>Phew! He\u2019s finally tired ah!</p><br/><p>Feeling him stop, Tang Doudou exhaled a breath of relief. Her heart was unbearably uncomfortable. Just the fact that he was rubbing her nose was enough, but he would even anticipate the moments when she was about to sneeze and reach over to cover her nose every single time just as it was about to come out. It had been choked back so much that Tang Doudou\u2019s egg(face) was about to crack from the force of that held back sneeze. This was practically abuse ah!</p><br/><p>This was too much! Tang Doudou really wanted to reach over to rub her poor nose, but she couldn\u2019t move at all. She could only look at Baili Yu with teary eyes and denounce his inhuman behavior!</p><br/><p>Actually, she really wanted to curse at him, but she was also afraid that Baili Yu would come up with some other ways to torment her, so she could only shut her mouth. Instead, she resorted to cursing Baili Yu\u2019s top top, down down, left left, and right right a complete round silently in her mind.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu loosened his hand and Tang Doudou\u2019s hand fell simultaneously with that bloodstained handkerchief. Tang Doudou\u2019s nose was exposed, red as a tomato and swollen to the point that it was almost glowing.</p><br/><p>He turned the ornamental thumb ring on his hand. It seems he acted a little too heavily ah!</p><br/><p>Meeting with Tang Doudou\u2019s tear-filled eyes, Baili Yu uncomfortably shifted his gaze away. Cough, how come he seem to feel some guilt? He should have Ye Chuan send some medicine over for her after all. It\u2019s about time, he should chase them out now!</p><br/><p>Reaching out to get a pure white handkerchief from behind the soft fur, Baili Yu gracefully wiped clean the bloodstains on his hand. As his gaze swept across the bits of black inside those bloodstains, a vague trace of sadness flashed past his face. When he lifted his eyes again, Baili Yu disdainfully threw the handkerchief on the ground, giving a pair to that pink handkerchief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Chuan.\u201d He called quietly.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan, who was standing at the door still had his soul currently wandering in the skies. He was just thinking about how exactly this event would end today when Baili Yu\u2019s voice arrived at his ears. With a quiver, he quickly responded, \u201cThis subordinate is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSend Alliance Head Li back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026It was this simple?</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan was very astonished, but nevertheless, his reaction was still very quick. Right after Baili Yu\u2019s words fell, he walked up. Only after walking closer was he able to see Tang Doudou\u2019s swollen red nose clearly. He almost wasn\u2019t able to hold back his laughter. It looked like it wasn\u2019t that simple after all ah, Master sure didn\u2019t go gentle!</p><br/><p>Seeing him head over, Baili Yu\u2019s dark red lips parted slightly and a languid and charming voice slowly spilled out, \u201cAlliance Head Li, I\u2019m only lending that item to you. After you finish using it, you must remember to return it oh. Otherwise, if this one has to go to the Residence to ask for it back, this one is afraid it\u2019ll cause Alliance Head Li quite a bit of trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that she could finally leave, Tang Doudou\u2019s tears fell with \u2018plop plop plop\u2019s. Never will she ever come to find Baili Yu, this big devil, again!</p><br/><p>But her acupuncture points still haven\u2019t been unsealed ah! How does he expect her to leave like this?</p><br/><p>At this instant, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t have the mind to mull over the meanings within Baili Yu\u2019s words. All she wanted was to leave this place as soon as possible, so she immediately gritted her teeth and said, \u201cI got it. I\u2019ll have to trouble Baili gongzi to help unseal my acupuncture points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the matter you agreed to earlier, Alliance Head Li shouldn\u2019t forget about that either.\u201d Baili Yu propped his head up with one hand and slightly narrowed his eyes, almost as if he were about to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I agree to earlier? Baili gongzi, you probably remembered wrong? I didn\u2019t promise you anything!\u201d Hell, wasn\u2019t all that stuff earlier things he decided on his own to anger Jun Xin? What did that have to do with her!?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Baili Yu completely closed his eyes with a leisurely expression. \u201cThen Alliance Head doesn\u2019t want to admit it? Since it\u2019s like this, then this one can only take back the item.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d She finally got back the Alliance Head Command Tablet after so much trouble, if it was taken back again, what was she supposed to bring over to rescue Bai Feiyun?</p><br/><p>But then, Tang Doudou soon realized a problem. When she had just arrived, didn\u2019t Baili Yu say that this wasn\u2019t the Alliance Head Command Tablet? Yet he\u2019s giving it to her again now, could it be he was trying to fool her?</p><br/><p>As she thought that, she immediately questioned with the bold confidence of having justice on her side, \u201cI don\u2019t even know whether that thing is truly real or not! If it turns out you took out a fake item to swindle me and I can\u2019t rescue Bai Feiyun back, who am I supposed to cry to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t open his eyes. His long eyelashes cast a sweeping shadow as his mouth unhurriedly formed the words, \u201cIf my memory is correct, Miss Bai and Bai gongzi are cousins?\u201d</p><br/><p>She never expected that Baili Yu would voluntarily mention her name. This was something that had never happened before ah!</p><br/><p>Bai Lianhua\u2019s heart was extremely excited, but on the surface, she adopted a sincere and easy-mannered expression as she exposed the charming attitude of a little girl, \u201cBaili gege\u2019s memory is truly good. Lianhua\u2019s paternal aunt is White Wind Manor\u2019s Madam Yunchang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The capture of Bai Feiyun by the Demonic Sect was a matter that the entire Jianghu knew of. The reason she came this time was also because Auntie Yunchang asked her to find Jun Xin for help.</p><br/><p>But her head was filled with thoughts of Baili Yu so she had completely thrown this matter to the back of her mind. Right now, only after the matter was brought up by Tang Doudou and Baili Yu did she recall this matter. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t care enough about her cousin, but because she felt this matter wasn\u2019t that serious. No matter how arrogant the Demonic Sect was, they would still have to properly think things over before touching Bai Feiyun. It must be known that Bai Feiyun\u2019s relationship with the Lord of Cloud City was quite deep. To make a move against Bai Feiyun was equal to having an acrimonious falling out with Cloud City. Even though the development of the Demonic Sect had been quite strong these recent years, its overall strength was nevertheless still weak. Its strength was absolutely not enough to have a confrontation against a huge monster-like existence like Cloud City.</p><br/><p>At most, they were just using Bai Feiyun to purposefully embarrass this recently appointed Alliance Head.</p><br/><p>Thinking of the fact that it could embarrass Li Xueyi, Bai Lianhua\u2019s thoughts sprung to life. Perhaps she could use this opportunity to completely weed out Li Xueyi by the roots from Baili Yu\u2019s side!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His voice was a little hoarse, probably due to practicing mimicry.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was currently holding a bowl of porridge that a servant had brought. He had tried for a while, but couldn\u2019t get Tang Doudou to open her mouth. When he saw that Jun Xin had returned, he loosened a breath in relief. \u201cYoung Master Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin noticed the untouched bowl of porridge Bai Feiyun was holding and asked, \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but Alliance Head refuses to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me try.\u201d Jun Xin took the bowl from his hand and smiled towards Tang Doudou, who was currently propped up into a sitting position. His handsome face filled with gentleness as he said, \u201cStinkin\u2019 woman, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun lowered his eyes and turned to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ah, even like this you still cause trouble and insist on waiting until this young master comes back to eat. I\u2019m telling you! I\u2019ll be charging you for this service!</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I know that you\u2019re poor.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve thought up a plan. Right now, this young master is working like a horse to look after you. So once you wake up, cook for me everyday in order to pay me back, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s voice was hoarse but he still continued to chatter nonstop. After a while, Tang Doudou, who had been refusing to eat, opened her eyes slightly.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was so stirred up that he almost dropped the bowl. His hands trembled, and his voice did so as well. \u201cDoudou? A-are, are you awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it was false hope. Tang Doudou only opened her eyes briefly before closing them again. After a few moments, there was the sound of even breathing.</p><br/><p>She had fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin heaved a sigh and placed the bowl to the side before helping her lie down and tucking the blanket in around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi, what exactly is the method you were talking about? Can you tell me now?\u201d Jun Xin strode out with large steps and impatiently grabbed Bai Feiyun to press him for answers. \u201cShe\u2019s not willing to open her mouth. Is her condition already starting to get worse?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the looks of it, she is getting worse.\u201d When Bai Feiyun heard that he hadn\u2019t been able to convince Tang Doudou to eat the porridge, a trace of relief actually appeared in his eyes. He casually avoided Jun Xin\u2019s grasp and said, \u201cYoung Master Jun has probably guessed the method I was about to propose, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was silent for a few moments. \u201cAre we really going to do this? Wake her up with Baili Yu\u2019s voice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Young Master Jun have a better idea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but after she wakes up, if she can\u2019t find Baili Yu, wouldn\u2019t she fall into the same state again?\u201d This was something Jun Xin was really worried about, but he was even more worried that Tang Doudou would hold a grudge against him.</p><br/><p>She had once said that she hated being deceived the most.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for Young Master Jun to worry, a semi-comatose state isn\u2019t something you can end up in at will. As long as she wakes up, Feiyun is ninety percent confident in helping her recover completely. However\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to count on you for the events that follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Jun Xin furrowed his brows. He then glanced up at the sky. The moon was currently covered by dense clouds. It was probably going to storm tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun said, \u201cOnce Alliance Head wakes up, someone must stay by her side at all times to watch over her just in case she falls into depression again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Jun Xin smiled. \u201cFrom now on, I won\u2019t ever let her out of my sight again. There\u2019s no need for Bai gongzi to worry about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeiyun is relieved to hear that. We can\u2019t rush in the process of waking her up, so starting now, Young Master Jun, you should do your best to mimic several voices. It\u2019s best if they\u2019re all good friends of the Alliance Head. Then gradually make it so that Alliance Head is convinced that Baili gongzi has come back and is waiting for her to wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will take my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Bai Feiyun left, Jun Xin stood in the courtyard by himself for a good while.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan came out from the shadows. \u201cYoung Master Jun, Eldest Miss and Feng Long have yet to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey went out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Long invited Eldest Miss to the lake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the lake? En, I got it. It\u2019s fine, with Feng Long there, nothing will happen to Baili Yiling.\u201d Jun Xin made to head back into the room but discovered that Ye Chuan wasn\u2019t moving. \u201cIs there something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jun.\u201d Ye Chuan cupped his fist respectfully. \u201cWhere exactly did Master go? Why were Alliance Head Li and Eldest Miss the only ones to come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Jun Xin smiled and clapped Ye Chuan\u2019s shoulder firmly. \u201cIsn\u2019t your master always this way? Is it our place to stick our noses into his business? Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll be back after a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan lowered his eyes. \u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go back to doing whatever you were working on. I\u2019ve never seen you this nervous in the past when Baili Yu was gone for months! Don\u2019t overthink things and just head back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a creak, the door closed.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan\u2019s eyes darkened as he took a long look at the room. Young Master Jun, you told me not to overthink things, but how am I supposed to not worry when you\u2019re going out of your way to console me like this?</p><br/><p>Since Young Master Jun wouldn\u2019t tell him, he\u2019ll try looking for Feng Long.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaa, Ye Chuan has probably noticed.\u201d Jun Xin sighed after closing the door. Then his Adam\u2019s apple shifted and when he spoke again, his voice had already changed.</p><br/><p>However, it hurted a lot as if his throat had been grated by an iron file. \u201cWife.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hand on the bed abruptly jolted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, I\u2019m back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly, and by the time Baili Yiling noticed, she had already been in Plum Garden for over two weeks.</p><br/><p>After the news spread that Baili Yiling, Baili Yu\u2019s younger sister, had come back, countless people came to pay visits. There were people from famous families of the Jianghu and nobles from the imperial court. Baili Yiling was so busy that she barely had a moment to stand still, so she hadn\u2019t had a chance to go see Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Feng Long, who had been staying with her this entire tim,e watched as she skillfully met with these people. Her eyes darkened as she took this sight in. Hadn\u2019t Baili Yiling grown up in Cerulean Mountain?</p><br/><p>How did she become so skilled in dealing with people?</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Long? What are you spacing out for?\u201d After finally getting those sons of the emperor to leave, Baili Yiling glanced over at Feng Long and saw that he was spacing out. She walked up and flicked the chinaware that Feng Long was holding. \u201cThey came all this way just to gift a crappy jug like this? Don\u2019t these people have way too much free time on their hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whenever there were no outsiders around though, she would reveal her more mischievous and naive temperament.</p><br/><p>Feng Long looked towards her with a smile. \u201cEldest Miss, if the seventh prince found out that you called this priceless Clear Water China a crappy jug, he\u2019d probably die from anger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, no matter how beautiful it looks, a jug\u2019s still a jug. It\u2019s not like it can grow a flower. Isn\u2019t it just something some bored and rich hedonistic son made to get attention? This lady has no interest in things that don\u2019t have solid value.\u201d Baili Yiling walked back to Rain Building and sat down for a while before standing up again. \u201cFeng Long, I\u2019m going to go visit Sister-in-Law. You\u2019d better not stop me again today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Long hastily lowered her head. \u201cWhat is Eldest Miss saying? How could Feng Long dare to stop Eldest Miss? It\u2019s just that Young Master Jun has given orders that no one is to bother him for the time being. This subordinate must obey commands.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

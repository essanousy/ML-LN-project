Wonder if he has finished carrying it out for her?!</p><br/><p>Smacking her lips, a spirited light suddenly emerged in her clear eyes. Tang Doudou pulled Li Hong who was spacing out and pointed at the tall wall that encircled Plum Garden. \u201cLook, isn\u2019t that Hou Zi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, mah Alliance Head da ren. Look at this situation! How can you still have the mood to look at some monkey? In my opinion, I think we should just first\u2026\u201d After Tang Doudou slapped his shoulder, Li Hong started muttering a huge bunch helplessly. When he saw that slow-moving black dot along the wall clearly, his jaw immediately dropped. \u201cHou Zi, didn\u2019t Hou Zi leave a long time ago? Why would he be in Plum Garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>This wall was the only feature separating the Plum Garden from the Alliance Head Residence. It\u2019s unknown if it was because the Alliance Head Residence was poor or due to some other reason, but they didn\u2019t have their own boundary wall and just used the Plum Garden\u2019s unreasonably high wall as a barrier. At times, Tang Doudou would space out as she stared at that wall, thinking that the image of how the Alliance Head Residence was connected to the Plum Garden really made it seem like a small kitchen versus the main building.</p><br/><p>Haa, this is another sorrowful story.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou retrieved her thoughts and pushed Li Hong, who was in front of her, aside. \u201cHou Zi was just helping me do something. Who told you he left?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hong scratched his head. \u201cI saw him rush out that day so I thought he was the same as Syndicate Leader Xu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t even finished speaking when Xu Tao cried out in pleasant surprise as if he had discovered the New World. \u201cIt seems like Bai gongzi has also returned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Xiao Bai has come back? Where? Where\u2019s Xiao Bai?\u201d When Tang Doudou heard this she felt that this was what a truly pleasant surprise was supposed to be like. She then looked left and right, up and down, and everywhere, but didn\u2019t see a trace of that familiar white shadow. Hence, she slapped the back of Xu Tao head. \u201cDa hell, you tricked me for fun!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao rubbed the painful spot that Tang Doudou hit and said with a very grieved expression, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to trick Alliance Head da ren. Bai gongzi has really returned. I saw a white shadow flit past the side just now and was about to look closer when I discovered Master pulling Li Hong over to look at Hou Zi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Xiao Bai has come back as well. Let\u2019s just do this. You guys wait here. Once Hou Zi gets back, you guys just let him wait here a while. I\u2019ll come out to talk to him once I\u2019ve finished discussing matters with Bai gongzi.\u201d Worried that Xu Tao and Li Hong would run off halfway, she continued to comfort them. \u201cBai gongzi\u2019s already back, so what do you guys need to worry about? Just relax. We have to believe in Bai gongzi, he definitely has a plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s name was way more useful than hers. Once she mentioned Bai Feiyun\u2019s name, Xu Tao and Li Hong clearly looked more relieved. Li Hong sat down on the stone steps behind the door and said, \u201cAlliance Head da ren, you should go. Xu Tao and I will guard this place for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao spoke as well. \u201cIf the grand Alliance Head Residence can\u2019t even take care of something like this, how is it supposed to continue standing stably in the Jianghu? Alliance Head, you should just discuss this properly with Bai gongzi and see if there\u2019s any way to get Baili Yu to take back his decision? No matter what, two men getting married kind of offends public morals\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Tao, what are you saying!? What do you mean it offends public morals?! It\u2019s all Baili Yu\u2019s fault for doing it on purpose. I believe that even if Alliance Head da ren had ten leopard guts, it still wouldn\u2019t be possible for him to dare to bully Baili Yu. Not to mention, Baili Yu\u2019s martial arts is not something that our Alliance Head can overpower!\u201d Li Hong said indignantly. This was what he thought when he had first heard of this matter. It\u2019s extremely strange, how could Alliance Head possibly have topped Baili Yu?!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was also exceptionally speechless upon hearing the exchange between the two of them. She felt that what they were saying couldn\u2019t be counted as praise so she waved and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll head in first. I\u2019ll leave this side to you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she spoke, she didn\u2019t wait for the two to reply. With a \u2018swish\u2019, she squeezed into the underbrush by the side and ducked left and right as she ran towards the back courtyard.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t really want to hide and duck like this. Who asked those women outside to be so outrageous? Some even liked to climb onto the wall in their free time to see if Tang Doudou had appeared or not.</p><br/><p>In reality, they were also hesitating. They didn\u2019t even know if Tang Doudou was really in the Alliance Head Residence.</p><br/><p>Due to the fact that Tang Doudou react even a bit after so many days, everyone pretty much concluded that she had probably fled long ago. The reason they were surrounding the Alliance Head Residence was simply for the sake of venting the sadness in their hearts. Not matter who it was, it would still be hard to accept for a while for them to accept if their male idol suddenly released news that he was getting married, and it was even to a guy. For the sake of respecting and honoring the lost perfection in their hearts, there\u2019s no doubt that venting it was the best choice.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou could understand this quite well. If this incident had happened to anyone else, perhaps she would have even stood out to publicly talk about righteousness and other things.</p><br/><p>Collecting her random thoughts, she pushed open the doors to her room. Directly afterwards, she saw that trace of pure snow that caused people\u2019s hearts to calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaahwuuu, Xiao Bai ah! You\u2019ve finally come back! To be able to see you again in this lifetime is practically the Old Heavens granting fortune in a burst of kindness!\u201d Tang Doudou rushed over. As she looked at Bai Feiyun\u2019s familiar warm smile, she almost smacked a kiss over. Her heart was finally settling back into its place having seen him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t celebrate yet.\u201d Seeing Tang Doudou\u2019s ecstatic appearance, Bai Feiyun shook his head. The first thing out of his mouth was a blow to her.</p><br/><p>The smile on Tang Doudou\u2019s face froze when she heard this. \u201cWhat happened? Could it be that the method you talked about won\u2019t work anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe method still works. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s a problem that needs to be resolved as quickly as possible. Otherwise, this matter will only become more complicated.\u201d When the conversation led to the information he found out, Bai Feiyun started feeling a bit of a headache.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat problem?\u201d Tang Doudou continued to ask. As long as there\u2019s a problem, there would be a solution. The worst situation would be when you can\u2019t even find the root of the problem.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun muttered to himself irresolutely for a while as if trying to figure out how to start telling her.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he still didn\u2019t say a single word after a long while, Tang Doudou started urging him, \u201cAiyah, Xiao Bai, don\u2019t dawdle anymore. When I went out to take a look earlier, it seemed like the doors outside are on the verge of breaking from all the pounding. If you keep delaying, the only thing you can do for me later will probably be to collect my corpse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s actually no need to worry about that. When I entered earlier, I saw that most of the women outside had already left. From the looks of it, they\u2019ll probably disperse on their own in another two days. What we need to worry about right now is Baili Yu.\u201d Bai Feiyun rubbed the area between his brows. He truly felt helpless from the bottom of his heart when the name \u2018Baili Yu\u2019 was brought up. That man was seriously way too hard to predict.</p><br/><p>When he went to see the City Lord to notify him of this matter, the City Lord had been stunned for an entire ten minutes before he slowly expressed his opinion. \u201cXueyi\u2019s truly not bad. He\u2019s a person that does big things. Since it\u2019s like this, then might as well take Baili Yu as a bride. In any case, we don\u2019t lose anything from Xueyi marrying him!\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, the City Lord and Baili Yu were very similar in many senses of the word. It was just that the City Lord tends to scheme against people straightforwardly while Baili Yu always liked to wear a harmless smile before silently, without warning, cheat* people until there\u2019s not a single place left unharmed!</p><br/><p>I had already previously defined the word  to mean like cheat/fraud. However, Sigil brought up a better word which seems to fit perfectly: troll. But since troll is a modern word which shouldn\u2019t exist in the ancient world, I probably won\u2019t use it for anyone other than Tang Doudou. Lastly, I think the previous phrase was clear enough but in modern words it would be something like \u2018troll people like there\u2019s no tomorrow\u2019.</p><br/><p>To sum it up, they\u2019re both cheats!</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu? What did he freaking do again?\u201d Presently, whenever Tang Doudou heard his name her entire body would feel uncomfortable due to the urge to rush over to Plum Garden and bite that bastard to death. It was just a shame. It wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t try to do so, but before she could even climb over the wall to Plum Garden, Ye Chuan would coldly pick her up and throw her back every single time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d Bai Feiyun only threw out these four words after a long period of silent deliberation.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou placed her palm over her forehead. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this for now. Let\u2019s just talk about what to do next? In any case, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll take Baili Yu as a bride! I won\u2019t marry him even if I die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her speak as if making a vow and seeing her huffing mad little face, Bai Feiyun\u2019s smile became even gentler. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust ask!\u201d Tang Doudou sat at the side thinking through this matter\u2019s entire development. For some reason, she felt that there was something strange about all of this. However, she couldn\u2019t grasp what it was clearly. It seemed to be the crucial point of this matter, yet her brain simply couldn\u2019t grasp the turn and could only continue running around in circles as she dazed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to take Baili Yu as a bride?\u201d Bai Feiyun stared at her eyes, his expression a little serious.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou clearly didn\u2019t understand why Bai Feiyun would ask this. Wasn\u2019t the answer obvious?</p><br/><p>No matter what she can\u2019t take Baili Yu as a bride ah!</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s eyes lowered as he continued to speak. \u201cOnce you marry him, not only would your position as the Alliance Head become as strong as an impregnable fortress, even the City Lord would fear you a little. There\u2019s no need to even detail the Imperial Household. Baili Yu has never worried about the Imperial Household. As long as he exists, you could decide the fate of all the lands below heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>If these words came out from anyone else\u2019s mouth, Tang Doudou would definitely send a palm over with a \u2018huala\u2019. She conceded that Baili Yu looked pretty awesome. However, no matter how awesome he was, he couldn\u2019t be awesome to the point that the entire world was within his grasp, right?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that a little too exaggerated? What, could it be that those emperors and alliance heads were all here just to buy soy sauce? (aka play small useless roles)</p><br/><p>This was Tang Doudou\u2019s first thought. However, after seeing Bai Feiyun\u2019s serious face and realizing that he wasn\u2019t joking, she asked dimwittedly, \u201cXiao Bai, are you sure you\u2019re not mistaken?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun sighed. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve really forgotten everything of the past. In the past, you revered Baili Yu quite a lot. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that there was the City Lord there to stop you, you would have already gone looking for Baili Yu long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the first time he had talked about Li Xueyi in front of her so Tang Doudou immediately became interested and questioned him closely, \u201cThat means we\u2019re quite familiar with each other after all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Otherwise, how would he know of these things?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t reply to her question but continued speaking. \u201cThe endless wealth that Baili Yu possesses is already enough to cause people\u2019s eyes to turn green with envy. However, in addition to that, he also grasps the economic lifelines of several countries including Spirit Virtue Imperial Court and its neighboring countries. That\u2019s why the Imperial Household simply doesn\u2019t dare to touch him at all. Other than his shocking wealth, he even has several large powers that cannot be underestimated. The most worthy of mention are those three subordinates of his\u2026 Blood Fiend Jun Xin, Blade Demon Feng Long, Godspeed Yun Hai. Of those three, you\u2019ve seen Blood Fiend Jun Xin before. Don\u2019t underestimate him due to his young age. His martial arts is actually ranked first place on the potentials listing of Cloud City.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard that, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t hold herself back anymore. She really wanted to reach out and touch Bai Feiyun\u2019s forehead to find out if he had a fever. Otherwise, why would he keep talking nonsense like this?</p><br/><p>At most, that butt-aged brat just had a bad temper. How did he turn into some blood fiend? Just listening to this sounded really scary, alright?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way to link that with Jun Xin\u2019s shotacon baby face!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the City Lord isn\u2019t clear on how strong Baili Yu himself is. No matter if it\u2019s the Jianghu or the Imperial Court, they all feel extreme restrained fear towards him. However, they\u2019ve never united to defeat him. Do you know why this is so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou dumbly shook her head. How the hell could she fricking know?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun suddenly reached out and stroked Tang Doudou\u2019s head, seeming to feel pity for her. \u201cBecause Baili Yu is sick!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

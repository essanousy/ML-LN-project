Little Bell is really fast, I was only able to shake off those annoying guys due to him!\u201d Baili Yiling patted Little Bell\u2019s neck. \u201cLittle Bell, this is my sister-in-law, got it? You can\u2019t throw a tantrum!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she jumped onto the horse before turning to offer a hand to Tang Doudou. \u201cSister-in-Law, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two rushed through the night on horseback as countless figures followed behind them. The whistling of the wind was so loud even Tang Doudou noticed the presence of the people behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we shake them off?\u201d Tang Doudou glanced behind them worriedly as she hugged the black chest tightly. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Yiling, do you know Feng Long very well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Sister-in-Law, it\u2019s just a few pieces of trash, Little Bell can shake them off easily!\u201d Baili Yiling laughed, then patted Little Bell\u2019s head as she said, \u201cLittle Bell, help Big Sister shake off those bad people, alright? If you do, Big Sister will give you tanghulu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gazed at the sky. Could this horse even understand what they were saying?</p><br/><p>And what the heck was with tanghulu? Why did this horse have the same tastes as Jun Xin?</p><br/><p>What was a horse eating tanghulu for\u2026</p><br/><p>However, the moment Little Bell heard \u2018tanghulu,\u2019 he reacted like he was hit up with chicken blood and lifted his hooves high before shooting forward like an arrow. If it weren\u2019t for Baili Yiling\u2019s quick reaction in grabbing Tang Doudou who was behind her, Tang Doudou definitely would\u2019ve fallen off the horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bell, don\u2019t mess around. I\u2019ll spank you!\u201d Baili Yiling\u2019s expression turned stern and she slapped Little Bell\u2019s ear firmly.</p><br/><p>Little Bell snorted sulkily. He didn\u2019t slow down, but the ride became a lot more stable.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bell is really smart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law, don\u2019t praise him, he\u2019ll get smug.\u201d Baili Yiling glanced behind them. \u201cIt\u2019ll only take a little while longer to shake those people off, but there\u2019s one person that I can\u2019t shake off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still people?\u201d Tang Doudou looked backwards as well. Suddenly, a figure crossed her mind. \u201cIs it Mu Ye?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear sister-in-law ah, that Demonic Sect Leader has been following you this entire time. Could it be that you didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge! No way, right?\u201d Baili Yiling\u2019s words stunned her. If Mu Ye had been following her this entire time, why hadn\u2019t he shown himself when she was at Dream Mountain?</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling asked slowly, \u201cSister-in-Law, it couldn\u2019t be that you don\u2019t even know how many people are following you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t reply. Baili Yiling burst out laughing. \u201cSister-in-law, you\u2019re so cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, stop laughing at me.\u201d Tang Doudou glanced behind them and saw that there was no longer anyone following them. \u201cSince they\u2019re gone, let\u2019s slow down. I want to call for Mu Ye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t show himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he was going to show himself, he would\u2019ve done so already. Something is probably stopping him from showing himself. Since he doesn\u2019t want to show himself, you shouldn\u2019t try to get him to come out.\u201d Baili Yiling giggled, then said, \u201cIf you look for him, my brother will get jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou blushed and stopped speaking.</p><br/><p>She understood as well that if Mu Ye had been planning to appear, he would\u2019ve already done so the last couple of times that she was in danger. He wouldn\u2019t wait until she went to look for him. However, she couldn\u2019t quite understand what he was trying to do.</p><br/><p>And where did Nan Maner go?</p><br/><p>The skies had been very clear during the day, so at night, the stars were particularly bright. She recalled what Baili Yu said about going stargazing with her every night. However, since he left, it had been raining non stop, so she couldn\u2019t go stargazing even if she wanted to.</p><br/><p>There were finally stars tonight, but he wasn\u2019t here.</p><br/><p>With the stars as a location reference, Tang Doudou was able to figure out that they were heading towards the south side of Huai City. That was the direction she had headed in the first time she left Huai City. That time, she had been heading towards Azure Water Valley, where were they heading this time?</p><br/><p>A night passed, and the morning caused drops of dew to condense on the surface of the leaves and flowers. As the horse galloped past, those droplets of water flew up and gradually soaked its fur.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law, Little Bell needs a rest, so let\u2019s take a break!\u201d Baili Yiling pulled on the reins, then leapt off the horse before turning back to help Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily said, \u201cI can get down by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t do, what if my nephew gets hurt?\u201d Baili Yiling glanced towards Tang Doudou\u2019s abdomen. It was probably about five months old now, why was it completely not visible? It couldn\u2019t be that something was wrong with her nephew?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou asked, \u201cWhat nephew?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling came back to her senses and said with a laugh, \u201cWhat I mean is, Sister-in-Law will be giving birth to my nephew in the future, it\u2019d be terrible if you get injured!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was nothing Tang Doudou could say in response to Baili Yiling\u2019s weird way of thinking. Even when she tried to present reason, in front of Yiling, she felt like a child that was completely being played around with.</p><br/><p>However, she really was sore from riding the horse all night, so she took Baili Yiling\u2019s offer of help and jumped down while pressing on her hand. Then, she sat down on a nearby rock to catch her breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bell, you can go. I\u2019ll call you when we\u2019re about to leave!\u201d Baili Yiling allowed Little Bell to roam off so that he could graze, then she sat down next to Tang Doudou. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here so, Sister-in-Law, tell me what happened these past couple of months. What exactly did you run into?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s actually nothing much\u2026 Ever since I set off from Huai City, I was just rushing to travel\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Jun Xin had sent Baili Yiling, this meant that this matter didn\u2019t have much to do with Baili Yiling. The question was, why was Yun Hai restricting Jun Xin\u2019s movements and not Baili Yiling\u2019s? However, she couldn\u2019t very well ask Baili Yiling this.</p><br/><p>She was hoping that after she finished talking about what she went though, Baili Yiling would also talk about what happened in Huai City. However, unexpectedly, after Baili Yiling finished listening to her narrative, she nodded and said, \u201cBased on what you\u2019re saying, it\u2019s not certain that Big Brother is Big Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence stunned Tang Doudou. \u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019m certain that he\u2019s your brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange expression flashed across Baili Yiling\u2019s face. She didn\u2019t continue speaking about it and called Little Bell over so that they could continue traveling.</p><br/><p>During all their breaks, they chatted happily. The only thing was, whenever something related to Baili Yu was brought up, Baili Yiling would either change the topic, or make an excuse to go do something.</p><br/><p>This made Tang Doudou even more certain that something was up. In the end, she decided to just stop cooperating until Baili Yiling told her what was going on.</p><br/><p>When Baili Yiling saw that Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t going to budge, she sighed, then finally said, \u201cSister-in-Law, do you know why Jun Xin took over the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce?\u201d</p><br/><p>If she knew, would she be asking right now? Although this was what Tang Doudou was thinking, she just shook her head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling pulled her to the side of the road and had her sit down. She still hesitated a little. \u201cSister-in-Law, don\u2019t get too stirred up from what I\u2019m about to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say it, I\u2019ll be fine!\u201d Though she said this, her heart was already starting to pound uneasily.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, a couple days after you and Jun Xin left, the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce ran into trouble\u2026\u201d Baili Yiling only started talking about it after confirming that Tang Doudou seemed pretty calm.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. If something had happened just a few days after they left, could it be that someone knew of their plan to leave?</p><br/><p>This timing would be way too much of a coincidence otherwise.</p><br/><p>The following words Baili Yiling said truly stunned her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw the arrest posters sent out for you and Big Brother in the cities, right? Actually, those crimes weren\u2019t randomly pinned on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou laughed. \u201cHow\u2019s that possible? Even if I know how to make a doppelganger of myself, I still wouldn\u2019t be able to do so many terrible things in such a short period of time! Moreover, I spent that entire time rushing to Hibiscus Garrison. Once I got there, I was with your big brother the entire time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law, are you really sure that he\u2019s Big Brother?\u201d Baili Yiling leaned closer and asked this question while peering at her seriously.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

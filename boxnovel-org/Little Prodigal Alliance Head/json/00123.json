She was immediately stunned by the piles of clothing that seemed to contain every color under the sun!</p><br/><p>Jesus ah! There are probably over a thousand garments at the very least!</p><br/><p>Are there that many styles of historical clothing?</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Doudou.\u201d Just as she was about to fall apart, the sound of Qing He knocking came from outside the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d replied Tang Doudou hastily. She casually picked up a garment and started putting it on.</p><br/><p>Hearing her flustered voice, Qing He said with a slightly apologetic tone, \u201cLady Doudou, were you shocked? I\u2019m sorry. I was just worried that you wouldn\u2019t like the colors I picked so I brought all the colors for each style\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder there were so many clothes. As it turned out, she had moved the contents of an entire ready-made clothing store over!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou covered her forehead. However, since the person had done it out of good intentions, she couldn\u2019t really blame her. Thus, she said, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I like all of these colors and the clothes a lot. Thank you very much, Qing He.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing He acknowledged politely, then left.</p><br/><p>Only then did Tang Doudou exhale and start to get dressed in preparation to go find Baili Yu. However, now that she was actually looking at the clothing, she realized that the size was huge. It didn\u2019t cover the places it should and for the places it shouldn\u2019t cover, it also didn\u2019t cover. In short, it was no different from those racy undergarments.</p><br/><p>She hastily pulled it off and dug out something that was more normal to put on. Then she grabbed the medicine and went to find Qing He.</p><br/><p>When she found Qing He, Qing He told her that Baili Yu was meeting with someone. Who knows what they were talking about in the middle of the night?</p><br/><p>Hence Tang Doudou could only take the things and go daze out on a rooftop of the courtyard. At this moment, Ye Chuan finally arrived. He spotted Tang Doudou with a single glance and waved towards her.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan had returned, and he also looked in pretty good shape. Thus, Tang Doudou happily jumped off the roof and started running towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally back!\u201d said Tang Doudou happily after she got close.</p><br/><p>After this incident, Ye Chuan\u2019s attitude towards her became much better. However, when he saw that she was wearing female clothing again, he couldn\u2019t help but chide her with his brows furrowed, \u201cWhy did Master allow you to wear female clothing again? As a man you should uphold the proper image of a man. Even if you\u2019re going to marry Master, you\u2019re still a man! How can you keep wearing female clothing all the time!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes but didn\u2019t feel like explaining to him. She pulled him to the side and said unhappily, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this. There\u2019s still a matter that I haven\u2019t settled with you yet. If you don\u2019t give me an explanation this time, I\u2019ll have Baili Yu expel you, got it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan wasn\u2019t afraid of her threat at all. He pushed her away and said, \u201cWe can talk about things later, I have to find Master first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was about to leave, Tang Doudou hastily grabbed him. \u201cBaili Yu\u2019s talking with someone right now. Even if you go you wouldn\u2019t be able to see him! You had better just wait with me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already so late, how could Master still be talking with someone?\u201d Doubt flashed through Ye Chuan\u2019s eyes when he heard what Tang Doudou said. This was completely different from Master\u2019s usual style ah. He never had meetings at night and no meetings had ever lasted past an hour.</p><br/><p>Thus, he asked, \u201cHow long has Master been talking with the person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou stretched out her fingers and thought for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s probably been almost an hour\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words had just landed when Ye Chuan\u2019s figure disappeared from her sights.</p><br/><p>Huh? Where\u2019d the person go?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

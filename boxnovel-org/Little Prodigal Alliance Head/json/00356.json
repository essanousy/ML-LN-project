However, when she got a clear look at this person, she greeted him sweetly, \u201cNinth Uncle! Why didn\u2019t you say anything? You almost scared us to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ninth Uncle?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had question marks in both eyes. This person was clearly Shen Moru, how had he become Baili Yiling\u2019s Ninth Uncle?</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling seemed to sense her confusion, because she then introduced them. \u201cSister-in-Law, don\u2019t be scared. Ninth Uncle isn\u2019t Shen Moru, they only look a little alike. However, it\u2019s not strange because they\u2019re related, right, Ninth Uncle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d The man being addressed as Ninth Uncle replied softly before turning to look at Tang Doudou. \u201cThis is your big brother\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Ninth Uncle, don\u2019t you think that Big Brother\u2019s taste is really good? Isn\u2019t my sister-in-law a beauty capable of toppling a city and making the moon feel ashamed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good match for your big brother,\u201d replied Ninth Uncle.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling\u2019s smile immediately widened even more. She pulled Tang Doudou and said excitedly, \u201cSister-in-Law, Ninth Uncle just praised you! Hurry and call him Ninth Uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fudge, a wife had to meet her in-laws sooner or later, but she had never heard of a sister-in-law being the one to introduce the in-laws.</p><br/><p>She silently complained. Fudge, Yiling should have warned her! If she had known that they were here to see Baili Yu\u2019s relatives, she would\u2019ve changed before heading over.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law.\u201d When Baili Yiling saw that Tang Doudou was spacing out, she tugged on Tang Doudou\u2019s clothes and quietly prompted her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou came back to her senses. Just as she was about to greet the man, that Ninth Uncle turned and walked forward. \u201cLet\u2019s go, the tribesmen are waiting for you two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he walked a bit further away, Tang Doudou lowered her voice and asked, \u201cWhy does it feel like your ninth uncle is a little weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been like this, don\u2019t mind it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did he arrive earlier? Did he hear what we said about your brother losing his memories? Yiling, I can\u2019t help but feel uneasy.\u201d She pressed on her chest. She didn\u2019t know if it was the location or the fact that Ninth Uncle looked so much like Shen Moru, but she felt very uneasy.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling was walking ahead of Tang Doudou so she didn\u2019t notice Tang Doudou\u2019s abnormality. She walked for quite a while before she realized that there were no footsteps coming from behind her and turned around to check. When she saw that there was no trace of Tang Doudou, she immediately became flustered. \u201cSister-in-Law!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law!\u201d Baili Yiling\u2019s face turned pale. This sinkhole wasn\u2019t some place to play in. Just a single wrong step could claim one\u2019s life because this place was filled with traps that the tribesmen had set.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling didn\u2019t dare to run around to look on her own either. She gritted her teeth. The best choice right now was to find Ninth Uncle and the rest so that they could help her look.</p><br/><p>Hopefully they\u2019d make it in time!</p><br/><p>Not long after she left, Tang Doudou climbed out of the underbrush dizzily. She rubbed her pulsing temples. Why did she faint?</p><br/><p>When she looked around, she saw that Baili Yiling was nowhere in sight. That girl couldn\u2019t have left her here, right?</p><br/><p>Fudge!</p><br/><p>The reason she fainted was probably because this place was too strange. It was definitely due to radiation. However, why did it seem like Baili Yiling and the other tribesmen weren\u2019t affected at all? This wouldn\u2019t do, she had to hurry and find Yiling, then leave.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to start walking, she realized that someone was in front of her. She stopped and looked towards person walking to her with a confused frown. \u201cNinth Uncle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have no right to call me that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ninth Uncle\u2019s tone was still mild like before, but it contained faint hostility. Tang Doudou found it strange. Why was he hostile towards her?</p><br/><p>\u201cNinth Uncle, this seems to be the first time that we\u2019ve met? Nothing has happened between us before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ninth Uncle\u2019s expression turned dark and he snarled, \u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but become pissed off when he was hostile for no reason. \u201cYou think I want to come here? If it wasn\u2019t Yiling that brought me here, who would come to this damned gloomy hole? It\u2019s not fit for humans at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fudge! If a pregnant woman stayed here for long, it would probably affect their unborn child.</p><br/><p>What exactly was the Baili family thinking, to pick some place like this for seclusion?</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t they worried at all about their descendants dying out?</p><br/><p>In addition, although Baili Yiling seemed very friendly with them, when Baili Yu talked about being responsible for these people, his expression was filled with pain.</p><br/><p>This tribe that hid themselves from the world like turtles put the burden of their lives on the shoulders of one small child, yet they were acting like it was natural to do so!</p><br/><p>\u201cWretch! You dared to yell at me?\u201d Ninth Uncle\u2019s eyes turned red from anger when he heard Tang Doudou complaining about this place being unfit for humans. He rushed up and seized her by the throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, why would Yu er meet with a mishap? It\u2019s all because of you! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Ninth Uncle looked insane. The veins on his forehead and the back of his hands were bulging out unnaturally.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t expected for him to suddenly rush up. By the time she managed to react, there was already an echoing hum in her head due to lack of air. She tried to push him away, but her shoves were as useless as if she was hitting an iron wall.</p><br/><p>Could it be that she was going to die here?</p><br/><p>After surviving so many dangerous situations, she was actually going to die at the entrance of Baili Yu\u2019s home?</p><br/><p>How ironic.</p><br/><p>She was probably the only one in the world who would think about these things at death\u2019s door. Anyone else would be focused on fighting for their life right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Ninth Uncle\u2019s voice reverberated in the spacious sinkhole and bounced back like someone was answering. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you, kill you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, a flustered fearful expression appeared on his face and he hastily released her and retreated backwards while looking around in alarm. His originally oppressive aura instantly disappeared. As the echos of \u2018I\u2019ll kill you\u2019 continued, he laced his hands together and started shaking his hands in a begging manner. \u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s not me! Don\u2019t kill me, don\u2019t kill me! It really wasn\u2019t me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cough cough cough\u2026 Tang Doudou pressed on her throat as she gasped for breath. She looked towards Ninth Uncle. His current condition, did he go insane?</p><br/><p>Or was it that he had long already gone insane due to living here?</p><br/><p>Radioactivity tended to affect the brain after all. Tang Doudou got up while leaning against the tree trunk behind her. Even without a mirror, she knew that five clear bruises were definitely forming on her neck. Ninth Uncle had been serious about killing her.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t stay here! She had to get away now!</p><br/><p>As she was thinking this, she kept an eye on Ninth Uncle\u2019s movements and slowly backed away. However, after a few steps, she recalled Baili Yiling. She didn\u2019t know how these people thought of Baili Yiling. Although Baili Yiling had greeted Ninth Uncle very enthusiastically earlier, this Ninth Uncle hadn\u2019t shown much reaction. What if they took things out on Baili Yiling once she left?</p><br/><p>After all, Baili Yiling also wasn\u2019t a true member of the Saint Tribes\u2026 pei pei! What as she thinking? Baili Yiling\u2019s brain worked much better than hers! She\u2019d definitely be able to find her way out.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her head, then shook it to try to clear the dizziness. She had to hurry and get away from this Ninth Uncle. Once Baili Yiling realized that she was gone, she\u2019d definitely come back to look for her. It wouldn\u2019t be too late to tell Baili Yiling about these things then.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop right there! You can\u2019t escape!\u201d As soon as she started to move, Ninth Uncle\u2019s demon-like voice appeared from behind her. Before she could even react, his hand had already landed on her shoulder.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Lou Qingyun sure was like a cockroach. She had thought he was dead several times already, yet he survived!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was rather happy to hear Lou Qingyun\u2019s voice. The two were pretty much comrades that had gone through life or death trials and tribulations together. When she found out he wasn\u2019t dead, she was delighted and hastily ran towards the voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you had already died. Your vitality sure is strong!\u201d Tang Doudou exclaimed as she ran.</p><br/><p>These words probably injured Lou Qingyun a little because he replied gloomily, \u201cNo better, no worse (than you)\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he was heavily injured and so his words were completely weak. Tang Doudou laughed at him. \u201cWho\u2019s no better, no worse with you? I\u2019m not injured at all. From the sound of your voice, even if you\u2019re not dead, aren\u2019t you pretty close?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun choked from her words and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t waste time and reached Lou Qingyun in a few steps. As she took in his miserable appearance, she felt complete pity for him.</p><br/><p>His clothes had been worn out to shreds and exposed the bruised skin under. There were even little Black Demonic Nightcrawlers hanging off some areas. Upon seeing this, Tang Doudou picked up some of the rice straw that was burning to the side and moved it towards those Black Demonic Nightcrawlers.</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun immediately opened his eyes and glowered at her. \u201cWhat are you planning to do!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get rid of these Black Demonic Nightcrawlers, you\u2019ll die!\u201d Tang Doudou lifted the burning rice straw in her hand and moved it towards the Black Demonic Nightcrawler. She saw the bug withdraw backwards and exclaimed happily, \u201cI think these little things are afraid of fire. Endure the pain a little, I\u2019ll get them out. Rest for a while, then we can leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to save me?\u201d Lou Qingyun looked at her, astonished. It was to the point that he didn\u2019t even notice when Tang Doudou pressed the fire against his skin. \u201cEven if you get rid of the Black Demonic Nightcrawlers, I still can\u2019t move. If you leave me, you\u2019ll definitely be able to get out. But if you bring me along, that won\u2019t be certain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, even you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s not certain. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t leave you behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou started thinking, but her hands continued to move. In reality, she wasn\u2019t that good-hearted. When she heard Lou Qingyun say that he couldn\u2019t move, she also hesitated a little. However, on second thought, if she really watched with her own eyes as another living person died, especially if it was because she didn\u2019t extend a hand to help, she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep soundly for the rest of her life.</p><br/><p>When Lou Qingyun heard what she said, he was so moved he couldn\u2019t even speak. Just as he was about to say some words of gratitude, he heard Tang Doudou continue. \u201cOf course, the remuneration can\u2019t be left out. An ordinary antique lamp already costs five thousand taels, so a person as big as you should probably be worth several ten thousand taels right? However, looking upon the fact that we\u2019ve gone through trials and tribulations together, I\u2019ll give you an appropriate discount when the time comes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeveral ten thousands? Why don\u2019t you just rob me!?\u201d Lou Qingyun was left speechless. He had actually thought her kindness had flared up. Turns out it was for the sake of money!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe risk in robbing is too great, it\u2019s not a suitable choice for people as civilized as me. Saving people is still better. Not only can you earn money, you can also boost your reputation.\u201d As Tang Doudou chattered, she switched through several stalks of rice straws. Finally, she managed to get all the bugs off Lou Qingyun\u2019s body. After stamping them to death, she lifted her head and asked Lou Qingyun, \u201cWhat do you think about this deal? Isn\u2019t it worthwhile? A couple ten thousand taels to trade for one human life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, this, you\u2019re taking advantage of the fire to loot a burning house!\u201d Lou Qingyun exclaimed weakly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right ah, I am taking advantage of the fire to loot a burning house. Who asked God to have me take a wifey but not even possess the money to arrange the wedding matters? Aiy\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou sighed. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve gotten all the bugs off for you. As for that deal, it just depends on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Lou Qingyun notice that all the bugs on his arm had been gotten rid of. Quite a few black coal marks were left on his arm and there was even the scent of roasted meat. When he smelled that, Lou Qingyun became completely speechless. Did she directly roast the bugs along with his flesh!?</p><br/><p>Luckily, he had long been hurt so bad that his senses had gone completely numb. Otherwise, he definitely would have fainted from the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to marry Baili Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t she acting pretty unwilling earlier on the streets?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince he\u2019s sent himself to my door, isn\u2019t it a waste to turn him out? Not to mention, since he\u2019s becoming my bride, he has to give me a dowry, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, you sure are direct.\u201d Lou Qingyun was speechless.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. Direct? As if! She just has no other alternatives ah!</p><br/><p>Making it so that everyone thought she was doing it for the sake of Baili Yu\u2019s money was also a good choice. It was perfect for covering up the fact that she had been poisoned by the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Qingyun, yes or no? Give some response ah!\u201d Upon seeing that Lou Qingyun wasn\u2019t responding, Tang Doudou started urging him. The surrounding fire was growing bigger and bigger. Earlier the ground was too damp and so the fire wasn\u2019t as strong, but after burning for a while, the heat had dried out a lot of the rice straw. If this continued on, this place was going to turn into a sea of flames.</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun gritted his teeth and said with a rather helpless tone, \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to trouble Alliance Head Li to bring me out.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is having a clear view of things! Tang Doudou smiled. In reality, even if he didn\u2019t agree to it, she still would have brought him out. However, wouldn\u2019t it be stupid not to seize a benefit when it\u2019s laid out for you?</p><br/><p>However, Lou Qingyun\u2019s words were a little off ah!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou laughed \u2018hehe\u2019, then elbowed Lou Qingyun a little. \u201cThen, how are we supposed to get up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun blinked several times as he looked at her. When he saw that there wasn\u2019t the slightest trace of insincerity in those sparkling eyes, he was completely speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, doesn\u2019t this require big Young Master Lou\u2019s resourcefulness? You\u2019ll come up with the idea and I\u2019ll come up with the strength. Isn\u2019t that a great combination?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much money is Alliance Head Li prepared to pay for my idea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. Once we get out, this Alliance Head will definitely calculate it fairly. Lou gongzi will definitely be treated fairly! Right now, you had better think of an idea quick. Any longer and we\u2019ll become roasted meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>What else could Lou Qingyun say?</p><br/><p>It was still Lou Qingyun\u2019s brain that worked better. He talked and explained a bunch of stuff regarding mechanisms, then instructed Tang Doudou to carry him and head towards the pile of broken iron chains next to the large hole.</p><br/><p>The first step was to carry a big man so Tang Doudou thought it would take a lot of energy. However, after she lifted him up on her back, she realized that it wasn\u2019t that hard. Looks like this was a benefit of Li Xueyi\u2019s valiant constitution along with the concentrated amount of inner strength. In a short while, she made it from one end of the palace to the other end.</p><br/><p>This place was precisely the place Xin Yue used to be in. Due to the fact that her entire body had exploded from the force of one palm strike from Tang Doudou, all her iron chains had shattered into debris as well. Because of this, the area Tang Doudou was currently walking on was filled with blood-and-flesh-covered iron chain pieces. The wretched sight was so terrible the two didn\u2019t dare to lower their heads to look.</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun recalled the back figure he saw before he fainted and looked pensively at the back of Tang Doudou\u2019s head for a long while, his eyes filled with a mysterious deep light.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here, right?\u201d Tang Doudou looked around. \u201cYou said this place had a switch so why did you want us to go out from the ceiling earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Xin Yue here, even if I knew there was a switch, I couldn\u2019t risk coming over. That\u2019s why I could only think of some other idea\u2026\u201d Lou Qingyun explained.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded and said in approval, \u201cYou\u2019re rather smart ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>This is something that anything human would be able to think of, alright?</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun didn\u2019t even know how many times he had been made speechless today. Not bothering to reply to her imbecile-like question, he patted Tang Doudou\u2019s shoulder so that she would let him down.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked up and around, then asked him, \u201cYou sure you want to go down?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Lou Qingyun also looked at the floor, then decisively declined. \u201cI\u2019ll stay above.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just that Tang Doudou\u2019s figure was too delicate and small, both her waist and her shoulders seemed very frail. When she walked, she kept swaying and wobbling as if she was about to trip and fall so he kept worrying about crushing her. That was why Lou Qingyun wanted to get down and see if he could walk on his own. However, the ground was covered with blood ah, flesh ah, and even some Black Demonic Nightcrawlers that haven\u2019t been burned to death yet. Thus he decided it would be better for him to behave and stay on her back.</p><br/><p>How could Tang Doudou know that he had all those worries? As she felt the surrounding temperature rise, she hastily asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the switch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the pillar over there. Look and see if there\u2019s any area that\u2019s not like the rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Tang Doudou rushed over to the pillar.</p><br/><p>The stone pillar was very large and its diameter was about the length of three people\u2019s outstretched arms. Some strange decorative four-legged beasts were engraved on it, however, it had been too long so they were all faded. The entire pillar was so mottled and the designs so disconnected that it was impossible to make out with the naked eye what part was different.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t see, try using your hand to feel around for it,\u201d Lou Qingyun said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll put you to the side first?\u201d Although it didn\u2019t take a lot of energy for her to carry him this way, Lou Qingyun\u2019s body weight and height were still there. After walking for awhile, she felt a little tired. While she could still carry him with both hands, she felt that she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to with one hand.</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun thought she was tired so he quickly replied, \u201cAlright, you can put me down. Just don\u2019t put me on those bugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lowered her head and looked for a place that was a little cleaner. Then she wanted to put Lou Qingyun down, but no matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t crouch down. After struggling for a while, she just dropped Lou Qingyun onto the ground as if he were a sack. The second person didn\u2019t manage to react in time and fell so hard he grimaced. \u201cAre you trying to make me fall to my death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, sorry, my mistake, my mistake\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou patted her aching arms. Without paying attention to Lou Qingyun, she headed to feel that pillar. She felt around the entire pillar in order, yet she couldn\u2019t feel anything out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>She turned back to ask Lou Qingyun. \u201cThat\u2019s not right ah, how come there isn\u2019t a switch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeel it more closely. The switch won\u2019t be that conspicuous so if you don\u2019t examine it closely, you won\u2019t be able to find it.\u201d Lou Qingyun had watched her feel around like a little lady and spoke with a dumbfounded tone.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou replied \u2018oh\u2019, then turned around to continue feeling the stone pillar. This time, she slowed down and even patted a lot of the dust left over from the engravings. Finally, at a part of the ground that was engraved with something that was either a crane or a heron, Tang Doudou found a moveable rock piece. Her filthy little face turned elated. \u201cLou Qingyun, I\u2019ve found it! I\u2019ve found it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, we\u2019re saved!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou turned around, rushed towards Lou Qingyun and gave him a huge bear hug. \u201cHaha, we can finally leave this damned place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun turned rigid when she hugged him and a strange feeling came from his heart. However, before he had a chance to think deeply about it, Tang Doudou had released him and reached out to help him up. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll help you over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet, don\u2019t be hasty.\u201d Lou Qingyun slapped away her hand. \u201cYou should go test it out first to see if it\u2019s the switch we need.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably quite a lot of switches in this huge palace. I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s not the one we\u2019re looking for. If that\u2019s the case, when the time comes it\u2019ll be troublesome.\u201d Seeing that Tang Doudou seemed confused, Lou Qingyun said this in explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha, doesn\u2019t that mean that if this isn\u2019t the exit switch, we still have to keep looking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty much. There\u2019s no time to lose, Alliance Head Li should hurry to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hell, she celebrated a little too early. Tang Doudou was annoyed as she walked towards that pillar again. \u201cWill this switch be dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, her hand paused on that stone piece. However, she didn\u2019t hear Lou Qingyun\u2019s reply so she turned back curiously. Unexpectedly, Lou Qingyun had stood up at some unknown time. He was supporting himself with one hand on the wall and smiling sinisterly.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

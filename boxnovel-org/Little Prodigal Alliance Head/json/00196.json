However, she couldn\u2019t see anything because it had been wrapped up with bandages. She let go of the blanket, feeling very depressed. She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d have to stay in bed again this time. It was seriously demanding her old life! She had never had a peaceful day since coming here. If she was offered the choice to go back, she really wanted to just walk away from all this.</p><br/><p>But then she asked herself, if she really did have an opportunity to leave, would she really be able to bear leaving all of this behind?</p><br/><p>Would she be able to bear parting with these friends?</p><br/><p>Parting with the big evil spirit?</p><br/><p>But the big evil spirit said that he had put that lamp in Plum Garden for her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou pulled the blanket over her head and sighed. Xiao Bai said that she had to rest for half a month, so didn\u2019t that mean Su Yi\u2019s scheme was going to fail?</p><br/><p>Would the big evil spirit still come to find her?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was very distressed. She started worrying about Mu Ye again and wondered how he was right now.</p><br/><p>As she lay there, all sorts of thoughts raced through her brain and she couldn\u2019t fall asleep at all.</p><br/><p>Just as she was starting to get fidgetly, Bai Feiyun came back carrying medicine.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave the medicine first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The distinctive bitter smell of medicine was apparent from far away. Tang Doudou covered her nose. \u201cSo bitter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood medicine tastes bitter.\u201d Bai Feiyun helped her up and rearranged her pillow to support her before blowing on a spoonful of medicine and feeding it to her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt a bit awkward watching him carefully move the spoon over and reached out to take the bowl. </p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun moved her hand away and said gently, \u201cBe good, don\u2019t move around. I\u2019ll feed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tone was so gentle that it melted one\u2019s heart. Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t bring herself to reject his good intentions a second time and could only obediently drink the medicine.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun put the bowl away, satisfied, then started talking about serious matters. \u201cIn a bit, Senior Cang will be coming and he might ask you some questions about your Disseminating Tassel Fragrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately tensed up when the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance was brought up. \u201cWhat happened with the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance now? Is the poison flaring up again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Senior Cang said that your poison has already been cured. That\u2019s why he wants to find out what happened,\u201d Bai Feiyun answered nonchalantly. However, there was a trace of probing deep within his eyes.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was currently still taken aback by his words and didn\u2019t notice that Bai Feiyun seemed a little strange. She muttered to herself, \u201cIt\u2019s cured? It\u2019s actually cured? But why is it cured now?\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s too strange ah!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was completely confused. She couldn\u2019t figure out if it was because of the Black Demonic Nightcrawler\u2019s heart or because of something else\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t disrupt her thoughts. He simply collected the medicine bowl and the other things and went back out.</p><br/><p>After that, Cang Baicao did come and ask her about the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance. However, she herself still hadn\u2019t figured it out yet so there was no way she was able to give him any clues. After being questioned for half the day, she got worn out and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>The next time she woke up was already the next day.</p><br/><p>The moment she opened her eyes, she was given a scare by Su Yi\u2019s wide eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing ah!? I thought it was some dead person staring at me!\u201d Su Yi\u2019s gaze was truly very chilling. It almost scared her soul flying.</p><br/><p>Su Yi laughed \u2018hehe\u2019 and said, \u201cBai Feiyun said you had already woken up yesterday but I hadn\u2019t believed him. I believe it now that I see how lively you are. Girl, do you want to eat anything? I\u2019ll get you anything you want to eat! Don\u2019t hold back, I\u2019ll get anything you want!\u201d</p><br/><p>That good?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at Su Yi suspiciously, feeling that this old fox definitely had some hidden bad intention. \u201cYou have dragon and phoenix meat too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s expression froze, then he forced a smile and asked, \u201cYou really want to eat dragon and phoenix meat?\u201d</p><br/><p>His manner gave Tang Doudou a serious scare. If she said she really wanted to eat it, could it be that he would really go to get them?</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, of course\u2026\u201d Unexpectedly, before she even replied, Su Yi slapped his thigh and stood up. \u201cAs long as my family\u2019s disciple wants to eat it. Isn\u2019t it just dragon and phoenix meat? Master will go get them for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he finished speaking, he slipped off.</p><br/><p>And left Tang Doudou by herself to face the chaotic wind. It couldn\u2019t be that this guy had really gone to get dragon and phoenix meat?</p><br/><p>Before asking where he was going to get them, just this enthusiasm of his was abnormal!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t the proverbs say that those who are eagerly attentive for no reason, if they weren\u2019t traitors then they were thieves?</p><br/><p>This bastard definitely wanted to troll her somehow again!</p><br/><p>She was already bedridden, yet he still wasn\u2019t letting her off. Did he have any humanity!?</p><br/><p>But Tang Doudou could only resign herself to fate with this kind of master.</p><br/><p>The truth was, she had seriously misunderstood Su Yi. He had been blaming himself for failing to protect her so he wanted to get her something tasty in order to ease his guilt a little.</p><br/><p>However, when he got the things and brought them back to Tang Doudou\u2019s room, the two started staring at each other speechlessly again.</p><br/><p>Because Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t eat it right now ah!</p><br/><p>If she ate it, it would simply sit in her stomach and cause inflammation. It might even affect the healing of her injury, so she could only let the maids occasionally feed her a bite of porridge.</p><br/><p>Su Yi stayed to watch over her because he was too worried to leave. It was also a waste to throw away the food so, in the room as Tang Doudou swallowed the porridge with resentful eyes, Su Yi munched carefreely at the side. From time to time, he would even make satisfied smacks, causing Tang Doudou to itch to pounce on him and bite him to death.</p><br/><p>How could he, it was too much\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou chewed the bland rice in her mouth indignantly as if she was chewing Su Yi\u2019s flesh, causing Su Yi to be completely confused. He couldn\u2019t figure out why Tang Doudou was staring at him with that type of expression. With a slurp, he sucked the meat from the bone into his mouth. After wiping his mouth, he asked, \u201cI\u2019ll just get some for you once you get better. Stop staring at me, it\u2019s strangely spine-chilling\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At least he knew that it was spine-chilling!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently complained. However, she was still very curious about the meat in his hand. Could it really be dragon and phoenix flesh? Wasn\u2019t that too extraordinary?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to ask something, just ask. Don\u2019t keep looking at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou thanked the maid and indicated that she didn\u2019t want to eat anymore. The maid curtsied and withdrew. After the door closed, Tang Doudou finally asked curiously, \u201cWhat meat is that exactly?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

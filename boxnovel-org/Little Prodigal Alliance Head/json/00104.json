Thus, she carefully helped Baili Yu up until he was half reclining on the soft couch. Then, her line of sight landed on that pile of wine jars and bloody garments. She hastily found a place to hide them before sitting back down next to Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, why is that person still not here?\u201d asked Tang Doudou. They had waited for quite a while but nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Her words had just fallen when Baili Yu hooked his lips. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily sat up straight and tried to look as natural as possible. Natural\u2026 She was terrified of the person that was coming. It was not only become of that unimaginable scene she had seen while they were leaving, but also because of the injury on Baili Yu\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu seemed to have sensed her nervousness as he reached out and took her hand. Gently squeezing her palm, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wanted to ask something but she saw him open his eyes and look towards the carriage entrance with a languid expression. Soon afterward, he said, \u201cThe wind outside is cold, why not come in to talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked nervously at that pair of feet visible below the curtain. Her palms were already clammy. The opponent was someone that could kill without even blinking. If Baili Yu couldn\u2019t succeed in intimidating him, they will be done for. After all, there was nowhere for them to duck in this narrow carriage!</p><br/><p>Baili Yu had let go of her hand when that pair of feet appeared outside the curtain. They quietly waited for the person outside the carriage to enter.</p><br/><p>That pair of feet stood outside for a long time. When Tang Doudou had almost reached the end of her patience, the carriage curtain suddenly lifted and an extremely intimidating figure appeared inside the carriage.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s heartbeat abruptly sped up. However, when she got a clear look at the person in front of them, she instantly shot to her feet. In disbelief, she stammered, \u201cY-you? How could it be you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person that had come was wearing a jet-black robe which had a hood that covered his head. He wore an odd silver mask on his face which exposed only two deep-beyond-measure pupils and lips that were hooked in a nefarious smile. He was holding a lamp in his hand that was emitting a faint blue light. The light resembled those ghost fires in the night, it continuously leapt and swayed.</p><br/><p>It was Lou Qingyun, the bastard that caused her to almost perish in the sea of flames!</p><br/><p>Although he was wearing a mask, Tang Doudou had been able to recognize him in one glance due to his smile. The man in black in front of them was the fake Lou Qingyun that was selling lamps that day!T/N</p><br/><p>Afterwards, her gaze landed on that lamp. Wasn\u2019t that the lamp she had been yearning day and night for?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Alliance Head Li, we meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly are you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I forgot to introduce myself.\u201d The man in black chuckled softly before bowing towards Tang Doudou. \u201cThis one is Feng Yunhuan, the Right Protector of God Firmament Hall. Pleasure to meet you. In the future, I\u2019ll have to ask Alliance Head Li to please take care of me*!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201dPlease take care of me\u201d is more like \u2018give me advice/pointers\u2019. It\u2019s just something someone would say politely to someone older or more experienced like \u2018I\u2019m in your care\u2019 except you\u2019re not necessarily really \u2018in their care\u2019. I don\u2019t think Feng Yunhuan\u2019s part of the Alliance Head Residence. It\u2019d be such a twist if he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! Who cares if you\u2019re feng(wind) or yun(cloud)!? What exactly are you planning? God Firmament Hall? What the heck is that? Why haven\u2019t I ever heard of it!?\u201d Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t that scared anymore since he still counted as someone she knew. When she recalled how he almost killed her after she had so kindheartedly helped him, she felt a burst of anger rush to her head.</p><br/><p>Feng Yunhuan didn\u2019t seem to care about Tang Doudou\u2019s angry outburst. He straightened up from his bow and shifted his line of sight to Baili Yu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s unknown what method Baili Yu had utilized but his facial color had changed back to normal. He looked as if he hadn\u2019t gotten injured at all and his eyes contained his old imposingness. When Feng Yunhuan looked towards him, he met Feng Yunhuan\u2019s gaze and soon crushed the latter\u2019s imposing aura with his own.</p><br/><p>Apprehension also arose in Feng Yunhuan\u2019s heart when he saw Baili Yu\u2019s seemingly normal appearance. It must be known that he had not seen Baili Yu get injured with his own eyes. He had only heard his subordinates say that Baili Yu\u2019s back was bloody when he escaped the Absolute Death Array and that it looked like a serious injury. In addition, due to the fact that Baili Yu had tried to escape desperately, he had felt more certain that Baili Yu had gotten heavily wounded. That was why he hastily rushed over in hopes of being able to personally kill Baili Yu and take credit for it.</p><br/><p>However, Feng Yunhuan didn\u2019t dare to make a careless move in this current situation. He felt that it was possible Baili Yu had faked a heavy injury in order to lure him out. If that was really the case, he was the one in danger. It must be known that his martial arts really weren\u2019t that good, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to beat Ye Chuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili gongzi should know God Firmament Hall well, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if his guess was right. In any case, he\u2019ll refrain from making a move before the opponent does and observe the situation for now.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu saw that though Feng Yunhuan\u2019s expression had not changed, a lot of hesitation had appeared in his eyes. This person\u2019s excessive suspicions disorder is really severe. After Baili Yu silently labeled Feng Yunhuan with a tag, he shook his head and said, \u201cGod Firmament Hall? Never heard of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

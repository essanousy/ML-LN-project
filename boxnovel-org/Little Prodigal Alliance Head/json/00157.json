The shaking had also mysteriously stopped.</p><br/><p>She was much calmer now. Since it wasn\u2019t an earthquake, Jun Xin was probably fine. She decided that it was best for her to focus on getting out right now.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Jun Xin hadn\u2019t fallen in at all.</p><br/><p>It was also possible that this was a prank Jun Xin was pulling. With his inner strength, it probably wouldn\u2019t be hard for him to make the earth shake.</p><br/><p>The more Tang Doudou thought about it, the more likely it seemed that this was a prank. When she recalled how worried she had been, anger rushed up. \u201cStinkin\u2019 Jun Xin, just wait to see how this grandmama will sort you out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmama?\u201d Just as she was about to turn back, Jun Xin\u2019s low voice which contained that distinctive tone of unruliness suddenly came from the darkness. \u201cWho\u2019s the grandmama? You?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, as expected this was your prank!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would be so idle as to prank you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no then, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare for Jun Xin not to taunt her for her use of the word \u2018grandmama.\u2019 Tang Doudou felt that something was strange, but she followed behind Jun Xin without a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe disturbance earlier was due to that guy turning over. I was worried that it would wake up so I went down earlier and used anesthesia powder on it,\u201d explained Jun Xin quietly.</p><br/><p>The more Tang Doudou listened, the more she felt that the situation wasn\u2019t good. What exactly could cause such a huge disturbance from turning over?</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen your mouth. Take the antidote first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, can you tell me first what you\u2019re bringing me to see?\u201d Tang Doudou already had a vague idea of who the so-called \u2018guy\u2019 was, but she hoped she was wrong.</p><br/><p>In the darkness, Jun Xin said with a seemingly smiling tone, \u201cHaven\u2019t you already guessed? You still need me to explain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no, that thing is really dangerous!\u201d Having obtained confirmation, Tang Doudou hastily stopped and refused to continue walking. \u201cWe had better go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be able to hurt you as long as I\u2019m here.\u201d Jun Xin turned back and placed the antidote in Tang Doudou\u2019s hand. \u201cI need your help. Just help me once, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was a bit sad. Tang Doudou started feeling down just hearing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-how do I help you? Jun Xin, did something happen? Just say it! I\u2019ll definitely help you!\u201d Only then did Tang Doudou notice that something was off about Jun Xin and she immediately became worried.</p><br/><p>She had always thought of this Jun Xin, who always bickered with her, as a younger brother. Although he was a damned tsundere, he was very cute most of the time. When she recalled how they first met, she became even more concerned about Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>One could tell with a glance that Jun Xin was the type of person to keep his burdens buried deep in his heart without saying a word, so Tang Doudou didn\u2019t try to force him to speak. She was silent for a while before she said, \u201cI won\u2019t force you if you don\u2019t want to talk about it. In any case, if you need my help don\u2019t hesitate to look for me! You don\u2019t need to be polite with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she started groping her way forward, her earlier fear completely gone.</p><br/><p>Before she even took two steps, Jun Xin came to her side. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was at a loss with this sudden question. \u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you want to help me?\u201d Jun Xin\u2019s voice was very low, completely different from how he usually was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, isn\u2019t it obvious? Although you have a stinky mouth and always talk back to me, and have a bad temper, and is annoyingly tsundere and narcissistic, but that\u2019s fine ah. Who asked for us to be friends? Since we\u2019re friends, we naturally have to help each other, understand each other, and care for each other!\u201d Tang Doudou told Jun Xin everything in her heart as if it should be completely natural. She felt moved by her own words and wondered if Jun Xin was moved to the point he was crying.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, right after she finished speaking, Jun Xin\u2019s gloomy voice came from the darkness. \u201cWe\u2019re only friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Humph, this little kid seriously liked to aim for a foot when you gave him an inch!</p><br/><p>Being friends wasn\u2019t enough? It couldn\u2019t be that he wanted her to say things like sworn siblings?</p><br/><p>It was too embarrassing!</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, you\u2019re just an idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLIttle brat, can\u2019t you differentiate between good and bad? I\u2019m doing this all for you, how could you act like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t feel like wasting time arguing with her over this topic. He understood that the reason she was treating him like this was because this identity, Jun Xin, in her eyes was just a headstrong little kid.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t seem to like his Ming Mengxin identity much ah!</p><br/><p>Forget it. In any case, it wasn\u2019t the right time yet. Regardless of it was Jun Xin or Ming Mengxin, he\u2019ll simply act as needed with them!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Black Demonic Nightcrawler is the sacred bug of the Demonic Sect. You probably already know about this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The topic had switched too quickly and Tang Doudou was confused for a moment. \u201cWhat black\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, she recalled what the fake Lou Qingyun had once told her about the Black Demonic Nightcrawler. \u201cI know. That Xin Yue even said that after she refined the Demonic Nightcrawler, she would become undefeatable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin nodded in the darkness and continued, \u201cThis is the Black Demonic Nightcrawler that Xin Yue wanted to raise to maturity. As long as you dig out its heart during its maturing process and eat it, your martial arts power will increase explosively. After that, things like contending for control over the martial arts circles, being matchless under the heavens, would be a piece of cake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? It couldn\u2019t be that you want me to help you get that bug heart, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Other than explosively increasing martial arts power, that bug heart has another very important use. I also only discovered it recently when consulting ancient texts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other use?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin smiled as he declared, \u201cIt\u2019s the cure to a hundred poisons!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

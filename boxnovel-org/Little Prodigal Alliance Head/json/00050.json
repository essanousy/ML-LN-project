On the way, he shouted towards the people inside, \u201cThe Alliance Head has returned!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a burst of clamor in the residence. Everyone talked with liveliness as all kinds of noise bustled out. Moments later, it was brought under control by a familiar rough voice, \u201cHead out to welcome the Alliance Head\u2019s return!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Elder Yu\u2019s voice. Tang Doudou\u2019s lips hooked slightly, recalling what Li Hong said earlier.</p><br/><p>Who could have told from looking at Elder Yu, that coarse and unbridled type of person, that he was actually a wife-fearing wimp?</p><br/><p>From what Li Hong said, Elder Yu\u2019s wife was a barbarous, overbearing, and equally coarse woman. Elder Yu, who feared nothing in Heaven or Earth, feared this tigress the most.</p><br/><p>Ever since Madam Yu found out that the martial arts convention was being held at Rutaceae Pavilion, she had kicked up a fuss several times. One time she had even gone to make a disturbance where the Cloud City\u2019s Lord was, but in the end, she was expelled by the City Lord with one sentence. She couldn\u2019t do anything about the Cloud City\u2019s Lord, so she could only come back and kick up a fuss with Elder Yu again.</p><br/><p>Even though he was afraid of his wife, this martial arts convention was very important to Elder Yu, so someone put forward plans to help him secretly attend it. Originally this was a completely hush-hush matter, but it was disclosed by someone and the next day, Madam Yu ran over to the Alliance Head Residence to kick up a fuss and even gave Elder Yu a thorough beating.</p><br/><p>That tigress was fierce and violent, no one dared to step up to pull her away.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was actually Bai Feiyun who stood out to mediate this matter. But after that incident, Madam Yu continued to make a fuss, wanting to repudiate her husband*. In the end, she went back to her maternal home while crying.</p><br/><p>Lol, it sounds like Madam Yu\u2019s family is higher ranked than Elder Yu, otherwise how come he would keep staying with such a violent wife? Unless she\u2019s beautiful? Anyways, in ancient times, there was no divorce. What took the place of divorce was repudiation, which was more one-sided and usually from the man towards the wife. The wife is basically rejected and kicked out back to her maternal home which is a severe disgrace. Lol, and that\u2019s why Madam Yu must be of some high status to repudiate Elder Yu. Repudiate, btw, is the old English word for divorce, still used in non-Christian religions. Its most common meaning is \u201crefuse to accept or be associated with\u201d, but I\u2019ll be using it to represent the Chinese context I talked about.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu naturally refused to agree and also didn\u2019t return. He simply went ahead and stayed in the Alliance Head Residence.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin as she silently scorned Elder Yu, this grace-forgetting, ungrateful old bastard. Hell, Bai Feiyun ah, Bai Feiyun, why\u2019d you have to have such a good heart? Why didn\u2019t you just let that tigress beat this old bastard to death?</p><br/><p>Waste of effort. Now that was just great. You saved this old bastard and ended up getting yourself dragged into this mess.</p><br/><p>Just as she was lost in her random thoughts, a burst of people trampled out.</p><br/><p>There were both men and women. Leading them still was the fully bearded Elder Yu. He had a clear and bright smile on his face and his gaze swept towards Tang Doudou as if he was seeing an old friend for the first time in a long while. As for how fake that smile and that gaze was, it was as fake as described. If it were someone that didn\u2019t know the situation, they\u2019d really think he was meeting an old friend! But that faint purple mark on Elder Yu\u2019s old face would cause people to want to laugh when they saw it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head! You\u2019ve finally returned!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou blinked at Elder Yu and really did end up laughing. Only after quite a while did she reply with a surprised tone, \u201cAiyah, after numerous days of not seeing you, what happened to your face? Did you run into something when you got up at night? Tsk tsk, how can you be this careless? If there\u2019s not enough light at night, then just let the servants increase the lights ah. Even though I\u2019m not in the residence, you shouldn\u2019t treat yourself as a guest. If there\u2019s anything just instruct the servants!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she folded her hands behind her back and walked over, standing before the stiff-faced Elder Yu. She tilted her head slightly as she said to Li Hong who had followed behind her, \u201cLi Hong ah, pass down my instruction, remember to help Elder Yu increase the lighting at night, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Li Hong hurriedly cupped his fist and lowered his head as he responded, yet he couldn\u2019t hold back the smile at the corners of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Hearing Tang Doudou pitter-patter a torrential stream of words the moment she opened her mouth, the smile on Elder Yu\u2019s face turned stiff. Was he trying to display an initial show of strength upon arriving?</p><br/><p>But who was Elder Yu? How could he be defeated just by these few sentences from Tang Doudou?</p><br/><p>It was just that Elder Yu couldn\u2019t pull out that beaming expression anymore. With a slightly stern tone, Elder Yu asked, \u201cIs Alliance Head\u2019s return due to Bai gongzi\u2019s matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced over at him, then retrieved her gaze, \u201cOf course, but other than this matter I still have an even more important matter to resolve first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that there\u2019s still some matter even more important than saving Bai gongzi?\u201d Elder Yu asked in surprised.</p><br/><p>From the very start, Bai Feiyun\u2019s reputation was quite good in the Jianghu. In addition, he recently helped Tang Doudou deal with quite a few matters in the Alliance Head Residence so he had obtained even more public praise. Everyone saw that Tang Doudou had returned and thought it was for the sake of saving Bai Feiyun. But Tang Doudou actually said that there was an even more important matter that must be taken care of\u2026 it immediately attracted a lot of discontent from the people.</p><br/><p>But still, no one stood out to criticize Tang Doudou because they knew that the only entity that could save Bai Feiyun right now was Tang Doudou, who had the Alliance Head Command Tablet!</p><br/><p>These were all things everyone was well aware of. Naturally, Tang Doudou was also well aware, which was why she could say what she had earlier.</p><br/><p>And it was for the precise purpose of drawing out the question Elder Yu had asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Even though saving Bai gongzi is important, but before saving him we still have another matter to take care of first.\u201d Tang Doudou stood in front of everyone with her hands folded behind her back. The corners of her brow lifted, then she pointed towards the crowd, \u201cHey, you, come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person she pointed at was a short and skinny man with shrewd lips and monkey-like cheeks. His first reaction was to stare blankly. Then he looked left and right, before pointing at himself again, completely not understanding what Tang Doudou meant to do.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou saw him daze out and shouted loudly again: \u201cYes you! What are you looking around dilly-dallying for? Hurry up and step out here for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The short skinny man was startled by her holler and immediately reacted, squeezing out of the crowd. Then, he looked uneasily towards Tang Doudou with confusion, \u201cAlliance Head, what is it ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStand properly first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The short skinny man rubbed the back of his head and straightened his posture.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou circled around him several times while looking him up and down, then asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t know what she was asking this for, the short and skinny man still replied honestly: \u201cThis subordinate is Hou ZiT/N!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHou Zi? En, that\u2019s not bad. Hou Zi, how\u2019re your martial arts?\u201d Tang Doudou rubbed her chin, then asked.</p><br/><p>Hou Zi continued to scratch his head. Matched with that appearance of his, he was seriously barely any different from a real monkey, just lacking a little in cleverness. This made Tang Doudou feel a little regretful. Earlier when she saw his appearance, she thought he\u2019d be quite intelligent.</p><br/><p>Seeing the disappointment slip through Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes, Hou Zi\u2019s face turned slightly red and he stammered: \u201cI-I\u2019m a top quality expert, my martial arts isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he asked probingly: \u201cDoes Alliance Head have some task for this subordinate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after he finished speaking, he started getting emotional on his own. He had been in this Alliance Head Residence for three years, but because his appearance wasn\u2019t appealing enough, he has never been entrusted with anything significant. But the new Alliance Head had picked him out the moment he returned, how could he not be moved?</p><br/><p>\u201cA top quality expert?\u201d What ghost of a thing is that?T/N2 Tang Doudou smacked her lips, subconsciously glancing towards the Qing Yin who was standing not that far away and saw her imperceptibly nod.</p><br/><p>So Tang Doudou returned her gaze toHou Zi and unhurriedly said: \u201cEn, there is a task for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Yu interjected and exhorted: \u201cEven though Hou Zi is a top quality expert, he doesn\u2019t have enough experience in handling affairs. Alliance Head must consider things properly ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The most important point was, Hou Zi was not one of his people!</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t know what task it was that Tang Doudou was planning to hand down, as long as it was one of his people he\u2019d be able to worry less.</p><br/><p>The excitement on Hou Zi\u2019s face immediately froze as he looked worriedly towards Tang Doudou. What Elder Yu said wasn\u2019t wrong, his ability to handle affairs truly couldn\u2019t measure up to others. As he thought about it, a helpless expression appeared in his eyes. Afraid his turn won\u2019t come around again this time!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gave a long \u2018oh\u2019 and rubbed her chin. Then she asked for guidance from Elder Yu with a very earnest expression, \u201cThen who does Elder Yu believe to be more suitable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Yu hummed for quite a while, appearing to be giving the matter great consideration, thinking things through over and over again before slowly replying, \u201cThen it should be Syndicate Leader Xu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSyndicate Leader Xu?\u201d Tang Doudou immediately thought of those familiar little eyes, \u201cThe Syndicate Leader Xu that came to find me today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s him. Back when Bai gongzi was still here, Syndicate Leader Xu would often help Bai gongzi with numerous matters both big and small, and Bai gongzi was quite satisfied with all of his work!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou asked Hou Zi instead.</p><br/><p>Unwillingness appeared in Hou Zi\u2019s eyes. If it was someone else, he could still be convinced to accept it! But this Syndicate Leader Xu, who doesn\u2019t know that he was an all-take-and-no-give absolutely disgraceful bastard who just uses his position to kick people around!? The matters that he helped Bai gongzi with, he had relied on Elder Yu as a support and ordered them to complete them for him.</p><br/><p>Bai gongzi was also clear about that matter, it was just that he didn\u2019t feel like picking about the details. After all, everyone was well aware of whom Syndicate Leader Xu was affiliated with.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, this subordinate\u2019s ability does not lose to Syndicate Leader Xu!\u201d Hou Zi felt a continuous struggle in his heart, but in the end resolved to chance a gamble!</p><br/><p>Seeing his firm and resolute expression, Tang Doudou also formed a plan. But on the surface, she pulled out a troubled expression and said, \u201cBut this matter truly is very difficult ah, from the looks of you, I\u2019m afraid you wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. Why not just let Syndicate Leader Xu take care of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hou Zi\u2019s expression stiffened and disappointment showed up on his face. This Alliance Head amounted to no more than this, not even being able to tell the fact that Syndicate Leader Xu was one of Elder Yu\u2019s people. It looked like he won\u2019t be able to continue to stay in this Alliance Head Residence. Otherwise, he would be so depressed all the time that his all his backbone would wear down.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yu, where is this Syndicate Leader Xu right now? How come I don\u2019t see him?\u201d She looked closely at the crowd but didn\u2019t discover where Syndicate Leader Xu was. So Tang Doudou retrieved her gaze to enquire Elder Yu.</p><br/><p>Only then did Elder Yu recall that Syndicate Leader Xu seemed to have gone to Plum Garden and still hadn\u2019t returned yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that he hasn\u2019t returned yet?\u201d Tang Doudou then immediately clapped her hands as if she had just thought of something, and said towards Qing Yin, \u201cQing Yin, did we forget to call Syndicate Leader Xu when we left? He couldn\u2019t be still waiting in Plum Garden for us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did everyone notice Qing Yin, who was standing not far away. They saw her delicate and pleasant features which couldn\u2019t cover up that quiet and exquisite aura of hers. Quite a few people had seen her before that day at the martial arts convention, so this time, they were able to recognize her with one glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is Lady Qing Yin ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she the senior maid that serves at Baili Yu\u2019s side? Why did she also come to Alliance Head Residence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows ah? But based on the way Alliance Head looks at her, there seems to be some ambiguity ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin seemed to not have heard any of those comments and curtsied towards Tang Doudou as she replied: \u201cGongzi, be at ease. Syndicate Leader Xu will probably arrive soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lifted her brows, \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Plum Garden has never detained a guest past an hour. Before we left, Syndicate Leader Xu had already been asked to leave. Calculating the distance and the time, he should already have returned long ago. For him to be late in returning, there must have been a matter delaying him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so as well.\u201d Elder Yu didn\u2019t know where Syndicate Leader Xu had run off to at this time either and silently cursed before continuing, \u201cSince Syndicate Leader Xu isn\u2019t here, if Alliance Head doesn\u2019t want to wait, then why don\u2019t we first discuss Bai gongzi\u2019s matter before dealing with this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shook her head, distressed, \u201cThat\u2019s out of the question, this matter must be handled first. Otherwise others will say I\u2019m not fair!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Yu incessantly cursed in his heart. She was dragging this on back and forth, it couldn\u2019t be that she didn\u2019t want to save Bai Feiyun?</p><br/><p>If it was really like this, didn\u2019t he just waste these couple days of effort?</p><br/><p>It must be known that the Demonic Sect had captured Bai Feiyun, but it was just that. They didn\u2019t dare to really do anything to Bai Feiyun!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

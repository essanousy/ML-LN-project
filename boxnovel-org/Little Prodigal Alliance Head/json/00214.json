When she passed by Feng Wu, she sent over a gaze filled with silent bitterness. \u201cBig Sis Feng Wu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should go. He came here to come get you.\u201d Feng Wu said with a slight smile as she took out a brocade pouch and placed it in Tang Doudou\u2019s palm. \u201cIn your time of greatest need, open the pouch. I have to go back to Mist City now. You should talk to your master properly; don\u2019t make him angry again. When you encounter things, make sure to take time to think. Don\u2019t act too rashly. And come to Mist City to play when you have time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t expected that Feng Wu was about to leave and was alarmed to hear this. After last night, she had already started thinking of Feng Wu as a true older sister and as someone she could rely on, yet in the blink of an eye they were going to part again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that urgent? Can\u2019t you stay a couple more days? Big Sister Feng Wu, I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Wu shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent, so I have to go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no banquets in the world that do not end. Remember, in the future don\u2019t casually cry your eyes out anymore. Become a strong young lady!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Tang Doudou really didn\u2019t want Feng Wu to leave, she knew that Feng Wu was right. There were no banquets in the world that didn\u2019t end. She didn\u2019t ask her to stay anymore and simply gave her a big hug. \u201cEn, I will!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Wu patted her head before gently pushing her away. \u201cYou should hurry and head out, otherwise your master will get irritated and explode again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after she spoke, the sound of Su Yi\u2019s impatient shout came from outside. \u201cWhat are you still dawdling for? Can\u2019t you hurry up!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cC-coming!\u201d replied Tang Doudou. She waved towards Feng Wu and said, \u201cBig Sister Feng Wu, I\u2019ll definitely go back to visit you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she turned around and ran out of the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s leaving?\u201d Despite being completely annoyed just a moment earlier, when Su Yi saw Tang Doudou come out he hastily walked over to her and asked her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at him in surprise and asked, puzzled, \u201cBig Sis Feng Wu didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the type that never discusses anything with anyone before she makes a decision. Even if it\u2019s a matter as heavy as the sky, she insists on bearing it herself. She\u2019s a stinkin\u2019 woman who never asks for help!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s tone was very annoyed but also filled with worry. However, he didn\u2019t look towards the courtyard, seeming to know that Feng Wu had already left.</p><br/><p>He still seemed very worried though, since he glanced at Tang Doudou and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to Baili Yu\u2019s place first. The fact that she\u2019s rushing back to Mist City definitely means that something bad has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, he looked around. When he didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary, he lowered his voice and said, \u201cYesterday\u2019s plan managed to just barely work out due to that little fox\u2019s cooperation. For the time being, that little fox is still your fiance.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou heard this, for some reason she felt very moved. He really was, as Feng Wu had said, worried about her suddenly running off and encountering danger. He hadn\u2019t been angry because she had almost caused his plan to fail.</p><br/><p>Right now Su Yi didn\u2019t have the presence of mind to notice that she was moved. After briefly telling her about the earlier events, he sent her to the inn that Baili Yu was staying at.</p><br/><p>He left a sentence of, \u201cgo look for the little fox yourself!\u201d then disappeared off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlli-, Young City Lord?\u201d Unexpectedly, the person who was guarding the door was Ye Chuan whom she hadn\u2019t seen in a very long time. When he saw Tang Doudou in female garments, his expression became a little unnatural.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was currently quite depressed so she didn\u2019t pay attention to how strange he was acting. She asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s your family\u2019s master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan pointed towards the second floor of Propitious Clouds Inn. \u201cMaster is resting up there. He gave instructions that if it was Young City Lord, to let you head up to find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou suddenly recalled Jun Xin and his injury, so she asked, \u201cDid Jun Xin come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin was mentioned, Ye Chuan\u2019s expression became even more unnatural. It was awkward to the point that even Tang Doudou, despite her insensitivity, noticed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan lowered his gaze and tried to avoid answering the question. \u201cYoung Master Jun doesn\u2019t live here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask about that.\u201d She stared at Ye Chuan and discovered that his expression was very stiff. She couldn\u2019t help but be curious about the reason for it. Could it be that he had gotten into some sort of argument with Jun Xin?</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan\u2019s attitude towards her had improved somewhat before, but now it seemed to have return to what it was like originally.</p><br/><p>Just as she was wondering about the reason why, Ye Chuan turned aside and said stiffly, \u201cYoung City Lord, you had better go up yourself to ask Master about it. Ye Chuan is only a servant and knows nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he looked into the distance, ignoring Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>It was seriously a bit baffling ah!</p><br/><p>Aiy, whatever. She should go find the big evil spirit first, then ask about what was going on with Ye Chuan!</p><br/><p>She turned and started walking towards Propitious Clouds Inn. Pushing open the door, she found that the inside of the inn was cleaned up quite nicely. Originally, the lower floor was a dining hall, but all the tables and stools had been moved out of it. It was so empty \u2013 wonder if the people that stayed here would feel scared upon seeing it at night?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked towards the second floor and found that there wasn\u2019t a single person in the inn.</p><br/><p>She quietly walked up the stairs. When she saw that there were a ton of doors in the hallway, she wanted to cry. Why didn\u2019t she ask which room he was in earlier?</p><br/><p>How stupid!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

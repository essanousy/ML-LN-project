The sound of the drizzling rain continued as the sky gradually darkened. Before she knew it, she had drifted off to sleep while meditating. When she shifted sleepily, she suddenly sat back up in realization. She glanced outside. Seeing that the sky was already turning dark, she slapped herself for almost forgetting about the main goal.</p><br/><p>Achoo!</p><br/><p>Oh no, she seemed to have a slight cold. Hopefully it wouldn\u2019t get in the way of what she needed to do.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to head out, she heard urgent footsteps approach.</p><br/><p>She looked around helplessly, then ran to hide behind the Buddha statue. One step after she hid herself, the people had entered the temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to hurry but you wouldn\u2019t listen. Now this is just great, we have no choice but to stay in this temple for tonight!\u201d An irritated-sounding voice appeared. Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes whirled. The world sure was small. She had actually encountered that brat, Xiao Yi, again!</p><br/><p>From the sounds of the footsteps and Xiao Yi\u2019s words, there was probably one more person. If her guess wasn\u2019t wrong, it was probably Xiao Siyuan.</p><br/><p>As she had expected, right after Xiao Yi said that, Xiao Siyuan\u2019s helpless and much more moderate voice appeared. \u201cThat grandma was very old. If we hadn\u2019t helped her back, she definitely would\u2019ve met with a mishap in this weather.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever! In any case, you\u2019ll always be able to argue back with something no matter what I say!\u201d responded Xiao Yi, still annoyed. \u201cI\u2019m going to go make a fire. You should get changed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou poked out her head and saw that Xiao Siyuan just smiled without saying anything. He then took off his outer garments to wring them dry as he looked around the temple. However, since it was dark, he didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Xiao Yi had already started throwing some dry wood in a pile. Following that, he picked up a bunch of straw, lit them with a rolled torch, and threw them onto the pile of wood.</p><br/><p>Although this temple was quite drafty, the roof was strong and didn\u2019t leak. These wood had been in the temple for countless years and had long dried out completely, so they easily caught the flames.</p><br/><p>As the warm flames leapt up, Xiao Siyuan rubbed his hands, then swiftly lifted a bamboo pole and hung his wet clothes on it. \u201cAh Yi, you should take your clothes off too!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clearly something said out of good intentions, but Xiao Yi\u2019s face immediately turned dark. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Siyuan replied with a helpless tone. \u201cYou\u2019ll catch a chill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a woman, as if I\u2019m that delicate!\u201d Xiao Yi didn\u2019t agree and just sat down next to the fire. He untied a canteen from his waist, twisted it open, and took a large swig. \u201cRefreshing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Siyuan stared at his canteen with a frown. \u201cWhy are you drinking alcohol again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt warms you up. Have some?\u201d Xiao Yi laughed mischievously as he waved the canteen at Xiao Siyuan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Siyuan declined. \u201cThe 382th rule of the Xiao family is that alcohol is prohibited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi edged over with a smirk. \u201cThe 599th rule of the Xiao family: keeping violations secret is a first degree offense! You often see me drink. Why don\u2019t you report me to the elders?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Siyuan stiffen. He was just about to reply with something when a loud \u2018achoo\u2019 interrupted him.</p><br/><p>The two\u2019s expression turned serious and they shared a quick glance before simultaneously moving towards the Buddha statue.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was covering her mouth nervously even as she rolled her eyes. It was seriously wonderful timing. She could\u2019ve sneezed at any time, but it just had to end up at this time. Wasn\u2019t this completely demanding her life?</p><br/><p>Originally, she had been planning to sneak away once Xiao Yi and Xiao Siyuan fell asleep. Although Xiao Siyuan seemed pretty reasonable, Xiao Yi\u2019s temper was nowhere as good. He probably still held a grudge against her about that incident last time. There was no one else around in the temple, so there was no guarantee that Xiao Yi wouldn\u2019t attack her out of anger when he saw her. Based on how meek Xiao Siyuan looked, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to stop Xiao Yi.</p><br/><p>As the two got even closer, Tang Doudou retreated backwards in a panic. However, after a few steps, she already hit the cold wall. There was nowhere left to hide.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d shouted Xiao Yi as they came to a stop about a meter away from the statue.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou opened her mouth silently. After a moment of thought, she timidly stuck her head out. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, it had already been a month, so Xiao Yi with his careless personality had already forgotten about this aunt. \u201cWho are you? Why were you hiding so sneakily behind the Buddha statue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Siyuan\u2019s expression on the other hand showed that he remembered who Tang Doudou was. However, he didn\u2019t bring it up and just extended a hand to stop Xiao Yi. \u201cThis aunt is probably here to take shelter from the rain as well. Don\u2019t be so fierce, you\u2019ll scare this elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi humphed coldly. \u201cWho would hide behind the Buddha statue to take shelter from the rain? She clearly had bad intentions!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily refuted. \u201cN-no, that\u2019s not it. I heard people coming and I was worried it would be bandits, that\u2019s why I hid behind the statue. If you don\u2019t believe me, look over there. I was the one that set that up. I was originally going to rest there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi didn\u2019t move but he did glance over. When he saw that there were traces of a person lying on the straw over there, the guarded expression in his eyes lessened a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you that this aunt isn\u2019t a bad person.\u201d Xiao Siyuan walked towards the statue with a smile. \u201cI heard you sneeze earlier, you must be cold. If you don\u2019t mind, you can warm yourself up near the fire with us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi glowered at him. \u201cI don\u2019t agree!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yi, you\u2019re forgetting the family rules again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t agree. I don\u2019t want to sit together with some stinkin\u2019 old woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not negotiating. If you feel like my behavior is wrong, then just tell on me to the Elders!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Siyuan felt helpless when faced with Xiao Yi\u2019s behavior. He was just about to try persuading Xiao Yi again when Tang Doudou said, \u201cMany thanks for your good intentions, but I\u2019ve already rested. I just ended up oversleeping a little. It\u2019s already dark, so if I don\u2019t hurry back, my family will worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, you\u2019re someone of Huai City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded with a laugh. \u201cMy maternal family is from Huai City. I came this time to visit relatives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou could tell from Xiao Siyuan\u2019s words that he knew who she was. The reason he asked this was also very clear.</p><br/><p>He was probing her.</p><br/><p>After she said that, Xiao Siyuan was silent for a while. He glanced outside, then said, \u201cAunt, it\u2019s probably not very safe to head back to the city this late at night. Why don\u2019t I walk you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? When I told you to hurry up so that we can get to the city, you spouted a bunch of useless drivel at me, but now, for a random old woman, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yi, you won\u2019t let her warm up by the fire and you won\u2019t let me send her back home either. How am I supposed to rest easy if something happens to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine fine, you\u2019re just an amazingly good person and I\u2019m a bad person, alright?\u201d Xiao Yi could hear slight anger in Xiao Siyuan\u2019s words, so he became unhappy as well. After saying that sarcastically, he plopped himself down next to the fire. \u201cIf you want to send her, just do it. Do whatever you want! It\u2019s none of my business anyways!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Siyuan looked unhappy with Xiao Yi\u2019s reaction as well, but he didn\u2019t bother to argue and just said to Tang Doudou, \u201cAunt, let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll see you to the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Tang Doudou wanted to reject his offer. However, then her gaze flickered and she walked out with Xiao Siyuan without a word.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi watched as the two left, then angrily kicked the fire as he grumbled, \u201cIf you want to court death, then just go! Humph, it\u2019s none of my business! I don\u2019t care!\u201d</p><br/><p>The woodpile was soon scattered by his stomping and the temple became a lot dimmer.</p><br/><p>Although he said he wouldn\u2019t care, he still couldn\u2019t help but worry. He stomped on the almost extinguished fire again, then remarked angrily, \u201cFine! Xiao Yi, I guess I owe you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside, the rain had already lessened up a lot, but it still felt cold as it fell on one\u2019s face. The coiling black clouds above in the night showed no signs of dispersing. There would probably be another large storm tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Xiao Siyuan walked on the small road, one behind the other. There were only a few birds in the drenched old trees near the road.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, why isn\u2019t the uncle with you?\u201d asked Xiao Siyuan after they walked silently for a while.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

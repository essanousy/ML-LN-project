Tang Doudou returned to her senses. Lifting her eyes to look towards Bai Feiyun, she seemed to see deep concern flash through his eyes, but after rubbing her eyes it was gone. She muttered a little, silently debating with herself\u2026 should she make a dark move and ruthlessly ravage this delicate boy before escaping without a trace?</p><br/><p>After considering it three more times, Tang Doudou firmly abandoned the disaster-courting idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel a bit uncomfortable, like my whole body has no strength. My head feels swollen, it feels like there\u2019s some things I can\u2019t recall.\u201d For lack of a better option, Tang Doudou could only haul out the essential survival skill for transmigration, feign amnesia!</p><br/><p>Of course she couldn\u2019t have possibly lost her memories out of nowhere so she continued under Bai Feiyun\u2019s suspicious gaze. \u201cJust then there were a lot of black-clothed men that attacked me. With great difficulty, I managed to repel them, but by the time I was able to respond I had already forgotten who I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing, she looked with a blank expression towards Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmnesia?\u201d A trace of a wave finally appeared on Bai Feiyun\u2019s calm and collected face. \u201cGive me your hand, let me take a look for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t be a doctor, right!?</p><br/><p>Based on the personality traits of the ancients, men that floated about wearing white clothes everyday like a ten-thousand-year-old little white lotus is one of two things: either he\u2019s a genius doctor that not a speck of dust can touch, or he\u2019s a little pompous show-off trying to be cool.</p><br/><p>This handsome in front of her, his temperament didn\u2019t seem common so he should be one of the former.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t be that unlucky, right? Randomly floundering about a little in a panic and she knocked up against the muzzle of a gun?</p><br/><p>Gaping then closing her mouth, Tang Doudou moved closer to Bai Feiyun\u2019s front.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can even detect amnesia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter trying you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun extended his hand. Under the moonlight, his slender fingers were transparent like jade.</p><br/><p>The words were already said to here, if she refused again it might arouse his suspicion. And so, Tang Doudou could only reluctantly extend her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cTendons Softening Powder?\u201d Bai Feiyun had only slightly touched Tang Doudou\u2019s wrist when his brows knitted.</p><br/><p>What thingie is Tendons Softening Powder?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou encountered people from the Demonic Sect?\u201d Bai Feiyun asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTendons Softening Powder doesn\u2019t have the ability to cause amnesia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a variation, I really don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had made up her mind to feign amnesia, yet her gaze kept sweeping over Bai Feiyun\u2019s face from time to time. \u201cHey, what\u2019s your name? Are we really familiar with each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tendons Softening Powder can\u2019t cause amnesia, but another sort of poison was actually fatal enough to take your life.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s eyes were dark. Looking at the perfectly intact Li Xueyi in front of him, he thought it through carefully before retracting his hand. \u201cYou really don\u2019t remember anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m lying I\u2019m a dog!\u201d Tang Doudou humphed.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yu won\u2019t permit a person who lost their memories to become the Alliance Head.\u201d Bai Feiyun muttered to himself for a while. Just as he wanted to continue speaking, his hands were tightly grabbed by someone.</p><br/><p>Without needing to say it, he still knew who it was that grabbed his hand.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Bai Yunfei looked towards Tang Doudou. In the dark night a pair of eyes were particularly bright.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man ah, since they aren\u2019t willing, then I won\u2019t persistently pester and insist on taking that position. Look at you ah! Handsome and confident with extraordinary elegance and high martial arts skills, with just a look people can tell you\u2019re a diamond in the rough. Not to mention, in addition, there\u2019s that domineering air of a king that you give off all the time! Gee, I feel that you\u2019re the most suitable to become the Alliance Head!\u201d Tang Doudou walked over and vigorously patted Bai Feiyun\u2019s shoulder, continuing with meaningful and heartfelt words. \u201cSo I\u2019ve decided, I will give the Alliance Head Command Tablet to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>This burst of words made Bai Feiyun\u2019s brows jump and jump up again. The gaze he directed towards became filled with more and more puzzlement.</p><br/><p>Even if you lost your memories, a person\u2019s temperament still couldn\u2019t possibly change this much.</p><br/><p>That type of poison, there is still no one in the world that is said to be able to cure it, yet against all reason he\u2019s perfectly undamaged and intact standing in front of him. The poison is in him, yet it didn\u2019t seem to show the slightest bit.</p><br/><p>Who in the world was he?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

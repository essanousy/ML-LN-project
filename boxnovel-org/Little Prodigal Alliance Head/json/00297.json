She immediately set down what she was currently working on to follow Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Lady Doudou has gotten married?\u201d Qing Yin was even more surprised when she saw Tang Doudou. When she saw how ragged her appearance was, her eyes filled with confusion. \u201cYoung Master Jun? What happened to Lady Doudou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d Jun Xin\u2019s expression turned strange. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin was annoyed when Jun Xin became fixated on the less important question, but she didn\u2019t dare to neglect a master\u2019s question and explained patiently, \u201cReplying Young Master Jun, Lady Doudou is wearing a bridal dress. Although the outer garment is already gone, the inner garments are still distinctive enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was already a complicated situation from the start. This detail just added more questions.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin gloomily waved his hand and said, \u201cAlright, I got it. Help her wash up and change her into more comfortable clothes. Look after her well, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Young Master Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Jun Xin left, Qing Yin heaved a sigh and murmured, \u201cLi gongzi, Lady Doudou\u2026 Why couldn\u2019t you just stay in Plum Garden contently? You\u2019re always getting yourself hurt. Even if my heart doesn\u2019t ache, could it be that Master\u2019s heart doesn\u2019t ache? Haaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After muttering a bit, she got up to get the things for helping Tang Doudou wash up.</p><br/><p>Right after she left, an uninvited guest entered the room.</p><br/><p>The person was dressed in black, with a black cloth mask covering his features.</p><br/><p>He walked to the head of the bed and examined Tang Doudou with his emotionless gaze before sitting down next to the bed. He reached out softly to touch her lips longingly.</p><br/><p>Su Yi had really been too careless with his arrangements. Although Baili Yiling was a very clever and intelligent girl, she was still inexperienced and hadn\u2019t seen much of the world. In addition, she didn\u2019t have very good martial arts. If he hadn\u2019t been watching over them from the shadows and dealing with the threats for them, they probably wouldn\u2019t have made it back to Plum Garden.</p><br/><p>Then he laughed at himself. Su Yi probably knew that he would be following.</p><br/><p>He kept his eyes fixed on Tang Doudou\u2019s face, as if to memorize her features, as he silently took out a jade vial.</p><br/><p>He clutched the vial tightly as hesitation flashed across his face.</p><br/><p>After a few moments, he reached out to lift Tang Doudou\u2019s chin gently and applied a little force to part her lips. Then he popped the top off the vial and poured its contents into her mouth before releasing her and standing back up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come find you once you get better.\u201d Then he left as soundlessly as he had arrived.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin pushed open the door and had the servants carry in the bathtub and the tubs of water. After the bath was prepared, she had everyone withdraw, then started washing Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin lay on a roof and spaced out while staring at the leaves and birds overhead.</p><br/><p>The doctor inside the room was examining Baili Yiling for injuries. After a while, the doctor shook his head and said, \u201cShe\u2019s just out of energy from over exertion. After resting for a few days with proper meals, she\u2019ll recover. I\u2019ll write two prescriptions to aid her recovery, remember to have her take them as directed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Doctor Li. Please come this way to the accounts office for us to pay the bill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your trouble, Steward.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was the sound of footsteps as the servant and doctor walked out of the room. However, before the door closed, the servant cried out in surprise, \u201cYoung Master Jun?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor hastily saluted Jun Xin as well. \u201cGreetings, Young Master Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be so polite, Doctor Li,\u201d replied Jun Xin before he stated his purpose. \u201cDoctor Li, I wish to have the person inside wake up immediately. Is there a way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Li looked down and replied respectfully, \u201cShe\u2019s not ill, she\u2019s only fainted, so she should wake up on her own soon. At that time, just give her some hot porridge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he walked past the two and entered the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor Li, this way please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling had woken up before Jun Xin even got to her room.</p><br/><p>When she saw Jun Xin coming in, she sat up in the bed and said weakly, \u201cI want to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already instructed the servants.\u201d Jun Xin frowned as he stopped near the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re Baili Yiling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are!\u201d Jun Xin chuckled. \u201cWith those eyes, even if you\u2019re not, you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling didn\u2019t have much strength left so she didn\u2019t bother arguing with him and just asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Sister-in-Law?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sister-in-law I carried back. Has she woken up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t gotten married with Baili Yu yet. Aren\u2019t you jumping the gun by calling her sister-in-law?\u201d Jun Xin said mildly with an unreadable expression.</p><br/><p>However, before he even finished his words, Baili Yiling interrupted with a laugh. She said in a slightly mocking tone, \u201cYoung Master Jun probably still hasn\u2019t heard the news? Not only has my sister-in-law gotten married with my big brother, she is already pregnant with my brother\u2019s child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! You think I\u2019ll believe your words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling didn\u2019t try to persuade him and just lay back down on the bed. \u201cIf Sister-in-Law still hasn\u2019t woken up, then I\u2019ll have to ask Young Master Jun to invite Bai Feiyun over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInvite him over for what?\u201d Jun Xin wasn\u2019t in a hurry either because he felt that he would be able to get answers once Tang Doudou woke up.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling\u2019s words were definitely for the sake of getting him back for calling her a beggar earlier.</p><br/><p>As for whether Tang Doudou had gotten married and was pregnant or not, did it matter?</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t they things that would happen sooner or later?</p><br/><p>But how come, even though he had already accepted it, his heart still felt so painful that it was hard to breathe?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

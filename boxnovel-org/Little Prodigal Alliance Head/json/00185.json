Hurry up and open the door! You have the face to go out and blindly blabble, but don\u2019t have to face to come out and see me? You damned old bastard!\u201d When Tang Doudou woke up and found out that she was already in Cloud City, she was infuriated. Following that, she learned about the later news. Each one made her so angry she almost passed out again. Su Yi had definitely drank fake wine, he actually exposed her female identity like this!</p><br/><p>She knocked so hard, but all that came after a pause was Su Yi\u2019s languid voice. \u201cIt\u2019s so early in the morning, can\u2019t you let people sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou freaking did something like that and you still want to sleep!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, if you\u2019re so violent how will you get married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether I get married or not is none of your business. Hurry up and open the door, stop trying to distract me by changing the topic!\u201d She continued pounding on the door in front of her. She was currently so depressed that she didn\u2019t even have the mood to enjoy the wonderful scenery outside.</p><br/><p>Su Yi laughed evilly. \u201cTwo more days. Another two days at most, alright? I\u2019ll open the door then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! Liar. That\u2019s what you said two days ago! Don\u2019t try to use this excuse to fob me off again! I heard that people have already come to Cloud City. If you don\u2019t come out and settle this for me, I\u2019ll tear apart this City Lord Residence of yours and sell it!\u201d This bastard Su Yi had thrown her to Cang Baicao right after bringing her back, and then went to the City Lord Residence to publicly announce several things. When she woke up several days later and learned about all of this from Cang Baicao, she almost got angered to death.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t see him come out and help a single time when she was in trouble, yet he always came and brought her a ton of trouble whenever he felt bored. It was seriously hateful!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, this time is true. Actually, I\u2019ve gotten injured. These few days I\u2019ve been nursing my injury\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you trying to fool!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hell, she even heard that he went out to stroll around the pleasure quarters yesterday. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she was held up by some matters, she would have already gone there to catch him.</p><br/><p>When Su Yi heard that she was still angry, he could only force a laugh and try to explain. \u201cI\u2019m doing all this for your own good. You\u2019ve been making your way in the world outside these past years and have long gotten past the suitable age for marriage. If you delay it any longer, you might really not be able to get married. Moreover, it\u2019s not like you can pretend to be a man your entire life, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course she wanted to restore her female identity, but she definitely hadn\u2019t wanted to restore it like this. Moreover, Su Yi, this shameless guy, was clearly doing this to troll Baili Yu!</p><br/><p>With regards to money, who in this world had more money than Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>As for rare treasures, what rare treasures couldn\u2019t be bought by money? Moreover, more than half of the rare treasures in the world already belonged to Baili Yu\u2019s Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce.</p><br/><p>As for character, who was a better person than Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>He had money, power, influence, and looks. He was the husband that ten hundred thousand unmarried girls yearned for!</p><br/><p>In addition, he had become that worn out because he had been searching for her so desperately. That showed that he truly loved her with all his heart!</p><br/><p>Such a good man actually belonged to her. No matter what she couldn\u2019t let Su Yi troll him! She was the only one allowed to troll him!</p><br/><p>There was also the fact that she hadn\u2019t even been able to deal with all the Alliance Head Residence matters, yet this guy actually threw the entire Cloud City to her. It was practically demanding her old life!</p><br/><p>When she didn\u2019t speak for a long time, Su Yi thought she was moved by his words and continued, \u201cYou see, I\u2019ve gotten old as well and I have no disciples other than you. Sooner or later this seat of City Lord will belong to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you ended up losing your memories due to the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance and became all dumb, you don\u2019t know how to manage Cloud City at all. How am I supposed to rest easy if I don\u2019t find you a good husband!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, that Baili Yu doesn\u2019t have good intentions from the start. You can\u2019t allow yourself to be fooled by his looks.\u201d Perhaps he recalled that the guy in question, Baili Yu, actually hadn\u2019t done anything bad to Tang Doudou. On the contrary, that guy had done a lot for Tang Doudou, going as far to neglect his Hoarfrost Poison to help her, so Su Yi said in supplement, \u201cIf you seriously like that fox, why don\u2019t you take this chance to test him a little? Isn\u2019t it a very good opportunity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you understand how considerate I\u2019m being?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

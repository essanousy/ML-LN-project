If I die, you\u2019ll never be able to obtain those secrets again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know who exactly you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know why you got poisoned with the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, and why you suddenly disappeared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd why you would become like you currently are now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s Baili Yu, aren\u2019t you worried about his Hoarfrost Poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no change in Tang Doudou\u2019s expression, but she stopped tightening her hands. Her ice blue eyes swept over him indifferently before becoming filled with strong bloodthirst. \u201cYou talk too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Moru coughed out a mouthful of black blood. \u201cAs expected of a child of the Xuanyuan tribe, the reputation is not in vain!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, he turned into black smoke before recondensing at a distant place.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou charged over and crushed Shen Moru who still hadn\u2019t fully condensed under her foot. \u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Doudou\u2026\u201d Just as she was increasing her strength to crush Shen Moru\u2019s skull, a gentle voice suddenly appeared in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d She looked around but couldn\u2019t see anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in searching, you won\u2019t be able to see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Tang Doudou was very curious. Ever since she abruptly woke up earlier, the only voice she had been able to hear was Shen Moru\u2019s. She hadn\u2019t been able to hear or see anything else.</p><br/><p>So it was hard not to be curious about this voice that had suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I want? Won\u2019t you know once you come take a look?\u201d said that voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Tang Doudou took a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalk towards the left, all the way forward\u2026\u201d That voice seemed to contain some sort of demonic compelling force. Although she didn\u2019t want to go in the direction he gave, her legs started moving in that direction without her command.</p><br/><p>Shen Moru got up from the ground and watched Tang Doudou\u2019s strange behavior with surprise in his eyes. A dagger appeared in his hand, but before he could act, a hand pressed against his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Moru recognized this voice, so he didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about getting retribution for doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid, so why should I fear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does everyone seem to like asking me this?\u201d That person laughed lightly. \u201cIf you want to know, why don\u2019t you just follow and see for yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said this, Shen Moru started walking forward blankly just like Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was stunned to see the person that had suddenly appeared, but he didn\u2019t pause to ask questions and made to chase after Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>That person called out to him. \u201cBrother Baili, please wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk when I get back!\u201d Baili Yu glanced at him, uncertain of his intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu gongzi can handle following Lady Doudou. Brother Baili had better come with me to a certain place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after that person spoke, Mu Ye nodded towards Baili Yu and headed off.</p><br/><p>\u201cLan Jia, you\u2019d best explain yourself.\u201d Baili Yu turned around to face Lan Jia.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia chuckled, then pushed Shen Moru aside. His shallow eyes that seemed clear were currently unreadable. \u201cBrother Baili, could it be that you don\u2019t trust me anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrust must be built on reality. Reality has shown that the clue about Yiling that you gave me was wrong. Nangong Yan definitely isn\u2019t Yiling!\u201d The moment Baili Yu recalled this matter, rage filled his eyes. That damned woman!</p><br/><p>Lan Jia seemed surprised. \u201cShe isn\u2019t? However, the only female infant that was brought back to Cerulean Mountain was her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was still worried about Tang Doudou so he didn\u2019t want to waste time arguing about this. He turned to continue walking without replying.</p><br/><p>However, he only managed to take a few steps before he was hit with strong dizziness. His footing became unsteady and he crashed straight to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cLan Jia, you\u2026\u201d Before he even finished speaking, he fainted.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia walked to Baili Yu and crouched down. Reaching out, he stroked Baili Yu\u2019s face as he remarked, \u201cIt sure isn\u2019t easy to knock you out. It took almost eight people\u2019s portions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Mu Ye was chasing after Tang Doudou and heading towards the edge of the Sacred Tree. The further they went, the more serious his expression became, because there was not a single person around and no visible roads. The only thing ahead of them was an extremely deep abyss with billowing black smoke.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s gaze swept around. Where did she go?</p><br/><p>The sky was still covered with crows so it was very dim and hard to see things. Mu Ye tried every single direction, and even questioned multiple people, but no one had seen Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>He could only return to the edge of the Sacred Tree. As he gazed at the billowing black fog below him, his eyes flickered with hesitation. Could it be that she\u2019s jumped into the Devil\u2019s Depths?</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t dare to try confirming this guess, because there was no fate other than death for those who jump into the Devil\u2019s Depths. Although she wasn\u2019t conscious, she should still be very sensitive to danger due to her inner strength exploding. Devil\u2019s Depths was surrounded by the black fog year round and filled with the scent of death. There was no way that she wouldn\u2019t be able to notice this.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 If she hadn\u2019t jumped into Devil\u2019s Depths, where did she disappear to?</p><br/><p>Mu Ye looked at Devil\u2019s Depths for a long time. Just as he prepared to descend a little to look for signs of her, he saw a trace of red out of the corner of his eyes.</p><br/><p>He hastily went over and picked up that red item. It was the red string Tang Doudou had used to hang Baili Yu\u2019s thumb ring around her neck. It still contained the bound hair.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye abruptly looked towards Devil\u2019s Depths, then jumped in without any more hesitation.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Senior Jun had left something for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye, can you tell me who exactly you are?\u201d Tang Doudou felt like his actions had always been very strange. When exactly had it started?</p><br/><p>It had probably started that time in the Plum Garden banquet when he caught her in the bathroom and offered a collaboration. Ever since then, it felt like he had been completely different.</p><br/><p>Before that time, he had insisted on killing her.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s movements paused for a second. \u201cI\u2019m a guardian, the guardian of the Xuanyuan Tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was like that. She had guessed that it might\u2019ve been the case, but she hadn\u2019t been sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m a descendant of the Xuanyuan Tribe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your goal? Is it only to protect?\u201d Tang Doudou looked at him curiously. For some reason, she felt like it wouldn\u2019t be that simple.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou tried a different question. \u201cWhy did you try to kill me before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that it was you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you find out later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yi.\u201d Mu Ye glanced at her. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask about Baili Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve never lied. Since you said that he\u2019s fine, he\u2019s definitely still alive, so I\u2019m not in a hurry. I\u2019ll find him sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Ye smiled softly as well. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thanking me for? I haven\u2019t even had a chance to thank you properly. You\u2019ve saved me so many times that I can\u2019t even repay you enough in this lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>If there a next life existed, hopefully she would meet him earlier and fall in love with him in order to make up for everything he had done for her in this life.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye pressed his lips together. \u201cI saw someone rescue and take him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d As expected, Mu Ye didn\u2019t lie to her. She really was grateful that he had delivered those strands of hair to her. Otherwise, she\u2019d still be bickering with Jun Xin craftily and looking for an opportunity to commit suicide.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye didn\u2019t reply and instead asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t blame me for not stopping it from happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye ah, Mu Ye. Though you\u2019re the guardian of the Xuanyuan Tribe, that doesn\u2019t make you my personal guardian, right? No matter what you do or how you do it, I wouldn\u2019t blame you, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s face remained cold and expressionless so Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t tell if he really understood. He just gave a soft \u2018en\u2019 before saying, \u201cNangong Yan. She was the one that took Baili Yu away.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou heard this, she immediately exploded. \u201cWhy the heck didn\u2019t yah stop them!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye looked at her with slight mirth in his eyes as if he was laughing at her for forgetting what she had just said.</p><br/><p>No matter how thick Tang Doudou\u2019s skin was, she\u2019d still feel embarrassed for going back on her word so soon. She furrowed her brows and said, \u201cAhem, I mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Zhiyuan was following them.\u201d Mu Ye walked into the house. \u201cI suffered an internal injury when fighting with Shen Moru. If it had only been Nan Yansheng, I would\u2019ve stopped her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou understood the picture and relaxed. Since Nangong Yan loved Baili Yu, she wouldn\u2019t do anything to him.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, that crazy Liu Zhiyuan might try to do something to Baili Yu. However, with Nangong Yan there, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to do much, so at the very least, Baili Yu\u2019s life was safe for now.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye led her into the house, then had her sit down while he went upstairs. He soon returned with a large chest in his arms.</p><br/><p>That was a huge chest. Jun Yuner had left behind so much stuff?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin and moved next to Mu Ye. He placed the chest on the table and opened it with a strange method. A strange stench immediately burst out. Tang Doudou hastily covered her nose. \u201cWhat is that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all, as if he didn\u2019t smell anything.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t answer Tang Doudou\u2019s question and just reached into the chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? What\u2019s inside? It stinks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye glanced over with a helpless expression. Tang Doudou smiled politely as she kept her distance from him.</p><br/><p>As Mu Ye pulled it out, Tang Doudou peeked over and found that it was actually a potted flower\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said with a laugh, \u201cDid my mother leave me a flower to tell me not to forget my female identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye replied seriously, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what does it mean? Speaking of which, this flower really stinks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye didn\u2019t answer and placed the pot on the table. Tang Doudou got a little closer, then her eyes lit up. This flower was actually really unique. It was black and red and looked like it had little hands. There was even a layer of small short fur on it that made it look pretty cute.</p><br/><p>But, then stink seemed to be coming from it. It was was like the smell of rotting flesh.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye calmly pulled out another object from the chest.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced over, then hastily backed away. \u201cWh-why are you bringing out a snake!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch carefully.\u201d Mu Ye pinched the snake\u2019s head firmly as he glanced over at Tang Doudou. \u201cThe Swayflower likes eating snakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, he threw the snake at the flower. The snake struggled to escape but several sharp furs abruptly extended from the hand-like part of the plant and stabbed into the snake. The snake struggled hard to get free, but it was already too late.</p><br/><p>Its body started rapidly shriveling up.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was probably nothing else left to smash. All that was left was the distinct sound of heavy panting.</p><br/><p>After Liu Zhiyuan spoke those earlier words, he didn\u2019t make anymore sounds.</p><br/><p>Nangong Yan started crying. \u201cWhy? Why are you treating me this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? I also want to ask you why you treat me this way?\u201d Liu Zhiyuan didn\u2019t soften when Nangong Yan cried; his tone remained cold and vicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do? You\u2019re the servant Father bought, a lowly and wretched existence. Putting it nicely, one would call you a servant, but one can also say you\u2019re just a dog! Could it be that I\u2019d have to be polite to a dog?\u201d Even at this point, Nangong Yan still refused to humble down her attitude.</p><br/><p>These words successfully drove Liu Zhiyuan to explode. \u201cDog of a slave!? You\u2019re right! I\u2019m just a dog!\u201d</p><br/><p>His words contained so much anger it sounded almost tangible.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shuddered as she silently remarked, oh no.</p><br/><p>As she expected, there was the sound of a thump as something heavy hit the ground. Following that was a low pained moan.</p><br/><p>F*ck! The person has started \u2018driving\u2019 again by himself without a word.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was very conflicted. Although Liu Zhiyuan hadn\u2019t stated it clearly, nor had Nangong Yan admitted to it, the whole story was already very clear. Back then, Baili Yu hadn\u2019t drunk that soup and the only person that could have possibly delivered the soup was Nangong Yan\u2019s most trusted aid, Liu Zhiyuan.</p><br/><p>Since Baili Yu hadn\u2019t drunk that soup, it was very likely that Liu Zhiyuan drank it. It was even more likely that Nangong Yan had ended up drinking it.</p><br/><p>Regardless of who it was that drank the soup, something had definitely happened between Liu Zhiyuan and Nangong Yan.</p><br/><p>Later, Nangong Yan figured out what had happened, but she continued to deceive herself and refused to accept the fact that something had happened between her and Liu Zhiyuan. Following that, she continued being infatuated with Baili Yu while gradually hating Liu Zhiyuan more and more.</p><br/><p>The reason she was so nasty to the person always accompanying her was probably because she felt humiliated from the thought that Liu Zhiyuan had sullied her.</p><br/><p>She wanted to kill him, but couldn\u2019t find a good reason. Her greatest fear was probably that Liu Zhiyuan would reveal the incident.</p><br/><p>At the same time, she started to feel that she was unworthy of Baili Yu. However, her desire to obtain Baili Yu only increased. After constantly suppressing these painful feelings for such a long time, it caused her mentality to twist. That was why she wanted to also sully the people by Baili Yu\u2019s side and cause them to feel the same pain.</p><br/><p>After organizing this information and sorting out her thoughts\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt that she was completely innocent! Why did she end up getting hit by this even though she was lying so far away?</p><br/><p>However, if Baili Yu disliked Nangong Yan so much, why did he walked out of this room with her so intimately that day?</p><br/><p>Could it be that his personality had suddenly changed?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t very likely.</p><br/><p>As she was thinking through the possibilities, Mu Ye\u2019s voice suddenly appeared in the room. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou came back to her senses. There were still faint sounds of that poignant drama coming through the wall so she gulped. \u201cUh, nothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, how bad did she expect Mu Ye\u2019s hearing ability to be?</p><br/><p>Mu Ye had already noticed the vulgar sounds coming from next door when he entered. It was just that he hadn\u2019t expected Tang Doudou to be so bored as to stand here and listen to them\u2026</p><br/><p>His expression became a little unnatural. The rumors on the Jianghu really were true. Her conduct was sometimes, indeed a little\u2026 not enough like a virtuous lady.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye said, \u201cIf it\u2019s nothing, then let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou replied \u2018oh,\u2019 then hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, why don\u2019t we save her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNangong Yan!\u201d Tang Doudou really couldn\u2019t bear to just ignore this. Although it wasn\u2019t the first time between Nangong Yan and Liu Zhiyuan, Nangong Yan was an unwilling party.</p><br/><p>Although she was hateful, the most loathsome person was Liu Zhiyuan. He was the most deranged person.</p><br/><p>A couple years ago, Nangong Yan was probably only around fifteen. That was the age where young girls longed most for a wonderful love. Right at that time, she ended up encountering someone as perfect as Baili Yu, so it was no surprise that she fell in love. When she failed to obtain him and decided to use desperate measures, not only did Liu Zhiyuan not stop her, he even took advantage of this chance to sully her body and her mentality. After taking the wrong step once, she ended up continuing to land on the wrong steps.</p><br/><p>She fell in love with the wrong person and took the wrong path, so she was destined to have a pitiful life.</p><br/><p>Her current personality and situation stemmed from Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s doings.</p><br/><p>His love truly was as Nangong Yan described, not only was it wretched, lowly, and shameless, it was even perverted!</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s gaze focused on her eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I tell you after you save her?\u201d Tang Doudou curved her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll definitely find it interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye slanted a look at her. \u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know you\u2019re not interested before even hearing about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye started walking.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily chased after him. \u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stopped and tilted his head. \u201cTo rescue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou cheered then followed him to jump over the wall. In an instant, they landed in front of the house next door.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye walked up without a pause and kicked down the wooden door.</p><br/><p>There was a burst of dust and splinters, but since Tang Doudou was hiding behind Mu Ye, none of it got on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho!?\u201d There was the sound of Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s voice, followed by the rustle of clothing.</p><br/><p>When the dust settled and Mu Ye and Tang Doudou\u2019s figures were revealed, Liu Zhiyuan first looked stunned before his expression turned dark. He then pulled Nangong Yan into his arms and pressed a sword against her neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t approach or I\u2019ll kill her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re using Nangong Yan to threaten me? Liu Zhiyuan, did you get out of bed head-first this morning? Damaged your brain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>She continued, \u201cAiy, actually, I\u2019m just here to enjoy the show. You guys don\u2019t need to mind me! Go ahead and continue!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

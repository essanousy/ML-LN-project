Although the figure in black behind her, Ye Chuan, was chasing after her and shouting nonstop, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t even turn back once.</p><br/><p>Humph! Who asked you to make me bait!? Wait until Baili Yu\u2019s wound starts to rot, see if there\u2019ll be anyone there to change the medicine for him!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that she was heartless. They were the ones that forced her!</p><br/><p>Recalling this, Tang Doudou lifted the whip in her hand again and lashed it down fiercely. The white horse instantly shot forward like a released arrow.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou only slightly lowered her eyes to look back after rushing forward for quite a while. She saw that Ye Chuan had fallen far behind and felt indescribably refreshed.</p><br/><p>However, before this refreshed feeling had managed to even fully spread, the sound of Ye Chuan\u2019s shout reached her. \u201cLi Xueyi! Hurry up and dodge! Dodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>Hearing Ye Chuan\u2019s angry yet worried shout, Tang Doudou hastily turned back to look towards the front.</p><br/><p>She was immediately shocked by the sight of the numerous knives flying towards her and froze</p><br/><p>in fear.</p><br/><p>Behind her, Ye Chuan had already leapt into the air to rush towards her. As he flew, he continued shouting, \u201cDodge! Li Xueyi, are you stupid? Hurry and dodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was scared out of her wits. Although she heard what Ye Chuan said, her body wouldn\u2019t listen to her. She continued to grip the reins desperately. The thought of pulling the horse to a stop didn\u2019t even occur to her, so the horse continued to carry her rapidly towards the incoming blades. Ye Chuan was so far away that he couldn\u2019t possibly make it in time. All he could do was watch helplessly as those blades approached Tang Doudou like a moving ray of light.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan subconsciously squeezed his eyes shut. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to watch the ensuing bloody scene.</p><br/><p>He had just closed his eyes when he heard the \u2018pipapipa\u2019 sound of blades crossing. Ye Chuan hastily opened his eyes again and found that Tang Doudou was currently shielded by a tall figure. The figure moved sharply and the long chain in the person\u2019s hand danced in the air like a dragon snake, striking away and blocking the continuous stream of flying knives.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s Mu Ye! Why was he here?</p><br/><p>This was the first question that emerged in Ye Chuan\u2019s head. Soon after, he reached Tang Doudou\u2019s side. </p><br/><p>He only discovered after getting closer that Tang Doudou was lying flat on the horse\u2019s back and was so scared that she was trembling. The tears on her face resembled raindrops on a pear blossom. Seeing this, the first thing that came out of his mouth was a worried, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>If she had really ended up meeting with a mishap, it would have been due to him. When this thought appeared in his head, Ye Chuan started feeling guilty.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wiped her streaming tears and yelled at him while sobbing, \u201cWho wants your false concern! If I had died, wouldn\u2019t it have been just what you wanted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t run that fast, they wouldn\u2019t have found an opportunity to attack!\u201d Although he felt guilty, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from blurting out to refute Tang Doudou\u2019s words. After those words came out, he scratched his head while slightly embarrassed. \u201cI, that\u2019s not what I meant. I just wanted you to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Tang Doudou gave a humph then turned away, refusing to talk to him anymore.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan still wanted to try and explain but Mu Ye suddenly descended and stood silently next to the horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Mu Ye!\u201d Tang Doudou thanked him sincerely. Her watery eyes were still filled with lingering fear. Had he not saved her, she\u2019d be an ice-cold corpse by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks Sect Master Mu for granting aid! Ye Chuan cannot thank you enough!\u201d said Ye Chuan with cupped fists. His tone was neither servile nor overbearing, but it was clearly very sincere.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye just glanced over the two of them coldly. His line of sight paused on Tang Doudou\u2019s face for a few seconds before shifting away. He then spat out four stiff words, \u201cWas just passing by.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes multiple times upon hearing this. Could such a coincidence possibly happen?</p><br/><p>Putting aside the fact for now that the incident had occurred so abruptly, the surroundings were as quiet as an airport! How was it possible for Mu Ye to coincidentally pass by just as she encountered danger?</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t even anywhere to hide in these surroundings.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t suspect Mu Ye of arranging people to kill her. Send people to kill her and then rescue her? Even if Mu Ye had a mental illness, he wouldn\u2019t do something this stupid, right?T/N2</p><br/><p>Hero saving the beauty?</p><br/><p>That was even less likely. Who didn\u2019t know of the accumulated rancor between them?</p><br/><p>Not to mention, for Mu Ye with that ice-cold personality of his to know about \u2018hero saving the beauty\u2019? It\u2019d be more likely for a mother pig to climb up a tree! On the other hand, someone like Baili Yu would probably be idle enough to do something that stupid.</p><br/><p>Pei pei! Why was she thinking of that bastard again?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou recollected her thoughts. It was likely that Mu Ye had been following behind them this entire time. She had been solely focused on shaking off Ye Chuan and Ye Chuan had been focusing on catching up to her, that\u2019s probably why they didn\u2019t notice that Mu Ye was following them.</p><br/><p>It was fortunate, however, that he had been following them. Otherwise, she probably would have lost her little life today!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what, we owe Sect Master great thanks.\u201d Ye Chuan\u2019s personality was simply that obstinate and his thoughts often could not bend around curves. He couldn\u2019t be called dumb; he dealt with matters neatly and tidily and was incomparably astute. However, to say he wasn\u2019t dumb? Sometimes he was so insensitive that he could irritate someone to death.</p><br/><p>Of course, these were all things that Meng Yu had said to her. In reality, she hadn\u2019t interacted much with Ye Chuan so how could she possibly know that much?</p><br/><p>This time, Mu Ye didn\u2019t even bother to spare a cold glance over. With a flick, the iron chain retracted back into his sleeves and he turned around to walk back. He walked towards the group of subordinates Ye Chuan had brought and leapt onto the empty horse among them. He didn\u2019t even lift his whip. The horse followed a silent command and rushed past Tang Doudou and Ye Chuan.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019ve been rushing around the entire time dealing with things, when did I have the free time to go anywhere fun to play?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomewhere fun to play?\u201d Cang Baicao suddenly pushed open the door and walked in, carrying a bowl of black medicinal soup. \u201cYou two are planning to go somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Cang, why do you never knock before entering a room!?\u201d Tang Doudou hastily rolled off Baili Yu and ducked into the blankets, her face flushed. This old man was seriously way too disrespectful as a senior, to walk in without even knocking. What if she and Baili Yu were\u2026 Pei pei! She hastily shook those thoughts out of her head. \u201cWhat medicine is that? It stinks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, you shouldn\u2019t show disdain for it just because it smells. It\u2019s a miracle medicine that I invested a lot of effort into gathering the ingredients for. I guarantee that once you drink it, you\u2019ll be able to jump around again by the next day!\u201d Cang Baicao handed the bowl to Baili Yu. \u201cBaili gongzi, I\u2019ll have to trouble you with making sure that this girl drinks it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Cang is being too polite.\u201d As Baili Yu took the bowl, Cang Baicao sent him a look. Baili Yu immediately understood, then he said softly, \u201cDoudou, come on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou originally wanted to refuse, but she was tempted by what Cang Baicao said about being able to recover by the next day, so she pinched her nose and chugged the medicine.</p><br/><p>A relieved expression appeared on Cang Baicao\u2019s face when he saw that she had drunk the medicine obediently. Then he took the empty bowl and left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I feel sleepy again after just waking up?\u201d Right after Cang Baicao left, Tang Doudou was hit with a wave of sleepiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal to feel sleepy when you\u2019re not well. Sleep for a little while longer, I\u2019m going to go ask Senior Cang about curing the poison in your body.\u201d Baili Yu got up and tucked Tang Doudou back in before heading out.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Tang Doudou had a feeling that he was keeping something secret from her, but she couldn\u2019t figure out what it could be.</p><br/><p>Her eyelids were barely fending off the pull of gravity, but she didn\u2019t want to sleep so she got up, pulled on some clothes, then quietly left the room. The sunlight outside was mild and it was very comfortable on the skin.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu and Cang Baicao were in the middle of discussing something when they heard the door open. They turned around and saw that Tang Doudou was standing under the hazy sunlight and seemed very woozy. Baili Yu\u2019s face filled with worry and he was about to rush over when Cang Baicao stopped him.</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao pulled Baili Yu over to a room to hide. \u201cMu Ye will definitely look for her. Let\u2019s see what he\u2019ll say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Cang, I want to take a trip out of the valley.\u201d Baili Yu abruptly said this after a moment of hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d Cang Baicao was surprised. Hadn\u2019t he said that he wouldn\u2019t leave Tang Doudou behind? Why did he suddenly decide to leave again?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about things. I feel like it would be better to send someone to look for Lan Jia rather than to just sit here without any results. I\u2019m sure that Lan Jia definitely has a way!\u201d This wasn\u2019t a sudden idea, he had been thinking about this the entire night. Even if Lan Jia didn\u2019t know of a way, the Saint Tribes definitely had related records. If it came to it, he\u2019d just make another trip to Cerulean Mountain.</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao considered things. \u201cAlthough my medicinal expertise is pretty good, my martial arts aren\u2019t good at all. Can you really rest easy leaving Doudou by herself here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back before dark.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you heading back to Huai City?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to. However, don\u2019t let Mu Ye find out that I\u2019m not here. I\u2019m worried that he\u2019ll try to take Doudou away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know that Baili Yu had left. After she adjusted to the sunlight and got chilled by the autumn wind, she felt much more alert and wasn\u2019t as dazed as before. She walked around the courtyard to look around. It turned out that Cang Baicao\u2019s place was actually pretty nice.</p><br/><p>Li Xueyi definitely came to this place often, but this was her first time here so she was curious about everything.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of blooming herbs in the courtyard with refreshing fragrances. The jade bamboo leaves around made soft rustling noises that were very soothing in combination with the distant birdsongs. Suddenly, Tang Doudou noticed that something pure black was on the roof.</p><br/><p>Her eyes lit up and she jumped onto the roof. \u201cMu Ye, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she seemed to recall something and asked, \u201cHave you been following me this entire time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye glanced over coldly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou noticed that his tone was a little off, so she rubbed her chin as she asked, \u201cDid something happen? Are you really going to just leave the Demonic Sect like that and stop managing it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye, are you alright?\u201d When she saw that his expression was becoming even more off, she reached out and patted his shoulder with a heartful sigh. \u201cYou don\u2019t really have any friends, so I\u2019m one of the few you can really talk to. In addition, you\u2019ve saved me several times before. You can talk to me about anything, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll laugh at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye turned to look seriously at her. \u201cI want to take you away.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

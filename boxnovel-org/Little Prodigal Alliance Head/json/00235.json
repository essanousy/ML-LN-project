Since Tang Doudou was resting here, he could only rest in the carriage. However, it wasn\u2019t the time to rest yet. He took advantage of this time while Tang Doudou slept to call Feng Long and Jun Xin to the path outside the village.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Long, how is the investigation going?\u201d He had been focusing on suppressing the Hoarfrost Poison for the past few days so he hadn\u2019t had the chance to ask Feng Long about this.</p><br/><p>Feng Long was still pretty docile in front of Baili Yu. However, she would still seize Jun Xin up from time to time. \u201cReplying Master, this subordinate has found the place where Madam Qin was last seen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Baili Yu seemed excited to hear the words Madam Qin and hastily asked about it.</p><br/><p>Feng Long glanced at Jun Xin. \u201cIt was the Jia family village outside of Wind Cloud Island. The people that knew of the event said that Madam Qin had arrived in the Jin family village with two children. After staying there for a night, she disappeared. No one saw how she left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, a boy and an infant girl. The boy was about three years old and the age of the girl was unknown,\u201d replied Feng Long.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was silent for a long while, then he glanced at Jun Xin. \u201cAre you sure that it was a female infant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! After that villager said that, I looked through the room Madam Qin once lived in several times and found this under the bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she pulled out something wrapped with cloth and handed it to Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu opened it in front of the two. There was half a broken jade piece inside. He picked it up to examine it, then noticed that there was a tiny \u2018ling\u2019 character on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yunling.\u201d Feng Long checked Baili Yu\u2019s expression. Upon seeing that it seemed normal, she continued, \u201cShe\u2019s Master\u2019s biological younger sister, and the female infant Madam Qin had been carrying back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate has already investigated it thoroughly and brought back all the evidence and witnesses. They are located in the nearby stone garrison. Once we reach that place, Master can question them again and examine the evidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, good work.\u201d Baili Yu put away the jade. Then he glanced at Feng Long before turning to Jun Xin. \u201cAh Xin, you still haven\u2019t been able to get in touch with Yun Hai?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already mobilized everyone in God Firmament Hall but there has been no news about him at all. I\u2019m afraid something has already happened to him.\u201d When this matter was brought up, Jun Xin\u2019s expression turned gloomy. It was very likely that the plan had failed and Yun Hai had already encountered an unexpected development.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if something had happened, there should still be some news,\u201d said Feng Long.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin slanted a glance at her. \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s the Seven Great Saint Tribes or Wind Cloud Island, neither of them are easy to deal with. The more you learn about them, the more you\u2019ll realize that they have too many secrets and what we know is nothing but the tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seven Great Saint Tribes are very mysterious, but Yun Hai\u2019s task this time doesn\u2019t provoke them in any way, so why are you linking them together?\u201d Feng Long lifted her brows as she refuted with a cold laugh.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin gave a disdainful humph. \u201cHow ignorant! Yun Hai\u2019s task doesn\u2019t have anything to do with them this time, but the Seven Great Saint Tribes are also investigating this matter so encounters and conflicts will be hard to avoid. Those people are all lunatics and won\u2019t sit down to talk reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that we have to go find the Seven Great Saint Tribes to demand the person back?\u201d said Feng Long pointedly.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin could hear the meaning contained within her words and shot her a cold look. \u201cI\u2019ve already said that Yun Hai isn\u2019t in the Seven Great Saint Tribes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Long sneered, \u201cThen isn\u2019t everything you just said fart?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Long! Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t dare to hit you just because you\u2019re a woman!\u201d bellowed Jun Xin. This crazy woman had started needling him again the moment she came back. He seriously couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>Feng Long didn\u2019t seem concerned about his threat at all. Rolling up her sleeves, she pushed Jun Xin and said provocatively, \u201cCome on, you think I\u2019m still afraid of you? I\u2019ve been wanting to thrash you for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon seeing that the two were about to fight, Baili Yu swept a mild gaze over the two and said, \u201cIf you want to fight, then hurry up. Don\u2019t waste our discussion time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he smiled and started playing with the jade ring on his thumb. \u201cKnow that I won\u2019t be giving compensation if you die though. However, it\u2019s also good timing. This place has beautiful scenery. At that time, it\u2019d be pretty convenient to get someone to dig a hole and bury you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Long and Jun Xin simultaneously rolled their eyes. How could there exist such a heartless master who looked forward to his subordinates fighting so much?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

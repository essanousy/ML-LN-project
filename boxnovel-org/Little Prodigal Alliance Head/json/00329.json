Asking too much isn\u2019t good for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian er immediately stopped crying. After a brief moment, he started crying with even more energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I knew you were smart.\u201d Tang Doudou nodded in satisfaction, then pinched Lian er\u2018s face before getting up. \u201cI\u2019m heading out to handle a few matters, I\u2019ll be back soon. No matter what, don\u2019t stop before I get back, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian er hastily nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, good boy. After this is over, I\u2019ll help buy your freedom and arrange a place for you to live the rest of your life.\u201d After Tang Doudou said that, she took off her pink outer garment, then took off Lian er\u2018s clothes and threw them towards the foot of the bed.</p><br/><p>Following that, she jumped out of the window and headed towards the room she had stayed in before. When she saw that there was no one around, she quietly pushed open the window and walked in.</p><br/><p>Although a lot of events had occurred, barely any time had elapsed since Tang Doudou entered the inn and left the room. Jin Yi had waited outside Yuelai Inn for a while before giving his subordinates the instructions to wait around discreet areas of the inn.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, he quietly landed on the roof and leaned down to listen. After a short while, his face flushed and his expression turned strange. Li Xueyi had actually brought Lian er out to do\u2026 that!?</p><br/><p>It was preposterous!</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t that strange. Li Xueyi has always been infamous. Even if she had returned to her female identity, it was still hard for her to change her vulgar habits. Baili Yu was the one that should be pitied. He had money, influence, and incomparable looks, yet he fell in love with this kind of woman despite all the women available to choose from.</p><br/><p>Jin Yi ordered his subordinates to continue watching the inn, then headed back to Wind Cherishing House.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder she insisted on bringing Lian er out of all those courtesans!\u201d After hearing Jin Yi\u2019s report, Gu Xun\u2019s facial color turned dark. If she had wanted to do something with Lian er, she could\u2019ve just brought him back to Huai City with her. How could she have the mood to play even in such an important moment\u2026</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t right. Gu Xun furrowed his brows and asked, \u201cTell me everything she did after she headed out. Don\u2019t leave even a single detail out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything special. She just strolled around the streets with Lian er several times, then headed to the garrison entrance before turning back to head to Yuelai Inn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStroll? Which street was it on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe street on the east side of Yuelai Inn,\u201d replied Jin Yi.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun\u2019s expression immediately changed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that where Lin Shuxuan is staying? She went to look for Lin Shuxuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yi was confused. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible, right? She hasn\u2019t left Yuelai Inn since going in, and this subordinate personally went to eavesdrop on them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something fishy, so be vigilant. Head back and just keep a watch on her for now. Once the time comes, remind her to hurry back. This cannot be delayed, otherwise we\u2019ll all be in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, why go through so much trouble?\u201d Jin Yi couldn\u2019t understand why Gu Xun was going to such lengths. Baili Yu and Tang Doudou were currently in their hands, so his master could easily decide those two\u2019s fates.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun smiled coldly. \u201cWhat would you know?</p><br/><p>\u201ci want to openly become the martial arts alliance head. I\u2019m not aiming to get it with threats and tricks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate understands. This subordinate will go right away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou took that box down from its concealed location above the beam of the roof. After making sure that everything inside was still in order, she jumped back to the ground.</p><br/><p>There was a person in the room that had been watching her this whole time.</p><br/><p>Once she came down, that person asked quietly, \u201cAlliance Head Li, why were you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou put away the box, then smiled widely. \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019ve been aware of my identity this whole time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li is overestimating me.\u201d Lin Shuxuan laughed politely. \u201cAll that I guessed was that Alliance Head Li was female. I had no idea that you were actually the alliance head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled. \u201cIt was that time when we were drinking on the boat, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, to tell the truth, I\u2019m still suspicious of you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuspicious of me?\u201d Lin Shuxuan burst out laughing. \u201cWhat does Alliance Head Li need to be suspicious of me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t explain and just continued, \u201cBrother Lin, I indeed have something to request of you. Will you be able to help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Shuxuan could tell that it was an urgent matter since she was being so straightforward about it. After considering it a moment, he nodded. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s something I can help with, I\u2019ll definitely help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Brother Lin, this is something you\u2019ll definitely be able to help with!\u201d Tang Doudou pulled him over. \u201cIt\u2019s like this, my situation is a bit troublesome right now. I\u2019m being held captive in Wind Cherishing House.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Shuxuan was surprised. \u201cBut you\u2019re the martial arts alliance head. That Wind Cherishing House\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of the owner of Wind Cherishing House. We have a bit of history, and now I\u2019ve fallen into his hands. That\u2019s why I spent so much time strolling on the streets. I had no choice but to use the methods you told me about a few days ago to contact you instead of looking for you directly. Right now, this inn is also surrounded by his men.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to help you escape from Wind Cherishing House?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! To leave Hibiscus Garrison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d An unreadable expression flashed through the depths of Lin Shuxuan\u2019s eyes. \u201cAlright. Then Alliance Head Li, please tell me how I can help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled mysteriously, then leaned closer to his ear and whispered into it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

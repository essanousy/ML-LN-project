Rather, it was her, the main subject that sat at the side enjoying the show while cracking melons seeds between her teeth.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cMother Mo Yun*, whether this saying is true or not, you and I both know in our hearts. Why must you deceive others and yourself?\u201d Xiao Yiyun looked towards Mo Yun, his expression particularly disdainful.</p><br/><p>The ways to refer to a nun is either Sister or Mother in English. I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s an older women because it\u2019s </p><br/><p>The hand Mo Yun pointed at him trembled and shook. With a bang she slammed it on the table next to her and the wooden table immediately cracked and splintered, accompanying her voice that was practically spitting anger: \u201cEven though the City Lord has to give a separate explanation on this matter with Li Xueyi, but you guys shouldn\u2019t forget about all that heart\u2019s blood the City Lord put out for the community of martial artists!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Smack smack. Looks like this Mo Yun is a supporter of the City Lord of Cloud City.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The person\u2019s not bad ah, she separates the crooked and the straight pretty well.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou grabbed some of the snacks placed next to her and dashingly threw it into her mouth. After smashing and chewing for a few bites, she suddenly felt something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This flavor is way too strange!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Pei pei pei! She quickly spat it out and picked up the cup next to her, taking a large gulp. Out of the corner of her eyes, she show Bai Feiyun stare at her with a face of misgivings.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit unpalatable.\u201d Tang Doudou pointed to the plate next to her and said.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun glanced at the dried fruit in that plate and said a bit unhappily: \u201cThis snack is the specialty of Rutaceae Pavilion. It\u2019s something that you usually wouldn\u2019t be able to eat even if you wanted to, when it comes to your mouth how did it end up becoming unpalatable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like this can be counted as a specialty?\u201d As a local delicacies foodie, Tang Doudou expressed that she begged to differ. Her tone of disdain reached the extreme and she completely didn\u2019t notice Bai Feiyun\u2019s expression turning more and more ugly.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Alliance Head feels it\u2019s unfit to enter your golden mouth, then just don\u2019t eat it.\u201d Bai Feiyun stretched out his hand and swept the small plate onto the ground. With a \u2018palala\u2019 it shattered into pieces.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>His voice was not loud but it was also not soft. It happened to be just after Mo Yun got angry and a brief period of silence had appeared in the hall so everyone heard this clear as crystal.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Alliance Head\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Elder Yu\u2019s sharp gaze froze for a moment before immediately sweeping over.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s hand trembled for a moment and the expression of calm on her face almost collapsed, but luckily, she had always been thick-skinned. Immediately she returned his gaze without the slightest hint of fear, looking back at Elder Yu with an arrogant provoking expression. A complete scene of Li Xueyi is precisely this daddy, this daddy is precisely Li Xueyi. This daddy is the Alliance Head, what can an old thing like you do to me?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Just as expected, the beard that covered Elder Yu\u2019s entire face jumped a few jumps. Li Xueyi had actually been in the hall for so long and he had no idea. No wonder Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t react at all to Xiao Yiyun\u2019s provocations, no wonder, no wonder\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Calming down his frame of mind, Elder Yu pulled his face into a smile: \u201cDidn\u2019t think that Alliance Head had already arrived long ago, I thought\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThought what? Thought this Alliance Head was disposed of just by those couple scamps from the Demonic Sect?\u201d Since she had been pushed out, she definitely could not show weakness. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way this crowd of people would just let her off?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Just from what these people said earlier she already knew that she must wade through this muddy water*!</p><br/><p>A saying that\u2019s like, she can\u2019t get out and clean herself even if she wants to, so she\u2019ll just have to be resolute and work through the situation.</p><br/><p>Who asked her to be wearing Li Xueyi\u2019s corporeal body?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>From the moment she was pushed out by Bai Feiyun, Li Xueyi was her, she was precisely Li Xueyi!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She must sort out this mess, otherwise even if she was lucky enough to walk out of this Rutaceae Pavilion today, the outside, as large of a sky and earth as it has, is completely inside this Jianghu pot. A small fry like her will be eaten sooner or later, without even a bone left!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It was just that Bai Feiyun still didn\u2019t make a single sound. He didn\u2019t even give her a slightest bit of warning before pushing her out which made Tang Doudou a little bit disappointed. She originally thought that she could become good friends with him. After all, Bai Feiyun was the first person to help her ever since she arrived here.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Gathering up her thoughts, Tang Doudou stood up and walked step by step towards the center stage of the hall.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In the flames of the flickering candles, the young man\u2019s white garment was like snow. Arrogantly aglow with health and vigor, his hair lightly floated along his figure, a simple headband tied the hair up. The candlelight penetrated through the gauze clothes and casted a glazed light, which contrasted with the youngster\u2019s face to give off an enchanting radiance. His petal lips slightly rose up, light illuminated his eyelashes, dyeing them in a slight sunrise-like glow. Nodding, the smiling expression in his eyes gradually became stronger, from the start until now, his gaze containing a provocation never left Elder Yu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Is there a need for me to help you find him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the annoying part. I think of him as a senior brother and show him my utmost respect but he never treats me as a junior brother. He never takes care of me. Not only is he always distant, now he doesn\u2019t even look at me!\u201d Nangong Yan started feeling wronged again.</p><br/><p>That black-robed man said, \u201cThen why are you looking for him? You should just head back to Wind Cloud Island. Cerulean Mountain is about to start the Saint Offering Conference. When the time comes, everyone that isn\u2019t needed will be disposed of. My position in the Saint Tribes isn\u2019t as strong as in the past. It\u2019ll probably be difficult for me to protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Nangong Yan lowered her head as a trace of bashfulness flashed across her face. \u201cI just wanted to ask Senior Brother whether he was really the one that did that back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d The black-robed man glanced at Nangong Yan with shock. \u201cYou\u2019ve fallen in love with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Yan didn\u2019t explain what happened back then. When she heard the question \u2018you\u2019ve fallen in love with him,\u2019 her heart pounded so hard she felt like it was about to jump out of her chest. Even the tips of her ears flushed red.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, the black-robed person\u2019s eyes gradually turned cold. In the end, he slapped the table and shouted, \u201cYan er, you had best give up on this! You can\u2019t like Baili Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!?\u201d Nangong Yan glowered. She couldn\u2019t understand why everyone said this. What part of her was bad? Could it be that she was that far from being a suitable match for Senior Brother?</p><br/><p>The black-robed person sighed heavily. \u201cYan er, in the past, you always asked me about your identity, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of confusion flashed through Nangong Yan\u2019s eyes. Why did he suddenly bring this up? She did ask about this a lot in the past, but she had stopped asking after she became the adopted daughter of the Nangong family.</p><br/><p>The black-robed man said, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that the time hadn\u2019t arrived yet, I would have told you earlier. However, you\u2019re actually having this kind of thought now, it\u2019s seriously\u2026 it\u2019s seriously letting down that person!\u201d</p><br/><p>The more Nangong Yan heard, the more confused she became. \u201cHow does this have anything to do with me liking Senior Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-clothed person gave another heavy sigh and shook his head as he looked at her. In the end, he didn\u2019t tell her the reason and just tried to dissuade her. \u201cIn a bit, I\u2019ll get someone to help you leave Cerulean Mountain. As for Baili Yu, you should just give up on this thought! He\u2019s already engaged! Why put yourself through this futile struggle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t! Why do I have to give up!? I\u2019m clearly the one Senior Brother likes! If it weren\u2019t for Li Xueyi using her schemes, I would\u2019ve already gotten married to Senior Brother! I\u2026 I can\u2019t accept this!\u201d Nangong Yan hadn\u2019t expected that even the uncle who had always doted on her wouldn\u2019t support her in this. She had already heard words like this countless times. When she first heard these words, she did feel that there was some logic to them, but the more she heard these same words, the more annoyed she became. She wasn\u2019t causing a fuss out of nothing. Back then, Senior Brother had liked her. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have\u2026</p><br/><p>The more Nangong Yan thought about it, the more wrong she felt. Why did it felt like she was the mistress? Why did everyone criticize her? It was clearly Li Xueyi who came in, destroyed their relationship, and snatched Senior Brother away.</p><br/><p>It was all because of that hateful woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cYan er, you won\u2019t even listen to the words I say anymore?\u201d The black-robed man became a little angry and slapped the table with both hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve already fallen in love with Senior Brother, and even swore that I won\u2019t marry anyone but him\u2026\u201d Nangong Yan lowered her head, feeling extremely hurt. She covered her face and started sobbing.</p><br/><p>The black-clothed man shook his head. His eyes were filled with remorse as he said, \u201cI really should have told you the truth earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat truth? Uncle, tell me already!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d A conflicted expression appeared on the black-robed man\u2019s face. However, before he could speak, he saw that a black-robed person had appeared in front of the window. He immediately stood up and demanded, \u201cWho are you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reality is nothing more than thus. Why is Sire so unwilling to tell?\u201d said Baili Yu. His low charming voice contained the usual hint of an amused tone.</p><br/><p>Nangong Yan immediately lifted her tearstained face to look towards the figure outside the window. Even with the black robe, his handsomeness couldn\u2019t be concealed. She rubbed her eyes. When she found that it wasn\u2019t a hallucination, she called out hesitantly, \u201cSenior Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Tang Doudou had followed the white-robed Saint Envoy east until they arrived at a row of small cabins. The black-robed youngster casually picked a room and pushed it open. \u201cHere! Hurry up, don\u2019t waste time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou slowly walked in. There was probably some sort of rule regarding this, as the white-robed Saint Envoy and that youngster didn\u2019t follow her in and just closed the door.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was looking around the small room to see if there was any way to escape when she heard quiet sobbing come from next door. It seemed to be a woman crying. Her curiosity was immediately tickled and she slowly approached that wall.</p><br/><p>She pressed her ear against the wall and the sobbing gradually became clearer. \u201cWuuwuu, Senior Brother\u2026 I thought you didn\u2019t want me anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Yan? Why was she also here? And why was she crying?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was confused. Her eyes whirled as she tried to come up with a way to see what Nangong Yan was doing when another familiar, slightly low voice spoke. \u201cHow could that be possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s heart squeezed as she looked at the wall in front of her with disbelief. She was so stunned she couldn\u2019t even move.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

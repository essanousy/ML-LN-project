They\u2019re about to leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked up and glanced over at those black-clothed men. They really were leaving.</p><br/><p>However, right at this time, the sounds of clashing blades came from outside.</p><br/><p>The black-clothed men looked at each other, then hastily rushed out.</p><br/><p>When the leader of the black-clothed group reached the door and saw the situation outside, he glanced back into the room and said, \u201cWe\u2019re been discovered! Kill all possible witnesses!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after he said that, the black-robed people that were originally rushing out immediately drew their blades and swung them towards the people on the bed.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no way that Jun Xin would allow them to succeed. He extended his hand and the faint blue antique lamp floated up into the air. With a wave of his hand, numerous rays of blue light shot out and shattered the blades into shards.</p><br/><p>The black-clothed men were stunned. They seemed surprised about encountering such a high-leveled expert in this worn out inn.</p><br/><p>However, they were evidently well trained as they immediately came back to their senses and drew out their spare blades to approach the bed in formation.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin exclaimed in surprise, \u201cFlowing Clouds Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>When those people heard this name, they rushed to attack him like a cat that had gotten its tail stomped on.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had probably hit the nail on the head, thought Tang Doudou. Then she quickly pushed Jun Xin off her and pulled on her outer robe as she asked, \u201cThey all seem quite skilled. What do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Jun Xin shot her a \u2018relax\u2019 look, then the antique lamp became a streak of blue light and quickly zigzagged past those people. When it stopped, the black-clothed people that had come in to kill them collapsed onto the ground, dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough their martial arts aren\u2019t bad, it\u2019s still not good enough.\u201d Jun Xin glanced disdainfully at the corpses on the ground before picking up what was left of a sword to flick away the clothes concealing those people\u2019s features.</p><br/><p>They had all died with blood pouring out of their noses and mouths. Beneath the faint, blue light, it was a very eerie sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people are pretty good-looking?\u201d To Tang Doudou\u2019s surprise, the black-clothed men weren\u2019t burly men but very delicate and beautiful-looking men with looks similar to the male courtesans in the pleasure quarters.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou recalled what Baili Yiling said about Flowing Clouds Palace sending her men, she finally understood. Flowing Clouds Palace probably specialized in nurturing bottoms!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a few of them too. What exactly were they looking for?\u201d Jun Xin put away the antique lamp and the entire room became darker.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was pretty curious as well. \u201cIsn\u2019t Flowing Clouds Palace an orthodox group? Why would they do something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlowing Clouds Palace didn\u2019t even visit your Alliance Head Residence to pay their greetings, so what right do they have to call themselves orthodox? In addition, they\u2019re always raising young and delicate-looking youths and sending to them people in the martial arts communities that have a fondness for good-looking men.\u201d When Flowing Clouds Palace was brought up, Jun Xin\u2019s tsundere face looked even more ticked off than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Well, there\u2019s nothing else for us to do now so let\u2019s go back to sleep?\u201d Tang Doudou glanced outside and saw that it was probably only around midnight, so she yawned and turned to lay back down.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t stop her and just walked over to throw the corpses out the window. He listened to the screams and sounds of fighting coming from outside for a while, then glanced at Tang Doudou and said teasingly, \u201cHey, you\u2019re the martial arts Alliance Head, how could you just sit back and do nothing to stop this kind of situation? You\u2019ll be denounced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they want to denounce me, they can. In any case, I\u2019m not interested in being some crappy martial arts Alliance Head.\u201d All she cared about right now was finding Baili Yu. She had no interest in anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin replied softly and crossed his arms as he stood by the door.</p><br/><p>Desperate screams continued to fill the night. Over half of the people in this inn were probably innocent people. Flowing Clouds Palace was too much. Since they had been discovered, they should\u2019ve just run. Killing people like this was senseless and cruel.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pushed herself up from the bed and rushed outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo save those people!\u201d Tang Doudou rolled her eyes at him. It was obvious that he had been inciting her to act.</p><br/><p>She understood as well that although she didn\u2019t want to be the martial arts Alliance Head, a certain person wanted her to remain in that position.</p><br/><p>Since that person wanted her in this position, he probably wouldn\u2019t let her abandon this post easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to become strong enough to stand on your own so that people can no longer lead you around by the nose, you should take advantage of every good opportunity to build up your own reputation and slowly establish your own influence and power\u2026\u201d said Jun Xin quickly as she walked past.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was stunned. This had been his plan?</p><br/><p>Then her eyes flickered. Jun Xin was right. If she wanted to stand steadily in this messy Jianghu, having power of her own was very important. However, she was completely unfamiliar with how to handle these matters so she had no idea where to start.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin reached out and pressed her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

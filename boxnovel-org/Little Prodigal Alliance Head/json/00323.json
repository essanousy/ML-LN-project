If it is something this Gu knows, this Gu will definitely answer in detail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t ask directly and instead said with a smile, \u201cBoss Gu is a businessman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Xun reacted as if he just recalled this. \u201cYes, I am a businessman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Gu, I\u2019ve always been very straightforward in my speech, I\u2019m not much for tactful dealings.\u201d As Tang Doudou spoke, she observed Gu Xun\u2019s expression carefully. However, his guard was too strong so she couldn\u2019t read him at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li means?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you want? Why don\u2019t you just state it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li is overthinking things. There\u2019s nothing that this Gu wants. This Gu just saved Baili gongzi in consideration of our friendship.\u201d Gu Xun chuckled, then glanced over at Baili Yu who seemed to be sleeping. \u201cAs of now, Baili gongzi has not only lost his memories, but his martial arts as well. Forgive my rudeness, but I\u2019d like to ask what you plan to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I plan to do?\u201d Tang Doudou understood what he meant now. He wanted some useful information before he would reveal what exactly he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I plan to bring him back to Huai City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t be easy.\u201d Gu Xun glanced at Tang Doudou. \u201cNot only has that person from before been seeking an opportunity to attack this entire time, lately the Jianghu has been abuzz with rumors that the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce was about to change hands. Both matters are a great threat to Baili gongzi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeng Xuan Chamber of Commerce is about to change hands? Who said this?\u201d Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. She could tell that Gu Xun was about to give her shocking news.</p><br/><p>She had been too busy rushing here these last three months so she hadn\u2019t paid attention to the news being passed around the Jianghu at all. If these rumors were going around, it was no wonder Jun Xin had been gone for such a long time.</p><br/><p>He had probably gone to deal with this incident.</p><br/><p>However, leaving without a word wasn\u2019t his style.</p><br/><p>He had always been very indifferent to the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce as well, so would he really return just due to this matter?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something I heard from someone, this news was spread by one of Baili gongzi\u2018s three generals, Yun Hai.\u201d Gu Xun actually did have something he needed Tang Doudou\u2019s help with, so he had brought Baili Yu back with ulterior motives. However, when this matter was brought up, he stopped smiling and became very serious. \u201cAlliance Head Li is aware that three months ago, Plum Garden released news of the return of Baili Yu\u2019s younger sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. \u201cAre you talking about Yiling? That\u2019s not possible, Yiling wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Baili Yiling was shrewd and had strange ways, she sincerely cared about Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t do that sort of thing, especially when she still didn\u2019t know if Baili Yu was alive or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d Gu Xun glanced at Tang Doudou curiously. \u201cAlliance Head Li had been back to Huai City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou knew that this wasn\u2019t the time to keep secrets so she nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t keep it from Boss Gu, I had come this time from Huai City. I\u2019m very good friends with Baili Yiling so I\u2019m certain that based on how much she respects Baili Yu, she would never do something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the discussion was approaching the other person\u2019s family members, normally Gu Xun would stop asking about it. However, this was currently quite an important question, thus he paused for a moment to take a sip from the wine before looking up and asking, \u201cIs that lady really Baili gongzi\u2018s biological younger sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, Baili Yu has once acknowledged it himself.\u201d As Tang Doudou spoke, she glanced over towards Baili Yu and saw that he had already opened his eyes. His expression seemed to show recognition of this younger sister.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you remember something?\u201d asked Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu shook his head. \u201cNo, I just feel that this name is very familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he turned towards Gu Xun. \u201cBoss Gu, Yiling is definitely my younger sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Baili Yu had said it himself, this news was definitely true.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun sighed. \u201cThen this really will be troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Gu, what exactly happened? Things were clearly fine when I left? And I hadn\u2019t heard that Yun Hai had come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m an outsider, so I\u2019m not clear about the details either. However, Alliance Head Li, it would probably be good for you to take note of Yun Hai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter he returned, he immediately released the news that Baili gongzi was already\u2026\u201d Gu Xun glanced at Baili Yu, then sighed. \u201cThis is the reason why I hadn\u2019t dared to send Baili gongzi back. Several people have came to investigate Hibiscus Garrison as well. It\u2019s only because Wind Cherishing House was a small brothel that it managed to avoid suspicion. This is also why I had no choice but to have Baili gongzi act as Escort Xue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li, you must believe me. Even if you hadn\u2019t appeared tonight, Escort Xue still wouldn\u2019t have been sold. I only did this to dispel the suspicions of those who are keeping an eye on this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lifted her brows. \u201cI understand the reasoning, but why did you expose my identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t exposed you in front of everyone, you probably would\u2019ve ran off with Baili gongzi already instead of sitting here calmly to drink tea with me.\u201d A calculating expression flashed through Gu Xun\u2019s eyes, then he lifted his cup. \u201cI\u2019ll drink this cup in apology. I hope that Alliance Head Li would take into consideration the fact that I had no other choice and not hold this against me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he tilted his head back and finished the drink in one go.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sighed. What was the point of holding it against him now?</p><br/><p>However, he had sure dealt a ruthless attack. Now that her identity was revealed under these circumstances, the news would definitely spread across the entire Jianghu by tomorrow. Not only would people know where she currently was, they\u2019d definitely be curious about the courtesan that she had spent two hundred thousand on. There would tons of people rushing to Hibiscus Garrison by tomorrow morning.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou quietly took a sip of the tea. \u201cThere are only a few people in Huai City who knows that something has happened to Baili Yu. There\u2019s only me, Jun Xin, Bai Feiyun, Baili Yiling, Feng Long, and Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>\u201cOut of these people, the one I distrust the most is Feng Long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably not her,\u201d said Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. \u201cIt can\u2019t be the rest of us, so the only possibility is Nangong Yan\u2019s group.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Xun asked in surprise, \u201cNangong Yan? Wind Cloud Island Master\u2019s daughter? Why is she involved in this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t Boss Gu saved Baili Yu from their hands? How is it possible that you don\u2019t know them?\u201d Tang Doudou smiled. \u201cIn addition, hasn\u2019t that person been waiting outside Wind Cherishing House this entire time? Boss Gu isn\u2019t actually unaware, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Xun smiled. \u201cSo it was them.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

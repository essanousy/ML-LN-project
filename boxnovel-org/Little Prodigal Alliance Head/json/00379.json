He thought that she would try to delay things until Baili Yu got back before heading out. She only dared to act so unbridled when that person was by her side after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Young Master Jun, for telling me. It seems that I should head to Barbarian Mound Garrison to look for her.\u201d Bai Feiyun smiled faintly and was about to turn when he sensed a burst of movement. His expression turned serious and his figure quickly moved with a flash to the center of the courtyard. He looked back at Jun Xin who was casually lowering his fist and asked, \u201cWhat does Young Master Jun mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin laughed. \u201cNothing much. I just wanted to exchange some pointers with Bai gongzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He continued looking at Jun Xin, then said slowly, \u201cYou\u2019re blaming me for that injury from last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi had helped treat my injury last time. I can\u2019t even thank you enough, how could I blame you?\u201d Jun Xin smoothed away some of his loose hair as he silently remarked that this fake gentleman was actually pretty sharp.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun said, \u201cIf Young Master Jun holds a grudge against me because of that matter, there\u2019s no need to try to talk around the matter. This one won\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin inwardly scoffed. All smart people didn\u2019t bother to deny what they did. \u201cBai gongzi is truly refreshingly straightforward, however! I really don\u2019t mean to blame you, I\u2019m just curious, you see. There\u2019s no past grudges between us, but Bai gongzi actually used the third of the ten strangest poisons on me. In my free time, I couldn\u2019t help but be puzzled over it. Although I\u2019m not that good of a person, it\u2019s not to the point that everyone in the world wants to kill me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason he put things this way was because he wanted Bai Feiyun to explain why he used the poison. However, Bai Feiyun just said, \u201cYoung Master Jun is putting things too heavily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin couldn\u2019t help but be irritated. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he ate the heart of the Black Demonic Nightcrawler and became immune to a hundred poisons, he probably would\u2019ve died the moment the poison was applied to his arm.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t an ordinary poison. All ten of the ten strangest poisons were highly toxic and travel through the bloodstream in seconds. Many of the antidotes have already been lost to history, so it was absolutely fatal.</p><br/><p>He had already put this fatal poison lightly, so how could it be said that he put things too heavily?</p><br/><p>However, it then occurred to him that although the poison was fatal, it wouldn\u2019t do much to someone who was immune to a hundred poisons, so the way he put it was a little heavy.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, he had already figured out the crux of the matter and was a little surprised. \u201cBai gongzi knows that I\u2019m immune to a hundred poisons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was treating your injury, I saw that your blood was a little strange so I figured out that you were immune to a hundred poisons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I\u2019m immune, your conduct is still to strange.\u201d Jun Xin glanced at Bai Feiyun as he rubbed his chin. If he asked straight out what it was that caused his change, would he answer?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun laughed softly. \u201cThis one truly was a little rash in doing that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t plan to explain?\u201d Jun Xin\u2019s intuition told him that Bai Feiyun\u2019s strange actions were definitely related to this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to explain. If Young Master Jun is still angry, you can just poison this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sure had guts!</p><br/><p>Any of the poisons in Jun Xin\u2019s possession could cause instant death. After all, how could the ten strangest poisons compare to the strange poisons of the Seven Great Saint Tribes?</p><br/><p>It was obvious from the examples of the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance and the Hoarfrost Poison that most of these poisons truly had no antidotes.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin chuckled. It seemed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get answers today. Since he still needed to follow after Tang Doudou, he just gave a disdainful humph and said, \u201cAm I that sort of person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun smiled and sorted out his clothes slightly before cupping his fist in salute. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, this one will be leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he gracefully turned and had Xiao Ren and Xiao Yi open the doors. It was only after his figure disappeared into the bamboo forest that Jun Xin looked away.</p><br/><p>What exactly was Bai Feiyun\u2018s true personality like?</p><br/><p>Outside of Azure Water Valley, a large orderly procession that was scarlet, then purple, then deeper colors was moving through the endless sea of flowers. It was beautiful, except for the random mix of other colors in this otherwise harmonious procession.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou, who was riding on a horse with the heads of the four large clans, glanced back at the undisciplined Murong family from time to time and frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>On her left was Bai Luoqing. Her beautiful hazy eyes were looking in this direction. When she saw that Tang Doudou had glanced back multiple times, she asked with a delicate laugh, \u201cAlliance Head, are you reluctant to leave Azure Water Valley? You\u2019ve turned back so many times that I feel bad for making you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The silence that had hung over them this entire time was disrupted by Bai Luoqing\u2019s voice. Tang Doudou looked towards her. Intuition told her that Bai Luoqing had intentions towards her.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t romantic intentions. She seemed to be trying to make a good impression in order to get something from her.</p><br/><p>However, she also seemed reluctant about it, so she had also been trying to cause a bit of trouble for her from time to time. Tang Doudou could sometimes see a conflicted expression in Bai Luoqing\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>But when she thought about it, she and Bai Luoqing lived completely different lives and had never interacted with each other before. As the master of the Bai Clan, there was nothing that Bai Luoqing wanted that she couldn\u2019t have. In comparison, she was just a commander in name that happened to get an honorable title. Other than that, she had nothing.</p><br/><p>So Tang Doudou was mulling over what exactly Bai Luoqing was trying to get from her when she heard another amused remark. \u201cI think it\u2019s that Alliance Head can\u2019t bear to leave Baili gongzi, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She glanced back and saw that Lin Shuxuan had caught up with them. Next to him was Xiao Siyuan and Xiao Yi.</p><br/><p>Xiao Siyuan gave her a polite smile as if he had already forgotten about how she sealed his pressure points that night.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Xiao Yi kept glancing at her with a strange expression as if he felt guilty about something but didn\u2019t want to face it.</p><br/><p>There was also a very quiet young man with them. He seemed younger than the other three but the feeling he gave off was that he was much more mature and reserved.</p><br/><p>She immediately came to the conclusion that this young man was from the Murong family since that gloominess seemed to be a trademark of the Murong family.</p><br/><p>However, due to the fact that this young man wasn\u2019t very old, that trace of gloominess wasn\u2019t very off putting and seemed more like worry. In addition, he had a tear-shaped mole at the corner of his eye, so it just made him seem doleful.</p><br/><p>Since she hadn\u2019t seen this young man before and he was a little unique, she couldn\u2019t help but take a couple more glances. However, those few looks actually made the young man\u2019s face turn red. Xiao Siyuan said something and he hastily went back to the Murong family group and stayed there without daring to look this way.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry as she touched her own face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

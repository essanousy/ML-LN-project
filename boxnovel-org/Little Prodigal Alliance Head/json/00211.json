It probably wasn\u2019t far from Cang Baicao\u2019s residence. She knew that because she had strolled through the streets when she had been staying in Cang Baicao\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>However, for the sake of quickly and accurately finding the place, she ran to the vendor stalls and asked for directions.</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin saw that she wasn\u2019t planning to look for Baili Yu and actually had been worrying about his injury, that trace of pain in his heart immediately disappeared. He pressed on his arm with one hand and followed after her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, thanks!\u201d By the time Jun Xin got over there, Tang Doudou had already finished asking for directions and was smiling while thanking the person repeatedly with bows. When she turned around and saw that Jun Xin was behind her, she said, \u201cHehe, I\u2019ve already gotten the directions. Let\u2019s go, Big Sister will take you to get your injury treated!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she moved to pull Jun Xin\u2019s hand. Halfway through the motion, she recalled his injury and hastily retrieved her hand again and put it behind her back. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin nodded and walked forward with her.</p><br/><p>This time they didn\u2019t have to walk for long before they reached a street that Tang Doudou was extremely familiar with. Following that, they rushed for a while before finally reaching Cang Baicao\u2019s residence doors. Tang Doudou went up and slapped on the door a few times, then the door opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head? Why are you here?\u201d Bai Feiyun had opened the door. When he saw Tang Doudou, surprise flashed through his eyes, then he questioned her gently.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pulled Jun Xin over. \u201cThis kid got injured while trying to save me. Is Senior Cang here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Another person tried to kill you?\u201d Bai Feiyun\u2019s expression turned serious as he moved out of the way. \u201cSenior Cang is still engrossed in investigating the matter regarding the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be easy to get him out in a short time. You guys should come in first, I can take a look at his injury.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat works!\u201d She had heard them say earlier that Bai Feiyun\u2019s current medical expertise was in no way inferior to Cang Baicao\u2019s. In addition, Jun Xin\u2019s injury was only a knife wound so it wasn\u2019t a severe problem. Hence she immediately pulled Jun Xin along and walked in.</p><br/><p>She was walking in front, so she didn\u2019t notice that Jun Xin had looked at Bai Feiyun with a bit of suspicion.</p><br/><p>Once the three went in, Bai Feiyun had Jun Xin take off his upper garment. Jun Xin glanced at Tang Doudou, then took out a small knife and, with a few slashes, made all the cloth that made up his sleeve fall to the ground in pieces, revealing the injury within.</p><br/><p>So simple and crude. Tang Doudou was pretty speechless, but then immediately poked her head over to look. When she saw that horrifying injury, her anger flared up again. \u201cSooner or later I\u2019ll pay her back for these two stabs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was Nangong Yan\u2019s doing again?\u201d Bai Feiyun got out the necessary items, then indicated for Jun Xin to sit down. He took in Tang Doudou\u2019s furious expression and asked her questions as he started dealing with the wound.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her nose and said in a depressed tone, \u201cWho else other than her would have such big guts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe indeed has a lot of guts,\u201d replied Bai Feiyun mildly. \u201cYoung Master Jun\u2019s wound didn\u2019t injure his meridians, so he\u2019ll be fine after medicine is applied and a few days of rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou also felt that something was off when she saw Bai Feiyun\u2019s expressionless manner. Although Bai Feiyun had always been quite cold and indifferent, he had never treated her coldly. Sometimes he would even mock her with a few sharp remarks. When had he become like this?</p><br/><p>It seemed like Bai Feiyun had become a bit distant from her ever since they got to Cloud City.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Forget it, it was best if she didn\u2019t ask. She then propped up her chin as she watched Bai Feiyun apply medicine on Jun Xin\u2019s injury. \u201cThen is there a need to avoid certain foods?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she was recovering earlier, she had to avoid quite a lot of food. Su Yi was often like, you can\u2019t eat this and you can\u2019t eat that.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. The injury isn\u2019t serious, so it\u2019ll be fine just to abstain from too much alcohol and pepper if you don\u2019t want it to leave a scar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going back to the City Lord Residence?\u201d asked Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Only then did Tang Doudou look up to check the color of the sky. She scratched her head, and after hesitating awhile, stood up and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll head back first. I\u2019ll have to trouble you with Jun Xin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send you back!\u201d Unexpectedly, when Jun Xin heard that she was going to leave, he hastily stood up and the medicine that had just been applied fell all over the table.</p><br/><p>A trace of annoyance flashed through Bai Feiyun\u2019s eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m a kid. Moreover, it isn\u2019t very far away, I\u2019ll be able to get there in a few steps. You should just let Xiao Bai finish dealing with your wound. I\u2019ll come to find you to play again tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a small injury, its insignificant.\u201d Jun Xin was persistent. \u201cA lot of things can happen in the time of a few steps. In any case, I\u2019m about to head back to the place I\u2019m staying too, since Yuner is still waiting. I\u2019ll just walk with you since it\u2019s on the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was about to try to dissuade him again when Bai Feiyun interjected, \u201cYoung Master Jun, even if you want to send the Alliance Head back, you still need to have this insignificant injury treated first. Otherwise, it\u2019ll end up very troublesome later.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he looked towards Tang Doudou. \u201cAlliance Head isn\u2019t in a rush either, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Young Master Jun, please sit down.\u201d</p><br/><p>After half an incense stick\u2019s time, Bai Feiyun saw the two off at the door. Tang Doudou waved towards him as she said, \u201cXiao Bai, we\u2019re leaving now. You should head back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun nodded. \u201cAlright. Be careful heading back. If the wound seems abnormal, remember to hurry and come look for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could anything abnormal happen when his medical expertise was that good? Tang Doudou waved goodbye at him without minding his words and left with Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>A strange cold smile appeared on Bai Feiyun\u2019s face after they left. He looked towards the piece of gauze still in his hand. With a slight shake, it turned into powder and spilled down through the gaps between his fingers.</p><br/><p>The City Lord Residence was truly not very far from Cang Baicao\u2019s residence, but it also wasn\u2019t as close as being only a couple steps away like Tang Doudou had said. They had to walk through two long streets, then turn left into a wide alley. The residence with a rather stronger imposing aura compared to that of the neighboring residences in the middle of the alley on the right side was the City Lord Residence.</p><br/><p>When she thought about it, she also felt that she had been pretty stupid back then. How did she end up believing Nangong Yan\u2019s words? And she even helped her block those people. If she had discovered that something was off back then, she probably could\u2019ve escaped with her qinggong.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, a lot of things couldn\u2019t be completely blamed on others. One also had to properly reflect on their actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve reached the door. You\u2019re finally at ease now, right?\u201d Why had she never noticed before that Jun Xin was so fastidious? However, since he was doing this to ensure her safety, she decided to treat this kid more nicely in the future!</p><br/><p>\u201cStinkin\u2019 woman, be more careful when you head out in the future. Hurry up and go in! This little master is also tired and will be going back to rest!\u201d Jun Xin folded his arms. He shouldn\u2019t be misunderstood for trying to act cool. The reality was that his injury was itching like crazy. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he had good self-control, he would have already reached over to scratch it. However, he didn\u2019t want Tang Doudou to worry so he could only force himself to endure it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I\u2019m heading in now. You should go back and properly rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>The doors of the City Lord Residence weren\u2019t tightly closed like the way they had been in the past. From the looks of it, this was Su Yi\u2019s doing. He was making it so that it was easier for her to return.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sighed. Su Yi truly did treat her very well.</p><br/><p>After walking a few steps, she suddenly stopped again and turned around. \u201cJun Xin, thank you for today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was originally about to scratch his wound now that she was leaving. When he saw her turn around out of the corner of his eye, he hastily tried to put his hand back down but before he could she had already turned around completely. He hastily changed the direction of his hand and scratched the back of his head as he forced a couple laughs. \u201cAhem, this young master was just meddling out of boredom, no need to be so polite\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou saw that he was giving a very bright fake smile and silently cursed \u2018butt-aged brat\u2019 before turning to walk into the City Lord Residence.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

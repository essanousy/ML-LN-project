When you meet him later, don\u2019t mistake him for Bai Feiyun.\u201d Baili Yu seemed to still be unaware that she knew Gu Xun, as he warned her when they were almost about to reach Gu Residence.</p><br/><p>Naturally Tang Doudou feigned surprise and purposefully asked, \u201cThen why is Gu Xun\u2019s surname Gu and Bai Feiyun\u2019s surname Bai?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain to you in detail after we get back. We\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, do you still remember how you got to Mist City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course Tang Doudou remembered, but she didn\u2019t say anything and waited for Baili Yu to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Xun is a famous human trafficker in Mist City. It was one of his people that drugged you. I\u2019ve done some investigation into this incident. It\u2019s likely due to the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance that we were able to wake up earlier from that drug so it\u2019s likely that the person who made the drug is connected somehow to the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance. I\u2019m bringing you to see Gu Xun today in order to find out from him where that person is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he talking about Old Suo?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou thought about it a little and felt that Baili Yu\u2019s guess was very logical. What else could explain why the only people that ever woke up on their own from Old Suo\u2019s drug were Baili Yu and her?</p><br/><p>The only thing they had in common was that they\u2019ve both been poisoned with Disseminating Tassel Fragrance before.</p><br/><p>If Old Suo really was connected to the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, then didn\u2019t that mean there was hope for curing the poison?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately became excited when this thought occurred to her. In her excitement, she recalled that Su Yi had taken the booklet to Baili Yu yesterday. \u201cDid you look at the booklet Su Yi gave you last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu seemed to have predicted that she would bring this up. He nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ve looked at it. It is indeed the way to cure the Hoarfrost Poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when do you plan to cure the poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no rush.\u201dT/N</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou still wanted to ask more about it but Baili Yu had already stood up. \u201cWe\u2019re here. Head out first, we can talk more about this later.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, Tang Doudou felt like Baili Yu seemed to be avoiding this matter. Could it be that he didn\u2019t want to cure the Hoarfrost Poison?</p><br/><p>But if he didn\u2019t want to cure it, why did he go to Azure Water Valley last time?</p><br/><p>To play?</p><br/><p>While she was caught up in confusion, Baili Yu had already left the palanquin. Before she even got out she heard Su Yi noisily challenging Baili Yu to a duel.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou imagined the scene of Baili Yu, Su Yi, and Gu Xun sitting together, she suddenly no longer wanted to get off the palanquin.</p><br/><p>However, she couldn\u2019t choose not to get off the palanquin. Baili Yu didn\u2019t say anything, he probably didn\u2019t want to bother with Su Yi. Su Yi, on the other hand, insisted on picking a fight with Baili Yu. When he saw that Baili Yu was ignoring him, he ran to the door of the palanquin and noisily cried out for Tang Doudou to come out and take charge of justice.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was extremely speechless upon hearing this. He was looking for her to take charge of justice in a fight between two grown men? Was Su Yi really not the Dou Bi Monkey invited over?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t they say that the Lord of a City was supposed to be cold and dignified?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wondered how Su Yi was able to manage Cloud City with this sort of temperament. It\u2019s likely that there was no one in Cloud City that dared to confront him head-on. No wonder that old guy, Cang Baicao, said that those people were getting restless now that Su Yi didn\u2019t regularly return to Cloud City.</p><br/><p>Who would want a superior like this who could explode at any time and beat someone up?</p><br/><p>For one, she didn\u2019t want it. When there was time she had better talk to Baili Yu and have him think of a way to get her out of going to Cloud City. Although Su Yi had yet to do anything scary to her, but what if?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou slowly got off the palanquin while still worrying.</p><br/><p>The moment she got out, Su Yi pulled her to the side. \u201cLater when you enter, don\u2019t sit with him. No matter what you\u2019re the Alliance Head of the martial arts circles, how could you act like his little servant girl all day? It\u2019s so undignified!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was speechless. She didn\u2019t have much interest in being the Alliance Head of the martial arts circles at all. Moreover, how many people in the Jianghu truly regarded her as the martial arts Alliance Head? Rather than trying to put on airs, it would be better to just act like Baili Yu\u2019s little servant girl. Didn\u2019t he see how much respect Qing Yin got when she went to the Alliance Head Residence?</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be pretty good if the position of martial arts Alliance Head was given to Xiao Bai?\u201d The meaning in those words was, hurry and give the position of Alliance Head to Bai Feiyun and return her freedom!</p><br/><p>Su Yi rolled his eyes at her. \u201cYou wish! Even if you\u2019re about to die you\u2019re still not allowed to casually give this Alliance Head position to someone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

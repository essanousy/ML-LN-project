But, right now, the top priority was to resolve this current matter as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>When Qing Xin heard what Qing Yin said, her graceful brows slightly knitted, \u201cQing Yin, what nonsense are you saying!?\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter what the Masters do, it\u2019s not their place as servants to guess their intentions. Other than consoling, it\u2019s best for them not to be too talkative. If they provoked the Masters and caused them to be unhappy, the ones that must bear the punishment would be them, the servants.</p><br/><p>These things were all things Qing Yin had said to them sisters. In the past, it was also Qing Yin who handled matters the best; that was why Baili Yu would often bring Qing Yin along when he headed out.</p><br/><p>But why is it that right now, she would choose to ignore the customs?</p><br/><p>Her eyes shifted again and her gaze landed on Tang Doudou. It must be because of Li Xueyi. It was only ever since Qing Yin started serving Li Xueyi that she became so strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Bai, this servant has something to boldly ask. Why was Miss in Snow Building?\u201d Qing Yin ignored Qing Xin\u2019s words and looked directly at Miss Bai.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin was one of the most competent maids that served Baili gege. Even though her own status wasn\u2019t normal, she still couldn\u2019t casually offend Qing Yin.</p><br/><p>So she immediately started weeping with soft sobs, \u201cI-I also, it\u2019s because I also heard that Baili gege wasn\u2019t in Snow Building and my entire body was so dirty it felt uncomfortable, that\u2019s why I had Qing Xin bring me over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin\u2019s expression was unsympathetic. She had been serving Master the longest and she had long since seen so much of these kinds of schemes that she had gotten tired of them. For Qing Xin not to know was very normal; at the start she had also been muddled, she only began to slowly see through it after being exposed to it for a while.</p><br/><p>In reality, the one she was worried about was Tang Doudou. Would he be deceived by this Miss Bai\u2019s outwardly innocent appearance?</p><br/><p>As she thought about it, she glanced at Tang Doudou and saw the latter looking at Miss Bai with both eyes emitting light. It was like when a starving dog saw feces; those eyes were filled with the desire to pounce over and smack kisses until satisfied!</p><br/><p>Eh, too disgusting. Qing Yin hurriedly retrieved her thoughts. After this thought, when she looked at that Miss Bai again, she felt more and more disgusted by her.</p><br/><p>Then she aimed her faintly angry gaze at Tang Doudou for a moment. Looks like as long as it\u2019s a man, they wouldn\u2019t be able to escape Miss Bai\u2019s bewitchment ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster has never liked anyone coming to Snow Building, could it be that Miss Bai didn\u2019t know?\u201d She couldn\u2019t bear to scold Tang Doudou so she could only direct her criticism towards Miss Bai.</p><br/><p>Miss Bai also felt pretty depressed. In the past, no matter how much Qing Yin disliked her, she still wouldn\u2019t directly expose her with pointed words like this. How come she insists on repeatedly pressing her today?</p><br/><p>Unless\u2026 Miss Bai\u2019s gaze also moved towards Tang Doudou just in time to bump into Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes which were emitting light. The frank(explicit of sex) gaze frightened her and she immediately retrieved her gaze.</p><br/><p>This man is too frightening!</p><br/><p>Ignoring him, Miss Bai slightly bit her cherry lips whilst her eyes turned faintly red, \u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Qing Xin couldn\u2019t watch on anymore, \u201cQing Yin, I was the one who brought Miss Bai over. This morning Master said he was going to the Wind Building. And since all the other buildings were already closed by Master\u2019s order, I could only bring Miss Bai over here to Snow Building.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so many guest houses in the garden, all of which are ready for guests at any time. Why did you have to bring her, of all places, to Snow Building? And to even let her bathe inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Qing Xin couldn\u2019t reply. Back then, she had also suggested going to a guest room but Miss Bai refused. Miss Bai had wanted to go to Snow Building, saying that there was no one inside and bathing wouldn\u2019t take long anyways. Qing Xin thought it wouldn\u2019t be of much importance so she agreed and brought Miss Bai over.</p><br/><p>Looking at Qing Xin\u2019s expression, Qing Yin was already able to surmise pretty much the whole situation. She said to Qing Xin: \u201cAs long as Miss Bai doesn\u2019t spread this matter, I will naturally help you hide this matter and keep Master from finding out.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking to here, everything was already made as clear as it could be. The only thing left was to see what Miss Bai and Qing Xin chose.</p><br/><p>No one present desired for this matter to be known. Thus, when they heard Qing Yin\u2019s suggestion they immediately went silent as they considered the pros and the cons.</p><br/><p>Miss Bai was the very first to react. She still had on that delicate and fragile act as Qing Xin helped her up. Tightening the clothes around her body, she said: \u201cWhen Li gongzi burst in I had already finished bathing. He, he didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, she even lowered her eyes. Her long eyelashes faintly trembled, giving off the impression that she was holding back her tears after suffering a great wrong.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded like a chick pecking rice grains and hurriedly added, \u201cYes yes yes! Miss Bai is right, I didn\u2019t see anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Qing Yin furrowed her brows and pulled Tang Doudou over, \u201cSince it\u2019s like that, then let\u2019s just leave it at this. Li gongzi, don\u2019t you still need to see Master regarding a matter? Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being reminded by Qing Yin like this, Tang Doudou immediately recalled her proper business. But when her gaze swept over Miss Bai, she paused again. From their conversation just now, it seems she had misunderstood. This Miss Bai wasn\u2019t Baili Yu\u2019s little pampered darling at all but actually just one of Baili Yu\u2019s admirers.</p><br/><p>Cough, then just now, weren\u2019t her expressions of goodwill a waste of energy?</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it caused her to feel upset. In the end, the best option was to traverse the honest and straight route. For now, let\u2019s just go look for Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Since Miss Bai is so highly principled, I also won\u2019t act unreasonable either. While green hills change not, clear water flows long*. Let us meet again someday!\u201d Tang Doudou grinned at Miss Bai. Even though this wasn\u2019t Baili Yu\u2019s pampered little darling, but she\u2019s still full of potential ah. Perhaps one day she\u2019ll rise up to occupy the position!</p><br/><p>While the green hills remain, the fresh water will continue to flow without changing, which can signify that hatred or feelings of friendship also won\u2019t ever change. It can also signify eternity, the world will go on for a long time so there will always be the chance to meet again. In this case, it was probably the latter meeting as she does end with a Chinese saying that\u2019s pretty much, we\u2019ll meet again.</p><br/><p>This relationship ah, has to be built well! Perhaps one day it\u2019ll come in useful.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin found the scene unpleasant to watch, so she pulled Tang Doudou and headed outside. When they got to the door, Qing Xin suddenly called out to her, \u201cQing Yin, Miss Bai is also looking for Master for a matter. I have to clean up here, so can I trouble you to bring Miss Bai over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin decisively wanted to refuse. To want her to go find Master together with Miss Bai? She\u2019d rather go die.</p><br/><p>But before this sentence could even come out of her mouth, Tang Doudou, who was completely ignorant of the situation, immediately replied refreshingly: \u201cOkay! Let\u2019s just go together, no problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin turned furious.</p><br/><p>But she really had no way out. Shaking her head, she didn\u2019t look at Tang Doudou anymore and angrily rushed downstairs.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin, not knowing which door of moodiness Qing Yin was heading towards.</p><br/><p>Women ah, their moods are seriously hard to guess.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to trouble Li gongzi to wait outside for a moment. Once I finish tidying up I\u2019ll come out to look for gongzi.\u201d Miss Bai curtsied. Her movements were graceful, warming the heart and delighting the eye.</p><br/><p>Before a woman heads out she does have to tidy up her appearance a bit. Tang Doudou had a rather deep understanding of this from experience, \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll wait outside for you. Ahem, time\u2019s a bit tight so remember to hurry up a little!\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, she even winked towards the person before laughing loudly with \u2018haha\u2019s and swaggering off.</p><br/><p>Inside the room. How is this behavior like a normal man?! Tang Doudou\u2019s vulgar appearance and behavior caused Qing Xin to feel extreme disdain and despise towards him. Furthermore, she didn\u2019t know what happened to Qing Yin jie, for her to protect Tang Doudou so much.</p><br/><p>Retrieving her gaze, she glanced at Miss Bai\u2019s pitiful appearance and all the anger rose up at once, \u201cMiss Bai, we\u2019ve caused you to suffer grievances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Xin, Li gongzi is Baili gege\u2019s guest. I\u2019m also just doing this for Baili gege\u2019s sake. I\u2019m alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d Qing Xin supported her as she helped take off her coat and brush her hair, \u201cMiss Bai, Qing Xin has something she doesn\u2019t know whether she should say straight out or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Bai lowered her eyes, \u201cQing Xin, if there\u2019s anything, you can just say it directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since Li gongzi came to the garden, Master has treated Li gongzi very specially. Now even Qing Yin jie is partial towards him so Miss Bai must be careful and be on guard against him!\u201d Qing Xin repeated all the rumors in the garden, then continued, \u201cHe also seems to have a lot of tricks. Even Young Master Jun has spoken up multiple times for his sake and there\u2019s even a rumor that Young Master Jun would go to his room every night\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d Hearing this, Miss Bai couldn\u2019t remain unperturbed anymore. The expression on her face twisted slightly, \u201cYou said Young Master Jun goes to his room every day? What does he go there to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Xin said: \u201cWhat else could he do if not that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you hear this from!? How could Young Master Jun be that type of person!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why ah, that\u2019s why I said that Li gongzi was especially abnormal.\u201d Qing Xin clicked her tongue, \u201cIt is said that Qing Yin jie even walked in on the two while they were being intimate. But we also don\u2019t know how it was handled because Young Master Jun actually spared Qing Yin jie and didn\u2019t make her take punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, enough. These are just winds from an empty cave and not very founded on facts so you should speak of them less.\u201d Even though Miss Bai said this, she was very envious. Back then she invested so much effort in pursuing Jun Xin, yet that guy was simply like a wooden block: insensitive to the point of blindness. He even teased her time and time again, angering her to the point her heart hurt until finally, she saw Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Yet now, Jun Xin actually fell in love with a man, and it\u2019s even a man like this. Thinking to here, Miss Bai\u2019s mood was extremely tangled. How laughable. He was the man she had fought over with so many young ladies, yet the one she had to be jealous of now was actually a man! What kind of situation was this!?</p><br/><p>When she retrieved her thoughts, Qing Xin had also just finished combing her hair, \u201cI\u2019ll head over first. I\u2019ll have to trouble you regarding this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Bai, don\u2019t mention it. Hurry and go find Master. Tidying up and these kinds of matters are all duties that Qing Xin is supposed to do.\u201d Qing Xin replied.</p><br/><p>Outside the door, Tang Doudou was looking around the area as she leaned against the railing of the building. From the corners of her eyes, she glanced at Qing Yin who was downstairs. How exactly should she explain it to Qing Yin?</p><br/><p>When Miss Bai came out, she was right in time to see the corners of Tang Doudou\u2019s mouth tilted up and her gaze fixed frivolously towards something below.</p><br/><p>Following that line of sight, Miss Bai only saw Qing Yin whose appearance was as lithe and graceful as a willow tree next to the river, nothing more beautiful could be imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi has waited long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou turned around and her eyes immediately lit up. Sighing with emotion, she thought, truly a great \u2018softly blooming lotus\u2019G ah.</p><br/><p>Half the hair was pulled up into coils while a large expanse of fine black hair was left to drape down from the back of her head. Wearing a pink brocade skirt, the fringes adorned with lotus leaves lightly floated with her movements and complemented her soft delicate little face. At her waist hanged a jade accessory which swayed left and right with her every movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, not long, not long. Are you done squandering time? Do you need to put on some more rouge, draw an eyebrow or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, Li gongzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s like this, then let\u2019s go find your Baili gege!\u201d Tang Doudou lifted her brow and bowed as she swept out her hand, \u201cMiss Bai, this way please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Bai nodded and leisurely walked downstairs.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou walked behind her. Watching Miss Bai\u2019s little movements with her lotus steps and the way her body appeared soft like a slender willow branch in the wind, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but start to imitate her; a small step swaying one sway, a large step swaying three sways. After imitating for a while, she got way too tired. Tang Doudou wondered if Miss Bai would also feel tired from always walking this way.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin had good martial arts skills so her hearing was keen.</p><br/><p>She had already heard the sound of the two heading down the stairs long ago, but noticing that Tang Doudou\u2019s steps were slightly strange, she curiously looked over. That scene of Tang Doudou imitating MissT/N Bai\u2019s way of walking almost made her burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>She helplessly retracted her gaze. Sometimes Li gongzi truly resembled a little girl, way too naughty.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin, let\u2019s go!\u201d Finally got down! Tang Doudou exhaled a breath. Da fudge, following behind Miss Bai made it so that she couldn\u2019t even walk naturally.</p><br/><p>She dashed like a little bird to Qing Yin, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three set off together and soon reached the so-called Wind Building they talked about. Tang Doudou looked around. This place wasn\u2019t much different from Snow Building ah!</p><br/><p>She completely couldn\u2019t understand Baili Yu\u2019s preferences.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

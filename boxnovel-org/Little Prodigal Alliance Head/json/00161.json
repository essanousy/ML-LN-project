Yu Fenger wanted to immediately run over and rescue Tang Doudou but Jin Longbiao stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFenger, something\u2019s not right. Look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger was very anxious but he still followed Jin Longbiao\u2019s gaze and looked over.</p><br/><p>Someone he saw in the crowd immediately caused his facial color to undergo a great change. \u201cIt\u2019s them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the looks of it, Tang Doudou has already returned to normal. We should return and find Bai Feiyun before discussing what to do next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger was unwilling but still nodded. \u201cThen let\u2019s hurry and go back. No matter what we can\u2019t let Xi Qiulin learn about Doudou\u2019s identity!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Longbiao nodded. \u201cDo we need to contact Old Tang and the rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the time being, let\u2019s not. They\u2019re bad news!\u201d</p><br/><p>As they spoke, they headed back to Bai Courtyard. However, they didn\u2019t find Bai Feiyun there. Thinking that he was definitely still out looking for Tang Doudou, Yu Fenger sent Wu Li out to find him.</p><br/><p>Yuner had already been in Bai Courtyard for half a month. He had bothered Tang Doudou every day about helping him save San Yu. After he was finally calmed down and convinced that the matter wasn\u2019t that urgent, he spent his days dazing out, crouched beneath the magnolia tree.</p><br/><p>However, today he actually ran over as soon as he saw Golden Wind Jade Dew walk in.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-big Brother Y-yu, B-b-beautiful Big Brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother me!\u201d Yu Fenger was in a very bad mood. Upon hearing this stuttering voice, his anger erupted.</p><br/><p>The situation was already chaotic, yet he wanted to cause more trouble!</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger rarely got angry and in the past would often patiently talk to Yuner to ease his anxiety. When he suddenly got this angry, Yuner was immediately cowed. He returned to spacing out under the magnolia tree with a wronged expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a serious fool!\u201d Yu Fenger returned to his room, feeling a headache.</p><br/><p>However, Jin Longbiao noticed that something was different about Yuner today. He walked over and patted Yuner\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYuner, were you looking for Doudou for something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Longbiao\u2019s appearance was very intimidating so Yuner shrank back a little. \u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be scared, I just look fierce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I-I wanted t-to say t-that, Beautiful Big Brother was in danger. W-wanted to h-have Big Brother Yu help\u2026\u201d stammered Yuner.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Jin Longbiao\u2019s expression immediately turned serious. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I knew w-when I saw Beautiful Big Brother yesterday,\u201d replied Yuner honestly.</p><br/><p>Jin Longbiao was stunned to hear this. \u201cYou know how to tell fortune from reading facial features?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner doesn\u2019t know what that means.\u201d After talking a little with Jin Longbiao, Yuner wasn\u2019t as scared anymore and his words became more fluid.</p><br/><p>Jin Longbiao knew that Yuner\u2019s brain didn\u2019t function very well so he didn\u2019t force him to reply. He reached out and stroked Yuner\u2019s head. \u201cWe know. Your Beautiful Big Brother has already been captured. We\u2019re currently trying to think of a way to rescue her, don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that Tang Doudou actually got captured, Yuner was stunned for a moment. Then he muttered, \u201cHow could that be? How\u2019s that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuner\u2019s voice was very soft so Jin Longbiao didn\u2019t hear it clearly. \u201cFor the time being, stay in Bai Courtyard, alright? Don\u2019t run outside, no matter what. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuner nodded. Staring at the magnolia above him, he started spacing out again.</p><br/><p>Jin Longbiao didn\u2019t feel worried that he would run around upon seeing this and went to find Yu Fenger.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou, who was completely confused, was being escorted towards the Imperial City. However, halfway there she saw a familiar figure in the crowd ahead of them and instantly returned to her senses.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

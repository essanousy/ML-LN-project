Who the hell did this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished roaring, he was hit with regret. He had known that there was going to be a lot of people coming to Cloud City yet he forgot to set up defenses in the City Lord Residence. However, wasn\u2019t this girl seriously a little too weak? The people that have entered Cloud City recently weren\u2019t anything special so how did she still end up like this?</p><br/><p>Though he felt a lot of regret, it didn\u2019t interfere with his judgement. He picked Tang Doudou up and headed straight to Cang Baicao\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>The moment Cang Baicao saw Tang Doudou\u2019s wretched appearance, his expression twisted and he noisily commented, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a kid with worse luck than you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi ignored his complaints and moved to place the person onto the bed. \u201cStop wasting time and save her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I want to scold you, but it\u2019s enough that she gets injured outside, now she\u2019s getting injured like this despite being in Cloud City? Should it be said that you, this City Lord, is too useless, or that her luck is too terrible so she ended up having a Master like you?\u201d said Cang Baicao, clicking his tongue.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yi\u2019s anger immediately erupted. \u201cOnce I find out who it was that did this, I\u2019ll kill him! Quit rubbing in salt and check on her. She\u2019s already fainted and seems severely injured!\u201d</p><br/><p>Appearance wise, the injuries caused by the dagger didn\u2019t look serious. However, this was because all the injuries were internal. \u201cShe only fainted from losing too much blood. It probably isn\u2019t a big problem. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he even finished saying the rest, his facial color suddenly changed. \u201cHow could this be!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi started to panic when he saw that Cang Baicao looked flustered. He hastily asked, \u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t block me! I need to take a careful look!\u201d There was no longer any trace of the earlier humor on Cang Baicao\u2019s face. He bent over with a serious expression to check the wound. When he saw that the flesh outside the wound was completely cut into mush, he immediately pulled out a piece of ginseng and placed it in Tang Doudou\u2019s mouth. Then he scattered some medicine over the wound to stop the blood.</p><br/><p>After he did that, he turned around and said to Su Yi who had been staring worriedly, \u201cGo call Bai Feiyun over to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words stunned Su Yi. He knew better than anyone how profound Cang Baicao\u2019s medical expertise was. In all these years, he had never heard him say that he needed someone\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao saw his confusion but didn\u2019t bother to explain and simply pushed him out. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see your disciple die, hurry and find Bai Feiyun. Have him bring his medicinal chest and prepare a lot of ginseng pieces. This will probably take a long time. You shouldn\u2019t be stingy either. Go and bring me all of the valuable medicinal ingredients in your treasury!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s face paled when he heard the seriousness in Cang Baicao\u2019s tone. He wanted to immediately go, but at the same time was too unsettled to leave without knowing the situation. \u201cOld Man, you should at least let me know the worst case scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Cang Baicao gave a cold laugh. \u201cWorst case scenario? I can\u2019t even tell how bad this is. How am I supposed to give you a worse case scenario?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no worst case? Even you can\u2019t see the limit of this? Then she, she\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop dawdling. We can still make it in time to snatch back her life, but if you delay too long, you\u2019ll have to visit the King of Hell to ask for the person!\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time he finished speaking, Su Yi\u2019s figure was already gone. Even he didn\u2019t have the ability yet to demand the King of Hell to give someone back!</p><br/><p>Only after Su Yi left, did Cang Baicao\u2019s expression become truly grave. He turned back to continue checking Tang Doudou\u2019s injury only to find that Tang Doudou had opened her eyes at some unknown time. When she saw him, she tugged her lips into an unsightly smile. \u201cOld Cang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak, it\u2019ll be troublesome if the ginseng piece falls out.\u201d Cang Baicao had her stop talking, then started to closely examine the injury again. \u201cIf it was just the injury from that dagger\u2019s barbs, it would have been manageable, but the person that tried to kill you was seriously vicious. He actually used that dagger to stir your insides\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only was Nangong Yan extremely vicious, she was also very cunning and good at acting. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she had been stabbed by her, there was no way she would have been able to link such a vicious event to someone that looked as innocent and pure as Nangong Yan.</p><br/><p>A trace of helplessness flashed through Tang Doudou\u2019s weak eyes. Cang Baicao didn\u2019t ask her who did it, nor did he start treating her. \u201cEndure for a while. Once Bai Feiyun gets here, I\u2019ll start treating you. However, your current condition is very unusual so no mistakes can be allowed during the treatment. Otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning was very clear. If anything unexpected happened during the treatment, she\u2019d have to \u2018go die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Perhaps feeling that saying these things to her were meaningless, Cang Baicao changed the topic. \u201cYour condition looks very complicated. Although I\u2019ve stopped the bleeding, to treat the injuries inside your body I must cut you open. I have to cut open your lower abdomen and sew up your injured intestines and internal organs. It\u2019s a bit complicated to talk about, and we need Hemostatic Fruits for it too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The more he spoke, the more worried he seemed to become. When he brought up the Hemostatic Fruit, he sighed. Those things weren\u2019t easy to get. That was why he had told Su Yi not to be stingy earlier. He just hoped that Su Yi had Hemostatic Fruits in his hoard of accumulated treasure.</p><br/><p>As of now, Tang Doudou was seriously alarmed. What he means was that he was going to operate on her?!</p><br/><p>Jesus ah, there were no anesthetics, equipment, or anything here. To do surgery like this, was he really serious?</p><br/><p>Hemostatic Fruit, would that thing really work?</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, well, you\u2019re going to die either way so why not let me try it out?\u201d Cang Baicao gave a dry cough. His gaze was starting to become fervent as he looked at Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Fudge, he really did want to use her as a little white mouse ah!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What are you still doing here? You didn\u2019t go eat or wash your face, it couldn\u2019t be that you really got infected by something unclean?\u201d When the other guards saw that Tang Doudou was ambling back and forth in the courtyard, someone came up and clapped her shoulder. \u201cWhat exactly is with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Infected with something unclean?</p><br/><p>A lightbulb lit up in Tang Doudou\u2019s mind. She made her gaze vacant as she looked towards that person. \u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking, why are you here?\u201d said that person.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes immediately cleared up. She looked at him for a few moments, then looked around. Suddenly, she cried, \u201cThat\u2019s not right! I was clearly heading over to go eat! Why am I still here?\u201d</p><br/><p>That person was so alarmed by her antics that his mouth twitched nervously. \u201cY-you\u2019re saying that you were walking towards the dining hall this entire time? But you\u2019re still here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s already this late, of course I\u2019d head to the dining hall to eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>That person was so frightened that his back became covered with cold sweat. He had a feeling that this guy was a little off since last night, but he never thought that this guy would encounter a ghost wall again today.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou inwardly was amused by how nervous he was, but on the surface, she made a troubled expression. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that I encountered a ghost wall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, that person immediately said, \u201cI-I-I still have things to deal with, so I\u2019ll leave first!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he ran off as if hell was on his heels.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou found it funny at first, but then she smiled wryly. In reality, relying on something like being possessed as an excuse for her actions wasn\u2019t very reliable. If she wanted to leave the city without anyone knowing, she\u2019d have to come up with some other idea.</p><br/><p>But really, why couldn\u2019t Baili Yiling have chosen a place within the city? Wasn\u2019t this clearly messing with her?</p><br/><p>What Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know at that time was that the rumor of Liu Da being possessed had already spread through the entire patrol group. Once the supervisor found out, he first berated the people for spreading nonsense, then secretly came to the living quarters to find Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Da, what exactly are you doing? Why are they all saying that you got touched by something unclean?\u201d The supervisor got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>Had he not spoken, Tang Doudou wouldn\u2019t have known that he was the supervisor. However, she immediately realized his status by his tone and she hastily replied, \u201cSupervisor, what do you mean? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe entire patrol group is talking about this, but you\u2019re saying that you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou replied helplessly, \u201cSupervisor, I really don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone since I got back! If you don\u2019t believe me, you can go ask them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fuck would I ask?\u201d replied the supervisor angrily. \u201cI think you should sit out on patrol tonight as well and reflect properly! Stop spreading rumors. If the higher ups found out about this, you can just wait to be dismissed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSupervisor!\u201d Tang Doudou hastily grabbed the supervisor to stop him from leaving. \u201cI-I really didn\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat use is there in telling me? Just stay here and don\u2019t cause anymore trouble!\u201d The supervisor rapped Tang Doudou\u2019s head in a vexed and troubled manner. \u201cYou ah, seriously! Back them, what had you promised me when your mother brought you here? But you\u2019ve already been here three years and you haven\u2019t made a single good achievement! You\u2019re always doing dumb things!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was surprised. Fudge, this Liu Da had actually gotten in through connections!</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t right, if they really did know each other, then wouldn\u2019t the supervisor be blind to not be able to spot the differences between her and the real Liu Da?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s mind whirled rapidly and came to the conclusion that there were probably other reasons.</p><br/><p>Connections had different levels. The fact that the supervisor didn\u2019t see through her disguise probably meant that this connection wasn\u2019t that strong. After Liu Da was sent here, although the supervisor promised his mother to help look after him, he didn\u2019t actually do it and left Liu Da to fend for himself.</p><br/><p>The fact that he brought up this old incident was probably because he wanted to dismiss Liu Da and was trying to come up with an excuse to!</p><br/><p>Once Tang Doudou reached this conjecture, she came up with an idea and put on an apologetic expression. \u201cSupervisor, I\u2019ve been pulling late nights every day this past period of time, so I haven\u2019t been very focused. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve caused trouble for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone has been working very hard this past period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy health has been weak since childhood. My mother sent me here so that I could become stronger and earn a bit for the family while at it\u2026 But I\u2019ve been here three years already and still haven\u2019t made any contributions. It\u2019s seriously letting down my mother\u2019s hopes and your considerate care!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know yourself rather well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Supervisor, I\u2019m begging you. I know what you mean, but my mother has so much hope in me. If I, I\u2026 If I lose this job, she\u2019ll definitely be very disappointed!\u201d cried Tang Doudou beseechingly. Inwardly, she was considering her options. This supervisor meant to take this opportunity to fire her, so should she give him the chance?</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t affect her much. Moreover, if Liu Da\u2019s family lived outside the city, she could take advantage of this chance to leave the city.</p><br/><p>However, it\u2019d be rough on the real Liu Da.</p><br/><p>As she was thinking about all of this, that supervisor said, \u201cLiu Da, about this, you know, I\u2019m not the one that makes the decisions. It\u2019s really up to the higher ups\u2026 you understand, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand!\u201d Tang Doudou quickly came up with an idea. She clenched her shirt, then asked, \u201cSupervisor, how about this? I\u2019ll use my savings from these past years as an apology. I hope you\u2019ll help speak a little on my behalf in front of the higher ups.\u201d</p><br/><p>The supervisor\u2019s expression turned stern. \u201cNonsense, what kind of person do you think of me as!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t you precisely this type of person? Who were you kidding? Tang Doudou inwardly rolled her eyes. If he wasn\u2019t here because of money, why didn\u2019t he go straight off to dismiss her and came all the way here to waste time chatting with her?</p><br/><p>\u201cSupervisor, t-that\u2019s not what I mean!\u201d Tang Doudou rubbed her hands nervously. \u201cIn my heart, you\u2019re an upright and plainspoken gentleman that\u2019s extremely fair! You\u2019re like a lofty tall mountain that can only be seen and not reached! These savings are my apology and my thanks for your care all these years. If you don\u2019t accept them, I wouldn\u2019t be able to rest easy my entire life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you put it this way, it really, it really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fits what you want too perfectly, right?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou curled her lips slightly in disdain, then continued, \u201cSir, actually, I have one additional presumptuous request!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re being so sincere, I\u2019ll listen. Say it!\u201d The supervisor was already calculating how much Liu Da could\u2019ve possibly saved in these past three years.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said, \u201cI just hope that you can keep this matter from the higher ups.\u201d</p><br/><p>The higher ups were so busy recently that they didn\u2019t even have time for breathers, why would they waste their time meddling in the matters of these small workers? The supervisor\u2019s expression was happy since his mental calculations showed that there should be quite a sum in Liu Da\u2019s savings. However, to put on a front, he sighed and said, \u201cThe only way to keep people from finding out matters is to not do them in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen supervisor, how about this? I\u2019ll take a trip home and wait until events calm down before coming back. At that time, they\u2019ll probably have forgotten about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go home?\u201d The supervisor looked at her weirdly. \u201cYour family lives outside the city. You haven\u2019t gone back to visit them even once in this past three years. If you leave right after this happens, I\u2019m afraid\u2026 it\u2019ll arouse suspicion.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

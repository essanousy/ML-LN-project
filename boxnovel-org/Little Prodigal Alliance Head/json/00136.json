Her field of vision whirled and by the time things settled again, she was already far away from that romance-filled boat and gliding through the air in a certain person\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu! What are you doing!?\u201d Tang Doudou immediately exploded when she smelled that familiar scent.</p><br/><p>When Su Yi who had been in his own world with Feng Wu heard Tang Doudou\u2019s shriek, he immediately released Feng Wu and moved to chase after them. Feng Wu pulled him to a stop, saying, \u201cThis matter is between those youngsters, as the older generation you shouldn\u2019t blindly meddle.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was before, Su Yi definitely would have already gotten angry.</p><br/><p>At this moment however, he simply gave Feng Wu a calm glance. \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Wu waved her hand. \u201cIn any case, I learned a very important matter. If you want to know, then trade for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you currently want that you don\u2019t have? And you\u2019re still setting your sights on me. It couldn\u2019t be that you\u2019re still longing for those darling treasures of mine? I\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll give them to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right ah!\u201d Feng Wu stuck out her tongue and smiled mischievously. \u201cIsn\u2019t it precisely that I\u2019m setting my sights on you, Su Yi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s temper instantly vanished. He looked at the darkening sky outside with worry and walked out. \u201cI still feel worried. I\u2019m going to follow them and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>His temper was still this annoying. Feng Wu knew that she wouldn\u2019t be able to convince him and decided not to waste her breath. She laid down on the couch and played with the hair in front of her chest as she said with a hint of resentment, \u201cThen go ah. But remember to come back soon. Otherwise, don\u2019t regret after I get tired of waiting and end up looking for someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi who had reached the entrance staggered, then turned around to shout, \u201cYou\u2019d dare!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Wu rolled her eyes at him. \u201cSee if I dare. All the people that came today are youngsters and all of them look pretty good, not to mention they\u2019re young and full of energy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, otherwise I\u2019ll go out right now and kill all of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine ah! In any case, they\u2019re not my subordinates, it\u2019s not a pity even if they die\u2026 But, do you dare to kill them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I dare!?\u201d</p><br/><p>What a joke, was there anything in this world that he, Su Yi, didn\u2019t dare to do?</p><br/><p>Feng Wu chuckled, then gave him a rebuking glance. \u201cYou ah! You\u2019re still as unbridled as before, but I precisely like this fearless part of you. How about this? Let\u2019s make a bet. If I lose, I\u2019ll go with you, but if you lose, you\u2019ll stay in Mist City. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to make a bet, wait till I get back!\u201d If he didn\u2019t start chasing after them now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! We make the bet now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it when I get back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were pretty much the peak existences within the Jianghu. During ordinary days, just a casual sentence from one of them could cause the entire martial arts community to tremble, yet they were currently acting like two peeved kids, neither willing to modestly yield.</p><br/><p>They glowered at each other for a while before Feng Wu finally smiled placidly. In the end, she was still the one that loved him a little more ah!</p><br/><p>He probably still hasn\u2019t forgotten about that woman. As of now, even if it was now about her daughter, he was still so annoyingly anxious about her.</p><br/><p>However, she (FW) had already yielded once twenty years ago, could it be that she had to yield again?</p><br/><p>Even if that person was already dead to the point that she could not be more dead.</p><br/><p>It was also laughable. How old was she now? What point was there in bickering with a dead person after so long? Forget it, forget it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s make the bet after you come back.\u201d After Feng Wu slowly said this, she collapsed onto the soft couch as if all the energy in her body had left. However, she didn\u2019t forget to exhort him, \u201cRemember to come back soon, don\u2019t make me wait another twenty years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pain and helplessness flashed through Su Yi\u2019s eyes as he looked at Feng Wu apologetically. Although their martial arts could allow people to maintain their youth, they were already over a hundred years old. If one looked closely, one could see that the corners of Feng Wu\u2019s eyes already had some wrinkles.</p><br/><p>They no longer had much time left.</p><br/><p>He walked over and gently pecked Feng Wu\u2019s face. Su Yi smiled like sunshine. \u201cWait for a bit, I\u2019ll be back right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>He has always kept his word. Feng Wu nodded in satisfaction, before closing her eyes.</p><br/><p>Su Yi didn\u2019t delay things any longer and headed straight in the direction Baili Yu had left in.</p><br/><p>Although he could tell that Baili Yu had changed a lot and was no longer that unscrupulous businessman who sought nothing but profit, how could he give Tang Doudou to Baili Yu, his long-time opponent, without worry? At the very least, he must see with his own eyes proof that Baili Yu was sincere and treated Tang Doudou well.</p><br/><p>As Su Yi chased after them without stopping to rest, Baili Yu carried Tang Doudou and flew speedily out of Mist City. During this entire time, Tang Doudou continuously cursed in rage. As she yelled, she even used her fist to beat Baili Yu\u2019s chest. However, when Baili Yu threatened to drop her if she kept hitting him, she stopped the physical violence and instead switched to more intense cursing.</p><br/><p>As long as she didn\u2019t hit him, Baili Yu simply treated her curses as wind passing by his ear and was not concerned at all.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou finally got tired of yelling at him. Her little lips pressed together dejectedly and her eyes turned misty as she said, \u201cBaili Yu, what exactly are you trying to do? Tell me straight out ah! The way things are is so confusing, it really makes me feel horrible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly,\u201d said Baili Yu softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really hate this feeling, you know?\u201d Tang Doudou buried her head in Baili Yu\u2019s broad chest. Her entire body was enveloped by that nice smelling fragrance and she felt her heart relax. It was as if as long as he hugged her like this, she would feel exceptionally safe.</p><br/><p>In the end, she has fallen in love with this man, it wasn\u2019t just a simple love. She couldn\u2019t help but cling to this feeling of safety that was as sweet as syrup.</p><br/><p>Hearing her grievance-filled voice, Baili Yu\u2019s arms tightened around her as if he wanted to never let go. \u201cI know, of course I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know yet you\u2019re still not giving an explanation?\u201d It was in vain. Tang Doudou\u2019s voice suddenly became very fierce. \u201cDid you take a fancy to some other girl? You\u2019re bored of staying with me so now you want to dump me, is that it?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was all this?</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t her little head follow the normal line of reasoning?</p><br/><p>When has there ever been another woman except her, this crossdressing tomboy, by his side all these years? He had only trained those maids for the sake of the plan. Most of the time, they were only responsible for carrying and pouring tea and had never touched him. After he got injured, it was Ye Chuan who helped him apply medicine.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, there had been so many matters to deal with lately that they could pile into a mountain. Where would he have the time to take a fancy to some other woman?</p><br/><p>He refused to carry this huge black pot!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

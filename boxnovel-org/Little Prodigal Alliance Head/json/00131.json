Stop right there!\u201d Tang Doudou hastily got up and cried for him to stop upon seeing that he was about to run off.</p><br/><p>The guard had no choice but to stay upon hearing her displeased tone.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou reached him with just a few steps. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is Xiao Dao (aka little knife). My greetings, Lady Doudou.\u201d Xiao Dao checked Tang Doudou\u2019s expression out of the corner of his eye, puzzled as to why she had called out to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Dao?\u201d Tang Doudou circled him. \u201cYou were the one following me earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao nodded honestly. \u201cMaster has commanded this subordinate to protect Lady Doudou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I know.\u201d Tang Doudou stopped walking. \u201cThen do you know where Baili Yu and the rest went?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t Master already returned?\u201d Xiao Dao was a bit confused. Master had headed back after sending him to follow Tang Doudou, so shouldn\u2019t Master already be back in the Chamber of Commerce?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did come back, but he left again. In addition, Qing He and those fellow hidden guards of yours are gone too\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou dragged him to a corner of the courtyard and asked him surreptitiously, \u201cCould it be that they\u2019ve already left Mist City?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Master said that he was going to stay in Mist City for a while, there\u2019s no way he\u2019d leave that quickly. Furthermore, if Master was going to leave, he\u2019d definitely bring Lady Doudou along.\u201d Xiao Dao shook his head like it was a rattle drum. \u201cI think Master probably rushed off to deal with some urgent matter. There\u2019s no need for Lady Doudou to worry, he\u2019ll return very soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid!\u201d Tang Doudou knocked his forehead with the back of her bent middle finger. \u201cNo matter how urgent the matter was, there\u2019s no way he would bring the tea-serving maids along as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about Qing He and the others?\u201d Xiao Dao felt wronged. He had been hit for no reason and it was so painful too! Not even Master had hit him like this before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right ah! Bringing along so many people \u2013 not only all the maids but also all your brothers as well \u2013 is he off to handle a matter or to have a fight ah?\u201d Tang Doudou gave Xiao Dao a look of disdain for being so simple-minded. No wonder she had been able to shake him off with that little trick. What exactly was Baili Yu thinking, to dispatch such a dumb guy to protect her?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a bit strange\u2026\u201d Xiao Dao finally caught on to the oddity of the situation after Tang Doudou called his attention to it. \u201cLady Doudou, please wait a moment, I\u2019ll go check if they left me any information.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past whenever they had to head out for a mission, if there was a brother that was busy with other matters and didn\u2019t go with them, they\u2019d leave a secret sign where they lived to let that brother know which way to go.</p><br/><p>The secret signs were invented by Master so the only people who could understand them were the brothers in the Chamber of Commerce.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you still waiting for, let\u2019s go!\u201d Tang Doudou hastily pulled Xiao Dao and ran towards the west side of the courtyard. She remembered Qing He had said before that all of the servants lived on this side.</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Dao pulled her to a stop. \u201cIt\u2019s not this side.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he uncomfortably struggled out of Tang Doudou\u2019s grasp and headed towards a different direction.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pondered for a while before moving to follow him.</p><br/><p>Only then did she find out that the hidden guards actually lived underground.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou followed Xiao Dao into an extremely well-concealed basement in the courtyard. Xiao Dao searched through the place several times. In the end, he turned in disappointment towards Tang Doudou and shook his head.</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, no message had been left.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think they probably encountered some extremely pressing matter and left in too much of a hurry to leave a message,\u201d concluded Xiao Dao based on his experience.</p><br/><p>Fine. Since he didn\u2019t know, there was even less hope for her to possibly know what was going on.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, that guy Baili Yu would probably be fine so there was no point thinking about it. She should just wait here for him to come back.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Where do you usually lock up the people you capture?\u201d Tang Doudou recalled that she had asked Baili Yu to bring Skinny back. She still had a lot of questions to ask Skinny. Since there was nothing else to do right now, she might as well go find Skinny and question him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao said, \u201cIt\u2019s right behind this basement. What about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake me there for a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glowered at him. \u201cWhat, it\u2019s not allowed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d Xiao Dao exposed a bashful smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m afraid Lady Doudou will be frightened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, quit wasting time and lead me there.\u201d Tang Doudou knuckle rapped his head again. As she looked at his bashful smile, she thought to herself, this Xiao Dao was actually pretty fun. Wonder if Baili Yu would agree to give him to her if she asked?</p><br/><p>As the grand Alliance Head of the martial arts circles, it was too demeaning to not even have a single attendant!</p><br/><p>Moreover, after experiencing the recent events and hearing what that old sir had said, she felt that, setting aside whether what he said was true for now, she really should build up her own power and influence. There\u2019s no way she could continue to look for people here and there to help, that would be too unreasonable.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

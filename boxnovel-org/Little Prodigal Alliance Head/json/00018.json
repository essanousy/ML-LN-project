Even though there were few that have actually seen him in action before, but some people were simply like this. Even without acting, just based on their impressive fame they would be able to intimidate the people.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Inwardly, even though there were people that felt like Li Xueyi\u2019s abilities were all just rumors, but when they saw the actual person, one by one they shut their mouths and didn\u2019t dare to speak even a word.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Not to mention, just then Li Xueyi was amongst them and heard them trash-talk him quite a bit. As long as he didn\u2019t hold a grudge it was already amituofo*, who would still dare to stick out their bird head here and try to stop him from ascending the stage.</p><br/><p>amituofo is a common prayer chant in Buddhism, in this context it\u2019s kinda like \u201cpraise the Lord\u201d or \u201cthank God\u201d/\u201dGod save me\u201d.</p><br/><p>Just like this, the high-spirited Tang Doudou stood on the stage and looked down in all directions. A feeling of heroism came forth from her heart, holy crap this must be the so-called the higher you stand the farther you can see. The scenery from a high place sure is exceptional.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Look at that good-looking young girl who has her chest wrapped. Tsk, tsk, looking down like this sure is out of the common run ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then look at Bai Feiyun, Elder Yu and the others. Humph, small fries. No matter how amazing you guys are, you still must stay under this big sis\u2019s pomegranate-dyed skirt!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Unwilling to accept, huh?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Unwilling to accept then come up and bite her ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was incomparably exhilarated inside. No wonder everyone likes to act cool, this feeling is practically like flying up to heaven!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looking at Tang Doudou who was on the stage, after the silence passed, everyone in the hall simultaneous ended up exploding into loud laughter.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Some even laughed to the point they fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Laughing to the point that Tang Doudou was completely confused. From the corners of her eyes she suddenly saw that there were some unknown objects on the stage.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After seeing it clearly, thunder immediately roared from the skies. Seriously it\u2019s like walking into a pole in daylight ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What possessed her to walk up here!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It could only be seen that below her feet was a mess. The brightly colored gaudy things were all women\u2019s garments, faint waves of young women\u2019s perfumes wafted over. Then connect that to the location they were in right now, Tang Doudou\u2019s eggshell* was almost about to shatter.</p><br/><p>Egg is another way to refer to your face because one aspect that was traditionally viewed as beautiful was if people had egg-shaped faces. As for the stage, strip show?</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi deserves to be so renowned. Today, I\u2019ve truly seen. Sure enough, he really isn\u2019t of common chord.\u201d From the crowd of laughter came Elder Yu\u2019s especially obvious mocking words.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looking down, she saw that a hint of a smile even hung around his mouth. Seeing this, the shattered eggshell Tang Doudou promptly calmed down again: \u201cThis Alliance Head is naturally not of the common chord. Otherwise why would I be Alliance Head, while you, Elder Yu, is just an Elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scenery from high heights, I\u2019m afraid Elder Yu will never be able to understand in this lifetime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Elder Yu was shocked by Tang Doudou\u2019s words to the point he choked. He had never seen such a shameless person before, for a short while he actually couldn\u2019t find any words with which to retort.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiyun at some unknown time had ended up standing next to Elder Yu. The two pressed their heads close and muttered for a while, then all that could be seen was that Elder Yu waved his hand.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>And then someone stepped out from the crowd.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Standing on the stage, Tang Doudou could see very clearly and she curled her lips in disdain. Just then Bai Feiyun had said that Elder Yu had gotten someone from Cloud Sun City to expose her wrongdoings in order to make it so she can\u2019t successfully become the Alliance Head. Looks like he\u2019s planning to use this strategy right now.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Recalling Bai Feiyun, her watery pupils flitted across him.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She saw in his knitted brows and gaze the question, why did you talk so much and provoke Elder Yu?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She just gave a cold humph and turned her face away.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>You damned silent thing. You already threw me out, and you still want me to see, hear and obey you? Which show\u2019s international joke are you pulling?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She, Tang Doudou, sure doesn\u2019t have integrity and doesn\u2019t have face, but there\u2019s no way she doesn\u2019t have self-knowledge.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun obviously wanted to use her like a chess piece. Helping her was only so that he could reach his goal, he completely didn\u2019t care about her feelings.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>From the very start she was being led by the nose by Bai Feiyun, she almost really ended up completely trusting him. Fortunately, she acted right in the nick of time. Otherwise, if she waited for Bai Feiyun to become aware that something was fishy with her, he\u2019d definitely get rid of her immediately without the slightest bit of mercy.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was already suspicious of her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

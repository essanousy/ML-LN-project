After taking that pill, she started feeling more strength in her limbs. She smiled, then started talking about how she met Baili Yu. Halfway through, Shuyin suddenly grabbed her hand and started transferring a warm energy into her body.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was surprised and was about to ask about it when she saw the look Shuyin sent her. She hastily made her expression look normal as she continued talking about Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>However, even as she spoke, she was wondering about Shuyin. The look Shuyin had sent her contained the mischievousness of a young girl. No matter how she thought about it, it didn\u2019t seem like a look that an old lady that had gone through countless years of hardships would have.</p><br/><p>\u201cShuyin!\u201d Just as she was getting confused, Lan Jia called Shuyin again.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Shuyin simultaneously looked up. Shuyin let go of her hand and fed her another pill before getting up with great difficulty. \u201cWhat is it? You\u2019ve thought it through?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you haven\u2019t lied to me,\u201d said Lan Jia coldly. \u201cOtherwise, I won\u2019t kill you, but I will make sure you suffer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you\u2019re still the same,\u201d Shuyin simply responded with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia didn\u2019t say anything else as he took out a cloth bundle from his chest and handed it to Shuyin.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou poked her head over to see what exactly it was that Lan Jia treasured so much.</p><br/><p>However, she ended up disappointed. It was actually just an enormous black cocoon.</p><br/><p>What the heck was this? And Lan Jia was actually worried that someone would steal this? Who would want something like this?</p><br/><p>Shuyin took that thing and then placed it in the cauldron.</p><br/><p>After that thing was placed inside, the golden light that was flowing over the cauldron immediately exploded in brightness and lit up both stone rooms so much it looked like it was day. The light even reached the dark passage outside.</p><br/><p>Only then did Tang Doudou see that the enormous bug that was chasing her earlier was currently lying outside in the passage. Its huge eyes were currently staring at this side fervently.</p><br/><p>F*ck! Her guess had been right! Lan Jia had purposefully guided her here!</p><br/><p>Shuyin seemed to have seen that bug as well as she laughed and said, \u201cThat\u2019s Xiao Xi, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s gotten that big?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you left, I\u2019ve kept it with me the entire time,\u201d said Lan Jia.</p><br/><p>Shuyin laughed again. \u201cOf course. You have no way to progress your martial arts, so it\u2019s much safer with Xiao Xi nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia\u2019s face darkened and he fell silent.</p><br/><p>However, after just a little while, he spoke again. \u201cWhy is it still not done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuyin replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve already waited so many years, what\u2019s a few more minutes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt much better after resting for a while and after talking with Shuyin, she felt like Shuyin was really easy to talk to, so she asked, \u201cMother, what exactly is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>She pointed at the cauldron in front of them. Curiosity was tickling her heart.</p><br/><p>Before Shuyin had the chance to reply, Lan Jia responded by glaring at her and saying, \u201cShut up and stop asking questions, otherwise, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pouted. She wanted to curse at him, but since Shuyin was here, she just humphed in disdain.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia was infuriated by her reaction and started walking over to teach her a lesson.</p><br/><p>However, Shuyin blocked his way. \u201cIt\u2019s almost done, so you had better stay over there to watch it instead of causing unnecessary complications. Otherwise, won\u2019t you end up dying from anger if you lose the thing when it was right within reach?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words clearly contained implicit meanings. Lan Jia\u2019s eyes suddenly darkened and he attacked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaint Emperor, it\u2019s me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the attack even reached its target, Shen Moru stepped out from the shadows and revealed himself. He looked at the people present, then reported respectfully, \u201cSaint Emperor, Baili Yu has gone crazy outside. He\u2019s already burned down quite a few Saint Palaces and has smashed everything in the Saint Emperor Palace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When Tang Doudou didn\u2019t react, she bent down to pinch Tang Doudou\u2019s pink cheeks and laughed sweetly. \u201cThis pleasant little appearance even makes me feel pity for you. No wonder that person couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was unknown who exactly she was talking about. All that could be seen was that after she finished speaking, she got up and commanded the guard hidden in the darkness, \u201cBring him back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou woke up, her eyes opened to a mass of pitch-black darkness. The surroundings were damp and there was a revolting smell of mold mixed with rot. She reflexively tried to cover her nose but discovered that her hands were tied behind her back and she couldn\u2019t move at all.</p><br/><p>What the f*ck!? What kind of situation is this?</p><br/><p>She looked around again but it was so dark she couldn\u2019t see anything. She exhaled and struggled a bit before she gave up. Her hands and legs were tied up very tightly and behind her was a cold rock wall. Below her feet there seemed to be something like rice straw or hay that was uncomfortably moist.</p><br/><p>From the darkness came the continuous sounds of chittering rats. From the sounds of it, it seemed like there were a lot of rats. Tang Doudou shivered as she thought about it. She once heard that when rats didn\u2019t have anything to eat, they would even eat human flesh\u2026</p><br/><p>Could it be that someone kidnapped her to feed the rats!?</p><br/><p>Wuuwuu, please don\u2019t ah. That\u2019s way too terrifying.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was scared half to death by her own thoughts. Straining her throat, she started shouting, \u201cHey, is there anyone here!? Is there anyone here ah!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice transmitted very far in the darkness and there was even a slight echo bouncing back. It seemed that this was a very spacious and empty area.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fire! Help, it\u2019s murder!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou yelled for half the day, but didn\u2019t even see a trace of a ghost. It was seriously depressing ah. And she didn\u2019t even know which moral-less bastard it was that kidnapped her and brought her to this damned place. There\u2019s no need to talk about how this place was creepy to the point birds couldn\u2019t even shit since there was not even a single bird feather lying around!</p><br/><p>Which hallowed deities were Boss Qing and the Pavilion Master she had talked about? She had only fainted after talking with Boss Qing and smelling that strange fragrance, so her current situation must be linked to those two.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even know how she provoked them. However, after coming here, she always ended up getting shot at even when lying down. Tang Doudou felt that after such a long time, she should have gotten used to it.</p><br/><p>The most depressing part was the fact that the antique lamp she finally managed to obtain ended up lost somewhere again. It\u2019s seriously fudging bad luck.</p><br/><p>Wonder if someone would come to save her? After all, she went missing in Rutaceae Pavilion. She didn\u2019t harbor any extravagant hope for Baili Yu, but Bai Feiyun would definitely come to save her. It was just a question of time\u2026</p><br/><p>However, the most troublesome matter at present was the fact that her great auntie was currently overflowing. She had only stuffed a few layers of cloth in there before she headed out and it had already been long soaked through. Right now, it felt sticky and especially uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>After thinking about random things for a while, Tang Doudou decided that she couldn\u2019t sit and wait for death, nor could she hope for someone to save her. The fact that Boss Qing dared to brazenly make her move in Rutaceae Pavilion while Baili Yu was still there, meant that the person behind her wasn\u2019t afraid of Baili Yu. This was actually her first time encountering someone that wasn\u2019t afraid of Baili Yu, so she couldn\u2019t help but be curious about this person\u2019s identity. Who could he be?</p><br/><p>\u201cUrgh, what is this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>A pained groan suddenly came from the darkness along with a familiar voice. Tang Doudou froze for a moment, then asked in surprise, \u201cLou Qingyun? Why are you here too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun was obviously also shocked to hear her voice. \u201cAlliance Head Li? Is that you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this? Wasn\u2019t I drinking wine with Lady Yun Yan? How did I end up here?\u2019 From the way Lou Qingyun was continuously sucking in cold air, his situation seemed even worse than hers. It seems he was injured.</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou could only shrug to express her lack of answers to his question. \u201cWho knows what happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the dark, Lou Qingyun could not see her movements but could still tell from her tone that she didn\u2019t know what this place was.</p><br/><p>After being silent for a long time, Lou Qingyun opened his mouth again to ask, \u201cWasn\u2019t Alliance Head Li with Baili gongzi? Where is Baili gongzi now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho freaking knows?\u201d replied Tang Doudou, annoyed. Did this guy\u2019s brain get messed up from a fall or something? If she really was with Baili Yu, how could she have been dragged to this goddamned place?</p><br/><p>After Lou Qingyun asked, he also realized that this was a dumb question and gave a couple dry coughs. Then, he changed the topic. \u201cI wonder who it was that kidnapped us? And what\u2019s their goal\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSurnamed Lou, who is that Boss Qing? Before I fainted, she said that the Pavilion Master invited me. I didn\u2019t recognize any pavilion masters so I didn\u2019t go. However, unexpectedly, before I even took a few steps, I passed out.\u201d Lou Qingyun was very familiar with Rutaceae Pavilion so perhaps he knew who the Pavilion Master was.</p><br/><p>\u201cPavilion Master?\u201d As expected, after Lou Qingyun heard this, he started mulling over it. Only after a good while did he reply with some confusion, \u201cIf it\u2019s the Pavilion Master of Rutaceae Pavilion, Alliance Head Li shouldn\u2019t be here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning within these words were worthy of being analyzed!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Boss Qing is the person in charge of Rutaceae Pavilion. The Pavilion Master she\u2019s talking about can only be himT/N.\u201d Lou Qingyun muttered as if he was talking to himself.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou then asked, \u201cYou know that person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was outside of expectations that Lou Qingyun also didn\u2019t know that person. However, he soon continued, \u201cI\u2019ve only heard of him before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly is he? Why did they bring us to this place for no reason? I haven\u2019t offended anyone lately either\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s arms hurt from the tight rope. \u201cHey, surnamed Lou, did you get injured? I heard you groan earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a knife wound. Someone slashed several cuts on my arm.\u201d Lou Qingyun\u2019s voice seemed pretty depressed. He was originally off to find a beauty but ended up being injured by someone and thrown into this creepy place. Anyone would be depressed from this.</p><br/><p>After being gloomy for a while, Lou Qingyun spoke again. \u201cHe\u2019s the master of Rutaceae Pavilion and rumor says that he\u2019s very good friends with you\u2026 But it can be seen that the rumors are mistaken!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a mistake. What dog fart of a good friend could he possibly be!? From what I see, he\u2019s more like a archenemy!\u201d When Tang Doudou heard what Lou Qingyun said, she immediately understood that this was another present from Li Xueyi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li,\u201d Lou Qingyun suddenly called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just wait patiently. Since they\u2019ve brought us here, there\u2019s no way they would keep hiding without appearing.\u201d Tang Doudou thought that Lou Qingyun was going to ask about that Pavilion Master again so she just casually comforted him while thinking about how to get rid of the rope tying her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I want to ask,\u201d said Lou Qingyun.</p><br/><p>Before Tang Doudou could reply, he went on to ask, \u201cAlliance Head Li, are you injured anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInjured?\u201d Tang Doudou shifted around a little and didn\u2019t feel anything strange anywhere on her body. \u201cI\u2019m not ah. What about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, how unlucky ah!\u201d Lou Qingyun\u2019s voice sounded a bit weak as he spoke with a helpless tone. \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s something sucking my blood. I was thinking of reminding you to be careful, but since you don\u2019t have any injuries on your body, you\u2019ll probably be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you mean is that someone purposefully injured you to make you bleed? And the thing feeding on your blood is right next to you?\u201d Tang Doudou immediately felt her hair rise up on its ends and started warily eyeing the darkness as a surge of horror attacked her. Da fudge! What kind of situation was this!?</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun nodded, but then immediately realized that it was too dark for Tang Doudou to see anything. So then, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry. This thing is only sucking blood from the open wounds. It\u2019s not interested in places that are in good condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>My meow! This is what makes it scary, alright?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was speechless in reaction to what Lou Qingyun said. The way he talked about it was as if the person whose blood was being sucked wasn\u2019t him. Thick nerves like this seriously could compete with hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Lou Qingyun, are you alright?\u201d Tang Doudou was silent for a while. When she didn\u2019t hear any reaction from Lou Qingyun\u2019s side, she immediately became panicked. It wasn\u2019t that she was worried about him but that in this sort of darkness one would feel much more relaxed with someone to talk to in order to distract themselves.</p><br/><p>If one out of the two that were talking suddenly became completely silent, the other would definitely feel alarmed and wonder if there was some danger in the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine,\u201d Lou Qingyun replied faintly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this thing sucks blood really quickly. My head feels a bit dizzy and I feel weak all over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see it clearly, but it vaguely feels like a sort of bug\u2026 And there doesn\u2019t seem to be just one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA bug? What kind of bug?\u201d Perhaps it was because he lost too much blood, Lou Qingyun\u2019s voice was incomparably weak. It came in bits and pieces. Tang Doudou could only hear something about a bug and wasn\u2019t able to hear the rest.</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun replied weakly, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Qingyun, you better not faint!\u201d God knows if he\u2019ll wake up again after he fainted!</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to faint either, but, but I seriously can\u2019t hold on anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you can\u2019t hold on anymore, you still have to hold on. You\u2019ve lost too much blood. If you faint, then it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll never be able to wake up again!\u201d Tang Doudou shouted as she shifted her body towards the side. She wanted to go over there to see exactly what was sucking Lou Qingyun\u2019s blood. From the sound of his voice, he only seemed about a meter or so away from her.</p><br/><p>As she laboriously inched forward, her hand suddenly come into contact with something.</p><br/><p>What is this? It seems to be a rock. Once she realized she had touched a rock, Tang Doudou became elated. She shifted her bound hand towards that rock, planning to use that rock to rub through the rope that was tying her up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Qingyun, you better not faint! I\u2019m heading over!\u201d Tang Doudou worked as she shouted towards Lou Qingyun. Hell, that guy better not die ah! If he died, she dared to guarantee that the next person that would be cut up to bleed would definitely be her!</p><br/><p>What exactly is that rotten Pavilion Head? To actually use human blood to feed bugs? It\u2019s seriously terrifying!</p><br/><p>Li Xueyi ah, Li Xueyi. What is with all these evil cow ghosts and snake gods around you!?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently cursed the damned ghost, Li Xueyi, for leaving so much trouble for her to bear after her death.</p><br/><p>The surroundings once again returned to the same tranquility she woke up to. Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but start worrying about Lou Qingyun. He hasn\u2019t made a sound for half the day. Could it be he really fainted and died?</p><br/><p>As she thought about it, her hand movements sped up. Just as she was grinding the rope, she happened to feel that the edge of that rock was very thin, like an unpolished blade.</p><br/><p>Her face lit up with joy. She hastily placed her center of gravity there and swept the rope back and forth as if her life depended on it. Effort does not turn its back on people with determination. Just when her hands were sore to the point she couldn\u2019t even lift them anymore, her hands were finally released. The rope had snapped!</p><br/><p>She quickly pulled off the remaining rope, then reached out to undo the rope on her feet. However, right at this moment, something cold and soft fell from the sky and onto her forehead!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They seemed to have split into several factions and each of the factions was operating individually. There were several times in which they started fighting amongst themselves in order to seize the high ground. I feel that this recent move by the Demonic Sect was definitely due to something occurring within the sect that made all of them feel a need to increase their own influence. However, I can\u2019t think of a motive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words caused Tang Doudou to have a whole new level of respect for her. As expected of a person Bai Feiyun mentioned by name, she had been able to roughly guess the entire situation having only surface information without knowing the actual situation. It was amazing. She had found the right person!</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Leader Mu truly has great insight. Everyone believed that Mu Ye wanted to contend for control over the martial arts circles, no one ever thought that it had been due to a problem within the Demonic Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demonic Sect has always been more united than the orthodox sects so it\u2019s very normal to not have thought of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how did Sect Leader Mu think of it? I\u2019m really curious!\u201d Tang Doudou stared at Mu Qingyao with bright eyes. She felt that Mu Qingyao\u2019s still gaze seemed to contain a lot of secrets.</p><br/><p>Mu Qingyao was made very uncomfortable by Tang Doudou\u2019s stare, but she couldn\u2019t very well dodge bashfully like Mu Xinyu and Mu Xinlan. She was the leader of a school, after all, so she soon calmed down. \u201cI\u2019m simply looking with my eyes and thinking with my heart, then inferring the approximate situation from what I see. However, these are simply guesses. Whether it\u2019s true or not still requires evidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she said that they were guesses, her confident tone revealed that she had faith in her inferences.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou now had thought of even more plans. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she was worried she would be mistaken to be a Dengtu Zi (famous lecher), she would have already grabbed Mu Qingyao\u2019s hand to beg her for help.</p><br/><p>After taking a moment to calm down, Tang Doudou pushed up her nose and gave a dry cough before saying, \u201cActually, the reason I came to look for Sect Leader Mu today is because I have something to request (beg).\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Qingyao seemed to be taken aback by the fact that he used the word \u2018request (beg),\u2019 as her facial color was a bit strange. However, she still said, \u201cAlliance Head Li, please go ahead and say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was unexpectedly easy to speak with.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe Sect Leader Mu also knows that the reason for my return this time is to thoroughly resolve the matter regarding the Demonic Sect.\u201d After she finished speaking, she glanced at the three Green Jade School disciples who were straining their ears to hear the conversation.</p><br/><p>Mu Qingyao instantly understood. \u201cAll of you, leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The disciples didn\u2019t dare to object knowing that these two needed to discuss an urgent matter. They quietly left with lowered heads.</p><br/><p>Mu Xinyu was the last to walk out. She glanced at Tang Doudou, rather reluctant to leave, before exiting and closing the door behind her.</p><br/><p>Mu Qingyao only retrieved her gaze when the footsteps outside became faint. She said to Tang Doudou, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded and her expression became serious as she said, \u201cI won\u2019t hide it from Sect Leader Mu, after returning today, I met with the Leader of the Demonic Sect, Mu Ye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Alliance Head Li means is that Mu Ye is currently in the city?\u201d Mu Qingyao was very shocked. What was even more shocking was that Li Xueyi had actually met with Mu Ye. Moreover, from the looks of it, no conflict had broken out between the two of them. It was very likely that they had discussed some things outsiders didn\u2019t know about. Otherwise, his expression wouldn\u2019t be like this when he brought Mu Ye up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe current situation of the Demonic Sect is just as you have described. Due to the fact that Mu Ye hasn\u2019t been in the sect lately, a dispute arose when the Protectors started fighting over power.\u201d When Tang Doudou got to this point, she examined Mu Qingyao\u2019s face. As expected, there was no surprise on Mu Qingyao\u2019s face. However, unexpectedly, there were signs of disappointment and frustration.</p><br/><p>Disappointment and frustration?</p><br/><p>Why would those expressions appear?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou stopped herself from asking and continued, \u201cI\u2019ve also negotiated with him but, regretfully, didn\u2019t succeed, so he didn\u2019t agree to retract the Demonic Sect forces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is to be expected. Although this wasn\u2019t his intention, in the end, it only brings the Demonic Sect benefits and no harm. Even I wouldn\u2019t agree to retract my forces if I were in that situation.\u201d Mu Qingyao started inferring again and even extrapolated quite well. \u201cI think that he definitely brought up a condition that Alliance Head, you, couldn\u2019t accept, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman was truly terrifyingly astute!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

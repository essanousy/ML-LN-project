With a sweet expression, she offered the fan in her hands. \u201cSenior Brother is really petty, it\u2019s just a fan but you won\u2019t even let Sister-in-Law use it! It\u2019s so hot today, how would it be possible for Sister-in-Law to catch a chill unless you use the Crystal Ice Soul Jade Fan? Sister-in-law, here you go. If Senior Brother won\u2019t let you use his, just use Yan er\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Tang Doudou was speechless. Just now, Baili Yu\u2019s words were obviously showing concern for her. How come once those words passed through Nangong Yan\u2019s mouth, they turned into Baili Yu being petty instead?</p><br/><p>When Nangong Yan saw that Tang Doudou didn\u2019t move to accept her fan, she pursed her lips. \u201cWhat? Could it be that Sister-in-Law dislikes Yan er\u2019s fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had been here for a while already. Even though there were not many people on the street, you could still see many heads poking out of the building windows on both sides. They were watching the scene with interest. It was to be expected, after all, who asked them to show their faces like that yesterday? Now everyone from Cloud City knew who these three were. As for Murong Yu, he was even more well-known.</p><br/><p>And now the four of them appeared on the street together. The spectators didn\u2019t seek to watch anything lively or exciting, since just the sight of Baili Yu and the Young City Lord was enough to be a beautiful scenery in the summertime ah!</p><br/><p>As for Murong Yu and Nangong Yan, they could only act as foil.</p><br/><p>But there were also many people who liked Nangong Yan\u2019s delicate and cute looks. It seemed as if Tang Doudou was currently making things difficult for her. The moment her face filled with grievances, people started to gossip about it.They were pretty much remarking that their Young City Lord was quite narrow-minded, as she was even competing with a young lady.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou heard these people say all sorts the things, she narrowed her eyes and prepared to say something to counterattack.</p><br/><p>But then, out of the corners of her eyes, she saw a hand take the fan from Nangong Yan\u2019s hand lightly. \u201cSince Junior Sister is being so kind, then Wife should not stand on so much ceremony and just take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was still wondering what exactly Baili Yu planned to do when she saw the familiar looking Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin appear in front of her. The ones that carried the palanquin were still the same two rows of pretty maids. When they reached them, they looked in unison towards Baili Yu and saluted, \u201cWe pay our respects to Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>They then faced Tang Doudou and saluted, \u201cWe pay our respects to Madam!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, they opened the door of the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin, then stood to either side with their hands lowered silently.</p><br/><p>The call of \u2018Madam\u2019 had annoyed the hell out of Nangong Yan. This group of hateful servants! In the past, they were still extremely respectful towards her, clearly also knowing that she was the best candidate to be Senior Brother\u2019s wife. But now they were actually addressing this lowly wretch as Madam in front of her!</p><br/><p>This lowly wretch was also truly shameless. Not only were they not married, they weren\u2019t even engaged! Yet she dared to regard herself as the Madam!</p><br/><p>This fast uniform development scared Tang Doudou quite badly. She reached out and pinched Baili Yu\u2019s waist as she leaned in close and said, \u201cStinkin\u2019 evil spirit, this is an unfair cheap trick ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her way of thinking was surprisingly identical to Nangong Yan\u2019s for once. They weren\u2019t married yet, so if she acknowledge this one word \u2018Madam\u2019, then wouldn\u2019t this allow others to say that she was poorly educated and impatient to get married?</p><br/><p>At that time, the reputations that would suffer a hit would be the reputation of the City Lord Residence and the reputation of Su Yi.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu also leaned over and whispered gently next to her ear, \u201cIt\u2019s something that will happen sooner or later. If I let others know that you are my wife a bit earlier, that will help to severe their little hopes towards Wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the spectators saw the two of them whispering to one another, many sighed sadly. It seemed that the rumors about the two already having a love affair were really true ah!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou still wanted to curse, but before she could, Baili Yu grabbed her hand and started walking to the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin. \u201cThis one\u2019s palanquin can only accommodate two people, so this one will not invite Murong gongzi to join us. This one hopes that Murong gongzi wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished saying that, he pulled Tang Doudou, who had wanted to say something but hesitated, into the palanquin. The palanquin door slowly closed. Many people extended their necks to take a good look at the unbelievably luxurious palanquin of the rumors. It appeared that the inner part of the palanquin was truly very exquisite and luxurious and the most important point was that it was very spacious!</p><br/><p>It was so large that there\u2019d be plenty of room even if four or five more people entered.</p><br/><p>Murong Yu saw that as well and the corners of his mouth twitched. Baili Yu had deliberately closed the door slowly just for him to see, huh?</p><br/><p>However, even if Baili Yu didn\u2019t say it like that, he also wouldn\u2019t have thickened his skin and shamelessly tried to sit inside. Who didn\u2019t know that up until now, the only person that had been allowed to enter the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin was Li Xueyi?</p><br/><p>This thought also occured to Nangong Yan, thus she didn\u2019t dare to act rashly and step forward. She would only humiliate herself if she got rejected.</p><br/><p>But hadn\u2019t they already agreed that they would walk there?</p><br/><p>Then why did the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin appear here?!</p><br/><p>More importantly, she had spent a lot of effort earlier to get that fan, but they took it with them into the palanquin. </p><br/><p>The Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin was warm during winter and cool during summer, there was no need for a fan at all!</p><br/><p>What was most hateful was, why would Senior Brother help that stinkin\u2019 woman bully her? Could it be that she really didn\u2019t matter at all in Senior Brother\u2019s eyes?</p><br/><p>No, that was impossible. If he didn\u2019t care for her, how come that year\u2026..</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou put down the window curtains and withdrew her gaze. Turning towards a certain someone who was lying down napping, she said with a mischievous laugh,, \u201cThis time you\u2019ve angered Nangong Yan quite badly. Look at her expression, it looks like she itches to rush and beat me to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife must be joking, I haven\u2019t angered her at all. It is merely her angering herself.\u201d Baili Yu had his eyes half-closed. His head felt somewhat heavy; it seemed that the matter of the curing the Hoarfrost Poison had to be addressed soon. </p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, that\u2019s true!\u201d After she said that, she saw the round fan that had dropped on the floor. She smirked and said, \u201cI think ah, we can still add more fuel to the fire!\u201d </p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

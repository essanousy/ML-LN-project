There was definitely some other reason involved.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe, we\u2026\u201d Yu Fenger didn\u2019t know how to start explaining. Moreover, he didn\u2019t trust Bai Feiyun. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t trust Bai Feiyun\u2019s character, but that he was worried Bai Feiyun would be so shocked by this matter that he would tell the Lord of Cloud City about it.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun wasn\u2019t the type that liked to delve into other people\u2019s private matters. When he saw that Yu Fenger was finding it hard to talk about, he didn\u2019t bring it up anymore. After deliberating a while, he said, \u201cMany people had witnessed her move to kill the person, and she was caught red-handed in the act, so it will probably be hard for her to escape this accusation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi, you have to save Doudou!\u201d Of course Yu Fenger knew about this. However, as mountain bandits, they couldn\u2019t very well step out to deal with this matter. In addition, it was very likely that those people were behind this incident, so he and Jin Longbiao could only pin all their hopes on Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun indicated for silence, then continued, \u201cThis matter isn\u2019t something that the Alliance Head Residence or White Wind Manor can really get involved with. On top of that, in regards to the Alliance Head Residence\u2019s side, Elder Yu is eager for Li Xueyi to suffer a calamity, so there\u2019s no point even hoping to get help from that side. He will definitely block all attempts from the shadows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger and Jin Longbiao shared a glance, finding this logical reasoning.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible for me to step in, but the criminal evidence is undeniable, so even if we take the rule-abiding route, Li Xueyi would still be charged with a capital offense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right. Back then I saw that corpse. Based on Doudou\u2019s tyrannical inner strength at that time, there was no way he could have made such a clean injury, much less something as brutal as snapping a person\u2019s leg straight in half. I heard that he even sent that vendor flying the moment he touched him. That is even more illogical!\u201d analyzed Yu Fenger rationally. \u201cBack then, there were several people with very profound inner strength. I don\u2019t know if this has anything to do with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He directly described those people as people with profound inner strength. This way, he could draw Bai Feiyun\u2019s attention to them, describe the situation, and get rid of the suspicions Bai Feiyun harbored towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople with profound inner strength?\u201d Bai Feiyun lowered his eyes and thought for a while. \u201cHow profound?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ordinary top-quality experts and even first-rate experts wouldn\u2019t be able to send someone flying from so far away. The only possibility was if it was a pinnacle expert. However, pinnacle experts were extremely rare. Of all the people he knew, only City Lord Su Yi and Baili Yu were pinnacle experts. As for others, he rarely heard anything about them.</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger knew those people very well. Without even thinking, he said, \u201cOne is a pinnacle expert, the others are all first-rate experts. Their inner strength and martial arts are better than mine\u2019s and Jin ge\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was surprised that Yu Fenger knew those people that well. \u201cLooks like we can only start from looking through the people that have recently entered Huai City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be too slow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of time from the start of the court session to the conviction and actual execution. If we really run out of time, we can always raid the execution grounds!\u201d Bai Feiyun already had a plan. After explaining some of it to Golden Wind Jade Dew, he left Bai Courtyard to arrange for the investigation on the people that had recently entered the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt probably won\u2019t be enough to just rely on Bai Feiyun,\u201d said Yu Fenger worriedly.</p><br/><p>Jin Longbiao felt the same as well. He suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Green Summit Stronghold and disband the group. This way, we won\u2019t have any more family burdens and will be able to participate if we need to raid the execution grounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Yu Fenger agreed with this plan. They packed up, told Wu Li to wait in Bai Courtyard for news from Bai Feiyun and to look after Yuner, then hastily left.</p><br/><p>Almost at the same time, Baili Yu, who was in the distant Mist City, found out about this incident.</p><br/><p>The jade cup in his fingers shattered into dust with a \u2018bang.\u2019 His peach blossom eyes narrowed with an irrepressible chill.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan was inwardly shocked. He had never seen Master express his anger so openly. \u201cMaster, should we tell the people in Huai City to save Lady Doudou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu restrained the chill in his eyes, then got up. Looking into the distance, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan was taken aback. \u201cBut the matters on this side haven\u2019t been settled yet. If we leave, won\u2019t all our efforts go down the drain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more important than her?\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s gaze was very dark. They actually dared to make such a brazen move. It looked like some people were unable to hold back anymore. If he didn\u2019t go back, everything pointed to disaster for Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>His mind made up, he left Mist City without bothering to inform anyone.</p><br/><p>By the time Gu Xun got the news, it had already been three days since Baili Yu left.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly does Baili Yu mean by this? He ran off, abandoning this rotten piece of business?\u201d Meng Hao angrily smashed the teacup as he complained to Gu Xun.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun didn\u2019t speak. After looking at the surface of the pond quietly for a while, he said, \u201cEven if it\u2019s a rotten piece of business, it\u2019s Baili Yu\u2019s own business. We aren\u2019t suffering any losses. At most, the opening of the shops in Five Kilometers Emporium will be postponed. It\u2019s just a bit of business, nothing worth getting angry over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut his damned attitude! He didn\u2019t even notify us! Does he really think he\u2019s all that just because he has money!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it precisely that having money was impressive?</p><br/><p>Gu Xun glanced at Meng Hao indifferently. This guy only dared to complain like this in front of him. When he was actually in front of Baili Yu, he acted as humble as a grandson.</p><br/><p>Perhaps seeing that Gu Xun didn\u2019t harbor the same anger, Meng Hao left unhappily.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

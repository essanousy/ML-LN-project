After leaping onto the roof, she immediately spotted him lying down on the roof tiles with his arms pillowing his head. The tree growing nearby cast motley shadows and from time to time, a sea breeze would blow over. He sure was enjoying himself.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou walked up and kicked his thigh.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was chewing on a stalk of cattail that he got from somewhere. He didn\u2019t react much to being kicked and just swept a glance towards Tang Doudou. \u201cYou believe what Bai Lianhua said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly an idiot would believe!\u201d Tang Doudou rolled her eyes at him, then sat down next to him.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin half-propped up his body and looked at her strangely. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe her, why bother talking with her so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should I have thrown her into the sea like you?\u201d After she said that, she scrutinized Jun Xin for a moment. \u201cJun Xin, you\u2019ll end up single if you keep treating girls this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t agree. He lay down again and the cattail he was chewing on moved up and down with his motion. He humphed heavily with disdain. \u201cBefore treating girls well, a person has to first take a look at what kind of girl they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou saw that his views on this topic wasn\u2019t going to budge, so she could only drop this topic and bring up Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably carrying out the interrogation right now!\u201d He had been outside Tang Doudou\u2019s window since dawn so he heard what Baili Yu had said to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Qing Moran?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s learned about something she shouldn\u2019t know about, so naturally\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou jolted. \u201cKilled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThough it seems like there are a lot of people that know about the Seven Great Saint Tribes, in reality, very few know about it. Then there was the fact that the person we caught this time was a Saint Envoy of the Seven Great Saint Tribes. In order to prevent future problems, Qing Moran had to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was worried that Tang Doudou would find it cruel because he supplemented, \u201cHowever, I did take into consideration how cooperative she had been and left her an intact corpse. I even sent the corpse back to Cloud Flowers House.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Tang Doudou was speechless. Could it be that this counted as a kindhearted act despite the reality that he just killed the person?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also sent Mountain\u2019s Clouds back?\u201d She was actually pretty interested in that guqin.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin lifted his head and looked at her as if she was an idiot. \u201cCan\u2019t you have some brains?\u201d</p><br/><p>She understood. Based on Baili Yu and Jun Xin\u2019s usual conduct, of course they kept something that good for themselves.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Baili Yu\u2019s enterprise had grown so big from looting and plundering.</p><br/><p>The two were silent for another while. It was seriously unbelievably boring. Even Bai Lianhua wasn\u2019t crying anymore. When Tang Doudou looked over, she saw that Bai Lianhua was sitting next to the window. She seemed to be spacing out, but also seemed to be looking at something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were the one that threw Bai Lianhua into the ocean, right?\u201d Since he had come back to kill someone last night, then it probably wouldn\u2019t have taken him much time to throw Bai Lianhua into the ocean as he headed back out.</p><br/><p>However, wasn\u2019t he worried about Bai Lianhua drowning to death?</p><br/><p>\u201cShe deserved it!\u201d said Jun Xin angrily.</p><br/><p>They stayed in Ocean City for about another week before Baili Yu gave the command to set off again.</p><br/><p>On the surface, they were still sitting in the same carriage as they headed towards Huai City with the accompanying servants and subordinates.</p><br/><p>A long procession of carriages left Ocean City and traveled very far away.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her legs, trying to rub some strength into them. She turned and looked towards the side of the steep cliff facing the water. Beneath her was the turbulent ocean. As waves struck the side of the cliff, they made roaring crashes.</p><br/><p>Hence, she had no choice but to raise her volume when she spoke. She even had to move her lips close to the person\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was trying reach Baili Yu\u2019s ear when he opened his arms and tugged her into his chest.</p><br/><p>The place Tang Doudou had been standing had still been alright, but where Baili Yu was standing there were waves right below his feet. For a moment, Tang Doudou felt herself falling through the air and she was instantly frightened to the point all color left her face. She hastily reached out and wrapped her arms around Baili Yu\u2019s neck as she said in a trembling voice, \u201cB-baili Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cL-let\u2019s go back!\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dare to even look down. Drowning had given her too much of a trauma so just the sight of the sea made her legs go weak. Baili Yu had practically half-carried her here.</p><br/><p>As of now, that procession of carriages had already gotten far away. However, when she looked over, she could still see the mysterious people following after the carriages.</p><br/><p>They were split into about three groups.</p><br/><p>One of them was definitely the Seven Great Saint Tribes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wind Cloud Island and that black-clothed man.\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s cool slender finger swept across his lip to flick off a drop of water. \u201cSo I\u2019ll have to make Wife suffer for a little as we wander the world together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d The wind and waves were too loud. She couldn\u2019t hear at all!</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled softly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to suffer some from now on. Is Wife afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glowered at him. Couldn\u2019t he speak louder!? \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu looked up. He didn\u2019t say anymore. Instead, he lifted her and jumped straight into the sea.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was scared to the point she couldn\u2019t even speak and tightly hugged Baili Yu\u2019s neck as she buried her head into his chest. Her muffled trembling voice reached Baili Yu\u2019s ears. \u201cY-you! Have you gone crazy!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Wife cursing me?\u201d Baili Yu simply smiled innocently as his figure soared like that of a crane. He stepped on the enormous rising waves and soon landed with Tang Doudou on a small boat that was swaying on the surface of the ocean.</p><br/><p>After he landed, he patted Tang Doudou\u2019s head. \u201cThis husband hasn\u2019t even become a groom yet, how could this husband die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course Tang Doudou knew that he wouldn\u2019t commit suicide, but this jump had seriously been too scary. Her heart was pounding even now. She lifted her head and looked around, then her legs went weak again.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

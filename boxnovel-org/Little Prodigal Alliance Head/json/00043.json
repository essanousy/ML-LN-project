Da fudge!</p><br/><p>What kind of deceptive encounter with a beauty was this ah!? Wouldn\u2019t you think it practically wanted to engrave her vulgar image into stone?!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her nose. Her thoughts switched instantly, and she immediately reacted. Blitzkrieg strategies were the Way of the King! If she was the one who lost control and shrieked just now, she would\u2019ve been the one who\u2019d be in trouble currently.</p><br/><p>According to the ancients\u2019 typical way of dealing with indecent assault, if this young girl ended up demanding that she take responsibility, then that seriously would\u2019ve been even more of an unlucky blow by a random steel weight!</p><br/><p>Speaking time was slow but events had actually happened fast. These thoughts had just raced through her head when Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes immediately glanced around and decisively focused on an artfully designed wooden stick in the corner.</p><br/><p>She immediately picked it up, turned and swung it towards that shrieking girl.</p><br/><p>Though who would\u2019ve expected that a strong burst of wind would ferociously attack and send her flying before the wooden stick even lowered?!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, she wasn\u2019t imagining it, she thoroughly flew up.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had a very calm expression on her face while in mid-air, but her balls hurt a lot on the inside. Alright, it\u2019s true, she\u2019d indeed encountered an expert this time!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>A loud sound abruptly rang out inside the room. Tang Doudou fell onto the ground sprawled on her back, it hurt to the point where she really wanted to curse mom. Ever since she got here, her bones were thrown around to the point that they were about to break, and her butt was also fallen on so much that it was about to become flattened chrysanthemums(in reference to the way petals bloom outwards)!</p><br/><p>She then saw the girl who had wrapped a pink dress around herself, which exposed her snow-white chest, and it was surging forth with great momentum. The girl angrily picked up the stick that had fallen to the ground along with Tang Doudou, \u201cObscene rogue! Hand over your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck! Another one wants her little life now!</p><br/><p>\u201cLady, if there\u2019s anything, let\u2019s lay down together and discuss! Ahem! Oops, I mean properly discuss!\u201d Tang Doudou climbed up with a burst of effort. She wiped the corners of her mouth and swallowed her drool before speaking: \u201cAs the proverbs say, a gentleman uses his mouth and not his fist. If there\u2019s something, can\u2019t we sit down and talk about it?\u201dT/N</p><br/><p>What a blunder ah! She didn\u2019t think that she would\u2019ve ended up alarming this young girl. Judging by the furious look on her face, it seemed like Tang Doudou wouldn\u2019t be getting away very easily this time.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently tilted her head back forty-five degrees to look at the ceiling. Dear Lord ah! How great would it have been if you could\u2019ve just sent me into some palace\u2019s or some family\u2019s power struggle ah! At least then, everyone would\u2019ve just been some normal girls without any martial arts. All she\u2019d have to do was think a little and talk big sometimes. She\u2019d be able to muddle through by being the wind that sweeps up water crests*. To throw her into the Jianghu, where swords and blades are flashing and clashing everywhere, wasn\u2019t this practically demanding her damned life?!</p><br/><p>When the wind blows past the water surface, there\u2019d be waves on the water. It describes that even though an action is infuriating (to other people), this action is still vigorous and full of life. Figuratively meaning that the matter was dealt with particularly well and the development was particularly fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cGentleman? Humph! A vile rat-like scoundrel actually dares to also claim to be a gentleman!? From what you\u2019re wearing, and that deer head rat-eyed* look of yours, you\u2019re definitely someone who\u2019s here to mount a sneak attack on Baili gege*!\u201d A trace of murderous intent streaked through the young girl\u2019s eyes. This person had to die, otherwise, Baili gege would definitely avoid her out of dislike if he finds out that she was seen by someone before!</p><br/><p>1. Deers have small and pointed heads and rats have small and round eyes. It implies that the person\u2019s face is ugly and looks crafty.</p><br/><p>2.  \u2013 \u201cgege\u201d older brother, can be used to address someone not blood-related</p><br/><p>Their relationship, which wasn\u2019t very close to begin with, might become even more distant due of this!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig girlie, this was seriously a huge misunderstanding ah! It\u2019s honestly a case of the surging waters trying to flood the Dragon King temple ah! Seriously a case of people of the same side failing to recognize their own comrades, Ah\u2019m also here to look for Baili gege ah!\u201d Tang Doudou tried explaining that it was just a beautiful misunderstanding ah!</p><br/><p>But that girl\u2019s willow brows only knit. The gaze she directed towards Tang Doudou had an extremely peculiar expression as she coldly humphed, \u201cShut up! Have you even thought about your own status? You think you\u2019re fit to call Baili gege like this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>That young girl seized up the white attired Tang Doudou again. A trace of disdain flashed through her eyes. Her gaze then stopped on Tang Doudou\u2019s delicate and pretty face.</p><br/><p>She had seen a lot of people that sought profit through family ties, but she hasn\u2019t ever seen such a shameless follower with that kind of a mentality before.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dare to shut her mouth. She wouldn\u2019t be able to clear up this situation the moment she shuts her mouth ah. So she attempted to explain once more, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, then you can go ask Qing Yin ah. I\u2019m here to look for Baili ge-Yu. I was completely unaware of the fact that you were here bathing ah! This is a huge and unjust accusation big girlie!\u201d</p><br/><p>She added a sentence in her own heart, it was seriously regretful. She had even thought it was Baili Yu that was bathing ne.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf gongzi wishes to pay a visit to my family\u2019s Baili gege, you must first present a written invitation as a notification. Someone like you that enters without being invited, how are you any different from a typical thief? Luckily, I was the one who you encountered. If it were anyone else, they would\u2019ve definitely broken both of your legs immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>I swear! How could it be this severe!?</p><br/><p>The corner of Tang Doudou\u2019s mouth quirked slightly. Even though this young girl\u2019s attitude was shifting to be slightly better, her expression still showed that she was on guard. It seemed that she had a strong distrust towards her.</p><br/><p>Please ah, little meimei! She\u2019s actually very benevolent(usually describing older people) alright? Wait no, the right phrase is \u2018very gentle\u2019!</p><br/><p>In reality, she also felt very unjustly accused ah. All she did was stay behind the screen for a while and YY a little. Great aunt wasn\u2019t able to even see a root of a feather ah, before this young girl threw on some clothes and ran out to scuffle with her.</p><br/><p>She also couldn\u2019t quite figure out the situation. She wasn\u2019t able to see the perfectly wonderful scene of a beautiful man exiting the bath and actually shook out this dust moth out of nowhere!</p><br/><p>Although, from the looks of this girl, it seemed like she was pretty easy to deal with. With just a glance, you could tell that she was a little lady not very well versed in matters of the world. Therefore, just casually confusing her a little would be good enough. After planning it out a little, Tang Doudou then said: \u201cLady\u2019s words are reasonable. Actually, it was Baili Bro that invited me here to take a brotherly bath together. I never expected it was actually switched to you. I think I must\u2019ve walked into the wrong room. Please take your time, I\u2019ll leave right away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you speaking, you prodigal Dengtu Zi(famous lecherous guy, more below in CC)!? How could my Baili gege possible know someone like you!?\u201d The young girl\u2019s face was flushed and she began angrily stomping. She glared angrily at Tang Doudou while biting her pink lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel ah\u2026Lady, this is seriously a dazzling misunderstanding. If Lady doesn\u2019t mind, then let\u2019s allow this misunderstanding to become an exquisite beginning!\u201d Tang Doudou noticed that this girl brought up \u2018Baili gege\u2019 at every breath possible. Could it be that perhaps this was a little pampered girl that Baili Yu secretly raised? Wowah! Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes lit up, she wasn\u2019t expecting to dig out such a big and special scoop. This was seriously great!</p><br/><p>She also inwardly clicked her tongue. Tsk tsk, this guy sure lives it up ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch graceful words and flowery speech(elegant but insincere), but you\u2019d best hurry up and leave. If my Baili gege found out, he definitely won\u2019t let you off!\u201d What kind of relationship did this hooligan-like man exactly have with Baili gege? This Snow Gazing Courtyard wasn\u2019t some place ordinary people could enter. She also had to borrow her relationship with Jun Xin in order to be able to freely go in and out of here, but what identity did this man have?</p><br/><p>If this girl had that sort of relationship with Baili Yu, wouldn\u2019t it be even easier to get the Alliance Head Command Tablet if she were to build a close relationship with this girl and became her good bosom friend? Afterwards, dealing with the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance would also be a cinch ah!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t the proverbs say it well? No wind can blow as well as the bedside wind ah!</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Tang Doudou approached that girl as she pulled out what she believed to be a friendly smile and cheerfully remarked: \u201cLady\u2019s skin sure is smooth and tender. It\u2019s like a freshly peeled egg, it truly makes this one envious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Words were slow, but that time passed fast. Tang Doudou\u2019s godly dragon breast-milking(Big oily hand that specializing in groping girl\u2019s breasts) hand speedily stroked her little cheek as she sighed with emotion, \u201cAh, seriously tender ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>With this, the girl couldn\u2019t stay calm anymore and suddenly screeched, \u201cAh! Shameless wanton rogue! To actually dare touch this Miss! Even Baili gege never treated me this way, you dare to actually offend me like this!? This Miss will kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>She lifted the wooden stick as she spoke, and rushed towards Tang Doudou with a burst of furious whams.</p><br/><p>Momentarily, the room was full of chickens flying and dogs jumping, it was seriously quite lively.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Bai!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yet at this time, two anxious cries came from outside the door.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s face lit up with joy. Lord ah, the rescue troops have finally arrived!</p><br/><p>As for that girl, she hurriedly threw the wooden stick away. Under Tang Doudou\u2019s dumbstruck gaze, she collapsed with a \u2018thump\u2019 onto the floor. She made a very lovely and pitiful expression, she even squeezed out two drops of tears with sheer will as she quietly choked with sobs. T/N2 She genuinely looked like a little poor darling that had been bullied. Looking at her, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but feel a growing tenderness towards her.</p><br/><p>The freak! Tang Doudou\u2019s eyeballs were practically popping out of her sockets. Which fricking drama was being dug up this time!?</p><br/><p>This development occurred barely a moment before the door was pushed open. Qing Yin ran in at the same time as Qing Xin.</p><br/><p>Glancing at the scene inside, they all silently remarked \u2018oh no\u2019.</p><br/><p>Then simultaneously hurried towards their respective masters.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Bai, are you alright!?\u201d Qing Xin ran towards the little white lotus and became extremely anxious. It must be known that she was in charge of handling this Big Miss. Today, she would have to take the biggest blame due to this incident. Right now, she only hoped that this Miss didn\u2019t suffer any harm, otherwise her offense would be immense!</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuwuuwuu, Qing Xin you finally came! Wuuwuu, I, I-I-\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Xin\u2019s forehead twitched in response. Looks like the situation wasn\u2019t good ah!</p><br/><p>While hugging the quietly sobbing Miss Bai, Qing Xin felt that calming her down was the top priority, \u201cMiss Bai, rest assured. I believe Master will definitely seek out justice for you regarding this matter! So don\u2019t be hurt. It wouldn\u2019t be good if you were to ruin your body from anger!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that this matter would be dragged to Baili Yu, Miss Bai stopped crying and leaned onto Qing Xin with great grievances, \u201cNo, how could I trouble Baili gege for such a trivial matter!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Bai, even though this was a misunderstanding, it\u2019s not a small matter at all. Moreover, I believe Alliance Head Li also isn\u2019t the type to not take responsibility\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Qing Xin\u2019s mouth opened and closed, Miss Bai started pushing off what she started, \u201cNo no, I don\u2019t want him to take responsibility. I\u2019m really fine, Qing Xin. I just beg you guys to never talk about this matter. I don\u2019t want to let Baili gege know\u2026I\u2026 wuuwuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she seemed to have suddenly recalled something and blanked for a moment. Then, looking at Tang Doudou with an extremely disbelieving expression, she stammered: \u201cY-you said he\u2019s Li Xueyi!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked back at her with a baffled expression. She saw her astonished appearance and answered, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m Li Xueyi ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>It only occurred to Qing Yin now to help her up, so she hurried over worriedly to support her, \u201cLi gongzi, are you injured somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew that Tang Doudou didn\u2019t have any martial arts right now. In contrast, Miss Bai\u2019s skill wasn\u2019t simple. With the arise of a conflict, she felt like it was much more likely for Tang Doudou to be the one to have had eaten the worst of it.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, she felt that Tang Doudou was upright and kind deep down in her heart even though she spoke flamboyantly. In addition, he also liked men. Therefore he couldn\u2019t have done anything to Miss Bai no matter what. At most he probably just saw some things he shouldn\u2019t have seen.</p><br/><p>But the most crucial point was that she also didn\u2019t like this Miss Bai.</p><br/><p>At first meeting, she actually felt that Miss Bai wasn\u2019t too bad. She was very cute and pure, a delicate and pretty little lady. But afterwards, she fell for Young Master Jun. After being teased by Young Master Jun a couple times, she shifted her affection to Master. Master didn\u2019t want to bother with her at all, yet she still nagged nonstop, causing people to extremely loathe her.</p><br/><p>Every time she came to the garden, she also thought of herself as the master.</p><br/><p>Just like this time, even though there were clearly so many guest room, she still had to come to Master\u2019s favorite Snow Building. Even though Master wasn\u2019t in the Snow Building this time, it also wasn\u2019t a place where a guest like her to come ah, much less to even take a bath in here. Isn\u2019t this evidently trying to seduce Master!?</p><br/><p>It was just that she didn\u2019t expect the person that came would be Li gongzi. If it was Master, afraid she would\u2019ve already forced Master to take responsibility!</p><br/><p>As Qing Yin angrily thought about all this, she noticed the way Miss Bai was surprised at Li gongzi\u2019s identity. Could it be that she now desired Li gongzi to take responsibility?</p><br/><p>So Qing Yin couldn\u2019t help but speak: \u201cSince Miss Bai doesn\u2019t want to let Li gongzi take responsibility, Qing Xin, you should stop exhorting too. A lady\u2019s reputation is extremely important. I also believe that Li gongzi wouldn\u2019t randomly talk about this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou heard what Qing Yin said, she seriously wanted to stick up a huge thumb for Qing Yin, then smack a kiss on her.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin ah Qing Yin, you\u2019re practically a godsend ah! I\u2019m seriously about to love you to death!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

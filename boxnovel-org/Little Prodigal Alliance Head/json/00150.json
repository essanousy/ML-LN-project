His appearance was no different from that of the reincarnation of a ghost that had starved to death.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou barely managed to keep herself from slapping him to death. Did he get hexed or something? No matter how much of a glutton he was, he still couldn\u2019t eat like this. It was so embarrassing.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin ate for a while before he noticed that no one else was moving their chopsticks. So he looked up in confusion and said, \u201cMeat ah, aiy are yall ethan?\u201d (Eat ah, why aren\u2019t you all eating?)</p><br/><p>His mouth was so full of food that he couldn\u2019t even speak clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat, y-you\u2026 how long has it been since you\u2019ve eaten?\u201d As Tang Doudou spoke, she looked towards Meng Yu. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been giving him anything to eat lately?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had only returned today, how could she possibly know how long it\u2019s been since he\u2019s eaten? Meng Yu silently criticized.</p><br/><p>She said with a grieved expression, \u201cEver since Young Master Jun ate what you cooked last time, he has never eaten Meng Yu\u2019s cooking again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tsk tsk, this is the sorrow of a foodie. After eating something good they\u2019ll never want to eat something second-best again. If he couldn\u2019t even swallow what Meng Yu made, what has he been eating these past two months? Dew? Air?</p><br/><p>At this time, Jun Xin quickly replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been out dealing with matters this past period and often didn\u2019t get to eat. Occasionally I would hunt something and roast it. The flavors were so mild that my tastebuds were about to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he buried himself in eating again.</p><br/><p>Luckily Tang Doudou had overestimated while she was cooking. After she refilled the dishes, the others slowly started eating.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was probably getting full as well, as he had slowed down his speed.</p><br/><p>After drinking a round of wine, they eased into conversation. Yu Fenger was the first to speak. He glanced at Jun Xin with restrained curiosity and asked, \u201cYoung Master Jun? Could you be the Blood Fiend Jun Xin who\u2019s ranked number one in potential in Cloud City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t speak. From the looks of it he didn\u2019t want to bother with Yu Fenger.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily glared at him and he finally lifted his eyes lazily to say: \u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon getting an affirmation, Yu Fenger covered his chest, moved. \u201cIt really is you! I never thought I\u2019d actually be able to see Blood Fiend Jun Xin while I was still alive. It\u2019s really such a surprise!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLife ah, is always full of unexpected surprises.\u201d Jun Xin sneered as he looked at Tang Doudou, then at Bai Feiyun pointedly.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know what he meant by this and nothing could be made out from Bai Feiyun\u2019s expression. Yu Fenger\u2019s eyes were filled with stars as he looked towards Jun Xin worshipfully, \u201cAs expected of Blood Fiend Jun Xin who\u2019s ranked first in potential, even a casual sentence contains deep meanings worthy of being pondered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Tang Doudou covered her forehead. Seemed like Yu Fenger\u2019s habit of not being able to close his legs when seeing a handsome guy couldn\u2019t be fixed.</p><br/><p>Jin Longbiao, on the contrary. didn\u2019t mind at all and was enjoying himself drinking with the Wu brothers.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin and Meng Yu were girls so they couldn\u2019t join in the conversation and sat there eating silently.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou saw that this atmosphere wasn\u2019t harmonious at all and rubbed her chin. Suddenly, her eyes lit up with an idea. \u201cHow about we play a game?\u201d</p><br/><p>A game?</p><br/><p>Everyone present was surprised. How could they play a game while eating?</p><br/><p>The person who cheered on the idea the most was naturally Jun Xin. Of course, he only cheered it on to wreck it.</p><br/><p>\u201cA game? What kind of fun game would a dumb person like you be able to come up with?\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re the stupid one! Tang Doudou\u2019s forehead was full of black lines. She really wanted to just beat up this damned brat, he was seriously\u2026 He really didn\u2019t give any face at all.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun put down his chopsticks and said gracefully, \u201cI\u2019ve finished eating. There\u2019s still matters to handle in the Alliance Head Residence, so I will leave first. Everyone, please take your time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he stood up, he glanced at Tang Doudou and said, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve cleaned up, come over, I still have things to speak to you about. I\u2019ve obtained news that Elder Yu has almost reached Huai City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was alarmed by this news. How could she still have the mind to play games? She stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of hesitation, Bai Feiyun nodded. \u201cThat also works.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Yu and the rest of you, take your time. Qing Yin, Meng Yu, I\u2019ll have to trouble you guys to help clean up afterwards. I\u2019ll come back after dealing with the matters!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she hastily followed after Bai Feiyun and left.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she had already left, Jun Xin put down his chopsticks as well and left without a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cFenger ah, what\u2019s with this Cloud City potential ranking? Why haven\u2019t I heard of it before? And that brat hasn\u2019t even grown an even layer of fur, is he really the Blood Fiend Jun Xin who doesn\u2019t even blink at killing someone?\u201d Although Jin Longbiao was drinking the entire time, he never shifted his attention away from Yu Fenger. The moment Jun Xin left, he moved over to ask Yu Fenger his questions.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin, Meng Yu, and Xiao Dao were still at the table. When they heard this, they shared a glance and, in tacit mutual understanding, continued eating quietly without giving Jin Longbiao an explanation.</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger smiled as he picked up his chopsticks. \u201cI never expected that Doudou would be this skilled at cooking. She\u2019s much better than the chiefs at Fragrant Cuisine House.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Longbiao instantly realized that this wasn\u2019t a good place to talk.</p><br/><p>Hence he laughed and said cooperatively, \u201cFenger, I agree with this. Doudou\u2019s culinary skills are truly great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next door, Tang Doudou rubbed her burning hot ears. Who the heck was talking about her?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

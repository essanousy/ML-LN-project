It alarmed Xi Qiuyue to the point he felt a shiver. He quickly grabbed her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you better not do anything impulsive!\u201d Xi Qiuyue advised.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In the past he also thought of looting this palanquin, but afterwards, afterwards there was no afterwards\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing that Tang Doudou didn\u2019t react, he could only ask again: \u201cDo you know whose palanquin that is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bringing this up, for better or for worse, Tang Doudou reacted. She tilted her head and asked: \u201cWhose is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Her eyes didn\u2019t move the slightest bit away from that palanquin. She was thinking, if she could just randomly break off a piece then she probably won\u2019t have to worry about eating and drinking this entire lifetime, right?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, if I tell you it\u2019ll scare the wits out of you!\u201d Xi Qiuyue glanced around before leaning close to Tang Doudou\u2019s ear to whisper: \u201cBaili Yu*.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2013 Bai(hundred) Li(inside/ancient measure of length approximately 500 meters) Yu(brilliant/glorious)</p><br/><p>Baili Yu? Which cultivation path\u2019s immortal is he?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gaped then closed her mouth. Doesn\u2019t matter which cultivation path\u2019s immortal he is, just based on this palanquin alone. Very nice, Baili Yu, you\u2019ve already succeeded in attracting this Alliance Head\u2019s attention!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The two rows of young girls that were carrying Baili Yu soon landed on the ground with incomparable grace. They slightly curtsied towards everyone in the hall and spoke simultaneously: \u201cCongratulations to Li gongzi for ascending to the Alliance Head\u2019s position!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>They came to congratulate? Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes lit up. Then, wouldn\u2019t this mean there will be gifts to receive?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>A master with this much money, the gift he gives will definitely not lack in any way!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t think being an Alliance Head could even have benefits like this!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou patted away the hand Xi Qiuyue put on her shoulder and patted off the dust on her robe. She was just about to walk up to respond when her sleeve was grabbed by someone.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go over there.\u201d A deep genial and familiar voice sounded. Tang Doudou turned around and saw Bai Feiyun had come to stand behind her at some unknown time. A helpless expression flashed past his face.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell her that it was another one of Elder Yu\u2019s conspiracies? Thinking of this, Tang Doudou looked towards Elder Yu, but unexpectedly discovered that Elder Yu seemed as if he was facing a huge enemy, his expression was completely tense.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeming to feel her gaze, Elder Yu turned his head to look over and also shook his head towards her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It\u2019s really surprisingly strange!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>How come everyone beside the one that was just talking to her looked like they just ate a dead kid?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the one that was just talking to her\u2026 She suddenly turned around and almost knocked into Xi Qiuyue. Immediately following that, she saw a face filled with dust Xi Qiuyue grin at her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The snow-white shining teeth scared her to the point she shuddered. She immediately increased the distance between her and Xi Qiuyue and went to stand with Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you running for. Just now I fainted on purpose. Otherwise, you think with your bit of strength you\u2019d actually be able to strike ben wang unconscious?\u201d Xi Qiuyue delightedly grinned.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This dear friend\u2019s interests are really\u2026 exotic!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But looking at the fact that it was he that helped her out first, then later he also helped explain to her the newcomer\u2019s identity, she\u2019ll let him off!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Once again moving over, she asked: \u201cBaili Yu is seriously rich?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world\u2019s richest man!\u201d Xi Qiuyue replied assuredly.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Since it\u2019s like this, then in the end should she go over, or not go over?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing that it\u2019s been a while yet this side still wasn\u2019t responding, that maid who was playing the flute stepped out.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to congratulate Li gongzi for ascending to the position of Alliance Head, Pavilion Master has specially prepared a gift for Li gongzi. Hope Li gongzi will kindly accept.\u201d Although she was a maid, the way she spoke was calm and neither servile nor overbearing. Just based on this attitude, even an unmarried daughter of a noble house would not be able to compete!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Adding on the faintly discernible exquisite features behind the hazy gauze veil, it was seriously of splendid and magnificent houses. As if an immortal fairy descended to the mundane world, causing people to be unable to tear their eyes away.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t even mention saying any words of rejection.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looking at the exquisite small box in her hand, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but start guessing at it. What in the world is inside that?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Night Pearls? Too common!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Diamonds? Hmm, this era doesn\u2019t have that!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Banknotes? Too straightforward, doesn\u2019t go in line with his status!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In the end, what could it be? That heart of Tang Doudou\u2019s was itching ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi?\u201d Seeing that she still hadn\u2019t moved, that woman\u2019s cherry lips delicately parted and called once again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Tang Doudou saw the blame in the beauty\u2019s eyes and her heart panicked. Without thinking she opened her mouth and replied.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The woman slowly walked over, the fragrance from her body drifted over on the wind along with her body. In a moment she had already arrived in front of Tang Doudou: \u201cMy family\u2019s Pavilion Master has said, no matter what, Li gongzi must put this away carefully! You must remember not to lose it again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she pulled Tang Doudou\u2019s hand and placed that box on it, then helped her wrap her fingers around it before leisurely walking back.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Fishy, something\u2019s fishy!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lowered her eyes and looked at the box in her hand. What did those words mean?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But before she could think much more about it, from that side the melody of the flute sounded again. The four maids lifted up the palanquin, petals fluttered without wind. From the looks of it, it seemed like they were actually about to leave.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Shoot, can\u2019t let them leave just like this!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pushed aside Bai Feiyun\u2019s hand and ran over, waving the box in her hand as she shouted: \u201cHey! Person over there, you, wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>From a look it could be seen that this guy was not on good terms with them and yet for some unfathomable reason he\u2019s gifting her a box. Now he actually wants to pat off his butt and just leave, leaving behind a pile of trouble that she\u2019ll certainly have to end up dealing with!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Doudou will never allow this kind of thing to happen!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The girl blowing the flute glanced back and asked with a smile: \u201cWhat other instructions does Li gongzi have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s brain blanked out for a moment. Seeing the box in her hand, she immediately said: \u201cYou should take this back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In the end she even added an addition sentence: \u201cThank your family\u2019s master for me! Just say that I appreciate his kind intentions, however we are still not familiar with each other. To give such a heavy gift, I really cannot accept it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The maid did not speak.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The palanquin stopped in the open space outside the hall. The petals swept up without wind seemed to also stand still. The bright white moonlight as if washing the palanquin spilled coolly onto the top of the palanquin, emitting a faint light.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaa(sigh), something that has been gifted out, how can it be taken back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Just as Tang Doudou thought that the maid suddenly went mute a languid magnetic voice drifted out along with the slightly cool night breeze.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Not waiting for her to reflect on the aftertaste of this voice, that person spoke again: \u201cIf Alliance Head Li seriously does not want it, just throw it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>His tone was exceedingly light, as if he hadn\u2019t quite woken up and it still carried a bit of haziness. It brushed people\u2019s hearts like a feather, causing people\u2019s hearts to itch, wishing they could squeeze into that palanquin to take a look and see what type of beauty was in there.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Mm, that\u2019s right. Tang Doudou was positive that the person inside the palanquin was a remarkably beautiful man!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Otherwise he must be ugly to the point of explosion, to cover up so tightly\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThrowing it away is rather too much of a pity, besides, it was so carefully prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cKnowing that it was carefully prepared, why don\u2019t you want it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s tongue flopped around in her mouth for half the day, not knowing what would be good to say.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t dare, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The last words were provoking, its meanings deep.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Tang Doudou was also very depressed. It was indeed true that she didn\u2019t dare to take this, she doesn\u2019t have that ability ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang Doudou did not say a word, Baili Yu lightly laughed: \u201cHaaa, looks like this gift cannot be sent out today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>He changed the subject: \u201cHas Alliance Head Li truly made up his mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was eager for him to take back this gift and hastily nodded: \u201cI\u2019ve thought it over, made up my mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cBen zuo feels that Alliance Head Li should take a good look at what\u2019s inside first. Making a decision after isn\u2019t too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smacked her lips, replying firmly: \u201cNo need!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look!\u201d Baili Yu persuaded.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cNot looking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you not curious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Curious ah! Practically dying of curiosity!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s complexion was odd. In regards to what was inside the box, she was comparably more curious as to what exactly this Baili Yu wanted.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Alliance Head Li is curious, why not take a look? This thing is actually fairly important to Alliance Head Li. This one* has already used quite a bit of effort in order to obtain it. After Alliance Head Li has taken a look, if you still do not want to accept it then there is no other choice but to have someone throw it away. This one cannot afford to take this item.\u201d</p><br/><p>Humble way of referring to oneself.  translates literally to \u201cbeneath this\u201d so like \u201cthis one beneath (you)\u201d.</p><br/><p>He repeated incited Tang Doudou, causing everyone to direct their gazes simultaneously towards the box in Tang Doudou\u2019s hand. What in the world is in it?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Under the clear color of the moonlight, the exquisite box and that palanquin were made of the same sort of material and in Tang Doudou\u2019s hand it almost overflowed with misty white light.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What plaything is this? To be fitted so beautifully.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin, her watery pupils slightly restrained. She clearly knew that the Baili Yu in front of her had an ulterior motive and the hidden intent was obvious. Yet she still felt perfectly willing to fall into this trap.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Curiosity killed the cat, it\u2019s probably used to talk about people like Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter I look can I refuse it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look then talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This fox is way to cunning! Although she still hasn\u2019t seen the person, from the few exchanges of dialogue Tang Doudou already had gotten to know them through experience.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Her eyes fell again onto the box. Should she look or not?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Subconsciously she looked towards Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Look!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s lips slightly opened and closed. Looking at the shape of those lips, he actually wanted her to open and look!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou became perturbed.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This Xiao Bai(pretty boy) bro, he\u2019s already scammed her several times\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Forget it, look then let\u2019s just look!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>When has she, Tang Doudou, ever been so timid? It\u2019s all because of this group of scheming prostitutes, causing her to feel as if there was an enemy soldier hidden behind each tree and bush. Causing people to analyze everything in order to not be careless and lose this small life!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Her gaze shifted to the box in her hands again. Earlier, she didn\u2019t look at it carefully. Now that she looked at it, that big sapphire on the top of the box was blindingly bright.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Putting her hand on the box, with a slight application of force she heard a faint click and the box opened.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What could be inside?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes were concentrated on Tang Doudou\u2019s hand, causing her to be under great Chinese white pear* ah!</p><br/><p>Here\u2019s a pic:</p><br/><p>This is really cute. \u201cunder great Chinese white pear\u201d is a humorous version of \u201cunder great pressure\u201d because \u201cgreat pressure\u201d and \u201cChinese white pear\u201d sounds the same.</p><br/><p>No! Tang Doudou hesitated again, her hand pressed down. What if inside was something that was disadvantageous to her and was seen by others? What will she do then?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Immediately she turned her back towards everyone and opened the box rapid as the speed of light and glanced inside.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>WTF! What toy is this!?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was very disappointed. Such a valuable box but all it contained was something like this?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Causing so many people to get involved, is this boring or what?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing the thing in the box, Tang Doudou\u2019s interests completely faded as she weakly closed the box.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li is dissatisfied?\u201d Baili Yu asked.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Of course she\u2019s not satisfied! You\u2019re so rich, how could you send such a poverty-stricken thing? Poverty-shaken is enough, but he just had to incite her to accept it after looking. Isn\u2019t this making her seem narrow-minded?</p><br/><p>B/c if she doesn\u2019t accept, it\u2019ll seem like she\u2019s looking down on the gift since it\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to be worth much.</p><br/><p>Now she has already looked at the thing, to accept it or not is a question again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Alliance Head Li?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, satisfied! How could I not be satisfied?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good if you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s voice suddenly became spirited. Tossing away the languidness it became exceptionally clear and cold: \u201cSince Alliance Head LI is satisfied with it, then put it away properly and don\u2019t lose it again! It\u2019s also not early in the day anymore, this one will not disturb everyone any longer as you discuss major events. This one will take his leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not right, not right! Tang Doudou tapped her chin. Baili Yu and that maid constantly brought up the two words \u2018don\u2019t lose\u2019, it was definitely not a coincidence!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Could it be this is something she lost?

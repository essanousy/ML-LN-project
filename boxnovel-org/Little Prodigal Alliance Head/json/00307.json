Moreover, the mountain is cool at night, so there\u2019s no need for a fan at all. If you like it, just take it. I\u2019m going to rest now so get out!\u201d She already felt uncomfortable just being alone with him so there was no way she could stand staying with him in such a small space. Whenever she smelled that brat\u2019s sticky sweet scent, she would feel uncomfortable all over.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know if that strange scent was because he ate too much sweets or what, but it just made her feel weird.</p><br/><p>Her thoughts wandered off for a while, then she noticed that Jun Xin hadn\u2019t move. She glanced up and saw that he was currently staring at her.</p><br/><p>Her face flushed, so she glowered at him and snapped, \u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s pretty cool at night in this mountain, so there\u2019s no need for a fan at all. Since that\u2019s the case, why did that waiter give you this fan?\u201d Unexpected, Jun Xin had been thinking about that matter.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s face turned even redder. Fudge, she thought he had dazed out while looking at her.</p><br/><p>That had been so narcissistic.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s worried that there\u2019s mosquitoes?\u201d Tang Doudou gave a dry cough. Then she noticed that there seemed to be something by the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMosquitoes?\u201d Jun Xin seemed quite curious about the fan and started flicking it open and close as he pondered. He sniffed, then said, \u201cThere\u2019s mosquito-repellent incense lit in this room, so there wouldn\u2019t be any mosquitoes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mosquito-repellent incense?\u201d Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t stop blushing as she faced Jun Xin. She inwardly celebrated that he didn\u2019t notice since he was thinking about something, otherwise she would have been laughed at.</p><br/><p>She then stood up and headed towards the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what mosquito-repellent incense is? It\u2019s specially made for high officials and nobles so that they can avoid being bite by things like mosquitoes during the summer. As long as this type of incense is lit, mosquitoes wouldn\u2019t approach the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou stopped and turned around. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that only the rich and influential are able to afford this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin nodded, then abruptly lifted his head. \u201cSomething\u2019s off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou noticed as well. She glanced out of the corner of her eye towards the bed and discovered that the thing was gone!</p><br/><p>She hastily ran over to Jun Xin and said, \u201cThere seems to be someone here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin shielded her as he frowned. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be anyone aware of our current whereabouts. These people probably aren\u2019t aiming for us. It was probably a coincidence that we ended up in this room where the mosquito-repellent incense is lit. The shopkeeper and the waiter probably don\u2019t know about this. Did you get a clear look at the waiter that gave you this fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou thought hard, but when she came in, she was more interested in the room so she didn\u2019t really look at that waiter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. That person had probably left because he found out that we weren\u2019t the people he was waiting for.\u201d Although Jun Xin comforted Tang Doudou this way, he didn\u2019t relax his guard in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we switch for a different inn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one inn in Dream Mountain. Those people probably didn\u2019t expect someone to book a room this late in the night.\u201d Jun Xin pulled Tang Doudou out from behind him as he tucked the fan into his waist belt. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that we\u2019re both immune to a hundred poisons, otherwise we probably would\u2019ve already fallen into this trap.\u201d</p><br/><p>He lowered his eyes and listened carefully. \u201cThose people have left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat mosquito-repellent incense contains poison?\u201d Tang Doudou sighed in relief when she heard that. Then she glanced towards the paper fan at Jun Xin\u2019s waist and the little incense stove in the room before asking this.</p><br/><p>Then she glanced at Jun Xin in confusion. \u201cWhen did you also become immune to a hundred poisons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI ate the Black Demonic Nightcrawler\u2019s heart as well.\u201d After that demonic bug grew another heart, he had gone and taken it. Although the effect wasn\u2019t as good as the first one, it was still not bad. After all, that was a very rare version of those demonic bugs. However, due to that taking too much time, he hadn\u2019t been able to return with Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou observed a moment of silence for that pitiful demonic bug.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin said, \u201cThe mosquito-repellent incense isn\u2019t poisonous, nor is the fan, but the two combined creates a poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tang Doudou nodded. \u201cSo we really don\u2019t need to change places?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t, but for the sake of being sure, let\u2019s share the same room,\u201d said Jun Xin in a serious manner. Inwardly though, he was quite happy that those strangers had given him an excuse to stay in the same room as her.</p><br/><p>If Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t saw that thing mysteriously disappear, she definitely would\u2019ve thought that Jun Xin was making all of this up for the goal of sharing a room.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine! You sleep on the floor and I\u2019ll sleep on the bed! It\u2019s decided!\u201d If they had to share a room, so be it. It wasn\u2019t like they hadn\u2019t shared one before. In addition, drastic times called for drastic measures!</p><br/><p>She\u2019ll just treat it as lending the space to a kid.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the other room instead of staying in this one,\u201d said Jun Xin quietly as he walked up to pull Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t know whether those people would come back, it\u2019d be better to stay in another room.</p><br/><p>Just as they left this room, they encountered the waiter that was carrying their food.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuests, are you two heading out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin said, \u201cThere\u2019s a strange unpleasant smell in this room. Where\u2019s the other room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange smell? Sir, please don\u2019t joke. This inn has always been quite very clean, how could there be a strange smell.\u201d As he spoke, he walked over to take a sniff.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin hastily pulled him back. Though the mosquito-repellent incense didn\u2019t have any effect on the two of them, it may have effects on an ordinary person. \u201cIf you want to check, check it yourself later. Point us towards the other room first and we can take the food ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the waiter saw that Jun Xin seemed impatient, he didn\u2019t dare to argue anymore and pointed towards the room on the opposite side of this floor. \u201cThere\u2019s only these two high quality rooms in this inn. You two really did manage to arrive coincidentally in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin and Tang Doudou shared a look. It just seemed too coincidental.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

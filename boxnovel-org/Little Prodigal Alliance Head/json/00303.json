Do you think he\u2019d be happy that you killed yourself to follow him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least I won\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s tone was firm. She glanced at Jun Xin and said, \u201cI want to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lay down with her back facing Jun Xin. However, her eyes remained wide open.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin covered her with the blanket. \u201cSleep well. Since you don\u2019t want to see Bai Feiyun, I\u2019ll find you a different doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you going through all that trouble? Jun Xin, I\u2019m going to die sooner or later. You won\u2019t be able to keep an eye on me forever. Why not just let me die now so everyone can go on with their lives comfortably?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already said that you\u2019re not allowed to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou abruptly sat up. \u201cI insist on dying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin gave a cold humph. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to you to decide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat right do you have to get involved in my decisions? Who do you think you are!?\u201d When Jun Xin refused to budge, Tang Doudou abruptly started shouting and threw everything on the bed at him. \u201cI\u2019m not even Li Xueyi, nor am I Tang Doudou! I\u2019m not the person you guys are looking for! I don\u2019t belong to this crappy place! Why won\u2019t you let me go back? Why won\u2019t you let me return!?\u201d</p><br/><p>She just didn\u2019t want to suffer the pain anymore. She would rather stay unconscious forever than to face this painful reality!</p><br/><p>That was right! She liked running away! Because, what could she do besides run away?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou!\u201d When Jun Xin saw that her emotions were going out of control again, his anger was immediately replaced by worry and he rushed over to press down her hands in order to prevent her from hurting herself. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are as long as you\u2019re you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Slap!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou slapped his face hard. \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho I am isn\u2019t important. What\u2019s important is that, he\u2019s\u2026\u201d Jun Xin repressed the pain that was spreading through his entire body as he looked at her. \u201cHe\u2019s already dead! He\u2019s dead! Even if you die, you won\u2019t be able to see him again. Don\u2019t you understand?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that once you die, everything would end?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that once you die, you won\u2019t hurt anymore?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that once you die, I won\u2019t hurt anymore? Tang Doudou, please wake up! Death doesn\u2019t solve anything! Moreover, we still haven\u2019t found Baili Yu\u2019s corpse. What if he\u2019s not dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot dead?\u201d Tang Doudou seemed to recovered some hope for a moment, but it was only for a brief moment. \u201cIf he\u2019s not dead, then why hasn\u2019t he come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Doudou, once a person dies, there\u2019s no more hope. Only the living has hope. You should know this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s alive, we must find him. If he\u2019s dead, we must see his corpse.\u201d Jun Xin reached out to pull this hateful woman into his arms as he said softly, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you to search for him. Before we find what\u2019s left of his corpse, don\u2019t mention wanting to die again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if we do find it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, if you want to die, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pushed him away. Her eyes gradually filled with spirit again. \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe in him. I\u2019m sure that he wouldn\u2019t die so easily.\u201d Jun Xin\u2019s hand paused in midair for a moment before he lowered it. \u201cYou have to believe as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lay back down on the bed as confusion flashed through her eyes. Should she believe?</p><br/><p>Back then, Lan Jia had spoken with such certainty\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sea isn\u2019t connected to the larger ocean. As long as you agree not to attempt suicide again, I\u2019ll immediately send people to search that sea!\u201d Jun Xin frowned. He got news from God Firmament Hall that Lan Jia had left Cerulean Mountain a month ago. As of now, Cerulean Mountain was a dragon without a head. The true Hall Master of God Firmament Hall, Jin Fengyi of the Gold Tribe, had already set off towards Cerulean Mountain to deal with the situation.</p><br/><p>His relationship with Jin Fengyi was not bad, so with him there, it probably wouldn\u2019t be difficult to search that sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not connected? But I saw that sea dragon outside and I saw it again in that sea. If those bodies of water aren\u2019t connected, how did that sea dragon get in and out? It couldn\u2019t be that it can actually fly like the legends say?\u201d Tang Doudou felt like Jun Xin was just lying to her in order to dissuade her from committing suicide.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to lie to you and no matter what, I\u2019ve already made you a promise. I\u2019ll bring you over so that you can see for yourself, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t find anything in the sea? What if the sea dragon already ate him?\u201d Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t bring herself to say anymore. There were too many scenarios that could take place in the large sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that the sea dragon doesn\u2019t eat dead things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd even if it had eaten him, we can just kill it and cut open its stomach to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can beat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already severely injured from fighting with Lan Jia. I heard Jin Fengyi say that when he went to take a look and tried provoking the sea dragon, it didn\u2019t even bother to surface.\u201d Jun Xin picked up the blanket, pillow, and clothes on the ground. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t worry about that anymore and just rest. I\u2019ll make the preparations, then we can head off!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about Plum Garden? Yiling\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sister-in-Law, there\u2019s me here. I won\u2019t allow Big Brother\u2019s business to fall into someone else\u2019s hands!\u201d Baili Yiling walked through the door. She had been listening outside this entire time and heard everything that Jun Xin had said. No matter how Jun Xin treated her, it had to be acknowledged that he treated this sister-in-law of hers really well.</p><br/><p>Just getting Sister-in-Law out of her comatose state probably took a great deal of effort.</p><br/><p>Although she didn\u2019t like the fact that a man other than her brother was being so nice to her sister-in-law, Jun Xin was currently the best choice of personnel to take care of her sister-in-law. If her older brother really had met an unfortunate mishap, it wouldn\u2019t be bad for Sister-in-Law to get together with Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>In any case, she didn\u2019t like Mu Ye!</p><br/><p>Then she was amused by her own heartless thoughts. She was already thinking of ways to find a man for her sister-in-law before her brother\u2019s corpse had even cooled. If her brother knew, wouldn\u2019t he crawl out from hell to throttle her?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

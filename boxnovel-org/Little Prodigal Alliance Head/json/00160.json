She was unaware of the fact that Elder Yu had already replaced all the people in the Alliance Head Residence with those loyal to him. It was just that his ability of keeping things concealed was truly amazing, even Bai Feiyun was deceived. Of course, he had used quite a lot of effort in order to accomplish this.</p><br/><p>This was all for the sake of giving Tang Doudou a fatal stab!</p><br/><p>Although he hadn\u2019t been able to block Golden Wind Jade Dew today, no one he set his sights on had ever escaped his grasp, even if they fled to the ends of the earth. Elder Yu called his trusted aide over and gave him some instructions. That person immediately revealed an admiring expression and said, \u201cElder Yu is truly supremely clever in scheming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit flattering me and go carry out the task! Also, inform Murong Ming that I\u2019m agreeing to the deal he offered last time! Have him pick a time. The meeting place is the same!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Over here, Elder Yu was thinking of ways to seize hold of information to use against Tang Doudou again. Over there, Golden Wind Jade Dew had almost caught up to Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi!\u201d They saw that there was no one in front of Bai Feiyun, and since they weren\u2019t sure whether he had been chasing Tang Doudou, Yu Fenger hastily called out to him.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun saw them and said, his usually calm face filled with anxiety, \u201cI only saw that she had ran this way. However, she was seriously too fast, I couldn\u2019t catch up. At the same time, I was worried that she would disappear from sight so I didn\u2019t turn back to find you guys. Why did it take you two so long to get here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Bai Feiyun who had always had a good temper was currently this anxious and angry, Yu Fenger hastily briefed him on what had happened earlier.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun immediately became furious. His warm gaze instantly turned cold. \u201cYu Qingshan, you\u2019re seeking death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi, let\u2019s not worry about that damned guy for now. Tell me where Doudou went? What exactly happened?\u201d asked Jin Longbiao worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer poison has flared up. She\u2019s in a delirious state and can\u2019t control her inner strength. It\u2019s very likely for her to be in life-threatening danger so we must find her and calm her enough to help her suppress her exploding inner strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of poison would be this tyrannical?\u201d asked Yu Fenger.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s gaze deepened. He glanced at Golden Wind Jade Dew\u2019s worried faces, before sighing and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that the two would definitely be shocked speechless upon hearing this, but he hadn\u2019t expected Yu Fenger to have such an abnormally strong reaction.</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger\u2019s face immediately paled and his body started trembling. His small eyes were currently opened very wide and completely bloodshot. He was clearly extremely stirred up. \u201cY-you said th-that, Doudou, she\u2019s poisoned with the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was confused about his response but he still nodded. \u201cThe matter can\u2019t be delayed, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he even finished speaking, Yu Fenger was already gone from sight.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun looked towards Jin Longbiao whose facial color was also not very good, and asked, puzzled, \u201cDo you guys know something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Longbiao sighed. \u201cThis is a long story. We had better find Doudou first!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he went to chase after Yu Fenger.</p><br/><p>The people had left and their speed was faster than his. Bai Feiyun felt that he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up to them.</p><br/><p>So he went back to the Alliance Head Residence. After making appropriate arrangements, he picked up his special medicinal box and left again.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu took in all of Bai Feiyun\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>Murong Ming was also right next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the looks of Bai Feiyun\u2019s expression, something has definitely happened to Li Xueyi!\u201d said Murong Ming.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu looked at him with disdain. \u201cI already told you earlier but you didn\u2019t believe me. You believe it now that you\u2019ve seen it with your own eyes, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, only what the eye sees is true. I, Murong Ming, never believe in rumors!\u201d</p><br/><p>Joy appeared on Murong Ming\u2019s usually gloomy face. \u201cMany thanks to Elder Yu for telling me such important information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy information isn\u2019t free, a remuneration is required. Murong gongzi, I believe you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope Murong gongzi will send over the item soon so that this Yu could give you more useful information!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Elder Yu, I\u2019ll send my younger sister over as soon as I get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the \u2018item\u2019 Elder Yu was talking about was Murong Ming\u2019s sister, Murong Jiao. The two discussed a person like an object without a change in expression as if it was as normal as breathing. They were truly inhumane!</p><br/><p>Even their loyal subordinates couldn\u2019t help but silently remark that the Murong family\u2019s Miss was truly pitiful.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Yu Fenger was anxiously searching for Tang Doudou. Few people in the world could compete with him in qinggong, yet after flying a great distance he still didn\u2019t see any trace of Tang Doudou. He couldn\u2019t help but panic even more. Could it be that Bai Feiyun had pointed in the wrong direction?</p><br/><p>He looked around again. He even seized several people to ask them if they saw anyone passing by, but they all said no.</p><br/><p>Later, Jin Longbiao caught up with him right in time to see Yu Fenger kick over a vendor\u2019s stall and move to kill someone. He hastily went up and stopped Yu Fenger.</p><br/><p>\u201cFenger ah, even if you\u2019re anxious you can\u2019t kill people!\u201d Jin Longbiao pulled Yu Fenger to a stop and said tenderly, \u201cDon\u2019t be so impatient for now, alright? Let\u2019s search slowly. I believe that heaven helps the worthy, so Tang Doudou will definitely be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJin ge!\u201d After Yu Fenger saw Jin Longbiao, his tears started flowing nonstop. \u201cI just feel really uneasy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The passersby were looking at them with weird gazes, but Jin Longbiao ignored them and pulled Yu Fenger into his arms. \u201cI know, I know about it all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger\u2019s tears fell even more heavily when Jin Longbiao started comforting him. He sobbed, \u201cJin ge, I felt really close to Doudou since our first meeting, but I never thought that she was actually, actually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

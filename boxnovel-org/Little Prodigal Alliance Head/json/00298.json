Tang Doudou\u2019s brows furrowed from pain, but her eyes remained dull.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head?\u201d Only then did Bai Feiyun realize that something was wrong. He had lied to Jun Xin earlier, he had already undid the seal. It was just that he needed to ask Tang Doudou something, that\u2019s why he lied to get Jun Xin away.</p><br/><p>However, although Tang Doudou had opened her eyes, she was still unconscious. The way she looked was as if she had lost her soul.</p><br/><p>Lost her soul?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s expression turned serious. He tapped a few more of her pressure points, then collected the needles and left the room.</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin saw him come out, he hastily ran over. \u201cIs she awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun shook his head. Jun Xin\u2019s heart started pounding anxiously when he saw the grave expression on Bai Feiyun\u2019s face. \u201cShe\u2019s not awake? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve undone her seal and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with her body, it seems like she\u2019s the one who\u2019s unwilling to wake up.\u201d As he spoke, he glanced at Jun Xin. \u201cYoung Master Jun, has the Alliance Head encountered something traumatizing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jun Xin had a bad premonition that was getting stronger. \u201cBut someone else does!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, he ran off.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun had no choice but to return to the room. He looked Tang Doudou over again. Her body was fine, it was clearly a mental problem. Although her body was alert, she was still unconscious.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin soon returned with a cursing lady in tow.</p><br/><p>It was Baili Yiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned brat! Let go of me! I\u2019ll bite you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Jun Xin\u2019s expression was completely dark. He was extremely worried and vexed since Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t waking up. If it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that Baili Yiling was the only one who knew what happened to her, he would have already killed this annoying and noisy woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jun, this is?\u201d Bai Feiyun looked at Baili Yiling who was still dressed in ragged clothing. However, when he saw her eyes, he had an inkling of who she was.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yiling, Baili Yu\u2019s younger sister!\u201d Jun Xin gave a simple explanation, then pulled Baili Yiling to Tang Doudou\u2019s bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up already and take a look for yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling flung off Jun Xin\u2019s hand and turned to glance at Tang Doudou. When she saw Tang Doudou\u2019s lifeless eyes, she cried out in shock, \u201cSister-in-Law! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she saw Bai Feiyun who was standing by the bed.</p><br/><p>When she saw that he was dressed in white with handsome and gentle features, she asked, \u201cYou\u2019re Bai Feiyun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCity Lord Su told me that you would be able to wake Sister-in-Law up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already done all I can, it\u2019s the Alliance Head that\u2019s not willing to wake up,\u201d said Bai Feiyun as he looked towards Baili Yiling. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to find out what exactly Alliance Head had encountered, to cause her to be unwilling to wake up. The reason must be found before we can start coming up with ideas to convince her to wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jun is simply too worried about Alliance Head, that\u2019s why he was a little rough with you. I hope Lady won\u2019t blame him too much and will tell us about what happened to you and Alliance Head during this past period.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling glanced at Jun Xin. She had known that something was wrong with Sister-in-Law when she saw how impatient he was, but she hadn\u2019t expected it to be so severe.</p><br/><p>Of course she knew why Sister-in-Law wasn\u2019t willing to wake up.</p><br/><p>It was definitely that Brother\u2019s death caused her to lose the will to live. Since she had no will to live, she naturally wouldn\u2019t wake up.</p><br/><p>A person as gentle and considerate as Bai Feiyun was much more pleasing to the eye than Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of things had happened. I think Sister-in-Law isn\u2019t willing to wake up because Big Brother\u2019s death had dealt her too large of a blow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStinkin\u2019 girl! What nonsense are you saying!\u201d Before she could even finish her sentence, Jun Xin started shouting.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

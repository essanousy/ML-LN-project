However, appearing here wasn\u2019t very normal.</p><br/><p>It truly wasn\u2019t normal!</p><br/><p>Extremely abnormal!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou suddenly came to a realization. First, it was Mu Ye, now it was Baili Yu. The people that shouldn\u2019t have appeared have all appeared here. If this was still normal, then she, Tang Doudou must be the abnormal one.</p><br/><p>Aside from the fact that this place was really far away from the Gathering, it was a place where servants lived. The ancient times weren\u2019t the modern times. Masters and servants were differentiated and usually, Masters would never go to the places the servants lived.</p><br/><p>The kitchen was even more unlikely. Wasn\u2019t there a proverb that said \u2018a nobleman stays clear of the kitchen\u2019? The meaning was probably close to this.</p><br/><p>The actual Mencius meaning is that a nobleman who has seen a living animal cannot bear to see it die, hence he keeps away from the kitchen</p><br/><p>Mu Ye had come here to find her, and because of that, he had even hung out in front of the latrine.</p><br/><p>But what was Baili Yu here for? From the looks of it, could he also have come here to find her? Then she sent this thought playing with a slap and a whoosh. When he wanted to see her, he would usually send servants over to call her. How could he possibly have lowered himself to run over personally?</p><br/><p>From what Tang Doudou remembered, Baili Yu would make an extremely pompous appearance every time he went out. He would bring along a pile of maids that were as gorgeous as flowers with blossom petals fluttering around like \u2018hualala\u2019. He seemed to rarely go around alone.</p><br/><p>To come alone over here like this, could it be that he made a date with a lady?</p><br/><p>Or was it that he made a date with Jun Xin?</p><br/><p>As she rubbed her chin, Tang Doudou felt that the latter possibility was more likely. When she heard Meng Yu talk about the Plum Garden Gathering and learned that most of the people that were participating were young masters and misses, the intention became very obvious. It\u2019s simply a large scale blind date party!</p><br/><p>The people of ancient times all liked participating in such events. After all, in ancient times, young ladies weren\u2019t allowed to casually leave the house and randomly wander around. If they wanted to meet a boyfriend, other than through their parents or matchmakers, the only chance they had to make their own choice was at festivals and banquets. And this Plum Garden Gathering was extremely similar to those kind of events.</p><br/><p>A blind date party, huh. Actually, a lot of the young masters and misses probably already knew each other. Other than all sorts of blind matches, there were likely many dates here today as well.</p><br/><p>This plum sea was so large, and it was all deep forest. It\u2019d be easy to find a place with no one around and do some things that are not suitable for children\u2026</p><br/><p>Tsk tsk. As Tang Doudou thought about it, a vulgar smiling expression appeared in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Seeing her smile with hints of evil design, Baili Yu, who seemed a little intoxicated, bent over. His eyes slightly lowered. Below his long eyelashes, an expanse gradually formed into a delicately carved nose bridge. He looked at Tang Doudou whose cheeks were smudged with black ash and got a strong impression that he seemed like a kitten. He couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as he reached out and lightly brushed past Tang Doudou\u2019s nosetip. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was in a daze, so how could she have expected that he would suddenly reach out? And the place he touched was her nose tip as well. The familiar feeling immediately made her snap back to her senses. She recalled the torture her nose went through last time and immediately jumped backwards as she stared at Baili Yu with her clear black pupils. \u2018What are you doing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu retrieved his hand as he creased his brows slightly. \u201cHelping you wipe it clean. It\u2019s so dirty, too ugly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Is he really ok?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lightly rubbed her forehead, feeling that Baili Yu\u2019s attitude right now was far far from anything good. He seemed like a completely different person from when he was somber.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019ll just do it myself!\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know what he was talking about wiping, but she didn\u2019t dare to let Baili Yu get too close, so she lifted her hand and randomly wiped around on her nose. In the end, the black ash wasn\u2019t wiped off and even more was rubbed onto her face.</p><br/><p>She had completely become a multicolored cat now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it still there?\u201d Tang Doudou asked.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu nodded.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed some more, having roughly guessed that the thing on her face was probably the ashes from when she was cooking earlier. Those things weren\u2019t easy to wipe off, so she gave a few more fierce swipes. When she felt that it was probably gone, she asked again, \u201cThis time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she even finished speaking, a large shadow fell over her. Baili Yu had once again approached and was leaning over to look at her. His good-looking brows lifted. \u201cThis is ash. You cooked again? What did you make?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the spicy strips last time made him really angry, he still couldn\u2019t not admit that the taste was extremely good. It was to the point that it caused him to desire more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t started cooking yet.\u201d Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. She didn\u2019t plan to tell him about how she helped Meng Yu cook yet.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu said, \u2018Oh.\u2019 He then asked, \u201cWhat are you planning to make?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pointed at the river next to her. \u201cNuo, fish.\u201dE/N</p><br/><p>Hehe, she\u2019s afraid to go down to catch the fish, but Baili Yu\u2019s not scared ah. Tang Doudou laughed like a little fox as she peeked at his seemingly interested expression.</p><br/><p>When he had just arrived, he saw Tang Doudou stare at that river and grumbled to himself nonstop. Looks like he really had been wanting to fish.</p><br/><p>But, he seemed to remember that Li Xueyi didn\u2019t know how to swim?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu lightly pushed Tang Doudou who was in front of him aside and walked to the river. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? Tang Doudou paused dumbstruck. She hadn\u2019t even asked yet? Could it be that she\u2019s having another auditory hallucination?</p><br/><p>Seeing that she didn\u2019t reply even after a while, Baili Yu asked again, \u201cHow many do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026it wasn\u2019t an auditory hallucination ah. He really was asking her!</p><br/><p>Meow ah. The sun still hasn\u2019t risen from the east ah. Baili Yu was actually being this thoughtful, it was surely a world-shocking strange event.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because she was silent too long, or perhaps Baili Yu was in a really good mood today, or perhaps today\u2019s weather was too good\u2026</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou slowly returned to her senses, she noticed that there were around four fishes that had been strung together with grass in front of her. A languid voice drifted over. \u201cAre these enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she lifted her eyes, she meet with Baili Yu\u2019s deep whirlpool-like pupils that seemed to have a mysterious attracting force. It felt like her entire being was about to be suck into those pupils. She seemed to have seen such pupils somewhere before. It seemed like last time, when she fell into the water, the person that flew over also had these kinds of pupils\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not right, even before that, she had seen them somewhere. Where did she see them before?</p><br/><p>Where was it? How come she can\u2019t remember!?</p><br/><p>A stab of pain pulsed from deep inside her head. The lacerating feeling forced Tang Doudou to stop thinking and slowly crouch down.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu saw that something was wrong with her and threw the fish to the side. He reached out to help hold Tang Doudou up as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is the poison flaring up again? That\u2019s not possible, I\u2019ve already helped you suppress it earlier. There\u2019s no way it would flare up again so soon. Sit down and let me take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, my head feels like it\u2019s about to split. It hurts.\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t really hear what Baili Yu said as she held her head with her hands.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu lifted his hand to check her pulse but didn\u2019t find anything out of the ordinary. He couldn\u2019t help but become puzzled as well. Why would it be like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you back to Plum Garden.\u201d Baili Yu made a swift decision. After he returned, it\u2019d be best if he also called Bai Feiyun over to take a look.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no need. I\u2019ll be fine after I rest a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to be stubborn. Even though it\u2019s said that I\u2019m the only one capable of curing the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, I\u2019m still not very knowledgeable about its characteristics. No one knows what kind of side effects it can create. If you want to live, you must listen to me.\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s eyes were filled with never before seen seriousness. He had already decided that if Tang Doudou wouldn\u2019t agree, he would just forcefully carry him back.</p><br/><p>He had promised that person that he would help cure Tang Doudou\u2019s Disseminating Tassel Fragrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you treat me so well?\u201d The headache had slowly dispersed and as Tang Doudou\u2019s attention returned, she noticed the strong worry in Baili Yu\u2019s eyes. Because of that, this sentence just abruptly popped out.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was stunned for a moment, then smiled. \u201cDid Alliance Head Li forget the deal between us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Deal?</p><br/><p>She looked towards Baili Yu with confusion. \u201cWhat deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, you\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d Baili Yu smiled lightly as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that I can\u2019t remember anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, if you can\u2019t remember, then just let it be. From the looks of it, you seem to feel a lot better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. The pain had come quickly, but also left quickly. She sat on the ground and dazed for a while as she recalled what Baili Yu said earlier. So he was treating her this well due to that deal. From that time when he helped her out of her difficult position at that time in the martial arts convention, to the time he saved her from the pond, and when he went to the Alliance Head Residence to catch her\u2026 all of it was because of that deal!</p><br/><p>After sitting up, she saw the fishes on the ground and immediately jumped up, lively and cheerful again. \u201cLet\u2019s go! Seeing as you\u2019ve saved me several times, I\u2019ll let you eat some cooked fish!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d Baili Yu saw the bewilderness in her eyes that had transformed into disappointment. Yet an instant later, it was replaced by liveliness again. He couldn\u2019t help but also smile slightly as he said, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they got back to the wood house, all the people inside hurriedly dropped to a kneel the moment they saw Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Yu lifted her eyes and saw Tang Doudou was standing next to Baili Yu. A bad premonition emerged in her heart. Could it be that Master discovered that she had Alliance Head Li help out and came to penalize her?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not right ah. Even if he was going to punish her, he would have sent someone to call her over. How could it be possible for him to come over personally?</p><br/><p>Then, she looked again on the suspicious red on Baili Yu\u2019s jade-like face and couldn\u2019t stop herself from muttering: Master drank wine?</p><br/><p>Immediately, she became even more on her guard. Master drank ah!</p><br/><p>The last time he drank was already eight years ago, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>That time, it seemed to have been because\u2026</p><br/><p>Before she could think too much, Tang Doudou pointed to the side and said to Baili Yu, \u201cYou can just wait over there. I\u2019ll call you once I finish!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbstruck. She was speaking to Master like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Out of everyone\u2019s expectations, Baili Yu gave a light reply and really went over there to wait.</p><br/><p>Probably because the alcohol was rushing to his head, he slightly lowered his eyes and collapsed onto the emptied long table. After giving a yawn, he actually just laid down there and fell asleep. In regards to this, even Tang Doudou was also speechless. This person\u2019s ignoring ability truly has reached the point of perfection where the stove fire has turned bright green. (allusion to Daoist alchemy)</p><br/><p>Looking at the people kneeling on the floor, she said, \u201cYou guys should get up, stop kneeling. Meng Yu, have you finished everything? Can I borrow the kitchen?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she shook the fish in front of her a little. There\u2019s so many fish, what should she make?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li, why did Master come here?\u201d Meng Yu saw that Baili Yu seemed to have fallen into deep sleep and immediately stood up and waved towards the other women, signaling for them to get out. Afterwards, she rushed to Tang Doudou and asked quietly.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou waved, \u201cHow would I know? This is his garden so wherever he wants to go is up to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>That sentence was rather true.</p><br/><p>Meng Yu asked again, \u201cThen what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>She pointed at the fishes in Tang Doudou\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you planning to cook fish for Master? Master didn\u2019t eat over there earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know ah. I was planning on cooking some fish from the start, so I went to the river to get some fish. However, I ended up encountering him, so we just came back together.\u201d Tang Doudou casually replied. Seeing that it was already past lunch, she decided to rest awhile and just make it for dinner.</p><br/><p>So Tang Doudou put the fishes in her hand into the wooden basin nearby and asked Meng Yu, \u201cDidn\u2019t you need to head to the cooking competition? If you don\u2019t head over now, won\u2019t you end up late?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah!\u201d When she was reminded by Tang Doudou like this, Meng Yu immediately recalled her proper business. \u201cThen I\u2019ll head over first. Master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t lose your master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Yu looked at Baili Yu who was breathing evenly and realized that Ye Chuan was definitely following Master secretly, hence she stopped worrying.</p><br/><p>After calling someone to help carry all the things for the competition over, she left as well.</p><br/><p>All that was left in the spacious wooden house was Tang Doudou who was cleaning up the stove and Baili Yu who was sound asleep.</p><br/><p>Wind blew in. Tang Doudou rubbed her chilled neck. Why did the temperature drop so suddenly?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He sighed and said, \u201cDoes Alliance Head know who your birth parents are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe City Lord is likely trying to revive your mother, Jun Yuner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Yuner?\u201d Tang Doudou reflexively glanced towards Jun Xin. However, she then recalled that Jun Xin only got his name after he got to Wind Cloud Island and that his original surname was Ming, so they probably didn\u2019t have any relationship.</p><br/><p>However, after finding out about Lan Jia\u2019s complicated relationships, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder\u2026</p><br/><p>She gave a soft cough, then rubbed her chin as she asked, \u201cWho\u2019s Jun Yuner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your birth mother and the disciple of the City Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfff!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was too much information! Tang Doudou covered her forehead. Her mother was Su Yi\u2019s disciple, and she was also Su Yi\u2019s disciple. Wasn\u2019t this a little too messy!?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you know who my father is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe City Lord never told me about him. All I know is that after your mother gave birth to you, you were swapped by someone and became Tang Doudou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Tang family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>So Li Xueyi\u2019s background was also that complicated. Tang Doudou then asked, \u201cWhat does this have to do with you needing the Alliance Head Command Tablet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one that wants the Alliance Head Command Tablet, it\u2019s the City Lord that wants it,\u201d said Bai Feiyun mildly. \u201cIf I wanted the Alliance Head Command Tablet, I would\u2019ve already taken it instead of waiting until now. In addition, I have no interest in your position.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded before asking, \u201cThen what does Su Yi want the tablet for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCity Lord would only make a few remarks about his matters and matters involving you occasionally when he was in a good mood. Other times, he never talks about it and I don\u2019t dare to ask about them either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning was that he didn\u2019t know why Su Yi wanted the Alliance Head Command Tablet either.</p><br/><p>However, Su Yi was the one who gave her the tablet in the first place? Although it later fell into Baili Yu\u2019s hands for a while, Su Yi didn\u2019t seem to care about it, so why did he want it back now?</p><br/><p>Something felt strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve finished asking your questions, Alliance Head, could you let me go?\u201d prompted Bai Feiyun gently when he saw that she was sinking into thought.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou scratched her head. It felt a little anticlimactic to just let him go now. But if she didn\u2019t let him go, what would she keep him for?</p><br/><p>Just as she was trying to think of another question, Jun Xin walked in with a yawn. \u201cBai gongzi, I apologize for my earlier actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he said, \u201cBut the fact that you guys want the Alliance Head Command Tablet probably isn\u2019t for something as simple as just wanting to revive Jun Yuner, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThough this dumb woman doesn\u2019t know the secrets the Alliance Head Command Tablet contains, there\u2019s no way you don\u2019t know, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s no way Su Yi wouldn\u2019t know since he was the one that made the tablet. It was Baili Shuyin who later took the tablet and split it into two parts. The part that Cloud City held onto became a symbol of the Alliance Head\u2019s status. Meanwhile, the one in Baili Yu\u2019s possession expressed his influence as the richest individual in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Alliance Head Command Tablet\u2019 you\u2019re trying to get back, is it only Cloud City\u2019s part or both pieces? Su Yi is probably already aware that this stinkin\u2019 woman now possesses both of them, right? That\u2019s why he\u2019s asking her for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words caused Bai Feiyun\u2019s facial color to change drastically. \u201cYoung Master Jun, it\u2019s best not to speak without evidence. Your empty conjectures may harm the City Lord\u2019s reputation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does his reputation have to do with me? I\u2019m just warning you guys. Although Su Yi does treat this stinkin\u2019 woman well, if he harbors any other intentions, he shouldn\u2019t blame me for heartlessly turning against him and digging out all those old matters. At that point, I\u2019d like to see how he can survive the shame.\u201d Jun Xin seemed to be really angry and pulled Tang Doudou to leave right after spitting those words.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t expected for Jun Xin to know so much. If she knew earlier, she would\u2019ve just asked him instead of going through all this trouble to kidnap Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she recalled something. \u201cWait, Jun Xin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to know about what happened back then, I\u2019ll tell you about it while we travel. If we wait any longer, we won\u2019t be able to reach that place before the sun sets,\u201d said Jun Xin impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019ll only take a little while!\u201d Tang Doudou rushed back and kicked Bai Feiyun\u2019s leg. \u201cXiao Bai, how do I release my inner strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun responded with a slight smile, \u201cYou have so much inner strength that it\u2019s beyond the limit of what your body can handle, that\u2019s why I tried to seal half of it. If it\u2019s released, it\u2019ll damaged your meridians and might cause you to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I accidently released it. What would happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Tang Doudou then stooped over and pinched Bai Feiyun\u2019s jade-like cheek before saying with a sigh, \u201cXiao Bai ah, I\u2019m leaving now. When you go back, tell Su Yi that if he wants the Alliance Head Command Tablet, he should come ask me for it himself. I owe him a lot, so I\u2019d even give him my life. I really don\u2019t care about the tablet, but your actions pissed me off!\u201d</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he had forcefully stimulated her consciousness to ask her about the whereabouts of the tablet, she wouldn\u2019t have woken up so quickly.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun glanced at her with furrowed brows. He couldn\u2019t really understand why she was doing this, so he just repeated, \u201cCity Lord would never harm you, so why must you do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at him, then laughed coldly. \u201cHe won\u2019t harm me, but I know that he definitely didn\u2019t go to Cerulean Mountain just to get that one item.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s facial color changed slightly but it immediately went back to normal. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

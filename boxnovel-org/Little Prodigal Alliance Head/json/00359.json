Soon though, Tang Doudou heard heavy breathing come from not far in front of her. It sounded like the panting of someone doing heavy exercise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that you?\u201d Tang Doudou tried to light up the torch again to get a look, but that person stopped her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t light up that thing. I can\u2019t look at light.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou asked, astonished, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter being in the darkness for too long, light burns the eyes like fire.\u201d That person\u2019s tone was very sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really a person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already talked to you too much. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to believe, I won\u2019t repeat myself. In any case, anyone that stays here who doesn\u2019t die will become like me.\u201d When that person saw that Tang Doudou still didn\u2019t believe him, his voice became emotionless again.</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, this person was very familiar with this place. If she got to know this person more, she might be able to learn more about this place and Ninth Uncle\u2019s motives.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I believe you! I do!\u201d said Tang Doudou hastily.</p><br/><p>That person just said, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether you believe or not. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he said he\u2019d allow you to know the meaning of a true psychopath, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently remarked that it made a lot more sense even as she asked, \u201cWhy would you bother with me do to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d That person\u2019s laugh was chilling. \u201cBecause I\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fudge!</p><br/><p>How could she have forgotten that they were in a hole inside a sinkhole? Even if this person was human, his mental state definitely wasn\u2019t normal.</p><br/><p>However, the good thing was that this person still hasn\u2019t exhibited any weird symptoms.</p><br/><p>So this conversation could still be continued.</p><br/><p>However, the light swaying of the surroundings was starting to get stronger. Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know what Ninth Uncle intended to do, but she had already given up on the situation. She\u2019d just deal with things as they came.</p><br/><p>She felt for her flat bag of pickled plums. Hopefully, Baili Yiling and Mu Ye would be able to see that trail of pickled plums.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, is that so?\u201d Tang Doudou sat down on the ground and started revolving her energy to recover her inner strength. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said that person. Then he added, \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten. But it\u2019s been a very very long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I came in earlier, I saw that there were a lot of corpses outside. Were they people that died in here?\u201d</p><br/><p>That person was silent for a long while. Then he seemed to laugh. \u201cHe actually put the corpses outside? He sure is fearless. If someone found them, he\u2019d die countless deaths.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou latched onto this topic, \u201cDo you know what exactly he\u2019ll be doing? I want to be mentally prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMentally prepared? I\u2019d advise you to give up preparing and just leave before he actually does anything to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also want to leave, but that\u2019s easy to say and not so easy to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to leave,\u201d said that person.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was skeptical. If it was easy, why had he been trapped here for so long?</p><br/><p>That person seemed to guess what she was thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you came from outside, you\u2019ve definitely seen what this thing is. It\u2019s not very tall. With your qinggong, you\u2019ll be able to fly out. As for whether you\u2019ll be recaptured once you get out will depend on your luck. If you\u2019re lucky, he won\u2019t be guarding outside and your chances of escape will be 100%. If he is guarding outside and you can beat him or outrun him, your chances will be 50%. If you fail, then your fate will be having your meridians and limbs crushed before being thrown back in here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When that person got to his last sentence, his voice filled with intense hatred. Tang Doudou immediately realized why he said that it was easy to escape, but he didn\u2019t want to escape.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t try, but that he did and failed. His limbs and meridians had been ruined. That was why he would become so tired from moving that he\u2019d pant to catch his breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith how much he hate me, he definitely wouldn\u2019t leave until he sees with his own eyes that I\u2019m barely a breath away from death.\u201d Tang Doudou shook her head helplessly, then started walking forward in order to figure out where exactly that person was.</p><br/><p>She finally understood why she didn\u2019t see the person earlier. The first reason was because there was only a brief moment of light. The second was that the person\u2019s limbs were crushed, so he definitely wasn\u2019t standing. This means that while she was looking around, the person in front of her had been lying on the ground with his eyes shut tight. He only used his inner strength or some other method to extinguish the rolled torch once she turned around to look at the wall.</p><br/><p>So the question was, why couldn\u2019t she find the rock wall even though she had seen it earlier?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

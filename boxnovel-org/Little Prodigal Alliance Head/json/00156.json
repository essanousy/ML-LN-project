Crap! Hopefully, Mu Xinyu would be able to meet a good man soon and would stop longing for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rejecting a woman that\u2019s sent herself to your door? What are you faking decency for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou abruptly lifted her head and saw that Jun Xin, who had been gone for half a month, was crouching on top of the stone lion in front of the Alliance Head Residence entrance. He was chewing half a tanghulu as he played with the clean bamboo stick.</p><br/><p>\u201cFaking decency is at least better than being inhuman like some people!\u201d said Tang Doudou with a cold humph.</p><br/><p>Hell, she had still felt a little guilty about angering him off that day. She had been thinking of looking for him when she had time and bringing him some tasty treats!</p><br/><p>But now? No way in hell!</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Tang Doudou\u2019s disdainful tone, Jun Xin\u2019s face immediately darkened. He chewed the tanghulu as if chomping on Tang Doudou, making loud cracking noises. \u201cTry saying that one more time!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to repeat it just because you tell me to? If I did, what would happen to my reputation(face) as the Alliance Head daren?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head daren?\u201d Jun Xin suddenly laughed, then said with a slightly mocking tone, \u201cYou really do have a great reputation!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he jumped down from the stone lion and reached Tang Doudou in just a few steps. He came very close to her and towered over her with disdain on his face. The corners of his lips lifted slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shame that I don\u2019t feel like giving you face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou could only think of Jun Xin as a brat when seeing his baby face. She never realized until now that his figure was actually this large and tall. When he stood in front of her, he practically enveloped her. A seemingly subconscious oppressive aura radiated from him. Tang Doudou swallowed hard and made to put some distance between them. Unexpectedly, right after she moved back a couple of steps, Jun Xin grabbed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for you for something,\u201d said Jun Xin in a deep voice before she could ask.</p><br/><p>His tone was a little unfamiliar; it was completely different from his usual dissolute tone.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Tang Doudou felt like she had heard this type of tone somewhere before.</p><br/><p>It was familiar yet unfamiliar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat for ah?\u201d Seeing that Jun Xin\u2019s expression was serious, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but become nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. You\u2019ll know once we get there.\u201d Jun Xin grabbed her hand and started walking towards the street.</p><br/><p>His hand was as cold as that of a corpse. The moment Tang Doudou felt it, she got goosebumps. She reflexively tried to fling it away but she was gripped even more tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBehave, don\u2019t make me use force.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026where exactly are you bringing me?\u201d There was no way she could beat Jun Xin if it came to force. Tang Doudou was smart and didn\u2019t resist further. She believed that Jun Xin wouldn\u2019t do anything to harm her. As for this, it was just her hand that got cold. She could just treat it as free air-conditioning.</p><br/><p>Just as she was thinking this, she realized with surprise that the temperature of the hand holding hers was slowly rising. Following that was an endlessly sad and apologetic voice that almost dissipated in the wind before it reached her. \u201cSorry, I forgot\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, before she could ask what he had forgotten and before she could think about what was off about Jun Xin today, Jun Xin flew with her out of Huai City.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t fly very far though and landed in a small bamboo forest outside Huai City. The moment they landed, Jun Xin started walking into the forest.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know what was going on and could only follow after him to find out.</p><br/><p>After they walked for a while, Tang Doudou suddenly felt that the surroundings seemed familiar. However, she couldn\u2019t recall when she had been here before.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to wonder, this is the secret exit of Rutaceae Pavilion, where that underground palace is.\u201d Jun Xin was walking in front and didn\u2019t turn to look at Tang Doudou, but he still knew that she was definitely frowning as she tried to remember.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou made the connection the moment he said this. This was the place where she had almost burned to death!</p><br/><p>If Baili Yu hadn\u2019t arrived in time back then, she might already have gone to report to the King of Hell.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d asked Tang Doudou curiously.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t respond to her question and continued leading her inwards. He only stopped walking when they were above the underground palace.</p><br/><p>For the sake of finding that antique lamp, Baili Yu had sent people to dig through the entire palace. The scarred ground looked like a hornet\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had only heard about this. Now that she was looking at it, it was truly a spectacle too horrible to look at.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you spacing out for? Hurry up and come down with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

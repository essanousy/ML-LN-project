Why\u2019re you getting lighter the more you eat? You\u2019re pregnant with a little baby now, how can you be so skinny?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was speechless. If he wanted to talk, he should just talk. What did he mean by lifting her up?</p><br/><p>\u201cPut me back down!\u201d Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren were still here too! Even without turning to look, she could sense that the two kids were looking at her with strong disdain.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin laughed, then lifted his chin haughtily. He started strolling around the courtyard. \u201cHaha, I refuse! If you have the guts, just bite me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and put me down, otherwise I really will bite you! I still have important things to deal with, so stop messing around!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat important things? The current most important thing for you is to rest properly and recover. What are you wandering around for? I kept sending you looks earlier but you\u2019re just like a damned wood block. You didn\u2019t get it at all and even confidently spouted a bunch of useless things.\u201d As he was saying this, his originally playful expression turned sharp. \u201cSilly woman, don\u2019t you know that Xiao Qian has already started to hate you due to your hesitation earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was surprised. \u201cHow\u2019s that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she was observing him earlier, he didn\u2019t react with any displeasure?</p><br/><p>Jun Xin sighed helplessly when he saw how confused she looked. Then he lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWho\u2019s scared of him? With this little master here, he won\u2019t be able to touch you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fudge, everyone\u2019s already adults, so couldn\u2019t he be more civilized in the way he speaks?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you looking for?\u201d After Jun Xin wandered around the courtyard for a while, Tang Doudou finally couldn\u2019t stop herself from asking him this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour room ah! Aren\u2019t you tired from standing outside for such a long time?\u201d Jun Xin glanced down. The tenderness in his almond eyes caused Tang Doudou\u2019s heart to start pounding.</p><br/><p>She pushed him and said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ll bring you over but put me down. It\u2019d be bad if other people see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s smile stiffened. It was only now that he recalled that she was Baili Yu\u2019s wife and that she was even pregnant with Baili Yu\u2019s child.</p><br/><p>He had missed her so much and was so happy to see her that he forgot about this. These facts rained a bucket of cold water on his excitement.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t set her down and just used a mischievous expression to conceal the depression in his eyes. \u201cHm? Are you embarrassed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop wasting time and put me down!\u201d It was already bad enough that Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren saw, but if Baili Yu came back and saw, who knows how he would sort out this brat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse! If you\u2019re angry, just bite me to death!\u201d As Jun Xin was saying this, he was thinking that she might as well just bite him to death. That way he wouldn\u2019t have to suffer this pain anymore. Every time he recalled how he would never be able to have her, it felt like poison was seeping into his heart and making it pulse with pain.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was annoyed. She seriously didn\u2019t know what to do with him, but she also couldn\u2019t bring herself to bite him, so she just pointed towards a room. \u201cStop making me lose face and just bring me back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin smiled shamelessly. \u201cAiyah, stinkin\u2019 woman, you can\u2019t bear to bite me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you keep spouting nonsense, I\u2019ll just put poison into the food next time I cook and poison you to death!\u201d Even though she knew that this threat would be useless, she still said it to relieve some of her annoyance.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin carried Tang Doudou into the room and headed directly towards the bed. He settled her in carefully, then patted off the dust on his clothes before sitting down near the table. \u201cHave the people outside wait. Rest up properly before heading out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stop me?\u201d Tang Doudou thought that he would stop her from going to Barbarian Mound Garrison and had been trying to figure out a way to persuade him when he said this.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin played with the jade cup on the table, twirling it with his fingertip. His tone was filled with disdain as he said, \u201cShould I say that you\u2019re stupid or that you\u2019re so stupid it\u2019s cute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes and told herself that a mature woman didn\u2019t bicker with a brat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was in Huai City, I heard that the old guy with the surname Yu was gathering people to come to Azure Water Valley. I was worried that you guys wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it so I headed over with them. At first, I didn\u2019t want you to get involved, but as I was observing them, I found that Elder Yu and the four large clans\u2019 intentions weren\u2019t as simple as they were making them seem to be. That\u2019s why I stayed undercover to continue observing the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, unexpectedly, Shen Wuming showed up out of nowhere. He even knew the method to use the antique lamps, so I thought he was someone of the Seven Great Saint Tribes at first. However, later I found out that he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow exactly do you use the antique lamps?\u201d She had already been planning to ask Jun Xin to teach her how to use those lamps because it looked really powerful.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin furrowed his brows and he stopped toying with the cup. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it to you. It\u2019s really troublesome to explain\u2026 so just forget it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou: \u2026</p><br/><p>Then he continued, \u201cThe matter was complicated from the start. With Shen Wuming added on, now even I\u2019m confused about the situation. I was just about to investigate more when you idiotically jumped out with the intention of fighting Shen Wuming. That\u2019s why I had no choice but to step out and help you deal with that annoying guy! My entire plan became useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he scolded, \u201cAre you dumb? Couldn\u2019t you just behave and stay inside? First you headed out with such a crappy disguise that it was a miracle no one saw through it, but why are you so brainless? You managed to make it inside safely and you already got enough information to know that the situation was complicated! But you still stupidly rushed out? And you even kicked down the door?\u201d</p><br/><p>The more he said, the more irritated he got. He slammed the cup down on the table and paced around the room. \u201cI can\u2019t help but get angry whenever I think about it. You\u2019re no longer just yourself! You\u2019re pregnant with a little baby too! Why are you still acting like a crazy little kid? If you kicked too hard and your energy ended up affecting the fetus, what\u2019s going to happen to the baby? And Cang Baicao isn\u2019t in the valley right now either. What will happen to you? What is Baili Yu to do? What am I to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, Tang Doudou started feeling that she really had been too rash. She hadn\u2019t thought about the child in her belly at all\u2026 But what did this have to do with him?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was very speechless. She wanted to ask him why he was being such a busybody, but when she saw how angry he was and how he had been thinking of her this entire time, she stopped herself and just stared at the ceiling while quietly allowing those words to pass in and out of her ears.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin probably had a bit of a personality disorder, because after this burst of ranting, he started laughing again. The sound of his laughter made Tang Doudou\u2019s hair rise on end.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Xin, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat could be wrong with me?\u201d After laughing, Jun Xin returned to his usual unconcerned manner. \u201cSince you\u2019ve already decided to get involved in this matter, you can\u2019t drop it halfway. We\u2019ll just continue investigating to find out what exactly the mastermind is trying to do and who exactly he is!\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone became filled with excitement. Tang Doudou rubbed her head in confusion, then sat up. \u201cJun Xin, are you really alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin slapped the table, annoyed. \u201cI said I\u2019m fine, that means I\u2019m fine. If you have the time to worry about me, you might as well spend that time worrying about yourself.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

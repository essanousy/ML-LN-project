Before they even got to the topic, Tang Doudou had already pricked up her ears to listen.</p><br/><p>The afternoon was the best time to hear news in the inn. It was no wonder Baili Yu had dragged her out to eat. This had probably been his plan.</p><br/><p>However, this time, she had completely mistook Baili Yu\u2019s intentions. He had just wanted her to walk around a little.</p><br/><p>But since she seemed excited about the conversation, he didn\u2019t rush her and just called for the waiter to bring some tea and desserts. Everything he ordered was slightly sour. Tang Doudou ate a few pieces and found it quite tasty. Although she had already eaten her fill earlier, as she was eavesdropping, she ended up eating a lot more.</p><br/><p>She became puzzled. She seemed to be eating a lot lately.</p><br/><p>However, before she could think much about it, the person at that table continued, \u201cHeng Xuan Chamber of Commerce is changing owners!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy, didn\u2019t this news already go around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you know who the new owner is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t someone call Yi something? I heard she was Baili Yu\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that you\u2019re falling behind, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not her? That\u2019s not possible, she\u2019s his sister, who would be more suitable than her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at Baili Yu. That was true, if it came to inheritance, things would definitely fall to Baili Yiling, especially when Baili Yu\u2019s current condition was unknown and she had disappeared as well. Most importantly, hardly anyone knew about the fact that she and Baili Yu had gotten married, so most people would definitely find Yiling most suitable.</p><br/><p>However, that person wasn\u2019t talking about Baili Yiling, so could it be Yun Hai?</p><br/><p>Right after that thought emerged, Tang Doudou shook her head. Yun Hai had no way of convincing the masses to accept him.</p><br/><p>Although he was one of the three main subordinates of Baili Yu, there was still Jun Xin and Feng Long. Those two were extremely reliable, nothing would happen with them around. Even if Yun Hai had the desire to take over the chamber of commerce, they would stop him.</p><br/><p>However, what if something had happened to Jun Xin and Feng Long? After all, no one had gone to see Yun Hai since he came back, so no one knew why he ended up betraying Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>The most worrying factor was, if Baili Yiling wasn\u2019t the successor, her current environment would be very dangerous.</p><br/><p>These thoughts ran quickly through Tang Doudou\u2019s head and she listened even more carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Baili Yu is already dead, suitability can\u2019t be worried about anymore. That person is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Bro, stop teasing us. How about this, I\u2019ll pay for this meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI used a lot of effort to get this news you know. This dinner won\u2019t be a loss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou itched to just charge over to demand answers when he suddenly stopped at a cliffhanger. When she heard that the person often tricked people into giving him free meals, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he had purposefully made this up.</p><br/><p>However, she decided to just listen for now.</p><br/><p>When she pricked up her ears again though, she discovered that the two were now whispering to each other, so she couldn\u2019t hear them at all.</p><br/><p>She was so anxious that she decided to just go ask them, but Baili Yu pressed down on her hand and shook his head towards her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou calmed down and finished the pastry in her hand. \u201cI\u2019m full, let\u2019s head back to the room to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they headed upstairs, they passed right by the two, so Tang Doudou listened carefully in hopes of catching something.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed that they had already finished discussing it. All she heard was laughter as Baili Yu led her upstairs.</p><br/><p>After entering the room, Tang Doudou started jumping angrily. \u201cI\u2019ll head out later. We definitely have to figure out what\u2019s going on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Baili Yu glanced at her. \u201cI already know who it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Xin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPffff!\u201d Tang Doudou looked at him in astonishment. \u201cH-h-how is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu said, \u201cIt\u2019s very possible for it to be him.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou still was skeptical because this wasn\u2019t possible. Jun Xin hated those annoying matters, why would he choose to bind himself?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand, he\u2019s definitely only doing this because he had no other choice. We can only find out the details once we head back or make contact with Jun Xin, so don\u2019t worry about it. You believe that Jun Xin isn\u2019t this type of person, and I believe so too.\u201d Baili Yu pressed Tang Doudou down by the bed. \u201cFor now, you should rest properly and recover, Then we can think of a way to escape from the Seven Great Saint Tribes\u2019 pursuit and return to Huai City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou saw that he seemed unperturbed. She also understood that worrying now was no use. They were too far away, so the news that person had may have been spread a long time ago. Since they weren\u2019t clear on the situation, it was best not to make rash and pointless decisions.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu had Tang Doudou rest first while he headed out to see if he could get any more news.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. Baili Yu reminded her not to sleep too deeply so that she would wake up if someone approached.</p><br/><p>His nagging caused Tang Doudou to grumble about him being an old grannie, so finally, though he still didn\u2019t feel at ease, he headed out the door.</p><br/><p>After Baili Yu left, Tang Doudou started pacing around in the room. After a while, she asked the waiter to bring her some paper and she started going over her recent thoughts. However, the more she went over them, the more confused she became. In the end, she crumpled the paper and threw it on the ground. \u201cAh! My brain feels like it\u2019s about to explode! Why are there so many things!?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t do, I have to pull myself together! The world is still waiting for me to save it!</p><br/><p>\u201cSave a frick ah! If you go save the world, who will save you? Stupid Doudou ah, stupid Doudou.\u201d</p><br/><p>After wailing for a while, Tang Doudou finally rolled onto the bed. Even though she had pretty much slept through the last few days, she still felt very sleepy. This was probably the so-called autumn blues\u2026</p><br/><p>As she was thinking this, she fell deep asleep again.</p><br/><p>When Baili Yu got back and saw that she was sprawled all over the place, he reflexively shook his head. From the looks of it, it was best if he didn\u2019t head out while she was asleep. Otherwise it\u2019d be too late for regret if something happened.</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou had a lot on her mind, so even though she was very tired, her sleep was actually unusually shallow. The moment she heard footsteps, she opened her eyes in alarm. But when she saw that it was Baili Yu, she closed her eyes again. \u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

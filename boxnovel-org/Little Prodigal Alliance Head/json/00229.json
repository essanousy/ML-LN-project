She should be the one saying that.</p><br/><p>Despite that, she still stayed in his arms and greedily took in that comforting scent. She slowly closed her eyes. Staying together quietly like this was already pretty good.</p><br/><p>On a distant roof, Jun Xin looked away with calm expression. The moist night wind was a little chilly. Baili Yu was very lucky. He didn\u2019t even have the chance to hug her.</p><br/><p>He laughed softly. Standing up, he glanced over at the black-clothed person not far from him.</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, there was still a person even more pitiful than him. That person didn\u2019t even dare to show his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. Is it fun to peep on people flirting?\u201d With a flash, he reached that person\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>The black-clothed person\u2019s vigilance was very high. Before Jun Xin even finished speaking, the person had already disappeared from sight.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin looked back and folded his arms. \u201cLet me guess who you are. En. There\u2019s a scent on you that I\u2019m very familiar with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt her.\u201d The black-clothed man simply swept a brief glance towards him before gliding away like a black owl.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t chase after him and just looked down, lost in thought. In reality, he hadn\u2019t been able to guess who that person was just based on that familiar feeling. However, after that person spoke, he became pretty certain of the person\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>What confused him was, if it really was him, why would he be willing to appear at Tang Doudou\u2019s side as a black-clothed man?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he had some other motive?</p><br/><p>The day was finally over. Tang Doudou and Baili Yu held hands as they walked back to Propitious Clouds Inn, bathed in the warm light of the setting sun.</p><br/><p>However, before they even stepped inside, they heard earth-shattering wailing from inside.</p><br/><p>There was no one aside from Nangong Yan that would cry so heartbreakingly at Propitious Clouds Inn.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Baili Yu shared a look, then walked in together.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t see Nangong Yan when they walked in. The wailing sounded like it was coming from upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you go take a look? She\u2019s your little junior sister, your master\u2019s precious darling ah.\u201d Tang Doudou squeezed the large hand wrapped around hers and raised her brows.</p><br/><p>How could Baili Yu possibly dare to say yes when he heard her taunting tone?</p><br/><p>He curved his eyes and smiled as he replied, \u201cKids tend to like crying and making a fuss. She\u2019ll be fine after crying awhile, there\u2019s no need to mind it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfff!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. Wasn\u2019t this remark a little too mean! It was practically on par with Jun Xin\u2019s scheme.</p><br/><p>Had Nangong Yan heard, she probably would have been angered to the point she got internal injuries.</p><br/><p>She wholeheartedly wanted to be Baili Yu\u2019s sweet and charming wife, yet the person she was interested in treated her as a little kid. Just thinking about it, she seemed quite pitiful.</p><br/><p>And of course, the person involved wasn\u2019t sensitive enough to think of this and simply pulled her along past Nangong Yan\u2019s door as if he didn\u2019t hear a thing. He brought her to the third room on the hallway, pushed open the door, then led her in. \u201cYou must be tired out from today. Have a good rest. My room is right next door. If there\u2019s anything, just knock on the wall and I\u2019ll immediately come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked around the room. For some reason it seemed familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does this seem like the room from Plum Garden?\u201d Right after she asked, she realized that he had set this room up according to the layout in that room.</p><br/><p>But, why did he do that? She looked towards Baili Yu, a little confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard Jun Xin mention that you tend to be sensitive about where you sleep and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep well in a unfamiliar location. I was worried you\u2019d have trouble sleeping in Cloud City so I made a room exactly like the one in Plum Garden right after I got here. I had been waiting for you to come this entire time. I just never thought that at that time, you were\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She understood the logic now, but how did that stinkin\u2019 little brat know that she was sensitive about where she slept? She had never told anyone about that before!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

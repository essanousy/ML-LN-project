The moment she saw his eyes whirl, she knew what he was thinking. \u201cShe met with an accident in Cloud City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>Then Feng Wu actually said crap.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat crap?\u201d Su Yi saw that her expression had changed after she said crap. Her eyes were filled with schadenfreude as she said, \u201cI encountered Baili Yu outside Cloud City this afternoon. He\u2019s probably already in the city by now?\u201d</p><br/><p>It would have been better if she hadn\u2019t brought this up because this immediately caused Su Yi\u2019s suppressed anger to rise up again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s coming then let him come! As if I\u2019m afraid of him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Wu shrugged but ended up tugging at her injury. She inhaled sharply. \u201cWhat about that little gongzi of yours? The one surnamed Bai. Have him come out and help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thought that Tang Doudou was heavily injured never occurred to her. After all, this was Cloud City. Even if someone disliked Tang Doudou\u2019s presence, there was no way they\u2019d go so far as to try and kill her.</p><br/><p>Hence it surprised her when Su Yi sighed and said, \u201cWhether Xueyi will be able to survive this time will depend on Old Cang and Feiyun. From how lively you seem, you probably aren\u2019t too severely injured. Let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll help you treat those injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Feng Wu heard how serious he sounded, she started worrying as well and wanted to ask what exactly happened. However, when she saw the intense worry in Su Yi\u2019s eyes and recalled the familiar name she had heard earlier when she was on the roof, a trace of sadness flashed through her bright eyes and was immediately replaced by feigned anger. \u201cPei! You\u2019re definitely trying to snatch this chance to eat this ma\u2019am\u2019s tofu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Su Yi wasn\u2019t in the mood to chat with her, but when he heard this he couldn\u2019t help but refute, \u201cIt\u2019s already old tofu, who would still be interested!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi immediately met with a slap. Feng Wu said furiously, \u201cSu Yi, if you have the guts, repeat what you said one more time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would happen to my reputation if I spoke just because you told me to?\u201d Her slap barely tickled him. He was so used to it that he carried her into a nearby room without a pause. Moving with ease as if these movements had long become routine, he pulled out the necessary things from the medicinal chest in the room. \u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke lightly. If it had been anyone else, Feng Wu wouldn\u2019t have felt the slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram to the side, this ma\u2019am will do it herself.\u201d She walked up to snatch the medicinal vial out of Su Yi\u2019s hand but he caught her hand before she could.</p><br/><p>\u201cBehave, don\u2019t move around so much. You\u2019re always so rough with applying the medicine. Aren\u2019t you worried about the injuries leaving scars?\u201d Su Yi pushed her back onto the stool and turned her to face the table before ripping apart the clothing on her back. \u201cMoreover, you and I are already so old. It couldn\u2019t be that we still worry about things like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though that was what he said, he still felt stunned by the sight of the snow-white back and hastily distracted himself by pouring out the medicine and sprinkling it over the wounds.</p><br/><p>Medicine inevitably caused pain when it makes contact with wounds. Feng Wu gave a soft suppressed moan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t force yourself to endure it. You\u2019ll feel better if you just let it out!\u201d In the end Su Yi was still someone who had lived for a long time. The feeling only lasted for a moment before he returned to normal and started carefully sprinkling the medicinal powder over all the wounds on Feng Wu\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>He was just about to help wrap her wounds up with gauze when he heard Cang Baicao\u2019s worried shout. \u201cSomeone! Did everyone die!? Hot water ah, hot water!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi only recalled the matter with the hot water when he heard Cang Baicao shout as if he was trying to summon a ghost. He immediately shoved the medicinal bottle into Feng Wu\u2019s hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get some hot water first. You can treat the wounds in front yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Before Feng Wu could stop him, he was already gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy City Lord daren ah! Where the heck did you go? Where\u2019s the hot water?\u201d Cang Baicao was so anxious that he was covered with sweat. When he finally saw Su Yi\u2019s old face, he was beside himself with relief.</p><br/><p>Su Yi immediately squeezed into the kitchen. The servant girl that was looking after the fire had already fallen asleep. Luckily it seemed that she hadn\u2019t been asleep long as the water in the pot was still boiling. Su Yi took out the cask he had prepared earlier, filled it with hot water, then lifted it and started running towards the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hot water\u2019s here. Old Cang, how\u2019s Xueyi right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeiyun\u2019s still sewing her up. Her current state is unclear, but she\u2019ll probably be fine.\u201d Cang Baicao hadn\u2019t expected for Bai Feiyun to be able to suture this well despite it being his first time either. Moreover, Bai Feiyun\u2019s endurance was better than his so they were finishing much faster than he had predicted.</p><br/><p>He was thinking these thoughts as he spoke, but the words he said scared Su Yi quite badly. Su Yi stumbled and almost dropped the hot water he was carrying. He stared dumbstruck at Cang Baicao. After confirming that it wasn\u2019t a joke, he said between gritted teeth, \u201cCang Baicao, you\u2019re actually treating Xueyi\u2019s life as a trifling matter and using her as teaching material for your disciple!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Abominable! It was too abominable!</p><br/><p>Su Yi really wanted to kill right now!</p><br/><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t get so stirred up. Put the water in there first, then I\u2019ll explain to you about it.\u201d When Cang Baicao saw Su Yi\u2019s murderous gaze, he immediately became worried that Su Yi would actually kill him out of anger and hastily pushed the cask back into Su Yi\u2019s arms as he pointed towards the room.</p><br/><p>No matter how angry Su Yi was, he didn\u2019t dare to joke with Tang Doudou\u2019s life. He lifted the cask and entered the room. Right after he entered, he saw Bai Feiyun who was covered in sweat yet still had an abnormally calm expression as his fingers moved rapidly. The flesh gradually folded close next to his hand. From the looks of it, things were progressing quite well.</p><br/><p>When Su Yi saw this, his rage receded without needing Cang Baicao\u2019s explanation. He watched for a little while longer, then left because he found he couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Cang, when did you teach Bai Feiyun that?\u201d He knew Bai Feiyun\u2019s level of medical expertise well. Although he was much better than those quack doctors outside, it could only be said to be proficient. It couldn\u2019t be compared with Cang Baicao, this kind of Saint Doctor\u2019s level. However, what he was doing right now was something only a doctor at the level of a Godly Doctor could do, so Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but be curious.</p><br/><p>As of now, all that needed to be done was to finish up, so there was no need for Cang Baicao to keep a tight eye on Bai Feiyun. Upon hearing this, Cang Baicao laughed \u2018hehe\u2019 and said, \u201cEven if I want to teach him, he has to be willing to learn ah! I wasn\u2019t the one who taught him this. However, that technique looks very familiar. I seem to have seen it somewhere, but for some reason I can\u2019t remember where\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi was stunned. There was actually a way to suture that Cang Baicao didn\u2019t know of?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

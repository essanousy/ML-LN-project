Everyone standing on the ground hastily used their martial arts to dodge those tiles.</p><br/><p>After Jun Xin fell, he immediately tried to rush back up to see what exactly happened to Tang Doudou, but Qing Yin hurriedly stopped him, \u201cYoung Master Jun, let\u2019s look at the situation first!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Mu Ye\u2019s expression immediately changed as he looked with incomparable shock at the white light in the midst of that chaotic cloud of smoke. With a swish, he retrieved his iron chain which had barely retained half its original length. This was forged cold cast iron, yet it had actually broken from the force of that vibration!? How could Li Xueyi possess such indomitable inner strength? It was inconceivable!</p><br/><p>Inside his sleeve, his hand was dripping with blood. The vein near his purlicue* had actually been severed by the power of the vibration transmitted through the iron chain!</p><br/><p>The area between your thumb and forefinger. In Chinese, it\u2019s called the \u2018tiger\u2019s den\u2019.</p><br/><p>The shock in his heart was too great.</p><br/><p>Originally, he should have already rushed to leave at this time. Otherwise, once Jun Xin returned to his senses and reacted, leaving would become troublesome. Not to mention, he had even been injured, so dying here was now a possibility.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment he just stared rigidly towards that direction, his eyes lit with a cold light and his body not moving an inch. No matter what, if he left without getting to the bottom of this he would definitely feel regret!</p><br/><p>At this time, Jun Xin was also too busy focusing on Tang Doudou to pay attention to him. After being stopped by Qing Yin, he also stood there with his eyes fixed in that direction. If there was even the slightest sign of some unexpected development, he was prepared to immediately rush over.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, after exploding, Tang Doudou only felt that her entire body was filled with energy. She felt incomparably comfortable and even had an impulse to continue roaring towards the sky. She stood on a roof beam, broken pieces of tiles and iron chain all below her feet. Everything surrounding her had been crushed by the vibration into fine powder. It lingered in the air, making it hard for the people outside to discern her figure for quite a while.</p><br/><p>Even though it was said that her entire body was filled with strength, she couldn\u2019t hear a single sound from outside clearly. All she could see was the shape of their mouths moving as they pointed and gestured in her direction. She wanted to call out but discovered that she couldn\u2019t make any noise.</p><br/><p>What exactly happened to her body?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou who was standing motionless in place was very much at a loss. She swept her eyes around and noticed that Jun Xin was standing nearby and looking this way with concern. Joy lit up her face. That\u2019s it! He\u2019d definitely know what was going on!</p><br/><p>As she thought that, she made to walk towards Jun Xin. But her leg had just moved when her entire body fell straight down like a snapped kite.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had been staring in that direction without blinking from the start. The moment he saw something falling, he hastily rushed over like a storm.</p><br/><p>But at this time, there was actually someone that was faster than him; a startlingly magnificent red figure. Even the smoke and dust that filled the skies were incapable of masking his God-like grandeur. With the grace of a swan, he arrived in a blink in front of Jun Xin. After a slight pause, he reached the falling object and extended his hand gracefully, catching the Tang Doudou that fell from the roof beam.</p><br/><p>Everything happened in a split second. By the time Jun Xin came near, Tang Doudou was panic-strickenly hugging Baili Yu\u2019s neck with a death grip as she cried, \u201cBig evil spirit, I was almost scared to death! Wuuwuuwuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin felt a slight pain in his heart as he looked with confusion towards the Baili Yu that had suddenly appeared. He used his eyes to question him. Didn\u2019t he say that reins over the entire matter were handed to him? Why did he suddenly appear?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye has already left.\u201d Baili Yu just gave this tepid sentence without looking at him.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou who was scared dumb by this sudden event was crying, but she still heard what Baili Yu said in his low voice. She hastily stopped crying and lifted her head to look around, then asked with a sobbing tone, \u201cThat bastard, he really left?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wuuwuuwuu, that Mu Demon really is a big bastard ah! She always ends up close to dying every time she encounters him.</p><br/><p>From what she said, it didn\u2019t seem that she was that affected by the incident. Jun Xin loosened a breath in relief. As he thought about it again, he recalled that Baili Yu didn\u2019t know of Li Xueyi\u2019s female identity. The only reason he kept saving Tang Doudou over and over again was probably just for the sake of his plan.</p><br/><p>After all, in his heart, there was no other matter under the heavens that was more important than that particular plan of his.</p><br/><p>He only wishes that he was overthinking it. Jun Xin was silent for a while, then said: \u201cI\u2019ll go pursue Mu Ye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s narrow peach blossom eyes concealed a radiance, \u201cHe was quite severely injured and won\u2019t be appearing in the city for a while. Let him rest a couple days before going to find him. At that time, I think he\u2019ll probably be finished making up his mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin thought about it a little. In any case, he was just helping out. As long as it didn\u2019t affect his benefits and didn\u2019t touch his bottom line, whatever Baili Yu wanted was fine with him!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after that sentence came out, the two simultaneously looked at the Tang Doudou that had her head deeply buried in Baili Yu\u2019s chest with her body arched like an ostrich. Baili Yu reached out to push her dusty head away, his entire face strangely dark.</p><br/><p>Originally, he could have sat back and watched her fall like a play without acting.</p><br/><p>Yet the moment he saw Jun Xin rush forward, displeasure surfaced in his heart and his body subconsciously moved forward. Only after he caught Tang Doudou did he realize what he did.</p><br/><p>And this wasn\u2019t the first time.</p><br/><p>It has only been a couple of days since they\u2019ve met, yet it was already the third time he saved him this way.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu gave a light sigh. What exactly was going on?</p><br/><p>If it was anyone else, he would have felt uncomfortable with someone this filthy being near him. But this guy just kept getting filthier and filthier every time he hugged him, yet he still didn\u2019t feel any revulsion. On the contrary, he actually felt that it was kind of comfortable, and the soft handfeel wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>Thinking to here, Baili Yu\u2019s face turned completely black. What exactly happened to him!?</p><br/><p>He looked at Tang Doudou again as if he were some strange creature and discovered that he had fainted.</p><br/><p>After staring at him for half a beat, Baili Yu slightly lifted his hands, preparing to throw this loathsome guy out. But when his gaze landed on that thoroughly red nose, he hesitated again and felt a bit angry. It\u2019s already peeling! Why did he head out without even rubbing some medicine on it?</p><br/><p>Jun Xin, who was standing nearby, watched as Baili Yu\u2019s facial expression went through a series of rapid changes. A bad feeling emerged in his heart.</p><br/><p>He gave Baili Yu an odd look. He, he couldn\u2019t have also fallen for Li Xueyi, right!?T/N</p><br/><p>For a while, he became a bit befuddled. Baili Yu had never been tempted by female charms because he actually liked men?</p><br/><p>This was far far from good. If Baili Yu realized that he liked guys, but then found out that Li Xueyi was, in fact, a girl, he might kill Li Xueyi in a fit of anger.</p><br/><p>To hate homosexuality the most, yet end up falling for a guy. And yet this guy was actually a girl. Most people wouldn\u2019t be able to accept that rapid change in circumstances, much less someone like Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>You better not trust his always smiling appearance. He may seem very reasonable and easy to talk to sometimes, but once he turns twisted, even demons would retreat three days\u2019 march. If it was asked who it was that understood Baili Yu the most, the answer would most likely be Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>This smile-masked fox isn\u2019t a good person at all!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no good! He can\u2019t let Li Xueyi fall into such a predicament!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him back first! And then I\u2019ll find a doctor to take a look at him and find out what exactly was with that sudden explosion of inner strength!\u201d Jun Xin said as he decisively headed over.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Baili Yu recalled that enormous inner strength from earlier. At that time, he was also greatly surprised. No one knew how profound Li Xueyi\u2019s inner strength was in the past, but the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance was capable of completely dispersing a person\u2019s inner strength and would even destroy the dantian. So his body shouldn\u2019t be able to hold even the least bit of inner strength. Previously, he had already verified that there was not even a bit of inner strength in his body. So who did that tremendous amount of inner strength come from?</p><br/><p>All he could do was re-examine this matter.</p><br/><p>As he thought so, he reached out and checked Tang Doudou\u2019s pulse. Baili Yu\u2019s brows slightly knitted as he shook his head, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. This was caused by the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance; ordinary doctors are useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Disseminating Tassel Fragrance again. Jun Xin wiped the Bloodthirster in his hand and returned it to its scabbard. Then, he asked with puzzlement, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you cure his poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not urgent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to experimentally verify on his body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is there in his body that needs me to experimentally verify? You\u2019re thinking too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Qin Yin entered, leading everyone from the Alliance Head Residence. \u201cAlliance Head, you\u2019re not injured, right!!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right ah, you almost scared us to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah! The Alliance Head seems to have fainted!\u201d</p><br/><p>The was crowd scrambling their way in when the people in front suddenly stopped. Due to that, the people following behind them couldn\u2019t stop in time and crashed into them. Just as they were noisily apologizing, someone suddenly shouted, \u201cIs-isn\u2019t this Baili gongzi!? When did he arrive!?\u201d</p><br/><p>After blurting that out, he hurriedly covered his mouth and looked nervously at Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t even look at the surrounding people. Carrying Tang Doudou, he directly leaped into the sky. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared over the wall of the Plum Garden.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster has left so Young Master Jun, we should leave as well. Gongzi can deal with this matter himself once he recovers!\u201d Qing Yin said softly after she walked up.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s true. Let\u2019s head back first to look at what exactly happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, the two were about to leave, yet Elder Yu wouldn\u2019t have it. The people of the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce always came with the wind and left with the rain. Coming whenever they felt like it and leaving whenever they felt like it, what were they treating the Alliance Head Residence as?</p><br/><p>They were treating it like an inn or a teahouse!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two ahead, please stay your steps!\u201d Once Elder Yu saw that Jun Xin was about to walk out the entrance, he hastily called out to them.</p><br/><p>Even though he was infuriated and really wanted to demand answers from them, he couldn\u2019t avoid using a polite tone. Elder Yu couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Who asked for the other party to be people from the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce?</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t do not to be polite ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yu, we still have a lot of matters to take care of. If it\u2019s not something urgent, then we will take our leave first!\u201d Qing Yin swept a glance at the completely annoyed Jun Xin and hastily replied to Elder Yu.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu looked at Jun Xin and, recalling the aura of that blood colored sword, felt lingering trepidation. The name of Blood Fiend sure wasn\u2019t in vain!</p><br/><p>But recalling his purpose, he gave a light cough and asked, \u201cLao fu just wanted to ask Young Master Jun as to what exactly Baili gongzi\u2019s intentions are. Why is he repeatedly taking the Alliance Head away? The martial arts circles cannot remain in the state of being a group of dragons without a head for overly long. An explanation must be given for this matter ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin cast a sidelong glance and coldly replied, \u201cThis matter isn\u2019t something I can interfere in. If you want an explanation, go look for Baili Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he flew onto the wall, light as a butterfly. Then, he shifted his gaze towards Qing Yin and asked, \u201cQing Yin, why are you still standing there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin curtsied towards Elder Yu, said a word of goodbye, then flew away with Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>The remaining people in the Alliance Head Residence looked at each other. What sort of event was happening here?</p><br/><p>The Alliance Head had returned and everyone had been happy. But in a blink, the Alliance Head was taken away again!</p><br/><p>What exactly did Baili Yu mean by this?</p><br/><p>Was he really treating the Alliance Head Residence as the Plum Garden\u2019s back garden? Ay ay, people with power are just this awesome. Even the Old Heavens wouldn\u2019t be able to bar his path. Wherever he wanted to go, it would be level ground.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Syndicate Leader Xu, who was hiding behind the entrance, jogged out and took this opportunity to move close to Elder Yu. He whispered in Elder Yu\u2019s ear, \u201cElder Yu, the person\u2019s already left. So how are we supposed to handle Bai gongzi\u2019s matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

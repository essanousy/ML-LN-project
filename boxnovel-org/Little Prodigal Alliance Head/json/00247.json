Elope?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. If you really don\u2019t want Baili Yu anymore, then just elope with me!\u201d Jun Xin looked at her offhandedly, but inwardly, he was extremely nervous.</p><br/><p>If Tang Doudou nodded, he\u2019d definitely take her away without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I were to elope, I wouldn\u2019t do it with a brat like you!\u201d Tang Doudou jumped up from her chair. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t notice the nervousness and earnestness hidden behind his laid-back tone, but she seriously couldn\u2019t bring herself to let go of Baili Yu. Even now, when she was furious, she still cared about that damned evil spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m just joking. Old lady, you couldn\u2019t have thought that this young master was offering for real, right?\u201d Jun Xin\u2019s heart squeezed with pain but he put on an overly bright smile. Reaching out, he patted Tang Doudou on the back of her head before striding past those chairs and heading towards the exit. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming? Could it be that you want to spend the night here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s nose stung as she watched him leave with a big smile, but she held back her tears. This dumb kid.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin originally wanted to send Tang Doudou back to the residence, but she didn\u2019t want to go back so he could only find an inn for her to stay in.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust go to sleep. Everything will be fine when you wake up.\u201d Jun Xin stood at the door and spoke to her in an impatient tone. After he finished speaking, he closed the door.</p><br/><p>Standing with his back against the door, he sighed, then slapped himself lightly. Hadn\u2019t he already made his decision? Why did he waver again?</p><br/><p>After spending a while frustrated with himself, he glanced towards the room behind him.</p><br/><p>He should just explain to her tomorrow about what Baili Yu was doing!</p><br/><p>However, when he left the inn and jumped onto the roof, he saw that Baili Yu was standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d He rubbed his head, feeling a bit guilty because of what he had said earlier.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu turned towards him. \u201cQing Moran refuses to cooperate, so I came to find you for help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t cooperate? Isn\u2019t it more like you aren\u2019t trying? If you were willing to hook a finger and sell your looks a little, how could she refuse to behave?\u201d He actually came because of this little matter rather than for Tang Doudou? Jun Xin who was originally still feeling guilty immediately became irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really aren\u2019t going?\u201d Baili Yu didn\u2019t get angry and continued speaking softly in his usual tone that contained a hint of a smile.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin glanced at the smile that he had been a little scared of since childhood, then shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll go, how could I not go? However, Qing Moran probably doesn\u2019t like my type.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he jumped off the roof. However, he seemed to recall something and turned around. \u201cIf we leave, what about Tang Doudou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going, I\u2019m not.\u201d Baili Yu smiled at him. \u201cWhen you get back, help me throw Bai Lianhua into the sea!\u201d</p><br/><p>His words showed that he had already found out about today\u2019s events.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin felt a bit unwilling. Although Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t agreed when he asked her today, she might\u2019ve agreed after Baili Yu treated her coldly a few days.</p><br/><p>However, that thought formed, he felt that he was being ridiculous. Shooting Baili Yu a disdainful eye roll, he said, \u201cHow come I have to be the bad guy every single time?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, she had confirmed now that there definitely wouldn\u2019t be any danger and had decided before going to sleep that she would tell them she was leaving today. She hadn\u2019t expected for Yu Fenger to have already arranged it all for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, this was what I was planning too.\u201d Tang Doudou packed up a little, then saw Jin Longbiao bringing over some brothers with decent martial arts skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are the Wu family brothers. They often go to Huai City to handle matters so they know the road well and are also very astute. Just let them follow you from now on!\u201d Golden Wind Jade Dew found out that Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know martial arts yesterday while they were talking and didn\u2019t feel at ease letting her go off on her own on a journey. That was why they carefully selected three of their own trusted subordinates for her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was naturally delighted with this surprise. In all honesty, there was no way she wasn\u2019t scared about going to Huai City on her own. She wasn\u2019t familiar with the road and she had to be on guard against Elder Yu and the Demonic Sect\u2019s attacks. It was possible for her to die at any moment from the slightest carelessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Li greets Third Chief!\u201d (Wu(martial arts) Li(strength))</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Qing greets Third Chief!\u201d (Wu(martial arts) Qing(clear/quiet))</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Lu greets Third Chief!\u201d (Wu(martial arts) Lu(shore/land))</p><br/><p>These three brothers were quite enthusiastic. Tang Doudou was happy to see this and nodded. \u201cIn the future don\u2019t call me Third Chief anymore, just call me Doudou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood! Lady Doudou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Forget it, if it\u2019s Lady Doudou then so be it. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to make them change their way of address after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou, we\u2019ll be able to rest easy knowing that they\u2019re with you. The Jianghu is full of dangers, you must be careful!\u201d From start to finish Yu Fenger never asked Tang Doudou what exactly she was off to do; he didn\u2019t even ask who Tang Doudou was. \u201cIf you need our help, just let us know! We won\u2019t hesitate even if we need to walk through water and tread on fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was very moved hearing this. Yu Fenger really treated her exceptionally well. From now on, she had to treat them wholeheartedly too. As for her earlier idea of roping them in to help her, she decided to abandon it. There was no way she could allow them to accompany her in taking risks!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Yu, don\u2019t send me off any further. I\u2019ll rush back to see you guys as soon as I finish dealing with my matters.\u201d Tang Doudou felt rather helpless as she looked at Yu Fenger who had already been seeing her off for several hundred meters.</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger still couldn\u2019t bear to leave her. The rims of his eyes were red and tears continuously dropped down. \u201cThen, how about I go with you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it had been before, Tang Doudou may have agreed but now she firmly rejected the idea. \u201cGreen Summit Stronghold won\u2019t be able to go on without Big Brother Yu, not to mention Big Brother Jin needs you as well. Could it be that you can bear parting with Big Brother Jin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pulling out Jin Longbiao was the most effective method to combat Yu Fenger\u2019s weeping.</p><br/><p>As expected, Yu Fenger immediately stopped talking about going with Tang Doudou when she said he would have to part with Jin Longbiao. However, he was still extremely reluctant to let her go and kept reminding her, \u201cThen you have to come back and look for us soon. Make sure to eat on time and sleep on time. When it gets cold, remember to wear more layers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He prattled on about a great bunch. It was still alright hearing it once but hearing it over and over again really drove people crazy. Tang Doudou finally understood the pain of being nagged at by a mother.</p><br/><p>In the past when she saw people complain, she had jeered at them for not knowing to cherish it. However, now she could relate.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Yu, if you keep nagging the sun will set!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, can\u2019t you tell that it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to part with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Big Brother Yu, you had better head back soon. Don\u2019t let Big Brother Jin worry too long. I\u2019m leaving now!\u201d Tang Doudou was worried that Yu Fenger would keep nagging her and hastily climbed onto the horse. She called the Wu family brothers, then waved goodbye to Yu Fenger.</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she rode off in the direction of Huai City with the three brothers following after her.</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger watched until her figure disappeared, then gave a small sigh as he turned to head back to Green Summit Stronghold. The back of his short figure was conspicuously dejected.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When she got to that protruding soft area, she gave it a big slap. \u201cDoes big sister like it when I\u2019m this bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>This is basically my rearrangement of a little rhyme in Chinese which basically says that women are attracted to bad boys.</p><br/><p>Boy? She saying she\u2019s a male?</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, how hateful!\u201d The woman grabbed hold of Tang Doudou\u2019s hand and gave Tang Doudou a bashful look. Only then did she realize that Tang Doudou\u2019s chest was flat and that her hair was pulled up. If one didn\u2019t look closely, this person really did give off the feeling of a charming gongzi. Could it be that he wasn\u2019t a woman but a pretty youngster disguised as a woman?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like this kind of thing hasn\u2019t been seen in the brothels before. Some young gongzis come from strict families and they would disguise themselves as women in order to sneak out to play. However, their true identities were always immediately revealed when they got here and got on the bed.</p><br/><p>And then there were also gongzis from rich families who simply liked female garments and crossdressing.</p><br/><p>This woman had grown up in the pleasure quarters so she had seen plenty of occurrences like this. Thus the surprise on her face soon disappeared. Instead, an even more flirtatious smile appeared on her lips as she pressed her soft, seemingly boneless body against Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Though she was a woman of the pleasure quarters, she still liked handsome men, not dainty women. When she came to the conjecture that Tang Doudou was likely a man, she became even more eagerly attentive. After all, men were much easier to serve than women!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pulled the woman off her body and, smiling devilishly, lifted her brows at Qing He. Pulling the woman with her, she started walking towards Qing He.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing He ah, don\u2019t say that I don\u2019t look after you. This lady is top quality goods.\u201d With a tug, Tang Doudou shifted the woman to her front and pushed her towards Qing He.</p><br/><p>\u201cHug her properly, don\u2019t lose her alright? Since we\u2019re already here, you should just have fun without worrying about anything, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of disgust flashed through Qing He\u2019s eyes as she watched the woman fall towards her. How was such a filthy woman fit for her to hug?</p><br/><p>Qing He felt that Tang Doudou was getting increasingly carried away and had gone too far. She couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She pushed the woman aside towards the ground, then walked to Tang Doudou with a cold expression on her face. \u201cLady Doudou, if you don\u2019t stop now, then forgive this servant for being impolite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou only laughed \u2018hehe\u2019 in response to Qing He\u2019s threat. Then, she pulled Qing He into her arms. \u201cLittle Qing He\u2019s angry appearance is seriously cute. This Alliance Head couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of Qing Yin, that adorable little lass. Since Little Qing He is that concerned about this Alliance Head, why don\u2019t you accompany me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Qing He never expected such shameless words to come out of Tang Doudou, a woman\u2019s, mouth. She was so infuriated that her face turned blue, then white. However, she didn\u2019t dare to defy Master\u2019s orders so all she could do was give a cold humph. Since she couldn\u2019t do anything to Tang Doudou and she had no interest in watching Tang Doudou commit more outrageous acts, she decided to just go stand guard in the corridor. She directed her gaze into the distance towards some unknown scene.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou felt sure that Qing He wouldn\u2019t come bother her anymore, she pulled the woman up from the ground and drew her into her arms. Then she called for several other ladies and entered a room not far away. The door closed with a \u2018bang\u2019. The women left in the corridor who hadn\u2019t managed to squeeze into the room in time stomped their feet, then unwillingly dispersed.</p><br/><p>The corridor that had still been crowded just moments ago instantly became empty. The only person left standing there was Qing He who was gritting her teeth in anger.</p><br/><p>She had decided that no matter what punishment she would receive, she would still tell Master about this incident so that Master could sort out this hateful Tang Doudou. Leaving aside the fact that she brought her to a brothel, she actually even wanted her to accompany her?</p><br/><p>Had she gone crazy?</p><br/><p>Even Master had confirmed that she was a woman, not a man, so how could she do things like this without any restraint? It\u2019s intolerable!</p><br/><p>When it occurred to Qing He that this hateful person would become her future female master, she became very depressed. It felt like the future ahead was pitch-black.</p><br/><p>Qing He was focused on thinking about how to complain to Baili Yu about Tang Doudou and completely did not notice that Tang Doudou, who had been pushed into the room by a large crowd of ladies, was currently jumping out of the window with a serious expression on her face.</p><br/><p>She landed lightly on the roof of the opposite building as she concentrated her line of sight in front.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a figure dropped down from the roof in front of her and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou knew that this wasn\u2019t coincidence at all and that he was purposefully doing this so that she would follow. Earlier, when she was outside Pleasure Seeking House, this person had been in the crowd and showed her something in his hand, then indicated for her to shake off Qing He and follow him.</p><br/><p>That was why the earlier scene had occurred.</p><br/><p>After another moment of hesitation, Tang Doudou chased after him. The two were not far apart so she soon arrived below the building. Her figure flashed and she landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>As of now, her control over qinggong was becoming increasingly better, it was almost second nature.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou only realized that this place was a shabby little courtyard when she landed. The area was in such decline that it was obvious no one had set foot in here for a long time.</p><br/><p>Why exactly did that person lead her over here?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou thought about it a little. However, she couldn\u2019t afford to waste time since Qing He was still guarding the room in the brothel so she simply started looking around the courtyard with her guard up.</p><br/><p>Right after she moved, the figure in front of her flashed again. He was actually leaving the courtyard.</p><br/><p>The place he wanted to bring her to wasn\u2019t this courtyard? Tang Doudou considered it a little but decided to continue following him. That person\u2019s qinggong wasn\u2019t half as good as hers but Tang Doudou was curious about where he wanted to lead her so she didn\u2019t attempt to catch up. She simply followed after the person at a good pace. That person made several turns before finally stopping next to a river. He stood there with his back facing Tang Doudou. It seemed like he was waiting for her to reach him.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou slowly started to descend as well. She looked around and soon recognized this place to be the southwest area of Mist City. There was a river here called Clear Dream. The water was an unusual moss green color and in the mild sunlight, it glowed a faint green.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? What is your intention in leading me here?\u201d Tang Doudou stopped five meters away from the person. This distance was enough to ensure that she had enough time to react and escape if anything dangerous occurred.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she had extremely fast qinggong, she wouldn\u2019t have followed him even if someone threatened to beat her to death.</p><br/><p>The person didn\u2019t say anything, nor did he turn around. He simply threw the object in his hand towards her.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

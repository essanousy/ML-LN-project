Finding out what she was planning before coming up with a countermeasure would be ideal. In any case, although this matter was said to be urgent, it wasn\u2019t really that urgent. The time limit given by the Demonic Sect was seven days and Cloud Sun City wasn\u2019t that far from here. No matter what, they\u2019d be able to make it in time.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at Elder Yu\u2019s eager eyes and opened her mouth hesitantly, before shaking her head and closing her mouth again, as if she wanted to speak but didn\u2019t dare to. Elder Yu got extremely anxious seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it some personal matter that can\u2019t be made known publicly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter, there are no outsiders present. Alliance Head, you should just say it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shook her head adamantly.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu was irritated to the point that his beard was about to be huffed flying. Yet, he just couldn\u2019t flare up towards her. In his sullen mood, he actually managed to laugh and say, \u201cThen what exactly does Alliance Head want to do? Alliance Head should at least give everyone an explanation, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tsk tsk, now he\u2019s starting to pull a tiger skin* again.</p><br/><p>What I translated pretty literally to \u2018pull a tiger skin\u2019 is . A tiger is a fierce animal, so there\u2019s this saying , waving a flag like it\u2019s a tiger skin, which refers to revolutionaries using their flags to intimidate people as if their flag is a tiger skin/aka representation of their strength. So, Elder Yu is pretending to speak for \u2018everyone\u2019 and trying to pressure Tang Doudou into giving an answer. I think\u2026 correct me if I\u2019m wrong~</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou disdainfully curled her lips and scorned at this outdated trick as she hesitantly asked, \u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Yu nodded solemnly, \u201cAlliance Head\u2019s matter is everyone\u2019s matter. As long as Alliance Head tells us, we will help Alliance Head with all our strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people behind him also echoed one after another, \u201cElder Yu is right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, you should just say it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely ah. We still have to save Bai gongzi once we\u2019re done with this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s not my matter, it\u2019s Elder Yu\u2019s.\u201d After hesitating again and again while pacing back and forth several times, Tang Doudou saw that she had reached her intended effect and finally spoke while looking towards Elder Yu with a helpless expression.</p><br/><p>Wha? Elder Yu\u2019s head was filled with question marks. What exactly did she mean? How did he get pulled into the topic?</p><br/><p>And she even said it was more important than saving Bai Feiyun, this\u2026 For some unknown reason, Elder Yu started feeling a strong sense of unease. He seemed to have realized what Tang Doudou wanted to do.</p><br/><p>However, he still couldn\u2019t figure out her exact plans. It was seriously difficult to bear ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yu\u2019s matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat matter could Elder Yu possibly have!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou took a long inhale and took over the discussion, \u201cIt\u2019s precisely the matter of Madam Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Yu choked on a mouthful of old blood as he turned fiercely to look towards Li Hong. Other than him, there was no one else that had such big nerves as to tell Li Xueyi about this matter. No wonder she asked him about the injury on his face the moment she had walked through the door. She actually was digging this huge hole so that he would have to jump around over here*!</p><br/><p>In general, the word , which translates to hole, pit, to defraud, is used in an expression  (pretty much literally \u2018cheat person\u2019), with the expressed meaning of \u2018I can\u2019t accept this, this is like fraud!\u2019. This is cause there are two meanings. The first meaning is meeting with an unlucky/crappy situation, like when you fall into a hole. The other meaning is being deceived, implying that someone dug that hole for you to fall into.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, I\u2019ll venture to be so bold as to ask, why is Madam Yu and Elder Yu\u2019s matter even more important than saving Bai gongzi?\u201d Someone asked quite pertinently.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin, feeling that it was about time to shift the topic. She had to suspend Elder Yu\u2019s appetite so that his thinking won\u2019t be as clear. Only through this way would she have the advantage in the following development. And so, Tang Doudou started to give a long explanation, \u201cBai gongzi and this Alliance Head has an iron-clad relationship. Even if he didn\u2019t help me deal with many affairs in the Alliance Head Residence, I would still feel that it is my duty to save him. However, even if we must go save him, we can\u2019t move hastily without making any preparations. Even though the Demonic Sect isn\u2019t worth mentioning, for better or for worse, they\u2019re still experts with skill levels as high as the clouds. I still have not recovered completely from my injury. To head off alone, it would be difficult to escape from harm. At that time, being injured would be a small matter, but if it so happens that this Alliance Head isn\u2019t successful in rescuing Bai gongzi, wouldn\u2019t that cause everyone to be disappointed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the Alliance Head Command Tablet, I definitely won\u2019t hand it over to the Demonic Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>This statement once again stirred up a thousand waves in the crowd. Everyone started voicing opinions but there was no one that stepped out to interrogate her as to why. Only the person that asked the question earlier spoke again, \u201cAlliance Head\u2019s words aren\u2019t related to the topic ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>She took a brief glance at the Elder Yu, whose expression turned pretty bad the moment he heard her say that she wasn\u2019t handing the Alliance Head Command Tablet over, then gestured towards the crowd, indicating for them to listen.</p><br/><p>Only then did they gradually quiet down.</p><br/><p>They then heard her clear and straight-forward voice sounding again, \u201cEveryone, calm down first. Listen until I finish speaking before asking questions, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surroundings were completely silent as they all looked towards her, waiting to see what she was going to say.</p><br/><p>My lord, it\u2019s finally quiet! They were so loud her ears were practically ringing(symptoms of tinnitus)!</p><br/><p>Sweeping an eye over everyone, Tang Doudou cleared her throat and started to spit out all the drafts she had in her stomach section by section, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, think about it. What does the Alliance Head Command Tablet represent?\u201dT/N</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s face ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had lost and vacant expressions. What did that have to do with the situation ah? What exactly is the Alliance Head trying to convey?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t care whether they understood or not and quickly continued: \u201cThe Alliance Head Command Tablet not only represents my status as Alliance Head, it also represents everyone\u2019s face. Why? Because of its symbolic nature! Symbolic nature! Symbolic nature! The important point was said three times! You guys must remember at all costs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what is the Demonic Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn evil, dark, criminal organization!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what we represent is justice, light!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen facing the coercion of an evil criminal organization, we should resist and reject them, not accept a compromise and allow them to continue their arrogant behavior!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Alliance Head seem to be making a lot of sense!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s voice was impassioned. As she spoke, she even stepped onto a large rock at the side and looked forty-five degrees up towards the sky as she cried out in a voice ladened with grief. \u201cBut your reactions have made me very disappointed and hurt! You all want me to use everyone\u2019s face to exchange for Xiao Bai! You want me to take your face and hand it over to the Demonic Sect to trample! This is like fiercely giving my heart a stab, it hurts ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was speaking, she even lifted her hand and fiercely jabbed towards her heart. While displaying a pained expression, she slowly lowered her head and used her tear-filled emotional eyes to stare at the already stunned blank crowd.</p><br/><p>Abruptly stretching out her hand and slowly moving her five fingers in the air above the crowd, she then tightly clenched her fist and thumped it on her chest as she sung passionately, \u201cAh! Jinkela, my Jinkela\u2026\u201d*</p><br/><p>I never expected Jinkela to show up again so I didn\u2019t add it into the glossary before and had to go back through the chapters to look for it. It is now in the glossary. Jinkela is a chemical fertilizer additive brand with a strong local flavor. They invited foreign actors to shoot some ridiculous patriotic video to advertise so it ended up being mocked a lot on the internet.</p><br/><p>What is Jinkela? Based on how mournful Alliance Head looks, could it be what she described as the so-called face?</p><br/><p>This conjecture appeared at the same time in everyone\u2019s hearts. Then, they immediately saw Tang Doudou continue to say with intense passion while holding back her tears: \u201cComrades ah! We can\u2019t compromise just like this! We must resist! There would be no killing without trade!(slogan protesting killing for ivory) Rise up, let\u2019s all stand up! Friends that aren\u2019t willing to be Jinkela! Let\u2019s resist! Friends that aren\u2019t willing to be Jinkela!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us take this courageous first step!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefeat evil, overthrow the Demonic Sect! Don\u2019t give up hope, don\u2019t lose faith, don\u2019t compromise! We must let the Demonic Sect, that bunch of trash know that we, the Alliance Head Residence, aren\u2019t that easy to bully!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a clean nimble sweep, she wiped off a tear. Tang Doudou stood with her back to the light, on top of the rock. The sunlight shone from behind her back and caused her to be wrapped in a seemingly incomparably pure and holy halo-like radiance. Adding on to her righteousness-filled eyes, it was bright to the point that everyone was almost blinded. It caused a feeling of admiration to arise involuntarily within their hearts.</p><br/><p>She slowly closed her eyes again. When everyone became a little puzzled, she abruptly opened her eyes again and pointed towards the people below her and asked loudly: \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity right now to defeat the Demonic Sect. Are you guys willing to go do it? Are you willing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Usually, there would definitely be someone that would ask: Did he go crazy?</p><br/><p>Was defeating the Demonic Sect something that you can just talk about then do?</p><br/><p>But right now, everyone\u2019s passion was already aroused by her and there was a raging flame ignited in their hearts. When they heard her say this, some unknown person in the crowd couldn\u2019t hold back and replied loudly, \u201cWilling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, people started reacting one after another and also shouted, \u201cAlliance Head, we\u2019re willing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re willing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The momentum built. Each subsequent wave was stronger than the previous wave, vibrating through the entire Alliance Head Residence to the point that the residence was close to collapsing.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s head poked out to look over that elevated high white wall between the Alliance Head Residence and Plum Garden. Feeling this unusually energetic clamor, his gaze was exceptionally pleased as he looked towards Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>This yatou isn\u2019t bad. By tugging towards the east and pulling towards the west a little, she was able to cause Elder Yu, that old bastard, to be completely confused and to no longer know where is the north, south, east, west.</p><br/><p>He had even worried that she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it and ran over here to wait and see if he could help.</p><br/><p>But from the looks of it, that was unnecessary.</p><br/><p>As he thought so, he decided to just leap up onto the wall, and then laid down sideways, propping his head up with one hand. He watched as Tang Doudou waved her hand downwards again and again. Within her dignified voice, he could clearly hear the hints of a soft and cute intonation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, everyone, calm down!\u201d Tang Doudou spoke as such.</p><br/><p>However, everyone was currently uncontrollably stirred up, how could they calm down?</p><br/><p>It must be known that the situation of the Demonic Sect oppressing the small forces within the martial arts circles wasn\u2019t something that had lasted for just one or two days. Yet simply because they were all apprehensive of Mu Ye\u2019s unpredictable martial arts and that bunch of strange subordinates, the Alliance Head Residence and the several large powers of the Jianghu didn\u2019t dare to act blindly without thinking. On top of that, because of the falling out between the Alliance Head and Cloud City, everyone turned to minding their own safety first. This allowed the Demonic Sect to gradually grow, to such an extent as to be as unbridledly aggressive as they were today.</p><br/><p>When their thoughts got to this point, there were people that turned to look towards Elder Yu with blameful expressions.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu was completely dumbstruck. He completely wrecked his brain to think through it, but still couldn\u2019t figure out Tang Doudou\u2019s true intentions. At this moment, his thoughts were still stuck on the fact that Tang Doudou mentioned Madam Yu and didn\u2019t hear much of what Tang Doudou said after that. When he finally returned to his senses and saw that there were some not very friendly gazes directed towards him, he became even more confused.</p><br/><p>But right now if he didn\u2019t say anything, everyone would be lead off by the nose by Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>When he glanced backwards, those in the same alliance as him currently had stars in their eyes as they looked towards Tang Doudou with incomparable adoration. Upon seeing this, Elder Yu felt a burst of anger. This bunch of useless trash!</p><br/><p>But even after thinking, he still didn\u2019t know what to say because he didn\u2019t pay attention to what Tang Doudou said earlier. All he heard was that last sentence, are you willing? And faintly something about some opportunity.</p><br/><p>After a little bit of deliberation, Elder Yu saw that everyone had almost quieted down under Tang Doudou\u2019s beckoning and hurriedly took advantage of the opportunity to ask: \u201cAlliance Head, lao fu(basically \u2018this old man\u2019, used by men over 70 that are respected) still doesn\u2019t quite understand. What kind of opportunity is it exactly ah? Why don\u2019t we know anything about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t look at him. She had been keeping an eye on the old bastard the entire time earlier, and knew that he didn\u2019t hear what that bunch of words she said earlier was about at all. She sneered in her heart. Old bastard, wait and see how this great auntie will sort you out!</p><br/><p>Before she came, she was just thinking of finding some people to go rescue Bai Feiyun. But after hearing about how Elder Yu was henpecked from Li Hong, she got a faint feeling that perhaps this was an opportunity, a good opportunity to defeat Elder Yu.</p><br/><p>Of course, if Elder Yu behaved and stayed honest rather than provoked her, she definitely wouldn\u2019t go to this pain-in-the-ass length to defeat him. But Elder Yu simply had to provoke her. Not only did he want to get her Alliance Head Command Tablet, he even collaborated with the Demonic Sect and kidnapped Bai Feiyun!</p><br/><p>Uncle could endure but Auntie can\u2019t endure!T/N</p><br/><p>Damned freak, I spit! She, Tang Doudou, definitely won\u2019t let that old bastard go just like this!</p><br/><p>Moreover, this was a seized opportunity. If she didn\u2019t use it properly, wouldn\u2019t that make her look stupid?</p><br/><p>Slightly narrowing her eyes and exposing the craftiness of a little fox, Tang Doudou lifted her middle finger towards Elder Yu as she praised ruthlessly: \u201cElder Yu\u2019s question is good, is well, is hella dang swell!\u201dT/N3</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

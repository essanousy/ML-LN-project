The scene outside was already faintly visible. Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but peek at Lan Jia. When she saw that he seemed completely calm, she became even more puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady, we\u2019re out,\u201d said Lan Jia as he turned to look at her.</p><br/><p>Due to the fact that Tang Doudou had been staring at Lan Jia, she was surprised when he suddenly looked over and tripped over a rock.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia moved extremely fast. An arm that was smooth as jade came out of his black robe and passed through her hair. His warm palm swept past her cheek as he caught her head and her waist. His gentle gaze contained faint concern. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou came back to her senses but couldn\u2019t look at his eyes. A strange feeling was emerging in her. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia helped her up. Due to the fact that they were very close together, Tang Doudou could smell a faint, sandalwood scent coming from him. It was light and mild, just like his eyes. For some unknown reason, it caused people to have a favorable impression of him.</p><br/><p>Ever since she had encountered him, she had felt as if something was trying to emerge in her brain.</p><br/><p>Could it be that she knew this person?</p><br/><p>Or was it that Li Xueyi knew him?</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether she knew him or not, it was still best to stay as far away from the members of the Seven Great Saint Tribes as possible!</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for seeing me out. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll be taking my leave!\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t want to stay together with Lan Jia for even a minute longer. Although he seemed like a good person, she kept having a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she still had to figure out a way to meet up with Baili Yu again.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia once again said \u2018not at all,\u2019 then turned and walked back into the forest.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s brows furrowed when she saw him walk away without hesitation. Could it be that she had been overthinking things? Lan Jia really was just helping her out of the goodness of his heart?</p><br/><p>Well, it didn\u2019t matter!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced around. Near the forest was a river and there was a hill on the opposite shore. The hill wasn\u2019t very tall and there seemed to be a bit of smoke rising, so there was probably a village over there.</p><br/><p>She glanced at the forest behind her again. She didn\u2019t know if Baili Yu had made it out yet.</p><br/><p>However, it was clear that she couldn\u2019t wait for him outside the forest. Since this was the forbidden grounds of the Seven Great Saint Tribes, there were definitely a lot of black-clothed men. She had better get to the opposite shore first before making any more plans!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was just about to leave when the leaves behind her rustled again.</p><br/><p>After the incident with the monkey, Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t as afraid anymore and she turned around slowly. However, she still didn\u2019t see anything.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the monkey from earlier has come back after seeing that Lan Jia left?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle monkey? Lil\u2019 Gray?\u201d Tang Doudou actually quite liked that monkey. It didn\u2019t seem to have an owner, so it\u2019d be nice to have it as a companion.</p><br/><p>She called a couple times but that monkey didn\u2019t show up, so she could only drop it. It seemed they weren\u2019t fated to be. She turned and was about to leave.</p><br/><p>However, she spotted another person standing not far from her.</p><br/><p>This time, she wasn\u2019t frightened and instead reacted with pleasant surprise. \u201cMu Ye!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was actually Mu Ye!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Tang Doudou started running over, but stopped halfway. She recalled the hallucination that Qing Moran\u2019s guqin caused. \u201cY-you\u2019re Mu Ye, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d It was a short and cold reply. It really was him.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately rushed over with a happy smile. \u201cIt really is you! Why are you also here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was happy to see that Mu Ye seemed completely fine, but when she got close, she couldn\u2019t help but act a bit reserved. She didn\u2019t know what to say, especially when she recalled what that fake Mu Ye was like.</p><br/><p>When Mu Ye saw her, although he was cold as unusual, his gaze became conspicuously gentler. \u201cI have business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you the one that caused the disturbance in the forest earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin, then looked towards the other side of the river. \u201cThen did you come from that side?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was just about to ask another question when she heard him say, \u201cI saw Baili Yu earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Where is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe left with others. This place isn\u2019t safe, so come with me.\u201d Mu Ye lowered his head to glance at her. When he saw the fruits she was hugging, he asked, \u201cSpirit fruit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Baili Yu said that these were tasty so I picked some extra. Do you want to try some?\u201d asked Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s gaze flickered for a brief instant. \u201cEn, no need.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, he started walking towards the river.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou followed after him. The rush of delight from seeing him again gradually faded and she became curious again. Was Mu Ye\u2019s so-called \u2018business\u2019 pointing to finding Shen Moru for revenge? Or was it to investigate the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you guys come here?\u201d asked Mu Ye as he glanced back at her.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

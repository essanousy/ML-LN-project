She looked like she had been through a lot!</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Just as this question emerged in everyone\u2019s thoughts, a burst of mad laughter came from Tang Doudou\u2019s mouth. Everyone became very confused. Could it be that someone had beaten her silly after she headed out?</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai ah, Xiao Bai. Hurry and come over here. Come help me take a look!\u201d Before the laughter even stopped, Tang Doudou rushed in. She looked at the people in the courtyard who were staring at her with strange expressions, then ran straight to Bai Feiyun and extended her wrist which was rather clean compared to her face.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun glanced at her. He didn\u2019t listen to her and check her pulse, instead, he asked, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy, let\u2019s not worry about that for now. I\u2019ll tell you after you help me take a look!\u201d Tang Doudou felt very impatient. If the heart of the Black Demonic Nightcrawler could cure the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, then Mu Ye had hope!</p><br/><p>At that time, he could cure the poison even without her help, so he wouldn\u2019t come disturb her anymore.</p><br/><p>This matter that was taxing in spirit and body could be resolved beautifully.</p><br/><p>Thinking to here, Tang Doudou became even more impatient. She itched to just ask Bai Feiyun straight out to check if the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance was gone, but she was also worried about the people currently present in the courtyard. Everyone felt bad looking at her expression which seemed to be suppressing an urgent desire.</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao said, \u201cBai gongzi, you should just help Alliance Head Li take a look first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Alliance Head looks quite anxious. Bai gongzi should take a look first. It would be terrible if he had been poisoned!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since everyone was persuading him, Bai Feiyun could only agree. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he turned and headed towards the inner courtyard. Tang Doudou wiggled her butt and followed.</p><br/><p>Inside the courtyard, magnolia flower petals drifted over from the neighboring Bai Courtyard. The fluttering flow was exceptionally pretty. Bai Feiyun walked in front, his white garments pure, his black hair shifting slightly\u2026 Tang Doudou felt slightly dizzy as she looked. She seemed to see Bai Feiyun\u2019s body multiplying, from one body to two, two to three\u2026</p><br/><p>Something was off ah!</p><br/><p>Was something wrong with her eyes?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou blinked her eyes, yet everywhere she looked, there was a Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou blinked hard, but still saw Bai Feiyuns everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d She fell to the ground in fear. \u201cXiao Bai!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that terrified voice, Bai Feiyun hastily turned around and found that Tang Doudou was covering her eyes, seemingly in pain.</p><br/><p>It seemed that something had happened!</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Bai Feiyun strode over to help Tang Doudou to the room.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the moment Tang Doudou looked up and saw him, she abruptly pushed him away, crying, \u201cN-no! Stay away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s gaze turned serious. What was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cXueyi, it\u2019s me, Xiao Bai. What\u2019s wrong? Come over here, I\u2019ll help you take a look, alright?\u201d Bai Feiyun softened his tone until it was extremely gentle. At the same time, he slowly reached towards Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Everything seemed normal to Bai Feiyun, but what Tang Doudou saw were hands extending towards her from all around. There were even countless faces, eyes, noses, and mouths\u2026 It was extremely terrifying!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away! Stay away!\u201d Bai Feiyun\u2019s hand was just about to touch Tang Doudou when she suddenly flailed her arms as if she saw something frightening and tried to keep Bai Feiyun away.</p><br/><p>Finally realizing that the situation was serious, Bai Feiyun lifted a needle. He planned to use this to control Tang Doudou and make her calm down.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, right after the needle left his hand it was hit away by Tang Doudou\u2019s inner strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cXueyi!\u201d The needle fell to the ground. Bai Feiyun was also pushed back several steps by the shockwave. After he regained his balance, he looked at Tang Doudou with shock. When had her inner strength become so strong?</p><br/><p>He had already noticed when he checked her pulse last time that her inner strength was slowly growing. It seemed that her inner strength would increase a little every time a bit of the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance disappeared. However, this increase was not a good thing. If the dantian was compared to a container, it meant that the amount of inner strength it could contain was limited. If this limit was exceeded, the dantain would shatter and the person\u2019s veins would rupture. If it wasn\u2019t severe, it would cause an injury. If it was severe, it could mean death!</p><br/><p>This current situation in which her inner strength was going out of control was due to her inner strength skyrocketing and causing her to be delirious.</p><br/><p>He definitely could not subdue Tang Doudou on his own. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t allow too many people to find out. His gaze landed on the wall of Bai Courtyard.</p><br/><p>Leaping onto the wall, he just happened to see Yu Fenger and Jin Longbiao snuggling together and talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Wind Jade Dew!\u201d Bai Feiyun kept his attention on Tang Doudou who was inside the Alliance Head Residence courtyard. A needle had already been sent flying towards Golden Wind Jade Dew.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger dodged the needle and stood up with Jin Longbiao. When he saw that it was Bai Feiyun standing on the wall, he exposed a puzzled expression. \u201cBai gongzi, what do you mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething has happened to Xueyi. Come over and help me stop him!\u201d Right after Bai Feiyun finished speaking, he saw that Tang Doudou was spinning around in place violently, before she started running outwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s running. I\u2019m going to follow him. You guys hurry and come as well!\u201d After saying this hastily, Bai Feiyun leapt off the wall and chased after Tang Doudou who had practically become a ray of light.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

One good thing about this world was that those damned monitoring and tapping devices didn\u2019t exist. Hence, as long as there wasn\u2019t anyone around and you discussed things quietly, no one would be able to listen in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much for now. Come over here, I\u2019ll explain\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou started nattering next to Ye Chuan\u2019s ear. The more Ye Chuan listened, the more excited his expression became. From time to time, he would look towards Tang Doudou with admiration in his eyes. His behavior also gradually became as strange as Tang Doudou\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou patted her chest. \u201cYou must trust me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn regards to trust, I actually do trust you but this, this\u2026\u201d Ye Chuan thought about what Tang Doudou asked of him earlier and lifted his hand again. However, in the end he dropped it. \u201cI can\u2019t bring myself to do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you bring yourself to do it? A great man has to be ruthless, quit dawdling like a lady!\u201d urged Tang Doudou. \u201cHurry up ah, are you a man or not?\u201dT/N Ye Chuan looked at his palm, then thought about his master. Hardening his heart and gritting his teeth, he lifted his hand and sent a vicious slap towards Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Just as his hand was about to reach Tang Doudou\u2019s face, all the force in his hand suddenly disappeared and his hand landed on her face as lightly as a feather .</p><br/><p>This sensation not only did not hurt, it didn\u2019t even tickle! Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes rolled back from her speechlessness.</p><br/><p>Looks like she\u2019ll have to step up after all for this crucial moment!</p><br/><p>Speaking is slow, time is fast.G Just after Ye Chuan finished giving his feather-like slap and was about to retrieve his hand in embarrassment, he heard Tang Doudou\u2019s miserable shriek. Then she flew out in the direction he had slapped in and fell heavily onto the ground. Rolling about while covering her face, she cried, \u201cAiyah, owww, owww! I\u2019m going to die from the pain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026isn\u2019t that a little over-exaggerated?</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan retrieved his hand and stared dumbstruck at Tang Doudou who was rolling all over the ground.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s acting was seriously too realistic. It was to the point that it made him feel like he had actually hit her fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHell, what are you still spacing out over there for? Continue kicking me!\u201d Tang Doudou opened her fingers to reveal her eyes and blinked towards Ye Chuan through the cracks between her fingers.</p><br/><p>This was part of the plan they had discussed earlier. Ye Chuan nodded to indicate his understanding.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The person behind everything had probably shown himself so he went to follow. However, at his level of martial arts, he definitely won\u2019t be able to deal with that person. Yiling, take this and get in touch with the people of Wind Shadow and have them assist Ah Xin. You should go as well. Ah Xin tends to miss details, so help him keep an eye on that person. Remember, don\u2019t make any rash moves. Pass this message onto him as well. He\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Baili Yu untied a jade whistle and passed it to her. \u201cAfter you blow it, people of Wind Shadow will get in touch with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Shadow?\u201d Baili Yiling accepted the whistle. \u201cIs it Feng Long and the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu looked at her. \u201cEn, they are Feng Long\u2019s subordinates, but she\u2019s currently keeping an eye on Yun Hai in Huai City right now, so I\u2019m handing these troops over to you for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling nodded. \u201cAlright! Yiling definitely won\u2019t disappoint you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to take on such a heavy responsibility. Just be careful and stay safe, got it?\u201d exhorted Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t go into Baili Yiling\u2019s ears at all. She had been wanting to help her brother out. Now that she finally had a chance, she had to get it done perfectly! If not, how could she come back to face him?</p><br/><p>She left energetically, but Baili Yu didn\u2019t worry much. Although this little sister of his wanted to prove herself a little too much, she was still pretty clever.</p><br/><p>Both she and Jun Xin weren\u2019t people that were easy to deal with. If something happened to them even though they were only shadowing the person, then that person\u2019s strength was definitely beyond his expectations.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu then turned to look towards Tang Doudou again. He gently took her hand and said softly, \u201cDoudou, don\u2019t be scared. This husband won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t hear anything right now, but she was still conscious and could feel the situation in her body. She knew that she was on the brink of death and was very scared, but she didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>She wanted to cry out and find someone to help her, but no longer how she struggled, it felt like something was blocking her throat so she couldn\u2019t make any noise. Her eyelids also wouldn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>What exactly was going on? How did this suddenly happen?</p><br/><p>Did it have something to do with that ant bite? Was Bai Feiyun the one that did this to her? Why did he do that? Could it be that he actually hated her this much?</p><br/><p>He hated her to the point that he wouldn\u2019t let off even an innocent child?</p><br/><p>When the thought that she might lose the child occurred to her, that last bit of relunctance to hurt Bai Feiyun disappeared from her heart. Since he\u2019s already decided to become so ruthless towards her, she would no longer hold onto that past friendship either or the times that he had treated her well. The next time they met again, there would be nothing left but hatred!</p><br/><p>Child\u2026</p><br/><p>Her thoughts came back to this point and she felt uncontrollable fear. Her heart clenched in unspeakable pain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

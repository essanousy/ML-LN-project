Suddenly, a far-fetched thought occurred to her. Her lips moved slightly and she suddenly shouted, \u201cCang Baicao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Yu didn\u2019t react. After quite a while, he said, \u201cHow did you know that Cang Baicao is the only one that can cure you two?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looks like it wasn\u2019t him ah!</p><br/><p>Was she overthinking things?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not right. Her intuition had always been very accurate. This Doctor Yu was definitely not a simple character!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost done dealing with the injuries. Are you still not going to come out? Just as I\u2019ve said, your facial color is terrible. It\u2019s probably due to being pressed down, right?\u201d said Doctor Yu with a wink.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re the freaking one that\u2019s being pressed down! Your entire family is being pressed down!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. She didn\u2019t plan on paying any more attention to him but Doctor Yu insisted on continuing to chat with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle yatou, someone has helped you treat this poison before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person that treated the poison was Cang Baicao, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou ignored him. Why didn\u2019t she notice earlier that this old guy was so talkative?</p><br/><p>\u201cCang Baicao is a godly doctor ah. Those medical skills are the greatest in the world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as he continues helping you treat the poison, it\u2019s not impossible that the poison can be completely cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter all, that person is a godly doctor ah!\u201d said Doctor Yu with an emotional sigh.</p><br/><p>This time Tang Doudou heard the grossness in the words clearly. This freaking guy is definitely Cang Baicao! And he was even praising himself so shamelessly, he sure has some thick skin on his old face!</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit pretending, I know it\u2019s you! Cang Baicao, why did you disguise yourself as a doctor and run all the way here instead of staying properly in Azure Water Valley?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Doctor Yu stopped acting. Patting her arm, he said, \u201cBaili Yu would be done for if I didn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Baili Yu died, wouldn\u2019t you die from heartache?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Doctor Yu sighed as if he felt grieved as well. \u201cIn the past, you were always saying that you hated Baili Yu that sissy the most, and that he has such deep schemes he was like a fox. Yet now, you want to become his bride. Truly, aren\u2019t the matters of the world so fickle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey stinkin\u2019 old man, can you stop making things up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh, what? Unhappy because I hit the mark?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit wasting time. Hurry up and save the person, alright?\u201d Tang Doudou turned her head away but ended up seeing Baili Yu\u2019s face. Her heart felt uncomfortable so she hastily turned back around. Unexpectedly, what filled her vision this time was Doctor Yu\u2019s approaching head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYatou, you should be careful. Baili Yu isn\u2019t someone a person can afford to provoke!\u201d exhorted Doctor Yu.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t want to provoke this evil spirit either ah. But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that you could cure the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance?\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way she\u2019d stay by Baili Yu\u2019s side once the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance was cured. These last few days almost drove her crazy!</p><br/><p>Not to mention, she believed that those strange feelings that she had been experiencing were due to the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance. What else would cause such abnormalities?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked towards Cang Baicao with eyes full of hope. However, Cang Baicao shook his head in a helpless manner. \u201cHow could it possibly be that easy? The only one that can cure that poison is Baili Yu. However, though he was able to cure himself of the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, he wasn\u2019t able to cure his Hoarfrost Poison. It\u2019s simply cause and effect!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoarfrost Poison?\u201d asked Tang Doudou. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that Baili Yu\u2019s old illness is a poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s a poison!\u201d said Cang Baicao confidently. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s capable of undoing this type of poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are always saying that you can cure this poison and that poison, so why don\u2019t you just f-ing cure it before boasting? This Disseminating Tassel Fragrance of mine is like a time bomb that can claim my little life at any time, don\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Right now, the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance no longer poses much threat to your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!?\u201d Tang Doudou looked towards Cang Baicao in pleasant surprise. In her excitement, she had pushed Baili Yu out of the way. After sitting up, she noticed that Baili Yu\u2019s brows were knitted in discomfort so she hastily set Baili Yu down carefully before jumping off the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that my Disseminating Tassel Fragrance will no longer kill me? Then does that mean I don\u2019t need Baili Yu to help me cure my poison anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao exposed an amiable smile in response to Tang Doudou\u2019s hope-filled gaze. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, it doesn\u2019t pose any threat to your life right now. I didn\u2019t say that this would continue to be so.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck! Your damned great uncle!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sent a kick towards Cang Baicao\u2019s thigh. \u201cStinkin\u2019 old man, this lady hasn\u2019t even settled the past debt of how you hung me up last time! Yet you dare to tease me? See how I\u2019ll sort you out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though aged, Cang Baicao was still extremely nimble. He jumped to the side, dodging Tang Doudou\u2019s kick, then warned her, \u201cYatou, you better treat me more politely. Otherwise, I won\u2019t help with saving Baili Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to save him, then just don\u2019t! Whether he lives or dies has nothing to do with me!\u201d Tang Doudou rushed over again. She could not swallow this anger! She must beat up this stinkin\u2019 old man!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that said it!\u201d Cang Baicao huffed, causing the mustache at the sides of his lips to lift. This damned yatou really doesn\u2019t know how to recognize the good intentions of others. If it weren\u2019t for the instructions from the City Lord, there was no way he would have come to save Baili Yu. He would have celebrated if Baili Yu died!</p><br/><p>Because of Baili Yu, his Azure Water Valley had been snatched away!</p><br/><p>The saddest part was that his precious medicinal field, which he had looked after carefully for so many years, had been destroyed by those bastards from God Firmament Hall. Those herbs were drops of blood from his heart ah!</p><br/><p>And all of this was Baili Yu\u2019s fault!</p><br/><p>Instead of staying properly within his Plum Garden, he insisted on running all the way here and bringing so much trouble. It\u2019s so hateful.</p><br/><p>However, now that Azure Water Valley was gone\u2026 That Plum Garden was also a very good place\u2026</p><br/><p>Baili Yu wasn\u2019t aware that while he was unconscious, someone had set their sights on his Plum Garden!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

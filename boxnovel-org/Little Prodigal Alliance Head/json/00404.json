However, I do have a drug called oblivion\u2026\u201d (Makes you forget about the person you love/erases your feelings, I think.)</p><br/><p>\u201cOblivion?\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s expression finally changed and gradually turned dark. \u201cWhy would you possess that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for Baili gongzi to know. Baili gongzi only needs to say whether you agree or not!\u201d Bai Feiyun\u2019s tone remain unchanged.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but wonder what oblivion was.</p><br/><p>Why did Baili Yu react so seriously when he heard about this?</p><br/><p>She heaved a long sigh. From the looks of things, Bai Feiyun had gotten the advantage this time.</p><br/><p>Although he had said that he wouldn\u2019t hurt her, she knew that if Baili Yu refused to hand the person over, he would definitely kill her.</p><br/><p>When her thoughts got to this point, she couldn\u2019t help but feel sad. Why was a person\u2019s heart so complicated. Everything he did for her in the past seemed to be sincere, so why did his attitude completely change in the blink of an eye?</p><br/><p>The hardest thing in the world to understand was a person\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>She finally understood the meaning of this sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d said Baili Yu. He moved his foot off that person and started walking over.</p><br/><p>The moment he moved, the masters of the four families walked towards the mysterious person.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t go back on his word. After Baili Yu handed over the person, he released Tang Doudou. However, just as Tang Doudou was feeling that it was strange he had released her so easily, she felt pain on the back of her nape like an ant had bit her. She reflexively reached back to feel but didn\u2019t find anything.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was walking towards her and she hadn\u2019t found anything wrong with her neck, so she walked up without thinking about it much. However, when she reached Baili Yu, her eyes blurred and she couldn\u2019t see him clearly. She rubbed her eyes, but her vision wouldn\u2019t clear up.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu noticed that something was off with her and hastily caught her. \u201cDoudou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou could faintly hear someone calling her name, but it seemed to come from very far away. She couldn\u2019t tell who it was at all.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling finally ran over. When she saw that Tang Doudou looked strange, she grabbed Tang Doudou\u2019s wrist to check her pulse. Her expression changed drastically and she cried out in alarm. \u201cBig Brother! Sister-in-Law has gotten poisoned! The child, the child can\u2019t be saved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d The moment Baili Yu heard this, his face also turned as pale as paper. He immediately lifted Tang Doudou and started shouting, \u201cQing Yu, Qing He, come out! Ye Chuan, go find Cang Baicao. Quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>The chrysanthemum glass jade palanquin seemed to instantly appear. Baili Yu rushed straight into the palanquin, then the maids lifted the carriage and disappeared just as suddenly as they had arrived. The large group of hidden guards dressed in black in the distance also vanished.</p><br/><p>Of course, they took Baili Yiling as well.</p><br/><p>Everyone was too stunned to take in everything that had just happened. By the time they came back to their senses, everything was gone as if it had never happened.</p><br/><p>Some people were quietly discussing these things. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that Alliance Head was pregnant? She came to help us catch the mysterious person even though she was pregnant, that\u2019s really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly was it that poisoned her? How could he do something like that to a pregnant woman? He seriously has no conscience!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi seemed to be the only one with Alliance Head just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch your words, how could it be Bai gongzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, there\u2019s no way it can be Bai gongzi. It must be someone else. It might be that mysterious person\u2019s companion. Since he can conceal himself, his companions probably can too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWonder if Alliance Head will be able to make it back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As everyone was discussing this, Bai Feiyun had already made his way over to stand with the heads of the four families. Elder Yu and the others had also walked over with him. They glanced worriedly towards the direction Baili Yu had left in. They hadn\u2019t expected that Tang Doudou had come to help them even though she was pregnant.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder she had said that she was recuperating in Azure Water Valley. It was no wonder why she hadn\u2019t come out even though they had waited for so long.</p><br/><p>Now that they thought about it, they had probably misunderstood her a lot.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was the only who didn\u2019t seem concerned. He walked to the mysterious person and reached out. His voice was slightly dark as he said, \u201cLet\u2019s see who exactly you are that you were able to make Baili Yu rush back here from so far away to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he concealed that darkness very deeply so his voice sounded mild as usual to everyone. Still, they found his words strange.</p><br/><p>How come Bai Feiyun knew that Baili Yu had rushed back from far away? And that it had been to save this person?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu had just broken this person\u2019s meridians! How did that resemble saving in this slightest?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

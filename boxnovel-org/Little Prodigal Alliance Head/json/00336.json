The bursts of cool wind allowed them to be a lot more comfortable than the rest of the people.</p><br/><p>However, it also attracted a lot of looks.</p><br/><p>Several guards started heading towards them. The first thing that annoyed them was that they were all enduring this silently, but she was sitting comfortably on a carriage and fanning herself. What was with this?</p><br/><p>In addition, they were currently looking for a person and this carriage looked like it could hide a person easily!</p><br/><p>When they got to the carriage, a guard slapped the side of the carriage and said in an unfriendly tone, \u201cGet off, we\u2019re inspecting this!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was much more comfortable inside the carriage. Who knew how hot the ground was?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled humbly. \u201cSirs, we\u2019re good people that follow the law. The only person inside my carriage is my wife. If you guys aren\u2019t assured, you guys can go in to search. However, my wife\u2019s condition is inconvenient, so is it alright if she stays on the carriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>That guard refused to yield. \u201cWho cares if you\u2019re a good or a bad person? You can only pass after this big master checks your carriage. And what do you mean her condition is inconvenient? You\u2019d better not tell me that at your age, she\u2019s actually pregnant with a baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s hand paused. This person\u2019s way of speaking really called for a beating!</p><br/><p>Baili Yu pretended to support her in order to stop her from being angry. He said with a smile, \u201cSir truly has sharp eyes. My wife is indeed pregnant, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! Who would believe you? What if it\u2019s just an excuse to stop us from searching the carriage properly so that a criminal can get through?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard\u2019s words were seriously heartless. Everyone around started talking about it. A particular elderly grannie with a strong voice said, \u201cThat woman\u2019s steps are weak and her face is flushed, so she probably is pregnant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! So what if they\u2019re old? In our neighboring village, that Master Liu who practically has one foot in his grave managed to impregnate his newly taken little wife!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Liu\u2019s wife? Master Liu is already eighty! He was still able to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kid probably isn\u2019t Master Liu\u2019s, you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys shouldn\u2019t say nonsense. The baby\u2019s already been born and gone through the blood drop test. He really is Master Liu\u2019s son!\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation was getting further and further off topic, but Tang Doudou really wanted to correct these people and tell them that the method of using a drop of blood to verify blood bonds wasn\u2019t reliable!</p><br/><p>For an eighty-year-old to get a son, it\u2019s ninety-nine percent not his.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know so much about it? Could it be that you\u2019ve seen it with your own eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>That grannie smiled in delight. \u201cI was the midwife that helped deliver that baby. What does seeing count? I personally delivered it! I even performed the blood drop test. I was the one that squeezed that drop of blood out from that little young master\u2019s finger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that you\u2019re Grandma Wang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me, that\u2019s me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, Grandma Wang, we truly have fate to encounter each other at such a place. You know, I have a wife and she\u2019s almost about to give birth, can you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFate is fate, but rules are rules. You should know my rules\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When the guard saw that some of the people were starting to talk business, he shouted, \u201cWhat are you doing? Do you want to enter the city or not? If you do, shut up and behave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandma Wang pursed her lips unhappily and muttered, \u201cWhat are you yelling for? I\u2019m here to deliver the baby of County Magistrate Wu\u2019s little wife. If you delay things and County Magistrate Wu gets angry, I\u2019d like to see how you guys can explain yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment those guards heard this, their expressions rapidly changed. Everyone knew that the county magistrate\u2019s wife was close to giving birth and that the county magistrate loved his wife a lot. If they didn\u2019t let the people past and ended up causing trouble for the delivery of the child, all of them would probably lose their jobs.</p><br/><p>The originally arrogant guard immediately asked Grandma Wang to step out of the line respectfully. \u201cGrandma Wang, why didn\u2019t you say this earlier? If you stay in line like this, you\u2019ll definitely be late. Aren\u2019t you harming us like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis grandma! Doesn\u2019t want to be treated special, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand!\u201d The guard hastily nodded. \u201cBut this is related to a person\u2019s life, and human life is beyond value, so it should be handled specially. Grandma Wang, I feel like there\u2019s no need to inspect you. Hurry and enter the city to help Second Madam!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandma Wang laughed. \u201cAiy, even though it\u2019s related to a person\u2019s life, what\u2019s necessary shouldn\u2019t be neglected, lest others say that I\u2019m making use of my connections. These are my midwifery tools, so inspect them carefully. Once you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll enter the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, it was good for them that she had allowed them to inspect her possessions. The task this time was very important, to the point that they could lose their heads if they weren\u2019t careful.</p><br/><p>The guard got someone to check through Grandma Wang\u2019s bag, then they packed it back up carefully and handed it back to her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary. Grandma Wang, please enter the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Baili Yu shared a look. It was the first time they had seen soldiers treat a midwife so respectfully. In the past, they hadn\u2019t even heard of such a thing.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu said in a low voice, \u201cShe\u2019s probably a very good midwife. Once we enter the city, let\u2019s ask around about her. If she really is skilled, let\u2019s invite her back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInvite her back for what?\u201d Tang Doudou was baffled.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu coughed. \u201cIn preparation, just preparation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was speechless. There was no even a trace of pregnancy yet and he was already inviting a midwife back in preparation? Had he gone crazy from his desire for kids?</p><br/><p>She rolled her eyes at him, then continued watching Grandma Wang.</p><br/><p>That guard walked Grandma Wang to the city gates like she was his own mother. When Tang Doudou saw this, she wondered if perhaps Grandma Wang truly was skilled.</p><br/><p>As she was thinking this, that Grandma Wang stopped walking and said to the guard, \u201cThat little lady is probably already three to four months pregnant. It\u2019s just that her health is too poor, so it isn\u2019t evident.\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard was confused. \u201cGrandma Wang, what do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman life is beyond value ah!\u201d After saying that, Grandma Wang walked into the city.</p><br/><p>However, Baili Yu\u2019s eyes turned fervent. He must have this Grandma Wang!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, that guard and Tang Doudou seemed completely confused. It was only after someone urged for the check to go faster that the guard walked back over.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

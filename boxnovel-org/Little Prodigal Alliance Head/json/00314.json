If I took a wife, I\u2019d definitely take care of my wife and stay at home to support the family. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d keep wandering outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never would\u2019ve thought that despite Brother Tang\u2019s unrestrained temperament, you were actually someone this romantic. The lady that catches Brother Tang\u2019s heart will be very blessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled slightly. This Lin Shuxuan really was a social flower. No matter what she said, he had a way to continue the conversation naturally.</p><br/><p>During this time, several new couples had already successfully formed. As Tang Doudou watched those men smiled with foolish grins on their faces as they hugged the embroidered balls, she started feeling vexed. If things went on like this, how long would it take for her to finally find Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Brother Tang, speaking of strange occurrences in Hibiscus Garrison, I recalled another strange thing. Is Brother Tang interested in hearing it?\u201d Lin Shuxuan was facing the tall stage but he had been keeping an eye on Tang Doudou\u2019s expression this entire time. When he saw her vexed expression, he immediately tried to find a new and interesting topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cA strange thing? It couldn\u2019t be that someone saw a ghost, right?\u201d Tang Doudou suppressed her feeling of frustration and responded with a smile.</p><br/><p>When Lin Shuxuan saw that she seemed interested, he smiled as well. \u201cAlthough no one saw a ghost, the rumors were similar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Then please tell me in detail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo three months ago\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou heard that it took place three months ago, her heart leapt and she nervously picked up the cup to take a sip before asking, \u201cWas it something that happened three months earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, it was about three months ago. For some reason, someone\u2019s wrist was slit in the middle of the night. Apparently, the person it was done to said that he hadn\u2019t felt anything. It wasn\u2019t until he woke up in the morning that he found out there was a wound on his wrist and that the blood had been stopped with an extremely high quality hemostatic.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Tang, don\u2019t you agree that this matter is strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said, \u201cIt\u2019s very likely that it was a person doing it though? If it was a person, then there\u2019s nothing strange about it. There are plenty of unorthodox practitioners on the Jianghu. They were probably collecting the blood to cultivate some dark technique. It\u2019s fortunate that this person seems to have some conscience and took the trouble to stop the bleeding after collecting the blood. I heard that there were a lot of people who were so crazy as to suck a person completely dry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, Brother Tang, if that were really the case, why would I bring this incident up?\u201d Lin Shuxuan tapped his fan on his palm in a mysterious way.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. After that person woke up and saw that his injury had already stopped bleeding, he stopped worrying about it. However, the next day, there was another injury right next to that first injury\u2026 This repeated for several dozen days until that person\u2019s body was filled with wounds and he had no more blood in his body!\u201d Lin Shuxuan chuckled. \u201cHow\u2019s that? Strange enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was strange. Tang Doudou remarked in surprise, \u201cSo that person wasn\u2019t doing it out of good intentions. He had planned from the very start to keep getting fresh blood from that man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very likely. I heard the government\u2019s coroner say that those cuts were very precise and seemed to have been made by an experienced person.\u201d Lin Shuxuan then shuddered. \u201cMore importantly, after that first case, County Magistrate Tao sent people to protect the most likely second victim, but the result still turned out the same. No matter how many people guarded the person, he still ended up dying from being bled dry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person that did this was definitely very skilled,\u201d said Tang Doudou. \u201cIs it still happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is also a strange part. At the start, it had happened frequently, but lately the occurrences have decreased. It\u2019s probably because that dark art has been complete!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two continued to converse like this for half the day. Tang Doudou managed to faintly get some clues. She didn\u2019t dare to be too obvious in her goal so whenever they broached the subject, she would take the initiative to soon direct the conversation to another topic in order to avoid arousing Lin Shuxuan\u2019s suspicions.</p><br/><p>As time passed, Tang Doudou saw that they didn\u2019t show any intentions of going down to fight over the embroidered balls and were only here to watch the show. Soon, she started getting drowsy. Just as her eyelids were about to close, she vaguely saw a person\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t very clear, she instantly recognized that figure and abruptly stood up to jump off the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-brother\u2026 Tang\u2026\u201d Lin Shuxuan, who had still been chattering nonstop, only saw a blur before Tang Doudou disappeared from sight. His jaw dropped. There was no way Tang Longbiao only learned \u2018a little martial arts,\u2019 just this qinggong was already on a godly level!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jun, this Tang Longbiao is probably not that simple!\u201d The men behind him finally reacted and started discussing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, of course I know that he\u2019s not simple. Since he\u2019s also probing us, let\u2019s just see who slips up first! All of you, be careful! Don\u2019t let him notice anything, especially you, Li Ziyu, got it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, Young Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly did he see? He didn\u2019t even say goodbye\u2026\u201d muttered Lin Shuxuan. Then he stood up and said, \u201cYou guys stay and watch this place, I\u2019m going to go follow him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Shuxuan glowered at them. \u201cYou guys had better listen to me, otherwise I\u2019ll send you guys to that place. Let\u2019s see if you guys dare to misbehave then!\u201d</p><br/><p>When \u2018that place\u2019 was brought up, their faces immediately paled and they went silent.</p><br/><p>Lin Shuxuan gave another humph, then got up and walked off the stage while fanning himself with the fan.</p><br/><p>Nearby, County Magistrate said to the imperial envoy, \u201cThis Young Master Lin is very suspicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

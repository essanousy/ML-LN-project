Tang Doudou silently complained in her heart. However, she dutifully pulled out an expression as if she was deep in thought. \u201cThis, hmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head da ren, there\u2019s no harm in saying what you think,\u201d said Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>As this ball was kicked over by Baili Yu rather than Feng Yunhuan, it was worthwhile to consider what exactly Baili Yu meant by it.</p><br/><p>Since she couldn\u2019t figure it out, she could only buy more time for now. Knitting her brows, she asked Feng Yunhuan, \u201cIs there any use in me giving my take?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yunhuan naturally didn\u2019t want to hear her talk. However, he recalled how she had been able to kill Xin Yue with one blow. It was evident, from that incident, that her inner strength was scarily strong. Yet afterwards, she didn\u2019t even know qinggong and he had been able to easily trap her in the sea of flames. Had Baili Yu not rushed there in time, she would have been dead! However, in Azure Water Valley, she had been able to scare the old woman into fleeing with one strike yet again.</p><br/><p>It looks like the people that looked the most unreliable were, in reality, the most impossible to predict.</p><br/><p>This was something Lord Superior had warned him about when he headed out.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t this description fit Li Xueyi perfectly?</p><br/><p>The condition of Baili Yu\u2019s injury is unclear and the skill of Li Xueyi\u2019s martial arts was unpredictable and impossible to measure. It was no wonder the two of them would be so unconcerned and fearless.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the matters of the Jianghu is up to Alliance Head da ren to decide, of course Alliance Head da ren\u2019s words will be the authority for this small matter.\u201d Feng Yunhuan rotated the antique lamp in his hand. Last time, she had insisted on having this lamp. Could it be that she also knows of this lamp\u2019s secret?</p><br/><p>Tch, as if her words could possibly be that useful.</p><br/><p>Who in the world doesn\u2019t know that in reality, she was just a puppet that took a laissez-faire attitude? Bai Feiyun dealt with everything, and Bai Feiyun also simply followed the commands of the Lord of Cloud City. To put it bluntly, the entire Jianghu was the Lord of Cloud City\u2019s Jianghu, it didn\u2019t have half a coin to do with her.</p><br/><p>If it was the previous Li Xueyi, it didn\u2019t matter much. But she had nothing to do with that Lord of Cloud City at all. The relationship between the two of them wasn\u2019t even as close as the relationship she had with Baili Yu. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she needed someone to cure the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance for her, she would have already dusted off her butt and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since you\u2019re both willing to listen to me, then this Alliance Head shall give some views.\u201d Tang Doudou copied Baili Yu\u2019s profound and mysterious smile and made a \u2018please\u2019 gesture towards Feng Yunhuan. \u201cThe air in the carriage isn\u2019t that great. Why don\u2019t we chat outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she sent Baili Yu a look, indicating for him to rest for a while.</p><br/><p>However, Baili Yu imperceptibly shook his head and rejected her good intentions, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wind outside. It\u2019s best if Alliance Head Li makes the long story short. Unlike us, Protector Feng has a lot of matters to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he meant was for her to make him leave!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou finally understood.</p><br/><p>Thus, she walked towards Feng Yunhuan and stopped about three steps away from him. She gave a heavy sigh, then said with a heartfelt tone, \u201cXiao Huan ah!\u201d (Little Huan ah!)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head da ren.\u201d Feng Yunhuan nodded as he moved backwards a little.</p><br/><p>He was afraid, afraid that Tang Doudou had walked closer in order to take advantage of an opportunity to capture him. After all, they were currently surrounded by his subordinates so it would be difficult for them to charge through the encirclement. However, if they captured him, they would be able to boldly swagger their way out.</p><br/><p>The thing he couldn\u2019t understand the most was that since both of them had good martial arts, what were they wasting so much time for?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, where did the other person on the carriage go?</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan was like Baili Yu\u2019s shadow and always by his side. Where did he go?</p><br/><p>Feng Yunhuan was incomparably shrewd. It\u2019s just that he overthought things too much. If he had given the command to attack the carriage right when he arrived, Tang Doudou and Baili Yu would already be cold corpses.</p><br/><p>Yet, due to him being overly cautious and worried that Baili Yu was purposefully luring him out, he kept hesitating and didn\u2019t make a move. This was what gave Ye Chuan sufficient time.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan\u2019s martial arts didn\u2019t count as very good on the Jianghu though it wasn\u2019t too bad. However, the reason why Baili Yu valued him and allowed him to be the head of the hidden guards was because he was very good at concealing his presence. He was so good that it could be called perfection. Sometimes, you might not even see him when he\u2019s standing right in front of you!</p><br/><p>Originally, he was still panicking over how to save Baili Yu since the opponent had so many fighters. If they all started to move, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to deal with them even if he had three heads and six arms!</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Feng Yunhuan actually indicated to his subordinates not to act without thinking and to separate and be on standby. This was perfect for Ye Chuan. He borrowed the cover of the forest and secretly got rid of over half the concealed people.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan placed down the person he had just dealt with. He was now very close to the carriage.</p><br/><p>His expression could not be seen as he looked at the carriage. Ever since that person had entered, the carriage had been extremely quiet without a sound. He didn\u2019t know how his master was doing.</p><br/><p>However, he hadn\u2019t heard Tang Doudou\u2019s cry of alarm or seen that person get off the carriage so it was likely that his master was still fine. He decided to increase his speed and get rid of these hateful guys faster in order to rush back to the carriage.</p><br/><p>From the start, this had been Baili Yu\u2019s plan \u2013 to keep the commander occupied in order to give Ye Chuan time to get rid of those little footmen.</p><br/><p>He knew his people the best. Though Ye Chuan wasn\u2019t anything special in open confrontation battles, no one could escape his clutches in the shadows.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they had already sent out the SOS signal earlier. If their people were around, they would currently be rushing this way. As long as they had enough time, they would be able to escape safe and unharmed.</p><br/><p>However, Feng Yunhuan must not figure it out.</p><br/><p>Thinking to here, he looked towards Tang Doudou worriedly. He hoped that she wouldn\u2019t disappoint him. He knew that she had already misunderstood his words but he couldn\u2019t give her another hint. The rest will depend on luck.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sensed that his gaze seemed to contain other meanings so she pondered his words again. Connecting his words with everything he did during this period of time, a light bulb flickered on in her head. So it was like this!</p><br/><p>Fart as if he was telling her to chase Feng Yunhuan away. Baili Yu was speaking in opposites. What he meant by telling her to make the long story short was to have her make the short story long!</p><br/><p>But, would he be able to hold up?</p><br/><p>She glanced worriedly at Baili Yu and saw that he had his eyes closed and was calmly napping on the couch.</p><br/><p>She looked back at Feng Yunhuan and saw that his expression was not pretty at all. He was probably angry because Baili Yu was acting too condescending. After kicking the ball to Tang Doudou, he went off to nap. This was a complete lack of respect!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gave a cough and took advantage of Feng Yunhuan\u2019s absentmindedness to pat his shoulder. \u201cSay, Xiao Huan, are you interested in Baili gongzi or something? You keep looking at him so anxiously. Even I find it embarrassing to watch!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

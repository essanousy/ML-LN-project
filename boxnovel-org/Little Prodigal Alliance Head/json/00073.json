She abruptly opened her eyes and met with Baili Yu\u2019s half smiling face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually played me! Baili Yu, you bastard! Shameless damned fox!\u201d Tang Doudou gnashed her teeth as she cursed. She felt the urge to just rush up and bite this guy to death. Putting aside the fact that he stole her first kiss, he actually played her! That was far too much!</p><br/><p>However, a suspicious red flush crawled up her face when she recalled her reaction earlier. Fuck! She was definitely bewitched earlier. How could she have closed her eyes otherwise!?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu simply admired the way her completely flustered appearance for a few moments. He kept Tang Doudou\u2019s hands tightly locked so that she couldn\u2019t budge an inch, and he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s Xueyi angry about? Xueyi was also this obedient and passionate that night\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he even breathed on her neck and caused her to feel an uncomfortable tickle.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was truly about to fall apart after he brought up that night again. She wasn\u2019t crushed because she was used as a man, but due to the fact that she actually couldn\u2019t remember anything.</p><br/><p>All she remembered was that she pushed Baili Yu down. She didn\u2019t have any recollection of the events succeeding that. It was seriously illogical. Tang Doudou would sometimes even wonder if Baili Yu was lying to her.</p><br/><p>However, being able to not remember was also a good thing. She might\u2019ve felt even more depressed if she had remembered.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d (actual Chinese word is roll)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t how you talked on the mattress that night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Da fudge, could you stop bringing that night up!?</p><br/><p>A single slip was truly enough to cause an everlasting sorrow ah!</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for that night, how could she have fallen to such a plight and be forced to take Baili Yu as a bride? The more Tang Doudou thought about it, the angrier she got. She was grinding her teeth so much that they were crackling, but she was helpless as her hands were pinned down and she also being pressed down on top of the table. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she couldn\u2019t get up, she definitely would have leaped up and chomped him. See if he can still laugh then!?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, you\u2019re angry?\u201d Baili Yu lifted his other hand and gently slid it across her face as he called, \u201cXueyi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this gentle tone that had never existed before, Tang Doudou\u2019s entire body trembled and she almost teared up.</p><br/><p>She preferred when Baili Yu spoke with a languid tone. At least that wasn\u2019t as scary as this! This tone and scene caused her to have a very bad feeling ah!</p><br/><p>She was even in a bit of a predicament. There\u2019s no way this evil spirit got aroused, right?</p><br/><p>No way he wants to do that with her here, right?</p><br/><p>Fudging hell! Please don\u2019t ah!</p><br/><p>She was completely muddle-headed after getting drunk last time and didn\u2019t remember what she did at all, so she could treat it as if it never happened!E/C</p><br/><p>But she was especially clear-headed today ah!</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t dare to imagine what it would feel like to have a repeat of the events from that night while she was sober\u2026</p><br/><p>No!</p><br/><p>No way! She can\u2019t let that kind of thing happen again!</p><br/><p>It was seriously too scary!E/C2</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu, calm down! Th-this is Rutaceae Pavilion! Lou Qingyun will be back in a little while\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Da hell, if she had a female identity, she would have been able to use her auntie as an excuse. What could she possible say now?</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, then he can just come. What about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen he arrives and sees this\u2026 what if he sees!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, Xueyi is so bad. What are you thinking in that little head of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026when Tang Doudou heard this, she realized she\u2019d been played again. Her brain seriously must\u2019ve been sandwiched useless when she headed out today!</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis husband is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>A certain person chuckled. Tang Doudou\u2019s utterly discomfited expression made his mood exceptionally good.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram(roll)!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like this? Tang Doudou was surprised and looked up, only to see that Baili Yu was wearing a roguish smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cXueyi, don\u2019t feel so impatient. This husband will roll(scram) for you right now.\u201d He then lifted her from the table. Their bodies whirled in the air and he lightly brought her with him to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu! What are you trying to do!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Tang Doudou could even react, she had already fallen with Baili Yu onto the floor. When she felt that her hands were released, she hastily sat up and tried to get up.</p><br/><p>However, an arm wrapped around her waist and abruptly tugged downwards, causing Tang Doudou to fall into a certain person\u2019s expansive embrace once again,.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou seriously couldn\u2019t help but give a wry smile. Based on Baili Yu\u2019s current position, could it be that he really planned to roll with her on the ground?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s to roll(scram)\u2026\u201d Baili Yu said lightheartedly. Yet, his large hand was disobediently wandering on Tang Doudou\u2019s body, \u201cNever thought that Wife actually liked being on the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the precedents from before, Tang Doudou just gave a disdainful humph this time. To try and use the same trick on her three times, he\u2019s underestimating her too much!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou ignored the wandering movements of Baili Yu\u2019s hand. On a different note, due to the fact that Baili Yu was half on top of Tang Doudou, his wide robe naturally opened to expose and alluring sight that swayed in front of Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes. Tang Doudou immediately realized that this was the perfect opportunity to act!</p><br/><p>So she naturally chomped down ferociously. She hadn\u2019t been able to hurt this evil spirit last time, so she put in plenty of effort this time around.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt that she finally managed to get some interest back when she heard Baili Yu inhale sharply. She cast a provoking smug look at Baili Yu. Small fry, how dare you tease this lady!? See if I don\u2019t bite you to death!</p><br/><p>However, just as this thought sprouted, she suddenly felt a strange change in the surrounding atmosphere.</p><br/><p>It was a very clear and conspicuous change!</p><br/><p>\u201cBai\u2026 nmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She tried to speak, but her mouth was covered once again. It didn\u2019t stop at just the shallow tasting this time. It was an actual deep kiss! It was very gentle and carried a unique sensation which almost caused Tang Doudou to be swept away.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wanted to curse, but she couldn\u2019t speak a single word as her mouth was completely blocked. She could only make an involuntary humming sound.</p><br/><p>After ruthlessly punishing this dumb woman for a while, Baili Yu finally released Tang Doudou. She actually bit him! It was a place that she shouldn\u2019t have been bit. After the initial pain, an uncontrollable feeling instantly broke out.</p><br/><p>He had originally planned not to touch her before they got married. But now!?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s breathing became rough and his voice deepened, \u201cI wasn\u2019t originally planning on doing it here, but since Wife has taken the initiative, this husband can only satisfy Wife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wife!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s brain couldn\u2019t follow the curve at all. Could he possibly know her true gender!?</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t have the time to continue thinking. Her lips were seized again by Baili Yu, he bit them as if punishing her. Baili Yu\u2019s movements were very rough as he directly pressed Tang Doudou onto the floor. Yet, he was strangely gentle at the same time. His movements were as if he was tasting a rare and unique delicacy. His gentle and shallow movements captured Tang Doudou\u2019s remaining rationality.</p><br/><p>Their overlapping breathing gradually turned rushed. After some unknown amount of time, Tang Doudou abruptly came to her senses after noticing that her front chest felt cool.</p><br/><p>When Baili Yu\u2019s hand landed on that fire-red fox on Tang Doudou\u2019s shoulder, she suddenly understood everything!</p><br/><p>She fiercely pushed Baili Yu away!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! When did you find out!?\u201d She pointed towards Baili Yu with her hands trembling. She was so dumb! If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he knew she was female, why would he suddenly get the strange idea to marry her?</p><br/><p>It was seriously a hilarious joke!</p><br/><p>Here she thought that he liked men this whole time. Looks like it was all her misunderstanding!</p><br/><p>She had misunderstood everything!</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy to tease this little milk pup until she was completely confused. Unexpectedly, she quickly returned to her senses and even escaped while he was off-guard.</p><br/><p>Looks like he was a little too impatient. His movements to take off that Jade Cicada Skin had alarmed her. It probably won\u2019t be possible to continue today.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, what are you saying? Weren\u2019t you the one that told this husband to roll for you? How come you changed your mind just as we were about to roll?\u201d Baili Yu had been pushed to a corner and his chest was exposed through his wide open collar. It moved up and down heavily as his breathing still hadn\u2019t calmed and his voice was still hoarse.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou became confused upon seeing that there was only arousal and enticing charm in his eyes. Could it be she was just overthinking things?</p><br/><p>Was the movement earlier just an accidental touch?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me wife!? I\u2019m the one taking you as a bride, you should be the wife. I\u2019m the husband!\u201d The red flush on Tang Doudou\u2019s face hadn\u2019t receded either. She wasn\u2019t certain if Baili Yu\u2019s movements had truly been inadvertent, so she tried interrogating him a different way.</p><br/><p>How could Baili Yu possibly stay clueless to her current suspicions after hearing this question? This dumb woman. She had clearly guessed right already, but due to that tiny bit of suspicion in her heart, she was still rejecting him. She was seriously stupidly cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this husband likes calling you wife.\u201d He purposefully exposed a sulky expression and his peach-flower eyes gleamed brightly, \u201cCould it be that Wife doesn\u2019t like this husband calling you that? If Wife doesn\u2019t like it, this husband just won\u2019t call you that anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Waste of words! Did she look like she liked it?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. Looks like it really was just an accident. However, this accident sure was lucky. Otherwise, if things really had gone all the way to the end, she definitely wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep her female identity concealed. Who asked her auntie to be visiting right now!</p><br/><p>She tugged her clothes that had been pulled open and swiftly climbed up from the floor. Tang Doudou walked around the other side to the front of the table and reached out to pick up the antique lamp, \u201cYou can just call me whatever you like. This Alliance Head must head back now. I\u2019ll have Boss Qing tell Lou Qingyun to hand you the money directly!\u201d</p><br/><p>She ran to the door after saying that. Then, she opened it and ran off without waiting to hear Baili Yu\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>Glancing at her hurriedly fleeing figure, Baili Yu\u2019s lips curved as he reached up and touched the residue fragrance next to his lips. She\u2019ll be his sooner or later. There was no rush, no rush\u2026</p><br/><p>On the other hand, after just running out, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t even reach the back door of Rutaceae Pavilion before she was stopped by someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Alliance Head Li heading in such a hurry?\u201d The person that blocked Tang Doudou\u2019s path was Boss Qing. However, her current smile was completely different from before and carried hints of contempt and disdain.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was rather speechless seeing this. When did she offend this person?</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even seem to know this woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Boss Qing blocking my way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, Alliance Head Li really likes to joke. How could this qie* dare block you? It\u2019s simply that the Pavilion Master wishes to see you and had this qie carry the message.\u201d Boss Qing said in a cottequish voice with the corner of her mouth covered.</p><br/><p> \u2013 \u201cqie\u201d concubine; this consort, can also be used by women with basically the meaning of \u2018this servant\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cPavilion Master? What Pavilion Master? I don\u2019t seem to know any Pavilion Masters?\u201d She had gotten to know quite a lot of the Jianghu sects during the past two weeks with Bai Feiyun\u2019s help, but she didn\u2019t have any impression of some Pavilion Master.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s precisely because you don\u2019t know each other that the Pavilion Master wanted to meet you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was currently completely muddled after experiencing Baili Yu\u2019s teasing, so there was no way she was in the mood to meet a Pavilion Master. She tactfully declined, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, I don\u2019t feel very well today so I\u2019ll have to trouble you to convey my apologies to that Pavilion Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Tang Doudou walked around Boss Qing without waiting for her reply.</p><br/><p>However, before she even took two steps, a sudden fragrance filled her nose and her vision went black. With a \u2018thud\u2019, she collapsed into the underbrush to the side.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although I\u2019m not the boss, I make the decisions here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sized up this Qing gongzi. He was a beautiful man, and she had figured that he had a high status here based on how he had order those two prostitutes around, but she hadn\u2019t expected him to the be the person in charge.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to deceive Sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, call all the prostitutes here for me. I want to pick a few that are pleasing to the eye to entertain me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Qing gongzi\u2018s expression became troubled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is the money not enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>This person brought up money in every single sentence, he was truly coarse. However, the reason they started this business was to earn money, so even though Qing gongzi was annoyed, he continued smiling softly, \u201cSir is joking. I\u2019ll go tell them to dress up right now, then I\u2019ll bring them here to greet Sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, go!\u201d Tang Doudou waved her hand dismissively.</p><br/><p>Qing gongzi bowed, then turned and headed upstairs.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, something occurred to him and he turned around to say, \u201cIt takes quite some time for the boys to dress up, so Sir, why don\u2019t you head to the room first to have some alcohol and enjoy music as you wait?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Tang Doudou also felt that sitting in the main hall attracted too much attention. When she heard his suggestion, she immediately jumped off the table and stuffed all the banknotes on the table back into her chest. After all, who would pay the fee before even getting a prostitute?</p><br/><p>She started following Qing gongzi. When they got upstairs, she suddenly heard a familiar guqin song and froze in place.</p><br/><p>Qing gongzi turned around and asked with a soft laugh, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Sir?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou snapped back to her senses as a flustered expression flashed through her eyes. She hadn\u2019t been wrong, that person was definitely Baili Yu. Baili Yu had played this song for her when they had been heading to Cerulean Mountain!</p><br/><p>She quickly calmed down and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just feel like this song is quite nice and wanted to listen for a while longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Baili Yu, but what happened to his inner strength and martial arts?</p><br/><p>Was the reason why he hadn\u2019t returned to Huai City and made no contact with the people of the Chamber of Commerce because he had lost his martial arts and got stuck here? Or was it because Nangong Yan was also here?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, where was Nangong Yan?</p><br/><p>It seemed that her choice to scope out the situation first was correct. Since the enemy whereabouts was uncertain, it was best to be cautious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song is pretty good,\u201d replied Qing gongzi with a smile. Then he pushed open the door in front of him. \u201cSir, please wait here for a while. I\u2019ll go arrange for the boys to come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou retrieved her thoughts, gave an \u2018en,\u2019 then walked into the room.</p><br/><p>She had gone to a lot of brothels before, but she had never gone to a male brothel. She saw that the decoration was very serene and elegant with an unique charm to it. There was a faint, barely noticeable fragrance lingering in the room. This place didn\u2019t have that strong overpowering coy decoration so it was actually quite refreshing. So this was what a male brothel was like!</p><br/><p>Soon after she walked in, a delicate-looking young man walked in with several plates of side dishes and a jar of wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Tang Doudou stared at the prostitute in front of her. He looked only around fifteen and his features hadn\u2019t fully developed yet, but hints of his future handsomeness could already be seen. In a few years, he\u2019ll probably turned out almost like Qing gongzi. She couldn\u2019t help but feel that it was strange. Hibiscus Garrison was only oh so big, so how was a little male brothel like this able to have so many good-looking young men?</p><br/><p>Even in the brothels she had visited in the past, there were only a few good-looking women. For the rest, had they not dusted their face white with powder, their faces probably would have been unbearable to look at.</p><br/><p>She recalled the male prostitute she had seen on the way here. Although not all of them were stunning, they were still pleasing to the eye. Only a ghost would believe that there was nothing off about this.</p><br/><p>When she asked that question, the young man blushed slightly before replying sweetly, \u201cSir, this servant\u2019s name is Jin Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was even more coquettish than that of a woman. It was so sweet that it caused Tang Doudou to drop a floorful of goosebumps. Inwardly, she was thinking that it was no wonder some men liked visiting male brothels. Male prostitutes like this were more alluring than even the best courtesans of some places.</p><br/><p>When he lowered his eyes in a cute and bashful manner, Tang Doudou lifted his chin and remarked lightly, \u201cJin Yi? Nice name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Yi blushed even more. His embarrassed appearance caused Tang Doudou\u2019s wolf heart to leap. \u201cJin Yi ah, how long have you worked here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yi\u2019s eyes whirled, then he said in a slightly sad tone, \u201cReplying Sir, this servant came to Wind Cherishing Building as a child. As of now, it\u2019s already been fourteen years.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was only fourteen? Wasn\u2019t that a little too young?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid all of you come here as children?\u201d Tang Doudou lifted the chopsticks and used them to pick up some vegetables. She indicated for Jin Yi to open his mouth, then gently fed him. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, I just want to chat a little with you. I won\u2019t be doing anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>People tended to lower their guards when they were eating.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

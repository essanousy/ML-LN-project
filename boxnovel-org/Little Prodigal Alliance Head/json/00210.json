This concealment ability was practically a cheat.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t reply and furrowed his brows as he looked around.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his gaze sharpened and he lifted Tang Doudou up and flew into the air. At the same time, the antique lamp that had been floating in front of him flew out. However, this time the lamp didn\u2019t manage to hit Liu Zhiyuan before it flew backwards again.</p><br/><p>They landed on a nearby roof. Jun Xin\u2019s expression became very serious. It wasn\u2019t impossible for him to defeat Liu Zhiyuan. Usually, he would have already injured him by now.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou also noticed that she was hindering Jun Xin. He had made a move several times but still hadn\u2019t manage to force Liu Zhiyuan to come out. She was starting to panic, so she grabbed Jun Xin\u2019s sleeve and suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave me at the side for now in order to focus on dealing with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin rejected the idea. \u201cNo way, his goal is you. If I put you down, he\u2019ll definitely give up on fighting with me and head straight over to kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin put it this way, Tang Doudou immediately caught on as well, so she reached out and hugged Jun Xin tightly. \u201cT-then my little life is in your hands. You had better protect me well ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>After all the incidents she\u2019d been through, Tang Doudou felt that she was only getting more and more scared of dying.</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin saw her dangling from him like a timid mouse, he couldn\u2019t help but tease her with a smirk, \u201cWoman, you\u2019re hugging me so tightly. It couldn\u2019t be that you want to abandon Baili Yu and throw yourself into my arms?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! Who wants to throw themselves into your arms. You\u2019re just a butt-aged brat that doesn\u2019t even have a neat layer of fur yet, yet your thoughts are so dirty!\u201d This kid was seriously thinking too much!</p><br/><p>The depths of Jun Xin\u2019s eyes dimmed a little, but he didn\u2019t show it much. He continued speaking with a slight smirk, \u201cWhat\u2019s not good about being with this little master? At the very least, if you\u2019re with this little master, this little master wouldn\u2019t attract any malicious women that would harm you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. \u201cQuit chatting and defeat Liu Zhiyuan quickly so that we can all go home to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason Tang Doudou could get so close to Jun Xin without any feelings of unease was because she only thought of him as a younger brother. In addition, the current situation was very dangerous. If she didn\u2019t hold on to Jun Xin tightly to free his hands so he could deal with Liu Zhiyuan, they\u2019d probably both end up in a bad situation. Her life would probably end up in serious peril.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid woman, how am I supposed to fight if you hug me so tightly?\u201d Jun Xin could guess most of what was going through her head, but in the end he was a normal man. Even if he didn\u2019t want to, he couldn\u2019t help but get stirred up when being hugged this way by the woman he liked, so there was no way he\u2019d be able to focus on fighting Liu Zhiyuan.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily loosened her grip a tiny bit, then lifted her head to ask, \u201cIt\u2019s fine now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>How was this any different from before?</p><br/><p>Jun Xin shook his head as the antique lamp moved back into his hand. He had to silently chant a mind-clearing chant a few times before he managed to suppress the rising abnormality.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll have to fight if we go on like this. In a bit, I\u2019ll use the antique lamp to temporarily keep him occupied, and we\u2019ll take that chance to run!\u201d said Jun Xin in a lowered voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! If you can\u2019t beat someone, just run! Good idea!\u201d Tang Doudou was very much in favor of this proposal. It suited her personality well.</p><br/><p>However, it made Jun Xin really speechless. \u201cWhen did this little master say that I couldn\u2019t beat him!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, let\u2019s not mind these little details!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStinkin\u2019 woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he had endured for too long and couldn\u2019t control his inner strength well, there was no way he would have had to resort to this idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on tight!\u201d Jun Xin warned, then his gaze sharpened and a strong chilling aura arose from all around. The blue light from the antique lamp also became increasingly dazzling, as if it was trying to light the entire world blue.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was close by and couldn\u2019t take this eye-piercing blue so she had to turn her head away and close her eyes.</p><br/><p>It was unknown what Jun Xin had done before he jumped up with her. She lost her grip for a moment and almost fell down.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin hastily caught her, then carried her in a princess hold.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve trapped him in the antique lamp\u2019s array. Let\u2019s take advantage of this time to hurry and leave,\u201d said Jun Xin as he worked on identifying their location. Once he had, he started flying forward. They soon came to a street that was slightly more populated and he let Tang Douodu down.</p><br/><p>When he was putting her down, he accidently touched the injury on his arm and gave a muffled groan from pain. Only then did he notice that blood was flowing incessantly and that it was about to dye that area of his clothes red.</p><br/><p>\u201cNangong Yan is seriously too much!\u201d Tang Doudou was angry since she would have been drinking tea with the King of Hell by now if it weren\u2019t for Jun Xin\u2019s quick reaction. When she saw Jun Xin\u2019s injury, she became even more furious!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll see you back to the City Lord Residence first.\u201d Jun Xin tore a strip of cloth off the hem of his garment and casually bandaged the injury.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt like that wouldn\u2019t do. That injury was bleeding so much, it definitely wasn\u2019t shallow. \u201cLet\u2019s not head back to the City Lord Residence yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin felt a stab of pain in his heart. She didn\u2019t want to go back to the City Lord Residence, does this mean that she wanted to go find Baili Yu right away?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

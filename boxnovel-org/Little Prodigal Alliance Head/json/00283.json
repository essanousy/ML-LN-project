You said you wouldn\u2019t die! What do I do now? What do I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou cursed, she tried to wipe away those black lines with her hand, but the black lines were actually results of poison being inside his body, so how could she possibly wipe it off?</p><br/><p>As she wiped, tears spilled down. She also understood that this was a pointless attempt. She had to get the antidote to the Hoarfrost Poison now, or Baili Yu would die.</p><br/><p>But where was she supposed to find the antidote?</p><br/><p>Even though she was currently in the midst of the Seven Great Saint Tribes, she didn\u2019t know who to look for to ask for an antidote. Lan Jia?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, she\u2019ll look for him! Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t come up with any other ideas, so she settled Baili Yu down, then ran towards the door.</p><br/><p>She reached out to open the door, but despite tugging several times, she still couldn\u2019t get it open. She tried a some more with no result. She had been locked in!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was furious. What was that bastard Lan Jia trying to do!?</p><br/><p>She fiercely kicked the door a couple times. Then there came the sound of Lan Jia\u2019s amused voice, \u201cLady Doudou, could it be that you\u2019re not happy with Brother Baili Yu? Why so angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was actually outside!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s anger rushed to her head and she shouted, \u201cLan Jia, you shameless bastard! What exactly did you do to Baili Yu!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia responded with surprise, \u201cWhat does Lady Doudou mean? This one doesn\u2019t understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit acting! There\u2019s no way that I\u2019ll believe you if you say you don\u2019t know why Baili Yu\u2019s like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 since Lady Doudou has guessed it, then I won\u2019t try to hide it any longer. I am indeed the one who made Brother Baili like this.\u201d Lan Jia stopped trying to deny it.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said, \u201cSay it. What do I have to do for you to turn him back to normal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia tsked and said with a tone of pity, \u201cI\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t be able to go back to normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! I don\u2019t believe you! Hurry up and tell me or I\u2019ll burn this crappy place of yours down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Doudou, please calm down. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s impossible, it\u2019s just a bit troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and just say it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia seemed to have moved closer to the door. Then he said in a quiet voice, \u201cLady Doudou, actually, Brother Baili\u2019s current condition can\u2019t be blamed completely on me. It was the Saint King\u2019s orders, so we as subordinates have no choice but to obey, right? However, Lady Doudou has misunderstood this one. Everything this one does is for you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you stop wasting time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia laughed. \u201cThis one just wants Lady Doudou to understand the situation more clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s thoughts were currently filled with Baili Yu, so she had no patience for his ramblings. She urged him to hurry again, so Lan Jia finally continued, \u201dOriginally, the Saint King had arranged for Brother Baili to marry the Saint Maiden, but I greatly admire the Saint Maiden, so how could I allow her to marry someone who has no feelings for her? That was why I came up with this plan to swap out the brides.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was very difficult to distinguish between the truth and lies in his words. Even Baili Yu had been deceived by him for many years, so how could Tang Doudou possibly be able to see through his lies?</p><br/><p>She felt like his explanation was quite reasonable and started mumbling to herself in confusion. Could it be that she was wrong in blaming him?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what did you do with the Saint Maiden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApologies, that, I can not tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t actually very interested in the location of the Saint Maiden and had only asked this in passing. Since he didn\u2019t tell her, she moved on to asking about how to get Baili Yu back to normal.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia replied, \u201cActually, it\u2019s quite simple. As long as Lady Doudou and Brother Baili consummates this marriage and destroys the Command Grub in his body, he\u2019ll return to normal tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that simple?\u201d Tang Doudou wanted to slap herself the moment those words came out of her mouth. This was simple? The price was her chastity ah!</p><br/><p>Lan Jia also seemed to have been shocked by this remark. However, he soon returned to his senses and said, \u201cSince Lady Doudou now knows the way, this one will be excusing himself in order to avoid disrupting you two\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou saw that he was about to leave, she hastily called out, \u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you get me the clothes Baili Yu was wearing before?\u201d Tang Doudou suddenly recalled that Baili Yu had always been carrying the booklet and tools to cure the Hoarfrost Poison with him.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia hesitated. \u201cThis\u2026 I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be a little difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Tang Doudou\u2019s heart sank. Just as she was about to speak again, Lan Jia said, \u201cHowever, since I\u2019m here to help, I\u2019ll definitely help to the very end. Lady Doudou, wait a little. I\u2019ll be back right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s expression immediately brightened up when she heard that there was hope. As she thanked Lan Jia, inwardly she was thinking that she really had wrongly accused him.</p><br/><p>When Lan Jia heard this, he smiled slightly. Then his footsteps soon faded into the distance.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know when he would be back, so as she mulled over his words, she walked back to the bed. Baili Yu was no longer clutching his chest in pain anymore, but his brows were still tightly furrowed.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou reached out and stroke his forehead as she pressed her lips together worriedly. Baili Yu, please be alright!</p><br/><p>When her gaze landed on his naked upper body, she suddenly recalled what Lan Jia said earlier and retrieved her hand like it had been scalded. She blushed slightly. Would he really go back to normal if they consummated?</p><br/><p>But he had already passed out. How was she supposed to consummate on her own?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

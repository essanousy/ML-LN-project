No wonder Su gongzi was able to keep your position as the Lord of Cloud City stable for over a hundred years!\u201d</p><br/><p>If Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t fainted already, she would have fainted upon hearing this. This young man that seemed only about twenty was actually the City Lord of their discussions!</p><br/><p>And Baili Yu said \u2018over a hundred years\u2019. That was too illogical with Su Yi\u2019s looks!</p><br/><p>Su Yi lifted his brows and leaned on the side of the carriage. His attitude changed now that his identity had been revealed. \u201cResplendent Prince ah, Resplendent Prince. Aren\u2019t you a little too concerned about this chess piece of mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m concerned about is my wife, not your chess piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, looks like you know she\u2019s a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes City Lord Su mean that I\u2019m blind?\u201d Baili Yu bent down to pick up the unconscious Tang Doudou and his eyes swept across her chest.</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s face immediately darkened. He gritted his teeth and said angrily, \u201cBaili Yu! If you dare touch her I\u2019ll have your Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce close down for good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh? Is City Lord Su threatening ben wang?\u201d Baili Yu looked towards Su Yi with provocation in his eyes as the corners of his lips hooked even higher.</p><br/><p>Su Yi found a place to sit down and ignored Baili Yu\u2019s provocation. Pushing aside the hair that had fallen loose over his forehead due to the fight earlier, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to threaten you, Resplendent Prince. It\u2019s just a little reminder. I hope Resplendent Prince will think twice before acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I thank City Lord Su\u2019s well-meaning intentions. However ah, my family\u2019s wife has fainted and City Lord Su\u2019s plan has also failed. Does City Lord Su still intend to shameless insist on staying? Or is it that City Lord Su wishes to fight me once more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFight? Can you beat me with the condition your body is currently in? That\u2019s right, and I heard you were planning to take a wife. Can you even do it?T/N\u201d Su Yi looked Baili Yu up and down. \u201cAre you planning to go to Azure Water Valley now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s eyes darkened when his source of pain was brought up. Then, he started shooing the person away. \u201cCity Lord Su has many affairs to attend to so this one won\u2019t keep you any longer. Please go ahead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi kept his old insincere smile on his face. \u201cCang Baicao isn\u2019t in Azure Water Valley. Even if you go, it\u2019s no use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for City Lord Su to take the trouble to worry over that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, is that so?\u201d Su Yi stood up and started walking towards the carriage exit. He only turned around with curved smiling eyes when he reached the door. \u201cThen I\u2019m leaving. Hopefully Resplendent Prince won\u2019t regret chasing me off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t respond to him. However, he sent his inner strength downwards and directly shook Su Yi, who was standing at the entrance, off the carriage.</p><br/><p>Following that, there was the sound of a heavy object hitting the ground accompanied by Su Yi\u2019s miserable shriek, \u201cF*ck! Baili Yu, you bastard! My waist ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t want to bother with him. He looked down and saw that the carriage had been made into a mess by the fight earlier. He wanted to step forward but couldn\u2019t find any place to place his foot. Thus, he shouted towards the entrance, \u201cOld Ding, find Ye Chuan. Switch carriages!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d replied Steward Ding, then he headed off to go find Ye Chuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Old Steward, come help out a little?\u201d Su Yi grimaced as he called out.</p><br/><p>Steward Ding didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to him. \u201cThis old man still has some matters to take care of. Su gongzi, please do as you please!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he turned away and left.</p><br/><p>Su Yi was left there on the ground to shout helplessly, unable to get up.</p><br/><p>By the time Tang Doudou woke up, the carriage head already been switched.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that Su Yi?\u201d Tang Doudou really wanted to curse as she rubbed her aching temple. She didn\u2019t even know how many times she had passed out by now.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t seem that well. He closed his eyes and didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m asking you something. Su\u2026\u201d She was startled when Baili Yu suddenly opened his eyes while she was in the middle of speaking and shot a look over. She covered her little heart as she muttered in a quiet voice, \u201cWhy did he freaking wreck me like that and then just run off\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu only retrieved his gaze after hearing what she muttered. He asked curiously, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know who he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares who he is? In any case, the next time I see him I\u2019m gonna thrash him all over! Not a single part will be spared! Until he can\u2019t even take care of himself!\u201d Tang Doudou sat up and looked around the carriage. This carriage seemed much more spacious than the previous once and there were a lot more things inside too. Her gaze slowly wandered around the carriage\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not right ah, something\u2019s off. What thingamajig is that?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou widened her eyes as she started taking small steps towards the unknown object in the carriage.</p><br/><p>Just as she was only a few steps away from that thing, it suddenly turned around. Two dark black eyes stared lifelessly at her.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

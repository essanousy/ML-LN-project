Jun Xin!\u201d As she saw his eyes close, even though she knew that she could save him with the revival pill, she couldn\u2019t help but feel so sad that it felt like her heart was shattering\u2026</p><br/><p>Her hands trembled as she took out the black vial. She quickly opened it and was just about to pour out the revival pill when a gust of wind hit her. She was caught completely unprepared, so the revival pill was swept away by that wind. She looked over and saw that Grandma Shen was smiling coldly while pinching the revival pill that had been carried over by the gust of wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, you!\u201d Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t been prepared for this at all. She was stunned, but even more so, angry with herself. Why had she been so careless? Since Grandma Shen had already found out about Jun Xin, then her identity had naturally been revealed as well!</p><br/><p>However, she had been panicking too much to think of this earlier and had forgotten about Grandma Shen\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>And now, Grandma Shen was holding onto the only revival pill that could save Jun Xin. Her eyes turned cold. \u201cGive it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it back? Hahaha\u2026\u201d Grandma Shen started laughing loudly. \u201cGive it back? Why would I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma Shen, there is no bad history between us. I know that you were only following Shen Moru\u2019s orders back in Tree Valley and as of now, Shen Moru\u2019s already dead. This Barbarian Mound Garrison is filled with people from my Alliance Head Residence while you\u2019re alone by yourself. So it\u2019s best that you don\u2019t make yourself my enemy!\u201d There was only half an incense stick\u2019s time. If that time passed, Jun Xin was done for! Tang Doudou was extremely worried, but she didn\u2019t let it show and threatened Grandma Shen calmly.</p><br/><p>Her words were true. Although Grandma Shen had very high medical expertise, her martial arts weren\u2019t very strong. She hadn\u2019t been able to stand a chance against Mu Ye back when they were in Tree Valley.</p><br/><p>Although the people from the martial arts alliance weren\u2019t as good at martial arts as Mu Ye, they won in numbers!</p><br/><p>In addition, although she and Bai Feiyun fought, there was no way that Bai Feiyun would let that news spread, so she would still be able to make use of her position as alliance head. Once she mobilized the people of the martial arts alliance, Grandma Shen had no chances of survival!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you\u2019re threatening me with the people of the martial arts alliance? Alliance Head, you sure are good.\u201d Grandma Shen didn\u2019t seemed scared at all and just laughed coldly. \u201cSo what if I die? Having been able to drag the head of our God Firmament Palace along, death is worth it!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou saw that this threat didn\u2019t work, she was frustrated. \u201cJust say it. What exactly do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>If Grandma Shen actually wanted Jun Xin to die and wasn\u2019t aiming for anything else, she would\u2019ve immediately destroyed the revival pill, but she didn\u2019t do that and was calmly dragging things on. This made it clear that she wanted something!</p><br/><p>Since Tang Doudou had seen through Grandma Shen\u2019s schemes, Grandma Shen didn\u2019t bother to conceal her intentions and said, \u201cShen Moru was right, you are smart. Indeed, I do need your help with something, Alliance Head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me back the revival pill. I agree to it!\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t even ask what she needed help with since every second that passed decreased Jun Xin\u2019s chances at reviving. She couldn\u2019t afford to wait!</p><br/><p>Grandma Shen said, \u201cYou agreed to it without even asking what it\u2019s about. Isn\u2019t that too half-hearted? I can\u2019t trust that at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou frowned and lifted four fingers. \u201cI solemnly swear, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandma Shen only nodded after she swore on it. \u201cAlliance Head truly is refreshingly straightforward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me the revival pill!\u201d Dammit, how long was she going to drag this on? Tang Doudou could feel Jun Xin\u2019s body temperature going down. Time was gradually snatching away his hopes of life.</p><br/><p>When it occurred to her that Jun Xin might really die, Tang Doudou\u2019s gaze became sharp as a blade. Grandma Shen finally handed the revival pill over. \u201cAlliance Head, please don\u2019t forget what you\u2019ve agreed to. Here\u2019s the revival pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily took the revival pill. Just as she was about to feed it to Jun Xin, another gust of wind attacked her. However, this time she was prepared.</p><br/><p>She lifted her hand and was just about to strike towards that gust of wind when she saw that it was a gray shadow pouncing towards her. She forced her hand to a stop and exclaimed in surprise, \u201cLittle Gray?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Gray had somehow miraculously recovered. After pouncing over, he snatched the pill with his mouth and landed in Tang Doudou\u2019s arms which was also on top of Jun Xin\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cZizizi!\u201d Little Gray\u2019s expression was very anxious. He spat out the pill and held it with one hand while pointing at Grandma Shen. Then he pointed at Jun Xin and abruptly clutched his own throat like he was suffering humongous pain. Finally, he stuck out his tongue and staggered backwards to the point he fell off Jun Xin\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily reached out to catch him. Light flashed through her eyes and then she glared at Grandma Shen. \u201cYou actually dared to trick me!\u201d</p><br/><p>This Grandma Shen was truly vicious. She had actually swapped out the pills. Based on what Little Gray had said, not only was this pill not the revival pill, it was an extremely toxic poison!</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had already died, but Grandma Shen still wanted to poison him. This wasn\u2019t just cruel, it was plain evil!</p><br/><p>Grandma Shen started laughing. \u201cYou really are naive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so naive that I can\u2019t even bear to tell you the truth! Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was furious. She finally realized that she had been tricked from the very beginning. If Little Gray hadn\u2019t warned her, she would\u2019ve already fed Jun Xin this poison. At that time, even if she got the revival pill, it probably wouldn\u2019t help!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned witch, you really deserve to die!\u201d Tang Doudou was truly furious. She lowered Jun Xin and abruptly attacked Grandma Shen. Although her martial arts were nothing special, her inner strength was profound enough to crush Grandma Shen. In addition, Grandma Shen could no longer see so Tang Doudou was easily able to kick her to a corner.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou saw that her attack was effective, she walked up and slapped Grandma Shen while demanding, \u201cWhere\u2019s the revival pill!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I would keep it?\u201d Grandma Shen laughed coldly. Her completely white eyes were exceptionally eerie in the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeking death!\u201d Tang Doudou was furious to hear that the revival pill was no longer here and she pulled out her dagger to kill Grandma Shen.</p><br/><p>Grandma Shen didn\u2019t bother to dodge and just looked at her coldly. \u201cGo ahead, kill me. Once you kill me, that kid will truly be done for!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If it isn\u2019t enough, you can head to the Alliance Head Residence to request for more.\u201d</p><br/><p>She originally wanted to pull out a token or something, but then recalled that she had lost the Alliance Head Command Tablet and she didn\u2019t have anything else on her that could prove her identity.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin jumped over the railing and took out a tablet from his chest. \u201cGo ask Plum Garden instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both the Alliance Head Residence and Plum Garden weren\u2019t places that ordinary people like them dared to go!</p><br/><p>These two sirs were truly making big jokes.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the inn wasn\u2019t that damaged anyways. The shopkeeper had done business for many years. When he caught the pouch, he could tell by its weight that it contained enough to compensate for all his losses and extra, so how could he dare to ask for more? He even felt the urge to return this pouch to that Alliance Head.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for her, not only would his business have collapsed, he may have even ended up dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, I cannot accept!\u201d After these thoughts flashed through his mind, the shopkeeper moved to shove the pouch back into Tang Doudou\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin glanced over coldly and blocked him. \u201cSince she gave it to you, keep it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper wasn\u2019t someone of the Jianghu and didn\u2019t know of Blood Fiend Jun Xin\u2019s reputation, but he had seen the way those black-clothed men fled for their lives after hearing the words \u2018Blood Fiend Jun Xin.\u2019 Thus, he already knew that Jun Xin was very strong, so when Jun Xin looked at him with that cold gaze, his hand shook and he compliantly put the pouch away before looking towards Tang Doudou nervously.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled slightly. \u201cJun Xin\u2019s right, shopkeeper, please keep it. After that, please find someone to clean up the inn. You all must be tired after all this, so you should go rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she walked over to discuss things more with Syndicate Leader He. It was best to tie these people up for now and then transport them to the Alliance Head Residence tomorrow morning.</p><br/><p>However, when she walked over, it was right in time for her to hear Syndicate Leader He cried out \u2018oh no.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey commited suicide with poison!\u201d Syndicate Leader He\u2019s face was pale as he inspected the black-robed people in the main hall.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou knitted her brows as she rubbed her chin. It seemed that Flowing Clouds Palace really was not a simple organization.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin walked over and said quietly, \u201cYou should have predicted and guarded against this. Since these people had covered their faces, they were definitely trying to hide their identities. They probably kept a poison capsule in their mouths so that they could commit suicide immediately if they were discovered or caught.\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of vexation and regret passed through Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes. She had been neglectant.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin patted her shoulder and said in consolement, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s your first time, so it\u2019s hard to avoid mistakes. Since you know that this is done by Flowing Clouds Palace, you already have a place to start investigating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d At this point, that was all that she could do. However, her goal in coming to Dream Mountain this time wasn\u2019t to investigate Flowing Clouds Palace.</p><br/><p>She had Syndicate Leader He move the corpses to an empty space outside the inn and burn them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head.\u201d Syndicate Leader He looked at the large blaze in front of them and hesitated in his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSyndicate Leader He, please speak without reserve.\u201d Tang Doudou was also staring at the fire. People\u2019s deaths came so suddenly, like a flame being extinguished. A fire would burn what was left of them to ash and they would disappear from the world. Humans only lived in the world for a few dozen years, so why did they all end up having so many desires and fixations?</p><br/><p>Why not just live happily and simply for what time they had, then leave the world peacefully?</p><br/><p>Syndicate Leader He couldn\u2019t tell whether Tang Doudou\u2019s expression was that of joy or anger so he felt apprehensive. However, he still said, \u201cAlliance Head, I heard that the head of Flowing Clouds Palace is Elder Yu\u2019s nephew. Was Alliance Head aware of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She hadn\u2019t known about this, so she asked, \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, actually, I have a nephew acting as a spy in Flowing Clouds Palace. He was the one that sent me this information.\u201d Syndicate Leader He\u2019s eyes flickered. \u201cThe reason I came to this inn was because my nephew said that Flowing Clouds Palace was looking for something that would harm the Jianghu, and they had gotten information that it was in this inn. I rushed over to prevent it, but ended up falling into their crafty trap. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Alliance Head had came just in time, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cThen do you know what exactly they were looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 my nephew didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of mockery flashed through Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes before it was replaced by an expression of gratitude. \u201cSyndicate Leader He\u2019s concern for the martial arts community is truly something that us later generations should learn from. Once I return to the Alliance Head Residence, I\u2019ll definitely give Syndicate Leader He a public recognition award!\u201d</p><br/><p>Syndicate Leader He seemed overwhelmed by this show of favor and hastily lowered his head. \u201cIt is this He\u2019s responsibility to protect the martial arts community even if this He must tread through fire and water. It is nothing worthy of praise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSyndicate Leader He is being too humble,\u201d said Tang Doudou with a smile. \u201cSo that\u2019s set. It\u2019s quite late, so I\u2019ll be heading back to rest. After Syndicate Leader He finishes with these matters, you should rest as well. We can discuss the rest tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou turned around and called for Jun Xin, who was currently sitting in a tree and gazing at the moon. Then they headed into the inn together.</p><br/><p>Once they left, Syndicate Leader He\u2019s respectful expression immediately darkened as he turned to look at the almost extinguished fire. A trace of confusion flashed through his eyes. Why would Li Xueyi show up here?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou closed the door, then pulled Jun Xin to the center of the room to whisper, \u201cDid you noticed? That Syndicate Leader He seems weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t seem surprised and just yawned. \u201cEn, what about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that he had a nephew working in Flowing Clouds Palace, but if he knew about such a top secret operation, then he definitely had a high position in Flowing Clouds Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that the head of Flowing Clouds Palace is Elder Yu\u2019s nephew. This isn\u2019t logical.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin glanced at her with interest. \u201cWhy is it illogical?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then he asked with his eyebrows raised, \u201cWhat you said earlier were all lies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course ah. I just came back, I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on, how could I have a countermeasure?\u201d Tang Doudou grabbed Bai Feiyun\u2019s hand. \u201cXiao Bai ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should go find Mu Ye.\u201d Bai Feiyun moved his hand out of her grasp and walked forward a couple steps before stopping and saying this with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only one that can resolve this matter. I\u2019ve already tried all the other methods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou became even more distressed. Go find Mu Ye. Where was she supposed to go to find Mu Ye? The last time they meet was when he saved her from the God Firmament Hall\u2019s ambush while passing by.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut would Mu Ye agree to stop it? I heard that over half of Jianghu\u2019s sects have already surrendered to them. They only need to put in a little more effort to overthrow our Alliance Head Residence and proclaim themselves rulers of the Jianghu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun swept a glance at her, very confused with the difference in her manner of speech in front of others and in private. \u201cThis matter isn\u2019t something Mu Ye started. He tried to salvage the situation before but it was no use. It\u2019s likely that something has happened to the Demonic Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way? Mu Ye seems so powerful, how could he not even be in control of the matters within his sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe seems to have been looking for something. Due to this, the Protectors and Elders in the sect have started to clash. He hasn\u2019t even been back to the Demonic Sect lately, so they\u2019re like a bunch of dragons without a leader. Currently, the Demonic Sect is also messy as a pot of porridge and not doing much better than us.\u201d Bai Feiyun calmly explained to Tang Doudou. As the two spoke, they walked along the small alley and returned to the street.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou saw that the stores in Huai City seemed very gloomy. In addition, quite a lot of people hastily moved out of the way upon seeing her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is my appearance very scary?\u201d Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but reach to touch her face upon seeing this strange reaction. Could it be that a flower was growing on her face?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun ignored her and continued talking about the Demonic Sect. \u201cI\u2019ve also been looking for Mu Ye for quite a while but couldn\u2019t get hold of his exact location. I heard that during the Plum Garden Gathering, he went to find you on his own?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? That time, she and Mu Ye were the only ones present. How did other people find out?</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu has informants everywhere in Plum Garden. Your every move is within his view. This information, due to certain reasons, tends to be spread out. What I know is that not only did Mu Ye look for you on his own, that night Jun Xin crazily destroyed almost a hundred plum trees outside the wooden rooms, and even shattered Bloodthirster. After that, Jun Xin left Plum Garden and never returned.\u201d Bai Feiyun\u2019s warm eyes looked towards Tang Doudou with a probing gaze as if he couldn\u2019t see through her thoughts. \u201cThe moment you arrived in Huai City today, he returned as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tang Doudou was shocked by everything Bai Feiyun said. She had no idea that something like that had happened after she got drunk. It was likely that Jun Xin found out Baili Yu and she did dat, and so after going crazy from heartbreak, he left downheartedly\u2026</p><br/><p>Pei! What was with that? It\u2019s completely wrong!</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was back again!</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t correspond with the storyline. Why did he go berserk and leave home? And why did he only just come back?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just talk about Mu Ye first!\u201d Tang Doudou decided not to worry about Jun Xin\u2019s matter. That brat looked like a purely tsundere kid, but in reality, he was really irascible and temperamental. Just from the sound of his name, \u2018Blood Fiend Jun Xin,\u2019 one could tell how brutal of a guy he actually was.</p><br/><p>She had no intention of provoking such a frightening guy as if she had nothing else to do. Although Mu Ye was also very frightening, Tang Doudou stopped being afraid of him ever since he smiled towards her last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye\u2026 If you look for him, you\u2019ll probably find him easily.\u201d Bai Feiyun retrieved his probing gaze and spoke after a brief pause.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would it be easy for me to find him? It\u2019s not like I know him very well.\u201d They had only met about three times and probably hadn\u2019t even exchanged a total of ten sentences.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Bai Feiyun\u2019s smile turned a little strange to the point it made Tang Doudou\u2019s hair rise on end. Finally, he spoke and said, \u201cBecause he\u2019s also looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Never would have thought it ah!</p><br/><p>She actually found Mu Ye this easily.</p><br/><p>After silently staring at each other for a long while, Tang Doudou finally sighed and broke the silence. She asked curiously, \u201cWhy were you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo make a deal.\u201d Mu Ye coldly glanced at her, then spat out these words.</p><br/><p>He was truly cold to the point that it made people shiver beneath the scorching sun.</p><br/><p>The deal he was talking about, it was probably the one he mentioned back in Plum Garden?</p><br/><p>Last time she had thoroughly disgusted Mu Ye ah. As Tang Doudou thought to here, she asked with an unnatural expression, \u201cWhat deal could the two of us possibly make?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big brother ah, let\u2019s not be so miserly with our words so much when speaking, alright? It\u2019s not like I charge you per word!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently criticized as she rubbed her nose. Recalling what Bai Feiyun told her earlier, her heart calmed down and she asked, \u201cThen what you\u2019re saying is that what you\u2019re looking for is with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s cold gaze swept over, sharp as a knife. \u201cCorrect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jesus ah! The Mu Ye she encountered last time was an imposter, was it? Moreover, she daydreamed that he smiled towards her. This right now was practically a slap to the face!</p><br/><p>The person in front of her right now was probably the true Mu Ye, just his gaze was enough to make her calves tremble. Tang Doudou gulped and moved to the side to avoid that knife-like gaze. \u201cAhem, what is it? There\u2019s no harm in saying it. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she even finished speaking, Mu Ye\u2019s cold eyes appeared right in front of her again. Words jumped out one by one from those thin lips. \u201cYour life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, ha, w-what are you joking about? I-it\u2019s not funny at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>He actually wanted her life! Then what did he save her for last time? Was he mentally ill!?</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s gaze was cold and seemed completely inhuman. His eyes were deep and seemed to engulf her like a whirlpool without leaving a trace! Tang Doudou was so scared that she was stammering. Panicking, she leaned back against the tree and tried to find a safe place.</p><br/><p>My holy yoyo ah! Didn\u2019t they agree that there wouldn\u2019t be any life-threatening danger?</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai ah, Xiao Bai! You\u2019ll troll me to death at this rate!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She hastily washed up, then shoved the book into her clothes and followed the line of people out of Propitious Clouds Inn.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t known how many people Baili Yu had brought here so now that they all came out, she felt a little torn between laughing and crying. Had Baili Yu moved his entire family here?</p><br/><p>And this was even after the group with luggage left yesterday!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced over the scene and saw there were about a hundred guards and about twenty to thirty maids and servant girls. Then she spotted Meng Yu in the group.</p><br/><p>No wonder she had felt that the food tasted familiar. So it turned out that they had been cooked by Meng Yu!</p><br/><p>She was about to go over to say hello when a faint fragrance came from behind her and a moment later, she was encircled by a warm, large embrace. A familiar, languid voice drifted into her ear. \u201cWife, did you sleep well last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, pretty well!\u201d She looked up at him, puzzled. Why did he suddenly ask about this?</p><br/><p>Upon sensing her gaze, Baili Yu looked down and gently rubbed his chin against her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019ve slept well. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he wrapped his arm lightly around her waist and started walking towards the carriage that was stopped outside the inn.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou only noticed when they got to the carriage that Jun Xin, who had said that they wouldn\u2019t be going together, was currently sitting outside the carriage with his legs crossed.</p><br/><p>It was clear that he had lied again yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead and get on.\u201d While she was spacing out, Baili Yu patted her shoulder and had her get on first.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about you?\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to go with her? Tang Doudou was a little surprised.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu flicked the tip of her nose, then leaned over and softly kissed her cheek. \u201cFor the sake of protecting your pure reputation, this husband can only force himself to endure the pain of parting with Wife for half a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou blushed slightly. There were so many people around! Didn\u2019t he say that he was taking into consideration her pure reputation!? It was seriously too scary! It was a good thing that there were two carriages because if there had only been one\u2026 She didn\u2019t dare to continue thinking along those lines and hastily pushed Baili Yu aside to climb onto the carriage.</p><br/><p>However, because the carriage was too high, she couldn\u2019t get on even after several attempts. Just as she was pouting and getting annoyed, a hand stretched out towards her from above, accompanied by an impatient voice, \u201cYou\u2019re seriously stupid. Hurry and get on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently cursed and was just about to put her hand in his when her body suddenly lifted into the air. By the time she came back to her senses, she had already gotten into the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, be good, alright? This husband will come keep Wife company as soon as we leave the city.\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s eyes were smiling but also filled with silent warning as he glanced towards her hand.</p><br/><p>The meaning was very clear: Don\u2019t get so close to other men or he\u2019d get angry!</p><br/><p>Seriously, jealous men shouldn\u2019t be provoked!</p><br/><p>She glanced over to look at the little brat and softly grumbled, \u201cPetty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Baili Yu narrowed his eyes and glanced towards Jun Xin meaningfully. \u201cAh Xin, why don\u2019t you switch with Feng Long and ride in my carriage after all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin immediately pushed Tang Doudou into the carriage and replied coldly, \u201cNo need!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he swung the whip in his hand to drive the horse forward. Tang Doudou, who was inside the carriage, had just gotten up from the floor dizzily but was thrown right back down again by inertia. As she lay flat on the floor, she felt like the buns in front of her chest had been completely squashed and fiery pain transmitted from them. She really wanted to head out and kick the brat outside flying.</p><br/><p>The carriage had rushed grandly out of Cloud City. Tang Doudou lifted the carriage curtain and turned to look towards the city gates. She was a little disappointed that Su Yi didn\u2019t come to see her off.</p><br/><p>However, it occurred to her that he might be busy investigating the assassins, so she simply sighed. She was about to let down the curtain and head back into the carriage when Jun Xin glanced at her and grabbed her by her clothing. \u201cLook towards the city gate tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know why he said that, she still looked behind them again. She could barely make out the figure on the tower, but she still recognized Su Yi with one glance.</p><br/><p>Seeming to sense her gaze, Su Yi waved towards her. Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t see his expression, but her nose still stung and she felt about to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you guys are parting forever, don\u2019t weep endlessly. You\u2019ll get even uglier.\u201d Jun Xin pulled her back with a disdainful expression on his face. \u201cAre you trying to commit suicide, to lean that far out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if it\u2019s that easy to fall down. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m dumb, I know to hold on!\u201d Jun Xin was seriously too hateful. If he was going to be this way, then he shouldn\u2019t have told her where Su Yi was!</p><br/><p>When she looked back again, Su Yi was already gone.</p><br/><p>She sat down, disappointed. \u201cI don\u2019t even know when we\u2019ll meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin laughed, then rubbed her hair. \u201cDon\u2019t make such a miserable face, it\u2019s seriously ugly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking you to look!\u201d Tang Doudou was in a very bad mood and hit his hand aside hard. \u201cI want some space, don\u2019t bother me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Doudou,\u201d called Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s eyes flickered slightly and he spoke his sincere words in a joking manner, \u201cWhen you get married, remember to invite me to the feast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did he suddenly bring this up all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t invite you? What would you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

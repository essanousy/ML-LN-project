She listened to what people were saying and was stunned. Someone else had called out a price.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe price that Sir stated is ten thousand taels? Is that right?\u201d Qing Cheng\u2019s jaw dropped again. It was unbelievable that a courtesan\u2019s first night had gone for ten thousand taels.</p><br/><p>Someone was competing with her? Tang Doudou looked around but didn\u2019t see anyone.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone was looking around for the person that had declared this price, Lin Shuxuan\u2019s voice came from upstairs. It trembled a bit. \u201cY-yes! Ten thousand taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the eldest young master of the Lin Clan Stronghold, no wonder he\u2019s so liberal with his money,\u201d someone said.</p><br/><p>However, someone else immediately refuted, \u201cEven if he\u2019s the young master of the Lin Clan Stronghold, there\u2019s still no way he could be this liberal. Ten thousand taels is probably more than his annual spending money!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight!? Could it be that Young Master Lin has a grudge against this person and is picking a fight on purpose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the crowd became noisy with speculations, Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. Based on Lin Shuxuan\u2019s temperament, there was no way that he would have done something so rash.</p><br/><p>In addition, his voice was trembling as he called out this price. Although he tried to sound calm, his voice had betrayed his nervousness.</p><br/><p>Thus, Tang Doudou was certain that there was someone else in Lin Shuxuan\u2019s private room!</p><br/><p>She glanced towards the stage at Baili Yu and discovered that he was also looking towards her with a frown. Had he guessed it as well?</p><br/><p>Did this count as having linked hearts?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled happily, then kicked Lian er.</p><br/><p>Lian er looked up at her in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall out a price.\u201d She wasn\u2019t planning on paying the bill anyways, so she might as well call the price higher!</p><br/><p>Lian er was astonished. It was already at ten thousand taels. This guest wanted to make it even higher?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much should I add?\u201d asked Lian er.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. It couldn\u2019t be too much, otherwise it\u2019d seem fake. No matter how rich a person was, he still wouldn\u2019t spend money like water on a courtesan.</p><br/><p>Her eyes lit up with a thought. They wouldn\u2019t spend it on a courtesan, but they would spend it due to a different reason.</p><br/><p>She lifted her foot but didn\u2019t kick again. Instead, she leaned forward and shot Lian er a crafty look as she said, \u201cNo matter how much that person increases the price, call out a price that\u2019s one tael higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne tael?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I can\u2026\u201d Lian er looked at Tang Doudou weirdly. This guest was probably annoyed with the person that suddenly showed up, otherwise, why would he add onto the price tael by tael? He was definitely doing this on purpose because he was annoyed that someone was trying to snatch the goods out of his hands.</p><br/><p>As Lian er came to this conclusion, he glanced nervously at Qing gongzi.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur master bids ten thousand and one taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty thousand taels!\u201d shouted Lin Shuxuan.</p><br/><p>Lian er followed Tang Doudou\u2019s instructions. \u201cTwenty thousand and one taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirty thousand taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirty thousand and one taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cA hundred thousand taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA hundred thousand and one taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>The price was getting higher and higher. Once it hit a hundred thousand taels, every increase caused people to gasp.</p><br/><p>Some smart people had already come to the conclusion that the two were bidding due to annoyance rather than for obtaining Escort Xue.</p><br/><p>Most people were wondering if the two actually had the money to pay this bid.</p><br/><p>After all, who would bring several hundred thousand taels with them to visit a brothel? It would take days just to count those banknotes.</p><br/><p>Qing Cheng was the most worried out of them all. At first, he had been dazed by this sudden blessing, but gradually, the happiness turned to worry. It couldn\u2019t be that these two were here to purposefully cause trouble, right?</p><br/><p>He knew that Lin Shuxuan was pretty good friends with Tang Longbiao since he had never seen Lin Shuxuan treat anyone this well before.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t have planned this ahead of time to ruin Escort Xue\u2019s first night, right!?</p><br/><p>But the more he thought about it, the more likely this seemed. Still, he didn\u2019t dare to voice any objections. Even if this was ninety-nine percent true, he didn\u2019t want to lose that one percent chance of it not being true.</p><br/><p>Thus, he took advantage of this time while the audience was distracted to go backstage.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo see what\u2019s happening in Young Master Lin\u2019s private room!\u201d Qing Cheng hastily gave this instruction.</p><br/><p>As of now, a lot of people were curious and had wanted to go take a look at what was happening, so as soon as Qing Chen said this, someone responded and rushed to the private room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you guys shouldn\u2019t stay here either. Go outside and attend to the masters. Make sure to make them happy, don\u2019t let this incident ruin our reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the courtesans left, Jin Yi walked in through a small door at the side. \u201cQing gongzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Cheng saw that Jin Yi seemed abnormally calm, so he asked, \u201cJin Yi, do you know something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yi nodded. \u201cQing gongzi, just proceed normally. The owner is with Young Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Cheng was struck with realization, but he was also made more confused. \u201cWhat is the owner trying to do?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

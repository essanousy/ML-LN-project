His eyes darkened, then he asked, \u201cHave you finished the arrangements for tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI went this afternoon to give them instructions, so now they\u2019re just waiting for you to head over,\u201d said Ah Cai with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had gotten very familiar with Hibiscus Garrison\u2019s nightlife these past few days. It was extremely lively. It only took her a few moments to reach Wind Cherishing House. When she saw that there were streams of people entering the building, she rubbed her chin in thought. After tidying up her clothes and making sure her mustache was in place, she followed the stream of people in.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t understand why this male brothel was doing even better than traditional brothels.</p><br/><p>Could it be that there were that many people who liked men?</p><br/><p>However, she soon found out that she was wrong.</p><br/><p>After those people entered the building, they went and sat down in the main hall. The hall was decorated more exquisitely than the last time she had been here. After the guests sat down, some called for boys to accompany them, but many had brought pretty women of their own. They seemed quite familiar with each other since there was a lot of laughter as they conversed.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced upstairs and saw that Qing gongzi was standing in the corridor while watching these guests.</p><br/><p>He seemed to have sensed her gaze as he looked over. When he saw that it was her, he greeted her with a slight smile.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was confused by his polite attitude since she had clearly annoyed him during her last visit. Why was he greeting her like they were familiar old friends?</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly it was, so after mulling over it a while, she stopped thinking about it and went upstairs.</p><br/><p>Two male courtesans immediately walked up to block her way. \u201cApologies, Sir, we\u2019re not taking any guests upstairs today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at them and saw that one of the courtesans was the one called Lian er. Her expression darkened and she said, \u201cLian er, it seemed that your Qing gongzi hasn\u2019t punished you enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian er had felt that this guest seemed familiar from his first glance, so with this prompt, he immediately recalled who this guest was. His handsome little face paled a little and he said timidly, \u201cSo it was Sir Tang. Lian er didn\u2019t block your way on purpose, so please don\u2019t take offense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gave a disdainful humph and pushed him aside to head upstairs.</p><br/><p>Lian er didn\u2019t dare to try and stop her. When the other courtesan saw Lian er\u2018s fearful reaction, he didn\u2019t dare to block this guest either. Thus, Tang Doudou was able to quickly make it up the stairs and reach Qing gongzi.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing gongzi, I trust you\u2019ve been well!\u201d Tang Doudou faked a smile as she cupped her fist towards Qing gongzi.</p><br/><p>Qing gongzi had shifted his gaze away after that initial glance, so he was actually quite surprised to hear this guest\u2019s voice. He hadn\u2019t expected for this person to run directly up to him.</p><br/><p>He glanced towards the stairs. When he saw Lian er looking towards him fearfully, he shifted his gaze away and looked towards Tang Doudou. \u201cTang gongzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t seem to have told you guys about my name. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it was Escort Xue that told me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like that.\u201d Tang Doudou smiled, then she stared into this eyes as she asked, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, this guest was here for him.</p><br/><p>After silently remarking that, Qing gongzi\u2018s expression turned regretful. \u201cEscort Xue is indisposed today and won\u2019t be able to entertain any guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou heard that, she asked worriedly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him? Is it serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not serious, it\u2019s not anything relating to his health.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what is it about?\u201d Tang Doudou naturally intended to get a clear answer. She felt that it was best to make Qing gongzi feel that she was infatuated with Baili Yu so that it would be easier for her to see him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Tang gongzi really doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou asked curiously, \u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then her words took a shift. \u201cThese past few days, I kept getting dragged around by Young Master Lin so I didn\u2019t have the chance to come visit. Is he angry with me because of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing gongzi hastily shook his head. \u201cHow could the boys here dare to be angry with the gracious guests? That\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what is it? Just tell me already!\u201d Tang Doudou feigned anger.</p><br/><p>Qing gongzi pointed downstairs. \u201cTang gongzi has probably noticed that Wind Cherishing House is full of guests today. They\u2019re all here for Escort Xue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was taken aback. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing gongzi chuckled and said, \u201cIf Sir truly does like Escort Xue, why don\u2019t you take a seat downstairs? As long as Sir has enough money\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish his words and just glanced at her meaningfully. The meaning was clear. Fudge, Baili Yu was about to take the stage!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou followed a boy that was serving as the guide and found a good seat. She sat down to wait for her husband to appear on stage\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

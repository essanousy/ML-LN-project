He seemed about forty years old. He was wearing a gray-blue garment and looked very ordinary, like someone who would easily disappear into a crowd. \u201cYour Majesty suspects that Second Majesty was the one who did this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of whether he\u2019s responsible, we can\u2019t let the Saint Envoy target Yi er,\u201d said Xi Qiulin with a long sigh. No matter what, outsiders were outsiders and his son was his son. Regardless of how great the internal strife between them, he had emergency measures in place for when it was time for him, this father, to step out to protect them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be that simple. This is a Saint Envoy that can read hearts. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no way to deceive him with ordinary schemes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Fu, do you have any good ideas?\u201d Xi Qiulin rubbed the sides of his eyes to alleviate his headache.</p><br/><p>The person dressed in livid, who had been addressed as Old Fu, took a few moments to think. \u201cLet\u2019s call Second Majesty first and hear what he has to say. However, I dare to say that he\u2019s definitely involved in this matter. Lately, he has been walking too closely with that Elder Yu from the Alliance Head Residence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Fu\u2019s words made intensified Xi Qiulin\u2019s headache. \u201cThat idiot. I already warned him not to walk too close to those Jianghu people, yet he just insists on not listening. Now it\u2019s just great, the issue has gotten so large that it\u2019s ripping through the basket.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Majesty can\u2019t be blamed. That Elder Yu is notorious for being a wily old fox that\u2019s full of craft and cunning. Second Majesty is young, so it\u2019s hard for him not to be poisoned. However, Your Majesty, are you really going to help Second Majesty get rid of the Crown Prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Qiulin was silent for a long while before he said, \u201cThe Crown Prince is compassionate and lenient, he\u2019s not suitable for being a monarch. Though Yi er is full of youthful vigor and easily errs, he\u2019s the most suited to becoming a monarch out of all the princes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be simply because he\u2019s ruthless enough?\u201d Old Fu asked with a strange tone.</p><br/><p>The two had been close friends for several decades, so Xi Qiulin naturally understood his worry. He laughed helplessly. \u201cOld Fu, could it be that you\u2019ve forgotten how I came to be? Sovereign kings who are compassionate will never be good monarchs. This was the first sentence my Imperial Father had said to me back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Fu also fell silent as he looked at Xi Qiulin. \u201cHe was probably talking about himself, wasn\u2019t he? Back then, if it had been Princess Consort Baili\u2019s (aka wangfei, the main consort of a \u2018prince\u2019) bloodline that inherited the throne, perhaps he might still be living well right now rather than be in his current situation of hovering between life and death.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Princess Consort Baili was brought up, Xi Qiulin closed his eyes and said in a heavy voice, \u201cEnough. Just let these things fade into the past. Baili Yu hasn\u2019t displayed any intentions of seizing the throne, so we should just avoid provoking him. For now, hurry and find that annoying Li Xueyi and send him back to quell the Saint Envoy\u2019s anger. Otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was filled with worry. Upon hearing it, Old Fu lowered his eyes and asked in a quiet voice, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that Your Majesty hasn\u2019t suspected Li Xueyi before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuspect him of what? He\u2019s just a rascal that causes trouble for no reason. If it weren\u2019t for the warning Baili Yu sent, I would\u2019ve already sent people to tear apart that rotten Alliance Head Residence of his!\u201d When Li Xueyi was brought up, Xi Qiulin\u2019s anger rushed out all at once. He barely had a handful of days to relax ever since this person showed up. If it wasn\u2019t that he was alarmed by some news about him that he couldn\u2019t sleep today, it would be that he was frightened by some other news about him so much that he didn\u2019t dare to sleep tomorrow. In short, he felt like that Li Xueyi was an evil comet! He would definitely seize any chance to get rid of him!</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, Xi Qiulin was so preoccupied with those thoughts that he didn\u2019t notice the most suspicious thing about Li Xueyi.</p><br/><p>It was such an obvious incongruency, yet he didn\u2019t notice it. As expected, he had gotten old!</p><br/><p>Old Fu thought this in his heart but didn\u2019t say it out loud. He planned to have a proper talk with Xi Qiulin about this after this matter was settled. The current circumstances were already out of their control.</p><br/><p>The darkness surged up violently around her. Tang Doudou kept waiting, but Xi Qiuyi never appeared.</p><br/><p>Could it be that he had choked to death on water?</p><br/><p>Or did he fall into the latrine and drown?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou made random malicious guesses. It wasn\u2019t that she was looking forward to Xi Qiuyi arriving, but that waiting like this was torture.</p><br/><p>It was pitch-black all around, but she kept feeling like someone was watching her.</p><br/><p>Her back was covered with cold sweat and all her hair was standing on end.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Who\u2019s there?\u201d Finally, she couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and cried out at the darkness.</p><br/><p>The only reply she got was the echoes of the room, causing her to feel even more terrified.</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, this interrogation room was custom designed to deal psychological torment on people.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if it was effective on past criminals, it was very effective on her. She seemed to feel a cold wind blowing over the back of her neck. She instantly froze and didn\u2019t dare to move.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even dare to breathe loudly.</p><br/><p>Da fudge? Could it be that ghosts really existed in this world?</p><br/><p>Was the ghost that was blowing on her back a soul that was tormented to death in this interrogation room?</p><br/><p>\u201cU-um, chivalrous hero, my dear friend, bro, you were killed by that second prince, Xi Qiuyi, right? Actually, I-I\u2019m also a victim. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look. I\u2019m all tied up. As people that fell from the sky together, why don\u2019t we peacefully sit down and have some tea while we chat? Appearing in such a chilling way like this is a b-bit scary ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro? Or is it Big Sis? Taking into account how sincere I\u2019m being, could you stop blowing on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you switch to blowing in the front?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe top is fine too ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, don\u2019t do it from the back. It\u2019s really scary\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dare to turn around and look. All she could do was ramble nonsense in order to distract herself and give herself courage.</p><br/><p>The more she acted that way, the stronger the blowing sound became. Earlier, it was just a slight air movement, but now it completely sounded like a blowing sound!</p><br/><p>She shuddered. She had been telling herself that it was just wind, but this distinct sound was seriously making her want to \u2018go die\u2019!</p><br/><p>Freaking yoyo!</p><br/><p>I-it really is a ghost!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a ghost!\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and started screaming as she struggled against the iron rings frantically. However, they were too secure. She couldn\u2019t struggle free without using inner strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich fricking idiot designed these damned things!?\u201d Tang Doudou was about to cry from anxiety. She kept struggling without daring to glance back. All the supernatural novels she read before said something about there being three lamps on a person\u2019s shoulder. (There\u2019s different interpretations but a simple one is: past, present, and future.) At night when you\u2019re out walking and you feel someone blowing on your neck, you must not turn back. The moment you turn back, one of the lamps on your shoulder will go out.</p><br/><p>The more Tang Doudou thought about it, the more frightened she became and she hastily threw this thought out of her head as she shouted, \u201cHey! Is there anyone outside!? Save me ah! There\u2019s a ghost!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, though her voice traveled far, there was no response.</p><br/><p>Fuuu\u2026</p><br/><p>Could it be that after dodging so many calamities, she was going to die at the hands of a ghost?</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>F*ck it all!</p><br/><p>She was going to die in any case so she should at least see what a ghost looks like before she dies! That way at least she wouldn\u2019t have ran into this misfortune for nothing!</p><br/><p>Once one mustered up their resolution, one no longer has any fear!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou slowly turned around. She couldn\u2019t help but gulp and her heart pounded like a drum. Fudge, what she said about not being nervous just a lie to the ghost, alright?</p><br/><p>She looked around but didn\u2019t see anything. She turned around until her neck was almost about to snap from being twisted. Just as she was about to turn back, she abruptly saw a black figure appear behind her!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At that moment, when Tang Doudou drank that cup of wine laced with Tendons Softening Powder, he had already sent someone to acquire the Alliance Head Command Tablet. Now, he\u2019d like to see where Bai Feiyun would shake out an Alliance Head Command Tablet from. If he couldn\u2019t bring it out, then don\u2019t blame him for being vicious and merciless!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Originally, he wanted to directly poison Li Xueyi and completely get rid of him, but Godly Doctor Cang Baicao was currently present in Cloud City. If it were to be discovered by any chance, and if the Lord of Cloud City held him accountable, he\u2019d have to accompany Li Xueyi to the grave. They might even dig out the private transactions he had with the Demonic Sect, therefore he only sent someone to disguise as one of the girls of Rutaceae Pavilion and take the Alliance Head Command Tablet. Whether he could be beaten or not, there was still the plan. Even if Li Xueyi escaped from Mu Ye\u2019s demonic hands, if he wasn\u2019t able to take out the Alliance Head Command Tablet, he still can\u2019t ascend the Alliance Head position. At the same time, he could also conveniently influence the status Bai Feiyun had in the Jianghu negatively.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Although the plan was perfect, developments will always have twists and turns. However, in the end, it will still return to within his grasp. Everything will go toward the results he wishes for, so the earlier displeasure had already become of little importance.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Pondering to this point, Elder Yu\u2019s bunched up brows finally relaxed. As long as he was able to get rid of Li Xueyi, then he could have someone to expose even more ugly matters related to Li Xueyi and Cloud City. Henceforth if Cloud City wants to control the Martial Arts Circles once again, it would be difficult!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Using some more methods later on, won\u2019t this Alliance Head position still become an item within his pocket?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>He had waited for many years already, so he didn\u2019t care about this small amount of time.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun already knew that Elder Yu had been scheming for a long time. Originally, he didn\u2019t want to push out Li Xueyi this soon either, but it\u2019s all that guy\u2019s fault for insisting on saying that the dried fruits he had personally mixed tasted bad. He even disdainfully said that those dried fruits didn\u2019t deserve to be called the signature specialty of Rutaceae Pavilion. In a moment of irritation, he called him by his identity. Otherwise, he would\u2019ve just waited a little longer and allowed Elder Yu to reveal his true nature before jumping out and taking advantage of Elder Yu\u2019s panic to take control of the situation and introduce the person. At that time, whether he had the Alliance Head Command Tablet or not, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered anymore.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Yet, things had broken away from his control. After Li Xueyi was thrown out, he immediately provoked Elder Yu and even climbed to such a high place, attracting everyone\u2019s attention. Wasn\u2019t this just self induced embarrassment?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>He even thought that guy had some means to respond, looks like he overestimated him.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Besides, talking about Tang Doudou, how could she possibly know how complicated this time period was? She thought that as long as she stood up, this Alliance Head position was hers to sit on!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Da fudge she actually needs some Alliance Head Command Tablet before she can take the position?!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It\u2019s seriously fraud! It sounds nice, Alliance Head da ren*, commander of the Jianghu, roaring big talk! In actuality, it\u2019s a poor pressured waiter that has to clock in and out of work ah! </p><br/><p>\u201cda ren\u201d Sir/Madam. A suffix used for an official or a person in authority.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t the Alliance Head Command Tablet precisely akin to a worker\u2019s card?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In the past, she hadn\u2019t brought her worker card and ended up acting cute in front of her company. Just by dropping her moral principles, she was able to mingle her way in and make up for it next time.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This time, she didn\u2019t bring the Alliance Head Command Tablet, but could she also use the same tricks?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Smack!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She slapped this unrealistic idea flying with a palm. Tang Doudou supported her head with her hand. Heavens my lord, shouldn\u2019t you use something to rescue poor little Beanbeans?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>On the tall stage, she could see everyone\u2019s hopeful gazes with just a single glance. Seeing this, Tang Doudou started to regret.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>For what reason did she climb so high, when she had nothing to do?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the Alliance Head saying anything? Where\u2019s the Alliance Head Command Tablet? It couldn\u2019t be that the Alliance Head forgot to bring it, right?\u201d Elder Yu\u2019s grating voice once again sounded. The corners of his mouth tilted, almost unable to hang up the pleased expression over his entire face.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Tang Doudou\u2019s teeth itched ah! Teeth itch!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This old SOB, she\u2019ll sort him out sooner or later!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s heart sank. Seeing that Bai Feiyun\u2019s face was also showing panic, she realized that she could only rely on herself to think of a solution right now.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Either admit that the Alliance Head Command Tablet was lost, or refuse to admit that she forget the Alliance Head Command Tablet to the grave.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou unhurriedly got up as she slightly controlled the expression in her eyes, she even dusted off her front lapel before she lifted her head. When she looked down and faced the entire audience, her expression had already returned to normal.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yu is surely joking, how could ben zuo forget to bring such an important item?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that right? Then why is Alliance Head so reluctant to take out the Alliance Head Command Tablet?\u201d Elder Yu narrowed his eyes into a curve. He didn\u2019t think that Li Xueyi would still hold on even when things had developed to such a point. He saw Bai Feiyun\u2019s helpless expression, it was clear that the mountains and rivers were exhausted, they had reached the end of the line and still refused to admit it. He really couldn\u2019t help but be forced to give admiration, this person\u2019s face sure is thick enough!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yu is joking again. Why must I take out the Alliance Head Command Tablet?\u201d Tang Doudou casted a sidelong glance at Elder Yu. He himself had also said that the Alliance Head Command Tablet was only used when commanding Jianghu, didn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Starting this martial arts convention, everyone was just here to gossip, pat butts and chat idly, what\u2019s the use of a command tablet? It wasn\u2019t like they were immediately going to gather people to subjugate the Demonic Sect\u2019s old nest!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This Elder Yu simply wanted to make it so she had no way of being the Alliance Head! He had forgotten though, even though he didn\u2019t want it in his heart, but in practice every word he said recognized her position as Alliance Head. Since he\u2019d already recognized it, the only option he had was to use his own palm to slap himself and say that she, Tang Doudou, was not Alliance Head, not Li Xueyi. Otherwise, this mouthful of Jinkela*, even if he, Elder Yu must hold in his tears, he must finish eating!</p><br/><p>Jinkela is a chemical fertilizer additive brand a strong local flavor. They invited foreign actors to shoot some ridiculous patriotic video to advertise so it ended up being mocked a lot on the internet.</p><br/><p>The moment Tang Doudou said this, Elder Yu\u2019s facial color slightly changed. He wasn\u2019t dumb, since Tang Doudou was able to think of it, he naturally was also able realize it!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This time, it really was lifting up a rock to smash on his own foot!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But he wasn\u2019t one to be fooled easily, and immediately said: \u201cAs I\u2019ve already mentioned to Bai gongzi just now, since Alliance Head had just arrived, not knowing the customs of martial arts conventions is also quite normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThen may I venture to ask Elder Yu, who exactly was it that laid down this custom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally it was\u2026\u201d Elder Yu had just begun to reply when his facial colour sank downwards again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWas who?\u201d Tang Doudou pursued her question.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Elder Yu moved his lips, anger flashing through his eyes. His patience was almost completely used up!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThe martial arts convention customs are all set by the Lord of Cloud City, isn\u2019t that so, Elder Yu?\u201d Bai Feiyun finally saw Tang Doudou\u2019s intention. He really underestimated him, he didn\u2019t think that he was still able to discover this opportunity to live from within Elder Yu\u2019s words at such a moment. Looks like Cloud City allowing him to become the Alliance Head wasn\u2019t completely without reason.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Elder Yu bitterly swept his gaze back towards Bai Feiyun and spat out the words between the gaps in his teeth: \u201cIt was indeed set by the City Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s right, ah!\u201d Tang Doudou cheerfully clapped her hands and ran off the high stage to stand with Bai Feiyun: \u201cJust then I was in too much of a hurry, I almost forgot about the matter which the City Lord had assigned!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did the City Lord assign Alliance Head?\u201d Seeing her fly over like a little bird that escaped from a cage, her expression seemingly wanting to jump and leap, Bai Feiyun slightly smiled and naturally continued her words.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou patted her chest and craftily winked: \u201cOf course it\u2019s related to the Martial Arts Circles, a big happy matter that\u2019ll benefit the entire Jianghu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hearing that it was a big happy matter, everyone\u2019s attention was immediately sucked towards this topic. Tang Doudou walked down and got surrounded by the others. One person would pass on a remark, the other would pass on a sentence. They all wanted to fish out the information of this so-called big happy matter from Tang Doudou. They were curious as to what this matter truly was.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Where did they still have the attention to care about Elder Yu\u2019s matter regarding her being in possession of the Alliance Head Command Tablet?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Who asked Elder Yu to have never questioned Tang Doudou\u2019s identity from the very start, and in doing so affirm it? Due to that, now they felt that Elder Yu was purposefully bringing up the matter with the Alliance Head Command Tablet to put Tang Doudou in a difficult position. It simply did not occur to anyone to question whether the person in front of them was actually Li Xueyi!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>So, when they heard that the Lord of Cloud City had even given Li Xueyi an assignment, they were even more certain of this person in front of them. It must be known that no one in Jianghu had such a nerve, leaving aside the matter of pretending to be the Alliance Head, no one would dare to create a rumor involving the Lord of Cloud City ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yiyun had spoken disrespectfully and even exposed quite a lot of behind-the-scenes stories earlier, they were all things that had been rumored on the Jianghu before, it was just that there were no definite news!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Without wind, there cannot be waves, the human way of thinking was simply this strange. After getting used to being led around by people, they are ones who would follow the herd.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>At this time, Tang Doudou\u2019s words easily convinced them again without a doubt. The Lord of Cloud City was willing to entrust such a heavy responsibility to Li Xueyi, who would believe that these two really didn\u2019t have anything between them?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>If Li Xueyi was the Lord of Cloud City\u2019s darling, then they must take even greater care not to offend!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Yiyun originally wanted to expose the Lord of Cloud City\u2019s scandals, he never expected that it became an ironclad proof which ultimately caused everyone to believe Li Xueyi\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing everyone\u2019s attention starting to deviate again, Elder Yu wanted to curse ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Next to him, Xiao Yiyun\u2019s facial colour was quickly becoming almost the same colour as Elder Yu\u2019s thick beard. Giving a faint cough, he said something to Elder Yu. The latter nodded, and Xiao Yiyun took the chance to run off while no one was paying attention.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Although Tang Doudou was laughing along with those people, her attention never left Elder Yu and Xiao Yiyun. The moment she saw Xiao Yiyun run off, she sent a meaningful glance towards Bai Feiyun. The latter nodded slightly and also slipped away.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Naturally this was go block Xiao Yiyun\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>As for whether he can obstruct him or not, Tang Doudou could only burn incense and pray to Buddha, sending a prayer to all parties!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She actually quite believed in Bai Feiyun\u2019s ability though. If he didn\u2019t have some tricks, why would Elder Yu keep targeting Bai Feiyun? And also always expose a helpless look?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Even now, when he saw Bai Feiyun head out to chase, his gaze swept over to her like a knife. Tang Doudou naturally met it fearlessly. The two gazes crackled in the air, in the end it was Tang Doudou who triumphed. Elder Yu lowered his eyes and gave a cold humph, then turned away and refrained from looking at her any longer.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Small fry! Tang Doudou proudly humphed and turned towards an auntie that was tugging at her: \u201cThe topic is of great importance. The City Lord\u2019s intention is to wait until I\u2019m steady before announcing it. So you guys shouldn\u2019t be so impatient either. As soon as this Li finishes settling the current matters, this Li will immediately explain to everyone about this! It will definitely be completely clear!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she patted her chest \u2018pah pah pah\u2019 in a completely unartificial manner, immediately attracting a good impression for everyone.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Having such a friendly Alliance Head was also pretty good ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Of course, within them were also quite a few of Elder Yu\u2019s supporters that had not stopped giving cold humphs the entire time. From time to time, they still threw in some cynical sentences.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Certainly, Tang Doudou\u2019s mouth spared even less mercy when facing these kind of people. She immediately angered them to the point where their noses flared and their eyes glared, resulting in them displacing to the side to cool down.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The scene was incomparably harmonious for a time. Seeing that it was about time, continuing to dawdle would probably only cause more unforeseen events. Thus, Tang Doudou extended her hands and gestured down as she earnestly said: \u201cIt\u2019s already late, everyone can go to whatever they need to attend to. We\u2019ll continue this martial arts convention tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! What is there that you can\u2019t clearly say today? So much that it must be pushed off to tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right ah. There has never been the custom of pushing things to a later time in previous martial arts conventions!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hearing that she wanted to end the convention, the guys that were cooling off on the side didn\u2019t even wait for Elder Yu\u2019s instructions before exploding their feathers.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, you\u2019ve only just taken up the position and you\u2019ve consecutively changed two customs. Are you not afraid that the City Lord will rebuke you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOr do you hold special favor so you can act as recklessly as you please, thus not having to take the Martial Arts Circles Fellowship seriously?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Yoyoyo!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Witnessing this crowd of guys that seemed to be filled with righteous indignation at the injustice, Tang Doudou gaped then closed her mouth silently. Looks like wanting to cleanly and flawlessly end this martial arts convention is really not possible ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When she was halfway up, Mu Ye couldn\u2019t stop himself from reminding her, \u201cUse qinggong.\u201d</p><br/><p>She always ended up forgetting that she knew qinggong.</p><br/><p>When she gradually got near the end of the ladder, she leaped up and landed on a branch nearby.</p><br/><p>\u201cWah, does this still count as a tree? It\u2019s way too magical!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou stood on the enormous tree branch. The beautiful scene above her was completely different from what was below her. Rainbow-colored leaves glowed with faint radiance like the immortal trees of the legends.</p><br/><p>There were all sorts of fruits hanging in between those leaves. Their colors were all very bright and as far as the eye could see, no two were identical.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow magical!\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but sigh emotionally.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye nodded. \u201cNan Maner said that these fruits were really good, so I picked some.\u201d</p><br/><p>Could he not bring up this subject?</p><br/><p>Her tongue was still slightly numb right now!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, really? Have you eaten any?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d He was worried that she would be really hungry when she woke up so he immediately went down to give them to her as soon as he picked some.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was speechless. Suddenly, she saw a rainbow-colored leaf drop onto Mu Ye\u2019s shoulder. She reached over and picked it up. \u201cHow could rainbow-colored leaves exist? It really doesn\u2019t follow common sense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s related to the soil,\u201d said Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe soil?\u201d Tang Doudou was a good child of the new age and knew that the things required for plants to grow were not simply soil and sunlight.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t investigate deeply into this question because the question of how this tree became like this really didn\u2019t have much to do with her. She wasn\u2019t an explorer so she wasn\u2019t that interested in the reason why. Hence, she just gazed at it for a while. Once she looked enough, she said goodbye to Mu Ye and returned to her room to wait for Nan Maner to bring her food.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye watched until her head disappeared from view. Nan Maner had mentioned that the medicinal bath was made from these fruits, so he thought they would help her recover. Why did her facial color turn so bad when he brought them up?</p><br/><p>Could it be because the fruits didn\u2019t taste good?</p><br/><p>He pulled off a nearby fruit. After a moment of thought, he bit down. His cold expression instantly crumbled as a red flush crawled up his neck.</p><br/><p>He finally understood why Tang Doudou would make such an expression when looking at the fruits.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, they\u2019ve already been stuck on this crappy tree for three months.</p><br/><p>Filtered sunlight shone through the dense leaves. Tang Doudou was bored stiff as she lay on the tree, counting the days. She then gave a long sigh.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye was sitting not far from her, his expression the same as always.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, the Alliance Head and the Leader of the Demonic Sect disappeared at the same time for so long. The Jianghu has probably turned into porridge from the disorder by now, right?\u201d Tang Doudou smacked her lips, before suddenly speaking, as she looked towards the expressionless Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ll think that I took you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen search the entire country for our tracks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, they wouldn\u2019t find anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll definitely think that we took each other down! Haha!\u201d Tang Doudou started laughing. After interacting with Mu Ye for these past months, she discovered that this iceberg was actually only cold on the surface. At times, he was actually quite fun.</p><br/><p>But it was seriously thanks to her careful guidance!</p><br/><p>Three months ago, he only spat out one or two words at a time, but now he was already capable of carrying on random banter with her. She would even see a faint smile occasionally appear on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, Mu Ye, why do you always have such a serious expression? Isn\u2019t smiling like this great?\u201d Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye stopped smiling and glanced at her. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that there\u2019s anything amusing.\u201d</p><br/><p>She still had to decipher his words though. What this meant was that previously, his life was too dull and there wasn\u2019t a time when he was happy at all.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sat up and knitted her brows. \u201cCould it be that I look really funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, well, whatever.\u201d Tang Doudou lay back down again and looked at the rainbow-colored leaves above her. \u201cI really miss Xiao Bai, I really want to go back ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, she missed Baili Yu the most. It\u2019s been almost half a year since they\u2019ve seen each other.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know if he was searching the country for her or if he already had a new flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon now,\u201d said Mu Ye suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon now what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s tone was serious. His eyes were filled with worry as he looked towards Tang Doudou. \u201cShen Moru is almost back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he comes back then so be it. The earlier one dies, the earlier one reincarnates. If one dies sooner, one will be able to avoid the birth-control policy\u2026\u201d said Tang Doudou in a nonchalant manner. However, in truth, she was afraid. She didn\u2019t know what Shen Moru would do to her when he came back. Would he lock her up and drain her blood every day, or would he drain her dry in one go?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you\u2019re rather open-minded.\u201d Shen Moru\u2019s voice suddenly came from above their heads. He laughed in his usual strange way. \u201cIt\u2019d save me some effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sat up and looked around but didn\u2019t see Shen Moru.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs sneaking around pretending to be a ghost all you know to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Moru\u2019s \u2018jeje\u2019 laughter got closer. \u201cLittle girl, don\u2019t think you can act impudent just because I can\u2019t kill you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As the last word sounded, Shen Moru\u2019s figure also appeared in front of her. That same instant, his withered fingers made contact with Tang Doudou\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, if you dare then just choke me to death right now!\u201d Tang Doudou continued to be cheeky and didn\u2019t even look straight at Shen Moru.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, then you had better behave!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had already heard words like this countless times these past three months. She didn\u2019t pay attention to it at all. \u201cIf you want to kill me, do it more straightforwardly. I\u2019ve never seen a man that dawdled as much as you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, it will be as you wish soon!\u201d said Shen Moru darkly.</p><br/><p>He then released Tang Doudou\u2019s neck. No longer minding the two, he went down the ladder to find Grandma Shen.</p><br/><p>\u201cSicko!\u201d Tang Doudou cursed at his back, then looked towards Mu Ye. \u201cHow about you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah!!! If this won\u2019t do and that won\u2019t do, will I really have to accept this fate of being a blood source?\u201d Tang Doudou once again lay down on the tree branch. Her glistening eyes contained a secret scheme. Three months ago, she didn\u2019t have any way to deal with Shen Moru but three months later\u2026</p><br/><p>A faint smile appeared on her lips as she looked at the fruits above her.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

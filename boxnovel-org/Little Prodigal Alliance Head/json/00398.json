Why hadn\u2019t she ever heard of it? Wind cloud, it was wind cloud again. What relationship would it have with Wind Cloud Island?</p><br/><p>This person had gone to Flowing Clouds Manor and called Mu Qingyu by Yu er, so it was clear that they had a close relationship. It was also very likely that this person also belonged to Wind Cloud Island.</p><br/><p>Wind Cloud Island and the Seven Great Saint Tribes have always had a very incompatible relationship. If he was someone of Wind Cloud Island, why was he hanging out with Grandma Shen?</p><br/><p>The countless questions that popped up caused her tired brain to get a headache, so she decided to just not worry about it for the time being. Before, she was too hurt that Jun Xin had died and it only occurred to her now that she should hurry and find a doctor to check Jun Xin so she could find out if the revival pill was working.</p><br/><p>However, a normal doctor probably wouldn\u2019t even know what a revival pill is, much less the signs of whether it was effective.</p><br/><p>This made Tang Doudou\u2019s headache even worse. It seemed that she had no choice but to head back to Azure Water Valley and ask Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren to contact Cang Baicao!</p><br/><p>If she started rushing back now, she\u2019d probably be able to make it back here before night.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou\u2019s thoughts got to here, she didn\u2019t pause any longer and hastily got up to start running in the direction of the courtyard. When she got there, she didn\u2019t go in. Instead, she headed straight towards the stables and whistled, then Little Bell happily ran out.</p><br/><p>When he saw Tang Doudou, he intimately rubbed his head against her shoulder.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou patted Little Bell, then moved Jun Xin onto the horse before jumping up herself. She adjusted Jun Xin again to make sure that he wouldn\u2019t fall off before lifting the whip.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bell, to Azure Water Valley!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Bell lifted his hooves and shot out like he was flying. Soon, he reached the entrance of the garrison.</p><br/><p>The garrison gates had already closed and the guards on night patrol immediately blocked the way when they saw that a horse was rushing over. \u201cWho\u2019s there!? It\u2019s already passed curfew, do you have a warrant for leaving? Hurry and up turn back around!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, how could Tang Doudou possibly turn around?</p><br/><p>She quickly arrived in front of the guard. Her expression was solemn and a little displeased as she looked the guard up and down. \u201cThis alliance head has matters to deal with outside the city, hurry up and open the gates! If you end up delaying my work, even if the imperial court protects you, I\u2019ll still kill you guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the guards heard that it was her, their expressions rapidly changed and they moved aside. The leader hastily shouted, \u201cHurry and open the gates for Alliance Head Li!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he turned towards Tang Doudou and wiped at the sweat on his forehead. \u201cThis little one truly was blind to not know that you were the Alliance Head. Apologies for the offense earlier, I hope that Alliance Head will forgive this little one\u2019s mistake\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, before he could even finish speaking, Tang Doudou rushed out the moment the gates opened without even bothering to glance at the guard.</p><br/><p>The guard didn\u2019t show any annoyance at being ignored. He wiped his forehead again as he looked at the fading figure. This was the rumored Li Xueyi who was capable of killing without blinking an eye. It was fortunate that he had been able to react quickly enough earlier, otherwise he\u2019d probably already be dead.</p><br/><p>He sighed in relief and called for the guards to close the gates. As he turned, he saw a trace of white appear from an alley.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi?\u201d The guard was a little surprised to see that figure in white slowly walk over. Could it be that something had happened to the martial artists in Barbarian Mound Garrison? If not, why would Bai gongzi come here in the middle of the night? Tang Doudou had also been in a huge rush earlier\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWas the person that left just now Alliance Head Li?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReplying Bai gongzi, yes, it was Alliance Head Li!\u201d replied the guard honestly.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun nodded and didn\u2019t move to chase after her. Instead, he turned around and returned to the little garden in the courtyard. He gazed at the stone table that shone faintly from the moonlight for a while, then looked away and turned towards the empty garden. \u201cCome out. Have you carried out the task I left to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was completely quiet in the garden and there was no one visible in the areas lit up by moonlight. If someone had just randomly walked in, he\u2019d definitely wonder if there was something wrong with Bai Feiyun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Just as Bai Feiyun was getting a little annoyed at the hidden person, a grumbling voice suddenly came from the pitch black room. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier that Jun Xin also knew how to use poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>And JJX had even been able to poison him without a trace. Even he didn\u2019t have such skill.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun frowned slightly. \u201cHe poisoned you?\u201d</p><br/><p>That person replied in a depressed tone, \u201cIt\u2019d be good if it was just poison. I don\u2019t know what he used, but I can\u2019t even look at light anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was shocked. \u201cWhat poison is it? You actually can\u2019t cure it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only a few poisons that I can\u2019t cure and this is one.\u201d That person sighed. \u201cHowever, Jun Xin should already be dead now. The poison I used on him is absolutely fatal. When he left, the poison was already attacking his heart so he couldn\u2019t have lived for more than an hour.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs of now, his corpse is probably already cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>When that person got to here, his tone became more happy. So what if he had to live in darkness? At least he was still alive, while Jun Xin was already dead!</p><br/><p>However, Bai Feiyun asked, \u201cAre you sure that Jun Xin will die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrust?\u201d Bai Feiyun laughed coldly. \u201cHow could I trust you? You can\u2019t even handle a small matter like this properly and almost got yourself killed! If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I promised your master that I would look after you, you would already be dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d A moment later, the person\u2019s voice filled with shock. \u201cYou mean that Jun Xin is still alive? How\u2019s that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I went to look for Grandma Shen earlier, I encountered Tang Doudou on the way there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was leaving the garrison on horseback with Jun Xin. If my guess isn\u2019t wrong, she\u2019s heading back to Azure Water Valley. If Jun Xin was really dead, why would she waste the time and effort to head back to Azure Water Valley in the middle of the night with how dangerous the situation currently is? That mysterious person is still hidden somewhere nearby. She doesn\u2019t have such guts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis means that Jun Xin hasn\u2019t died yet? She\u2019s taking this risk to head back alone to Azure Water Valley in hopes of saving Jun Xin?\u201d That person quickly caught on to the situation. At the same time, fear filled his face. \u201cJun Xin is already that frightening? That\u2019s the top of the ten strangest poisons! It\u2019s already amazing that he was able to suppress the poison for so long so that he had time to find Tang Doudou, but if he even managed to survive\u2026 That\u2019s terrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t seem to agree. He just glanced briefly towards the darkness, then said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about these things for now, just head back. Once I finish dealing with these matters, I\u2019ll help you make an antidote.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all we can do now,\u201d said that person with a sigh.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

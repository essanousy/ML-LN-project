You wouldn\u2019t be able to do much anyways.\u201d Tang Doudou patted his shoulder and had him get up. \u201cI just want you to accompany me out, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOut?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, to Yuelai Inn.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was speaking, Gu Xun walked in.</p><br/><p>Lian er hastily curtsied towards Gu Xun. Gu Xun waved to dismiss him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Tang Doudou called out to stop Lian er, then she said to Gu Xun, \u201cIn a little while, Lian er will be heading out with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas Boss Gu come up with a way to help me get out?\u201d asked Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun sighed. \u201cThis is precisely why I came to talk to you. Alliance Head Li, perhaps you should consider sending someone after all. There\u2019s seriously no way to hide from the spies outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I have my own ways. If there\u2019s no way to hide from the spies, then just give up doing so and head right out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Xun tried to dissuade her. \u201cAlliance Head Li, we can\u2019t risk that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t joke with my life.\u201d Tang Doudou stood up and grabbed Lian er. \u201cDo you courtesans have any clothes that will fit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Lian er sized her up. \u201cAlliance Head Li\u2019s figure isn\u2019t that different from ours. You can probably fit into most of our garments.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Xun frowned. \u201cAlliance Head Li, this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, so I\u2019ll be borrowing Lian er for now. Boss Gu wouldn\u2019t happen to have objections, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is Lian er\u2018s fortune to be able to help Alliance Head Li.\u201d No emotions could be heard in Gu Xun\u2019s words, but his eyes were dark. He was clearly unhappy with her insistence in going out.</p><br/><p>However, that had nothing to do with her. She had to get the box containing the antidote to the Hoarfrost Poison personally!</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t even entrust Jun Xin to do it!</p><br/><p>With how reckless he was, what if he ended up breaking the things? Then it\u2019d be too late for regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian er, after you head out, make sure to look after Alliance Head Li with your life, understood?\u201d said Gu Xun.</p><br/><p>Lian er\u2018s shoulders trembled. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Lian er left the room together. As Gu Xun watched them, his gaze darkened. He had already sent someone to the inn to search her room, but they hadn\u2019t found anything.</p><br/><p>What exactly was she heading there to grab? Or was it that she was purposefully using this chance to do something else?</p><br/><p>Why was she taking Lian er with her?</p><br/><p>Gu Xun couldn\u2019t tell what Tang Doudou was thinking, so he went to Jin Yi and instructed, \u201cGet someone to tail them. I want to see what exactly she does.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, but, she\u2019ll definitely be able to guess that we sent someone after her, so she probably wouldn\u2019t do anything out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen allow her to shake you guys off.\u201d Gu Xun furrowed his brows. \u201cAnd, go check if there\u2019s any news from the Lin Clan Stronghold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou spent a long time picking out her outfit in Lian er\u2018s room. These courtesans only had garments that were white, blue, or pink\u2026</p><br/><p>The styles were pretty much all the same as well. Tang Doudou had no choice but to settle for a pink one. After putting it on, she borrowed Lian er\u2018s cosmetics to do a heavy smokey eye. She gazed at her flirtatious appearance in the copper mirror, then nodded in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Not even Baili Yu would be able to recognize her like this, much less those spies.</p><br/><p>Lian er was shocked by her appearance and his finger trembled as he said, \u201cAlliance Head Li, that makeup of your is truly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful, right?\u201d Tang Doudou turned around and winked towards him. \u201cLian er, come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked like a ghost. How was it anywhere close to beautiful?</p><br/><p>Even as Lian er refuted this silently, he kept a smile on his face. \u201cAlliance Head Li is naturally beautiful. No matter what you wear, you\u2019re still a beauty capable of overthrowing a city.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said with a smile, \u201cThis is called smokey eye makeup. Come here, I\u2019ll help do your makeup too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, there\u2019s no need for Alliance Head Li to go through that trouble.\u201d Lian er edged backwards.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled sweetly and made comere motion. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up! I don\u2019t have that much patience!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou\u2019s tone became angry, Lian er started and hastily said, \u201cI-I\u2019ll head over right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this makeup will make you seem like a vixen. Later I\u2019ll teach you a dance, I guarantee that you\u2019ll become the most desired courtesan in Wind Cherishing House!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lian er\u2018s face was filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, time is short so hurry up and come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian er couldn\u2019t understand what Tang Doudou was trying to do, but he couldn\u2019t disobey so he sat down.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou worked hard and soon applied smokey eye makeup to Lian er\u2018s eyes as well.</p><br/><p>After stepping back and taking in his sultry look, she finally put the cosmetics down in satisfaction. Then she pulled Lian er up to leave Wind Cherishing House.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, she pushed open the door and walked out.</p><br/><p>Hibiscus Garrison was just as lively at night as usual.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hugged Lian er\u2018s arm and said sweetly, \u201cBig Brother Lian er, where should we go to play tonight? It wasn\u2019t easy for us to finally get a holiday. If we don\u2019t play our fill, that\u2019d be wasting this chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian er was pretty clever and quickly caught on. \u201cAlright, where do you want to go? I\u2019ll keep you company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeehee, Big Brother Lian er, you\u2019re the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them continued chatting like this as they walked slowly towards the street.</p><br/><p>Jin Yi watched in confusion from the shadows. What exactly was Tang Doudou going to do?</p><br/><p>The other spies only watched the two for a little while before shifting their attentions away.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that these two were courtesans and they looked way too different from Li Xueyi. However, it must be acknowledged that it wasn\u2019t easy to do that makeup. They looked like two female ghosts.</p><br/><p>No, two male ghosts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

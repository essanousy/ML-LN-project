Only then did I break the rules and bring you into Cloud City to raise you. Although I hated you quite a lot at the start \u2013 all you did all day besides sleeping was cry, and your crying was so annoying \u2013 you were just such a tiny thing. Even if I wanted to hit you, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she gazed at the sky, Su Yi slowly started talking about the past. \u201cLater ah, when you got a bit bigger, you didn\u2019t like to cry anymore. However, you always relied on the fact that you were my disciple to cause trouble everywhere in Cloud City. No matter how many times I beat you up, you wouldn\u2019t behave. Whenever I told you to practice martial arts, you would pull pranks on me. You were completely like a boy. For some time you made me wonder if disguising you as a boy was actually turning you into a boy\u2026 Later, after that, your martial arts skills got to the point they stood out amongst your peers. You were outstanding among the young generation of Cloud City. That time, I was very happy; I think I felt even happier than when I became acknowledged as number one in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t feel anything from hearing this. However, as Su Yi vividly described the past, her nose started to sting and her heart tightened uncomfortably. Although she wasn\u2019t Li Xueyi, she could still feel from this body how much trouble Su Yi had taken to raise Li Xueyi.</p><br/><p>Normally a man would be driven crazy if you just asked him to look after a child for half the day, so there was no need to mention what it was like for Su Yi, a man with such an irascible temper. And for him, it hadn\u2019t just been a short period of time, it had been almost twenty years.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gradually came to believe in Su Yi\u2019s good intentions and came to believe that Su Yi wasn\u2019t plotting against her because, in Su Yi\u2019s heart, she was truly his child.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that, when you got a bit older, you often didn\u2019t stay in Cloud City anymore and ran around all over the world. You were very bright, much more intelligent than others, yet you disdained learning about the ways of the world and didn\u2019t bother to get on well with others, and always provoked people. You made it so that for periods at a time, my study would be filled with letters that requested for me to punish you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose idiots. Did they think I would punish you just because of that? Hehe, at most I would just act sincere and agree, then burn all those letters. To punish my own disciple just for those weak and useless strangers? As if I was that dumb!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi was protective of his child, but wasn\u2019t this way too protective?</p><br/><p>No wonder her reputation stunk so much in the Jianghu. So it was all due to how much this guy spoiled Li Xueyi!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so much trouble to raise a child. Why didn\u2019t you look for someone to help you?\u201d She was very curious. Su Yi was the City Lord so he had a lot of responsibilities, how did he have the time to raise a child?</p><br/><p>Su Yi sneered. \u201cCould someone else\u2019s way of raising compare to one\u2019s own? If the child ended up being raised wrong, in the end, I\u2019ll be the one troubled.\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, it wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t tried to find someone before. It was just that the most one held up was three days. Every single one was angered off within three days. After that, he was too lazy to keep looking.</p><br/><p>The stinkin\u2019 brat has always caused no end of trouble since she was little. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she was that person\u2019s daughter, he would have already thrown her out onto the street.</p><br/><p>Now that he thought about it, he really should have thrown her out. If he had, there probably wouldn\u2019t be so many troublesome matters now.</p><br/><p>However ah, these past years, he had used quite a lot of effort and resources to investigate this matter, yet hardly anything had turned up. But due to her, a lot of concealed secrets ended up surfacing.</p><br/><p>So it did help to save him some work.</p><br/><p>When Su Yi\u2019s thoughts got to this point, he continued, \u201cI looked through the ancient texts again after we got back to Cloud City. Your situation seems to be a trait of the Saint Tribes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA trait of the Saint Tribes? What trait?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe book I looked at didn\u2019t explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else did the book say?\u201d Tang Doudou cared quite a lot since it was related to her little life.</p><br/><p>Su Yi pulled that ancient text out from his chest and threw it to her. \u201cHere, take it and figure it out yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Da fudge? She didn\u2019t even know how to read the writing here, how could she possibly understand this?</p><br/><p>Although that was what she was thinking, she still flipped through the ancient text. The words inside gave her a huge shock. She looked at Su Yi dubiously. \u201cThese words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I almost forgot, you don\u2019t know how to read anymore.\u201d Su Yi seemed to have just recalled that fact and he made to take the ancient text back. \u201cHow about this, I\u2019ll read it aloud once for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no need. Who says I can\u2019t read it? I can read these words!\u201d Why wouldn\u2019t she be able to read this? Weren\u2019t these the Chinese characters that she had used for half her life?</p><br/><p>She never expected that the so-called language of the Saint Tribe was actually Chinese characters\u2026</p><br/><p>Although a lot of it hadn\u2019t been simplified, she could still recognize most of them. (There are traditional and simplified characters in Chinese. Some simplified and traditional characters are written the same and some aren\u2019t. Traditional is generally more complicated.)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You can read them?\u201d Her words aroused Su Yi\u2019s curiosity but he didn\u2019t ask further. Seeing that she was getting engrossed in reading, he stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell people to move your stuff to the City Lord Residence. For the next few days, you\u2019ll be learning about female etiquette.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tang Doudou was completely engrossed in reading and didn\u2019t really take in what he said. She simply replied reflexively. Right now, she was reading about the Xuanyuan Tribe\u2019s characteristics but when she skimmed over the section, she didn\u2019t see anything about eyes.</p><br/><p>Su Yi saw that she had agreed straightforwardly and nodded. \u201cThen you keep reading. I\u2019m going to sort out those annoying guys that are causing trouble in the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Su Yi left, Tang Doudou became completely focused on the book. Time gradually passed as she flipped through the thick ancient text page by page until she got to the end. As Su Yi said, the book only mentioned briefly that ice-blue pupils were a trait of the Saint Tribes\u2019 descendants, but it didn\u2019t detail which tribe it was a trait of.</p><br/><p>It made her completely confused. Didn\u2019t Shen Moru say that she was the Saint Tribes\u2019 captive? How did she suddenly became a descendant of the Saint Tribes?</p><br/><p>It seemed that the only way to clear this up was to find someone of the Saint Tribes!</p><br/><p>She closed the ancient text and looked up at the sky. It was gray and misty, it seemed very oppressing. In the distance, the wind seemed to be slowly swirling clouds towards this direction.</p><br/><p>She had already spent an entire day reading this text!</p><br/><p>Seeing that it was about to rain, she put away the text and was about to head to Cang Baicao\u2019s place when she suddenly recalled that Su Yi had said something about having her live in the City Lord Residence to learn something\u2026</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t remember what exactly it was that he said she had to learn.</p><br/><p>Forget it, there was no way he\u2019d have her learn something bad, right?</p><br/><p>Her stomach growled. Tang Doudou decided to first look for some food\u2026</p><br/><p>However, she had just taken a few steps when someone rammed into her.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-sorry. I-I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d The person that rammed into her hastily apologized. Her voice sounded very alarmed.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked over and saw that it was a young lady who seemed about sixteen. Her hair was tied up in two long ponytails and the light yellow garment she wore complimented her delicate little face, making her look very sweet and tender.</p><br/><p>Whose family\u2019s lady was this? Why was she in the City Lord Residence?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at the young girl in front of her. Just as she was about to question the girl, the sound of rapid footsteps came from outside the residence. When that young girl heard the sounds, her facial color underwent a huge change. She rushed up and grabbed Tang Doudou\u2019s hand as she begged, \u201cBig Sister, please save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

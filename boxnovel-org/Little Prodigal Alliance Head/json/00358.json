In the center of that room was an enormous glowing black rock that was full of tiny potholes. She almost instantly identified it. Wasn\u2019t that a meteorite?</p><br/><p>Why would there be a meteorite below a sinkhole? And it was even in a karst cave. This was extremely unusual. Based on how large this meteorite was, it wasn\u2019t possible for it to have been carried here by people. It had probably fallen in here somehow.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d Ninth Uncle instructed for her to stop walking, then questioned her coldly.</p><br/><p>Originally, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t want to answer, but on a whim she answered, \u201cIt\u2019s a meteorite ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA meteorite?\u201d Ninth Uncle seemed to be puzzled by this term. \u201cWhat meteorite?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was speechless. Could it be that he seriously didn\u2019t know what this and was serious in asking her? How unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to know? Humph, I won\u2019t tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Ninth Uncle didn\u2019t get angry this time and just walked forward to stroke the meteorite with an infatuated expression. \u201cI had discovered this by chance. I call it Saint Stone, you know why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t want to answer him. Since he didn\u2019t seem to be planning to leave, she found a place to sit down in order to rest.</p><br/><p>Ninth Uncle\u2019s temperament seemed to completely change. When Tang Doudou didn\u2019t pay attention to him, he didn\u2019t seem annoyed and just continued on his own, \u201cBecause I discovered that it had a very mysterious ability, it\u2019s a discovery that will change the era! I\u2019ve been studying it these past years in order to use it to create the thing I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. What mysterious ability could a meteorite have? It just contained a lot of metal, how could it possibly change the era? She really couldn\u2019t understand the world of a psycho!</p><br/><p>Ninth Uncle was still there mumbling something, but Tang Doudou\u2019s head felt very heavy and she couldn\u2019t hear him clearly. She moved her hands behind her in preparation to shift towards a more comfortable sleeping position, but she suddenly felt something smooth and cold. It felt like a dead person\u2019s hand! Her drowsiness was immediately shocked away.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s fearfully shifted her gaze towards her hand. It was truly that it\u2019d be fine if you didn\u2019t look, but that you\u2019d be scared to death the moment you looked.</p><br/><p>She immediately jumped backward like a frightened rabbit.</p><br/><p>She stared in alarm at the place she was sitting. It turned out that it wasn\u2019t flat ground but a pile of rotting corpses.</p><br/><p>She could faintly see that the conditions of the corpses weren\u2019t the same. Some had rotted so much that there was pretty much only bone left while others were just in livor mortis\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou only had a quick look, but her stomach churned and she started vomiting.</p><br/><p>Frick! No wonder she felt like there was a strange smell, so it was due to these corpses!</p><br/><p>Could it be that she was going to end up like this too?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dare to think any further along these lines. She threw up everything in her stomach. Once there was finally nothing left to throw up, she lifted her head and leaned against the meteorite behind her and gasped to catch her breath. There was no way she\u2019d let herself die in this sort of place and rot!</p><br/><p>The meteorite was not that large. Ninth Uncle walked around it several times before finally stopping in front of Tang Doudou again. \u201cYou\u2019re probably honored to become my experimental subject. You should thank me. This will wash away your crimes and you\u2019ll become a stepping stone on my tribe\u2019s path to glory!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei! Who would feel honored to become a stepping stone! You can have this honor, she had no interest in it, replied Tang Doudou silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was originally going to just kill you in order to prevent any unexpected occurrences, but I\u2019ve changed my mind. Killing you outright is such a bore, it\u2019d be much better to torment you until you wished to die. If I didn\u2019t do that, I\u2019d be wasting the wonderful chance that the Heavens gave me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavens will punish you sooner or later for your sins!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Even so, you won\u2019t live to see that day!\u201d Ninth Uncle laughed coldly, then walked up to drag Tang Doudou again.</p><br/><p>Although Tang Doudou had recovered some strength, it was still far from enough to escape, so she couldn\u2019t do anything as Ninth Uncle dragged her towards the top of the meteorite.</p><br/><p>The meteorite was round, but due to its size, the top still seemed like flat ground. There was a large hole in the meteorite that was pitch black and gave off a cold air.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem very similar to the small holes at the side. It seemed to have been chiseled out by someone, there were dig marks near the side.</p><br/><p>However, meteorites had high metallic content. There was no way it could be dug into that easily. This Ninth Uncle sure was strong, to have been able to dug out such a large hole. However, the main question was, what did he make such a large hole for?</p><br/><p>It seemed that she would find out soon!</p><br/><p>Ninth Uncle laughed strangely. \u201cYou must be wondering what this hole is for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope!\u201d Even if she was, there was no way she\u2019d tell him! Tang Doudou rolled her eyes, but before she even finished the motion, she felt the tug of gravity. She looked down in surprise and her soul got scared flying.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

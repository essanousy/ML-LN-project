All that could be seen of them were the eyes. Some of them didn\u2019t even show their eyes and were like wraiths as they moved through the crowd.</p><br/><p>The more they walked, the more worn down the surroundings seemed to become. There were also gradually fewer people. She noticed that there were only people traveling forward. There was no one that seemed to be heading the other way.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye, why are there only people entering and no one exiting?\u201d Tang Doudou tugged on Mu Ye\u2019s robe and asked quietly.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye replied, \u201cThose people are heading there to participate in the conference. They\u2019re not allowed to leave before the conference ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately froze and looked around worriedly. \u201cThen can we still turn back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fudge! She was now regretting not asking about things before she started heading here.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye nodded. \u201cWe can go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Tang Doudou pulled him and made to turn back. Who knew what the situation inside was like? What if they were caught as imposters? With so many black-robed people inside, would it even be possible to escape?</p><br/><p>Mu Ye stopped her. \u201cWe\u2019re already here, so let\u2019s just go in to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, so it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bro, it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t trust your abilities, but this was the nest of the Seven Great Saint Tribes ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people here so they won\u2019t notice us,\u201d said Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was worried that she didn\u2019t believe him because he randomly pulled over a black-robed person.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s heart leapt. What was he doing?</p><br/><p>\u201cSyndicate Leader Tan.\u201d Mu Ye exposed that person\u2019s identity and that person immediately looked towards the two of them with a flustered expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-how did you\u2026 you\u2019ve got the wrong person. I\u2019m not some syndicate leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Mu Ye\u2019s voice turned slightly cold. That person seemed to have also recognized him as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye actually nodded and admitted it. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2026 You\u2026 how did you knew who I was?\u201d Syndicate Leader Tan\u2019s voice was trembling slightly. He glanced around fearfully, then rubbed the black robe covering his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Mu Ye released him without answering.</p><br/><p>Since the person speaking was the merciless Leader of the Demonic Sect that could kill without blinking an eye, Syndicate Leader Tan immediately ran off when he was released without bothering to stay around to find out how his identity was exposed.</p><br/><p>But Tang Doudou was extremely curious ah!</p><br/><p>If she didn\u2019t remember wrong, Syndicate Leader Tan was one of the more popular figures in the martial arts alliance. She had seen this syndicate leader several times before when they were fighting against the Demonic Sect.</p><br/><p>However, how did Mu Ye know who he was with the black robe covering all his features?</p><br/><p>And how did he managed to grab someone they knew so coincidentally?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him several times, so I knew that he wasn\u2019t someone of the Saint Tribes,\u201d explained Mu Ye. \u201cThe goal of the conference is to attract people that know about the Saint Tribes back to join the Saint Tribes. Thus, probably over half the people walking on the streets don\u2019t belong to the Saint Tribes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only difference between them and us is that they were specially brought here by certain people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou understood the general idea now. It was no wonder even someone like Syndicate Leader Tan showed up at Cerulean Mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it now. Gathering people is a must if the Seven Great Saint Tribes want to re-establish themselves, that\u2019s why they sent out Saint Envoys to gather people that are willing to join the Saint Tribes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is, could it be that all of these people are descendants of the Saint Tribes? How are they able to tell?\u201d Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that they\u2019re just asking around about it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye prompted, \u201cLamp. The antique lamps.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately realized. \u201cThat antique lamp! The Pavilion Master Xin Yue once said that the lamp had the ability to recognize special blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was like that!</p><br/><p>It was starting to make more and more sense. It was likely that all of these incidents had long been arranged by the Seven Great Saint Tribes.</p><br/><p>The people of the God Firmament Hall which Feng Yunhuan was a part of were subordinates of Jun Xin, but Jun Xin never said whether Feng Yunhuan had joined before or after he became the Hall Master.</p><br/><p>In any case, when Feng Yunhuan went last time to find Xin Yue, it had definitely been for the sake of getting the blood samples that Xin Yue had on hand.</p><br/><p>Xin Yue was probably also a Saint Envoy. Her condition back then had been very strange. Now that she thought about it, Xin Yue\u2019s appearance wasn\u2019t that different from Shen Moru\u2019s. She just didn\u2019t know why Xin Yue would be chained up in the underground palace.</p><br/><p>However, by this time, investigating probably wouldn\u2019t turn up anything anymore.</p><br/><p>However, that Black Demonic Nightcrawler\u2026 When Tang Doudou\u2019s thoughts got to this point, she glanced at Mu Ye. Feng Yunhuan had said that was a creature of the Demonic Sect. However, from the looks of it now, it seemed to have been something that came from the Seven Great Saint Tribes.</p><br/><p>Then, was Mu Ye also someone of the Seven Great Saint Tribes?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Just as she was sinking into her thoughts again, Mu Ye suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked up and was stunned by the scene in front of her.</p><br/><p>She was overcome with the feeling that she had returned to Tree Valley. However, Tree Valley couldn\u2019t compare at all with this scene in front of her.</p><br/><p>The tree in front of her\u2026 calling it a mountain was a better description, but it really was a tree. Although only half of it was left, if you looked into the distance, you could still see the rings of the tree trunk. Those enormous rings on the ancient-looking wood made the people walking on it seem like tiny black ants in comparison. </p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t next to the Saint City, but suspended in midair, held up by countless enormous iron chains. Below the iron chains was thick black-colored smoke and from time to time, the cries of fearsome-sounding beasts could be heard.</p><br/><p>Enormous crisscrossing roots extended from the trunk of the tree and disappeared into the black smoke. They had already exited Saint City. Behind them were countless ruins and wild weeds. A lot of black-robed people were also standing here, frozen in awe as they stared at the enormous ancient tree floating in midair.</p><br/><p>This was probably an unforgettable scene for most people.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that more and more people were joining the Saint Tribes. They all probably thought that the Saint Tribes were gods!</p><br/><p>And this was just the leftover remnants of the Saint Tribes. Back then, the Saint Tribes were probably even more dazzling to behold.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys all standing here for? To block the path of our Saint Envoys, are you guys seeking death!?\u201d Just as Tang Doudou was spacing out due to the scene in front of her, she heard annoyed shouts come from behind her.</p><br/><p>The tone was very unbridled and for a moment, Tang Doudou had the misperception that it was Nangong Yan.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

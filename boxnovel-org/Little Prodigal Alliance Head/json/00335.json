Give birth to a whole bunch of fat boys? Wasn\u2019t that demanding her life?</p><br/><p>In addition, what if they all turned out to be girls?</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that you don\u2019t like daughters?\u201d The ancient feudal way of thinking strongly valued males over females. Baili Yu might also share the same view. If that was the case, she would rather not give birth!</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was still fantasizing about the scene she had painted earlier. He felt that it was not bad. However, there was no need to open a restaurant when it was just the two of them. Managing a restaurant was very hard work, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to help much either. There was no way he could just sit around while his wife worked.</p><br/><p>Opening a little school would be better. He could teach the little kids in the village how to read. After class, he\u2019d head home and on the way, he\u2019d be able to see the warm yellow light coming from their house. Once he got home, he\u2019d be welcomed with a table of her carefully prepared food and she\u2019d come up, delicate and cute as ever, to take the books from his hands. They\u2019d then eat together, enjoy the view of the moon together, go to sleep together\u2026</p><br/><p>En, not bad, not bad\u2026 He\u2019ll work outside to feed the family and she can stay at home to assist him in educating the children.</p><br/><p>The more Baili Yu thought about it, the more pleasing he found this idea. He was so engrossed in this fantasy that he didn\u2019t even hear what Tang Doudou said,</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou looked up and saw that foolish grin on his face, she reached towards his waist, pinched it, and twisted hard. Baili Yu immediately snapped out of it due to the pain. As he inhaled sharply, he asked, \u201cWife, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you something! Do you dislike daughters!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was confused. What did this have to do with disliking daughters?</p><br/><p>As long as she gave birth to them, what did he care whether it was a girl or a boy? He\u2019d love them to the core all the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, as long as you\u2019re the one that gives birth to them, regardless of whether it\u2019s a boy or a girl, this husband will treat them like treasure and definitely wouldn\u2019t treat them even the slightest bit unfairly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyone could say pretty words!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou then said, \u201cExcessive indulgence isn\u2019t good. As the father, you must be strict!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, if our children does something wrong, I\u2019ll definitely beat them ferociously, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just great! This child hasn\u2019t even been born, yet you\u2019re already ready to beat him? I\u2019m not giving birth anymore! If you want to beat someone, go beat someone else\u2019s child! You\u2019re not allowed to beat my son!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Baili Yu looked speechlessly towards the sky. Pregnant women truly had a lot of mood swings.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was interpreting his words too literally!</p><br/><p>Baili Yu decided not to carry on this topic anymore, otherwise he\u2019d definitely end up wrong no matter what he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, look, isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean beautiful? I\u2019m talking to you about a serious matter!\u201d huffed Tang Doudou angrily. However, though she said that, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from glancing up and was instantly captivated by the beautiful sky that was studded with sparkling gem-like stars. \u201cHow beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced down at her fluttering lashes, then lowered her onto the plank outside the carriage so that they were sitting side by side. Once Tang Doudou leaned her head on his shoulder, he wrapped his arm around her back to shield her from the slightly moist night breeze. \u201cDuring the afternoon, I saw that the weather was very sunny and cloudless, so there would probably be a very beautiful sky tonight. Since you\u2019ve been rushing around so much lately for my sake, you probably haven\u2019t taken the time to enjoy this beautiful night view, so I purposefully slowed down in order to avoid getting too close to the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I had expected, tonight really gave a beautiful view. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen such a great view as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou finally understood his considerate thoughts. She stared in a daze at the bright twinkling stars that seemed to be winking at her, then sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful night sky in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was completely true. In the modern era, it was hard to even see stars in the sky.</p><br/><p>The lively city was filled with bright neon lights at night, so the stars couldn\u2019t be seen at all.</p><br/><p>When Baili Yu heard the faint melancholy in her voice, he hugged her tighter so that her head fell against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Wife. From now on, this husband will watch the stars with you every night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d said Tang Doudou with a pout.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely keep my word. Wife should believe in this husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can Wife give me a reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at him, then spouted a string of reasons. \u201cThen you\u2019ll bring me to see them even when it\u2019s raining? What about when it\u2019s snowing? When it\u2019s cloudy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s smile froze. How was he supposed to respond to this?</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou saw that she had made him speechless, she delighted in the fact that she won over him.</p><br/><p>However, on the surface, she gave another unhappy humph. \u201cI just knew that you wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. If you can\u2019t do it, you shouldn\u2019t promise it, otherwise I\u2019d take it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Baili Yu furrowed his brows. This was the first thing he had promised her, how could he accept failure due to the weather?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if it rains, snows, or is cloudy? Isn\u2019t it just stars? If we can\u2019t see it in this part of the sky, this husband will just bring you to another part!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clearly an unreasonable declaration, but Tang Doudou was provoked to laughter. \u201cPei! You\u2019re the only one that would be bored enough to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this precisely what Wife likes about me?\u201d When she smiled, Baili Yu smiled as well. Perhaps Tang Doudou thought he was joking to make her laugh, but in his heart, this was an actual promise. He promised to take her to see the stars every day after this!</p><br/><p>Because he had lost his memories, he could no longer remember the things he had promised Tang Doudou in the past, so he naturally treated this as his first promise. Thus, he remembered it extremely strongly. Even after he later recovered his memories, he still kept this promise perfectly. However, at that time, Tang Doudou ended up terribly troubled. Who the frick was bored enough to go stargazing every single night!?</p><br/><p>Of course, this all occurred later, so it\u2019ll be set aside for now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

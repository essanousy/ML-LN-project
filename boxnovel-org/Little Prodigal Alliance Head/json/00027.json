After closing the door, she could not even see her five fingers stretched out in front of her, so she could only go to the side and open the windows. With cool moonlight pouring in, she was finally able to clearly see the furnishings in the room.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It was particularly simple. Other than the bare necessities, there was nothing else.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but associate this room with the interior of Baili Yu\u2019s palanquin, which was also this way, concise and neat. It didn\u2019t match very well with that person\u2019s character.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The surroundings were exceptionally quiet. For a while, Tang Doudou stared at the window in a daze, before she moved to the bed and sat down. Seeming to have suddenly thought of something, her pupils lit up and her lips hooked into a nefarious smile. From her sleeve she took out two sapphire gems the size of a pigeon egg, the corners of her mouth drew back to the point they almost touched her ears.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Such good things ah! Putting the gems in line with the moonlight to look, the faint blue lit up. Tang Doudou nodded her head in satisfaction and put them carefully inside the pocket of her lapel. Then her gaze landed on her broad palm.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What in the world is this made of? Not even mentioning how realistic it looks, after wearing it for so long she didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit uncomfortable at all.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Rolling up her sleeves, Tang Doudou discovered this thing\u2019s ingenuity.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then, rubbing her chest, she quickly took off the robe on her body and exposed her inner garments. In the cold of winter she could only run into the blankets before taking off her inner garments.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After all the clothes were stripped off, borrowing the moonlight, Tang Doudou looked over her body. She could only see two pink little beanbeans on the flat savanna of her chest. From far away it looked quite real, but with a closer examination some clues could be seen. In the end the technology of ancient times still isn\u2019t enough, the veined patterns are not distinct and detailed enough, the hand feel isn\u2019t realistic enough\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Cough, got off track.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tossing away the other things, Tang Doudou was still pretty curious as to how all these things worked.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way Li Xueyi could wear this plaything her entire lifetime, right?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>There\u2019s definitely a way to take it off.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Thinking up to this point, Tang Doudou started feeling her body up and down, but couldn\u2019t find the slightest trace of anything out of place.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>That\u2019s weird!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>How come she can\u2019t find it?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Suddenly her eyes swept across a mark on her shoulder. What is this?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looking closely it actually looked like a tattoo picture, like a fiery fox.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Stretching out her hand to touch it, the surface was uneven. Unable to help it, she used her hand to lightly pick at it. Her face lit up with pleasant surprise, so it was here ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Gently exploring back and forth, she lifted a piece of something that was thin as a cicada\u2019s wing. Carefully and cautiously, she slowly peeled it back, finally revealing the snow-hidden treasure.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This membrane-like thing covered her entire body. Tang Doudou squandered half the day before she was finally able to take it off. After taking it off, her entire body felt refreshed and natural. No matter how unrestrictive this thing was, it still couldn\u2019t compare to the comfort of her own skin and body. After putting on her clothes and rolling around for awhile, she finally tidied up that thing. Looking at it, she felt a bit depressed. In the future, she must always wear this when she goes out.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Her little dumplings and her little jade hands all have to be hidden away well. Otherwise, if someone found out that she\u2019s a women, the consequences would be too horrible to contemplate.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>That City Lord in the rumors, was it possible that he knew Li Xueyi\u2019s true identity? Did he know that Li Xueyi was a girl? What kind of relationship did they have?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In the end, was Baili Yu acting because someone asked him to, or just helping her for some unknown reason?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>That masked man in black, is he the Demonic Sect Leader Mu Ye? Last time he didn\u2019t succeed, but if they met again, would she still be able to escape with such luck?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Would Elder Yu let her off just like that?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Everything of everything, she didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t even know what she should do tomorrow. If Baili Yu really refused to cure the poison for her, wouldn\u2019t she just have to wait for death?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Ah! Head hurts to death. Why the feather couldn\u2019t they just let her be a proper otaku girl, why\u2019d she have to transmigrate here to this different world to be some Alliance Head!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Apart from cooking she doesn\u2019t know how to do a single thing.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tossing and turning on the bed, the more Tang Doudou wanted to sleep, the more she was unable to fall asleep. Her brain was incomparably clear. Why not just make something tasty for Baili Yu to eat tomorrow to perhaps gain his favor? Once he feels happy he might cure her poison while at it!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Such unpalatable snacks could even become specialties of Rutaceae Pavilion. She, Tang Doudou, has studied cookbooks for years at her house and was also a genuine foodie, no matter what she makes it should still be tastier than that specialty!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It\u2019s best to make something Baili Yu has never seen before. With the kind of money he has, only strange and exotic things will be able to attract his attention!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou thought about it, she got more and more excited. She wished she could just climb up right now to go prepare.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But thinking about it,if she didn\u2019t rest properly and accidentally messed up, wouldn\u2019t it be that the gains will not make up for the losses?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Forget it, first rest properly. Plan again tomorrow!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Ha, and so she cheerfully decided just like that The things in Tang Doudou\u2019s heart came fast and also left fast. Thinking that there were things to do tomorrow, she turned over a couple times on the bed and then sleepiness started attacking. Her eyelids fought up and down. Not long later, the sound of even breathing in the darkness could be heard.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After being busy half the night, the exhausted Tang Doudou finally fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The window was half open and the cool moon was still as before. No one expected that this night would be so endless, that so many things would occur.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then, the morning sun rose the next day and dispersed the cool fog. A single sentence in the Jianghu caused the pot to explode.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In regards to yesterday\u2019s martial arts convention, the opinions differed. The focus of the topics, other than Li Xueyi, was still Li Xueyi.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This year-round gods appear and devils vanish* existence finally showed his true identity last night. Reportedly, he\u2019s an elegant young man, extraordinarily elegant.</p><br/><p>If you think about it, it should be pretty straightforward. Li Xueyi is hardly ever seen, whether someone tries to look for him they can never catch him, just like the ways devils flee when gods appear.</p><br/><p>But he was still as strange and arrogant as in the rumors.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The topic most worthy of mention was that Baili Yu appeared and even took Li Xueyi away with him. This subject could even be said to have trumped all other debate topics. Even the common people have all heard of it and discuss it enthusiastically over cups of tea and after meals.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In regards to this, Tang Doudou who was currently snoring sound asleep on the bed was completely unaware. The warm sunshine spilled into the room from outside the window, falling onto the head of the bed. The morning wind brushed past, exposing the Tang Doudou had slept all over the place on the bed and her unfurled graceful brows now contained a trace of a smile. Seeming to have dreamed of some particularly happy event, the corners of her mouth slightly perked up.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Smack smack, so tasty!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Ice cream, frozen treats, sweet bean paste\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Spicy strips\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Haaa\u2026.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cSo spicy\u2026 so refreshing\u2026\u201d Mumbling that as she struggled to move her lips, a pleasure-filled moan spilled out.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The light sound was particularly loud in the spacious quiet room.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The person on the bed suddenly opened her eyes, but being hit with the bright sunlight, closed them again. Then, she slowly opened her eyes again, stupefyingly looking outside the window, her spirit coming back.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Meow ah, the spicy strips and snacks were actually dreams ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She had already transmigrated, those things are already out of her reach\u2026 not happy.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Waking up the next day in this space-time, Tang Doudou reminisced about the spicy strips as she mournfully got out of bed. Looking outside at the bright sunlight, she cozily stretched her arms.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In the fresh and clean atmosphere, the faint fragrance of flowers diffused through the air and mixed with the sun\u2019s flavor. In a flash, the depressed Tang Doudou was full of energy again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>They all say that transmigrating to ancient times has three benefits; beautiful men, air, aphrodisiac!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The first two she had experienced before but this aphrodisiac\u2026 Hehehe\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin with evil designs. She didn\u2019t want to experience it, but if there\u2019s a chance for her to increase her knowledge (by peeping), she wouldn\u2019t mind.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Baili Yu, if he ended up having an aphrodisiac, what would he be like?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Imagining it, she was really starting to look forward to it a little!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The day after the martial arts convention, the Martial Arts Circles Alliance Head, Tang Doudou, got up in the midst of unrestrained YY*.</p><br/><p>Unrealistic fantasies/imagination running wild</p><br/><p>Naturally she was still wearing that layer of disguise membrane. After moving about a little, she straightened up her hair and casually tied it before heading out of the room.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Last night it was too dark so she couldn\u2019t see anything, but right now, the sun was just right. Only after she got to the courtyard did Tang Doudou start to feel that Baili Yu was someone that had rather good taste. Every object and scene in the courtyard was amazingly elegant, there was almost a trace of Suzhou Park\u2019s existence.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin has also said it before, Baili Yu likes quietness, that\u2019s why there are also not many people here.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked around in a huge circle and couldn\u2019t even see the trace of a ghost. She couldn\u2019t help but suspect that the \u2018not many people\u2019 Qing Yin talked about meant that there were simply no people?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>And she also couldn\u2019t find where Qing Yin and the others were, so out of boredom, Tang Doudou started doing Tai Chi under the tree, doing a few repetitions of some broadcasted exercises.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOne two three four, two two three four, three two three four\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuhaa, huuhuuhaahaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After she got hot from jumping, she took off her outer robe and hung it on the branch of a tree, then continued jumping.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>When Qing Yin came over, she was just in time to see Tang Doudou jumping into stretching exercises. Her arms evenly moved, the rhythm natural as all of the movements flowed smoothly together. Adding in her chanting rhythm, it had quite an unique charm.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What school what sect\u2019s martial arts is this? So strange?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou still had no idea that someone had come and was still minding her own business and focusing on her movements. Grandpa had said so before, those fat burning exercises and beauty gymnastics don\u2019t hold a candle to the effectiveness of this broadcasted exercise. It can both temper the body and adjust the body\u2019s balance, making it so a person would feel more active and sun-drenched.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Ever since she was little she would do this broadcasted exercise with Grandpa together, all the way until Grandpa passed away. These years, she had also persisted with it. Even though it wasn\u2019t as amazing as Grandpa had described it, it was still not bad!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Recalling Grandpa, Tang Doudou started practicing with even more enthusiasm. Her palms and soles of her feet were almost about to generate gusts of wind.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin stood not far away. Originally, she wanted to call her, but she was also worried about disturbing her as she practiced. So she could only watch as she practiced her eccentric martial arts and daze out.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The garden was refined and peaceful, from time to time there would be the tinkling sounds of birdsong.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After exercising for a bit more, Tang Doudou became really tired and plopped her butt down on the rock bench beneath the tree. Rubbing her stomach she noisily shouted: \u201cWhy is Qing Yin still not here, I\u2019m about to starve to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing her blameful look as she pouted, it was even more cutely sweet and charming than some girls. Qing Yin couldn\u2019t help but lightly sigh, if this was really a woman it\u2019d be perfect.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi.\u201d Seeing that Tang Doudou\u2019s plaintive complaints towards her was about to expand and float to far reaches, Qing Yin cast a glance at the food in her hands and softly called.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hearing Qing Yin\u2019s clear spring voice, Tang Doudou immediately bounced up and turned around to see Qing Yin who was approaching, walking on lotus flowers while wearing a water blue cheongsam.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Li gongzi hungry?\u201d Qing Yin approached and took the foodand arranged it on the stone table: \u201cThese are all famous breakfast items of Huai City. Li gongzi try tasting it and see if it palatable. If it isn\u2019t, Qing Yin will call for someone to bring something different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looking at the plates of delicate breakfast items on the stone table, Tang Doudou, who was already hungry to the point her chest was sticking to her back, didn\u2019t have the mind to care whether it was palatable or not. She reached out and picked up a piece of osmanthus flower cake and put it into her mouth.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Pei pei pei!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The instant after she placed it into her mouth Tang Doudou immediately spat it out. Her facial color was queer as she looked at the remaining half of the cake in her hand. How does this even count as an osmanthus flower cake!? It doesn\u2019t even has the taste of osmanthus flowers! It\u2019s filled with a strange odor that\u2019s sweet to the point of emitting greasiness! The taste was also not meticulous enough. It\u2019s too lacking, way too lacking!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin, are you sure these are all Huai City\u2019s most famous delicacies?\u201d Tang Doudou put down the cake in her hand. Even though she was really hungry, but as the bone ash level* foodie of the foodie world, she simply could not choke this strange tasting osmanthus flower cake down.</p><br/><p>\u201dBone ash level\u201d is a term often used in online game chats. A self-pronounced \u2018bone ash level\u2019 player feels that he has a very high level of achievement, and is very experienced.</p><br/><p>This reaction of Tang Doudou\u2019s caused Qing Yin to be a bit annoyed. Even if the thing doesn\u2019t fit his taste he shouldn\u2019t spit it out in front of her face. Whatever the case, for this breakfast she has put in some thought and effort because she wanted to satisfy Li Xueyi and make it so that he\u2019d have less complaints towards Master. </p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She never expected that he would actually be this ungrateful!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by MrPriest, Proofread by Ocelot</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>In my experience, when you\u2019re super awake late in the night, the ideas that hit are super dangerous because they\u2019re half genius and half you-will-definitely-regret-it.</p><br/><p>MP: I definitely agree, I\u2019ve had some of the most amazing ideas in that state.

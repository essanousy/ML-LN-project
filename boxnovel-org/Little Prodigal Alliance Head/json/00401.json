In all honesty, she was a little scared of facing Bai Feiyun. The side of him that she saw yesterday was too frightening.</p><br/><p>Her strange attitude caused Elder Yu to frown in confusion. \u201cAlliance Head, didn\u2019t you go to pursue the mysterious person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pursue the mysterious person?</p><br/><p>\u201cEn. Who told you guys?\u201d Tang Doudou saw their confused expressions and asked this lightly.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu replied, \u201cBai gongzi. It was Bai gongzi that said this. He said that Alliance Head had discovered traces of the mysterious person and had gone to chase after him. He said that you were going to capture that person so everyone should wait here in the morning for your return!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Bai Feiyun again. She had clearly been running from him, but he actually said that she had gone to capture the mysterious person.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, that\u2019s right. However, he managed to get away again.\u201d Even though it wasn\u2019t true, Tang Doudou allowed it to stand. After all, how else was she supposed to explain her disappearance? Moreover, her conflict with Bai Feiyun and Jun Xin\u2019s death weren\u2019t things that she could explain right now.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu and the others looked disappointed. They had sincerely hoped that Tang Doudou would be able to capture that person so that they didn\u2019t have to be so jumpy anymore.</p><br/><p>However, it was understandable. If it was that easy to capture that person, the four large families wouldn\u2019t have requested for help from the martial arts alliance and there wouldn\u2019t have been so many deaths on the Jianghu.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, everyone, please head back! Alliance Head must be tired from rushing about an entire night. Let\u2019s push off the cremation until tomorrow!\u201d Elder Yu took the initiative to disperse the crowd.</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou waved her hand and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019m not tired. Let\u2019s finish this matter then head back to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that, she walked into the courtyard. Baili Yiling also walked in, following after Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>When everyone saw her familiar yet unfamiliar face, they were stunned. Elder Yu and Mother Mo Yun asked almost simultaneously. \u201cThis is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I forgot to introduce her. This is Baili gongzi\u2018s younger sister, Baili Yiling. You guys have probably already heard of her. I just happened to run into her when I headed out last night. She has also come because of the mysterious person. The Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce also counts as part of the Jianghu, so I think no one would mind Lady Baili\u2019s participation in this matter, right?\u201d said Tang Doudou slowly as she slowly looked over everyone.</p><br/><p>Even though Baili Yiling didn\u2019t count as someone of the Jianghu, she was Tang Doudou\u2019s sister-in-law so it was natural for her to help out. In addition, Tang Doudou had already put things so reasonably and plainly, so who would dare to still have objections?</p><br/><p>Elder Yu, Mo Yun, and Xiao Yiyun shared a glance and instantly understood each others\u2019 stances. \u201cWe\u2019re very touched that Lady Baili is willing to help, why would we have any objections?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou laughed. \u201cEn, since that\u2019s the case, everyone, please prepare. Let\u2019s send our comrades off in an hour!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>After this shout, everyone went off to do their own things, leaving only Elder Yu\u2019s group remaining here.</p><br/><p>\u201cYiling, come greet these elders.\u201d Since they had to work together for the time being, it was best not to make their relationship too stiff. Even if Elder Yu and the others discarded their status, their age was already enough to demand respect, so there was nothing inappropriate about Yiling saluting them.</p><br/><p>With how clever Baili Yiling was, there was no way she would miss Tang Doudou\u2019s intentions. She smiled sweetly and respectfully saluted them. \u201cYiling greets you, seniors. Yiling\u2019s a newcomer and hopes that you\u2019ll help guide Yiling a little. If Yiling makes any unwitting mistakes, please forgive my ignorance!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was born with good looks and clear lively eyes that gave people the impression that she was very lively and cute without any schemes.</p><br/><p>These aged elders were especially weak to cute young girls like this. Originally, they were concerned about Baili Yiling\u2019s identity, but when they heard this respectful and slightly mischievous greeting, those concerns vanished without a trace.</p><br/><p>Mo Yun immediately walked up with a smile to take Baili Yiling\u2019s hands. \u201cWhat an adorable little lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling also smiled back sweetly. \u201cMany thanks, Mother, for your high praise. Yiling is really happy to be able to get Mother\u2019s praise!\u201d</p><br/><p>From the side, Tang Doudou took in her fake smile and her lips twitched. This girl was seriously too good at acting!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

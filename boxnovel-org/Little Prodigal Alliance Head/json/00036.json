That guy doesn\u2019t have the patience to squander time eavesdropping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head actually knows him quite well.\u201d Hearing Tang Doudou say this, Bai Feiyun lightly smiled and really did stop being on guard. He walked to the bed and placed the medicine box down, \u201cExtend your hand. After I finish treating you I still have to go back to give the Murong family a reply.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said \u2018en\u2019 in reply, then asked: \u201cWhat do you plan to do about this incident?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDealing with this incident isn\u2019t hard, what\u2019s hard is probably which method we should choose to use.\u201d Bai Feiyun used medicine to wipe around the blanched flesh and said gently, \u201cIt\u2019ll hurt a bit, hold on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>His voice was gentle as water, sweeping through her heart and making her feel soothed. His hand movements were even more incomparably gentle. He said it would hurt, but in reality his movements were well practised and swift; Tang Doudou didn\u2019t even have the chance to feel anything before she saw that he had already finished treating it.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai, who exactly is it that\u2019s directing the Murong family? Do they have a grudge against me, or is it that they\u2019re unhappy with Cloud City?\u201d She was half sitting up on the bed with her hand placed on the side of the bed. Bai Feiyun was half crouched next to the bed treating the injury while talking to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe still haven\u2019t figured out who exactly is directing it behind the scenes but there\u2019s not much connection with Elder Yu. He only called the Murong family over for the sake of wanting to cause you trouble during the martial arts convention.\u201d</p><br/><p>His side profile was exceptionally focused and there was a faint caution between his brows. His long eyelashes cast a wide shadow on his fair face and slightly trembled with his movements.</p><br/><p>Ay, when this handsome gets serious his attractiveness level is practically about to charm Beanbeans to death!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter I\u2019ll try to end as soon as possible.\u201d Bai Feiyun gave his word resolutely.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou became curious: why does he treat her this well?</p><br/><p>Or perhaps it should be put this way: why does he treat Li Xueyi this well? He\u2019s a member of White Wind Manor. From the information she gathered at the martial arts convention, he should be a very neutral type, yet after she appeared he kept helping her one time after another and never showed any suspicion towards her.</p><br/><p>If he was very familiar with Li Xueyi and they had a really good relationship, now that it\u2019s a different person could it be possible for him not to sense it?</p><br/><p>Or is it that there\u2019s some business deal that she wasn\u2019t aware of in this? That\u2019s why Bai Feiyun had no choice but to help her like this?</p><br/><p>As she pondered and watched him, the question came out, \u201cXiao Bai, why do you treat me so well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Bai Feiyun\u2019s movements froze. Lifting his eyes, he asked: \u201cWhy are you suddenly asking this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other hand tucked back a few strands of fine hair that had fallen over his face. Tang Doudou\u2019s watery pupils were a bit dazed, \u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two were silent for a little while before Bai Feiyun lowered his pupils, \u201cIt\u2019s that you don\u2019t trust me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know how she should express the opinion in her heart. Should she say she doesn\u2019t trust him? But she does trust\u2026 well at least she trusts him much more than she does Jun Xin. But to really say that she trusts him, in actuality she didn\u2019t know how she could trust him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn truth, you need not worry. Just believe that I won\u2019t harm you. That\u2019s enough.\u201d Bai Feiyun slightly smiled as he continued to help bind her wound.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost your memories. I\u2019ll help you slowly recover your memories again until you remember everything. If the memories seriously can not be recovered, I\u2019ll still help you sit stably on the Alliance Head seat and let you live the latter half of your life without worries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lost your martial arts, lost everything, so I\u2019ll be your left shoulder, your right arm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you still don\u2019t believe, I can only give one sentence as an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly lifted his head, his ink jade-like pupils filled with never seen before earnestness, \u201cBecause it was a promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because it was a promise.</p><br/><p>Five simple and direct words, yet Tang Doudou felt sorrow bubbling up from the bottom of her heart. This sentence seemed to overcome a thousand, ten thousand years, reaching her soul which belonged in the era ten million years into the future and giving this faint message.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t remember anything anymore.\u201d Tang Doudou lowered her eyes, exceptionally perplexed.</p><br/><p>Exactly what promise did Bai Feiyun and Li Xueyi have? And what kind of friendship was it exactly that would make Bai Feiyun uphold his promise so unwaveringly like this?</p><br/><p>The one he made the promise to was Li Xueyi, not her, Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>It was to the Li Xueyi that would never recover his memories.</p><br/><p>This guess of Tang Doudou\u2019s was not far off from the truth, in the past Bai Feiyun and Li Xueyi really did make an arrangement. As for the content that was agreed on, other than Bai Feiyun himself, there was no other person in the world that knew, because the real Li Xueyi has already died.</p><br/><p>And at that time, Bai Feiyun already promised to Li Xueyi that unless Li Xueyi took the initiative to bring it up, he would not say the contents of this arrangement out loud even if he were to die.</p><br/><p>So this matter, as long as there were no unexpected events, would never be revealed.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter, as long as it\u2019s you it\u2019s correct.\u201d Bai Feiyun tied the white gauze and finished binding the wound.</p><br/><p>Getting up, he took out a bunch of bottles and vials from his medicine box and arranged it in order next to the bed. Picking out one of the bottles and holding it in his palm, he gave a deep sigh before saying: \u201cI believe that Baili Yu has already told you that other than Tendons Softening Powder there\u2019s another poison in your body. When I helped you take your pulse earlier I had discovered that the poison had already flared up several times. Unfortunately, my medical expertise is limited and could not figure out why that poison still hasn\u2019t flared up again after those first couple times.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for that bunch of genuine and sincere words that he said earlier, Tang Doudou would\u2019ve thought he was hoping for that poison to flare up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis poison is called Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, Baili Yu has already told me about it.\u201d And it\u2019s definitely not that it didn\u2019t flare up but that after it flared up the real Li Xueyi had already breathed his last. It\u2019s was because of that that she, this pitiful Beanbeans, would transmigrate into Li Xueyi\u2019s body. Don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s fortunate or unfortunate.</p><br/><p>These things she naturally couldn\u2019t say to Bai Feiyun. After her injury was treated, she felt a little tired. As she listened to Bai Feiyun\u2019s voice that was genial as the spring wind, she became even drowsier.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the matters on this side is dealt with, I\u2019ll take a trip to Azure Water Valley and ask Elder Senior Cang what exactly this is. During this time, no matter what happens you must not have a falling out with Baili Yu. Compared to Elder Yu, he\u2019s much much harder to deal with. Those little smarts of yours will be useless. That person is unfathomably deep, even the City Lord doesn\u2019t have inside information about him. For him to suddenly meddle in the martial arts convention definitely is not just out of some whim. You must carefully bear this in mind. Moreover, the only person in this world that can cure Disseminating Tassel Fragrance is him so it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t become enemies with him\u2026 I\u2019ve marked all of these pills with their usage and names. They\u2019re all for common usage so you should remember to put them away well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zzzzz\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was giving an enthusiastic briefing when the sound of gentle breathing entered his ears. Lifting his eyes, he saw that at some point Tang Doudou\u2019s head had tilted to the side and she had fallen asleep. Her appearance as she slept was naive and tender, from time to time she would even smack her lips. Bai Feiyun gave a helpless smile and collected those vials and placed them next to the pillow before bending down to softly shift Tang Doudou so that she laid flat and tucked in her blanket.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a nice nap.\u201d Bai Feiyun gazed at this familiar face and suddenly recalled the first time they met.</p><br/><p>The memory was like water, in a moment it receded again. Giving a light sigh, Bai Feiyun picked up the medicine box and left.</p><br/><p>Next to the window, Jun Xin hung upside down from the ceiling and watched Bai Feiyun\u2019s leaving figure in a daze all the way until it was completely gone from sight. Then he softly dropped down and turned to approach Tang Doudou\u2019s bed. His gaze turned towards that pile of bottles and vials beside the bed.</p><br/><p>Randomly picking one bottle up, clear notes were written on it. It pretty much explained the usage of this pill, the method and the usage amount.</p><br/><p>This Bai Feiyun was actually quite meticulous.</p><br/><p>Placing the bottle back down, his hand stroked past Tang Doudou\u2019s forehead. The dead asleep guy didn\u2019t feel it at all. Jun Xin felt speechless, wasn\u2019t his vigilance a bit too low?</p><br/><p>But these weren\u2019t things that needed to be included in the range of his considerations. Right now, he only hoped that this guy could get better a little more quickly, that way he would be able to taste how much skill he had exactly in cooking.</p><br/><p>Once food was mentioned, Jun Xin recalled those spicy strips which taste continues to linger in his memory.</p><br/><p>Crap, the meal box!</p><br/><p>The sea of plum flowers stretched on like a blossoming field of snow. In Plum Pavilion, the red garment very much resembled that of a fire demon.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu laid on his side on the couch, his long and narrow peach blossom eyes were languid and charming as his slender fingers played with that jade colored tablet, his expression at ease.</p><br/><p>Opposite him was a black clothed person with black hair and cold pupils, sitting upright. His vicious pupils were engraved with a fiery blaze.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye couldn\u2019t understand at all why this host that he wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach even with eight bamboo poles(hard to strike up friendly relations with) would suddenly send him an invitation to come to this famous plum garden to drink tea.</p><br/><p>To come drink tea was just to drink tea. Ever since the start when they exchanged greetings, the two didn\u2019t even say a single word.</p><br/><p>It was seriously just drinking tea.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t have that much leisure to come accompany him to drink tea. Mu Ye stood up.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t lift his eyes. Giving a light laugh, he said: \u201cSect Master Mu, leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye was expressionless and coldly replied: \u201cFarewell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Sect Master Mu very busy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t have as much free time as Baili gongzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Sect Master Mu is busy with everything, then this one also won\u2019t keep you any longer.\u201d His finger tapped against the jade pendant causing a clear sound. Baili Yu ordered in a light tone, \u201cYe Chuan, see Sect Master Mu off.\u201d</p><br/><p>A young man dressed in rogue garments dropped down and saluted Baili Yu before saying to Mu Ye: \u201cSect Master Mu, this way please!\u201d</p><br/><p>But Mu Ye didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>There was a hint of doubt in the depths of his cold pupils, was he overthinking it? Did Baili Yu seek him out only for the sake of drinking tea? Or was it for something else? His gaze fell on that jade tablet and Mu Ye because even less certain. Could it be that Baili Yu came for the sake the matter last night?</p><br/><p>Affairs of the Alliance Head Residence, he really intends to get involved? And what would that person from Cloud City think?</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master Mu?\u201d Seeing him motionless for quite a while, Ye Chuan prompted.</p><br/><p>Only then did Mu Ye respond. His ramrod straight figure moved, but rather than walk out the pavilion he sat down once again. Picking up that cup of tea that had been untouched since the beginning, he asked: \u201cWhat kind of tea is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu saw that he sat back down once again and knew that today\u2019s goal had already been half reached. Putting the jade tablet back into his wide sleeve, he switched to another cozy position before replying: \u201cNoble Sierra*.\u201d</p><br/><p> The options were complete pinyin(Mei Shan Jian), partial pinyin (Meishan Point), very literal translation (Eyebrows Mountain Point), edited translation (Upper Mountain Peak), and finally, the very liberal derivative that sounds a little bit more like tea (Noble Sierra). Just for reference because I\u2019ll probably end up using a blend, but which one would you guys prefer in the future for things like medicines, martial arts techniques and herbs?</p><br/><p>\u201cGood tea.\u201d Even Mu Ye\u2019s praise was cold as frost without the least bit of emotion.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cGood guests suit good tea. As long as Sect Master Mu doesn\u2019t disdain it, all is well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the two start to chat, Ye Chuan didn\u2019t wait for Baili Yu\u2019s instruction and noiselessly withdrew from the pavilion.</p><br/><p>Walking into the sea of plum flowers, he encountered Meng Yu who was holding a meal box.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Yu jie, you\u2019re here to bring food to Master?\u201d Ye Chuan smiled as he walked up, about to take Meng Yu\u2019s meal box, \u201cRight now Master is discussing matters with a guest. It looks like the brothers will be able to enjoy today\u2019s food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Yu was just passing by and wanted to ask if Master wanted to eat anything. After the deer meat was sneakily eaten by Jun Xin during lunch, Master still hasn\u2019t had anything to eat yet.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t think that the moment she headed over she would encounter Ye Chuan. Looking at this young man whose face was filled with sunshine, in the sea of plum blossoms he was as beautiful as a dream. There were only the two of them here so Meng Yu was nervous to the point her pulse raced, yet at the same time she was worried that her face would flush, especially when she saw Ye Chuan\u2019s fair fingers reach over. She felt like her heart was about to leap out of her chest.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan didn\u2019t know the young lady\u2019s heart. When his hand touched the food box Meng Yu suddenly jumped away, as if she received a great shock. His face expressed confusion as he asked with concern: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you not feel well?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice made Meng Yu even more flustered until she lost track of all directions.</p><br/><p>Seeing her face flush and breathing get heavy, Ye Chuan thought that she probably caught a cold and wanted to try feeling her temperature. But as soon as he got close Meng Yu went \u2018ah\u2019 and directly shoved the food box to Ye Chuan, turned around, and ran without even a goodbye.</p><br/><p>Leaving behind Ye Chuan whose entire face was at a loss, completely not understanding what had just happened.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by LazyMiyu, Proofread by Ocelot</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>Author has a message: Are there any nice people momozizi(kissing sounds)?

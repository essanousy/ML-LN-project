She only screeched to a stop upon hearing that familiar voice. Straightening out her garments, she replied calmly, \u201cNo need to be so polite. Elder Yu has come back from a long and difficult journey, you should hurry and go rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t expect that she would so coincidentally run into Elder Yu. She hadn\u2019t even prepared anything yet, so she was a bit flustered. She had managed to force herself to make an unperturbed expression, but a trace of panic still flashed through her eyes.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu had extensive experience so naturally he noticed the panic in her eyes. He inwardly smiled coldly. He had hastily rushed back the moment he got the news, for the sake of catching her pigtail and adding the crime of planning a revolt with someone of the previous dynasty onto her crime of being violent towards the emperor. Li Xueyi, I\u2019d like to see who could protect you this time.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was in the distant Mist City with his hands full. Su Yi has also returned to his city to deal with matters. Humph. All that remained was Bai Feiyun, and he was nothing to worry about.</p><br/><p>Thinking to here, Elder Yu couldn\u2019t help but smile smugly. He couldn\u2019t suppress the smile at all. \u201cWhat does this bit of toil matter? It is a matter of course to toil for sake of the safety of all the orthodox martial arts circles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yu\u2019s willingness to bear the burden of such tasks is truly a great example for my generation and the great fortune of the martial arts circles ah!\u201d Tang Doudou clicked her tongue as she exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>This Li Xueyi\u2019s ability to handle matters was nothing much but her mouth was quite amazing. When she said good words, people that heard them would feel light and airy. This was what Elder Yu was thinking. He found her earlier words very pleasing to the ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, please don\u2019t praise. These are all things that this Yu ought to do and are not worth mentioning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s lips twitched, she was very speechless in regards to Elder Yu\u2019s shameless moral integrity. Her earlier tone clearly showed that she was speaking in opposites. Did he really not understand it or was he just pretending not to have understood it?</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter, she should first settle him down.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yu is truly too modest. You and Bai gongzi have truly been a great help during this time that Xueyi wasn\u2019t here. Some other day Xueyi must invite Elder Yu out for a drink to convey my thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be denied that Li Xueyi has become harder to read after this outing. Or was it that he had finally understood the situation and decided not to fight against him anymore?</p><br/><p>Elder Yu couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly Tang Doudou was planning and decided not to rush into rising in revolt for now, but to figure out what she was planning first.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head is too courteous. I heard that Alliance Head had just arrived as well? I wonder if Alliance Head has seen Bai gongzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Elder Yu looking for me for something?\u201d Just as the two were exchanging veiled words, Bai Feiyun\u2019s gentle voice came from inside the Alliance Head Residence. His white garments fluttered in the wind as he walked towards the entrance.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun glanced at Tang Doudou. \u201cI\u2019ve already sent out the people to provide assistance. If there are no other matters, I shall head back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was leaving?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was stunned for a moment. Fudge, if he left, wouldn\u2019t she, this little white lamb, but eaten cleanly by Elder Yu, this old wolf\u2026</p><br/><p>Pei! It should be having her \u2018bones crushed and skin flayed!\u2019</p><br/><p>That wouldn\u2019t do. No matter what she couldn\u2019t let Xiao Bai run away right now.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 She looked towards Bai Feiyun and saw him wink towards her. The electricity sent by those long eyelashes caused her heart to quiver. Swallowing back her saliva, she thought, what exactly did that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Are there no other matters?\u201d Bai Feiyun had no choice but to nudge Tang Doudou again upon seeing her blank expression.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t an idiot, she immediately came to realize that Xiao Bai was helping her get out of this situation. She had almost been paralyzed by those beautiful eyes. It really was a merit to have good looks, just a wink was already that captivating.</p><br/><p>She immediately acted like she had suddenly recalled something. \u201cAiyah, there really is a matter I need to you to help me with.\u201d</p><br/><p>She turned around and said to Elder Yu in an apologetic tone, \u201cElder Yu, I still have business so I\u2019ll leave first. If there are any matters, let\u2019s discuss them when I get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she pulled Bai Feiyun and headed out of the Alliance Head Residence.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to ask Bai Feiyun what to do next in a small voice, Elder Yu\u2019s voice made them stop. \u201cAlliance Head, please wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although tears whirled in her eyes, she still gritted her teeth and refuted angrily.</p><br/><p>However, the Steadfast Prince just laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who came over to be humiliated by me, but now you\u2019re blaming for insulting you? Say, aren\u2019t you trash?\u201d</p><br/><p>That woman\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief, then her eyes filled with disappointment. She could still accept the earlier words. After all, no one was perfect and she was already much better than many of the women in the world. It was just that the Steadfast Prince, who has always sought perfection, couldn\u2019t accept those few flaws.</p><br/><p>In addition, he had even praised her courage and gotten off his palanquin to speak to her. These two factors were enough to make her continue preservering, but unexpectedly, the Steadfast Prince actually said the word \u2018trash\u2019!</p><br/><p>And he had directed it straight towards her!</p><br/><p>No matter how strong she was, she couldn\u2019t take it and started sobbing.</p><br/><p>That sobbing contained so much hurt that Tang Doudou\u2019s heart ached for her. She couldn\u2019t help but feel confused. Could it be that the Steadfast Prince had a grudge against this girl? Otherwise, why would he be so ruthless as to stab her with every single word? If it was a girl whose skin was just a little thinner, she probably would\u2019ve already ran back home to hang herself.</p><br/><p>Uh, she wasn\u2019t trying to snidely insult that woman.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, that Steadfast Prince didn\u2019t even bother to glance at the woman and just got back into the palanquin. Afterwards, he turned around and asked the person behind him, \u201cImperial Older Brother, don\u2019t you agree with my words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Older Brother?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s heart jumped and she tried to look behind the Steadfast Prince, but it was too dark to see who it was.</p><br/><p>She wanted to ask Baili Yu who the Imperial Older Brother of the Steadfast Prince was, but then she recalled that he had lost all his memories, so there was no way he would know.</p><br/><p>Since this scene was probably over, she said, \u201cI\u2019m tired, let\u2019s go find an inn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu usually went with everything she decided, so he immediately nodded and held her hand to leave.</p><br/><p>However, before they even took a step, the so-called Imperial Older Brother spoke. \u201cAh Yin, let\u2019s return to the residence.\u201d</p><br/><p>This voice!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pulled Baili Yu and indicated with her eyes for him not to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you worried about? Imperial Older Brother, it\u2019s a rare for you to visit my Green Maple City. As the master of Green Maple City, of course I must act as host and properly welcome Imperial Older Brother, no? Although this woman doesn\u2019t suit my tastes, I feel that she suits you quite well, so why don\u2019t I just accept her for you? Once you return to your residence, I\u2019ll send her directly over?\u201d This Steadfast Prince turned out to be quite unrestrained. He seriously said whatever he wanted to.</p><br/><p>However, it made sense since this was his territory and no one could do anything to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yin, stop messing around. This lady is also someone from a good family. Even if you don\u2019t like her, you shouldn\u2019t purposefully hurt her with your words. If people actually took you seriously, how is that lady supposed to get married in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou finally heard the voice clearly. Xiqiu Yue was sitting in this Steadfast Prince\u2019s palanquin!</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Imperial Older Brother doesn\u2019t like this lady with the very big chest? But your residence is always so empty. Why don\u2019t you hurry and just take some so that when it gets lonely at night\u2026\u201d The Steadfast Prince continued to say whatever came to mind without restraint.</p><br/><p>Xiqiu Yue angrily interrupted. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to help you, I\u2019ll leave right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Steadfast Prince only stopped after this threat. He waved dispiritedly. \u201cThen forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he waved, guards immediately ran forward to drag the crying girl to the side of the street in order to clear the path.</p><br/><p>The girl was crying so hard that she seemed almost on her last breath. She was limp like a corpse as the guards dragged her to the side. The guards were also like their master and showed no tender feelings for the fairer sex as they simply threw her onto the ground and left.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, the girl was thrown right where Tang Doudou and Baili Yu were standing. The two shared a look and saw that neither of them had any intentions of getting involved, so they prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>However, just as Tang Doudou took a step forward, her skirt was grabbed. That abrupt, strong force almost caused her to fall to the ground. Fortunately, Baili Yu was right next to her and caught her.</p><br/><p>They glanced down and saw that the woman who had been crying heartbrokenly just a moment earlier was now pulling Tang Doudou\u2019s skirt.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s gaze turned cold when he saw that she was grabbing Tang Doudou\u2019s skirt tightly. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><br/><p>That woman turned towards Tang Doudou with a beseeching look. \u201cThis aunt, can you please help this humble girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Tang Doudou refused. \u201cLady, I\u2019m really sorry, but as you can see, I\u2019m already very old. Although I have the desire, I don\u2019t have the strength. Please let go and allow me to leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, I can tell from the looks of you that you\u2019re a good person, so please help me!\u201d When Tang Doudou straightforwardly rejected her, she started sobbing again.</p><br/><p>As she sobbed, she said, \u201cI\u2019m actually from very far away and I\u2019ve spent all my money to get here. The road back is so long and far\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did these words sound so familiar? It sounded like she was lifting a sign and begging to be taken as a mistress?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When she looked up, she saw that Mu Ye was staring at her again.</p><br/><p>She rubbed her chin. Why was everyone acting so strange lately?</p><br/><p>It was as if they were all keeping something from her.</p><br/><p>When she saw that Mu Ye still seemed to be thinking about something, she decided to leave him alone. She was extremely sleepy since Cang Baicao\u2019s medicine contained soothing properties, so she decided to head back to the room to sleep.</p><br/><p>At night, Baili Yu returned, travel-worn, with Ye Chuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Ye Chuan watched as Baili Yu rushed into the room. He only came out after ascertaining that Tang Doudou was sleeping peacefully on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Chuan, hurry and get in touch with Jun Xin and Feng Long to tell them to make their move against Yun Hai. I won\u2019t be able to return for the time being, so help me bring this to Jun Xin. Tell him he has full authority over everything. While at it, tell him that if he doesn\u2019t deal with everything, he\u2019s not allowed to come see Doudou.\u201d Inwardly, he apologized to Jun Xin. Baili Yu had taken the thumb ring from around Tang Doudou\u2019s neck and he now handed it to Ye Chuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, the Alliance Head Command Tablet is in Yiling\u2019s hands. Have Jun Xin publically announce that Doudou is no longer the Alliance Head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan had a bad premonition as he listened to all of this. It was like Baili Yu was tying up loose ends. \u201cMaster, you\u2019re?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Ye Chuan. It\u2019s just that, it\u2019s been so many years. I\u2019m exhausted. As of now, I just want to be with Doudou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Master! We\u2019ve worked so hard for so many years. Is it worth it to give all of it up just for a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s worth it or not, you\u2019ll understand in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu clasped his hands behind his back and turned away from Ye Chuan. \u201cI will never betray her in this lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan squeezed the thumb ring in his palm. He recalled what Yun Hai had said when he came back. He had said that Master has fallen prey to lust and was no longer the master of the past\u2026</p><br/><p>But.. Ye Chuan recalled how Baili Yu had gradually started smiling more ever since Tang Doudou appeared. He hesitated for a long time, but in the end, he cupped his fist and said, \u201cThis subordinate will go do so now. Master, take care.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan bowed again. When he turned to leave, his eyes were resolute.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu turned around to watch him leave, then sighed softly. Ye Chuan, hopefully, you won\u2019t disappoint me!</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Big evil spirit, is that you?\u201d murmured Tang Doudou. She reflexively felt for the ring that was usually on her neck. When she couldn\u2019t find it, she abruptly sat up in alarm. \u201cWhere\u2019s my ring?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu pushed open the door and walked in with a smile. \u201cWife, you\u2019re awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili- Baili Yu, I think I lost the thumb ring!\u201d That was their engagement item! They even used their hair to make that necklace, Baili Yu had proposed to her with it! But it\u2019s gone! And she didn\u2019t even know when she had lost it. If she hadn\u2019t woken up from a nightmare, she wouldn\u2019t have even noticed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a thumb ring. This husband can buy you a lot more some other day.\u201d Baili Yu could tell that she was panicking, but he couldn\u2019t help but tease her.</p><br/><p>As expected, Tang Doudou immediately glowered at him. \u201cHow is that the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it not the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou gave that ring to me when you were asking me to marry you! The meaning\u2019s completely different!\u201d Tang Doudou looked at him unhappily. Why was he so calm even though she lost the ring? Could it be that the ring wasn\u2019t important to him at all?</p><br/><p>When Baili Yu saw her expression, he knew that she was thinking along the wrong lines again. He stroked her nose gently and said, \u201cSilly little pumpkin, what nonsense are you thinking now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wrinkled her nose and lay back down unhappily. \u201cIt definitely fell off when that giant snake sent me flying. Haa, there\u2019s no choice but to head back to look for it when there\u2019s a chance. Hopefully no one takes it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly girl, I was the one that took the ring.\u201d When Baili Yu saw that she was concerned about the ring to the point that she wanted to head back to the sinkhole to look for it, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to tease her anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you took it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pouted and turned her head away. When she recalled how he seemed to have been keeping things from her the entire time lately, her nose started to sting. She just wanted to live happily with him, but even though he seemed to know everything about her, she didn\u2019t know anything about him. They were clearly this close together, but for some reason, she still felt seas and mountains apart from him. She really hated this feeling. She often had to force herself not to think about it, because she was afraid that if she thought about it, she would discover that Baili Yu actually didn\u2019t love her as much as she thought he did.</p><br/><p>However, now she couldn\u2019t stop this torrent of thoughts and her tears started falling like a broken string of pearls. Baili Yu\u2019s heart ached when he saw her crying silently.</p><br/><p>He had said that he would never let her get hurt again, but he kept hurting her. He really deserved to die.</p><br/><p>When he was facing her, he couldn\u2019t even see any resemblance of his past calm and collected self. Whenever she cried, he would always be so flustered that he didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>His heart ached to see her cry, but he didn\u2019t know how to comfort her or explain things to her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the starry sky. He recalled the time when they had watched the stars carefreely, so he lifted Tang Doudou and said, \u201cDoudou, let\u2019s go look at the stars.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

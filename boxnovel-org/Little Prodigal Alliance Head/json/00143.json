He didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger finally snapped back to his senses and went \u2018Ah.\u2019 He went over to slap Jin Longbiao awake, before walking toward Xiao Dao.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao thought Yu Fenger was here to continue robbing them. He said with a cold expression, \u201cDo you know who she is!? Golden Wind Jade Dew, you guys should be prepared to die without a burial site for having injured her today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he spoke fiercely, he was despairing within. If Golden Wind Jade Dew really killed Tang Doudou, she couldn\u2019t be brought back to life even if Master hacked them to pieces.</p><br/><p>Lady Doudou, I\u2019m nothing but a servant, what reason was there for you to stake your life in order to save me!?</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger had been scared out of his wits by Tang Doudou earlier. They had been mountain bandits for many years but have never taken a life before. They only acted fiercely in order to scare people. Even if Tang Doudou didn\u2019t act earlier, Long Jinbiao still wouldn\u2019t have really crushed Xiao Dao to death.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing Tang Doudou currently in this condition, he started feeling sympathy for her. \u201cYou, don\u2019t misunderstand. I came over because I wanted to say that you should hurry and find a doctor to treat her since she\u2019s heavily injured\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Xiao Dao was stunned for a moment before he immediately berated himself for being a blockhead. He lifted Tang Doudou up and wanted to run.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Yu Fenger hastily moved to block his way. With a face full of disdain, he said, \u201cWhere are you planning on taking her? This place is still half a day\u2019s distance from Cloud Semblance Garrison. Do you know how long it\u2019ll take going by foot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao stopped. He had no idea what to do.</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger nudged Jin Longbiao who was still blanking out and said to Xiao Dao, \u201cOur mountain stronghold is just ahead. Why don\u2019t you bring her to the stronghold and settle her down first? There\u2019s a doctor in our stronghold and he can make sure her condition doesn\u2019t worsen for the time being. After that, you can go and bring a good doctor here. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao didn\u2019t speak. There was no doubt that this was currently the most feasible method. He had also received internal injuries before so he knew it was very likely that Tang Doudou would die due to her internal organs bleeding before they even make it to Cloud Semblance Garrison.</p><br/><p>As if he could tell what Xiao Dao was thinking, Yu Fenger continued, \u201cEven though we, Golden Wind Jade Dew, are mountain bandits, we\u2019ve always abided by the rules: only seek money, not lives. As long as you give us money, we will definitely look after this person carefully for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao was convinced. It was both because there was no other choice right now and because although Golden Wind Jade Dew were notorious in the Jianghu, there had never been any news of them killing people.</p><br/><p>Forget it, death laid to the left and the right. At least there was still a thin chance of survival if he went to their stronghold!</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao turned around and warned, \u201cDon\u2019t try anything funny or I\u2019ll make you guys pay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he had agreed to the idea, Yu Fenger\u2019s smile immediately became even brighter than a flower as he nodded hastily. \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Xiao Dao felt like something was off.</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger\u2019s abnormal reaction caused Xiao Dao to be more on guard inwardly. He silently followed the two bandits towards the so-called stronghold. Behind their backs, he left a sign, requesting for assistance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao glanced back to check those signs that only people from the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce would understand. Only then did he relax. Following Yu Fenger\u2019s lead, they returned to the bandits\u2019 stronghold: Green Summit Stronghold.</p><br/><p>After settling Tang Doudou down, Yu Fenger called for the stronghold\u2019s doctor. \u201cOld Man Yu, hurry and come over here, come take a look at this gongzi\u2019s condition! Is he about to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had just finished speaking when a sloppy-looking old man wobbled in. If Tang Doudou had been awake, she definitely would have recognized this old man. He was the doctor that Cang Baicao had disguised himself as the last time Baili Yu got injured!</p><br/><p>He walked in while talking noisily. When he saw that the person lying on the bed was Tang Doudou, his facial color underwent a huge change and he immediately turned around to run.</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao who witnessed this was completely confused. Could it be that this doctor knew Tang Doudou?</p><br/><p>How could Yu Fenger possibly allow Old Man Yu to run? He shot a look over and Jin Laobiao who was standing by the door immediately picked Old Man Yu up by his front lapel and threw him in front of the bed. \u201cRunning? Do you believe me when I say I\u2019ll break your legs!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing this violent Jin Longbiao, the unarmed and defenseless Old Man Yu\u2019s expression turned serious as he said coldly, \u201cJin Longbiao, if you keep acting so fierce towards me, I won\u2019t help you treat your injuries next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit wasting time and check his condition!\u201d Jin Longbiao didn\u2019t pay any attention to Old Man Yu\u2019s threat at all and simply cracked his knuckles loudly.</p><br/><p>\u2018When a scholar encounters a soldier, even if there\u2019s logic it can\u2019t be conveyed clearly.\u2019 Old Man Yu shook his head with a crying look on his face, then turned around to check Tang Doudou\u2019s pulse.</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao who was standing next to the bed watched Old Man Yu nervously. When he saw that Old Man Yu\u2019s brows furrow, he blurted out, \u201cDoctor, how is she?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Man Yu shook his head without speaking.</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao felt as though his heart had plunged into ice. He fell backwards weakly. It\u2019s over\u2026</p><br/><p>He waited for Old Man Yu to pronounce his final sentence. Old Man Yu finally put down Tang Doudou\u2019s wrist and said to Xiao Dao with a calm expression, \u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019ll recover after sleeping a few days!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine? How could she be fine?\u201d Xiao Dao\u2019s face was filled with disbelief. He pulled Old Man Yu who was leaving to a stop. \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t examine her wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoungster, you sure are weird. It\u2019s enough that you\u2019re doubting my medical expertise, but how could you be so blackhearted as to hope for someone to not be fine?\u201d said Old Man Yu, peeved.</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao released him in embarrassment. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. It\u2019s just that back then, she vomited a lot of blood\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, check for yourself ah. Her pulse is calm and strong, how does she seem anywhere close to death? Humph!\u201d Old Man Yu flung his sleeve back and gave a cold humph. \u201cIgnorant!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he lifted his chin arrogantly and walked out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao thought about it a little, before lowering his head and picked up Tang Doudou\u2019s wrist. After a moment, shock appeared on his face. The pulse was as Old Man Yu said: it was normal to the point it couldn\u2019t be any more normal.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The sight of the beautiful couple strolling on the streets attracted many looks.</p><br/><p>In a small garrison like this, it was already rare for there to be someone good-looking, so they\u2019ve never seen people as beautiful as this.</p><br/><p>In the end, every time Tang Doudou saw something she liked and was about to have Baili Yu buy it for her, the shop owner would directly gift it to her and refuse to accept any money. It was to the point that she didn\u2019t even dare to look at the goods anymore. She glanced, annoyed, towards Baili Yu who had been accompanying her without saying much this whole time. She sighed, then said, \u201cHow about we go somewhere else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu rubbed her hair dotingly. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>So the two headed to the nearby West Wind City in a grandiose manner. They caused another ruckus at the city gates, then entered the city without much trouble. After they entered, Tang Doudou discovered that West Wind City was actually not much smaller than Huai City and there were a lot of people from the martial arts community. There were even quite a few people that she recognized.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou then glanced behind the carriage. \u201cHuh? Why didn\u2019t that Palace Head Fu follow us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife seems to really like Palace Head Fu?\u201d Unexpectedly, this was how Baili Yu responded.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou recalled Fu Yunliu\u2019s abundant figure, she was struck with envy again. She mentally measured her little meat buns against those surging waves and shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t like her. Her figure\u2019s too good, I can\u2019t help but envy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer figure is good?\u201d asked Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu never wasted words, so the fact that he asked this twice meant that there was something he was trying to point out. Tang Doudou asked, \u201cHey, big evil spirit, what\u2019s with all those questions? Could it be that you like her? You know, actually, that\u2019s not unreasonable. After all, Fu Yunliu\u2019s figure really is impressive, even a woman like me is tempted and you\u2019re a normal man after all. So it\u2019s fine. If you like her, you should just be brave and admit it! I won\u2019t mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Did he sound like he meant that?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was made speechless by Tang Doudou\u2019s ability to fly off the normal trail of thought. He was a normal man, but he would only be interested in normal women, and he would only be interested in the woman he liked\u2026 When his thoughts reached this point, he chuckled. He had almost been led into the gutter by this girl.</p><br/><p>But in short, he would never have any interest in someone like Fu Yunliu.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly girl.\u201d Baili Yu sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve encountered Fu Yunliu a long time ago. She\u2019s also someone of the Saint Tribes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way?\u201d It was now Tang Doudou\u2019s turn to be dumbfounded. When she first got here and started hearing about the Seven Great Saint Tribes, it had always been whispers here and there. Hardly anyone had known of their existence, but now there were people of the Saint Tribes everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember that Mandate of Heaven\u2019s Child?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded, then shook her head. \u201cFu Yunliu and Yuner? You have better not say that they\u2019re related.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFifteen years ago, the young son of the prime minister\u2019s family was only three years old. When he headed out to play with servants, someone kidnapped him. He was found three months later, but he had become dumb and could not grow like a normal child. Hence, he had been disregarded by the prime minister\u2019s family all the way until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you find out about something that happened so long ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to find out about things like this, you just have to ask around a little.\u201d Baili Yu said with a smile, \u201cIn addition, I had experienced this myself as well. I was only around four back then as well. I had left Wind Cloud Island with Master. We heard that a strange person had appeared and was kidnapping boys that were around the age of three. Master didn\u2019t mind and just continued rushing to Huai City with me. Just when we were about to reach Huai City, an accident happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were kidnapped?\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes went wide. She was surprised that someone actually dared to kidnap Baili Yu in front of his master, but at the same time, she was inwardly laughing. Back then, Baili Yu had definitely been tiny. Otherwise, why would he have been kidnapped even though the kidnapper was targeting children of around three?</p><br/><p>There was no way Baili Yu would know that she was thinking off tangent again. He nodded with a smile. \u201cMaster was very angry when I got kidnapped. He usually didn\u2019t meddle in the affairs of the Jianghu, but that time, he persistently hunted down the strange man and traced his whereabouts to the Seven Great Saint Tribes. While he was at it, he found that strange person\u2019s base and saved several thousand children. In that group, there was a child called Yuner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! So you and Yuner are actually old acquaintances?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s gaze turned slightly more serious and he glanced towards Tang Doudou meaningfully. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask about Fu Yunliu? I haven\u2019t mentioned her at all yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for you to confess of your own volition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, I think, before I confess, I should teach you a proper lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat lesson?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lesson about men and women!\u201d Baili Yu smirked as he looked over her. With a teasing tone, he said, \u201cWife should learn properly what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman so that you don\u2019t confuse the genders again. Otherwise, other people would laugh if they find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou covered her chest with both hands. Then her eyes narrowed slightly. She caught the meaning in Baili Yu\u2019s words, but she wasn\u2019t certain. \u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah! It\u2019s a murder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Tang Doudou was about to ask the crucial question, there came blood-curdling screams and the sounds of people running for their lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d It was quite a large ruckus, so Tang Doudou\u2019s expression turned serious.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu indicated for her not to panic and patted her stomach before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>He quickly lifted the curtain and took in the situation, then sat back down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid someone really die?\u201d Tang Doudou went up and grabbed his arm nervously.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they targetting us?\u201d If she knew earlier that they\u2019d end up in this much trouble, she wouldn\u2019t have come to the city and would\u2019ve just stayed in the little garrisons instead!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. From the looks of it, it\u2019s related to Palace Head Fu. We should just watch.\u201d Following that, a red light flashed beneath Baili Yu\u2019s sleeve and a small door opened on the side of the carriage. He carried Tang Doudou and flew out of the carriage, landing on top of the nearby building.</p><br/><p>The street was now mostly empty with only a few random things tumbling around on the ground and the disfigured corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person\u2019s\u2026!\u201d When Tang Doudou got a look at that corpse, she covered her mouth in shock.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

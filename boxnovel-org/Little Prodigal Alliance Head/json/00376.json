There was probably some other condition, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have gotten so many people to come here.</p><br/><p>As she had expected, he soon continued, \u201cHowever, Alliance Head must make a trip back to Huai City during the fifteenth of this month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must return to attend the funeral of the Xiao family\u2019s young master!\u201d These words had been spinning around in Elder Yu\u2019s chest this entire time and he was relieved to finally get it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Xiao family\u2019s young master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Ziyu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ziyu\u2019s funeral? Why did she have to participate? And with the identity of alliance head?</p><br/><p>When Xiao Ziyu was brought up, the four families that had just been observing this entire time finally reacted.</p><br/><p>The master of the Xiao family got up. He was past seventy years old, but his build was still very tall and valiant. He cupped his fist towards Tang Doudou, then his steady voice appeared like a giant bell. \u201cAlliance Head Li, I\u2019ll have to trouble you about Ziyu\u2019s matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily returned the salute. \u201cSenior Xiao, it\u2019s no trouble. However, I\u2019m still not clear about what happened, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She glanced at the relieved Elder Yu, then continued, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to help with anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Qian lowered his hands and stood up straight. His turbid eyes shone with sharp light as he said, \u201cAlliance Head Li is the only one that can handle this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he started explaining, \u201cA couple days ago, that disappointing grandson of mine, Xiao Ziyu, was murdered and even his corpse was taken. I mobilized my entire clan to find the one behind it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xiao Qian got to this part, he gritted his teeth angrily. However, his eyes contained the unbearable sadness the elderly feels when they have to see off their children ahead of them. \u201cWe managed to find his corpse, but it was so ruined that we couldn\u2019t put it fully back together!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old man endured the pain and brought Ziyu\u2019s corpse back to the clan to bury, but that bastard actually wasn\u2019t done and at night, used blood to write on the Xiao Residence walls that he would come back on the fifteenth to take back Ziyu\u2019s corpse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was stunned. Xiao Ziyu was too pitiful. She had only seen him once, but he had seemed to be a pretty good young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bastard\u2019s whereabouts are always changing and his martial arts are very strong. This old man had exchanged blows with him and managed to barely win, but could not bring him to justice, so this old man had no choice but to ask Alliance Head for help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou fell silent after hearing this. She didn\u2019t immediately agree. Although she felt sympathy for him and was sad about what happened to Xiao Ziyu, this matter was seriously very troublesome.</p><br/><p>The Xiao family\u2019s power was nothing to sneer at.</p><br/><p>At the very least, this was what she had seen. The Xiao family was the most well-known out of all of the four large families and their residence had layer upon layer of defense. Most of the time, it\u2019d probably be hard for even a fly to get in.</p><br/><p>However, that person had been able to write on the walls of the residence without getting caught. This meant that he not only had strong martial arts, he was also very skilled in infiltration.</p><br/><p>In addition, he was clearly vicious and heartless, since he wouldn\u2019t even let off a corpse.</p><br/><p>And then there was the fact that not even the master of the Xiao family had been able to capture him, so wouldn\u2019t she be seeking death by challenging him with what little bit of martial arts she knew?</p><br/><p>But if she refused, then Xiao Qian would definitely hold this against her. Influential doting grandfathers were very fearsome, she had no desire to have this person as an enemy.</p><br/><p>Just as she was feeling conflicted, she suddenly remembered that the other families were also here. Xiao Qian\u2019s motive in coming here was clear, but why were the other families here?</p><br/><p>Just to see the show?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t possible!</p><br/><p>After being silent a while, Tang Doudou said sadly, \u201cActually, Young Sir Xiao and I happened to meet once. Who would\u2019ve expected that at such a young age, he\u2019d\u2026 Haaa. Senior Xiao, my condolences.\u201d</p><br/><p>The light in Xiao Qian\u2019s eyes became even more intense. \u201cI vow to personally avenge Ziyu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Senior Xiao, these people\u2019s conduct is truly hateful. They must be brought to justice! There\u2019s no way I could just stand by and watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though she didn\u2019t agree to go back on the fifteenth, she also didn\u2019t reject Xiao Qian\u2019s request. Her reply was perfect and no one could pick fault at it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Qian furrowed his brows slightly and his expression darkened a little. In the eyes of others, Tang Doudou looked as if she didn\u2019t fully agree or reject this request, but in his eyes, the fact that she hadn\u2019t agreed was already a rejection. When he recalled all those things he had secretly done for Cloud City these past years, he inwardly laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>Even if she refused, he had ways to make her agree.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had no idea that Xiao Qian was that petty despite his age and was still silently praising herself for her intelligence. Suddenly, she saw that Jun Xin was making gestures to her from the top of a wall. He seemed to be telling her to agree to going to the Xiao family residence!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How did it manage to get such a high approval from you, Pavilion Master?\u201d Lou Qingyun probably felt like there was no possibility of escaping, so his tone returned to his old casual style as he smiled ingratiatingly, \u201cThis way, I\u2019d be able to brag in hell when the time comes \u2013 that I got cut off in my prime because my blood was too high quality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh quality?\u201d Xin Yue laughed a little, \u201cIt is high quality blood indeed. I think you\u2019re also curious about this, Li Xueyi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh she was quite curious, but she didn\u2019t plan to give up resistance here. She was still thinking of ways to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cI indeed wish to know about Pavilion Master Xin Yue\u2019s clever scheme.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then heard Xin Yue say, \u201cI wonder if you two still remember that antique lamp?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately pricked up her ears to listen carefully when the antique lamp was brought up..</p><br/><p>\u201cThat antique lamp is an object from the distant past, no one alive still knows its secrets and uses after it was passed down so long. A hundred years ago however, someone discovered a secret about it after studying it meticulously\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That person\u2019s name was Feng Qingge. He was a madman, crazed about analyzing all the strange things of the world. A certain opportunity allowed him to obtain this antique lamp and gather all the passed down myths in ancient texts. Thus, he started the long process of studying the lamp. Fifty years ago, he finally discovered the secret of the antique lamp.</p><br/><p>It could be said that it\u2019s a secret which could shake the entire world.</p><br/><p>Xin Yue didn\u2019t say what that secret was, but it was probably related to the Black Demonic Nightcrawlers. Why would she bring this up otherwise? As Tang Doudou made her conjectures, Xin Yue continued, \u201cIn any case, the antique lamp had an additional usage ever since that time. It had the ability to verify blood quality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more item that works in a pair with the antique lamp. As long as that type of blood approaches the antique lamp, the other object will go through an unusual change\u2026.You guys should understand now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Understand a feather of what? It\u2019s not easy to link things together when you\u2019re masking everything like this, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t understand but Lou Qingyun did. He asked again, \u201cThen how did Pavilion Master know that feeding the Black Demonic Nightcrawler with this sort of blood is better than ordinary blood? It doesn\u2019t seem to be very connected?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many things in the world are connected from the start?\u201d Xin Yue gave a cold hmph as if disdaining Lou Qingyun\u2019s lack of knowledge. She also seemed to have ran out of patience again. After cursing softly, she spoke to Boss Qing, who was outside the hatchway, \u201cXiao Qing, go guard outside. I will help you take your revenge once I come out of seclusion!\u201d</p><br/><p>When revenge was brought up, Boss Qing became visibly happy and cheerfully gave an affirmation. As she pulled down the hatchway to a close, she said, \u201cThen, I shall congratulate Pavilion Master in advance for the success of your remarkable achievement in unifying the Jianghu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Her words made Xin Yue really happy. The sound of her laughter was exceptionally loud in this spacious area, \u201cNo, ben zuo doesn\u2019t just want to unify the Jianghu, ben zuo will unify the country! That so-called Lord of Cloud City will kneel below my foot to beg for mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Did she freaking go crazy?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently remarked before looking towards Lou Qingyun. She never expected that the antique lamp could even be used this way. It was practically even more overpowered than the laboratory tests of the modern era. It sounded pretty much like the stuff of legends.</p><br/><p>Looks like both her and Lou Qingyun had fallen into Xin Yue\u2019s trap. They had first gotten Lou Qingyun to accept a bet for the sake of Rutaceae Pavilion\u2019s signboard courtesan, Yun Yan, the bet being on how high a price he could sell the antique lamp for. In reality, this was because the antique lamp would be able to come into contact with more people on the street stall.</p><br/><p>Following that, she just happened to run into this antique lamp and linked it with the one she had seen before she transmigrated\u2026</p><br/><p>So this was her bad luck for running up to the muzzle of a gun herself. She wasn\u2019t someone that should\u2019ve appeared in Xin Yue\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>When her thoughts reached this point, Tang Doudou stuck up her middle finger towards the Old Heavens. Hell, could he possibly make her luck any worse!?E/C</p><br/><p>The reason Xin Yue\u2019s mood was so good was because she didn\u2019t only just find two usable food products, one of them was even Li Xueyi, who she hated so much her teeth itched. So how could she not be happy?</p><br/><p>Speaking of Li Xueyi, their relationship in reality wasn\u2019t as deep as she proposed it to be. She had only heard from Xiao Qing that Li Xueyi seemed to be different now. Other than the fact his personality went through a large change, he even forgot quite a lot of things. What was even stranger was that his martial arts seemed to have disappeared.</p><br/><p>That was why she tried using some words to test him earlier. As expected, he was as Xiao Qing had described. He wasn\u2019t like the ruthless and untamed Li Xueyi from before, but more so like a little lady. As for whether his martial arts were still present, it was very easy to figure out. When Xiao Qing opened the hatchway earlier, if Li Xueyi\u2019s martial arts were still present, he should have already rushed out rather than staying here to waste so many words.</p><br/><p>However, all of this didn\u2019t matter. All she wanted was that attractive fresh blood.</p><br/><p>The more she thought about it, the less Xin Yue was able to hold back the excitement in her heart. She was so close to succeeding and breaking away from this damned place. She can finally go out to feel the sunlight again!</p><br/><p>The clinking sounds of iron chains transmitted over from the darkness. Tang Doudou gulped, her throat a bit dry. Is Xin Yue really a strange creature? Why would there be the sounds of iron chains otherwise?</p><br/><p>Because the hatchway had been closed, this place had once again returned to being dark. Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t exactly tell where Xin Yue was. All she could hear was that sound getting closer and closer.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know where Lou Qingyun went off to either. Tang Doudou could only hear her own rapid heartbeat.</p><br/><p>Meow ah!E/C2 Could it be she\u2019ll really have to die here today?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a large hand grabbed her from the dark, startling her so much that she quivered, thinking it was Xin Yue next to her. She opened her mouth to scream, but that person seemed to have anticipated it and covered her mouth, \u201cAlliance Head Li, don\u2019t panic. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s Lou Qingyun?</p><br/><p>How come he can move?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you go if you don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. Lou Qingyun let go and continued to speak in a low voice, \u201cI have a way to get us out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seriously, it turned out the reason he was silent this whole time was because he was thinking of a way to get out? Just what idea did he come up with? Is it something reliable? However, it wasn\u2019t a good time for her to ask right now. Lou Qingyun continued in quiet voice, \u201cHowever, I will require Alliance Head Li\u2019s cooperation. Wonder if Alliance Head Li is willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily nodded.</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun explained his plan to her simply. Luckily, the sound of Xin Yue\u2019s chains were particularly loud in this empty space and covered up the sound of his voice. That was why Xin Yue didn\u2019t discover what they were up to the entire time they were talking.</p><br/><p>However, her surprised and chilling voice soon came from the darkness, \u201cSurnamed Lou brat, I\u2019ve really underestimated you!\u201d</p><br/><p>She probably only cried out surprised upon getting to where Lou Qingyun originally was and discovering that there wasn\u2019t anyone there. Since this place was sealed however, and with the hatchway above them being the only exit, she wasn\u2019t worried about Lou Qingyun trying anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, the more tormented the strong prey is, the more I like it. Only that type of fresh blood would have more liveliness. Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xin Yue stopped walking forward after she laughed, as if she was concentrating to hear where the two people were.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe probably can\u2019t see since martial arts practitioners should be capable of confirming our position by sight and don\u2019t need to rely on sound\u2026\u201d Seeing this, Lou Qingyun moved towards Tang Doudou\u2019s ear again to speak softly.</p><br/><p>With the exception of Baili Yu, Tang Doudou never had such close contact with any other man, so she uncomfortably turned away without speaking.</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun had to use inner strength to speak in order to prevent Xin Yue from hearing.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have martial arts or inner strength, so Xin Yue would definitely notice if she spoke.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun\u2019s plan seemed to have factored in the assumption that she knew martial arts. Since she didn\u2019t know martial arts, would that affect the plan?</p><br/><p>When this thought occurred to Tang Doudou, her body immediately became taut. She then pulled Lou Qingyun\u2019s arm. Too distracted to care about being discovered by Xin Yue, she said rapidly in a small voice, \u201cLou Qingyun, I have no martial arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>She instantly felt Lou Qingyun\u2019s body stiffen. Before he even opened his mouth, Xin Yue laughed loudly and a strong wind swept over. She was actually dragging the iron chains with her as she flew over.</p><br/><p>A fishy stench propagated. Tang Doudou had to close her eyes since she was so smothered by that scent. Luckily, Lou Qingyun reacted extremely quickly and pulled her to the ground, \u201cDon\u2019t talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Tang Doudou dare talk anymore? She had already covered her mouth herself.</p><br/><p>Xin Yue fell to the ground like a heavy hammer, shaking the rice straw. The strong moldy smell that arose almost suffocated the two. The fall and the tumbling also intensified the injury on Lou Qingyun\u2019s arm, causing him to groan with pain.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wanted to ask him how his injury was, but she was afraid of being discovered by Xin Yue, so she could only use her hand to help shield Lou Qingyun\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>The two only stopped rolling when they knocked into the wall. Lou Qingyun reached out and pulled her up. He spoke with a bit of blame and anger, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier? Now, this will be hard to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was silent. In reality, she also knew that Lou Qingyun definitely wasn\u2019t bringing her along out of the goodness of his heart, just like the way she didn\u2019t plan to save him. It was just that the odds of success were currently higher with two people cooperating.</p><br/><p>Who asked for the only exit to be above their heads?</p><br/><p>However, the fact that Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know martial arts was left out of the plan. This caused Lou Qingyun to be exceptionally depressed. He couldn\u2019t believe that he was actually this unlucky. Li Xueyi, who was rumored to have extraordinary martial arts skills, actually lost his martial arts at this crucial moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right ah. Are you really Li Xueyi?\u201d</p><br/><p>How can martial arts just disappear like that?</p><br/><p>And he also hadn\u2019t heard anything about Li Xueyi getting injured recently. The more Lou Qingyun thought about it, the more weird it seemed. As the thought that Li Xueyi might mean something along the lines of having gotten poisoned, he reached out to check Li Xueyi\u2019s pulse.</p><br/><p>The moment his inner strength came into contact with Tang Doudou\u2019s hand however, it was unexpectedly rejected. In addition, the inner strength was so strong it almost devoured him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li, this isn\u2019t the time to make jokes!\u201d Seeing that Tang Doudou\u2019s inner strength was still intact, and the fact that Tang Doudou had almost caused them to be crushed by Xin Yue earlier, Lou Qingyun was extremely angry. He flung away Tang Doudou\u2019s hand and moved to stand away from her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was completely speechless with the way Lou Qingyun touched and spoke to her. She had no idea what Lou Qingyun meant, but was also too scared to say anything, so she could only stay silent sullenly.</p><br/><p>As for Xin Yue, she didn\u2019t get angry after they escaped. On the contrary, she was really true to her word. The more lively the prey was, the happier she was. Therefore, she stopped again to identify the direction of the two.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou really wanted to ask Lou Qingyun what exactly happened, but Lou Qingyun was very far away this time. She felt around in front with her hands for a while but still didn\u2019t find him, so she started blindly walking in the dark. She thought that she was walking very cautiously, but she had underestimated the ears of martial art practitioners.</p><br/><p>She heard another cold humph come from Xin Yue\u2019s direction, then Xin Yue flew over so fast the iron chain created eye-piercing sparks as it dragged across the floor. Before Tang Doudou even had the time to react, a withered stinky hand had abruptly clutched her neck.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

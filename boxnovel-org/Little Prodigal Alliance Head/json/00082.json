But earlier, there was a Big Brother that was as pretty as Big Sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA Big Brother even prettier than Big Sister? Does Yuner know who he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl helped him up as she quietly asked.</p><br/><p>When the two lowered their heads and started quietly walking towards the door, a pair of embroidered red shoes appeared in their vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner, where are you heading off to?\u201d</p><br/><p>A low voice came from above the two\u2019s heads. Yuner was startled so much he scuttled backwards to hide behind the young girl\u2019s back and spoke with a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMo-mother, Y-Yuner isn\u2019t going anywhere to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person that came had a strong imposing aura. Her outfit was poised and luxurious, her facial features beautiful and dignified and on her face was a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I heard you got into trouble again? You\u2019re really such a little troublemaker, always causing Mother to fret.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman that was speaking was precisely the matron of the Bai household and Bai Lianhua\u2019s aunt, Bai Yu.</p><br/><p>Bai Yu cast a mild glance at the two timid people as she walked into the courtyard leading a line of servants.</p><br/><p>Yuner tightly clutched the young girl\u2019s arm without letting go. He kept his head lowered the entire time, not daring to even glance towards Bai Yu.</p><br/><p>The young girl gently patted Yuner\u2019s hand and gave him a slight smile.</p><br/><p>It was very hard to imagine that the beautiful and intelligent Bai Yu was actually this foolish Yuner\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I-I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuner saw the warm smile on Bai Yu\u2019s face but he felt extremely afraid and couldn\u2019t stop himself from hiding behind the young girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady San Yu, wonder how confident you are regarding this competition? The opponent is the number one cook of Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce and her culinary arts skills isn\u2019t something that ordinary kitchen maids would be able to compete with.\u201d Bai Yu glanced at that girl. Her tone was quite courteous, but also filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>The young girl that was addressed as San Yu lowered her hands and straightened her back as she replied, \u201cMatron has no need to worry. San Yu will definitely win this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Yu, it\u2019s probably not a good idea for me to head over like this, right?\u201d Right after they left that courtyard, Tang Doudou started tugging at her clothes. She saw that kitchen maids and servant girls were walking around everywhere while she was the only one in a man\u2019s outfit. It was exceptionally eye-catching, and she couldn\u2019t help but scratch her head awkwardly.</p><br/><p>When Meng Yu saw this scene, she went \u2018ah\u2019, and pulled Tang Doudou to the side before looking her up and down. \u201cAiy this memory of mine. How could I have forgotten such an important matter!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do now?\u201d Tang Doudou asked with a helpless tone.</p><br/><p>Meng Yu looked towards her own clothes, then at Tang Doudou\u2019s delicate and pretty face. She laughed \u2018hehe\u2019 and said, \u201cThere is a way, but I\u2019ll have to ask Alliance Head da ren to endure a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hah?</p><br/><p>One hour later, in the servant quarters of Bai Residence, Meng Yu anxiously paced back and forth outside a door. From time to time, she would shoot an impatient glance towards the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is he still in there? Could it be that he doesn\u2019t know how to wear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we keep delaying, we\u2019ll run out of time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Yu muttered continuously. If she knew earlier that this was going to happen, she wouldn\u2019t have come up with this rotten idea. Meng Yu scratched her head and was debating over whether she should head in to help or not when the door opened.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the person that came out, Meng Yu immediately froze on the spot. Her jaw dropped and only after a while was she able to stammer disbelievingly, \u201cA-a-alliance Head Li\u2026 i-is that you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me ah. Aren\u2019t I stunning? Hm?\u201d Tang Doudou folded her hands behind her back and laughed cheerfully as she walked out. Her dimples were like flowers, causing Meng Yu to go into a daze as she looked.</p><br/><p>Meng Yu sighed with all her heart. Alliance Head Li\u2019s female disguise is truly way too beautiful.</p><br/><p>It was just an ordinary servant\u2019s short-sleeved garment, yet when Tang Doudou wore it, it gave off a fresh and lively feeling. The casually tied up ponytail in combination with the faint yellow dress was particularly charming. With those crafty, big, black eyes and face that was like a china doll\u2019s, it truly caused people to be incapable of tearing their eyes away.</p><br/><p>\u201cStunning, stunning!\u201d Meng Yu snapped back to her senses and walked up to pull Tang Doudou. \u201cI was just thinking earlier that Alliance Head Li would definitely look good in female clothing. I never thought it would actually be to this extent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled, delighted. She was really happy from the bottom of her heart that she was finally able to wear female clothing.</p><br/><p>She was finally able to let her little white bunnies out! This feeling was practically even more refreshing than eating ten bags of spicy strips!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, what\u2019s this?\u201d Meng Yu pointed at Tang Doudou\u2019s chest as she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, hehe, if you\u2019re going to put on a disguise then of course you have to put on the full set. I stuffed some clothing in there, haha!\u201d Tang Doudou laughed, then changed the topic. \u201cThat\u2019s right, since I\u2019ve already put on a female disguise, you can\u2019t keep calling me Alliance Head Li this and Alliance Head Li that. If someone hears, that\u2019d be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Yu found it reasonable as well. \u201cThen what do I call you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Doudou!\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s expression was pretty happy. Now, she has finally completely become herself!</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Doudou? Tang Doudou\u2026\u201d Meng Yu repeated this name for a while. Her eyes then lit up. \u201cThis name is not bad ah! It really fits Alli\u2026 Doudou, your current appearance!\u201d</p><br/><p>She almost called the wrong name. But after she called this name a couple more times, she felt that this name was coming out of her lips much more smoothly. She couldn\u2019t help but also giggle foolishly as she stared at Tang Doudou\u2019s face, feeling as if she could never get enough of it.</p><br/><p>How could Tang Doudou stand Meng Yu looking at her like this? Tang Doudou pulled Meng Yu\u2019s hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while and we still need to prepare the things for the competition!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the competition was brought up, Meng Yu immediately returned to her senses and slapped her head. \u201cAiy, look at this memory of mine. I almost ended up forgetting the main matter. Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. If we end up late we\u2019ll be doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll make it in time!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the two arrived at the competition area chatting and laughing, all the kitchen helpers of Plum Garden that were waiting there rushed up anxiously to them as if something was on fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo, Meng Yu, my great auntie ah! Where did you run off to!? We were searching everywhere for you but couldn\u2019t find you. The competition\u2019s almost about to start!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Yu waved her large hand. \u201cWhat are you guys getting into a fluster about? Have you guys prepared all the materials?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all prepared, aren\u2019t we here waiting for you to check them?\u201d The kitchen maid in charge of preparing the ingredients looked around, then sneakily whispered to Meng Yu, \u201cEarlier, I went to take a look at the Bai Residence\u2019s kitchen. This time it\u2019s bad ah. I couldn\u2019t understand anything that they prepared. And that kitchen maid named San Yu, they say she\u2019s the one that drew the lead strip* for this year\u2019s cooking competition!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cpulling the leading strip\u201d means to have obtained the qualifications to appear onstage for the competition first.</p><br/><p>The strip is a bamboo stick with words written on it. Pulling strips was an old style of gambling and getting an inscribed strip signified a sure win. A strip without words varied in meaning. \u2018The short strip\u2019 is often the worst to pull.</p><br/><p>\u201cShoo, shoo! Stop extinguishing your own impressiveness with other people\u2019s ambitions. Even if she\u2019s impressive, I, Meng Yu, am also not a herbivore. It\u2019s just this year\u2019s leading strip, what\u2019s there to be afraid of? Don\u2019t forget that we\u2019re members of the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce!\u201d Meng Yu had long heard of who her opponent was. If she didn\u2019t feel any pressure, she wouldn\u2019t have gone to find Tang Doudou. It\u2019s just that at this time, there was no way she could let her imposing manner fall behind, right!?</p><br/><p>Morale is also abnormally important in competitions!</p><br/><p>Meng Yu understood this very well. She then turned towards Tang Doudou who was behind her and asked, \u201cDoudou, have you looked at the menu I prepared earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did everyone notice Tang Doudou who was behind Meng Yu. They looked at her clever and delicate face and couldn\u2019t recall having seen her in Plum Garden before. Thus, they couldn\u2019t help but start making conjectures. The kitchen maid that had pulled Meng Yu earlier now whispered, \u201cMy dear great auntie ah, this couldn\u2019t be the helper you were talking about, right? Her fingers are all soft and white, what part of her looks like she\u2019s a skilled chef who often cooks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Qiu Ling, aren\u2019t you underestimating people? I\u2019ll have you know that Tang Doudou\u2019s culinary arts skill is no worse than mine!\u201d And she had been wondering what Qiu Ling was doing acting so secretively. Meng Yu didn\u2019t expect it had turned out to be such a small matter, so she just replied casually.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Qiu Ling looked again at Tang Doudou who seemed like a carefree and helpless little miss. No matter what, she couldn\u2019t stop worrying. However, since Meng Yu had already put things like this and since Meng Yu was also the main chef this time, she naturally couldn\u2019t say anything more. However, she felt a bit discontent.</p><br/><p>If it was the Tang Doudou from before, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear what they were saying, but now she could hear them clearly. It was most likely due to the fact that she now had inner strength.</p><br/><p>This counts as Li Xueyi having given her a benefit ah!</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou thought this, she rubbed her chin. Then, recalling the menu that Meng Yu had shown her before, she said, \u201cI saw it before. But I feel like ah, though the dishes are complicated and hard to make, it\u2019s not colorful and original enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Tang Doudou had brought up the points in which the dishes were lacking, Meng Yu immediately perked up and moved over to ask, \u201cThen, Doudou, what do you suggest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled mysteriously. \u201cWe\u2019ll still use this dish, but for the things, we\u2019ll switch it up a little!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSwitching things last moment? You sure imagine the wildest things! The competition doesn\u2019t allow for it since the menu and ingredients list has already been sent up to the judging panel! What difference is there between switching something and taking the initiative to admit defeat? I say, could it be that this is what you\u2019re planning?\u201d Qiu Ling couldn\u2019t bring herself to like Tang Doudou. Now that Tang Doudou said she wanted to switch something, Qiu Ling immediately erupted and started criticizing her.</p><br/><p>It was normal for Qiu Ling to be this doubtful as they didn\u2019t know each other and she didn\u2019t know about her capability. That was why Tang Doudou take offense at the dislike in her voice and explained, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I only want to switch out a few little things inside. They won\u2019t be able to tell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was filled with confidence so Meng Yu was pleased. Pulling Tang Doudou\u2019s hand, Meng Yu led her into their temporary kitchen shed.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ling followed behind the two, completely displeased as she muttered, \u201cWhen problems end up occurring, what are we supposed to tell Master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou heard this, she was bewildered. When did she end up angering this woman?</p><br/><p>Why did it feel like she was always targeting her?</p><br/><p>Meng Yu didn\u2019t have martial arts so she didn\u2019t hear Qiu Ling\u2019s muttering at all. She was currently wondering curiously about what things Tang Doudou could switch out that wouldn\u2019t be discovered. However, she thought for a long time and still couldn\u2019t figure it out, so she opened her mouth to ask Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after she opened her mouth, Tang Doudou made a \u2018shh\u2019 motion towards her. She shot a conniving glance towards Qiu Ling who was behind them and said with a smile, \u201cThe mysteries of heaven must not be revealed. You\u2019ll know soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t willing to tell, Meng Yu could only suppress the curiosity in her heart as they walked towards the kitchen shed. Meng Yu looked at the aids that had all finished preparing, then carefully examined the ingredients and seasonings multiple times. Finally nodding, she ordered, \u201cCarry these things to the competition stage first. Doudou and I will head over right after we change!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those aids nodded, then methodically started working.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou also looked at those ingredients and seasonings and saw that the preparations were of good quality. After seeing this and those mysterious kitchen tools Meng Yu had, Tang Doudou felt even more confident for this competition.</p><br/><p>However, beyond this heaven are other heavens, there are other geniuses besides this genius, so one must not be careless.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Yu, do you know how big the gap is between the opponent\u2019s cooking skill and yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Yu glanced at Qiu Ling who was commanding the servants not far away and said in a small voice, \u201cAhem, she\u2019s probably a little better than me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And you were still speaking so confidently earlier!?</p><br/><p>Seeing Meng Yu\u2019s embarrassed expression, Tang Doudou could only keep this exclamation inside her heart.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

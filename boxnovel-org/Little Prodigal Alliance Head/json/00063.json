My home isn\u2019t here!\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s tongue had loosened when she started drinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where\u2019s your home?\u201d Baili Yu asked.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at the hazy image of Baili Yu through the light and giggled. She stumbled to her feet. \u201cMy home, my home is\u2026 is, hehe, somewhere you can\u2019t find!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no place that exists under this heaven that I can\u2019t find.\u201d Baili Yu said mildly, before putting his wine cup down. \u201cAlliance Head Li has gotten drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDrunk? I\u2019m not drunk!\u201d Tang Doudou swayed left and right as she walked over to him. \u201cBaili Yu ah, even though I must admit that you\u2019re pretty capable, that place really is impossible for you to find. Impossible to find\u2026 hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>The words had just fallen when she sat down with a \u2018thump\u2019 onto the table next to Baili Yu. She snatched the wine cup that Baili Yu was just about to lift up and took another shot before saying, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s not mention those sad things anymore. Let\u2019s toast and get plastered! No one\u2019s leaving until we\u2019re smashed! Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the dim lantern lights, her entire little face was flushed red. Her gossamer eyes were impossible to unravel as she gazed at him. From her delicate red lips came the fragrance of wine that brushed his heart like feathers. Baili Yu\u2019s eyes slightly darkened as he reached out and pulled Tang Doudou, who was noisily exhorting for him to drink, into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, why did I fly up earlier?\u201d The alcohol was affecting her more and more. By now, Tang Doudou was drunk to the point she couldn\u2019t be any drunker. When she saw Baili Yu\u2019s handsome face magnified in front of her, she started giggling. \u201cLittle fella, you sure are pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, she pursed her lips and wrapped her two soft arms around the back of Baili Yu\u2019s head. With a lustful smile, she moved closer and said, \u201cPretty little fella, give Big Sis here a kiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Sis?</p><br/><p>A light flashed through Baili Yu\u2019s eyes as if he realized something. Following that, his long and narrow fox-like eyes narrowed as he gave a low chuckle. \u201cSo it was like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like this? Haha, it is like this, give me a kiss like this. An awesome one!\u201d Tang Doudou laughed with a \u2018hehe\u2019, completely unaware of what exactly was coming out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu lowered his gaze and looked at her silly and lovable drunk appearance. No wonder he had always felt that she had too strong of a feminine air, so it turned out that she was a woman from the start. No wonder he always felt something unusual towards her. With this, everything made sense.</p><br/><p>The Li Xueyi who was by nature unconventional, outstanding, wanton and unrestrained was actually a woman! It was truly a huge pleasant surprise!</p><br/><p>Just a couple cups of wine were enough to let him find out such a huge secret. This exchange had been quite worthwhile.</p><br/><p>Then, Baili Yu propped up his chin as he recalled the deal he made with the Lord of Cloud City last time. After considering it for so long, in the end, should he agree to it or not?</p><br/><p>Even though he had brought up that deal in front of Li Xueyi multiple times, in reality, he was just teasing her a little for fun. He hadn\u2019t actually agreed to that deal yet. Not to mention, the Lord of Cloud City had disappeared after the martial arts convention and there hadn\u2019t been any news of him at all.</p><br/><p>It was said that even Bai Feiyun hadn\u2019t been able to see him the last time he went to Cloud City.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s a big beauty right here offering you a kiss, give some reaction ah!\u201d Tang Doudou had pursed her lips half the day, but the other party wasn\u2019t reacting to her at all, so she immediately started whining unhappily.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu lowered his gaze to look at Tang Doudou\u2019s intoxicated, hazy eyes. He suddenly extended his hand to tip her chin upwards as his deep and magnetic voice sounded. \u201cIs Alliance Head Li seducing this one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeduce? Hehe, that\u2019s wrong!\u201d Tang Doudou peeled off his fingers one by one and giggled for a while. Then she sat up and lightly pushed Baili Yu over. Pressing him down onto the soft couch, she lightly winded a few strands of Baili Yu\u2019s silky black hair around her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s you! You\u2019re the one seducing me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s head was incomparably muddled right now. She couldn\u2019t make sense of what was going on at all. All she knew was that there was a very very handsome, seductive yao-like, ancient-styled man from the asceticism department* beneath her. His half narrowed eyes had flashed with an unknown light and that deep voice was filled with an alluring charm that was definitely trying to seduce her. Seduce her into committing a crime.</p><br/><p> \u2013 \u201casceticism department\u201d is internet slang. Typically used to describe good-looking men with an indifferent and elegant outward appearance whose personality is taciturn and cold. The most important characteristic is that they aren\u2019t moved by women and seem to have no desires, but in reality, they\u2019re not truly cold, just not that strongly attached to emotion. But once they fall in love, they\u2019ll be super passionate and completely not care about anyone else. To describe it in one sentence, it would be \u201cof few words, facial nerves paralyzed, expression cool; beauty sharp to the point they penetrate bone like knives\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? So I\u2019m the one seducing you?\u201d Baili Yu smiled even more happily. His eyes slightly narrowed as a dangerous light entered them. To actually push him down! The proverb that alcohol can even strengthen a mouse\u2019s guts was probably referring precisely to this?</p><br/><p>Then he\u2019d like to see just how daring this girl could get when drunk!</p><br/><p>The light in Baili Yu\u2019s eyes as he smiled dazzled Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes, so she reached out and covered them. \u201cHell, you\u2019re definitely a vixen that has come to seduce innocent young girls into committing crimes!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she had finished speaking, she felt a little weak and decided to just lie down on that broad chest. She wanted to find a comfortable position and rest for a while, but as she was moving, the sight of Baili Yu attracted her gaze. She was currently covering Baili Yu\u2019s eyes, so all that was exposed was his high nose bridge and his sensual lips; the corners of which were slightly raised as if inviting her to taste them\u2026</p><br/><p>Gulping, Tang Doudou widened her eyes as she stared at those sexy lips. Her head was filled with hoots telling her to \u2018kiss it, kiss it!\u2019</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t hold back anymore and her head moved downwards. A sudden flaming heat emerged in her lower abdomen. Simultaneously, in a lapse of rationality as her brain shut down, she pursed her lips and brought them closer to him.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s eyes were covered by her hands, but he knew every single move she was making. He sensed her approaching. Following that, a fresh and faint fragrance got closer and closer. The fragrance was like a little blossoming flower bud in spring, and his body was even starting to react a little!</p><br/><p>Just as Tang Doudou\u2019s lips neared Baili Yu\u2019s cheek, Baili Yu lightly lifted his eyebrows, and Tang Doudou immediately felt the sky and earth flip. When the sensations had stopped, her body had been covered by his and her chin was tilted upwards once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Xueyi has taken the initiative to offer your body, then this one won\u2019t be overly courteous anymore either!\u201d After saying so, he lowered his head. Silk-like strands of fine black hair spilled down, brushing onto the forehead, face, neck of the person beneath him\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was tickled to the point she felt uncomfortable. She slapped aside the hand that was tipping her chin up and mumbled, \u201cBehave.\u201d</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t heard what Baili Yu murmured at all.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu lowered his head as the image of Tang Doudou\u2019s rosy cheeks filled his eyes. His breathing gradually grew heavier and his gaze deepened. He would send someone to tell the Lord of Cloud City tomorrow that he was accepting this deal.</p><br/><p>But just as he was about to lower his body again, he discovered that Tang Doudou had fallen sound asleep in the middle of her mumbling.</p><br/><p>And she was even still smacking her lips as she rubbed her face into the fox fur with an extremely satisfied expression. Her restless hand felt all around, seemingly tugging at the blanket.</p><br/><p>Ha, after igniting a fire, you\u2019re going to sleep just like this on your own?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s lips hooked upwards in a trace of a self-mocking smile. As he looked at Tang Doudou\u2019s sleeping figure, he actually felt a little regretful. He sighed almost soundlessly. Just as he was about to get up, he was once again pulled back down by Tang Doudou who had been looking all around for the blanket. As two soft arms tightly wrapped around him, he heard her mutter, \u201cMy little angel, be good oh, don\u2019t run around, ok\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s brows jumped. She couldn\u2019t even sleep properly. And who was that \u2018little angel\u2019?</p><br/><p>The sound of even breathing filled the room again. This time she was probably completely asleep?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu lifted his hand. Several streams of wind flew over and the wooden room completely sunk into darkness. Baili Yu gently pulled apart the arms that were hugging him, before flipping around and laying down next to Tang Doudou. Taking out the blanket Tang Doudou had draped over him in the afternoon from behind the soft couch, with a single lift of his hand, he covered it over the two of them.</p><br/><p>After that, he also slowly closed his eyes as his lips hooked slightly upwards. What kind of reaction would she have tomorrow when she saw this scene?</p><br/><p> What kind of reaction Tang Doudou would have was something to be discussed later. Right now, Ye Chuan, who was guarding outside the door, was having extremely complicated emotions.</p><br/><p>After the lights in the room went out, his brain went blank. The only thing that continuously echoed in his brain was: Master, Master really was homosexual!?</p><br/><p>This, this was way too terrifying!</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan shuddered, then another thought came into his mind \u2013 now that he knew this secret, would he be \u2018kacha kacha\u2019-ed by Master?</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Chuan, as I thought, you really are here!\u201d Jun Xin flitted over from not far away. He looked at Ye Chuan who was spacing out and waved at him. \u201cWhat are you spacing out for? Where\u2019s Baili Yu? In the wooden house?\u201d</p><br/><p>Startled back to his senses by Jun Xin, Ye Chuan hurriedly saluted towards him in greeting. \u201cYoung Master Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your master over there?\u201d Jun Xin said as he pointed towards the wooden house at that side before starting to walk in that direction. Since Ye Chuan was here, Baili Yu would definitely be here as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jun, you can\u2019t go over there!\u201d Ye Chuan saw that he was about to head over and hurriedly blocked Jun Xin\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin asked, confused, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem!\u201d Ye Chuan realized he didn\u2019t know what to say after blocking Jun Xin. There\u2019s no way he could possibly tell Young Master Jun that Master and Li Xueyi were inside doing that, right?</p><br/><p>No way. In this entire garden, who besides Li Xueyi didn\u2019t know that Young Master Jun had been heading over every day these past nights to guard Li Xueyi?</p><br/><p>The only thing was that they didn\u2019t know exactly what good points that Li Xueyi had to actually cause both of them to fall for him.</p><br/><p>It must be known that even though these two usually didn\u2019t approach female charms, they were not homosexual at all either!</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan was also very at a loss as to what exactly was going on.</p><br/><p>Seeing those confused expressions flash through Ye Chuan\u2019s eyes, Jun Xin suddenly got a bad feeling. He continued interrogating, \u201cWho is your master with?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been looking for Tang Doudou the entire day, but still hadn\u2019t found her. In his anxiety, he went to find Baili Yu but still met with a dead end since Baili Yu had also disappeared.</p><br/><p>So he had searched all around the plum sea again. At the very end, when he returned to Plum Garden, he heard Meng Yu say that Baili Yu wanted to celebrate the Winter Solstice over at the wooden houses. At that time, he thought that the sun had risen from the west. That guy actually wanted to celebrate a holiday!?</p><br/><p>Originally, he had been planning on heading over right away. However, Bai Feiyun approached him to talk to him about some matters. Once he had finished everything and headed over, it had already gotten this late.</p><br/><p>The two had both disappeared. Baili Yu was prompted by a sudden impulse to celebrate some Winter Solstice over here, and now, Ye Chuan looked like he wanted to say something but was continuously hesitating. Due to this, Jun Xin couldn\u2019t help but associate all these things together.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan had known since long ago that Young Master Jun was incomparably intelligent. When he heard Jun Xin ask this, he immediately felt apprehensive. Based on Jun Xin\u2019s temper, if he found out that Master and Li Xueyi were really together, he\u2019d definitely rush right in.</p><br/><p>At that time, when Master\u2019s happy occasion was interrupted, the one who\u2019d suffer the punishment would definitely be him!</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan\u2019s brain raced. His lips tugged and formed a lie before he could even think it through. \u201cHe\u2019s with a lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin knitted his brows disbelievingly. \u201cA lady? From which family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing doubt flash through Jun Xin\u2019s eyes, Ye Chuan knew that as long as he stayed firm, he\u2019d be able to thoroughly fool Jun Xin. \u201cShe seems to be from the Imperial Violet Nation. As for the specifics, I\u2019m not too clear. At that time, Master got drunk and just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish his words, but the meaning was perfectly clear.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin muttered to himself for a while. \u201cAre you speaking the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan hastily nodded and said, \u201cThis subordinate doesn\u2019t dare to conceal things from Young Master Jun! It truly is like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t Tang Doudou inside and it was definitely an inconvenient time to see Baili Yu, Jun Xin decided to go back to Plum Garden and find Qing Yin to see if Tang Doudou had returned.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

During this entire time, Tang Doudou was mostly sleeping. She seemed to have regressed back to that earlier state and it seemed even worse than before too, so the worry on Baili Yu\u2019s face became even deeper.</p><br/><p>Even when they reached Azure Water Valley, he didn\u2019t wake Tang Doudou up and just carried her straight into the valley.</p><br/><p>Last time he came, those two doormen had stopped him, but this time, they respectfully invited him in saying that Senior Cang had been waiting for him.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu nodded, then walked into the Flying Eaves Pavilion that was built by the side of a cliff.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou woke up. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, then looked around and stretched. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh. Girl, you\u2019ve forgotten my place?\u201d Senior Cang\u2019s familiar voice appeared. Tang Doudou looked over with pleasant surprise and saw that Senior Cang was standing in the corridor and looking towards her with an affectionate smile.</p><br/><p>Then he looked towards Baili Yu and nodded towards him politely. \u201cBaili gongzi, please come this way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu nodded and followed after him while carrying Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Cang, this is where you went after you ran off from Cloud City?\u201d Tang Doudou noticed that Cang Baicao\u2019s way of walking was a little strange.</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao looked back and the strands of silver hair over his forehead bounced as he laughed. \u201cHaha, actually, no. I just happened to encounter Baili gongzi a few days ago, and then I came back to Azure Water Valley.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou found those strands of silver hair painful to see. Although Cang Baicao was over sixty, he had always been very spirited and his hair had been completely black without any strands of white. However, after just half a year, he seemed to have aged significantly, and as he walked, his back seemed much more stooped.</p><br/><p>What exactly had he been doing this past half a year?</p><br/><p>Seeming to sense her puzzled gaze, Cang Baicao glanced back again and stroked his beard, which was now also white, with a laugh. \u201cGirl, are you curious about what I\u2019ve been doing this past half a year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at Baili Yu. \u201cSenior Cang, when I was leaving Cloud City, Bai Feiyun said that you left without saying goodbye. At that time, he had given me a book and the book had recorded how to cure the Hoarfrost Poison. Did you leave to investigate that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, you should call me Old Cang after all. I\u2019m more used to that.\u201d Cang Baicao laughed merrily, but then, he stopped smiling and replied melancholically, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I left Cloud City to investigate the Hoarfrost Poison.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to get any results.\u201d When Senior Cang said this, his hair seemed to become even whiter.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was thinking that they had already gotten the way to cure the poison, so she switched to asking, \u201cThen what about the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance? Before, you had said that my Disseminating Tassel Fragrance had been neutralized on its own, but when I went to Cerulean Mountain, I heard from the person who poisoned me that Disseminating Tassel Fragrance and Hoarfrost Poison were both incurable. In addition, he said that the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance is still present in my body. Is this true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I made an error in my diagnosis. After I left, I realized it and sent a message to let you know, but you had already left Cloud City. I had no choice but to leave Feiyun with the news. Could it be that Feiyun didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou saw Senior Cang\u2019s expression, she asked, \u201cSenior Cang, could it be that you\u2019re not aware of what\u2019s happened on the Jianghu recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Cang\u2019s expression turned serious. \u201cWhat has happened now? After I left Cloud City, I paid visits to several old friends, but I hadn\u2019t heard about anything big happening? What exactly happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that he really didn\u2019t know, so Tang Doudou started filling him in on the recent events. After listening to all of it, Senior Cang remarked, \u201cNo wonder Baili gongzi\u2018s memories had been sealed when I encountered him. So much had actually happened. However, girl, you said that you saw the city lord in Cerulean Mountain, is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for him, there was no way that Yiling and I would\u2019ve been able to escape from Cerulean Mountain. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d mistake him. I just don\u2019t know what exactly he took from Cerulean Mountain. Lately, the Jianghu has been in an uproar, but Cloud City had been deathly still. It\u2019s not just Su Yi, the Murong family is abnormally silent as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, Bai Feiyun has been giving me a really strange feeling. He doesn\u2019t seem to be his usual self.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething has happened to Feiyun as well?\u201d Cang Baicao had been pushing open the door for them. His tone was filled with surprise when he heard this. \u201cGirl, once you get better, I\u2019ll head back to Huai City with you. I\u2019ve pretty much watched over Feiyun from the time he was a child. He\u2019s not bad at heart. If he\u2019s changed, that means something big has definitely happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao led the two into the room. He had Baili Yu settled Tang Doudou down, then he sat down next to the bed to check Tang Doudou\u2019s pulse. When he found out about Tang Doudou\u2019s pregnancy, he glanced in shock towards Baili Yu, then quickly hid his surprise. As he observed her pulse, he discovered something else that was off.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, why is there a new poison in your body? This poison is no less severe that the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance. What exactly is going on?\u201d He had to get a clear answer to this, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make an accurate diagnosis.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was stunned. She had been poisoned with something else? Why hadn\u2019t she sensed anything?</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao could tell from her expression that she hadn\u2019t been aware of this.</p><br/><p>Just as Cang Baicao was about to continue pressing her for answers, sounds of people fighting came from outside. Baili Yu indicated for Senior Cang to continue checking Tang Doudou\u2019s condition, then got up to head out.</p><br/><p>He soon came back again.</p><br/><p>However, his facial color seemed much worse. He looked at Tang Doudou with a serious expression, then glanced at Cang Baicao. He sat down next to Tang Doudou and gently stroked her forehead as he said, \u201cYou must be worn out from the journey, so rest for now. Someone outside is looking for Senior Cang, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be friendly, so I\u2019ll be accompanying Senior Cang out to see him. No matter what, stay in here, alright? I\u2019m worried that if we fight, you\u2019ll get injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that person was here to see Senior Cang.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. Although she had been sleeping on the carriage this entire time, sleeping on the carriage was nowhere as comfortable as sleeping on this bed.</p><br/><p>In any case, with Baili Yu here, she didn\u2019t need to worry about anything, so she should take this chance to catch up on sleep and recover. Once she got better, they had to head back to Huai City to deal with all the unresolved issues.</p><br/><p>After she closed her eyes, Baili Yu sent Senior Cang a pointed look. Senior Cang got the message and headed out, only to find that a person with a very cold aura was here. It was Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Cang Baicao was shocked to see Mu Ye. When he was undoing the memory seal on Baili Yu, he had realized that the seal was likely Mu Ye\u2019s handiwork. He couldn\u2019t figure out why Mu Ye had done that, and why he had come here this time.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s breathing gradually became even and steady, so Baili Yu tucked the tails of her blanket in and quietly headed out.</p><br/><p>His eyes, which had always contained traces of a smile was currently very cold, even colder than Mu Ye\u2019s eyes. He slowly said, \u201cSect Leader Mu, what exactly are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was the one that poisoned her.\u201d Mu Ye has always been straightforward. He glanced at the door that Baili Yu had just closed, then said, \u201cIf you want to know why, come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither Baili Yu or Cang Baicao moved. It was clear that they had no plans of leaving with him. After all, who knew if he was doing this to lure them out of their territory. In addition, Baili Yu had already swore not to let Tang Doudou\u2019s out of his sight again. Meanwhile, Cang Baicao couldn\u2019t understand Mu Ye\u2019s strange actions so he had no intention of leaving with him.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye lifted his brows as he looked at Baili Yu. \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t dare?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a vow that I would never let Doudou out of my sight again. Sect Leader Mu, if you have something to say, say it here. If you don\u2019t, then please see yourself out,\u201d replied Baili Yu mildly. He didn\u2019t seem surprised at all that Mu Ye had poisoned Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>This was because Nan Maner had already told him about this. If it weren\u2019t for that, he wouldn\u2019t have rushed with Tang Doudou here to find Cang Baicao.</p><br/><p>Nan Maner said that this poison was very unique and also very vicious. It would completely inhibit the unborn child\u2019s growth and delay the development of the fetus. However, it was also capable of protecting the child from the blood poisoned with Disseminating Tassel Fragrance.</p><br/><p>It was a poison that had very unique characteristics.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She glanced around the empty building, then noticed the closed front doors. \u201cYou guys closed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe owner said that we\u2019ll be closed for a few days,\u201d replied Jin Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where\u2019s your owner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yi lowered his head and said quietly, \u201cJin Yi doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t press him for answers. Gu Xun had probably headed out to prepare for their departure. However, the fact that he sent someone to keep a watch on them and prevent them from heading out probably meant that the situation was more severe than she had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, then help me call Lian er over.\u201d Tang Doudou waved her hand dismissively, then pulled Baili Yu back into the room.</p><br/><p>When she got back inside, she started rubbing her head again.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu grabbed her hand and squeezed it gently. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he pressed her down onto the chair before placing his fingertips on the sides of her head to slowly start massaging her. The gentle rhythmic pressure felt so good that Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but groan. \u201cWhen did you learn how to do this? You seem pretty professional.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu chuckled. \u201cProbably a very long time ago. I don\u2019t remember when. How is it? Comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn en, it feels really good!\u201d Tang Doudou closed her eyes to enjoy the sensation. \u201cBaili Yu, haven\u2019t you thought about trying to recover your memories?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s movements paused, then he answered in a slightly distressed tone, \u201cFor some reason, I like this current lifestyle, so I\u2019m not really that curious about the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the way you lived before was too tiring!\u201d</p><br/><p>As they spoke, she started feeling sleepy again, so she soon drifted off while enjoying this massage.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu carried her back onto the bed and sat quietly at the side to gaze at her. After a good while, he got up and went over to push open the window.</p><br/><p>Right after he opened the window, a figure nimbly jumped in.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019ve lost your memories!\u201d After that person came in, he strode over to the table and poured himself a cup of tea. After gulping it down, he exclaimed, \u201cThis little master\u2019s about to die from overwork! Is she already asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he walked towards the bed.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu walked over to block his way. \u201cLet her rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven after losing your memories, you still know how to look after your wife. Seems like she didn\u2019t rush without sleeping for three months in vain.\u201d</p><br/><p>This person that introduced himself as Jun Xin had come half a month ago to tell him about a bunch of strange things before rushing off again. Before he left, he had said that he would be back in half a month. Baili Yu hadn\u2019t expected him to be so prompt. Today was precisely half a month from that time.</p><br/><p>After Jun Xin rested a while, he looked Baili Yu over, then nodded. \u201cBaili Yu, actually, the way you are right now is pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t return after all. I\u2019ll help you guys find a quiet place and you guys can go live in seclusion.\u201d Jun Xin rubbed his chin. The more he thought about it, the more appealing this idea seemed. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced at him mildly. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez!\u201d Jun Xin stretched his waist as he remarked, \u201cThat excuse is so convenient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is your investigation going?\u201d Baili Yu sat down next to the bed and covered Tang Doudou again with the blanket that she had kicked away.</p><br/><p>When this matter was brought up, Jun Xin fumed again. \u201cSay, back then, you were seriously so nice to Yun Hai. It was like he was your biological son while the rest of us were all just foster children. You insisted on getting him everything he wanted, but in the end, he turned out to be a white-eyed wolf. We were even worried that he had been captured by the Seven Great Saint Tribes and were racking our brains for ideas to get him out! Yet right after we rescued him, he turned around and attacked you! If it weren\u2019t for the fact that there wasn\u2019t enough time, I would\u2019ve already headed back to kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Baili Yu had no memories of these people, his heart felt uncomfortable when he heard that Yun Hai really had betrayed him. \u201cDid you find out any other news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Jun Xin answered straightforwardly. \u201cYun Hai has gotten rid of all my subordinates. I only got these pieces of news by capturing a few of Yun Hai\u2019s people and forcing these information out of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d Baili Yu could see the exhaustion on Jun Xin\u2019s face, so he held back his other questions. \u201cGu Xun said that he wanted to send Tang Doudou and me out of here by tonight. You should go rest for now as well. I\u2019ll wake you up once we\u2019re about to leave.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThat works!\u201d Jun Xin was tired. Although he said that he was going to follow Tang Doudou from the shadows, half a month into their journey, his subordinates sent him astonishing news. So after that, he had to protect Tang Doudou from the shadows while rushing around to collect information.</p><br/><p>Then he rushed ahead to Hibiscus Garrison to find Baili Yu, then went back to deal with several pressing matters before rushing right back again. He had been stressed this entire time worrying about whether anything had happened to Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had traveled the road that Tang Doudou took three months to travel twice in that span of time. He was long past his limits. After Baili Yu said this, he headed directly towards the part of the room behind the screen. His eyelids were drooping even as he walked.</p><br/><p>Right after Jun Xin walked past the screen, Jin Yi knocked on the door and said, \u201cAlliance Head Li, Lian er is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin poked his head out. \u201cWho\u2019s Lian er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA courtesan that works here.\u201d Baili Yu got up and pushed open the door to walk out.</p><br/><p>A courtesan?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t strange for there to be courtesans here since this was a male brothel after all, but what was he looking for Tang Doudou for?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing. I\u2019ll ask her once she wakes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then we\u2019ll have to trouble you, Escort Xue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin thought things were resolved so he closed his eyes, but suddenly a shrill voice rang out. \u201cWhat is going on!? After she called me here, you\u2019re saying she\u2019s asleep!? Who knows if you aren\u2019t lying on purpose!? No way I\u2019m accepting this until I take a look for myself. Move, let me in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLian er, don\u2019t make a fuss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making a fuss, wasn\u2019t it Alliance Head Li that called for me? Would she call for me if it was nothing? From what I see, a certain person is just jealous and worried that I would snatch Alliance Head Li away, so he\u2019s lying and saying that Alliance Head Li is asleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLian er, Alliance Head Li is a very important guest of the owner. If you do this, the owner will kick you out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, Jin Yi, don\u2019t think that you\u2019re so special just because the owner assigned you to look after Alliance Head Li. Aren\u2019t you nothing but a courtesan as well!?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

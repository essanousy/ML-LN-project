What was astonishing was the fact that Murong Ming, whose martial arts had been nothing special, was now able to fight with apex expert Liu Zhiyuan on equal grounds.</p><br/><p>It had only been three months since they had last saw him, how did he become so strong?</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou watched Murong Ming, she really wanted to ask Su Yi about it.</p><br/><p>Su Yi lightly tapped his fingertips on the table. \u201cMurong Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Ming is Murong Yu\u2019s nephew. With Murong Yu\u2019s sword skills that are recognized as the number one in the world, it\u2019s not impossible for him to make Murong Ming\u2019s martial arts improve rapidly in a short period of time. However, the strange thing is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi had started analyzing the situation as if he was talking to himself before Tang Doudou even asked anything. \u201cHowever, Murong Ming isn\u2019t using a sword. It\u2019s actually Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s sword skills that seem very good. It seems like Murong Ming\u2019s change has nothing to do with Murong Yu ah! Then who could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou knew that he was doing this to help her analyze. Su Yi was trying to slowly familiarize her with these Jianghu affairs.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou thought about it, she felt that it was probably quite tiring for Su Yi. He had already taught all of this once in the past, and now he had to teach them again\u2026</p><br/><p>If it were her, she definitely would have just given up on it. Tang Doudou felt a little touched as she offered her opinion. \u201cI think, it\u2019s likely related to Nangong Yan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust give up ah you!\u201d Su Yi glanced at her as if he was looking at an idiot. \u201cHow could amnesia turn someone dumb? Where did your wits go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked towards the sky. Who\u2019s dumb you freaking yo-yo!? The person\u2019s already been swapped out, how could the same wits still be there? Just \u2018go die\u2019 ah you!</p><br/><p>Su Yi sighed as if he didn\u2019t know what to do with her. \u201cAlthough you did see Nangong Yan calm down after Murong Ming appeared, you can\u2019t link the two just like that! Nangong Yan has no interest in the Murong family. Even if she were to collude with someone, she would at the very least look for someone like Mu Ye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone like Mu Ye?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, someone who\u2019s the leader of a sect!\u201d Su Yi rubbed his cheek and glanced at the crowd again.</p><br/><p>It was still the same direction. Tang Doudou hastily looked over as well but still didn\u2019t see anyone of interest. She was also confused about what background Nangong Yan had. How come it felt like Su Yi feared her a lot?</p><br/><p>After all, his attitude towards Baili Yu was nowhere like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Ming\u2019s about to win!\u201d shouted Su Yi suddenly; however, his tone was not surprised.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou retrieved her trail of thought and hastily looked over, just in time to see Murong Ming flick aside Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s sword with his fan while his other hand, which was stretched into a claw, flew fiercely towards Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s throat.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye he had subdued Liu Zhiyuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really won?\u201d She hadn\u2019t been mentally prepared like Su Yi had been and was shocked to see Murong Ming win. She had, after all, experienced Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s sword skills personally before. \u201cCould it be that Liu Zhiyuan is faking it?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, right after she said this, she shook her head. There were martial arts experts all around. How high would Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s acting ability have to be in order to fool so many eyes?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve let me win!\u201d (polite phrase to say) Murong Ming couldn\u2019t stop the corners of his lips from lifting. Anyone could see how delighted he was.</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan only listened to Nangong Yan\u2019s orders. He only went on stage in order to cause trouble for Tang Doudou. Now that he lost, he simply walked off the stage without a word.</p><br/><p>What Murong Ming said earlier was only out of politeness. When he saw Liu Zhiyuan walk down, he turned towards Su Yi and Tang Doudou and said, \u201cThis junior of the younger generation, Murong Ming, greets City Lord Su.\u201d</p><br/><p>Out of all the people that came onstage, he was the only one to announce his own name.</p><br/><p>Su Yi couldn\u2019t not reply to him. Moreover, he had felt pretty satisfied from beating him up last time so he had no reason to give the person more attitude. After laughing politely, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s the Murong family? Junior is promising, not bad, not bad ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone sounded as if it was his first time seeing Murong Ming; it even contained a bit of the appreciation those of the older generation had towards the younger generation.</p><br/><p>A trace of hatred flashed through Murong Ming\u2019s eyes and he lowered his gaze in order to conceal it. \u201cMany thanks for City Lord\u2019s praise. This junior does not deserve such honor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be so polite, young people should be a little more flamboyant!\u201d Su Yi laughed heartily, then glanced at the crowd below. \u201cIf no one wants to come up to challenge this Murong gongzi of ours, then let\u2019s just end today\u2019s competition now!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, Tang Doudou saw happiness appear in Murong Ming\u2019s eyes and couldn\u2019t help but become bewildered. What exactly did he mean by this?</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s words were obviously meant to incite someone to come up. The fact that he had chosen to say this now meant he was confident that someone would respond, and someone did. Right after he finished speaking, someone came onstage.</p><br/><p>The person wore a silver mask and had hair that was ink-black with a few strands of sparkling silver hair. The moment this person landed on the stage, an incomparable chill swept outwards.</p><br/><p>Huh!?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou abruptly stood up and cried out in shock, \u201cMing Mengxin!\u201d</p><br/><p>That person turned around and his lips seemed to curve into a smile. His sharp eyes contained deep emotions that she couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>It really was Ming Mengxin!</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t seen him since that time in Mist City and didn\u2019t hear any news about him. How did he suddenly reappear again? And he was even participating in her matchmaking event? Could it be that old man\u2019s doing again?</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Mengxin?\u201d asked Su Yi in confusion. \u201cWho is he? And this aura is so strange, why haven\u2019t I ever heard of him before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s said to be the Hall Master of God Firmament Hall.\u201d Regardless of what his goal was, he definitely wouldn\u2019t dare to mess around in Cloud City so she should just watch for now. Calmer now, Tang Doudou slowly sat back down.</p><br/><p>Su Yi was still puzzled. \u201cGod Firmament Hall? What is that? Why haven\u2019t I ever heard of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSire is participating in the matchmaking competition, yet refuses to show his true appearance. Sire truly doesn\u2019t care about giving City Lord Su face at all!\u201d When Murong Ming saw that Tang Doudou was shocked by Ming Mengxin\u2019s appearance to the point that she involuntarily stood up and called out his name, he became very unhappy and spoke with a strangely gloomy tone.</p><br/><p>Ming Mengxin simply smiled. The chilling aura he gave off became even more intense as he asked coldly, \u201cWill you fight, or flee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Allow me to teach you, this arrogant bastard, a proper lesson!\u201d Murong Ming gave a humph and opened his fan with a swish as he elegantly attacked Ming Mengxin.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had never seen Ming Mengxin fight before and didn\u2019t know how good his martial arts were, so she immediately opened her eyes wide in order to get a good look at exactly how strong Ming Mengxin was. After all, the old man had spoken of him so highly.</p><br/><p>Su Yi was also very curious about how capable this Ming Mengxin was, to actually make his obedient disciple lose self-control.</p><br/><p>Murong Ming\u2019s movements looked elegant, but each move was fierce and deadly. There was no trace of the Murong family\u2019s martial arts left. When Murong Yu saw, his facial color changed and his eyes darkened. It was unknown what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>Although Murong Ming\u2019s attacks were fierce, Ming Mengxin didn\u2019t seem to mind at all. He slightly tilted his head and moved back lightly just enough to dodge the attack.</p><br/><p>Some dodged because they weren\u2019t strong enough to fight headon. Others dodged because they felt it beneath themselves to fight with you.</p><br/><p>Ming Mengxin was clearly one of the latter. However, with the current situation, how could he not fight?</p><br/><p>Originally, he had wanted to teach that Liu Zhiyuan a lesson, but his plan was ruined by Murong Ming so he could only vent his anger out on Murong Ming.</p><br/><p>Suddenly \u2013 no one had been able to see what exactly Ming Mengxin did \u2013 Murong Ming was sent flying. His fan fell off the stage, startling everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of martial arts was that?\u201d Su Yi knitted his brows. His confused tone also contained some musings; for some reason he felt that the scene seemed familiar.</p><br/><p>Although Ming Mengxin knocked down Murong Ming, he didn\u2019t stop. His figure moved like a shadow, with just a slight movement he got to Murong Ming.</p><br/><p>Murong Ming was currently completely confused as to what was going on. Earlier, he only felt a chilling aura attack him. Before he could even get a clear look, he was already falling. His entire body even felt limp and he couldn\u2019t stir his inner strength at all.</p><br/><p>He looked back in that direction. When he saw that Ming Mengxin was coming over, he cried out, \u201cDespicable! To actually use poison!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t his current situation just as if he had been poisoned?</p><br/><p>Ming Mengxin towered over him as he looked down. Then, with a cruel smile, he stomped down.</p><br/><p>Krr-ack\u2026</p><br/><p>The teeth-aching sound of bones shattering transmitted outwards. Tang Doudou immediately covered her chin. F*ck, he sure was ruthless!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

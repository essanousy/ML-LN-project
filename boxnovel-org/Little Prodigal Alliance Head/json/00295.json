I already said that Cerulean Mountain isn\u2019t a place where you guys can come and go as you please!\u201d Lan Jia, who had been observing them silently for a while, suddenly sneered, \u201cSu Yi, I won\u2019t be able to stop you from leaving, but I won\u2019t allow you to take those two with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, he attacked Su Yi with his sword. Su Yi didn\u2019t want to waste time battling with him and just retreated with Tang Doudou and Baili Yiling in tow.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia said coldly, \u201cShen Moru, you\u2019re still not making a move? How long do you plan to wait?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Moru still didn\u2019t move. He attacked, but it was to kill off the person dressed in red. He turned to look at Lan Jia with his dark eyes and said slowly, \u201cAs of now, our abilities are on the same level. If you want me to help you, at the very least, shouldn\u2019t you say please?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia\u2019s lips twitched. Had Shen Moru gone crazy to be acting like that in this situation? If Tang Doudou escaped, they would have no other source of Xuanyuan blood. They had each eaten a half of that immortality pill, but all that the pill would do was increase their martial arts. They needed Xuanyuan blood in order to cultivate. Had Shen Moru gone dumb and forgotten about their purpose?</p><br/><p>Or was it that he had a different plan from the start?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll have to ask Brother Shen to form an alliance with me and quickly take down these three. Afterwards, we can settle on a suitable time to discuss these matters at length, how is that?\u201d As Su Yi had said, he had no way of preventing all three of them from leaving by himself.</p><br/><p>Only then did Shen Moru nod in satisfaction. \u201cThat\u2019s precisely what I wanted as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, he flew forward to attack Su Yi alongside Lan Jia. Su Yi, who had been unruffled earlier, was starting to struggle with two experts attacking him. He had to focus all his efforts on dealing with the two and didn\u2019t have the time to protect Tang Doudou and Baili Yiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, get back. Once you see a chance, take it and run, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling hastily nodded and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Senior Su, I\u2019ll definitely get Sister-in-Law out of here safely!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, good girl!\u201d Su Yi smiled in satisfaction, then waved his hand. The sky seemed to fill with stars that merged into a bright ray which shot towards Lan Jia and Shen Moru. Su Yi forced them to retreat a distance back, then stopped attacking to send Tang Doudou and Baili Yiling away. \u201cHurry and leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, how could Lan Jia possibly allow that? \u201cBrother Shen, I\u2019ll delay Su Yi, so please go catch those two.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Shen Moru agreed without any complaints and rushed straight towards Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law, we need to run!\u201d When Baili Yiling saw that Shen Moru was chasing after them, she hastily urged Tang Doudou to start running.</p><br/><p>The two weren\u2019t very good at martial arts, but they were extremely good at qinggong.</p><br/><p>The moment they decided to run, they put all of their strength into their qinggong.</p><br/><p>When Shen Moru found that he couldn\u2019t catch up with them, he was so angry his chest hurt from the boiling fury. If he hadn\u2019t eaten that immortality pill, he could\u2019ve moved using the black fog. However, ever since he had taken that pill, he hadn\u2019t been able to use that technique. That technique wasn\u2019t the only one that he could no longer use, a lot of his other techniques seemed to have been sealed somehow as well. That was why he had provoked Lan Jia earlier out of anger.</p><br/><p>As of now, his inner strength had increased so much it felt like he had an unending amount of it. However, he was no longer able to use a lot of martial arts techniques now, so this inner strength was useless. He felt very vexed. For some reason, ever since he had taken that pill, a strange energy had appeared inside his dantian.</p><br/><p>What exactly was that?</p><br/><p>Could it be that the rumor of the immorality pill being fake was actually true?</p><br/><p>During that moment in which he had spaced out, Tang Doudou and Baili Yiling had already disappeared from sight. When Lan Jia saw, he exploded with anger. \u201cShen Moru, they\u2019re already gone! What are you still daydreaming for!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Darkness flashed through Shen Moru\u2019s eyes as he said coldly, \u201cSo? Even if they run, they won\u2019t be able to escape. Rather than wasting time chasing after those two, we should work together to deal with Su Yi first. Once Su Yi is taken out, who else in this world would still be able to protect them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia was still annoyed, but he had to admit that Shen Moru\u2019s suggestion was very smart. As long as they killed these people, no one else would ever get in their way again!</p><br/><p>Su Yi laughed with contempt. \u201cYou two want to kill me? Keep dreaming. Since those girls are no longer there, I\u2019ll say this now. Lan Jia, Shen Moru\u2026 I\u2019d advise you two to take advantage of this time to hurry and get that poison out of your bodies instead of wasting time trying to fight with me. Humph, do you two really believe that thing\u2019s an immortality pill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia and Shen Moru refuted at the same time, \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Moru said, \u201cSu Yi, quit trying to confuse us with crafty words. Back then, you had killed plenty of people for the immortality pill as well. You\u2019ve also done your share of atrocious acts, but now you\u2019re telling us that this immortality pill is fake? Aren\u2019t you slapping your own face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia\u2019s eyes darkened. He didn\u2019t get involved in this conversation because he was younger than them by a generation and had no idea what happened between Su Yi and Shen Moru, much less what Su Yi was like back then.</p><br/><p>When the past was brought up, the smile on Su Yi\u2019s face immediately turned cold. \u201cSince you don\u2019t believe me, then just forget it. In any case, the ones to be dying with their eyes still open won\u2019t be me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although his tone was cold, he made no indication of attacking. Lan Jia and Shen Moru shared a glance, then attacked simultaneously.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t allow Su Yi to walk away alive. The consequences would be too dire.</p><br/><p>Su Yi lifted his brows with disdain. Since he didn\u2019t have to worry about the two girls, he could now use his full strength against these two. Although he couldn\u2019t kill them, he could still delay them long enough for the girls to flee.</p><br/><p>As for him! If he wanted to flee, no one had the ability to stop him!</p><br/><p>Shen Moru and Lan Jia naturally knew what he was planning, so they attacked him without reserve in an attempt to kill him as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>As an intense battle started up again, Tang Doudou and Baili Yiling continued running like their lives depended on it. In just a little while, they had arrived at the beach again.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling continued running as she searched for a safe direction to run in, but after running awhile, when she looked back, she saw that Tang Doudou was still standing at the beach and staring at the ocean in a daze.</p><br/><p>She sighed and ran back. \u201cSister-in-Law, you\u2019re hung up on it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYiling, say, if Baili Yu really had fallen into the sea\u2026 could he have been washed ashore somewhere by the waves?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

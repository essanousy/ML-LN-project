However, before they entered the city, Mu Ye had put a human skin mask on her and applied makeup to her eyes. With the black robe concealing pretty much all of her features and the appearance of a hunchback added on, Tang Doudou was pretty sure that even Baili Yu wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize her if she didn\u2019t make a sound, so she wasn\u2019t worried that Murong Ming would recognize her.</p><br/><p>Murong Ming only examined her a little before he gave a smile which he believed to be very gentle. \u201cThis friend, I heard from the shopkeeper earlier that you and your friend opened two high class rooms, but one is still empty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe went out, but he\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that.\u201d Murong Ming smiled slightly but didn\u2019t move to leave. Tang Doudou naturally knew what he wanted. What else could it be except that he wanted her to give up one of the high class rooms? However, why should she?</p><br/><p>Even if he wasn\u2019t Murong Ming and was just some random stranger, there was no way she\u2019d agree.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I need to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Ming\u2019s facial color changed slightly. He had heard her ask the waiter about them, so she already knew about their situation. Anyone with brains could tell what he came for, yet she was still pretending not to know. It was seriously hateful.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn reality, friend, I came because I wanted to negotiate a matter with you.\u201d Actually, Murong Ming also knew that this was an awkward situation, but Nangong Yan, that psycho, kept throwing tantrums just because they only had two high class rooms. She practically wanted to kill everyone she could get her hands on. The ruckus was driving him crazy. If it weren\u2019t for his uncle\u2019s command, he would have already pushed this crazy woman into the sea. He already had enough of her on the way here.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rejected him without even bothering to consider it. \u201cPlease leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, she slammed the door closed and slided the door bolt over.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she was worried about exposing her identity and attracting even more trouble, she definitely would have taught Murong Ming a lesson.</p><br/><p>Her door had closed very loudly. Not only did it give Murong Ming a shock, it attracted the attention of Nangong Yan who was still going crazy by herself. When she saw that Murong Ming was standing by that door, her expression became even more displeased. She kicked aside the servant kneeling on the ground and walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you? Didn\u2019t you say that you\u2019d be able to get a high class room right away? Why haven\u2019t you gotten it yet!?\u201d The moment Nangong Yan walked up, she started interrogating him in an overbearing manner. Even Murong Ming couldn\u2019t stand the embarrassment anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re outside, so it\u2019d be best if Miss Nangong restrains herself a little!\u201d Murong Ming gave a cold humph. The only reason he had been ingratiating himself to this woman on the road here was because he was worried about her dog, Liu Zhiyuan.</p><br/><p>However, Liu Zhiyuan had gotten angry and run off because of this woman\u2019s slap!</p><br/><p>Thus, he didn\u2019t restrain his words anymore. This outcome naturally angered Nangong Yan to the point she almost puked blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you actually dare to speak to me this way!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Nangong shouldn\u2019t forget, you were the one that asked this favor of our Murong family. If you don\u2019t wish for the plan to fail, then you should behave and stop causing so much trouble. Should your identity be exposed, you\u2019d be the one in trouble!\u201d Although Murong Ming had lowered his voice, Tang Doudou who was hiding next to the door heard everything clearly.</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, their motives in coming this time truly wasn\u2019t simple. However, she was curious. Not even a hundred Murong families could compare to the power of Wind Cloud Island, so why would Nangong Yan end up having to ask the Murong family for help?</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Ming, you actually dare to threaten me!?\u201d No matter how crazy Nangong Yan was, she still had brains. She knew that she would be the one in the most danger if her identity was revealed, but she was so angry earlier that she forgot. Now that Murong Ming reminded her, she also hastily lowered her voice. Still, her suppressed anger didn\u2019t diminish at all.</p><br/><p>Murong Ming gave a cold laugh. \u201cI naturally wouldn\u2019t dare to threaten Miss Nangong. I was just giving a reminder.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he moved to leave. However, when he was passing by Nangong Yan, he said in a low voice, \u201cI feel that right now, the most important thing Miss Nangong should do is find that servant. Otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Yan naturally understood the importance of Liu Zhiyuan. If it weren\u2019t for Liu Zhiyuan, she wouldn\u2019t have dared to be so fearless as to come to Cerulean Mountain either.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Nangong Yan turned her head away and paid no more attention to Murong Ming. She slowly went downstairs and left the inn. From the looks of it, she was off to find Liu Zhiyuan.</p><br/><p>Murong Ming watched until she was far away before laughing coldly again. \u201cWhore! And she really thinks herself to be some precious goods? I\u2019d like to see how you could still be so arrogant when you\u2019re begging for mercy on my bed!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the scenario of dog biting dog and each taking a chunk of fur off!</p><br/><p>After listening to the drama, Tang Doudou stood up and yawned. She was just about to head to bed when she heard Murong Ming say, \u201cAnd that shameless despicable Li Xueyi! How dare she allow Jun Xin, that rabid dog, to injure me so severely! I\u2019ll make her pay for that sooner or later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Da fudge? She got shot even though she was lying that far away?</p><br/><p>She really had to admit respect for these people\u2019s ability to pick trouble out of nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Gray, help me keep an eye out. I\u2019m going to rest for a while.\u201d If she hadn\u2019t used qinggong, she definitely wouldn\u2019t be this tired. She should rest properly in order to help the injury heal and avoid further complications.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray screeched softly in response, then obediently crouched down by the head of the bed and watched the surroundings vigilantly.</p><br/><p>His responsible and loyal little manner made Tang Doudou smile. She lay down on the bed and was soon asleep.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray glanced at Tang Doudou who was sound asleep, then jumped off the bed. He went to the place where Mu Ye had left a cloth bundle and dug inside for a small bottle.</p><br/><p>After that, he jumped onto the table and poured the thing inside the bottle into the kettle before putting away the bottle and jumping back onto the bed.</p><br/><p>He continued to watch Tang Doudou for a while before smiling in a very human way. This female master was pretty nice. She was cute and gentle, and also treated him very well. It was just that she didn\u2019t seem to like Master much.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye only returned to the inn when it was very late in the night.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray was excited and about to rush up to his master when he saw his master make a shush motion towards him.</p><br/><p>Only then did he recall that there was someone on the bed, so he jumped off to give his position to Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye walked over and half-crouched by the bed. The coldness in his eyes melted into gentle water. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten, but that\u2019s also good.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019ve only met him once, but he seems very familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no need to mind him. As long as he doesn\u2019t harm you, it\u2019s fine. As for Nangong Yan, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t compete with her too much so that she doesn\u2019t get the idea of trying to injure you again. She\u2019s the biological granddaughter of the Wind Cloud Island Master, so even Baili Yu doesn\u2019t dare to do anything to her. If you want to get revenge, it\u2019s best if you borrow someone else\u2019s hand to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! For a nobleman\u2019s revenge, ten years is not too late! I\u2019ll make her pay sooner or later!\u201d Tang Doudou rubbed her nose. \u201cLet\u2019s head back first. Su Yi, that old brat is definitely furious that I ran off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin lowered his eyes slightly and swallowed back his words again. As he watched her lively figure leave, he suddenly called out, \u201cTang Doudou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Jun Xin\u2019s abrupt call of \u2018Tang Doudou\u2019 made her momentarily confused. After all, she had gotten used to being called \u2018Li Xueyi\u2019 so being called \u2018Tang Doudou\u2019 was disorientating. She turned around and asked, \u201cAre you calling me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else do you want to say?\u201d In reality, she still had questions to ask as well. Now that Jun Xin had called her to a stop, she had to take advantage of this chance. Who could guarantee that he wouldn\u2019t change his mind later?</p><br/><p>Jun Xin nodded. \u201cMing Mengxin is my original name. After I was brought to Wind Cloud Island by Master, my name was changed to Jun Xin.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw Tang Doudou open her mouth, he said with a smile, \u201cSince you\u2019re already used to calling me Jun Xin, there\u2019s no need to change your way of address.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, that\u2019s was exactly what I was thinking\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI lived on Wind Cloud Island for about eleven years, then left to see the world and gain experience. The reputation of Blood Fiend Jun Xin started to spread during that time. During those years, I went to a lot of places and saw a lot of things. Then, I finally found information on who I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he slowly recounted these events, a bit of turbulence appeared in his clear almond eyes. \u201cI also found out about many hidden secrets, and joined God Firmament Hall and became a Saint Envoy of the Saint Tribes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seven Great Saint Tribes\u2019 Saint Envoy?\u201d These words caused Tang Doudou great shock. Her eyes widened in disbelief. \u201cBut you, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a descendant of the Seven Great Saint Tribes. After becoming a Saint Envoy, I found out from researching in their book repository that I am from the Wind Tribe. However, I didn\u2019t tell anyone about it. In the Saint Tribes, Saint Envoys had much more power than the descendants, and also had much more freedom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany years passed again. While I was investigating the Seven Great Saint Tribes\u2019 secrets, I discovered an even more important secret and at the same time also became the alleged Hall Master of the God Firmament Hall.\u201d (Basically, in public they call him that, but it\u2019s not necessarily true.)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that God Firmament Hall still has some other Hall Master? What secrets were you investigating? You know my grandpa, could it be that he\u2019s also someone of the Saint Tribes? Am I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overthink things. I only got to know your grandpa through the Master of Wind Cloud Island. It has nothing to do with the Saint Tribes. Other than the fact that you\u2019ve been poisoned with Disseminating Tassel Fragrance and hence will be raised to become a blood source, you have no connection at all to the Seven Great Saint Tribes.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou saw that his gaze flickered as he said this. It was clear that he was still keeping something from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that you\u2019re just saying this in order to console me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had finished saying most of the important things that he wanted to say, so he returned to his usual casual manner. Curling his lips disdainfully, he said, \u201cWho would have the time to bother to try and console you? I\u2019m simply putting out the facts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, there\u2019s still one more important matter that I have to tell you about. Su Yi\u2019s motives when he agreed to shelter you back then weren\u2019t simple, so it\u2019s best if you stay on guard around him. He acts carefree and casual, but you shouldn\u2019t be fooled. When he was young, the entire world called had called Cloud City the Devil\u2019s City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil\u2019s City?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause a devil lived in it, obviously! You really are dumb!\u201d Jun Xin rapped her head. \u201cAiy, now that I think about it, I\u2019m the only one with pure motives, everyone else all harbor secret motives. If you hadn\u2019t lost your memories, there\u2019d probably be a lot of people that want to kill you. It\u2019s just a pity that now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is that people wanting to kill me is a good thing?\u201d Although she spoke about it lightly, she knew that everything Jun Xin said was true. If it wasn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t have transmigrated into this world and the real Li Xueyi wouldn\u2019t have gone to report to the underworld at such a young age.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

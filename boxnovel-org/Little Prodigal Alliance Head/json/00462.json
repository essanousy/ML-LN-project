You're!\"</p><br/><p>\"See, see? And you still dared to say that you didn't know him?\" Grandpa He slapped He Xiaoqin's arm, then laughed loudly, \"Haha, Xiao Tang, don't take offense! This kid's just joking!\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Tang laughed along. \"Haha, it's fine. There's no way I'd bicker with a kid.\"</p><br/><p>\"You're the kid! What is with you? Why did you follow me here?\" He Xiaoqin peeled off Grandpa He's hand and plopped himself down on a chair next to Xiao Tang. \"I'm telling you, that money was given with mutual consent. Give up on trying to take it back!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry. What belongs to you belongs to you.\" Xiao Tang sat down as well, then looked towards Grandpa He. \"Grandpa He, you should sit too.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright!\" Grandpa He thought that the misunderstanding was cleared so he didn't worry about it anymore and sat down.</p><br/><p>Xiao Tang then looked towards the guards and said, \"Go get some food. We'll be having lunch here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood!\"</p><br/><p>After the guards left, He Xiaoqin toyed with the cup as he asked, \"You really want me to follow you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, this is your choice. You can decide whether you're willing or not.\" Xiao Tang flipped open his fan confidently.</p><br/><p>He Xiaoqin peeked towards Grandpa He who was looking at them curiously, then coughed. \"Give me some time to consider it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Three days?\"</p><br/><p>\"Just three days!?\"</p><br/><p>Grandpa He was baffled by their exchange and said, \"Xiao Tang ah! Don't be too easy on Xiaoqin. Just take him with you now.\"</p><br/><p>\"No way! Grandpa!\" He Xiaoqin immediately refused, but he was also worried that Grandpa He would get angry again and added, \"Grandpa, your illness hadn't flared up for a long time but it suddenly flared up again now. I have to find a doctor to take a look at you. I can only go with him without worries once I'm sure that you're fine!\"</p><br/><p>His words were logical, so Grandpa He hesitated for a little while before nodding and looking towards Xiao Tang.</p><br/><p>\"It just so happens that there are several famous doctors where I'm staying. I'll have them come here to take a look at you, Grandpa.\"</p><br/><p>\"How, how could we accept this?\"</p><br/><p>\"From now on, we're family, so there's no need to be polite, Grandpa.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiaoqin shouted, \"Who the hell's family with you?\"</p><br/><p>Grandpa He berated, \"Xiaoqin!\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Tang said, \"It's fine, it's fine. How about this? Grandpa, you should go rest first. I'll chat with Xiaoqin outside.\"</p><br/><p>\"That works. You young people should talk amongst yourselves. This old body of mine really can't hold up. I'm going to go sleep first.\" Grandpa He turned around to head back to his room to rest.</p><br/><p>The moment he left, He Xiaoqin lifted one leg and stomped on the table as he whispered fiercely, \"Old lady, what exactly are you trying to do!?\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Tang, aka Tang Doudou, hit his leg with the fan. \"Manners, manners!\"</p><br/><p>\"Eff the damned manners! If you don't talk, I won't be polite anymore! Don't think that just because you're a woman and pregnant that I don't dare to hit you. I'm telling you! I'm telling you\u2026\" He Xiaoqin waved his fist at Tang Doudou as he threatened her, but the more he spoke, the more his voice faded in confidence. Forget hitting a pregnant woman, he couldn't even bring himself to hit a woman!</p><br/><p>The moment Grandpa He left, Tang Doudou returned to her usual personality. Her eyes whirled, then she reached out and squeezed He Xiaoqin's fist. The moment she sent some inner strength into her palm, He Xiaoqin started screaming like he was a pig being slaughtered. \"Ahh!!! It hurts, owwwww! L-let go, let go already!\"</p><br/><p>\"If you behave, I'll let go, but if you don't\u2026\" Tang Doudou squeezed a little harder and He Xiaoqin immediately started screaming in pain again. Grandpa He asked if things were alright and Tang Doudou hastily covered He Xiaoqin's mouth and whispered, \"Talk properly, otherwise I'll tell your grandpa about how you stole money.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiaoqin glared at her. Fine!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou let go of him and dusted off her clothes as she shot He Xiaoqin a look.</p><br/><p>\"Ahem, it's nothing Grandpa. Xiao, Xiao Tang gongzi's helping me, he's helping me check my bones!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, he's checking your bones?\" mumbled Grandpa He, then there was no more sound. It seemed like he had been very drowsy.</p><br/><p>He Xiaoqin rubbed his painful hand as he glowered at Tang Doudou. After considering things for a while, he said, \"You've already asked about the things that you wanted to know. Since Grandpa was happy today, I won't charge you a fee, but please stop tormenting me already, alright? You can see how poor I am. You have money and influence, so why exactly are you here?\"</p><br/><p>Why was she here?</p><br/><p>Of course it was because of his parents. Based on what Grandpa He had said, he had found He Xiaoqin at this old temple. However, if He Xiaoqin had been found here, how did Grandpa He know who his parents were?</p><br/><p>And he even knew that his parents were wealthy and influential.</p><br/><p>Could it be that Grandpa He was lying to her?</p><br/><p>No. She could tell from his eyes that everything he said had been true.</p><br/><p>Then there was only one possibility, which was that He Xiaoqin's parents had come to find He Xiaoqin before when Grandpa He found him.</p><br/><p>She had suspected He Xiaoqin of being Lan Jia's child, but Lan Jia would always kill the woman after she gave birth to the child. She couldn't help but wonder again if her guesses had been off when she found out about the existence of these parents.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, what are you scheming now?\" When Tang Doudou didn't speak, He Xiaoqin stared at her warily in fear that she was trying to come up with another way to torment him.</p><br/><p>Fudge, did she look that evil?</p><br/><p>For better or for worse, she had helped this guy twice!</p><br/><p>When she first came to this temple, it was with the plan to gain Grandpa He's trust. However, she had arrived just in time to see Grandpa He's illness flaring up and saved him. Hence, she adjusted her plan and slightly twisted the truth a little to get Grandpa He to trust her.</p><br/><p>She had also helped He Xiaoqin get rid of that banker earlier\u2026 How could this brat have so little conscience?</p><br/><p>\"Brat, as long as you agree to one thing, I promise not to bother you again. How's that?\" Tang Doudou saw that there was no point trying to skirt around the bush with He Xiaoqin, so she decided to just state her motive.</p><br/><p>He Xiaoqin was already fed up with her and waved impatiently. \"Just say it already.\"</p><br/><p>\"I want to investigate your parents, but I don't know where to start so I want to ask for your help.\" Tang Doudou rubbed her chin as she observed He Xiaoqin's reaction.</p><br/><p>However, to her surprise, his reaction was very unusual. HIs eyes flickered with some unreadable light before he quickly concealed it. If it weren't for the fact that she had been observing closely, she would've missed it.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, He Xiaoqin was still young and wasn't the best at concealing his emotions. If it had been Baili Yu, she wouldn't have been able to catch anything.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, He Xiaoqin said with a smile, \"Alright! I want to investigate those two anyways! You don't know where to start and I do, but it's just a pity I never had the chance. This collaboration is perfect! We can investigate who exactly those heartless people are!\"</p><br/><p>He was a young man that was only about twelve, but Tang Doudou sensed a gloomy chill from his light words.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this kid really hated his parents a lot!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced down, then raised her cup towards He Xiaoqin. He Xiaoqin copied her manner and lifted his cup as well.</p><br/><p>The cups clinked. Tang Doudou narrowed her eyes with a smile. \"Pleasure to be working with you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Pleasure to be working with you.\" He Xiaoqin repeated her strange words.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou got back from the old temple, it was already night.</p><br/><p>She pulled off the human skin mask and rubbed her sore waist and thighs. She was just about to head back to her room to rest when she saw Qing Yu run over. \"Madame, Madame! You're finally back!\"</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou got closer and saw how flustered Qing Yu was, she asked, \"Did something happen?\"</p><br/><p>\"Madame, Master is looking for you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Baili Yu's back?\" Tang Doudou's eyes flickered and she pulled Qing Yu to a stop. \"Where is he?\"</p><br/><p>Qing Yu replied, \"He's at the pavilion. He's been waiting for Madame for a long time.\"</p><br/><p>Why was he waiting for her?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was confused, but she had Qing Yu withdraw first before slowly walking towards the pavilion.</p><br/><p>\"Baili Yu? Big evil spirit?\" When Tang Doudou reached the pavilion, she found that Baili Yu was sleeping.</p><br/><p>She called him several times but couldn't wake him up. Since the night wind was a little chilly, she went to the room to get him a blanket.</p><br/><p>After doing this, she sat down next to Baili Yu and gazed at his extraordinarily handsome face. She sighed softly, \"Big evil spirit, you're so beautiful.</p><br/><p>\"In all honesty, how can a person be so beautiful? Tell me the truth, are you really human?</p><br/><p>\"You probably aren't human. You're probably a spirit! Look at how alluring your looks are after all! Back then I was really scared of you, but now, hehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Now that I think about it, you're the first person I've ever loved in this lifetime. To be able to stay with the person you love until old age is such a difficult matter.\"</p><br/><p>Something seemed to occur to Tang Doudou and she moved closer to Baili Yu to pat his face again. \"Baili Yu? Husband?</p><br/><p>\"He really is asleep.\"</p><br/><p>After making sure that Baili Yu was asleep, she glanced around again. After making sure that there was no one around, she lowered her voice to say, \"Baili Yu, I want to tell you a secret.</p><br/><p>\"But before I tell you this secret, I need to ask you a question.</p><br/><p>\"If you mind it, just tell me. If you don't mind, then you don't need to say anything. Just give silent affirmation.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, since you're not saying anything, you must not mind it!\"</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at Baili Yu and hesitated for a very long time before she slowly said, \"If I wasn't Li Xueyi, would you mind?\"</p><br/><p>There was no reaction from Baili Yu, so she laughed. \"Haha, I knew it! You don't mind!\"</p><br/><p>\"I just knew that you wouldn't mind\u2026\" Her laughter faded and worry appeared in her eyes. She seemed to be muttering to herself as she said, \"In reality, what does it matter if you mind? Why can't Xiao Bai just understand? And Su Yi, isn't he pretty smart? Why would he also think that I'm not Li Xueyi? Could it be that we're really that different?</p><br/><p>\"What part of me isn't as good as Li Xueyi?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

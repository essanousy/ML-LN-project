Following that, she seemed to find something ironic and showed contempt\u2026 Bai Feiyun had taken in all of her expressions. He set down the book he was too distracted to read, then got up and walked to her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was still lost in thought when she suddenly felt the coolness of shade. She was hit with the scent of magnolia and immediately snapped out of her thoughts. When she looked up, she saw that Bai Feiyun was already very close to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cX-xiao Bai. You, what are you doing?\u201d The moment she lifted her head, Bai Feiyun reached out and lifted her chin higher so that he could take in her face fully. Tang Doudou was flustered by his out of character action and instinctively called him the way she used to back then.</p><br/><p>The current Bai Feiyun felt dangerous. His expression seemed as gentle as usual, but his usually calm eyes were now sharp as blades as he emotionlessly scrutinized Tang Doudou\u2019s face as if he wanted to see through her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou tried to push him, but the moment she reached out, her hands were pinned firmly behind her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Feiyun, you\u2026 Ah!\u201d Just as she was trying to calm down and ask him what exactly he was planning to do, Bai Feiyun abruptly pushed her down on the stone table. The back of her head hit the table hard and she was struck with a bout of dizziness.</p><br/><p>When her vision finally cleared up, she saw that Bai Feiyun\u2019s perfect face was only half a finger\u2019s distance away from her own. His breath seemed to contain the scent of magnolia as it hit her face. There was a faintly sad and ambiguous feeling about all of this. Tang Doudou was very uncomfortable and she had no idea what exactly Bai Feiyun was trying to do.</p><br/><p>Little Gray also fell from her shoulders, but he landed nimbly on the ground. When he turned around, he found that that the female master had been pressed onto the stone table. That seemingly gentle and harmless man was leaning over the female master while emitting a dangerous aura.</p><br/><p>Little Gray recalled what Master told him before leaving and started screeching as he charged towards Bai Feiyun to save his female master from this bad guy.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun recognized this monkey as the legendary nine-eared monkey. He had seen this monkey with Mu Ye before, so he soon made the connection that Mu Ye had gifted it to Tang Doudou. When he came to this conclusion, his expression became irritated and he sent Little Gray flying with a flick of his sleeve. Little Gray crashed into the wall and cried out in pain.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t see Little Gray rush over and only heard his cry of pain. Her heart tightened and she lifted her leg to knee Bai Feiyun, but he dodged like he had expected this.</p><br/><p>He then pressed his knee on her thigh so that she couldn\u2019t move around any longer.</p><br/><p>Since she couldn\u2019t get away from Bai Feiyun, she looked over in the direction Little Gray had fallen and shouted, \u201cLittle Gray! Little Gray, are you alright? If you\u2019re alright, give me a squeak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Gray was quite severely injured. When he heard what she said, he squeaked weakly in an apologetic tone, and then there was no more sound. \u201cBai Feiyun, how did you become like this? Little Gray is just a little monkey, he can\u2019t hurt you at all. Why did you hit him so hard?\u201d When Tang Doudou heard how weak Little Gray was, she felt unbearable heartache. He was just a tiny little thing, how could he possibly bear Bai Feiyun\u2019s ruthless attack?</p><br/><p>The more Tang Doudou thought about it, the angrier she got and she started struggling like crazy. \u201cLet go! You perverted shameless hoodlum! I must have been blind before! Let me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you move again, I\u2019ll kill that animal!\u201d Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t get angry when Tang Doudou struggled and just said this lightly. Then he reached out and forced Tang Doudou to face him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a perverted shameless hoodlum?\u201d Bai Feiyun laughed softly. His originally warm tone now seemed to contain a slightly demonic flavor. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I am a perverted shameless hoodlum. Are you scared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was completely bewildered. She never thought that Bai Feiyun\u2019s attitude would change so quickly. The aura he was currently emitting was completely unfamiliar and cold, she couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy. She started looking around in a fluster to try to see where Jun Xin was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you looking for? Jun Xin? He\u2019s probably too busy to look for you right now.\u201d Bai Feiyun noticed that she was looking around and said this with a cruel smile.</p><br/><p>What happened to Jun Xin?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he had attacked Jun Xin as well?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t possible. Based on how strong Jun Xin was, there was no way Bai Feiyun\u2019s attacks would have any effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wonder anymore. I can\u2019t beat him, but there are people that can and they might even kill him.\u201d Bai Feiyun put more pressure in his fingers and kept Tang Doudou\u2019s head firmly locked in place. He leaned down and his breath passed Tang Doudou\u2019s lips to stop near her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had best behave and stop moving around, otherwise I won\u2019t be able to guarantee Jun Xin and that animal\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou still had no idea what Bai Feiyun was trying to get at, but she could tell he wasn\u2019t just buffing. She was panicking, but she forced herself to remain calm and glared at him. \u201cWhat exactly are you trying to do? If you hate me, just direct it towards me! Don\u2019t implicate other people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I want to do? Isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Bai Feiyun lowered his voice and his usually gentle voice became low and hoarse, causing the atmosphere to feel very suggestive.</p><br/><p>She could feel the heaviness on top of her and had to focus to keep her breathing even. She looked disbelievingly at him, not knowing how to reply.</p><br/><p>What he wanted to do was obvious. She wasn\u2019t a fool nor some innocent daughter that was kept in the lady\u2019s chamber. She could see the suppressed feelings and that dark hatred in his eyes that seemed to want to destroy everything. Those two strong conflicting emotions caused his usually gentle features to become extremely sinister.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that I\u2019m a shameless hoodlum? Then I\u2019ll show you what a shameless hoodlum is like!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after he said that, a burst of hot breath seemed to hit her and he started biting at her crazily. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth. Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes widened and she started screaming in panic.</p><br/><p>However, at the end, that sound changed into uncomfortable whimpering. After a long time, Bai Feiyun finally released her while panting. He seemed like a rabid beast as he stared at her with red eyes.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was frightened by that fierce look in his eyes. A moment later, she felt his hand slide down and he moved in to bite her again.</p><br/><p>A thought abruptly flashed through her mind and before she could even reconsider it, she blurted out, \u201cBai Feiyun, do you find it fun to bully a pregnant woman!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun abruptly froze. The craze in his eyes faded away and was replaced by complete bewilderment. When that cleared away, he slowly looked towards her abdomen. Perhaps because his conscience flared up, he released her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou took advantage of this chance to push him away and while he was still stunned, slapped him hard. \u201cBai Feiyun, if anything happens to Jun Xin, I\u2019ll definitely kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she walked to the wall, picked up Little Gray, and jumped over the wall to vanish into the distance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Right after Shen Moru said this, blood leaked out from the corners of his mouth and his eyes burned even more fiercely with fury. He had never imagined that Tang Doudou would have the nerve to openly use the fruits of the sacred tree to poison him.</p><br/><p>How did he end up being captivated by that dish? Now this was just great. He was immune to a lot of poisons but he just happened to be abnormally sensitive to the sacred tree\u2019s fruits. He had only eaten a small piece earlier, but the new meridians that he had spent the last three months carefully remaking were already ruined.</p><br/><p>By the time he digested this poison and repaired his meridians again, these two would probably be at the other end of the world. It would be much harder to catch them a second time!</p><br/><p>Moreover, Baili Yu was currently searching frantically in the outside world. If these two escaped from Tree Valley and brought people back, Tree Valley and the sacred tree would be doomed!</p><br/><p>When Shen Moru thought up to here, his cold eyes filled with murderous intent. \u201cGrandma Shen, don\u2019t hold back. Kill that brat and put Tang Doudou in the tree prison!\u201d</p><br/><p>Back then, he shouldn\u2019t have taken into consideration that she was that woman\u2019s daughter and allowed her to live in a place as comfortable as the tree house!</p><br/><p>As Shen Moru regretted his past deeds, Tang Doudou had already regrouped with Mu Ye. \u201cFrick! That damned old woman tricked me into drinking knockout drops. Hurry up and escape with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye didn\u2019t say anything and simply lifted her onto his back as he blocked Grandma Shen\u2019s attack with a tree branch.</p><br/><p>\u201cManer, help me stop them!\u201d Grandma Shen\u2019s martial arts was at the same level as Mu Ye\u2019s. When she saw that she couldn\u2019t stop Mu Ye, she shouted for Nan Maner who was, as always, staring dazedly at nothing.</p><br/><p>Nan Maner returned to her senses. \u201cW-w-what\u2019s going on-yo!?\u201d</p><br/><p>All she had been told was that Mu Ye and Tang Doudou were Grandma\u2019s guests and that the Saint King ordered her to keep an eye on them. She had no idea that any animosity existed between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, hurry up!\u201d urged Grandma Shen.</p><br/><p>While she was speaking, Mu Ye just happened to pass by Nan Maner. His cold eyes swept over and the inner strength Nan Maner had just gathered up completely dispersed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! If you don\u2019t help, Grandma will throw you into the tree prison as well and allow you to experience the taste of being nibbled away by ten thousand bugs!\u201d threatened Grandma Shen.</p><br/><p>Nan Maner didn\u2019t dare talk back anymore, she reached out to block Mu Ye but was immediately sent flying by his palm strike.</p><br/><p>She crashed into the dense branches.</p><br/><p>A trace of surprise and worry appeared in Mu Ye\u2019s eyes when she fell, but when Nan Maner started screaming, those emotions faded. Following that, he leapt off the tree without turning back.</p><br/><p>Grandma Shen glared at the back of the two figures. Nan Maner jumped out from the branches and said, \u201cAiyohey! Man attacks way too ruthlessly-yo! Doesn\u2019t he know to pity the fragrance and cherish the jade? See how I\u2019ll sort him out once I catch him-yo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, she ignored Grandma Shen\u2019s attempts to stop her and chased after Mu Ye and Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Grandma Shen angrily rapped the ground with her clutch. At the side, Shen Moru said, \u201cStop being angry and come help me cure the poison!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye quickly passed through the village beneath the tree. When those usually idle villagers saw them, they immediately rushed up to intercept them.</p><br/><p>There were quite a few people with pretty good martial arts, so it caused Mu Ye\u2019s speed to slow down. Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t fallen unconscious yet, when she saw this, she couldn\u2019t help but become anxious. The fact that Grandma Shen hadn\u2019t chased after them definitely meant that she was treating Shen Moru\u2019s poison. She had amazing medical expertise and might be able to cure Shen Moru in just a few minutes. Once Shen Moru was cured, they wouldn\u2019t be able to escape anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye, don\u2019t fight with them anymore, hurry up and leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye kicked down the men that were rushing up and nodded. \u201cCan you still hold on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m only dizzy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrab onto me tightly, don\u2019t fall!\u201d After he said that, he stopped holding onto Tang Doudou. Pulling out his iron chain from his waist, he swung it out. The iron chain flashed with blackish-purple light as it swept all the people blocking them to the ground.</p><br/><p>Following that, he held onto Tang Doudou with one hand and threw the iron chain towards a low branch of the sacred tree with the other. He then swung them forward and flew away from the village, and landed in front of the small black road that they had taken before. Without a pause, he shifted Tang Doudou from his back into his arms and entered while holding onto her tightly.</p><br/><p>When they got to the stalactite cave, Tang Doudou felt his body tense up as if he sensed great danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t disturb that snake.\u201d Just that one snake would hold them up for a long time. She looked towards Mu Ye. He nodded at her, indicating for her to hold her breath. Then he started walking forward soundlessly.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s heart tensed when they got near the pond. She stared nervously at the pond, worrying that the snake would suddenly jump out. Although Mu Ye didn\u2019t look away either, he moved very quickly and they were soon about to leave the pond.</p><br/><p>Crash!</p><br/><p>There came the sound of something breaking through the water, then an enormous figure abruptly rushed out of the pond and appeared above the two.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou covered her head in alarm while Mu Ye hastily retreated backward. He crashed through countless hanging stalactites but didn\u2019t even crease his brows as he picked a different direction and ran.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

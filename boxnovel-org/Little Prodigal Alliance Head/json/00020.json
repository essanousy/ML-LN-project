He was even bewildered as to why everyone was looking at him as he ran to Elder Yu: \u201cElder Yu, Bai gongzi has brought the Alliance Head!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know! Withdraw!\u201d Elder Yu unhappily waved his hand, having him withdraw.</p><br/><p>So it turns out this servant wasn\u2019t the one sent out to find the witness testimony but was the one sent out earlier to find Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The one they saw wasn\u2019t the one they were looking forward to see. Everyone sighed, they\u2019ve wasted their expressions in vain.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t help complaining about Elder Yu again. Even though everyone was not happy with LI Xueyi being the Alliance Head, but it\u2019s not like everyone is dumb. It is reasonable to say that if Cloud City sent someone to take this position of Alliance Head, it\u2019s the most suitable.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This way, at least both sides would not have grudges due to this matter and cause turmoil in the Jianghu, creating an opportunity that the Imperial Court and the Demonic Sect can exploit.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The previous Alliance Head was chosen out of a martial arts competition. Although it allowed them to escape the conditions of Cloud City, making it so people didn\u2019t have to be subject to the pressure of Cloud City, but it allowed the Demonic Sect, the malignant tumor of the Jianghu, to rapidly increase in size, causing even greater damage in the end.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In short, there was more harm than good.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Besides, what everyone was dissatisfied with wasn\u2019t the fact that Cloud City sent someone to take up the position of the Alliance Head, but the fact that this person was Li Xueyi.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But now, it looks like though this youngster\u2019s age is not large, he\u2019s not frivolous. The way he speaks was unbridled, yet every sentence has a strong point. Moreover, his flamboyant domineering air, his general vivacious features, his utterly clear and sincere eyes, where were they as bad as rumored?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Rumors can\u2019t be trusted ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The people present were all intelligent people, especially Elder Yu, Xiao Yiyun, etc. Just looking at the expressions on everyone\u2019s faces they knew the situation was not good. Then looking at Bai Feiyun\u2019s tranquil without a ripple expression as he sat there drinking tea, it was obvious that the incident of the person he sent out returning so late was definitely not unrelated to Bai Feiyun!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Feeling anger in his heart, Elder Yu had no intention of letting Tang Doudou off just like this.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Elder Yu suddenly laughed heartily. Just as everyone felt a bit baffled, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s already pretty late. Everyone must be tired because of the matter of looking for the Alliance Head, you should all head back a bit early to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The moment these words were spoken, Tang Doudou almost thought that Elder Yu wanted to give up. But thinking again, how could that be possible?!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This crafty old fox definitely want to shake out some moths again*!</p><br/><p>Saying that basically means to make something out of nothing.</p><br/><p>Without Bai Feiyun\u2019s warnings, Tang Doudou could only be alert inwardly. Outwardly, she made an apologetic expression and cordially said: \u201cMy apologies, I\u2019ve made everyone take a lot of trouble over this Li. It\u2019s all because of that Demonic Sect looking for trouble! Causing the convention to be delayed for so long!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demonic Sect is way too abominable! They clearly knew that the convention was starting soon, yet they insisted on deliberately obstructing the Alliance Head! Isn\u2019t this an intentional act of instigation?\u201d An angry Syndicate Leader said.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Another Syndicate Leader said with deep thoughts: \u201cIsn\u2019t hosting the martial arts convention at Rutaceae Pavilion Alliance Head\u2019s, your last minute idea? How did the Demonic Sect find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>A beautiful woman from some female syndicate was also deeply concerned and said: \u201cI heard even the Sect Leader of the Demonic Sect came. Alliance Head, are you alright? You\u2019re not injured, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The hall became lively again with everyone throwing out one remark and comment after another.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Waiting until they\u2019ve pretty much finished discussing, only then did Tang Doudou wave her hand: \u201cI thank everyone for their concern. It\u2019s just unfortunate that while I was rushing to get back, their Sect Leader was able to escape while I was off guard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>No one knew what the situation at that time was like anyways, so wasn\u2019t it all up to Tang Doudou to make up nonsense about?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>And Elder Yu who knew the truth was angered to the point his mouth fell out of joint. It was clearly the appearance of the Pavilion Master of Rutaceae Pavilion that scared away Mu Ye and the rest.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Yet when it came through Li Xueyi\u2019s mouth, how did it turn into Mu Ye fleeing with his tail between his legs in disgrace?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Shameless! Way too shameless!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Yet he just couldn\u2019t expose the actual facts, dammit!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Elder Yu\u2019s fingers clenched tightly into a fist inside this sleeve and stayed that way for quite a while before slowly loosening. His expression was still mild, so what if he allows him to show off for a while longer? The more he shows off, the higher he\u2019ll be praised, then when he is thrown down the more pain he\u2019ll feel!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Picking up the tea next to him, Elder Yu once again swept a glance at Bai Feiyun. His rough voice is especially prominent in the hall: \u201cSince there\u2019s no doubt, then Alliance Head, please take out the Alliance Head Command Tablet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Alliance Head Command Tablet!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the originally calm Tang Doudou was immediately stunned. She looked frantically towards Bai Feiyun, where\u2019s the Alliance Head Command Tablet?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s eyes were also heavy. He indicated for her not to mess around and stomp on her own foot before slowly opening his mouth: \u201cElder Yu, are you suspecting the Alliance Head\u2019s identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Bai gongzi jokes. Why would I suspect the Alliance Head\u2019s identity? It\u2019s just that Bai gongzi, you haven\u2019t participated in the martial arts convention before, so you don\u2019t know this established standard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cEstablished standard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThe established standard is the Alliance Head Command Tablet! Alliance Head, Alliance Head Command Tablet. The person along with the command tablet commands the Jianghu. Seeing the command tablet is the same as seeing the Head!\u201d Elder Yu\u2019s words were powerful and resonating, quite a few people also agreed that this was true.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Meaning that she must take out the Alliance Head Command Tablet, otherwise just based on solely her, this Alliance Head, there\u2019s no way to command the Jianghu!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The hell, if she knew that plaything was this important, even if she was beaten to death, she wouldn\u2019t come here before she found it! Now where was she supposed to produce an Alliance Head Command Tablet from?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai ah! Xiao Bai, I\u2019m really about to be scammed to death by you!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

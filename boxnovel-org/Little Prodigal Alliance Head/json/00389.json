The Bai family was originally ranked last, but since the Murong family is filled with disappointing hedonistic sons that only knows to play around and use despicable means this time around and Bai Luoqing turned out to be a very skilled leader, the Bai family managed to surpass the Murong family greatly in just a few years. At this point, it\u2019s almost about to surpass the Xiao family. This woman is very ambitious, and at the same time, is very skilled at hiding her intentions. If you have to have dealings with her in the future, you should remember this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou recalled Bai Luoqing\u2019s strange smile when she left Azure Water Valley and smiled bitterly. \u201cI\u2019ve already gotten first hand experience with that. She truly isn\u2019t simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin scoffed. \u201cWho asked for you to be so dumb? If it were me, I would\u2019ve already sorted out that woman. Bai Feiyun had definitely become strange because of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>How did the topic get to Bai Feiyun again?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pushed Jun Xin\u2019s hand off her shoulder and picked up Little Gray. As she petted him, her eyes filled with melancholy. \u201cNo matter what, since that\u2019s Xiao Bai\u2019s choice, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin curled his lips disdainfully. \u201cFine, think whatever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced up. At some point, the sun had disappeared, leaving the sky gloomy and dark. Just the sight of it made her heart feel heavy. She looked away and said, \u201cIt\u2019s already pretty late, so I\u2019ll head back now. Are you going to continue following me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s follow the original plan. When you get back to Barbarian Mound Garrison, find a chance to take me in. It\u2019s too dangerous to just have me follow you from the shadows. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the mysterious person hadn\u2019t intended to kill you, you would\u2019ve already died dozens of times on the way here.\u201d He looked towards her apologetically and scratched his head. \u201cIt was my neglectance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou patted his shoulder. \u201cAren\u2019t I fine? Don\u2019t worry, I have good luck. I wouldn\u2019t die that easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe heck? With how unlucky you are, how you can still say that you have good luck?\u201d Jun Xin stood up. \u201cOnce this matter is resolved, you should have Baili Yu bring you somewhere far away. The Jianghu is seriously too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Tang Doudou looked towards him worriedly. However, because she was sitting, the first thing she saw what Jun Xin\u2019s exceptionally long legs whose slenderness was emphasized by his black boots. Because these legs were seriously too good-looking, she couldn\u2019t help but stare. While captivated, she blurted out, \u201cJun Xin, how old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin lifted his brows. \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou felt that it would be a bad idea to tell him that she wanted to play matchmaker.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had a very childish face and didn\u2019t look very old, but she had a feeling that this stinkin\u2019 brat wasn\u2019t that young.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour head\u2019s always filled with useless things!\u201d Jun Xin could tell from the way she was hesitating that she wasn\u2019t thinking anything good. He was about to rap her head again, but then couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. Instead, he pulled her up, then turned and used his leg to lift the bird cage. The movement was very smooth and handsome. After he finished this sequence of movements, he even sent Tang Doudou a wink.</p><br/><p>If this wink had been sent towards someone else, that person would probably be so infatuated that their head would spin. However, Tang Doudou just walked up, took the cage from him, then patted his shoulder with a serious sigh. \u201cIf your eye twitches uncontrollably, it\u2019s an illness. You need treatment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s face immediately turned black and he rapped Tang Doudou\u2019s head. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s ill!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, he disappeared from sight.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shook her head and placed Little Gray on her shoulder before starting to walk towards Barbarian Mound Garrison.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

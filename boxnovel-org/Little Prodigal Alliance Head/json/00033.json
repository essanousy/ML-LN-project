If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Tang Doudou convinced Meng Yu to push all the responsibility onto Jun Xin through giving countless assurances, how would Meng Yu possibly let it go just like that?</p><br/><p>He treated the wound while starting a fire in the stove to help warm up Tang Doudou. But that clothing had a lot of layers and was completely drenched. Roasting while wearing those layers simply didn\u2019t have even the slightest effect. He wanted to take them off, but he was also scared that Li Xueyi was a woman.</p><br/><p>After several rounds of silent debate, at some point the movements of his hands had stopped.</p><br/><p>Forget it, he\u2019ll just call a maid over after all!</p><br/><p>After weighing the pros and cons, Jun Xin finally decided on a plan. He added fuel and made the fire as large as possible, then added several more layers of blankets on Tang Doudou\u2019s body. Finally, he wrapped up the wound and immediately headed off to Moon Viewing Courtyard.</p><br/><p>In reality, Baili Yu was there so he really didn\u2019t want to go. But he was helpless, right now the only place with servant girls is Moon Viewing Courtyard.</p><br/><p>On the way there, he saw the food box that was still where it was earlier in front of the Moon Viewing Courtyard. After thinking about it a little, he picked it up and walked into the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Yu? Qing He? Qing Yun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Where did everyone go? Jun Xin was a bit surprised. Just a while ago there were still people, why did they suddenly all leave?</p><br/><p>Crap. Based on Baili Yu\u2019s temperament, if he left, then he probably won\u2019t leave a single person in the garden. But how can he leave just like that? Didn\u2019t he say he still had some matters to take care of?</p><br/><p>Unable to think of an answer and also worried about Tang Doudou, Jun Xin could only turn back.</p><br/><p>He had placed that food box on the table in the kitchen. When he left, he also forgot to bring it.</p><br/><p>Meng Ru was originally leaving, but who knew that when she was about to leave, she forgot to take the food box so she turned back. By chance, she just happened to miss Jun Xin. When she got to the kitchen, she saw the food box placed on the table, without even looking she directly took it and left.</p><br/><p>On another note, Tang Doudou woke up again. But this time, she was woken up by the heat.</p><br/><p>Her entire body was covered with sweat, it was unbearable.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my f-ing god which retard was it that wrapped xiao ye(me) in this many blankets?!\u201d Tang Doudou pushed at the thick blankets crushing her body, almost infuriated to laugh*. Her drenched clothes weren\u2019t even taken off. Being covered like this, even if she wasn\u2019t sick she would still be covered to the point that she got sick. No need to wonder, to do this kinda stupid thing, other than that idiot Jun Xin there\u2019s no one else.</p><br/><p>The common expression is infuriate to death. I\u2019m guessing at this point she\u2019s avoiding the word death because she\u2019s actually pretty close to dying? Or maybe she just finds it ridiculous to the point that she laughs.</p><br/><p>Regarding this, Tang Doudou was also extremely speechless. Pushing the blankets off her body, she discovered that her legs were still a little weak.</p><br/><p>But she couldn\u2019t pay attention to this now. If she didn\u2019t take off her clothes she\u2019d really catch a cold.</p><br/><p>Her head was fuzzy and heavy and her eyes were blurred, not completely open. She started peeling off her drenched clothes one by one through feeling and threw them all onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Little did she know, as she was stripping over here, on the other side outside the window was actually someone that was watching attentively.</p><br/><p>The sunlight outside the window was dim as it filtered through the tree branches, falling on Baili Yu\u2019s red clothes making them appear like flames. His seductive yao-like peach blossom eyes did not show the slightest emotion and just very calmly watched Tang Doudou take off her clothes one by one, revealing her pure and a little round shoulders.</p><br/><p>Only then did his eyes slightly narrow. That fiery red fox on the shoulder.</p><br/><p>His expression relaxed slightly.</p><br/><p>He is Li Xueyi.</p><br/><p>But how come, after the fifth time the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance flared up, other than losing his memories and martial arts, he seemed completely unharmed?</p><br/><p>That poison was also completely still inside his body, as if it wanted to become an integral whole with him.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou singlemindedly wanted to take off her clothes then squeeze into her blankets to warm up, how could she have know that there would still be someone peeping outside the window? Only when she had stripped down to her underpants did her hand finally pause on its surface. How come she seemed to have felt a gaze just now?</p><br/><p>Abruptly turning her head, that same split second, a red shadow flashed past outside the window and the two perfectly missed each other. When Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes fixated outside the window, there was already nothing under the tree.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no one? How weird.</p><br/><p>Even though she saw that there was no one there, Tang Doudou still walked over with large steps and closed the window.</p><br/><p>Just as she turned around muttering curses, Jun Xin charged in.</p><br/><p>Four eyes met and a tremendously loud shriek erupted inside the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one shouting in alarm wasn\u2019t Tang Doudou. She covered the flatness in front of her chest and her little beanbeans with particular calm and watched as Jun Xin screamed nonstop with a face full of terror as he looked at her. She was extremely speechless.</p><br/><p>Right now everyone\u2019s identity was male, at most she would be a bit embarrassed but she didn\u2019t feel that uncomfortable. After all, she still had a layer.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin screamed for a while before finally stopping on his own. Very humiliated and angry, he said: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing clothes?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all drenched. If I don\u2019t take it off should I just wait to catch a cold?\u201d Tang Doudou rolled her eyes, \u201cJust now, was it you that wrapped me in so many blankets?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t me then who else would take care of you ah!\u201d Jun Xin looked at her exposed skin and still felt a bit uncomfortable. His face flushed, then flushed again.</p><br/><p>He really is a man ah! Jun Xin\u2019s heart was a bit heavy. That chest was flat and level, on the lower abdomen there were distinct healthy contours, thoroughly smashing his earlier conjectures.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her head, currently having a terrible headache. She didn\u2019t continue to argue with him and squeezed into the blankets, finally a bit warmer.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Jun Xin was still dumbly standing there, she asked again: \u2018What are you still here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was my fault that you fell into the water and for not pulling you up in time, I also hold some responsibility for your current condition right now. Baili Yu has taken all the servant girls and left, if I leave as well there\u2019d be no one to take care of you. If something suddenly happened to you, your Alliance Head Residence\u2019s people will directly tear me apart to vent their anger.\u201d Jun Xin gloomily spoke. In reality, what he was kept thinking about was still Tang Doudou\u2019s culinary skills. Not to mention, he didn\u2019t have much to do in the first place and he felt that Tang Doudou was quite interesting so staying with him a bit longer was fine.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou closed her eyes. If he wanted to stay then just stay, she has to properly rest.</p><br/><p>Today she made spicy strips but in the end couldn\u2019t gift them, causing her to be especially regretful. She also didn\u2019t know when she would be able to make Baili Yu happy and have him cure her poison.</p><br/><p>Thinking of Baili Yu, she suddenly recalled what Jun Xin had just said. \u2018Baili Yu has taken all the servant girls and left\u2019, what did that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said Baili Yu and the rest all left?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin nodded, saying: \u201cYeah, they all left. But before they left they didn\u2019t bring you along so they\u2019ll definitely be back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said: \u201cThen when will that roughly be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that, but I think it probably won\u2019t be too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fudge, then when in the world can her poison be cured ah!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou covered her eyes, her head was hurting worse and worse. She had most likely already caught a cold. This is seriously the pits. How long has it been since she had transmigrated here? Yet she had already gathered up a pile of unfortunate events, it\u2019s seriously such a sad story.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Jun Xin, could you help with something?\u201d</p><br/><p>With her current situation, if she didn\u2019t look for a doctor and she really caught a heavy cold, in this backward technology and medical expertise ancient era, it was extremely probable that she could die.</p><br/><p>And there was also the injury on her hand, even though Jun Xin had wrapped it up, it was still scorching hot and painful. Probably it got inflamed after being moistened by water. Adding on the cold, it was undoubtedly adding hail to snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d Jun Xin was silent for a while before finally speaking.</p><br/><p>She saw that he seemed to be a bit unhappy but Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t pay attention to that much, \u201cHelp me look for a doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor?\u201d Jun Xin knitted his brows, \u201cWhat do you need a doctor for?\u201d</p><br/><p>WTF, if you\u2019re looking for a doctor would it be actually for the sake of discussing the meaning of life? Of course it was to get a health checkup! This dumb little brat is seriously no longer curable!</p><br/><p>In her heart she cursed Jun Xin for a tangent but on the surface she still very patiently explained: \u201cReceiving a chill in the middle of winter will probably cause a person to catch cold. Go find a doctor to prescribe some cold expelling medicine in order to prevent this illness from being dragged out and getting worse. The great youth is still here, I don\u2019t want to be cut off in my prime just like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin thought about it he also came to this conclusion, but he still had something he didn\u2019t understand, \u201cWhat does catch cold mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone shouted from outside the door, \u201cYoung Master Jun, Young Master Jun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s expression was surprised. Didn\u2019t Baili Yu take everyone and left? How could there still be someone here to look for him? Could it be that something happened? Thinking of that, he immediately went out.</p><br/><p>When he saw the person that came, he was surprised once again, \u201cSteward Ding, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster said he was going to stay in Huai City for a while, so he had me, this old bag of bones, come over to help sort out some of the trifling matters in the residence.\u201d Steward Ding was well over sixty. His shining white beard was grown very long and when he spoke it would twitch and shake, looking quite amusing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that.\u201d What was Baili Yu planning again? Jun Xin\u2019s expression showed that he completely didn\u2019t understand what that person was doing, but since he couldn\u2019t understand, he just won\u2019t think about it. He had always been this way. Instead, he just asked Steward Ding, \u201cThen why were you looking for me? You\u2019re already so up in years, isn\u2019t it tiring to run so far? Why didn\u2019t you send a servant to run over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Feiyun of White Wind Manor was outside, asking to see Master, but Master had left just a few moments earlier. This old servant was worried that there was a pressing matter so could only come and look for you, Young Master Jun.\u201d Steward Ding wiped the sweat on his forehead, even his breath while speaking was gasping and uneven.</p><br/><p>This Steward Ding was the only subordinate under Baili Yu that didn\u2019t know martial arts, but he held Baili Yu\u2019s deep trust. In Baili Yu\u2019s former residence, all the daily matters were arranged and taken care of by him.</p><br/><p>Steward Ding was very important to Baili Yu, and to Jun Xin, Steward Ding was also someone that watched him(JX) grow up.</p><br/><p>In regards to his tendency to like doing things personally the older he got, Jun Xin was also very helpless. But when he heard that it was Bai Feiyun that came knocking, he subconsciously turned to look towards the Tang Doudou inside the room.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou heard everything that went on outside loud and clear. Seeing Jun Xin look towards her, she immediately said: \u201cLet Bai Feiyun come in, he\u2019s a doctor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, she wasn\u2019t just having Bai Feiyun come in for the sake of looking at her condition. She had a lot of questions that she needed to clear up with Bai Feiyun.</p><br/><p>Just like the way she feels the need to be on guard against Baili Yu, she actually felt trust for Bai Feiyun from the bottom of her heart, it was just that she was a little resentful due to some of the things he did in the past. But they had only been apart a night and he already came to look for her, and came with such good timing too. So Tang Doudou immediately threw those resentments to the back of her mind. Xiao Bai ah, Xiao Bai, now that you\u2019ve come this time you should properly explain. Otherwise, she, Tang Doudou, will really have both her eyes painted black and be incapable of telling north from south.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin hesitated. If Bai Feiyun was just an ordinary doctor it would have been fine, he would have just allowed the person in without any objection. But he simply had to have a complicated identity and had an adversary relationship with Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Seeing him hesitate, Tang Doudou just asked disdainfully: \u201cJun Xin, are you scared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin immediately glared with wide eyes and angrily said: \u201cWhat would I be scared of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s Baili Yu ah. Otherwise is there a need to be this hesitant about just letting a person in? If you really are scared, that\u2019s also fine. Just send me out and let Bai Feiyun bring me back to the Alliance Head Residence. Baili Yu sure did put it nicely, saying he\u2019d let me come here to recuperate, yet now it caused me to not even have a single area on my body that is still healthy. Seriously makes people want to ask what the heck happened ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s scared of him! Li Xueyi, can you shut up? Isn\u2019t it just calling someone to take a look at your injury? What are you saying so much rubbish for.\u201d What Jun Xin disliked the most was when people say that he\u2019s afraid of Baili Yu. Even if he really was afraid of that guy, he still didn\u2019t want other people to say it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jun, just now when Master left he said the matters in the garden will all be up to Young Master, you, to handle. It\u2019s best if you give a decision so that this old servant can go back to give that Bai Feiyun a proper reply.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin turned to stone, did Baili Yu go crazy?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Bonus chapter in honor of Jack for declaring himself the main lead, Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by LazyMiyu, Proofread by Ocelot</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>Enjoy the bonus chapter lol~</p><br/><p>Glossary</p><br/>\n</div>"}

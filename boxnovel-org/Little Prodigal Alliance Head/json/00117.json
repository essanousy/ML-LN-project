Then, Gu Xun asked, \u201cWonder what matter is it that Alliance Head Li wishes to know about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple matter. I want to know the current whereabouts of the person that escaped earlier!\u201d Tang Doudou had no desire to obtain Old Suo\u2019s help but she really wanted to know whether that person was actually Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun wasn\u2019t surprised that she brought this up because she had already asked about this once before back when they were in the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Alliance Head Li is friends with that person? Could it be that the reason Alliance Head Li came to Mist City is for the sake of that person?\u201d asked Gu Xun, trying to probe for some information.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou replied, \u201cThat\u2019s actually not the case. I\u2019ve already said so before, it\u2019s all pure coincidence. Old Suo probably understands the whole story very clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter coming to Mist City, I happened to see something related to him. Hence I decided to try and verify it, that\u2019s all!\u201d Da fudge? She really didn\u2019t have any other intentions. It\u2019s just that once she left this place, she definitely must find people to shake this damned place out properly! To dare to kidnap her and try to sell her? The law practically did not exist in their eyes!</p><br/><p>Although it was true that the law also wanted to arrest her\u2026 When Tang Doudou recalled how she beat up Xi Qiulin in Huai City, she felt that it was probably best for her not to go back to Huai City after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem. Old Suo does owe Alliance Head Li an apology for this incident\u2026\u201d The expression in Gu Xun\u2019s eyes was a bit strange. Rumors said that Li Xueyi was the type to return every revenge tenfold. Old Suo had kidnapped him for no justifiable reason, but not only did he not get angry, he was even negotiating with them calmly. Why did all this feel so strange? Could it be due to his face? Was Li Xueyi allowing bygones be bygones due to the fact that he looked identical to Bai Feiyun?</p><br/><p>An apology? Could an apology heal the wound her heart suffered?</p><br/><p>F*ck! It was a good thing she was immune to that poison. Otherwise, she\u2019d probably be on the bed of some old man with some sort of special fetish right now!</p><br/><p>In short, this matter wasn\u2019t over!</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy, between brothers, what need is there for apologies? We\u2019ve been brought together by fate and we\u2019re all just people working to scrape together a living. What need is there for men to make things difficult for other men?\u201d T/N Tang Doudou waved her hand magnanimously. However, in her heart, she had already used her entire vocabulary of swear words to curse Old Suo and Gu Xun.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

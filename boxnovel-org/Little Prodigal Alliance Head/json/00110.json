She quickly fastened the belt before running over to open the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you take so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan walked in with Baili Yu\u2019s crowd of beautiful maids following behind. Tang Doudou searched the crowd, then asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Qing Yin? Why didn\u2019t Qing Yin come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin is still in Huai City dealing with other matters,\u201d said Ye Chuan. He directed the maids to carry Baili Yu out of the room. Tang Doudou followed after them. Right after they left the room, she saw the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin parked there. As before, its design was simple yet luxurious, and emanated a celestial-like aura.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was lifted into the palanquin in his unconscious state. Tang Doudou was just about to follow after him when Ye Chuan grabbed her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me. We\u2019ll be riding back on horse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pointed at the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin, then pointed at the horses nearby as she asked in astonishment, \u201cYou\u2019re not worried about these maids going by themselves? Not worried that they might encounter people from God Firmament Hall on the way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me to lead away the people from God Firmament Hall. They\u2019ll be taking a very secretive path.\u201d As Ye Chuan spoke, he pulled Tang Doudou to the horses. \u201cAlthough their martial arts skills are not very high, hardly anyone in this country would be able to keep up with their qinggong. Entrusting Master\u2019s journey to them is the best choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Ye Chuan gave a very detailed explanation, Tang Doudou refused to listen and flung away his hand. \u201cThat won\u2019t do. I have to go with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone knows about the relationship between you and Master. As long as you show up, the people from God Firmament Hall will definitely be lured away. That\u2019s the only way Master will have an opportunity to escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck? Your master is a human, but am I not a human as well? Ye Chuan, how could your heart be so black!?\u201d Upon hearing this, Tang Doudou immediately exploded. It\u2019s alright if you want her to be bait, but couldn\u2019t you freaking be a little more polite about it?</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t one of Baili Yu\u2019s subordinates. Was it worthwhile for her to risk her own life?</p><br/><p>Not to mention, there was no prior warning at all. She was suddenly pulled over and expected to just accept being used as bait?</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing is more important than Master\u2019s life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan declared this with conviction, ignoring Tang Doudou\u2019s furious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, your master\u2019s life is the most important, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan\u2019s expression did not change. His eyes stared fixedly at an open space in the distance. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright ah, then I\u2019ll just get on the horse!\u201d</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, Tang Doudou\u2019s imposing manner suddenly vanished. Beneath the scorching sun, she smiled even more brilliantly than the sun as she walked step by step towards the horses with her hands clasped behind her back. When she got close to them, she turned around and said calmly, \u201cBut Ye Chuan, I\u2019m warning you, you better not regret this after I get on the horse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan could tell that there was a hidden meaning within her words. This was a crucial moment so not a single thing could be neglected. Ye Chuan\u2019s figure flashed and he instantly appeared at Tang Doudou\u2019s side. He placed his hand on the horse, stopping Tang Doudou\u2019s momentum and keeping her from getting onto the horse as he asked with furrowed brows, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to know what I mean?\u201d Tang Doudou lightly pried Ye Chuan\u2019s hand off the horse, then bent it back towards his chest. \u201cSorry. I wanted to say it earlier but now\u2026 hmm, I don\u2019t feel like it anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she flung away his hand, jumped onto the horse, swung the whip, and rushed out.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan\u2019s hand was still in midair when the dust the horse kicked up hit his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBodyguard Ye.\u201d The maid saw that Tang Doudou had already rushed out so she hastily reminded Ye Chuan, \u201cWe should leave now as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan retrieved his hand. For some reason, what Tang Doudou said before she left caused him to be very uneasy. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t fathom what exactly she meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cProtect Master well!\u201d exhorted Ye Chuan. He then leapt onto a horse and rushed after Tang Doudou. The maids in the courtyard guarded the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin until a signal appeared in the distant sky. Then, they lifted the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin in the elegant manner akin to celestials and disappeared into the endless night.</p><br/><p>Once everyone left, Xu Sanniang moved out from behind a door. She smiled coldly as she glanced at the direction Ye Chuan left in, then gazed deeply in the direction Baili Yu left in. She pulled out an ash gray pigeon from her sleeve, then lifted it towards the darkness and released it whilst laughing.</p><br/><p>The pigeon flapped its wings and flew towards the sky, gradually getting higher and further away.</p><br/><p>Xu Sanniang watched it until it disappeared. Then she retrieved her hand and lightly stroked her face. Baili Yu ah, Baili Yu. Sooner or later you will belong to me, Xu Sanniang!</p><br/><p>Hahaha\u2026</p><br/><p>Her loud laughter reverberated in the courtyard, sounding almost insane.</p><br/><p>In a woodland about a thousand miles away, Feng Yunhuan lifted his hand and struck down the pigeon that was flying past overhead. He pulled out the tube attached to the pigeon\u2019s leg and took out the note inside.</p><br/><p>After taking a look at it, he revealed a pleased smile. Beneath his mask, his eyes darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell Fu Nongqing that the person she wants is heading towards the west.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Protector Feng!\u201d</p><br/><p>After his subordinate withdrew, he touched the bandaged wound on his forehead. You saved me once, but also almost killed me by hitting me. With this, the gratitude and grudges between us are cleared. Next time we meet, I won\u2019t show any more mercy!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his expression changed and he looked towards the lush forest behind him.</p><br/><p>There was a figure walking through the forest towards him. That person\u2019s imposing aura was so strong that each step seemed to crush his chest, causing him to have trouble breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is there!?\u201d shouted Feng Yunhuan. He was so nervous he didn\u2019t even notice how much his voice trembled.</p><br/><p>That person didn\u2019t make a sound. There wasn\u2019t even the sound of footsteps, breathing, or even a heartbeat. It was quiet. It was too quiet. It was as if the person was a demon that had walked out from the underworld, he did not seem to have the air of life.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t say anything, I will attack!\u201d Right now, Feng Yunhuan couldn\u2019t do anything to combat the pressure in his heart except to shout loudly in order to strengthen his nerves.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak! Who exactly are you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you human or ghost!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the last warning. I really am going to attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, no matter what he yelled, that person didn\u2019t seem to be affected. The figure simply got closer and closer, and that imposing aura became increasingly intense. Feng Yunhuan was forced to instinctively back away. He wanted to further retreat, but he was backed against an ice-cold rock wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come here! Go away. Go away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Feng Yunhuan could no longer take the pressure. He lost control and started screaming and flailing his arms, trying to stop that person\u2019s approaching steps.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

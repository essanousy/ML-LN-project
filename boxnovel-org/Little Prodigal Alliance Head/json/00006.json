It was also due to this portrait that he came in person, hoping to personally get rid of Li Xueyi.</p><br/><p>As for Mu Ye\u2019s appearance, the entire world had portraits of him, yet Li Xueyi was actually pretending that he didn\u2019t recognize him and even purposefully took liberties with him. This just further supported the rumors that Li Xueyi was matchlessly cunning with extremely deep schemes.</p><br/><p>Looking at the portrait, Tang Doudou also could not say anything for a while. Mah god, this was simply a coincidence within coincidences.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 Her heart also gave a thump. If she had transmigrated over as a soul and this body is that annoying pain-in-the-something Li Xueyi\u2019s, then that really is her!</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this way too much of a fraud?!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou tugged at the lower hem of her garment, an extremely important question suddenly occurring to her. </p><br/><p>If she remembered correctly, Li Xueyi should be a man!</p><br/><p>Therefore!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately reached down to touch her crotch area.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the face of the man in the attic and Mu Ye\u2019s face both turned black. A blood-red blade that was thin as a cicada\u2019s wing appeared in that man\u2019s slender fingers.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye crossed over with large steps and grabbed Tang Doudou\u2019s hand as he said in a chilling tone, \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m to\u2026 touching\u2026. Hehe\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou almost said touching her penis. Fortunately, Mu Ye\u2019s gaze was frightening enough to scare her into swallowing back the words in her mouth and giving a forced laugh instead.</p><br/><p>Luckily- luckily she wasn\u2019t a hermaphrodite!</p><br/><p>Li Xueyi was way too disgusting. Mu Ye, with one swipe, shook off her hand. Even though Tang Doudou didn\u2019t say it straight out, but in that area, besides that thing what else was there to touch? What a waste. Li Xueyi had such good martial art but was actually such a vulgar person. It couldn\u2019t be that because he touched him earlier, he got aroused and couldn\u2019t restrain his emotions so he wanted to\u2026</p><br/><p>The more Mu Ye thought about it, the uglier his expression got. He felt that killing Li Xueyi like this was way too easy and wouldn\u2019t serve to dissolve his anger. Since he liked men, then it\u2019d be best to just grant it to him!</p><br/><p>His eyes darkened. Turning away he commanded his subordinates, \u201cTie him up, bring him back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey!\u201d Tang Doudou looked at the black-clothed men who were approaching with rope then hurriedly flipped over and jumped up. \u201cIf you want to kill or cut do it more straightforwardly, you can\u2019t tie me up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heavens know where they\u2019ll take her back to. She\u2019s not stupid. She could tell from Mu Ye\u2019s expression that he wouldn\u2019t let her off easily. Rather than being brought to god-knows-where to be tormented, she would rather be allowed to just die here. Not to mention she might actually be able to transmigrate back!</p><br/><p>Mu Ye didn\u2019t even glance at her, he just turned and left.</p><br/><p>How could Tang Doudou let him leave just like that? She jumped up and kicked the thigh of the black-clothed man in front of her, then rushed towards Mu Ye. \u201cJust kill me, alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye watched coldly as Tang Doudou ran over. What trick did he want to play now? Could it be during the time that was stalled, the effect of the Tendons Softening Powder had worn off?</p><br/><p>The room wasn\u2019t large from the start. Tang Doudou didn\u2019t even have to run two steps before she managed to get to Mu Ye. Unfortunately, she truly ran too anxiously and Mu Ye just happened to be standing next to the doorstep. Therefore, even though she promptly braked, inertia allowed Tang Doudou to brush beautifully past Mu Ye\u2019s body. One foot tripped over the doorstep and with a thump she heavily fell onto the floor, stirring up a wave of dust.</p><br/><p>Omaigah*, her little meat buns!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Curious about why Murong Ming didn\u2019t fight back earlier, she asked, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that this Murong Ming really has an inclination towards masochism, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi glanced at her curiously and asked, \u201cWhat makes you think he has an inclination towards masochism?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he didn\u2019t, why didn\u2019t he fight back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, so that\u2019s what you were talking about!\u201d Su Yi laughed, then smoothed out his clothing. \u201cThat would require him being able to fight back ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou hit his pressure points?\u201d Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t think of any other explanation as to why Murong Ming wouldn\u2019t be able to fight back.</p><br/><p>However, Su Yi shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll know why once you recover your lost memories. There\u2019s no use telling you so much right now. Let\u2019s go see what\u2019s with that booklet first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two left the City Lord Residence\u2019s entrance.</p><br/><p>Murong Ming who had left earlier now reappeared and gazed after the two departing figures with a dark expression in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest gongzi, should we\u2026\u201d Another man with rather sinister facial features showed up with him this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo hurry.\u201d Murong Ming was much calmer this time around. \u201cGo investigate that person\u2019s identity first. It wouldn\u2019t be too late to make a move after we figure out who that person is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Master won\u2019t be able to wait that long.\u201d That man glanced towards Murong Ming with a discontent expression as he objected.</p><br/><p>From the start Murong Ming was pretty angry, now that the man said that, he became furious. \u201cWho do you think you are to criticize ben gongzi\u2019s decisions!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-th-this little one has spoken out of turn!\u201d The man hastily lowered his head humbly. However, hidden from Murong Ming\u2019s sight, a trace of cold laughter flashed through his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you know. What are you still standing here for? Hurry and go find ben gongzi a doctor!\u201d He didn\u2019t even know how badly swollen his face had become. Right now it was difficult to even speak clearly.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t get revenge for this, he was no nobleman!</p><br/><p>Li Xueyi, you just wait! Not only have you caused my younger sister\u2019s reputation to fall to the ground, you even dared call for someone to humiliate me! This crime cannot be forgiven!</p><br/><p>Originally he had been planning to give Li Xueyi a chance. As long as Li Xueyi\u2019s attitude was good and he was willing to take his younger sister as his wife, even if he liked men and wanted to keep some male companions they wouldn\u2019t have minded. It would have been fine as long as his little sister got married out.</p><br/><p>But Li Xueyi\u2019s current attitude clearly showed that he didn\u2019t want to take responsibility. Since this is the case, then Li Xueyi shouldn\u2019t blame him for being ruthless!</p><br/><p>How could Tang Doudou have possibly known that another person has started holding a grudge against her for no reason? As of now, she had already returned to the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce and was currently hiding the booklet shyly behind her. She deliberated over whether to show it to Su Yi or not.</p><br/><p>Su Yi waited at the door for half the day but Tang Doudou still didn\u2019t come out so he pushed open the door and walked right in. \u201cWhat are you dawdling for? Where\u2019s the booklet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t expect for him to abruptly strode in and hastily hid the booklet behind herself. \u201cI-I still haven\u2019t found it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hell, she was pretty bold but she still wasn\u2019t bold enough to look at this kind of inappropriate book with a man that she wasn\u2019t very familiar with!</p><br/><p>Maybe it was best not to let him look at it after all!</p><br/><p>She should just wait until she encountered Cang Baicao again to ask him if he had given her the wrong thing.</p><br/><p>Su Yi took in the changes in her expression. As a person with extensive experience, how could he be unaware of what Tang Doudou was thinking? However, he didn\u2019t show it on his face and pretended to look around in Tang Doudou\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait outside a little longer? I\u2019ll have Qing He bring you to Baili Yu and you guys can have some tea while you wait,\u201d proposed Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Su Yi seemed to agree with this suggestion because he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou loosened a breath in relief but before she could even relax her hand suddenly became empty. She hastily looked towards Su Yi.</p><br/><p>Su Yi had already begun flipping through the booklet.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was looking at it seriously without revealing any strange expressions, Tang Doudou kept quiet and simply gripped the hems of her clothes nervously as she watched Su Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the right one ah.\u201d After Su Yi looked through it for a while, he lifted his eyes and saw Tang Doudou\u2019s nervous appearance. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-nothing.\u201d Tang Doudou hastily released her garments and asked, \u201cYou said earlier that this was the right one, what does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis should be the method to cure the Hoarfrost Poison,\u201d said Su Yi. Then he seemed to suddenly think of something. \u201cThat\u2019s not right ah. Right now you\u2019ve lost your memories so you can\u2019t even understand this booklet. So what did Old Cang give this to you for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. If she knew then would she still need to look for Cang Baicao?</p><br/><p>Although, she was also pretty curious as to why something that looks like a \u2018little yellow rabbit\u2019 to her became a method to cure poison when Su Yi looked at it?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

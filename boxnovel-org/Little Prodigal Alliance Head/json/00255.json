He would have them hide until those people passed by before continuing on their way.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t kill them, it\u2019ll attract attention.\u201d explained Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou understood the logic. At the same time, she was stunned. She hadn\u2019t expected for the Seven Great Saint Tribes\u2019 security to be this strong. From the looks of it, there were probably many black-clothed men patrolling the forbidden grounds where she and Baili Yu were walking last night. It was just that Baili Yu had skillfully avoided all of them, which made it seem like they didn\u2019t encounter anyone.</p><br/><p>It was also fortunate that she later encountered Lan Jia. Otherwise she\u2019d probably be ascending to Heaven by now.</p><br/><p>When Lan Jia appeared in her thoughts, she wanted to ask about him again. She could tell from Mu Ye\u2019s words that he was very familiar with the Seven Great Saint Tribes. Su Yi had already told her before that people that were familiar with the Saint Tribes were definitely involved with them in some way.</p><br/><p>So in the end, was Mu Ye a descendant of the Saint Tribes or a guardian?</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout Lan Jia\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas he the one that led you out of the forbidden grounds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Tang Doudou nodded. \u201cWhy would he be so nice as to lead me out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has a very good relationship with Baili Yu,\u201d said Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou slapped her head. She was really dumb. Although Baili Yu disappeared suddenly, there was no way he would leave her in a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>However, could it be that he also knew that Mu Ye was here?</p><br/><p>She originally wanted to ask where Baili Yu was again, but gave up when she recalled that Mu Ye had ignored her earlier when she brought up Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>So she continued following Mu Ye while carrying the fruits.</p><br/><p>After walking for a long time, till her legs felt like they were about to fall off, Mu Ye finally said to take a break.</p><br/><p>In this manner, they walked with minimal breaks for an entire day and finally got away from that Ghost Village, then plunged into the dense mountain again.</p><br/><p>On the entire way, Mu Ye didn\u2019t eat or drink anything, and Tang Doudou could only use the wild fruits to fill her stomach. Although these fruits were tasty, how could fruit compare to meat? Traveling required a lot of energy and these fruits simply didn\u2019t provide enough. Soon, Tang Doudou\u2019s legs were starting to feel weak and it got increasingly difficult for her to lift her feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-mu Ye! I can\u2019t go on anymore, I need a break!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou leaned against a tree and stopped moving.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye came back and crouched down in front of her. \u201cGet on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d Tang Doudou pressed a hand on her forehead. In reality, she just wanted to eat something else. Even a small amount of dry rations would be good!</p><br/><p>Mu Ye said, \u201cThis place isn\u2019t safe. Endure for a little while. We can rest as soon as we get a bit further.\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused. \u201cI\u2019ve already carried you before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had an awkward expression on her face. If it weren\u2019t for what had happened with Qing Moran, she definitely would have jumped on without hesitation. However, ever since that incident she\u2019s had a strange feeling towards Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>When she still didn\u2019t get on, Mu Ye asked, \u201cAre you worried that Baili Yu would get jealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily shook her head. Even if Baili Yu were to get jealous, he\u2019d have to see it to be jealous. He wasn\u2019t even here, so why would she be worried about him getting jealous?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou tried walking again but she still couldn\u2019t move. She could only give in and get on his back. \u201cMu Ye, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye wasn\u2019t wrong. After about another hour, a forest appeared. They walked into the forest for a while and arrived at a concealed mountain cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest.\u201d Mu Ye set her down so that she could sit. \u201cI\u2019m going out for a bit. Don\u2019t make any noise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou replied \u2018en.\u2019 He then turned and left.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou guessed that he had gone off to get some food. Since this mountain cave seemed to be pretty far from any roads, she felt like it wasn\u2019t likely for anyone to wander in. Thus she decided to just lean against the rock wall and sleep.</p><br/><p>However, not long after she closed her eyes, there was a familiar rustling sound. She got up and saw that the little monkey had appeared at the cave entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Gray?\u201d called Tang Doudou. The small monkey immediately jumped up and cupped its hands to salute her enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was a bit surprised by the monkey\u2019s passion. She and the monkey didn\u2019t seem to be that familiar?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray scratched his head, then started bowing towards her again. He then rolled around on the floor making weird gestures as if he was trying to convey something.</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t understand it at all and could only ask helplessly, \u201cLil\u2019 Gray, what exactly are you trying to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s saying that someone\u2019s chasing after us.\u201d Right at this moment, Mu Ye walked in. \u201cWe can\u2019t rest here anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray became even more excited when he saw Mu Ye and rushed straight towards him. He quickly climbed onto Mu Ye\u2019s shoulder and rubbed against his face. Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know that Mu Ye knew Lil\u2019 Gray so she silently remarked \u2018crap\u2019 upon seeing this scene. For better or for worse, Mu Ye was the Leader of the Demonic Sect. After being offended by a monkey like this, he\u2019ll definitely smack Lil\u2019 Gray to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye, this is Lil\u2019 Gray. Don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Unexpectedly, before she could even finish her words, she saw Mu Ye smile towards the little monkey with a gentle expression in his eyes. He thenpatted the little monkey and moved it to his palm.</p><br/><p>He walked towards Tang Doudou and asked, \u201cLil\u2019 Gray? That\u2019s the name you came up for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. I encountered it earlier in Cerulean Mountain\u2019s forbidden grounds and just started calling i this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye lowered his head, then handed Lil\u2019 Gray to her. His ice-blue eyes still contained a bit of the gentle smile from earlier. \u201cI\u2019ll give him to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d Tang Doudou was too surprised to react for a moment.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye threw Lil\u2019 Gray into her arms and Lil\u2019 Gray nimbly climbed onto her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Gray, what a pleasant name.\u201d After he said that, he crouched down again. \u201cSomeone followed Lil\u2019 Gray over so let\u2019s hurry and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We\u2019ll probably be drenched by the time we get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>She kept saying \u2018Big Sister\u2019s place,\u2019 but didn\u2019t mention the City Lord Residence at all. From the looks of it, Feng Wu didn\u2019t live at the City Lord Residence.</p><br/><p>This made Tang Doudou curious. Hadn\u2019t Feng Wu rushed here from hundreds of miles away to find Su Yi?</p><br/><p>Leaving aside the fact for now that she rarely saw Feng Wu, why was Feng Wu living outside of the City Lord Residence?</p><br/><p>Feng Wu had probably guessed what Tang Doudou was thinking. As she pulled Tang Doudou and walked into the rain, she explained, \u201cIn regards to men ah, even if you like a person to the point he fills your heart, you must still maintain the haughtiness of a woman and can\u2019t lower your dignity too much. You can\u2019t allow him to feel that you wouldn\u2019t be able to live without him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, with this kind of distance it\u2019ll also make it hard for him to see through your thoughts, so from time to time he\u2019ll think of you. It\u2019s much better using this method than to keep bothering him every day and causing him to be sick of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was speechless. Feng Wu seriously had the talent to be the host of a relationship talk show.</p><br/><p>It was also to be expected. She had lived for so long, what hadn\u2019t she seen before?</p><br/><p>Constantly hanging around and bothering a man was indeed very annoying, especially when it was towards someone that didn\u2019t like you.</p><br/><p>It seemed that in the future she had to work hard and learn from Feng Wu so that Baili Yu would treat her considerately and sweetly. It\u2019d be best if he never goes out to attract butterflies and bees, especially things like female cousins and little junior sisters\u2026</p><br/><p>Baili Yu, who was in a distant inn drinking tea with Jun Xin, never would have imagined that his little wife had already, due to a couple words from someone, decided to maintain a set distance from him from now on.</p><br/><p>He had taken off his flirtatious red robe and changed into an elegant white garment that gave off a very celestial feel. He lay sideways on the couch, his fox-like eyes closed lightly. He only opened his eyes once Jun Xin finished talking about how he walked Tang Doudou back to the City Lord Residence.</p><br/><p>Looking towards the injury on Jun Xin\u2019s arm, Baili Yu asked softly, \u201cHow did you get injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin had already gotten rid of the poison and bandaged the wound. Hence, what Baili Yu saw right now was simply that a white cloth was wrapped around Jun Xin\u2019s arm. The condition of the injury couldn\u2019t actually be made out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was just a little accident.\u201d If he said that it was Nangong Yan who had made several attempts on Tang Doudou\u2019s life, this person would probably head over right now to personally kill Nangong Yan for revenge. </p><br/><p>However, there was only one outcome for that. The Island Master wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to Baili Yu, but he had countless ways to deal with Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was only a person; he wasn\u2019t god. Even if he had enormous capabilities, there was no way he could stay by Tang Doudou\u2019s side every day. That was why it was best for him to deal with this matter himself. No one would link his actions to Tang Doudou and it would actually instigate conflict between Wind Cloud Island and the Seven Great Saint Tribes\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Xin?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been too immersed in his thoughts and only snapped out of it after Baili Yu had called him several times. \u201cThat\u2019s all, nothing else happened. I\u2019m tired so I\u2019ll head back first to rest. If there\u2019s anything else, let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>He has always done as he said he would do when it came to deals with Baili Yu. Last time, he had agreed that as long as Baili Yu called him \u2018Ah Xin\u2019 again, he would come back to help and give up his desire for Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>The price Baili Yu had to pay was that he had to help him get revenge and help him protect Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was also someone that kept his word. That\u2019s why, when he called Jun Xin \u2018Ah Xin,\u2019 he had already completed the earlier deal. (I think it meant that Baili Yu had taken revenge for Jun Xin, aka killed someone or multiple someones for Jun Xin.)</p><br/><p>Although Jun Xin was rash and had also once considered killing Baili Yu, in the end he still couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. The brotherly friendship formed from once having fought side by side wasn\u2019t something that could be severed so easily. Moreover, he had misunderstood this matter the entire time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I want to know.\u201d Baili Yu sat up on the couch and gestured for the maids to withdraw.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin watched with confusion as those maids went out, then watched as Baili Yu stood up and walked to him.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s gaze was filled with complicated emotions as he looked at the Junior Brother in front of him that he had pretty much brought with him this entire way. He knew well that though Jun Xin looked as if he didn\u2019t care about anything on the surface, he had a heart that cared about things more than anyone else did. Baili Yu then recollected his emotions and said slowly, \u201cAh Xin, have you really thought everything through? Are you sure you won\u2019t regret this? You must know that choosing to help me is a path you won\u2019t ever be able to turn back from. You\u2019ve been with me so many years, yet you\u2019ve never agreed to it before\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin interrupted him without bothering to listen to the end. He replied decisively without hesitation, \u201cI won\u2019t! I won\u2019t regret!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, he looked straight at Baili Yu with a very resolute and sharp gaze. \u201cI also believe in you. I believe that you won\u2019t disappoint me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled. In comparison with those meaningful smiles from before, this smile was much more like a real smile. There were probably very few people in the world that had the chance to see him smile like this. \u201cAh Xin, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had to be admitted that Baili Yu\u2019s looks were way too beautiful. There were few people that could resist his looks when he smiled. Jun Xin turned his head away, refusing to look at this seductive yao as he said in a muffled voice, \u201cDon\u2019t celebrate too early. If I ever find out that you aren\u2019t treating her well, don\u2019t blame me for directly stealing her away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, don\u2019t worry, a day like that will never come!\u201d Baili Yu said it lightly, yet the words contained deep certainty and confidence. \u201cNow, you can tell me honestly, who exactly hurt you\u2026 and hurt her!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

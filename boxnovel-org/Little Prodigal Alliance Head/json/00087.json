He\u2019ll let the fact that Baili Yu didn\u2019t show enough respect for him go, but an insignificant daughter of the Prime Minister also dared to shout and roar in front of him without any trace of etiquette? And she even said that she wanted to discipline someone that belonged to Resplendent Imperial Uncle? How exactly does the Prime Minister teach his children?</p><br/><p>As he thought about this, he looked towards the Prime Minister da ren on his right with some complaints. After giving a cold humph, he said in a displeased tone, \u201cDo you all even wish for this competition to continue!? After zhen finally managed to head out, was it just for the sake of watching all of you voice complaints?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dragon countenance was so enraged that everyone hastily knelt down, panic-stricken. The Prime Minister was so terrified his face paled. With a \u2018putong\u2019 he knelt down in front of Xi Qiulin and said, \u201cYour Majesty, please forgive me. It\u2019s all this old subject\u2019s uselessness for not teaching his daughter well, causing Your Majesty\u2019s mood to be disrupted. Your Majesty, please declare a punishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there should be a punishment!\u201d Xi Qiulin stood up. However, without paying attention to the Prime Minister kneeling on the ground, he walked towards Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Da fudge? What was he about to do now?</p><br/><p>It is said that the emperor was a very frightening lifeform ah. Accompanying one\u2019s sovereign is said to be like accompanying a tiger. One little slip-up could make you lose your head!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer zhen, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Xi Qiulin walked till he was about five steps away from Tang Doudou and stopped to size Tang Doudou up before asking her a question.</p><br/><p>This time, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dare to speak any more nonsense. She fell to a kneel with a \u2018putong\u2019 and timidly replied, \u201cRe-replying Your Majesty, this servant, this servant\u2019s surname is Tang, name is Doudou\u2026 Tang Doudou\u2019s tang, red beans and green beans\u2019 dou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Doudou?\u201d Xi Qiulin repeated it once before sizing her up again. She was rather clever, just a little timid. As for her status\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere does your family live? Are your parents still living?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he asked this, Tang Doudou was stunned again.</p><br/><p>Jesus ah. This doesn\u2019t feel like a registered residence check anymore. It actually seems like an arranged marriage interview!</p><br/><p>F*ck! Did they misunderstand something?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s hard to say?\u201d Xi Qiulin asked.</p><br/><p>There was a limit to an emperor\u2019s patience, so Tang Doudou hastily replied, \u201cThis servant has no father or mother and is an orphan. Right now, this servant stays in Plum Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>She actually wasn\u2019t too timid. When Xi Qiulin saw that Tang Doudou started speaking nimbly, he nodded in his heart. As long as Imperial Uncle likes her, nothing else really matters. Earlier, he had already discovered that Imperial Uncle was restless in his seat. He never expected Imperial Uncle would be impatient to the point that he seized the girl the moment she stepped up to present her dish and questioned her nonstop. It would be strange if this didn\u2019t end up scaring the girl away.</p><br/><p>Looks like he must step out for Imperial Uncle after all. The competition was a small matter, Imperial Uncle\u2019s big matter of a lifetime was much more important.</p><br/><p>Bai Lianhua\u2019s family background and accomplishments weren\u2019t bad, so she can be the main consort. Since Imperial Uncle likes this Tang Doudou and she\u2019s lovable and adorable enough, she can just be a concubine attendant. This way, the whole set\u2019s complete. That\u2019s not bad!</p><br/><p>After thinking all this through, Xi Qiulin\u2019s expression relaxed a little. He lifted his hand towards Tang Doudou. \u201cYou may rise!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, don\u2019t kneel anymore, rise!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he went back to his seat. \u201cPrime Minister, disperse this audience. I think this competition should just be the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce\u2019s win!\u201d</p><br/><p>The championship is decided just like this? Isn\u2019t that too careless!?</p><br/><p>However, this person was the emperor, so who would dare to stand up and try to refute?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was pretty discontent with this as well. She wanted to obtain it with her own power. Winning like this wasn\u2019t satisfying at all, alright?</p><br/><p>She then glanced at Baili Yu. From the start, this guy had sat there silently and acted as a backdrop. Even now that the flames had almost spread to his own house, he still didn\u2019t send any signals. Tang Doudou was seriously at a loss.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to shift her line of sight, she saw Baili Yu nod towards her out of the corners of her eyes.</p><br/><p>Hell, I freaking pei! What could he possibly mean by nodding now?</p><br/><p>However, she soon realized what it meant and gulped. Freaking damned fox, you better not be trolling me!</p><br/><p>She closed her eyes and toughened her heart, then opened her mouth to cry, \u201cYour Majesty! You must not ah! Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty! Please reconsider!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, when she cried out, another voice had appeared at the same time. Tang Doudou looked over, surprised, and discovered that it had actually been San Yu.</p><br/><p>On second thought, this was quite reasonable. From the looks of San Yu, she seemed to be a girl that was quite arrogant. Having such accomplished culinary skills, how could she be willing to lose before she even competed?</p><br/><p>She actually had the same kind of thoughts as Tang Doudou, which was why that incident of them crying out at the same time occurred.</p><br/><p>How could Xi Qiulin not be aware of how these two people felt? However, he didn\u2019t want to waste time here anymore. He came to watch this competition purely for the sake of using up some time. However, there was a more important affair now, so naturally he would choose to attend to the more important affair.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, he, the grand majestic Emperor had made a decision. Even the Prime Minister and his Imperial Uncles didn\u2019t dare to harbor objections. Are these two yatous planning to revolt?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two have objections towards zhen\u2019s decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>Da fudge? Tang Doudou inwardly rolled her eyes in a huge circle. Is this a freaking muddle-headed rulerT/N?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty is clear-sighted and wise. This servant dares not have an objection to Your Majesty\u2019s decision. However, this decision is indeed way too unfair towards this servant and Lady San Yu!\u201d Tang Doudou gritted her teeth and snatched the chance to speak before San Yu could after seeing the trace of fierce resolution and melancholy on San Yu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Even though she didn\u2019t want to be kindhearted like Mary Sue, but for some unknown reason, when she saw San Yu\u2019s expression, her heart quivered like it had been stabbed. She felt that San Yu must have gone through quite a lot in the past and this culinary competition may mean more than just an ordinary competition to her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know where this intuition came from. In any case, by the time all these thoughts occurred to her, she had already acted.</p><br/><p>She was lifting her nose and giving him an attitude right after he acted a little amiable towards her?</p><br/><p>Xi Qiulin\u2019s facial color darkened and he didn\u2019t reply to Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, San Yu shot a grateful glance towards Tang Doudou, then knelt in front of His Majesty and spoke earnestly, \u201cPerhaps from Your Majesty\u2019s point of view, our culinary competition is nothing but an amusing pastime. However, for us servants, it\u2019s as important as our lives! Winning or losing does not matter to this servant, but to lose before even competing? This servant, this servant cannot accept it! Even if this servant may be facing a charge of the greatest crime under heavens, this servant still wishes to ask Your Majesty to continue this competition!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this and seeing San Yu\u2019s unyielding expression, everyone present was rather moved. Although His Majesty might not know about this, they were all from residences that were competing and had used a lot of time and effort to prepare for this competition. They truly felt that a careless decision like this wasn\u2019t appropriate.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Xi Qiulin smashed the wine cup in his hand towards the ground as he said in a cold infuriated tone, \u201cAre you trying to pressure zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>San Yu\u2019s face turned pale. \u201cThis servant dares not!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDares not! Dares not! What a great \u2018dares not\u2019!\u201d Xi Qiulin was so angry his chest was heaving rapidly. The attendant next to him hastily helped to calm his circulation as he sent a meaningful look towards Xi Qiuyue.</p><br/><p>This matter was something he started. If it weren\u2019t for that \u2018wait\u2019 he said, why would so many troubles have popped up afterwards?</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue was also aware. After seeing that attendant\u2019s look, he gave a light cough and said, \u201cYour Majesty, please quell your anger. They\u2019re just anxious about the competition and do not mean to disrespect Your Majesty. Rather, it\u2019s this competition! From what I see, the food has already cooled, so why not fix a date for a rematch?\u201d</p><br/><p>With this, it also gave His Majesty face and didn\u2019t neglect the competition. It satisfied both, no, all three sides wonderfully. Some other day he has to go figure out what exactly Tang Doudou was doing here.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue thought his suggestion would definitely be accepted, yet unexpectedly, right after he finished speaking, San Yu strongly opposed it. \u201cThis competition was set since ten years earlier. The culinary arts world had been waiting for the result of this competition since long ago. This servant hopes Your Majesty and wang ye will reconsider!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now what she said was a little abnormal. Even if they were all waiting for the results of the competition, it was nothing but one sentence from His Majesty. To insist on getting the results now, could it be that she was rushing to make it in time for some matter?</p><br/><p>San Yu was participating in the competition as the representative of Bai Residence. Today, firstly the Bai family\u2019s Miss came out with an arrogant burst of words without paying attention to her status, then the Bai family\u2019s kitchen maid contradicted His Majesty\u2019s words. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the Emperor kept the Prime Minister\u2019s hard work and great accomplishments in mind, he would have already called for someone to drag this audacious kitchen maid out and execute her!</p><br/><p>Thus, Xi Qiulin didn\u2019t continue to speak and just swept his glance towards the Prime Minister da ren who was continuously wiping his sweat.</p><br/><p>The Prime Minister was seriously panic-stricken ah. Normally, this San Yu was very obedient. How did she end up so thoughtless today?</p><br/><p>He naturally couldn\u2019t understand what San Yu was thinking in her heart.</p><br/><p>When he felt Xi Qiulin\u2019s gaze, he could only toughen the skin of his scalp to say, \u201cSan Yu, don\u2019t mess around anymore. Hurry and tidy up to prepare for the rematch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Prime Minister da ren, you\u2019ve promised. As long as this servant wins this competition, you\u2019ll grant one of this servant\u2019s wishes. The time limit falls right on this day. If it\u2019s a different day, wouldn\u2019t it no longer be valid!?\u201d When she got to the very end, this tough and obstinate yatou actually seemed on the verge of crying.</p><br/><p>It looks like what she said earlier about being unconcerned with victory was nothing but empty fart.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyoh, I was just saying it casually child, how did you end up treating it seriously!?\u201d The Prime Minister didn\u2019t expect for San Yu to mention this matter right here. Wasn\u2019t that demanding his old life!?</p><br/><p>After finding out that this incident originated due to the Prime Minister\u2019s, Xi Qiulin\u2019s facial color became even uglier.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince San Yu needs to win, then why not give the victory to San Yu? After all, from what ben wang sees, their culinary skills were both pretty good\u2026\u201d Xi Qiuyue gave a forced laugh, trying to loosen the tension of the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Originally, Tang Doudou had the same idea. However, it occurred to her that doing this might make San Yu feel even more insulted and unwilling to accept.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou could also understand what she meant. She didn\u2019t place importance on victories, but some matters required absolute victory.</p><br/><p>In any case, it was a very complicated matter.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiulin\u2019s entire belly was filled with anger, but he didn\u2019t want to explode in front of Baili Yu and be laughed at.</p><br/><p>From the start, Baili Yu acted as if this competition had nothing to do with him. The only time he was a little strange was when he stared at that kitchen maid, Tang Doudou. However, he must have decided it was boring after all afterwards and stopped paying attention. Currently, he seemed like he was almost about to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>Xi Qiulin had no idea what exactly he came here today for!</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t matter. In any case, he wanted to set up an engagement for Imperial Uncle today so he\u2019ll set everything else aside. Once he finish setting up the engagement, he\u2019ll just head back to the palace. He didn\u2019t want to bother dealing with this pile of trifles anyways.</p><br/><p>As his thoughts got to here, Xi Qiulin waved his hand. \u201cThen so be it, you may discuss this amongst yourselves afterwards. Zhen will be returning to the palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, quite a few people loosened breaths of relief. They had even left out many of the competition procedures for fear of boring and, in consequence, angering him. Unexpectedly, he was still angered in the end.</p><br/><p>Even as they thought about this, they knelt down to respectfully send off Xi Qiulin.</p><br/><p>However, he waved his hand again. \u201cBefore returning to the palace, zhen still has one matter zhen wishes to make clear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe ask Your Majesty to please enlighten us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial Uncle, zhen sees that you\u2019ve already gotten to an age when you should settle down and get married. The looks of this lady, Tang Doudou, is not bad and she matches you quite well. What does Sangfroid Imperial Uncle think about zhen making the decision for you and bestowing her to you to be your wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou instantly turned to stone. This Emperor wasn\u2019t only muddleheaded, he also seems to love creating messes as well ah. Da fudge? What was he bringing up marriage for while they were in the middle of a normal competition!?</p><br/><p>And he\u2019s planning to betroth her to Xi Qiuyue. The hole in his brain sure was big enough!</p><br/><p>As for Xi Qiuyue, he was so shocked that his mouth dropped big enough for a chicken egg to be stuffed inside. Did his family\u2019s nephew turn muddle-headed from being emperor too long? This Tang Doudou was, w-was a man ah!</p><br/><p>And he\u2019s the man that\u2019s about to take Baili Yu as a bride!</p><br/><p>When this was brought up, Xi Qiuyue shuddered as if he sensed a not very pleased gaze. He nervously lifted his eyes to look towards Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>That person had, at some unknown time, started looking down at everyone with an expression that almost but didn\u2019t quite seem to be a smile. His lips formed a few seemingly casual words. \u201cYour Majesty wishes to betroth my wife to the Sangfroid Prince. Before you do so, shouldn\u2019t you ask for my opinion first?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

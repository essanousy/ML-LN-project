He stood up and was about to call out \u2018Lady Doudou\u2019 when he noticed that Tang Doudou was wearing male clothing and immediately changed his words, \u201cAlliance Head, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Do I not look alright? That\u2019s right, Xiao Dao, what happened to you? Why did it take you so long to arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao replied in a helpless tone, \u201cI found people from the Chamber of Commerce in Cloud Semblance City, so after getting money from them, I immediately returned. In the end, Golden Wind Jade Dew told me that you had already left. I didn\u2019t believe them, so I called for people to capture them, then came to Huai City to look for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You captured them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right ah. I didn\u2019t know whether they were telling the truth or not. What if it was a lie and I not only ended up not being able to find you but also let them escape?\u201d explained Xiao Dao, embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Fine, what he said made sense but\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou asked, \u201cThen where are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao pointed towards the entrance. \u201cThey\u2019re right outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was simple and crude enough. He had directly kidnapped the people from Green Summit Stronghold and brought them here. And she had been remarking about how slow he was. This speed was practically flying fast, alright?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily ran out. Before she even saw Golden Wind Jade Dew with her eyes, she could already hear Yu Fenger cursing in his unique intonation.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bastards, you better pray that you don\u2019t fall into my, Yu Fenger\u2019s hands! I-it, it\u2019s seriously infuriating!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFenger ah, you should save your strength. You\u2019ve been scolding them the entire way here. Jin ge\u2019s heart aches for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy, wonder where that little sister of ours is right now. Did she get to Huai City safely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even having fallen to this point, Yu Fenger was still worrying about her. Tang Doudou\u2019s nose stung and she had to force back her tears before looking over. The moment she looked, she couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. These two big brothers of hers were sure cute.</p><br/><p>Xiao Dao who followed her out was also stunned for a moment before he explained embarrassedly, \u201cTheir martial arts skills are very high, none of the people I brought over were any match for them. They voluntarily allowed me to capture them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at the rope that was strung around Golden Wind Jade Dew practically as decoration, then glanced at the hidden guards that were continuously feeding the two grapes. Their expressions were all helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Yu, Big Brother Jin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, that\u2019s our little sister\u2019s voice!\u201d Yu Fenger who was laying on his back immediately pushed away the grape from in front of him and sat up to look this way. When he saw that it was really Tang Doudou, he immediately ran over excitedly. The rope on his body dropped to the ground on its own with this movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Yu, I\u2019ve made you guys suffer. Xiao Dao didn\u2019t know that I had already returned and not only bothered you but even brought you guys here. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy, it\u2019s fine!\u201d Yu Fenger looked Tang Doudou up and down, then glanced at the Alliance Head Residence behind her. \u201cDoudou ah, why are you living here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout this, I\u2019ll tell you more in detail later. Big Brother Yu, you two must be tired from the journey. Come in first and rest for a while.\u201d Tang Doudou called Xiao Dao, then made to lead Golden Wind Jade Dew inside.</p><br/><p>However, Yu Fenger pulled her to a stop. \u201cDoudou, your Jin ge and I are happy to see that you\u2019re fine so we\u2019ll leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Yu, if you guys don\u2019t want to come in I won\u2019t force you to either, but we\u2019re already at the door so why not come in and sit awhile? It couldn\u2019t be that two big brothers dislikes Tang Doudou\u2019s place and thinks it\u2019s too unpresentable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not\u2026\u201d Yu Fenger glanced inside the Alliance Head Residence, then pulled Tang Doudou to the side. \u201cDoudou, you\u2019re also aware of the kind of business we\u2019re in. How could we dare to go into the Alliance Head Residence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Tang Doudou realize this problem. It really wasn\u2019t that appropriate for Golden Wind Jade Dew to enter the Alliance Head Residence with their status, but how could she allow them to leave without entertaining them when they had already come all the way here?</p><br/><p>Just as she was at a loss over what to do, Bai Feiyun walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two are Golden Wind Jade Dew?\u201d There was a warm smile on his face but the expression in his eyes was deep as he looked at the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, that\u2019s us. You\u2019re Bai Feiyun, Bai gongzi, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of fear flickered in Yu Fenger\u2019s eyes as he was talking to Bai Feiyun, and he retreated backward a little.</p><br/><p>Sensing that the atmosphere was a little off, Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes whirled, then she moved to stand right in between the two. Laughing with a \u2018hehe\u2019, she said, \u201cXiao Bai, Big Brother Yu and Big Brother Jin came from far away, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun said lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m prohibiting them from entering, but do you dare to bring them inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She would sometimes take a walk around, chat with Qing Yin, and cook with Meng Yu. However, Jun Xin had arranged for quite a few people to secretly keep an eye on her just in case.</p><br/><p>Then he went off to prepare for the trip to Cerulean Mountain. The day before they were set to head off, Mu Ye came.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys can\u2019t go to Cerulean Mountain!\u201d This was the first thing he said.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin rolled his eyes at him. He heard from Baili Yiling that Mu Ye had also been in Cerulean Mountain. However, he had appeared at strange times and in strange locations, so she had no idea what he had been doing there.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t all that strange though. Mu Ye\u2019s doings had always been mysterious.</p><br/><p>He had already been aware that Mu Ye was interested in objects related to the Seven Great Saint Tribes from before when he was tracking him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go either, but if I don\u2019t go, I won\u2019t be able to find out the truth. If I don\u2019t find out the truth, a certain person wouldn\u2019t be able to recover. For her sake, of course I\u2019d go to Cerulean Mountain. Even if it was a sea of flames and blades, I\u2019d still rush in to obtain answers for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye simply repeated, \u201cYou guys can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin laughed angrily. Who did Mu Ye think he was? Did he really think he had the power to decide this for them?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll venture to ask Sect Leader Mu, why can\u2019t we go?\u201d Jun Xin didn\u2019t change his mind easily. The only reason he asked this question was because he wanted to see what exactly Mu Ye was up to.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Mu Ye had saved Tang Doudou before, he wouldn\u2019t have been this patient.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye was silent for a few moments. Just as Jun Xin thought that he wouldn\u2019t answer, he said, \u201cLan Jia is definitely waiting for you guys to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLan Jia?\u201d Jun Xin raised his brows. \u201cBut my people said that they had seen him leave with their own eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat news is false,\u201d said Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Jun Xin was getting suspicious. How did Mu Ye know so much?</p><br/><p>Mu Ye glanced at him coldly, but his usually expressionless eyes actually contained a trace of emotion this time. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know. In any case, you two can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why would he be sad? Jun Xin was curious. \u201cMu Ye, although we aren\u2019t really friends, we\u2019re not strangers either. You should know my temper well. If you don\u2019t give me a good reason, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d change my mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to change your mind! You can go, just don\u2019t bring her with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Jun Xin narrowed his eyes and subconsciously started knocking on the table softly as he considered these words. \u201cSect Leader Mu, excuse me for not being able to understand. What exactly are your intentions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her go.\u201d Mu Ye glanced at him. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve already promised her. Since Sect Leader Mu knows about so much, you definitely know about what happened to her earlier too, right? Then you should know why we\u2019re going to Cerulean Mountain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Jun Xin even finished speaking, Mu Ye had slapped an object on the table. \u201cGive this to her. Once you do, she won\u2019t consider dying anymore and won\u2019t want to go to Cerulean Mountain anymore either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Jun Xin pinched the fragments of black on the table. \u201cHair?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll understand.\u201d After Mu Ye said that, he disappeared into the shadows.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin put away that bit of hair and stayed there silently for a long while before getting up to look for Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Baili Yiling were currently fishing by the river.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law, you\u2019re saying that your first time with Big Brother was here?\u201d Baili Yiling giggled naughtily. \u201cHehe, Sister-in-Law, give me the details! What exactly happened? In any case, there\u2019s no outsiders here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop joking Yiling, he was just lying to me. At that time, I didn\u2019t know that he had already found out about my gender. I really thought that we had done something after I got drunk. I was seriously hurt and scared!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until way later that I found out I just slept on the couch. He had gone out to take care of a matter. However, near dawn, he purposefully came back to tease me.\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s tone was very helpless as she recalled that time. Even now, she still felt complicated emotions. If she hadn\u2019t agreed to marry Baili Yu back then, would she be less hurt now?</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling giggled. \u201cSister-in-Law, Big Brother had definitely taken a fancy to you since way back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou laughed as well, melancholically. Now that she thought about it, it had only been a year since she had arrived here and met Baili Yu for the first time in Rutaceae Pavilion, so how could the time be described as \u2018long?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you two chatting about so happily?\u201d Jun Xin had been listening from behind a tree. When he heard the truth from Tang Doudou\u2019s mouth, his eyes became moist. Back then, it was precisely because he thought that they had already gotten together that he had angrily smashed Bloodthirster and went to God Firmament Hall.</p><br/><p>He had done it so that he could help her find the cure to the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance.</p><br/><p>That way, she wouldn\u2019t have to keep currying favor with Baili Yu anymore.</p><br/><p>When Baili Yiling saw him, she pouted unhappily. \u201cSister-in-Law, I just remembered that Feng Long still has work for me in the afternoon, so I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then be careful. Make sure not to be too rude and impudent when dealing with formal matters,\u201d exhorted Tang Doudou. Baili Yiling waved as she walked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you even know to warn others not to be rude and impudent?\u201d Jun Xin walked to her and took over Baili Yiling\u2019s position. As he picked up the fishing rod, he said, \u201cThis girl didn\u2019t even put a bait on. Was she trying to copy Great Duke Jiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>(Great Duke Jiang, aka Jiang Ziya, is the guy that fished with a straight hook, saying that the fish would come to him when they\u2019re ready. More info here)</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked over and saw that there really was no bait on the hook.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably going easy on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe had made a bet that the person who got less fish would go to Flowing Clouds Palace and give the person in charge a beating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke. If she wanted to go, she should just go. Why is she dragging you along?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this for now. How are preparations for Cerulean Mountain going?</p><br/><p>Jun Xin showed her what he was holding and said, \u201cJust now, Mu Ye came to find me. He said not to let you go to Cerulean Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t hear what he said clearly, but she got a good look at what he was holding.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

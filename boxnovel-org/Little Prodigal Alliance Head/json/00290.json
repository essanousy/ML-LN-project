It seemed that Shen Moru and Lan Jia had a falling out.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Mu Ye followed behind Shuyin and ran around the dark and complicated secret passage until a bright light appeared ahead of them.</p><br/><p>The group exited the secret passage only to find that they were still within the Saint Palace. It was just that they didn\u2019t know which palace hall they were in. A tumultuous fire roared nearby and sounds of people shouting as they worked to put out the fire mixed with the desperate pleas for help. Needless to say, this was the work of Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Shuyin shot a look at Mu Ye. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve saved you, hurry up and leave These matters are not for an outsider like you to interfere with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye moved his lips but didn\u2019t speak. Instead, he turned towards Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou recalled what he\u2019d said, He\u2019d go wherever she goes\u2026</p><br/><p>However\u2026 She put Lil\u2019 Gray on his hand. \u201cGo! Baili Yu\u2019s here, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye lowered his head to look at Lil\u2019 Gray. There was no emotion visible in his cold eyes. \u201cI will bury Senior at Dream Mountain when I get back. Remember to visit him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he disappeared into the vast sea of clouds with Lil\u2019 Gray.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this senior he was talking about?\u201d Shuyin asked.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou retrieved her gaze and answered, \u201cMy father.\u201d \u201cYour father?\u201d Shuyin\u2019s eyes narrowed with interest. \u201cWho was your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Mu Ye didn\u2019t say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHim?\u201d The mention of Mu Ye seemed to piqued Shuyin\u2019s interest. \u201cAnd who is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was speechless. \u201cHe\u2019s Mu Ye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Shuyin raised her brows as she hugged her shoulders. As she yawned, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go look for Baili Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had just been thinking about Mu Ye and failed to notice that the way Shuyin addressed Baili Yu had changed. When she saw that Shuyin was leaving, she moved to follow.</p><br/><p>When they finally found Baili Yu, he was in the process of getting out of the dusty secret passage. He was probably frustrated since he hadn\u2019t been able to find Tang Doudou inside before he slammed his fist against it and destroyed the passage he had just emerged from.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop venting your anger on those things! I\u2019ve already brought the person back for you!\u201d When Shuyin saw Baili Yu, she lifted Tang Doudou by her clothing and threw her over.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou, flung into the air, was speechless towards Shuyin\u2019s barbaric handling of her. She was fully prepared to land on the hard ground given the fact that there was barely any time for Baili Yu to react.</p><br/><p>However, she had underestimated Baili Yu\u2019s reaction time.In the next instant, she Doudou landed safely in his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoudou.\u201d His trembling voice came from above her head and it caused her to become flustered.\u201cI-I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s all thanks to Mother\u2019s speedy arrival.\u201d She hugged Baili Yu tightly as she greedily took in his scent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother?\u201d He asked in bewilderment. As he cupped her head, he asked, \u201cWho\u2019s this \u2018mother\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pointed towards Shuyin who had been yawning non-stop and asked, \u201cIs-isn\u2019t that our mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s face which was already gray from dust instantly turned as black as coal. He repeated again with a strange expression, \u201cMother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou could sense that Baili Yu there was a deeper meaning in his words so she looked over curiously, only to see that Shuyin was standing there was an unnatural expression on her face as she looked towards the sky, then the ground. \u201cAhem, tonight\u2019s moon is sure nice, it\u2019s perfect for couples to whisper sweet nothings to each other\u2026 Ahem, the scenery is so nice as well, you guys enjoy, take your time, I\u2019ll be leaving\u2026\u201d </p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, no trace of her crooked back could be seen at all as she moved nimbly to escape.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu instantly moved to block her with a very bright smile. \u201cBaili Yunling, why don\u2019t you explain clearly before leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough, my dear brother, it was just a convenient measure. If I didn\u2019t do that, how could I have brought Sister-in-Law back to you unharmed?\u201d Shuyin, or rather, Baili Yunling, drew back a little as she spoke with a hint of fear in her voice.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu humphed. There was clear displeasure within his tone.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was confused and couldn\u2019t wrap her head around it. \u201cWh-what? Sh-she\u2019s Baili Yunling?\u201d \u201cYunling greets Sister-in-Law.\u201d Baili Yunling reached towards her mask and ripped it off, revealing a delicately beautiful face that was extremely similar to Baili Yu\u2019s before greeting Tang Doudou in a sweet voice.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was dumbstruck. Even though the truth was right before her eyes, she still couldn\u2019t quite believe it. After all, Baili Yunling\u2019s act was way too good, even a person as meticulous as Lan Jia failed to see through her pretense. That was enough to show that she had acted exactly like Shuyin.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy, Sister-in-Law is lost in thought again, what cute!\u201d Baili Yunling laughed delicately at Tang Doudou\u2019s reaction as she remarked this teasingly.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou snapped back to reality upon hearing her bell-like laughter. Baili Yunling had remarked this back in the stone room as well. She had found her slightly mischievous manner strange at the time, but it all made sense now. It turned out that she was a lovable young girl from the start. Baili Yu\u2019s little sister ought to be someone this lively and lovable, someone with a personality like Nangong Yan was simply too unbearable.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou just didn\u2019t know when Baili Yu had found this sister of his, and how had she ended up coincidentally being in the stone room to rescue her?</p><br/><p>Baili Yunling could see the puzzlement on Tang Doudou\u2019s face so she said with a smile, \u201cSister-in-Law, do you happen to remember the scent of the incense in the stone room?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything snapped into place. \u201cYou were the one who lit that incense?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

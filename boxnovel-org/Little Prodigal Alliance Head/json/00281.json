That place was so far away from the Sacred Tree and also wasn\u2019t someplace that she could casually enter. There were definitely a lot of experts from the Seven Great Saint Tribes there. If she went alone, she\u2019d probably be \u2018kacha\u2019-ed by someone before she even manages to make a splash, much less reach Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>After thinking it over for awhile, Tang Doudou\u2019s gaze landed on Lan Jia. There was a grand wedding waiting for him to attend, yet he ran all the way here to tell her these things. Who would be dumb enough to believe that he didn\u2019t have a motive?</p><br/><p>As expected, Lan Jia smiled and opened his eyes. \u201cLady Doudou, you\u2019ve really asked the right person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou responded with a smile.\u201cSaint Envoy Lan Jia, let\u2019s not beat around the bush. Just say it, what exactly do I have to do so that you\u2019ll take me to the Saint Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Doudou sure is very straightforward. Now I feel bad about requesting this\u2026\u201d said Lan Jia. </p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently roasted him in her heart. If he knew how to feel bad, then there wouldn\u2019t exist any more thick-skinned people in this world. She put on an unperturbed expression and said, \u201cSaint Envoy Lan Jian, there\u2019s no harm, so feel free to say it. I won\u2019t mock you for being shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia\u2019s expression stiffened. There were a lot of people that called him shameless, but no one has ever dared to say that to his face before. He had also never seen such a subtle way of bad-mouthing someone either.</p><br/><p>However, he was still an old fox after all. In the blink of an eye, he was all smiles again. \u201cI will be straightforward with you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d Tang Doudou suddenly felt that the \u2018en\u2019 word Mu Ye always used was actually really useful. </p><br/><p>Lan Jia continued, \u201cThe Saint Palace only admits those ranked as Saint Envoys or higher. If an outsider or a Saint Apprentice wants to get in, then there\u2019s only one method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat method?\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s Brother Baili\u2019s method. This method\u2019s indeed superb, you can enter the Saint Palace and also bring a beauty home; it kills two birds with one stone perfectly,\u201d answered Lan Jia as he smiled like an old fox. It really made people want to beat him up.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou understood his words, but where was she supposed to find a Saint Emperor\u2019s token?</p><br/><p>Lan Jia saw the realization in her eyes and praised, \u201cLooks like Lady has already guessed the idea, you\u2019re indeed exceptionally intelligent.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, if he found out that Tang Doudou had actually completely misinterpreted the main point, he\u2019d probably get so angry he\u2019d beat this dumb girl to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis method is good, but it\u2019s just too difficult.\u201d Tang Doudou frowned and propped up her chin, vexed.</p><br/><p>What was so hard about acting as his bride?</p><br/><p>Lan Jia thought that she was hesitating due to lingering emotions and so he said, \u201cAlthough this one has some feelings towards Lady, this one also understands the principle that \u2018one shouldn\u2019t covet one\u2019s friend\u2019s wife.\u2019 Therefore, Lady Doudou can rest assured. My only intention is to help Lady find Brother Baili. I won\u2019t ask Lady to become my wife for real.\u201d </p><br/><p>After that, he added, \u201cThis one never insists on things that can\u2019t be forced.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Tang Doudou glanced at him, and then took a second glance with an odd expression on her face.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia couldn\u2019t take it anymore and touched his cheek which was currently covered by the black robe. \u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? How come this one doesn\u2019t feel anything?\u201d Lan Jia\u2019s fingertips then slid through the black robe as if he was about to expose his face. </p><br/><p>Tang Doudou chuckled. A trace of craftiness flashed through her eyes as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a thick layer of intangible skin, so of course you can\u2019t feel it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, Lan Jia stopped rubbing and he narrowed his eyes slightly. \u201cLady Doudou\u2026\u201d </p><br/><p>Tang Doudou interrupted him and said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble Saint Envoy Lan Jia with the arrangements then.\u201d Following that, she started walking towards the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to let Mu Ye know and ask him to wait for me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Look for Mu Ye?</p><br/><p>But she wouldn\u2019t be able to find him anymore.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia smiled slightly, but he didn\u2019t stop Tang Doudou and just slowly closed his eyes again. He initially thought that he would have to exert extra efforts to persuade her, but she had actually agreed so quickly. He had really overestimated her.</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t it have occurred to her that if all Baili Yu wanted was to gain power, then he could have just taken over the Wind Spirit Imperial Court. Why would he bother running all the way to this remote crappy place just to become some Saint Emperor?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu, that good son of his, never liked to be controlled by others. If he wanted to be the Saint Emperor, then he would have staged everything neatly so that he could sit on his position of Saint Emperor firmly. What need would there be for him to agree to some lousy wedding?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou still didn\u2019t understand his son well enough ah, it seemed!</p><br/><p>When Lan Jia\u2019s thoughts reached this point, he got up and left the five words \u2018wait for the right time\u2019 on the table.</p><br/><p>Following that, he jumped out the window gracefully. His qinggong was extremely good. What a liar! Who would believe that he didn\u2019t know any martial arts!?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked but in the end, wasn\u2019t able to find Mu Ye. The Mu Ye who said just yesterday that he would follow her wherever she went, had vanished without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou assumed he left to take care of some urgent matters. In any case, she had been racking her brains on how to ask him to leave, but now there was no need to worry about this anymore. </p><br/><p>When she got back to the room, she saw the five words left on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for the right time?\u201d Tang Doudou wiped the words away with her hand and then grumbled, \u201cWait for what time? Didn\u2019t he say that Baili Yu and the Saint Maiden were getting married soon? If we wait longer, then wouldn\u2019t it be too late!?\u201d</p><br/><p>But there was also no other way, she could only put her hope in the method he had proposed. No matter how anxious she was, she had no choice but to wait patiently.</p><br/><p>Since she had nothing to do, she went out to stroll around again. She bought a new set of clothes to change into and also bought two sets for Mu Ye, but she didn\u2019t know whether the sizes would fit him. After awhile, she returned to the inn to wait for Lan Jia.</p><br/><p>As soon as she walked in, a gray figure rushed up and threw itself at her. </p><br/><p>When she got a clear look, she was stunned to find that it was Lil\u2019 Gray. She hadn\u2019t seen him since he ran away in the forest. At that time they were in the mountain cave, so that was probably why he hadn\u2019t been able to find them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Gray?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhi, zhii\u2026\u201d screeched Lil\u2019 Gray when he heard Tang Doudou\u2019s voice. After that, he jumped into her arms and buried his head into her chest with a doleful look as if he had been wronged.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lifted her hand to pull him out of her bosom and set him on her shoulder before saying, \u201cLil\u2019 Gray ah, you\u2019re finally back. What\u2019s wrong, who bullied you? Look at your pitiful manner, you\u2019re seriously hopeless.\u201d </p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray felt wronged and screeched again, \u201cZhizhizhi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone really bullied him ah!</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray point towards the inn\u2019s second floor. Tang Doudou lifted her head to look upstairs. Who else would it be except Lan Jia, that shameless scoundrel?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

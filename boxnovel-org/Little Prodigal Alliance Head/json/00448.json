When she thought about things more, she found that there were other strange points.</p><br/><p>Now that she thought about it, Baili Yu wasn\u2019t very strict towards Yiling. He only became that way with things relating to Jun Xin. Could it be that he didn\u2019t want Yiling to like Jun Xin?</p><br/><p>But how was that possible? He had just agreed to play matchmaker for the two, but his attitude had changed in the blink of an eye. This was too strange.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t figure it out no matter how she thought about it, but she couldn\u2019t let their relationship become too tense. Her eyes whirled. When her gaze swept across her stomach, she came up with an idea.</p><br/><p>After Baili Yiling had said that, she and Baili Yu sank into a long still silence. In reality, Baili Yu was scrutinizing her while she was timidly avoiding his gaze.</p><br/><p>As each of them sank into their own thoughts, suddenly Tang Doudou cried out in pain and crouched down on the ground.</p><br/><p>As of now, every movement from Tang Doudou would make Baili Yu\u2019s heart tremble. When he heard her cry out in pain, he turned around worriedly and asked, \u201cDoudou, what\u2019s wrong? Are you not feeling well? Is it your stomach or where?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he turned to the maid that had been acting as a tree stump for a good while and shouted, \u201cWhat are you still standing there for? Hurry and find a doctor for the madame!\u201d</p><br/><p>The maid had never seen Baili Yu look this way and was so frightened that her back was covered with cold sweat. She didn\u2019t dare to waste time and hastily went to look for a doctor.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling was also alarmed and hastily went over to help Tang Doudou up. When she saw that Tang Doudou was holding her stomach, she reached over to check her pulse.</p><br/><p>However Tang Doudou smoothly dodged and leaned towards Baili Yu with an expression of pain. \u201cMy stomach, my stomach\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your stomach?\u201d Baili Yu hugged her. He wanted to lift her up, but he was worried that if he moved her, it would cause her to be in more pain, so he could only squeeze her hand to comfort her.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou sensed how nervous and worried he was, she felt bad. Her eyes whirled and she said, \u201cMy stomach, my stomach\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just that the baby kicked me a little hard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she had expected, Baili Yu wasn\u2019t as nervous when he heard that it was because the baby kicked her. He lifted Tang Doudou back into the pavilion and stroked her belly softly with his slender fingers. His tone was completely different from how he faced Baili Yiling as he said, \u201cBaby, be good alright? Don\u2019t kick Mother anymore, alright? Once you come out, you can just kick Dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, his voice was so gentle that it felt like a gentle brook\u2019s trickling in spring. Tang Doudou looked down and saw that his eyes were lowered. The light within his eyes was radiant and curtained by his long eyelashes. The sight of those beautiful eyes took her breath away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t say anything, that\u2019s tacit agreement. A man must keep their word, so if you kick Mother this way next time, I won\u2019t let you off!\u201d However, Baili Yu\u2019s next words made her forehead fill with black lines. Fudge, he was seriously too shameless!</p><br/><p>First he was saying that silence was tacit agreement, then he was saying that a man must keep their word. When had any words been spoken?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou really wanted to retort for her child, but when she saw how earnest Baili Yu was and recalled that she had just tricked him, she couldn\u2019t help but feel apologetic so she let this slide.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling just happened to hear what he said as she walked in and burst out laughing as well. At the same time, she felt wronged. Why was Big Brother so gentle to Sister-in-Law and her little nephew, but so strict towards her?</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou looked away from Baili Yu, it was just in time to catch that trace of sadness on Baili Yiling\u2019s face. She shot a wink towards Baili Yiling and indicated for her to hurry and come up with an excuse to leave.</p><br/><p>However, Baili Yiling didn\u2019t catch what she meant at first and open her eyes wide in confusion as she shook her head.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was anxious but she couldn\u2019t mouth the words. When she saw that Baili Yu was about to get up, she was worried that he would scold Baili Yiling again and hastily cried out, \u201cHe kicked again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s hand which was still on her belly stiffened for a moment, then he asked in a tone of mixed worry and excitement, \u201cWhere? Does it still hurt? Why is he moving so much? Could it be that he doesn\u2019t feel well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou stroked her stomach in confusion. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt this time, it was really light. It only felt like an itch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s probably fine. Why is the doctor still not here?\u201d Tang Doudou glanced outside anxiously, then her gaze landed on Baili Yiling. \u201cYiling, can you help me see where the doctor is? I\u2019m a little worried. The baby has moved so many times today.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she sent Baili Yiling a meaningful look and Baili Yiling finally caught the meaning this time. \u201cOh! Alright, I\u2019ll go now!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she didn\u2019t bother to look to Baili Yu for confirmation and ran in the direction the maid had left in earlier.</p><br/><p>Once Baili Yiling was gone from sight, Tang Doudou sighed in relief and finally looked away, only to find that Baili Yu was currently looking at her with a seemingly smiling expression. His hand stroked her belly from time to time, but it wasn\u2019t as careful as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, he kicked me again!\u201d Her hair was rising on end from how Baili Yu was staring at her, so she had no choice but to take out this trump card in hopes that he would stop smiling so scarily.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Baili Yu chuckled. \u201cBut I asked the baby earlier and he said that he had been sleeping this entire time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pouted. \u201cWith how little he is, how could he know how to speak?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe connection between a father and son. He told me with his heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConnection between a father and a daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked speechlessly towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu chuckled again. \u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t know about those little thoughts of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine fine, you\u2019re the smartest in the whole world, happy?\u201d Tang Doudou puffed up her cheeks angrily. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it. Why are you so strict towards Yiling? Although she\u2019s your younger sister, she\u2019s already an adult. She has her own thoughts, judgement, and right to choose. Even though you\u2019re her older brother, you can\u2019t get involved in her choice!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that she had been worried about this.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu sighed. \u201cDoudou, I\u2019m doing this for her own good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, but have you ever thought about the fact that it\u2019s possible to do wrong even with good intentions?\u201d Tang Doudou spoke to Baili Yu sincerely as she tried to reform his views.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was very intelligent, but he was still someone of the ancient era. How could his thoughts possibly be as modern as hers?</p><br/><p>She could tell from his words that he liked sons!</p><br/><p>Dumb humans!</p><br/><p>Humph!</p><br/><p>Baili Yu frowned. \u201cDo wrong? How are you so sure it\u2019s a wrong and not a right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that you\u2019ve never heard of the saying that it\u2019s better to tear down a temple than it is to destroy a marriage? Let the youngsters deal with their own problems. As for us! We shouldn\u2019t meddle!\u201d Her tone was so wise that there was almost the illusion of a beard.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the one that told me to play matchmaker for them. Now you\u2019re saying not to meddle?\u201d Baili Yu gave an unreadable smile.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s stern expression immediately collapsed and she fell with a howl into Baili Yu\u2019s arms. \u201cCan we even be friends anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good. I understand everything that you\u2019ve said, but if Yiling wants to get together with Jun Xin, it\u2019d be difficult without our interference.\u201d Baili Yu glanced down at her peeved expression and his heart softened. He pulled her into his arms. \u201cYou know Jun Xin\u2019s temper as well. The more you tell him to do something, the more he refuses. If we go with force, he might be scared right off. We have to do this slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for Yiling, if we\u2019re not stricter with her, based on how intense her personality is, she definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to suppress her feelings. I\u2019m worried that she\u2019ll do something terrible for the sake of love. If my guess isn\u2019t wrong, she probably came this time to ask me for permission to go with Master on this trip.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, that place isn\u2019t a place that anyone can go to. Based on her physique, if she went there, that\u2019d be the same as seeking death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that severe?\u201d Tang Doudou was astonished. She then rebuked herself for being so rash and not investigating things thoroughly. She knew that Baili Yu wasn\u2019t the type of person to do things without reason, but she still\u2026</p><br/><p>Baili Yu patted her head and said with a smile, \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. The reason she came here was definitely because Master had directed her to do so. He probably wants her to go. With Master looking after her on the way, there\u2019s no need to be too worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou heard this, she had to admit her respect. \u201cBut then why did you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly, if I didn\u2019t obstruct her a little, her tail would probably lift all the way up to the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>The only way Tang Doudou could express her admiration now was to prostrate herself. She stretched, then said, \u201cAlright, so I had been meddling for nothing. It\u2019s already late, so let\u2019s have dinner and rest up to send Jun Xin off tomorrow! After that, we still have to visit the martial arts alliance. I still don\u2019t know what the situation is like over there right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNews came earlier. There weren\u2019t too many casualties. The doctors we sent over have already treated all the injured. Elder Yu also sent a message.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d This peaked Tang Doudou\u2019s interest. What message would Elder Yu send her?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that he\u2019s willing to submit and that he\u2019ll never harbor disloyalty again, so he hopes that you will disregard former enmities.\u201d As Baili Yu said this, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cWife, say, what exactly does Elder Yu mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was dumbfounded. Elder Yu was willing to submit to her? Why did it sound so unrealistic?</p><br/><p>As for what exactly Elder Yu meant, Tang Doudou expressed that she really wanted to know too!</p><br/><p>The fudge? It couldn\u2019t be that he felt like the current situation was already beyond salvation, so he wanted to hide behind her?</p><br/><p>When this thought occurred to her and she thought about it more, she felt that it was actually quite possible. This guy was known to be extremely shrewd. It was hard for her not to be suspicious when he sent such a message in this sort of situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares what he means? We\u2019ll know once we take a look tomorrow!\u201d In the end, Tang Doudou gave up on worrying about it. The hardest thing to understand was a human heart. It was better to tell her to eat five pounds of durian than to tell her to try to figure out what a person was thinking.</p><br/><p>When this thought occurred to her, she started to drool. She didn\u2019t know if there was durian in this ancient era, but the more she thought about it, the stronger her craving became.</p><br/><p>A lot and a lot of tasty images seemed to float past her eyes, then her gaze slowly drifted to Baili Yu. This guy possessed remarkable abilities and the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce specialized in doing business, so he should be able to get some rare fruits, right?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

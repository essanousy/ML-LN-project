What exactly is going on with Yun Hai? And that Flowing Clouds Palace, Gu Xun\u2026 The more I think about these things, the more confused I get.\u201d She looked up at the moon as she told Baili Yu about encountering the Xiao family brothers. \u201cWas that Xiao Siyuan telling the truth? Is the Xiao family trustworthy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu understood that she was purposefully coming up with topics to talk about, so he followed along and answered, \u201cJun Xin\u2019s at the Chamber of Commerce so it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the last time I went back, Jun Xin seemed to be in a tight spot. Can he really handle it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Hai won\u2019t actually try to destroy the Chamber of Commerce for real. He just wants to borrow some things.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou heard this, she realized that the situation was even more complicated than she had thought. She had heard that Blood Fiend Jun Xin, Godspeed Yun Hai, and Demon Blade Feng Long were Baili Yu\u2019s subordinates. However, from the looks of it now, it was more than that, Jun Xin was Baili Yu\u2019s junior brother. Feng Long was the most mysterious. Tang Doudou didn\u2019t have a good impression of those strange eyes. As for Yun Hai, she had seen him a couple times and he definitely didn\u2019t seem to be simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Hai had come to look for me seven years ago of his own initiative. Back then, my Disseminating Tassel Fragrance had flared up, but I needed Phoenix Blood Herb to treat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe brought you Phoenix Blood Herb?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn. He only had one request, which was to join the Chamber of Commerce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhoenix Blood Herb is really hard to get, right?\u201d The Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce had already become famous seven years ago and had amassed quite a lot of influence and wealth. The fact that Yun Hai had been able to get something that even the Chamber of Commerce hadn\u2019t been able to get, and that he only wanted to join the Chamber of Commerce in exchange was definitely strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the Phoenix Blood Herb isn\u2019t that precious of an ingredient, it\u2019s very hard to obtain because the place where it grows is very precarious. Normal people have no way of getting to such places. However, Yun Hai just happened to know the Art of Clouds Stride, so it wasn\u2019t difficult for him to get Phoenix Blood Herb.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was like this. Tang Doudou nodded. \u201cThen why did he insist on joining the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce? Could it have been for this? He had planned this from the start seven years ago? Wow, isn\u2019t he a little too good at scheming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Hai is different from Jun Xin and Feng Long, he\u2019s very shrewd. However, he had helped me a lot after joining the Chamber of Commerce. In the past, Jun Xin would never deal with the matters and Feng Long was in charge of things unrelated to the Chamber of Commerce, so these past seven years, it was Yun Hai that had helped me manage the Chamber of Commerce. About five months ago, last year, he said that he wanted to investigate the Saint Tribes. In the end, once he set off, there was no more news from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t really get it.\u201d Tang Doudou scratched her head. From what Baili Yu said, it sounded like Yun Hai had been planning something from the start. However, Baili Yu wasn\u2019t the type that couldn\u2019t read a person, so there was no way that he hadn\u2019t noticed this?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s normal. After all, I\u2019m still confused as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d It\u2019s normal that she didn\u2019t get it, but how come Baili Yu also didn\u2019t get it?</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Hai isn\u2019t simple. Although I\u2019ve always been slightly suspicious of him, I was never able to figure out what exactly he wanted to do. Later on, some small problems surfaced, so if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Feng Long told me he went missing, I wouldn\u2019t have known that he had disappeared for so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe went missing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that he had been kidnapped by the people of the Saint Tribes. Unexpectedly, he suddenly returned again like this.\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s tone changed slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s only now that I finally understand what he wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does he want?\u201d asked Tang Doudou reflexively.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced towards her. \u201cThe world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Hai actually had that big of an ambition?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou licked her lips. \u201cHe, on his own, wants to obtain the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very skilled with schemes. Not only did he secretly instigate internal strife among the Seven Great Saint Tribes, he had polarized the opinions between Cloud City and the Martial Arts Alliance. He had managed to do all of this right behind my back.\u201d Baili Yu laughed. \u201cJust based on this, it\u2019s enough to say that he\u2019s much more amazing than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou refused to accept it and puffed up her cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s because you had weak health!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had heard from Ye Chuan that because Baili Yu\u2019s health wasn\u2019t good, he spent most of his time sleeping and didn\u2019t have much time to deal with work matters. Most of the time, it was his subordinates that carried out the necessary tasks. Baili Yu was only responsible for making the correct decisions.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled as he rubbed her head. \u201cI was a step short. There\u2019s no need to find excuses on my behalf.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been able to hide his true intentions while being in the Chamber of Commerce for seven years. Just this patience was something that no ordinary person would be able to match. Yun Hai was truly the strongest opponent he had ever encountered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s stop talking about these unhappy topics!\u201d No woman liked it when their man lost to another man, and Tang Doudou was the same. In addition, she found Yun Hai disgusting since he hadn\u2019t even shown himself and was stirring up so much strife from the shadows. He actually wanted to take over the world by manipulating things from the shadows? Tang Doudou hated people who schemed like rats.</p><br/><p>She preferred people like Baili Yu who were unbridled and domineering more. At the very least, they didn\u2019t try to shadily hide their actions.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu pushed open the door to the room and set Tang Doudou down before lying down next to her. As he patted her head, he said, \u201cGo to sleep, we\u2019re heading out to play tomorrow, so you\u2019ll need to rest well. Don\u2019t end up falling asleep while walking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was very sleepy. She had already started nodded off outside, but she forced herself to stay alert and blinked her eyes with a crafty smile. \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t fall asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fall asleep?\u201d Baili Yu received the message and smiled as he leaned over her and gently kissed her cheek. \u201cWife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei pei! This wasn\u2019t what she meant, alright?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou reached out to stop Baili Yu with an awkward expression. She licked her lips, then explained, \u201cI-I want to hear a lullaby.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

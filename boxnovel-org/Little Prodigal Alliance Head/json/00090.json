His clear pupils were filled with restrained fear.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this the foolish little kid she encountered in the Bai Residence?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d Tang Doudou was stunned for a moment before she started looking around. Could it be that after half the day, they still hadn\u2019t left the Bai Residence?</p><br/><p>Yuner seemed to recognize Tang Doudou and exposed an excited smile. \u201cBe-beautiful Big Brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at her chest. Da fudge, what part of her seems like a big brother?</p><br/><p>However, she couldn\u2019t be bothered to care much about this for now. She lifted her hand and asked Yuner, \u201cCan you help out with something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful Big Brother, what is it!?\u201d Yuner was no longer afraid when he realized it was someone he knew. He hopped off the bed and walked to Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan Yuner help Big Brother carry him onto the bed?\u201d This child seemed a little slow in his reactions, but basic communications weren\u2019t a problem. She didn\u2019t know where this place was, so she could only work on saving Baili Yu first.</p><br/><p>Although Baili Yu\u2019s body temperature was still dropping and his breathing was weak to the point of being almost imperceptible, his heart was still pounding strongly. This was what allowed Tang Doudou to calm down a little. She had heard Bai Feiyun say earlier that Baili Yu had an illness and by the sound of it, it was quite a serious illness. She didn\u2019t find any injuries on Baili Yu when she examined him earlier so this abnormal situation was probably his illness acting up!</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t a doctor so she definitely didn\u2019t have any methods to treat Baili Yu. Thus, she could only find a place for Baili Yu to rest before she headed back to the Plum Garden to get help.</p><br/><p>Yuner swept a glance at Baili Yu who was sprawled on the ground and a stunned expression flashed through his eyes. He gave a heartfelt sigh. \u201cThis Big Sister is even prettier than Big Sister San Yu\u2026\u201dE/C</p><br/><p>Wat\u2019s dat?</p><br/><p>Could it be that this child still doesn\u2019t know how to distinguish gender properly?</p><br/><p>But, he knows San Yu? From his tone, he seems to depend on her quite a bit. Looks like they were actually quite familiar.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Yuner had to work together in order to move Baili Yu onto the bed. Unexpectedly, Baili Yu, who looked pretty skinny, was actually this heavy. By the time they finished carrying him over, they were both covered with sweat. As Tang Doudou sat with Yuner, she asked, \u201cYuner, are you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot tired, Yuner\u2019s not tired.\u201d Yuner beamed as he gazed at Tang Doudou. \u201cBeautiful Big Brother, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>When this was brought up, Tang Doudou suddenly recalled something. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Yuner, is this still the Bai Residence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ah, this is Beautiful Big Sister\u2019s house.\u201d Yuner blinked innocently. \u201cBeautiful Big Brother, what are you asking this for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful Big Sister?\u201d Tang Doudou swept a glance at Baili Yu. \u201cAre you talking about San Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s Big Sister San Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you on really good terms with her?\u201d She wanted to have Yuner help guard Baili Yu so it was better to know more. That way, she could feel more at ease when she left.</p><br/><p>Yuner nodded. \u201cBig Sister San Yu is Yuner\u2019s bestest friend!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful Big Brother, do you have something you want Yuner to help with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ugh, this child is so, sooo cute\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Tang Doudou asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Yuner had on a expression of \u2018Big Brother, you\u2019re really dumb ah\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s hanging all over your face. Yuner can tell with one glance ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoyo, and she was saying this child was dumb. How was this child dumb at all?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou scratched her head. \u201cThen do you know what I want you to help with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful Big Brother wants Yuner to look after Beautiful Big Sister, right?\u201d Yuner\u2019s tone which was as innocent as before stunned Tang Doudou. It was very obvious to see that she needed help but being able to tell what she needed help with wasn\u2019t easy at all. He was actually able to tell exactly what she wanted, this was way too unexpected!</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang Doudou stare blankly, Yuner scratched the back of his head, a little embarrassed. \u201cBeautiful Big Brother doesn\u2019t need to feel curious. Yuner is stupid but can guess the thoughts of others really accurately\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was precisely because of this that he was disliked by Mother, Daddy and the others. They say that he doesn\u2019t know how to conduct himself in society and didn\u2019t understand rules.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said so? How is Yuner dumb at all?\u201d Tang Doudou patted his shoulder. \u201cYuner is capable of understanding people\u2019s hearts. This is something that most people can\u2019t even do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful Big Sister had said that before too!\u201d When Yuner heard this, his completely pure eyes lit up and he looked with pleasant surprise towards Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin and became rather curious about San Yu. What kind of person is that young girl?</p><br/><p>She had insisted on winning that cooking competition; what did she want to obtain that promise from the Prime Minister for?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou originally wanted to ask Yuner, but she saw that Baili Yu\u2019s condition seemed severe and was worried that it would get worse. Hence, she stood up. \u201cYuner, I\u2019m going to find someone to save him. I\u2019ll have to trouble you to help me look after him for a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yuner exposed a troubled expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe roof here is broken. After Big Sister San Yu returns, she\u2019ll definitely come here to investigate. If she sees this Big Sister on the bed, she\u2019ll definitely get angry. Big Sister San Yu doesn\u2019t like strangers coming into her home. So\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore Big Sister San Yu comes back, Yuner will help Big Brother carry her somewhere else!\u201d Yuner looked hopefully towards Tang Doudou, hoping that she would accept his idea.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou also really wanted to accept. However, she hesitated, thinking about Baili Yu\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>While she was hesitating, the sound of a door being opened came from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cCreak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner, are you inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was San Yu\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Yuner shared a glance. Yuner immediately became flustered and his eyes were completely at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go outside and talk to Big Sister San Yu!\u201d He gritted his teeth and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t!\u201d Tang Doudou hastily stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s better if I go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI met her earlier in the Bai Residence, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pressed down on his shoulder. \u201cYuner, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to look after him, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, alright\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuner nodded. \u201cThen, when you head out, don\u2019t start arguing with Big Sister San Yu no matter what, alright? In reality, Big Sister San Yu is really good at heart. She just doesn\u2019t like interacting with strangers. You have to talk to her properly. She\u2019ll definitely agree,\u201d said Yuner sincerely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner, are you inside? What happened to the roof\u2026\u201d San Yu walked into the courtyard from the entrance, before walking from the courtyard towards this direction probably because she had noticed the collapsed roof. When she didn\u2019t hear Yuner\u2019s reply after a long time, she thought something had happened to Yuner and immediately started running.</p><br/><p>She reached the room in a few steps. Just as she was about to push open the door and enter, the door opened from the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

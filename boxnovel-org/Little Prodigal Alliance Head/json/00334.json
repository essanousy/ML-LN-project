When she saw the darkness all around them, she fell speechless. \u201cI told you to hurry, didn\u2019t I? Now this is just great, what are we supposed to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced towards her hesitantly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just rest here until the sun rises?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glowered at him. \u201cWhat other idea is there? Seriously, you prepared everything, but why did you forget something as important as a rolled torch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, based on my predictions, we should\u2019ve been able to reach the city before nightfall.\u201d Baili Yu looked up at the sky. It really didn\u2019t feel nice to have things fall outside of his expectations.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, Tang Doudou wanted to cry but had no tears. What could she say about this?</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, hopefully we won\u2019t encounter some wild wolf or anything. Let\u2019s sleep!\u201d After saying that, Tang Doudou went back inside to sleep.</p><br/><p>After a short while, Baili Yu entered the carriage as well. Tang Doudou thought that he was going to sleep as well, so she shifted over a little. However, she was still peeved with him so she didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu sat down next to her. It was dark outside, but it was even darker inside the carriage. It was so dark that not even a finger held right up to the eye could be seen.</p><br/><p>However, Baili Yu seemed to have night vision and calmly took Tang Doudou\u2019s hand to rub and squeeze it. \u201cWife, don\u2019t be angry anymore, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gave a humph without speaking.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu turned around and his warm breath hit Tang Doudou\u2019s face. \u201cDoudou, I was wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong? What did you do wrong?\u201d She couldn\u2019t take the feeling of that warm breath anymore and sat up as she spoke in an annoyed tone.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu moved closer. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have kept flirting with Wife to the point I forgot about driving the carriage, causing us to have to wait through the night by the side of the road. It\u2019s unsafe and also uncomfortable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Baili Yu was puzzled. What else?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou puffed up her cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s right, and!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu wasn\u2019t as dumb as to ask what else was there. He understood that if he asked, it would not end well.</p><br/><p>So he squeezed Tang Doudou\u2019s hand again. The soft plump feeling made his mood lift, and as soon as his mood lifted, his head also started working a lot better.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, I know that a hundred wrongs or a thousand wrongs, it\u2019s all my fault. I\u2019ll admit to it and never do it again, alright? Just forgive me this once, alright? I promise that there will never be a next time!\u201d As he spoke, he made a serious expression. However, then he recalled that it was too dark for Tang Doudou to see his expression, so he relaxed and tugged on Tang Doudou\u2019s sleeve. \u201cWife\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be angry anymore, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, then why don\u2019t you just hit me?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re angry, just vent your anger on me. I guarantee that I won\u2019t fight back!</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, you should just vent all the darkness in your heart on me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu seemed to have instantly transformed into a seventy-year-old granny. He was chattering nonstop, so much that Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t even edge a word in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright! I\u2019m not angry anymore.\u201d So it turned out that it could be this scary when a man started acting coquettishly! Tang Doudou conceded her defeat.</p><br/><p>When Baili Yu heard that, his hand that had been itching to move started traveling restlessly.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou grabbed his misbehaving hand and said, \u201cBehave! Sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, I want to hug you while sleeping. I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wanted to cry but didn\u2019t have the tears. She was also afraid ah! Afraid that this guy was going to transform into a wolf. She had no desire to play such an exciting game in the wilderness!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem! A man and a woman alone together should maintain some distance,\u201d said Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, right after she said this, the hand that was tightly hugging her pulled back. There was an unusually loud sound of someone turning, then Baili Yu\u2019s presence moved away. He seemed to now be hiding in a corner.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was confused. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu replied sulkily, \u201cWife said to maintain distance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to get that far away!\u201d Tang Doudou was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou also felt uncomfortable when Baili Yu was far away. When she saw that he didn\u2019t have any intention to move back here, she said, \u201cWhat are you still doing there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife said to maintain distance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI said there\u2019s no need to maintain that much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018oh\u2019!?\u201d Tang Doudou got up. This guy was seriously being too much, she had to teach him a lesson today!</p><br/><p>When Baili Yu sensed Tang Doudou getting up, he hastily got up as well.</p><br/><p>Although the carriage was small, since Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t see anything, she didn\u2019t dare to just walk over. Instead, she kept her hands on both walls of the carriage as she slowly moved over. However, when she reached out, she didn\u2019t feel anything. Where was he?</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>No one replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig evil spirit? Baili Yu? Say something!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you, if you don\u2019t hurry and say something, I won\u2019t ever talk to you again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m over here.\u201d Perhaps the last sentence scared Baili Yu because he replied to her timidly.</p><br/><p>He had actually run behind her back again.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was ticked off. Was he trying to play hide-and-seek with her!?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to move, I\u2019m going over to find you!\u201d commanded Tang Doudou. Then she turned around to head over. However, as soon as she took a step, her foot got caught on something and she fell forward.</p><br/><p>The carriage was only so large, so she fell right into Baili Yu\u2019s arms.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Scoundrel!</p><br/><p>\u201cSyndicate Leader Liu, do you have a complaint against me ah?\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t have the time to trade ink splashes with him. Bai Feiyun was still waiting for her rescue!</p><br/><p>Syndicate Leader Liu had a gaunt face with beady eyes, an appearance that was obviously wretched. Upon hearing this, his mung bean eyes(in reference to size, very small eyes) became malign and he was just about to throw a retort at Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>But how could Tang Doudou let him continue to beep*</p><br/><p> \u2013 \u201cbeep\u201d(italicized) Chinese phonetic words that are almost pronounced like the letter \u2018b\u2019. Pinyin is bi4bi4. It\u2019s pretty much the sound \u2018beep\u2019 in English for censored swear words.</p><br/><p>She took the initiative to cut off his words, \u201cEven if you have a complaint, don\u2019t come looking for me. Don\u2019t think that I cherish this Alliance Head position! If you feel like you, yourself, have the ability to sit in this seat and manage to obtain the permission of the City Lord da ren, then I, Li Xueyi, will immediately yield this Alliance Head position to you without another word!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Xueyi, you! You\u2019re simply impervious to reason!\u201d Syndicate Leader Liu could not accept this. He was of Elder Yu\u2019s faction and just couldn\u2019t approve of this Li Xueyi, but he also didn\u2019t harbor any desires to be some Alliance Head ah. If he had this kind of sneaky little desire, Elder Yu would have long since sorted him out. Else, how could he have still been treated with so much trust to the point that Elder Yu entrusted him with the task of delaying Li Xueyi and preventing him from saving Bai Feiyun?</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d After facing a berate, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t feel like wasting any more words on him. Pulling Qing Yin over, she asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s your master right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>She must go find Baili Yu. She not only wanted to ask him for the Alliance Head Command Tablet, but also wanted to ask him to help save Bai Feiyun!</p><br/><p>Qing Yin had already received Baili Yu\u2019s instructions. Upon hearing this, her brows lowered, \u201cLi gongzi, Master had headed out early this morning to Huai River to see the colored lanterns.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the damned bright and early morning, what yarn of lanterns are there to look at!? You\u2019re lying to xiao ye?\u201d Seeing the way Qing Yin\u2019s brows were slightly furrowed, Tang Doudou immediately knew she was lying. Sweeping another glance over the people that were waiting anxiously while looking at her, she said: \u201cYou guys return first. I\u2019ll head back after I get the Alliance Head Command Tablet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the firm tone in her voice, everyone nodded. It was still best not to stay too long in this kind of place.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Alliance Head has already spoken, everyone should disperse. Have faith that Alliance Head will rescue Bai gongzi with all due haste!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll simply have to trouble Alliance Head to work hard. This one will take his leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, we\u2019ll take our leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the people rush to leave one after another eagerly, clearly not wanting to stay here for even a second longer, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Da hell, couldn\u2019t a couple of you stay behind to help her out!?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like she knew martial arts! Even if she got the Alliance Head Command Tablet she still wouldn\u2019t be able to rescue Bai Feiyun out of the hands of these martial arts experts ah! The even more crucial question was, what if that dark cold-faced Mu Ye was also there?</p><br/><p>If she fell into his hands, the aftermath was simply too horrible to imagine!</p><br/><p>But right now she couldn\u2019t open her mouth to tell them to stay. If it was found out that she had lost her martial arts, she can\u2019t even imagine what worse kinds of imaginary moths they\u2019d manage to dust out(create problems out of little things/nothing).</p><br/><p>She\u2019ll just have to ask Baili Yu for help when she sees him. But, would he help?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou became extremely depressed. Just as she was about to pull Qing Yin off to find Baili Yu, her eyes swept over and discovered that Syndicate Leader Liu was actually still sitting there without showing the slightest indication of leaving.</p><br/><p>Her brows knitted with suspicions, could it be that this guy still had secret motives?</p><br/><p>Syndicate Leader Liu seemed to have felt her suspecting gaze. He turned his head towards her as he smiled coldly, \u201cFor the sake of preventing Alliance Head from forgetting this matter, this subordinate will keep watch here in order to remind Alliance Head at all times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Remind? As if! You magpie-like chatterbox!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you can just wait here!\u201d Tang Doudou had to silently curse in her heart before she could bring herself to humph a disdainful reply.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, she didn\u2019t pay anymore attention to Syndicate Leader Liu and pulled Qing Yin to the corner to ask quietly: \u201cTell me the truth, is Baili Yu still in the garden? He didn\u2019t go to some Huai River to see colored lanterns, did he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi is truly wise and perceptive.\u201d Qing Yin\u2019s brows furrowed even more. It took quite a pause before she was about to spit out such a sentence.</p><br/><p>Meow a mii, seriously! Baili Yu definitely knew about this group\u2019s motives. He might even be making tea right now, waiting for her to head over.</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it made her balls hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin, bring me over!\u201d If she didn\u2019t go, she wouldn\u2019t be able to save Bai Feiyun, not to mention she also has to look for Baili Yu for the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s seriously such a painful matter.</p><br/><p>This time, Qing Yin actually replied quite refreshingly, \u201cAlright, this servant will lead gongzi there right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, let\u2019s go,\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou and Qing Yin walked out of the Guest Hall, one following the other. But unexpectedly, Syndicate Leader Liu also followed them out.</p><br/><p>This time, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t just let it go. You f-ing said that you\u2019d be staying here and waiting, what are you following me for?</p><br/><p>Surveillance? Isn\u2019t his sense of duty a little too strong!?</p><br/><p>But Tang Doudou didn\u2019t speak right on the spot and continued to walk unruffled. As expected, after just a few steps, Qing Yin who was behind her stopped and spoke with unusual coldness to Syndicate Leader Liu: \u201cSyndicate Leader Liu, please stay your steps. Master does not like having other people casually stroll around the garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Qing Yin, I\u2019m not casually strolling at all. Aren\u2019t I following my family\u2019s Alliance Head?\u201d Syndicate Leader Liu\u2019s orders were to keep close to Tang Doudou. Even though Tang Doudou\u2019s attitude towards him was not good at all, for good or bad he was still someone from Alliance Head Residence. If he really was scolded to stop by Baili Yu\u2019s maid, Tang Doudou, as the Alliance Head, would also lose face.</p><br/><p>In any case, Elder Yu only gave one command. No matter what, don\u2019t let Li Xueyi have an easy time!</p><br/><p>If it was someone else, perhaps this little scheme of his would have worked. But unfortunately, Tang Doudou had always snorted disdainfully at the idea of reputation. At this moment, she only felt that Baili Yu was still pretty useful; Qing Yin was nothing more than a maid of his, yet even this kind of conceited person would still be polite and try to avoid offending her.</p><br/><p>The corners of Qing Yin\u2019s eyes swept across Tang Doudou\u2019s face and immediately knew what Tang Doudou was thinking. So she spoke to Syndicate Leader Liu without a shred of leniency: \u201cLi gongzi is my family\u2019s master\u2019s honored guest, no matter how he wishes to walk in the garden, it is alright. But what my family\u2019s Master hates the most is this sort of guests that turn up without being invited. Right now, Qing Yin will just offer Syndicate Leader Liu one line of advice, think well before you act!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished, she turned and left without turning back. The person had made the words very clear, if you want to follow, then just follow. If you anger Baili Yu, then deal with the consequences yourself.</p><br/><p>Syndicate Leader Liu hesitated. In the end, he gritted his teeth and called out to Tang Doudou: \u201cAlliance Head!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was seriously fed up with this guy. She snapped: \u201cSyndicate Leader Liu, it\u2019s better if you just head back. There\u2019s no use for you here!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she also followed Qing Yin and walked off.</p><br/><p>A trace of wrath flashed through Syndicate Leader Liu\u2019s mung bean eyes, but when he glanced around the courtyard, it was still with restrained fear in his eyes. In the end, he unwillingly gave up and left.</p><br/><p>As for Tang Doudou and Qing Yin who had already walked far away, they were completely unconcerned about Syndicate Leader Liu. As Tang Doudou walked, she asked: \u201cQing Yin ah, where did Jun Xin run off to lately?\u201d</p><br/><p>Setting about the goal from Jun Xin\u2019s side was much easier than directly looking for Baili Yu to try and make progress towards the goal.</p><br/><p>Even though Jun Xin\u2019s mood fluctuated a lot, it was still pretty simple. As long as she grasped the right angle, dealing with him would be much easier.</p><br/><p>But Baili Yu wasn\u2019t like that at all, he was like a thousand years old fox. However, if it was just that she wouldn\u2019t be that pressured; the most important point is that this fox\u2019s mood was also extremely complicated, completely ungraspable ah!</p><br/><p>When Qing Yin heard her ask about Jun Xin, that embarrassing image of Tang Doudou pressing down upon Jun Xin immediately appeared in her mind. A trace of unnaturalness appeared in her expression but she still replied honestly: \u201cJun Xin went out to handle some matters and still hasn\u2019t returned yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Went to handle some matters? Tang Doudou rubbed her chin, then asked: \u201cDoes your family\u2019s Master know that I\u2019m heading over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin nodded, \u201cLi gongzi, Master isn\u2019t a bad person. You don\u2019t have to be so scared of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScared?\u201d Tang Doudou laughed \u2018hehe\u2019 and wrapped her arm around Qing Yin\u2019s shoulder as her clear pupils rolled about, \u201cHow could I possibly be scared of him!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin\u2019s face froze at being suddenly hugged. She wanted to struggle free, but also coveted and yearned for that sunshine-like scent around her body. A faint trace of sorrow streaked past her beautiful pupils, \u201cGongzi, if the feelings cannot be promised, only ask for mutual kindness.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke very light and mildly, but Tang Doudou heard it loud and clear. She only felt that her brain turned into a mashed paste, this\u2026</p><br/><p>Qing Yin actually thought\u2026 she liked her?</p><br/><p>I swear a giant freak! This misunderstanding seriously got big!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin ah!\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t intend to allow the misunderstanding to continue on. She has always felt that some things ah, should be decided swiftly and firmly. If not, things would definitely become messy. She felt like kindred spirits with Qing Yin, if things continued like this and one day her identity got exposed, wouldn\u2019t that hurt Qing Yin\u2019s feelings even more?</p><br/><p>The best solution would be to take advantage of this situation where the first signs have just sprouted, and pick it by the roots as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>As for what Qing Yin would think afterwards, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dare to be sure.</p><br/><p>The thing she was most worried about was, what if she ends up telling Baili Yu about this?</p><br/><p>Thinking up to this point, Tang Doudou froze. This hadn\u2019t occurred to her earlier. Now, just how was she supposed to say it?</p><br/><p>As she was pondering, Qing Yin had already walked a distance away.</p><br/><p>For lack of a better option, she could only follow.</p><br/><p>Directly to Snow Gazing Courtyard.</p><br/><p>Jesus, Baili Yu, this guy, was actually here the whole time ah!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin as she followed Qing Yin into Snow Gazing Courtyard. Glancing towards the side with the kitchen, she then retrieved her gaze again. Last time she gave Meng Yu an idea, wonder if she used it or not? If she was about to build a good relationship with Meng Yu, in the future it would be much easier to use that kitchen.</p><br/><p>Not to mention she also coveted Meng Yu\u2019s culinary skills a lot ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi, Master is waiting for you in the pavilion building.\u201d After leading Tang Doudou to the first floor of the building, Qing Yin folded her hands and stood to the side.</p><br/><p>Seeing her calm expression below her veil, Tang Doudou sighed then entered the building alone.</p><br/><p>Upstairs was a sliding door meant to be pushed horizontally. As Tang Doudou was preoccupied with worrying over a matter, she didn\u2019t bother to knock and with one push, walked directly in.</p><br/><p>The arrangement inside was of the same style Baili Yu always had: simple yet does not lose in luxuriousness. But right now, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t have the mind to pay much attention to it as she strode in with large steps.</p><br/><p>From the side, the sound of pouring water reached her ears. It sounded like someone was bathing!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately slowed down her steps as she erected her ears as high as she could and glanced around with shifty eyes. Hell, it was still broad daylight out. Baili Yu was taking a bath right now?</p><br/><p>Really really interested ah!</p><br/><p>There were very few furnishings in the room so Tang Doudou immediately located the direction the sound of water came from. It was behind the screen in the inner room.</p><br/><p>Walking quietly on her tiptoes as she approached, through the half-transparent screen she only saw a steaming mist and a faint human figure playing with the water inside the bathtub. Just the sight of that shadow was beautiful to extremes. Recalling that exceptionally handsome face of Baili Yu, Tang Doudou excitedly licked her lips. Fudge, if she could see Baili Yu\u2013this kind of beautiful man\u2013right as he exits the bath, she\u2019d feel satisfied even if she were to die ah!</p><br/><p>Towards Baili Yu, Tang Doudou was very on guard. However, towards that charm of his, Tang Doudou more than just watered at the mouth.</p><br/><p>Downstairs, since it had already been awhile since Tang Doudou had gone up, Qing Yin was currently thinking about him. Her heart was very much depressed and she couldn\u2019t help but give a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The maid, Qing Xin, was heading over towards this direction with clean female garments in her hands. Arriving just in time to see Qing Yin sigh, she couldn\u2019t help but ask with concern: \u201cQing Yin, are you not feeling well? Lately you always seem to be dazing out?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a good sister\u2019s voice so Qing Yin immediately returned to her senses. Just as she was about to reply, her gaze slid over the clothing in Qing Xin\u2019s hands, \u201cThis is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s Miss Bai\u2019s. She said she had an exhausting journey and was embarrassed to head over to see Master like this, so she ordered for a bath to be prepared. In the end, she didn\u2019t bring clothes so she had me go out to buy an outfit. From the looks of it, it should be about time. I\u2019ll head up first to give her the clothes. I\u2019ll talk more with you when I come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she headed towards the second floor.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin\u2019s brain roared and she immediately grabbed her. Her tongue fumbled a bit as she asked, \u201cY-you\u2019re saying, that right now, in the pavilion, it\u2019s not Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat right ah, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qing Yin seriously has been strange lately, didn\u2019t Master say in the morning that he was going to Wind Building to wait for someone? How come she looks like she didn\u2019t know? Oh, that\u2019s right, didn\u2019t she go to serve that Li gongzi? Why would she be here?</p><br/><p>Seeing her blank expression, Qing Xin suddenly felt something was off.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be!</p><br/><p>Precisely at this moment, a deafening shriek came from the upper floor, \u201cAh! Scoundrel!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Suddenly, Su Yi who had disappeared reappeared from some corner. His facial color was terrible; it was unknown what he had disappeared earlier to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d asked Tang Doudou curiously the moment Su Yi sat down.</p><br/><p>Su Yi didn\u2019t make a sound and sat there gloomily, clearly very depressed. Tang Doudou asked again, \u201cWho did you encounter? Why does your facial color look so bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi sighed but still didn\u2019t speak. A while later, he asked Baili Yu, \u201cWhen are we heading back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu slanted a glance at him. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were finally leaving. Gu Xun let loose a breath of relief, then stood up in preparation to see them out.</p><br/><p>Seeing as they were about to leave, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but recall what Baili Yu had said earlier. Didn\u2019t he say that they were here to fish for information about Old Suo? How could they leave before even asking about it?</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t tell what Baili Yu was planning at all.</p><br/><p>They were almost out of the Gu Residence when Baili Yu suddenly stopped walking. As if he had suddenly recalled something, he gave a light laugh and said, \u201cI almost forgot about my main business.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Gu Xun who was behind him heard this, he stumbled and almost fell to the ground. Could it be that everything they had discussed earlier was not his main business?</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Gu, I heard that you have extensive information networks in Mist City. There is a person I wish to find, wonder if Boss Gu could help make some inquiries about the person?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Gu Xun possibly be unaware of who Baili Yu wanted to find? If Baili Yu had mentioned this earlier when they had first arrived, he would have found some excuse to tactfully decline. After all, he had already prepared for this scenario in advance.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Baili Yu didn\u2019t bring this matter up at all earlier and talked a great deal about establishing a collaboration with him, tickling him so much his heart completely itched. Who wouldn\u2019t want to earn money if the option was in front of them? Not to mention this was a business deal that didn\u2019t require him to undertake any personal risk\u2026</p><br/><p>That was why he had no way of refusing right now.</p><br/><p>If he refused and angered Baili Yu, he might not get any share of the benefits once Five Kilometers Emporium was rebuilt. At that time he\u2019d regret so much his intestines would turn green.T/N</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

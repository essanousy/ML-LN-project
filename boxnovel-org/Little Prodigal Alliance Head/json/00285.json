He said in a slightly apologetic tone, \u201cMy apologies, I seriously like my wife too much. You understand right? I just couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he apologized, anyone could see that smugness and content on his face. From the looks of it, he really did like his wife a lot.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia criticized, \u201cNo sense of shame!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! To barge into my bridal chamber in the middle of the night, you really are quite shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Lan Jia didn\u2019t have any feelings towards his son, he still became furious when his own son insulted him. \u201cYou unfilial child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely!\u201d Baili Yu grinned. No one could understand what he was thinking, to be so happy when he was being insulted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Lan Jia never thought that there existed someone with skin even thicker than his. Could this be the so-called blue, which is made from indigo but is even more vivid than indigo? When this thought occurred to him, he was amused despite his anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see if you can still remain so arrogant later!\u201d Lan Jia didn\u2019t curse at Baili Yu anymore and sat down angrily on a nearby stool. Then he glared at Shen Moru and asked, \u201cShen Moru, why is it still not here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Moru had been mulling over the relationship between the two and was jolted back to his senses when he heard Lan Jia\u2019s angry tone. \u201cSaint Emperor, I\u2019ll go look right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia waved his hand in an impatient manner. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Moru withdrew.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia was finding the couple in the room an extreme eyesore, so he stood up and said, \u201cKeep a close watch on them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Saint Emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia flung back his sleeves and strode out of the room.</p><br/><p>After he left, Baili Yu shook Tang Doudou a little, but found that she was deeply asleep. He smiled helplessly. She truly trusted him a lot.</p><br/><p>However, although his Hoarfrost Poison had been temporarily suppressed, he had used up a lot of strength to help suppress Tang Doudou\u2019s rampaging Xuanyuan blood. If he had tried to forcefully break out right now, Lan Jia would immediately notice this fact.</p><br/><p>That was why he had wasted so much time here.</p><br/><p>Even though he was afraid of that object, he had no choice but to take the risk and stay here. When he sensed that his inner strength was gradually recovering, he smiled.</p><br/><p>Lan Jia was destined to suffer a great loss this time.</p><br/><p>Right when his thoughts had gotten here, someone rushed in from outside. Without speaking, the person attacked and instantly killed all the black-robed people in the room.</p><br/><p>After he killed them, he walked to Baili Yu and swept his gaze over Tang Doudou before saying coldly, \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Leader Mu, what do you mean by this?\u201d A trace of puzzlement flashed through Baili Yu\u2019s eyes as he looked at Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s face was expressionless as he repeated, \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d replied Baili Yu. Leave obediently when told to? No way. He would only leave when he felt like leaving.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye glanced at him coldly. \u201cI\u2019ll bring her out of here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu lifted his eyes. This person actually dared to say to his face that he was going to take his wife away? If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he had saved Tang Doudou several times\u2026</p><br/><p>However, gratefulness was a separate matter. He was very petty when it came to his wife. \u201cSect Leader Mu, as of now, Doudou is my wife. It\u2019s probably not very appropriate for you to take her with you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave now, it\u2019ll be too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be.\u201d Baili Yu laughed lightly. \u201cIf Sect Leader Mu is worried, you can leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Mu Ye didn\u2019t say anymore and just left.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s gaze only darkened once Mu Ye left. There was something off about Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>After resting for a while longer, he had recovered enough inner strength to revolve it around his body. Only then did he gently pat Tang Doudou\u2019s face to wake her. \u201cWife, it\u2019s about time to wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes twitched but she didn\u2019t open her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019re not asleep. Be good, alright? Wake up, we need to leave now.\u201d Baili Yu pinched the tip of Tang Doudou\u2019s nose. She had been lying in his arms, so he naturally knew when she had woken up.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou opened her eyes unhappily when her act was exposed and glared at him. Following that, she asked curiously, \u201cThe things Lan Jia said, were they true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d Baili Yu set her down and stood up. \u201cLet\u2019s talk as we walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded and started walking behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is my father.\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s voice contained slight hatred as he said this. However, he concealed it very deeply so not even Tang Doudou noticed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, he doesn\u2019t deserve to be! Back then, Mother had given birth to me not long after she returned to the Imperial City. After he found out, he sent people to the Imperial City to steal me and bring me back to Cerulean Mountain. When I was brought back, he threw me directly into a pond of poison. Ha\u2026 This is what my birth father is like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jia was actually that evil!</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, for some reason, someone brought me to Wind Cloud Island. When I ended up inadvertently encountering Lan Jia, his age seemed similar to mine back then, so we became good friends that kept no secrets from each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow hateful! He definitely approached you on purpose!\u201d Tang Doudou was indignant. Although she didn\u2019t know the reasoning behind Lan Jia\u2019s actions, but not even cruel tigers ate their own cubs, yet he had been so malicious towards his own son.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His flung off hand felt as empty as his heart.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray climbed out from a corner and started going \u2018zhizhi\u2019 as he gestured.</p><br/><p>Light lit up the depths of Mu Ye\u2019s eyes. \u201cSomeone led her over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw that person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person that came with her? And a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray nodded, then gestured a whole bunch again. Mu Ye\u2019s expression immediately turned worried and he lifted Lil\u2019 Gray before chasing after Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was running on the street without any direction in mind. She just wanted to vent all the sadness and hurt in her heart, but every time she recalled how Baili Yu and Nangong Yan had walked side by side together, her heart would be seized with pain again.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu ah, Baili Yu. If he didn\u2019t love her that much, then why did he say those things to her? If he couldn\u2019t bear to let go of his junior sister, why did he act like he didn\u2019t care about her?</p><br/><p>The ornamental thumb ring that was hanging at her chest was slightly cold. The bound hair was still tightly wrapped by the red string. Tang Doudou grabbed the ring. She felt like the waves of cold was penetrating her body and was seized by the impulse to rip it off and throw it far away. However, when she prepared to do so, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cJeje, you sure look sad!\u201d Suddenly, a hoarse voice that sounded like grating metal appeared.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes widened. When she saw Shen Moru, she subconsciously retreated a couple steps. However, when she recalled how he had killed Mu Ye, her breath caught and she forced herself to stop. \u201cShen Moru!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you surprised to see me? Jeje, I\u2019m surprised too. I hadn\u2019t expected that we would meet so soon.\u201d His completely white eyes that were like those of a demon\u2019s were extremely eerie.</p><br/><p>With danger right in front of her, Tang Doudou could only suppress the sadness in her heart in order to focus on dealing with this situation. She fixed her gaze on Shen Moru warily.</p><br/><p>Shen Moru laughed coldly. \u201cI never thought that there would be a day in which I, Shen Moru, also made an error in judgement. After your power erupted, your strength was seriously wonderful. It\u2019s practically like a present the Heavens have decided to grant me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSadly, that scene will probably never occur again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t respond and simply watched as he talked to himself like a lunatic. His empty eyes would move from time to time, sending out cold, bloodthirsty glints.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaint City prohibits armed confrontation. Could it be that you, a Saint King, plans to break the rules knowingly?\u201d If she could make her power explode whenever she wanted, she wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid of Shen Moru. Unfortunately, she was still the same old Tang Doudou and could only resort to trying to scare Shen Moru off.</p><br/><p>Shen Moru smiled coldly. \u201cI was the one who personally drafted that law. Do you think I\u2019d be worried about such a law?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Saint Tribes are so large, you definitely aren\u2019t the only Saint King. I don\u2019t believe that they would allow you to do as you please!\u201d The Seven Great Saint Tribes haven\u2019t gotten along since ancient times. Nowadays, they were only acting united on the surface. In reality, they were constantly scheming against each other and keeping each other in check. These were all things that Tang Doudou had learned about later.</p><br/><p>When Shen Moru heard this, he glanced at her with surprise. \u201cLooks like you did plenty of homework after you got back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s brows knitted slightly. Then he continued, \u201cBut, so what? As of now, no one has the ability to stop me! Tang Doudou, you had best behave. If you do, you\u2019ll suffer less! Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you later!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Shen Moru spoke, he attacked. His five withered fingers were like fatal ice hooks as they flew towards Tang Doudou. Tang Doudou hastily revolved her inner strength and ducked to the side to narrowly avoid this fatal strike.</p><br/><p>Shen Moru clearly had no plans to capture her alive this time. He wanted to take her life!</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou\u2019s thoughts reached this point, she no longer hesitated and sent all her inner strength into her legs in order to flee.</p><br/><p>She had thought about just dying to end it all, but even if she were to die, she couldn\u2019t allow herself to die in Shen Moru\u2019s hands. That fate couldn\u2019t even be called death!</p><br/><p>Shen Moru wasn\u2019t worried when she tried to run. He just laughed, then followed her steadily. He seemed to be enjoying a leisurely game of cat and mouse.</p><br/><p>It was seriously a case of another wave arising before one even calmed. Why did she have such bad luck!?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently cursed, then started looking around. She thought hard for a way to defeat Shen Moru. There was actually a way, but she couldn\u2019t use it in this situation.</p><br/><p>The thumb ring at her chest kept bouncing with her movements, causing her to feel vexed. If she hadn\u2019t run out along, Shen Moru wouldn\u2019t have acted so fast. From the looks of it, he was quite afraid of Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou\u2019s thoughts reached this point, she slapped herself. She had almost caused Mu Ye to die last time. This time she only hoped that Mu Ye would get as far away as possible and that he hadn\u2019t dumbly chased after her!</p><br/><p>However, right after she thought that, she saw Mu Ye\u2019s figure appear not far away from them.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

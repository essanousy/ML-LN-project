Is it already over?\u201d Tang Doudou lifted her head and saw that they were already at an unfamiliar place.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye nodded before setting her down on a nearby rock. He then proceeded to cut open his sleeve and retrieve some medicine.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily snatched the medicine from him. \u201cI\u2019ll apply it for you. It\u2019ll be hard for you to do it with only one hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought that Mu Ye would refuse her help, but he simply turned his head to the side.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was stunned for a moment, but she soon came to her senses and pulled of the bottle cork. After pouring the medicinal powder evenly on the injury, she ripped a piece of cloth from the hem of her garments and bandaged his wound before asking, \u201cThe Disseminating Tassel Fragrance in your body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fused.\u201d Mu Ye turned his head slightly as a trace of firmness flashed through his cold eyes. \u201cThey now have one more target.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou who was cleaning up the bloody scraps of cloth on the ground froze for a moment when she heard this. She didn\u2019t dare to think deeply about the meaning contained in those words.</p><br/><p>Luckily, Mu Ye didn\u2019t continue this topic since he wasn\u2019t a talkative person from the start. After resting for a while, he started urging Tang Doudou to move again.</p><br/><p>Since he was injured, Tang Doudou refused to allow him to carry her anymore. She used qinggong and slowly flew forward.</p><br/><p>Although it was slow, it was still faster than walking.</p><br/><p>The rest of their journey was calm and eventless. After half a day, the two arrived to the gate of Saint City.</p><br/><p>They stole two black robes and tablets, and then snuck into the city with them.</p><br/><p>The inside of the city was actually not much different from regular city streets. Both sides of the street were filled with vendors and pedestrians.</p><br/><p>The only difference was that everyone here concealed their faces and figures. It was possible to still distinguish the genders of some, but many were completely concealed.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but silently remark that there were definitely a lot of swindlers here!</p><br/><p>Mu Ye had warned her before they entered the city that she should try to avoid speaking as much as possible. He even stuffed Lil\u2019 Gray into her black robe so that he stayed on her back, making her look like a hunchback.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was fine with it since it helped to conceal her identity. After all, who would have imagined that she would pretend to be a hunchback?</p><br/><p>After entering the city, Mu Ye found an inn and booked two rooms. He then instructed Tang Doudou to head in and rest before leaving by himself.</p><br/><p>It was unknown what he headed off to do.</p><br/><p>After entering the room, Tang Doudou put Lil\u2019 Gray down, then took off the black robe before lying down comfortably on the bed. She had only lay down for a while when a knocking came from the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear guest, the food you ordered has arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was a waiter. But, when did she order food?</p><br/><p>Even as she wondered, she pulled the black robe back on until only her eyes were exposed. She stuffed the unwilling monkey back on her back before slowly walking over to open the door.</p><br/><p>The waiter was also dressed in a black robe that covered him from head to toe and only left his fawning eyes uncovered. He immediately carried the food in when she opened the door. \u201cThe guest that left just now ordered these for you. Please take your time and enjoy. Do let us know if you need anything else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Tang Doudou squeezed her throat and spoke in a slightly hoarse voice.</p><br/><p>The waiter hastily repeated that it wasn\u2019t much and withdrew.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou stayed by the door the entire time and only moved to close the door once the waiter left. However, right at this time, she saw a group of black-clothed people enter the inn.</p><br/><p>A man and a woman led the group.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou recognized them by their eyes with one glance.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t they Nangong Yan and Murong Ming?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t keep watching because her first glance already attracted Murong Ming\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t panic either. She simply shifted her gaze away and walked into the room, closing the door behind her. She then stayed by the door to listen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d It was Nangong Yan\u2019s voice. When Baili Yu wasn\u2019t present, her tone was always filled with arrogance.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. It just so happened that someone upstairs had glanced this way,\u201d replied Murong Ming.</p><br/><p>Nangong Yan immediately became nervous. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Ming said, \u201cIt was just a coincidental look. It\u2019s not someone we know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShopkeeper, give us three high quality rooms!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear guest, I apologize but there are only two high quality rooms left,\u201d replied the shopkeeper with an apologetic smile.</p><br/><p>This group of people gave off an aggressive air. The shopkeeper could tell with a single glance that it wouldn\u2019t be good to provoke them, so he could only humble himself to try to keep them happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? With how crappy your store is, how could it be full? You sure have guts as to try and lie to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper replied with something, but Tang Doudou had lost interest in listening. She returned to the table and glanced at the abundance of dishes. Pretty much every plate had meat.</p><br/><p>A trace of a smile flashed through her bright eyes. It seemed that Mu Ye had noticed her craving for meat. She picked up the chopsticks and was just about to start eating when Lil\u2019 Gray twitched on her back.</p><br/><p>Only then did Tang Doudou remember that he was there and took him off her back. \u201cLil\u2019 Gray? Do you eat meat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray shook his head firmly, but when he saw the dishes on the table, he immediately clutched his chest like his heart was breaking.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou burst out laughing. She then picked out some vegetables and placed it in front of him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t eat meat, just have some vegetables!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray immediately bounced up and down. After bowing towards her, he lowered his head to eat.</p><br/><p>However, he suddenly screeched. Tang Doudou was alarmed and hastily covered his mouth. When she saw that the screech hadn\u2019t attracted any trouble, she lowered her eyes and lifted Lil\u2019 Gray. \u201cWhy are you screaming all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Gray pointed at the dishes on the table, and then clutched his neck abruptly.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

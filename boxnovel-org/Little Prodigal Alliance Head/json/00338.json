She was certain that she knew him, but no matter how she thought about it, she couldn\u2019t recall when she had seen him. When Baili Yu called her over to wash up and took off his human skin mask, revealing his enchanting true features, Tang Doudou froze as if she had been struck by lightning.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu looked towards her in puzzlement. \u201cWhat is it? Is there something on my face? Or is it that Wife doesn\u2019t like this face anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pushed her jaw back up and shook her head. \u201cNo, I was just thinking about that person dressed in black from yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Baili Yu quickly made a shush motion towards her, then pulled her to the table. Getting out paper and a brush, he quickly wrote with elegant strokes: Be careful, the walls have ears.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily covered her mouth and glanced around. She recalled that the room Nangong Yan had entered seemed to have been the one to their left. Although this inn had pretty good soundproofing, those people were martial arts experts and their hearing was better than that of most people. If they listened purposefully and actually overheard them, her actions would really be that of hanging the god of longevity in order to court death!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou took the brush and chewed it for a while as she thought, then she wrote with crooked letters: The person from yesterday is Lan Jia.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu frowned in response to Tang Doudou\u2019s ugly writing and the name Lan Jia. He wrote: Who\u2019s Lan Jia? Who taught you to write?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou: Are you saying that my writing is ugly?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu: No.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou: Lan Jia is your father.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu: My father? Wife, please stop joking.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou: I\u2019m not joking.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know what to do for a moment, then she plopped herself on a chair and wrote a whole bunch about Baili Yu\u2019s past. After finishing, she pushed it over for Baili Yu to read.</p><br/><p>However, her writing was seriously hard to read. It took Baili Yu quite a long time to puzzle out her words. He picked up another piece of paper and wrote: So those three are also after us?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou wrote in reply: En, so we have to hurry and leave.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu then collected all the papers and walked to the candle. He noticed the crumpled piece of paper Tang Doudou had thrown yesterday, so he picked it up and burned it as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Wife is feeling better, let\u2019s pack up and go home after we eat!\u201d said Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou knew that this was said for their neighbors to hear, so she replied, \u201cYes, let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, there wasn\u2019t much to pack. After hiding the box inside a cloth bundle and placing it in a hidden location, they walked downstairs together to have breakfast.</p><br/><p>However, they had bad luck. Although they had been so careful earlier in worry that their neighbors would overhear them, it turned out that their neighbors were already downstairs and silently eating.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou saw that Nangong Yan was being completely quiet, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder what method Liu Zhiyuan had used to make Nangong Yan behave.</p><br/><p>But Lan Jia was Nangong Yan\u2019s father. Would he really allow Liu Zhiyuan to bully his daughter?</p><br/><p>She was pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t, unless he wasn\u2019t rational and had gone completely crazy.</p><br/><p>They sat down far away. Baili Yu called over the waiter and said, \u201cBring us two bowls of clear porridge and a few steamed buns. Bring two plates of yesterday\u2019s pastries as well. I want to take them with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the two guests looked old and ugly, they were actually quite generous with money so the waiter liked them. He immediately went to prepare the order.</p><br/><p>When Nangong Yan, who was originally eating calmly, ended up noticing them, she threw her chopsticks on the table and said with disgust, \u201cWhy are those rotting old farts still here? It\u2019s seriously disgusting to eat in the same room as them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan glanced at her, then glanced over at Tang Doudou\u2019s table. His sharp gaze gave Tang Doudou goosebumps, so she feigned fear and shuddered.</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan retrieved his gaze and turned back to Nangong Yan. In a commanding way, he said, \u201cEat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Yan mouthed a silent complaint, then glare angrily at Tang Doudou. \u201cI\u2019m done, I\u2019m full!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop raising a fuss. Right now, you need to take care of two. If you don\u2019t eat more and something happens to the child, I\u2019ll make you pay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Zhiyuan!\u201d When this was brought up, Nangong Yan immediately reacted like a provoked lion and swept all the food off the table. Lan Jia didn\u2019t react and just lowered his bowl and chopsticks without a word.</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan slapped his chopsticks down and glared coldly at Nangong Yan. \u201cSit down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t! If you have the ability to, kill me!\u201d Nangong Yan\u2019s eyes were resolute. Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but furrow her brows when she saw this.</p><br/><p>However, if they continued acting unperturbed, they\u2019d be noticed, so Tang Doudou threw herself towards Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband, I\u2019m so scared. Let\u2019s go eat somewhere else, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu looked down at her crafty little face and said, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter had rushed out when he heard this disturbance. When he saw that the place was a mess, he became anxious, but he didn\u2019t dare to rush up and could only go around dispersing the other diners.</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize, everyone. How\u2019s this? I\u2019ll deliver your food to your rooms in a little bit? There won\u2019t be any extra fees!\u201d Usually, there was a little additional fee for delivery to the room.</p><br/><p>A lot of people immediately agreed to this suggestion since no one wanted to get involved.</p><br/><p>However, someone showed up who insisted on heading straight towards the mountain with tigers.</p><br/><p>A young man that looked obviously wealthy walked right in. When he saw the situation, he laughed. \u201cIt seems quite lively!</p><br/><p>\u201cWaiter, hurry up and bring this young master good wine and food!\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter greeted him awkwardly. \u201cThis guest, would you like a private room upstairs?\u201d</p><br/><p>This suggestion was so that this seemingly defenseless young man wouldn\u2019t get hurt. In addition, his clothes were of high quality, and most people that were dressed like this usually asked for a private room.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After all, she had been imbued with the thinking of this era since she was little. Even though she didn\u2019t seem like those extremely humble and submissive yes-man maids from other families, the idea of respecting the master was a very deep rooted ideology which couldn\u2019t be changed with only a couple spoken sentences.</p><br/><p>In any case, since Baili Yu has already allowed Qing Yin to follow her, wouldn\u2019t it be better to just gradually influence and change her?</p><br/><p>But before this, she must find a chance to clear up their relationship and clearly explain to her that they were impossible. Perhaps it was better to just directly tell her about her female identity. But this also required an opportunity.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the right time to do so anyhow, so let\u2019s hold off for now.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s first deal with the matter regarding Bai Feiyun before thinking further.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had obtained the Alliance Head Command Tablet so she was now heading to the Alliance Head Residence to find out the specifics of the situation before returning to meet up with Bai Lianhua in four hours.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou explained her plans to Qing Yin, she saw the latter wasn\u2019t surprised that Bai Lianhua was coming along. After some consideration, Qing Yin suggested, \u201cGongzi can just ask Young Master Jun for help to save Bai gongzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Xin?\u201d Tang Doudou hastily shook her head, \u201cNo way, that guy would completely wreck things, we can\u2019t bring him along.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin spoke with a helpless tone, \u201cYoung Master Jun is very capable, he\u2019s not like gongzi\u2019s impression of him at all. At the very least, gongzi wouldn\u2019t have to worry about your own safety with him around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, my Eight Characters (of birthtime, more info here) clash with his, just encountering him annoys me. Not to mention, what we\u2019re doing is exchanging for a hostage and negotiating. Let\u2019s just shelf things like using force for now. This Alliance Head is a civilized person!\u201d Tang Doudou patted her chest. She then rubbed her nose, \u201cLet\u2019s go and take a look at the situation in the Alliance Head Residence before discussing more.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she had Qing Yin lead her out of this garden which she\u2019d been staying in for this past week or so.</p><br/><p>After walking out of the enormous front entrance, an indescribable feeling surfaced as she looked at the old-fashioned, calm, bluestone-paved street outside.</p><br/><p>Turning back to look at the garden behind her, she only just realized that the seemingly exquisite and gentle garden she saw from the inside actually had such an unusual grandeur when viewed from outside. As she stood in front of the entrance, she felt extremely insignificant.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smacked her lips as her gaze moved upwards. She still didn\u2019t know what this garden was called after having been here for this long!</p><br/><p>But she immediately discovered that she couldn\u2019t understand the words on the rectangle sign above the garden doors at all. So she asked Qing Yin: \u201cQing Yin ah, what\u2019s this garden called?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlum Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there three words written? How could it be Plum Garden?\u201d Not to mention she had already stayed there for a week and hadn\u2019t seen even a petal of a plum blossom, so how did that name fit at all?</p><br/><p>Qing Yin saw her surprised expression and of course knew what she was thinking. \u201cPlum Garden is an alternate name, what\u2019s written on the sign is \u2018Serene Transient Life\u2019*.\u201d</p><br/><p>The name of the garden is , which I searched up and the closest saying I got to the title was (roughly transient life, serene dream) which means that the fleeting hollow life felt like a serene dream. The term in baidu is elaborated as \u2018such that life seemed like a meaningless transient existence, such that death seems to be its cessation.\u2019 Very beautiful and profound, my vocab doesn\u2019t do it justice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a sea of plums at the back mountain of the garden. Thus, it also became known as Plum Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that this garden still has a back mountain? There\u2019s also a sea of plums there? My crap, then isn\u2019t this garden really really big?\u201d</p><br/><p>Da fudge, how big was this garden?</p><br/><p>Qing Yin proudly said: \u201cThat\u2019s only natural. Who in this world doesn\u2019t know that Master\u2019s Plum Garden is number one in the country? Not only does the back mountain have an endlessly extending sea of plums, but there\u2019s a peach garden, a sea of cherry-apples, a lotus flower pond\u2026and even more marvels of the world gathered here. The two buildings that gongzi went to earlier were areas in between the four buildings of wind, flower, snow and moon(common poetry subjects). Perhaps it doesn\u2019t look that special from gongzi\u2019s point of view, but in reality, these things were all carefully selected for quality.\u201d</p><br/><p>She paused for a moment and looked at Tang Doudou\u2019s blank eyes, then said: \u201cMaybe gongzi should just let this servant take you around for a look some other day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Tang Doudou heard this, she hastily waved dismissively and said: \u201cForget it, let\u2019s deal with the proper business first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hell, there\u2019s no way she wanted to come back to this lousy place, there was no need to even mention having the interest to take a look around.</p><br/><p>Also, da fudge! The damned fox seriously had a level of boldness that can just rush to the skies, so much so that it splashed her whole face(like it was rubbed in her face).</p><br/><p>In the past, she had already heard Qing Yin talk about how this Plum Garden was actually just one area amongst all his estates, but just based on this title of being the number one garden in the country was enough to guess how valuable it was. There was no need to even mention what Qing Yin said about those various seas of flowers and other marvels at all. Da fudge, this was the ancient era. These places were all being taken care of through manpower. Just the cost of keeping all these people was a great expense.</p><br/><p>It was already beyond Tang Doudou\u2019s power to fathom Baili Yu\u2019s family property. The more she thought about it, the more she regret. Why didn\u2019t she just bite him to death with that one chomp earlier?</p><br/><p>Qing Yin said that the Alliance Head Residence was right next door to the Plum Garden, but Qing Yin found a carriage from somewhere and invited Tang Doudou to get on after they left the Plum Garden.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was originally puzzled, but recalling what Qing Yin said earlier, she decisively climbed into the carriage. Hell, what Qing Yin called next door probably wasn\u2019t the \u2018next door\u2019 she knew. This distance probably wasn\u2019t small in any way.</p><br/><p>As expected, the carriage leisurely moved for about an hour. Just as Tang Doudou was almost rocked to sleep, Qing Yin lightly shook her awake, \u201cGongzi, we\u2019ve arrived at the Alliance Head Residence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou opened her hazy eyes and gazed at Qing Yin\u2019s veiled face in a dazed manner. Only then did her head clear up, \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes gongzi have an understanding of the Alliance Head Residence\u2019s current situation?\u201d Qing Yin hastily pulled her to a stop after seeing that Tang Doudou was about the head down the carriage the moment she climbed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat situation?\u201d Tang Doudou had just woken up and her head was still pretty muddled. Adding on the fact that she really wasn\u2019t clear on what situation the Alliance Head Residence would have, she thought it could only be the matter regarding Elder Yu. She proceeded to say, \u201cAre you talking about Elder Yu and the rest? Bai Feiyun mentioned a bit to me before. What about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin cast a glance at her. She was silent for a bit before finally saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too late to give a detailed explanation now. How about this, you can just look at my expression as a guide after we enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExpression?\u201d Tang Doudou swept a glance at Qing Yin\u2019s hazy veiled face and thought dejectedly, how am I supposed to see like this?</p><br/><p>Qing Yin also realized this problem. Her face turned slightly red, and she spoke in a small voice: \u201cGongzi, wait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said so, she bowed her head and lowered her pupils. Her soft jade fingers reached behind and removed the veil.</p><br/><p>Following that, a swan egg-shaped little face appeared. It was especially delicate and beautiful. A pair of gentle pupils faced downwards, too bashful to look towards Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin\u2019s temperament was very good from the start. Now, this face was added on top of that. Tang Doudou was considerably stunned, and at the same time couldn\u2019t help but start envying Baili Yu again. Hell, unless she wasn\u2019t recalling properly, the group of maids from the other day were all akin to Qing Yin. Even though they were wearing veils based on Qing Yin\u2019s appearance, they were probably all exceptional beauties.</p><br/><p>She also couldn\u2019t help but think that it was obvious why Baili Yu didn\u2019t take a fancy to Bai Lianhua.</p><br/><p>Da fudge, if one were to just randomly pull a servant girl out, not a single one would lose to Bai Lianhua in terms of appearance ah! It would truly be a strange matter if he really did take fancy to Bai Lianhua in this situation.</p><br/><p>After seeing numerous beautiful girls, he probably got quite tired of them. That\u2019s probably why he raised Jun Xin, this tsundere little uke to adjust his mood a little?</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that he could just casually gift her a maid like Qing Yin. It turned out that he simply wasn\u2019t lacking whatsoever!</p><br/><p>Damned inhumane nouveau riche!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin, you\u2019re so pretty, so why must you hide it with a veil?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis servant doesn\u2019t know either, but it was Master\u2019s order.\u201d Qing Yin paused for a while and her emotions gradually calmed down. She slowly lifted her head and replied as such.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Tang Doudou disdained Baili Yu again, then said: \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get off first!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them got off the horse carriage one after another.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had already come up with many ideas of what she envisioned the Alliance Head Residence to be like before she headed over. After all, an official residence that dared establish itself next to that damned fox\u2019s place probably can\u2019t be too lacking, right?</p><br/><p>Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t it just be slapping your own face?</p><br/><p>But the moment she got off the carriage and saw that simple and crude official residence next to that high wall, her heart crumbled apart.</p><br/><p>This was the rumored Alliance Head Residence?</p><br/><p>Da fudge, wasn\u2019t this a little too unpresentable!?</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi?\u201d Seeing that Tang Doudou was blanking out, Qing Yin softly called her, \u201cThere are people coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately returned to her senses and looked towards her. Afterwards, she saw two young men dressed in gray garments had arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask if you are Li Xueyi? Alliance Head Li?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man walking in front cupped his fist towards Tang Doudou and used a very polite tone to ask this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, may I ask who the two of you are?\u201d Tang Doudou also cupped a fist in salute. Out of the corners of her eyes, she saw Qing Yin slightly wink towards her and immediately understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is the Alliance Head ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in the back approached with large happy steps, \u201cAlliance Head, you\u2019ve finally returned!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sincere apologies, I\u2019ve made you wait long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like this, Alliance Head\u2019s health is more important. If it weren\u2019t for that fact that Bai gongzi\u2019s situation was far too severe this time around, no one would\u2019ve rashly gone to find Alliance Head. However, since Alliance Head has returned, then that\u2019s great!\u201d The man in front spoke while being slightly emotional.</p><br/><p>\u201cAy, Li Hong, talk a little less. Hurry and invite the Alliance Head inside!\u201d The other man standing next to Li Hong pulled him out of the way. \u201cAlliance Head, this subordinate is Xu Tao, and this one is Li Hong. We\u2019re in charge of the Alliance Head Residence\u2019s defense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, so it was the security guard captain!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded her head to express her understanding. While walking, she asked: \u201cEarlier, when Syndicate Leader Xu came over, he didn\u2019t explain things very clearly. What exactly happened with Bai gongzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao looked much more calm and collected than Li Hong. Hearing Tang Doudou ask about this, he muttered irresolutely to himself for a while before saying: \u201cCould it be that Syndicate Leader Xu didn\u2019t tell Alliance Head everything? Though this incident with Bai gongzi is said to be due to the situation between the Alliance Head and the Murong family, in reality, it wasn\u2019t that simple. However, this subordinate also doesn\u2019t know many details regarding this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you guys also aren\u2019t clear on this matter, then who is?\u201d Tang Doudou saw the faint uneasiness in his eyes and couldn\u2019t help but think longer about it. She thought that this matter wasn\u2019t that simple from the very start. Unexpectedly, there really was an inside story.</p><br/><p>Hearing her ask this, Xu Tao and Li Hong shared a glance, then said simultaneously: \u201cElder Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Tao continued to explain, \u201cThis information was sent back by Elder Yu, so if you want to know the exacts of the situation, you can only go ask Elder Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hell I give a pei! Sure enough, that old bastard was involved.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just go ask him. Where\u2019s Elder Yu right now?\u201d Tang Doudou asked again.</p><br/><p>Li Hong said: \u201cElder Yu hasn\u2019t returned since the martial arts convention. He\u2019s been in the Alliance Head Residence the entire time, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly stopped. After glancing left and right, he suddenly moved to Tang Doudou\u2019s ear and whispered a few sentences. Afterwards, he even exposed a slightly evil smile.</p><br/><p>Hearing it, Tang Doudou froze for a moment, but she started smiling soon after as well. She hooked her arm around Li Hong\u2019s shoulder and said roguishly: \u201cIs that all true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hong hastily nodded, \u201cEveryone knows about this, it\u2019s just that everyone\u2019s too embarrassed to make it known in public.\u201d</p><br/><p>This disjointed conversation between the two caused the other two to be completely befuddled. What \u2018xactly were they talking about?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What Heaven\u2019s will? He had never believed in that. Since he got Cang Baicao\u2019s promise and had five day\u2019s time, he had to hurry and set out. Finding rootless grass wasn\u2019t an easy task.</p><br/><p>The only thing he was worried about was, once he left, without a single strong person in Azure Water Valley, what if there was an intruder\u2026</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao seemed to see his apprehensions since he laughed lightly while stroking his beard. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this valley of mine isn\u2019t open to just anyone. After all, if anyone could enter, wouldn\u2019t my doorstep already have been trampled flat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was still hesitant. If Azure Water Valley was capable of keeping out martial art experts, Xiao Ren and Xiao Yi wouldn\u2019t have died.</p><br/><p>He had taken a look at the library earlier and seen those blade marks on the bookshelves. The person that killed Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren had martial arts comparable to his.</p><br/><p>He would still win in a direct confrontation, but if he left, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone in Azure Water Valley that was a match for that person.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d Cang Baicao had lived for a long time so he was able to see through what Baili Yu was thinking with one glance. His expression turned displeased and he asked again, \u201cOh that\u2019s right, where did you put my Xiao Ren and Xiao Yi? I haven\u2019t seen them since I came back. The only reason you guys were able to come in and out of Azure Water Valley freely was because I didn\u2019t set up the traps. After you leave, I\u2019ll have Xiao Ren and Xiao Yi set up all the traps. Even if the traps don\u2019t manage to keep the intruders out, there\u2019s still the poison smoke that I personally created. There\u2019s not many people in the world that can stand up to that. I\u2019ve already put things this way, are your worries at ease now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced at him. He was a lot less worried. Although those two things wouldn\u2019t be able to stop the intruder if he chose to come, it would hinder him for a couple days. He just had to find the rootless grass and come back as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>However, when Cang Baicao mentioned Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren, he hesitated for a while before finally telling Cang Baicao about their deaths.</p><br/><p>Although he had been tactful about it, Cang Baicao was angered to the point that his face turned white. \u201cWho, who did it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Something flashed through Baili Yu\u2019s eyes when he saw how astonished Cang Baicao was. \u201cI don\u2019t know who did it. When I got back, it was my subordinates that found their memorial tablets in the library. Their graves are outside the valley. Based on how new they were, it was probably Doudou that buried them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe library?\u201d Something seemed to occur to Cang Baicao because his face became even paler and he walked straight towards the library.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced at Tang Doudou, then at Cang Baicao. Even though he was still a little worried, he followed Cang Baicao.</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao stumbled the entire way to the library. His wrinkled hand trembled uncontrollably as he slowly pushed open the door and walked with heavy steps inside.</p><br/><p>Once he got to the place that had so many dried bloodstains that the original color of the ground couldn\u2019t be made out, he walked straight towards the hidden box and opened it. Upon seeing that it was empty, his pupils abruptly dilated and he vomited blood. He seemed to age ten years in that instant. Strength left his body and his body swayed dangerously. Baili Yu hastily walked up to support him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Cang, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao abruptly started laughing loudly, almost insanely. \u201cAfter playing as a hawk for an entire lifetime, in my old age, I was actually blinded by another hawk! I was blind, I was blind ah! Hahaha!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s expression stiffened. Cang Baicao\u2019s words were clearly saying that Bai Feiyun was the one that killed Xiao Yi abd Xiao Ren.</p><br/><p>When he recalled how Cang Baicao had always taught Bai Feiyun everything he knew without holding anything back, he also felt very disappointed and frustrated. He helped Cang Baicao out of the library. As he glanced back one last time at the blade marks, confusion appeared in his eyes. When did Bai Feiyun start using a sword?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s martial arts weren\u2019t that good, but this person\u2019s martial arts were only a little inferior to his. Was it really Bai Feiyun?</p><br/><p>Why would he do this?</p><br/><p>He had already investigated Bai Feiyun thoroughly when he first made contact with Tang Doudou. He was, as everyone knew, completely unbiased towards anyone. Everyone including Cang Baicao who was in contact with him felt deep admiration for his talents and personality.</p><br/><p>Why would an elegant gentleman repeatedly do such immoral things?</p><br/><p>What exactly was hidden in all of these events?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

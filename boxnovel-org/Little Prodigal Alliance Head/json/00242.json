They were just waiting for her to come before departing.</p><br/><p>This time Tang Doudou didn\u2019t sit in a carriage all by herself. Instead, she shared one with Baili Yu that was driven by Feng Long. At the other carriage, Jun Xin was complaining incessantly as Bai Lianhua awkwardly got on, followed by Yuner.</p><br/><p>Yuner been with the group all along but Tang Doudou was a little scared of him after that last incident. It was just like encountering the Seven Great Saint Tribes, his strange abilities made one\u2019s heart fill with dread. Thus, she didn\u2019t dare to approach Yuner much anymore.</p><br/><p>It was so much so that she even forgot to tell him that she encountered San Yu in Cloud City.</p><br/><p>Yuner seemed to have sensed her gaze as he said a few words to Jun Xin before coming over.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at Baili Yu, but he just smiled at her before closing his eyes, so she jumped off the carriage and stood in front of Yuner awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Yuner\u2019s eyes were as bright and clear as before. However, he didn\u2019t give off that foolish feeling anymore, nor did he have that submissive yes-man attitude from before. Now, he just seemed like a youngster with a gentle and elegant temperament. </p><br/><p>He looked at Tang Doudou with an apologetic expression on his good-looking face. \u201cBeautiful Big Sister, I\u2019m sorry about that last incident, Yuner wasn\u2019t deliberately trying to frighten Beautiful Big Sister. The situation was just so urgent. If I didn\u2019t make Big Sister lose consciousness, then the poison would have spread through your entire body. If that happened, the situation would have gotten even worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin already explained this to her after the incident, so Tang Doudou didn\u2019t take it to heart. Now that this was brought up, she answered honestly, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I already know about the situation so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuner still looked apologetic. \u201cI wanted to come over and apologize to Big Sister, but hadn\u2019t had a chance to. Back then, I ended up using more energy than my body could handle and injured myself. This matter only got delayed for so long because I had to spend the last few days treating my injury..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your injury now?\u201d After a few words, Tang Doudou feeling of discomfort towards Yuner had disappeared. Yuner was still the same Yuner. The only difference was that he was no longer so foolish and that should count as a good thing!</p><br/><p>Yuner replied, \u201cI\u2019m almost fully recovered. I wouldn\u2019t be out otherwise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, it\u2019s good that you\u2019ve recovered. Oh, that\u2019s right, there\u2019s something else that I wanted to tell you. But, don\u2019t get overly excited, alright? I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019ve recognized the right person or not either,\u201d said Tang Doudou. Then she proceeded to tell him everything about her encounter with San Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe told me that I was mistaken. I don\u2019t think I was but she kept acting like she didn\u2019t know me so there was nothing I could do.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Tang Doudou was speaking, she peeked to check Yuner\u2019s expression. Surprisingly, his face didn\u2019t contain any anxiousness nor any excitement. Contrary to expectations, he seemed very calm. \u201cSan Yu probably didn\u2019t want us to know about this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>San Yu?</p><br/><p>Not Big Sister San Yu?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at Yuner in surprise. Could it be after becoming more intelligent, he didn\u2019t feel that sort of attachment to San Yu anymore? </p><br/><p>That was why he didn\u2019t feel anything even when San Yu\u2019s matter was brought up?</p><br/><p>If that was the case, it\u2019d really be sad!</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful Big Sister, if there\u2019s nothing else, then I\u2019ll return to the carriage now. For the next few days, Big Sister must remember to not lean your head on the left side.\u201d After saying that, he turned around and walked back.</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou watched him walk away, she rubbed the left side of her head. How come it felt like Yuner was becoming more and more like a fake Daoist priest?</p><br/><p>He said to not lean her head to the left side. Could it be that her neck would hurt if she did?</p><br/><p>She shrugged and climbed into the carriage without taking the warning seriously.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

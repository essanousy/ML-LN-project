She took out some hemostatics and bandages from the small bag she always kept with her. As she applied the medicine, she said, \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t come back, you\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin tugged his lips into a weak smile. \u201cIf I\u2019m dead, then I\u2019m dead, but you were practically choosing to head into death. Aren\u2019t you afraid of dying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be scared of?\u201d Baili Yiling\u2019s hand froze for a moment, then she replied in an unconcerned tone.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was surprised that she actually thought this way as well.</p><br/><p>When Baili Yiling saw the surprise on his face, she laughed. \u201cWhat? You think my way of thinking is strange? That anyone should be afraid of death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, he thought the same.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid of dying, so what was there to fear about death?</p><br/><p>However, he hadn\u2019t expected for Baili Yiling to also have the same opinion. Now he felt that she wasn\u2019t that annoying anymore.</p><br/><p>If Baili Yiling knew that Jun Xin\u2019s opinion of her was that she was annoying, she probably would\u2019ve kicked Jun Xin right down and left him for dead.</p><br/><p>But how could she possibly know what he was thinking? All she saw was that the look in Jun Xin\u2019s eyes had changed a little as he looked at her. He also seemed to be a little uncomfortable, so she sped up her movements and quickly finished applying the medicine, then bandaged his wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t talk and preserve your strength. Even though the mysterious person hasn\u2019t come to chase after us yet, we can\u2019t relax our guard. We can\u2019t stay here for long. Let\u2019s rest for a bit, then hurry and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she took out a dagger to cut the bandage and tie the ends.</p><br/><p>Following that, she took Jun Xin\u2019s other hand and checked his condition, then sighed. \u201cThe mysterious person\u2019s way of sealing your pressure points is too strange. I can\u2019t undo it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin glanced at her. When he saw that her face was filled with self-blame, he said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling nodded. She had already done her best. Worrying over things that she couldn\u2019t do was pointless.</p><br/><p>After resting a while, Jun Xin felt a little better and he spaced out while staring at the phoenix on Baili Yiling\u2019s forehead. After a long while, he asked, \u201cHow did you suddenly become so strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling was dumbfounded. She thought he hadn\u2019t noticed at all!</p><br/><p>Jun Xin reached out while she was still stunned to stroke the phoenix mark. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he looked towards Baili Yiling with no idea that his slight touch had stirred the strings of her heart and caused an emotion that not even she understood to flood up.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling could feel her heart pound. She lifted her head and just happened to meet Jun Xin\u2019s gaze head on. Her heart pounded so hard that she could barely breathe and had to turn her head away.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-this is\u2026 it\u2019s a sort of medical pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin furrowed his brows. Tang Doudou was the only one he would be very sensitive towards. Towards everyone else, he was pretty crude and boorish, so he didn\u2019t notice Baili Yiling\u2019s abnormailty at all and started wondering what this pill was.</p><br/><p>However, Baili Yiling didn\u2019t plan to explain things to him. She glanced behind them, then picked Jun Xin and placed him on her back this time as she started heading forward.</p><br/><p>She kept running until the horizon started brightening, then stopped, exhausted. She set Jun Xin down, then collapsed with him onto the sand.</p><br/><p>The sensation of the soft sand made her burst out laughing. She never thought that she had ended up fleeing with Jun Xin to the sea. She didn\u2019t know which coast this was either. If they wanted to head back, would they have to go past that manor again?</p><br/><p>But would Jun Xin be able to hold up for the time it\u2019d take for her to double back and find her way?</p><br/><p>Several hours had passed, so the effect of the pill was slowly fading away. Once the sun rose, she\u2019d be hit with the after effects of the pill, so\u2026</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling sat up again. The phoenix on her forehead was already starting to flicker in and out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted. Let\u2019s find a place to rest for now,\u201d said Baili Yiling to Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin opened his eyes a little. They didn\u2019t have medicine and he couldn\u2019t use his inner strength to treat his injuries, so his condition was rapidly getting worse. It was slowly eating away at his life, but he didn\u2019t tell Baili Yiling this and just nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling sighed in relief and bent over to set him on her back again. She slowly walked towards the left as the cool ocean breeze swept over them. This was the seaside, so there was definitely a fishing village around. Even if there weren\u2019t, a cave would work!</p><br/><p>However, after walking for a short while, she didn\u2019t encounter a fishing village. Instead, she encountered the person she hadn\u2019t wanted to see the most.</p><br/><p>The mysterious person had caught up with them.</p><br/><p>Without any sound or warning, he appeared and blocked her path.</p><br/><p>She could sense that his aura was now even stronger and filled with an even more frightening murderous aura. Even though he was just standing there, the aura he released pressured people to the point that they couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><br/><p>The instant Baili Yiling saw him, she despaired. They were going to die.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Xin struggled slightly on her back and said softly, \u201cLet\u2019s jump into the ocean!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Baili Yiling glanced back to see Jun Xin\u2019s expression, but it was a futile effort. There was no way her neck could twist that far.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin replied, \u201cIf you die in the ocean, your corpse will enter the bodies of fishes. They say that your soul will be carried by the fishes to the person you want to see most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at these words. He still had the mood to say such unreliable things in this sort of situation?</p><br/><p>However, she still glanced down at the nearby body of water, at the sparkling surface of the sea that was being dyed by the rising sun. The red light in her eyes slowly dimmed and the veined patterns on her body were gradually starting to disappear as well.</p><br/><p>A slightly moist wind swept towards them. The mysterious person had moved.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling also moved. She acted like she was dodging, but in reality, she was purposefully moving towards the ocean. There really was no other option but to take Jun Xin\u2019s suggestion and jump into the sea.</p><br/><p>However, she felt that drowning in the sea was better than dying at the hands of this person.</p><br/><p>Especially when Jun Xin would be with her\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How come it just doesn\u2019t seem real?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Baili Yu, who had been silent for quite a while, spoke, \u201cSince when did the Lou family have such a worthless family heirloom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWorthless?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a simple copper lamp. The craftwork is just a bit more elaborate, that\u2019s all. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that you, Xueyi, seemed to like it, why would I buy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was light and carried a faint pampering tone, causing Tang Doudou to be baffled and feel that there was something wrong with her ears.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, the Baili Yu in front of her must have been possessed by a ghost. His behavior was extremely strange, causing her to feel particularly uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>After Baili Yu said that the lamp wasn\u2019t worth that amount of money, Lou Qingyun became a bit embarrassed and could only fess up honestly. \u201cI won\u2019t keep it from you two, this lamp was something I picked up from the riverbank\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? And you dared to set a price of five thousand for something you picked up!? Lou Qingyun, you\u2019re truly even more black-hearted than a black-cored radish!\u201d In reality, Tang Doudou could also tell that this antique lamp wasn\u2019t valuable. However, her concern caused her heart to become chaotic. When she thought of this lamp\u2019s possible function, she couldn\u2019t calm down at all. Now that she Lou Qingyun came out with the truth, she immediately exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem. This is just a bet. When the time comes, I\u2019ll just send the money back to you!\u201d It wasn\u2019t like Lou Qingyun didn\u2019t have this amount of money either. It was just that when he made the bet, those guys had taken all the money on him. Now that he obtained some money, he had to head back to report. Once he won this competition, he could marry Lady Yun Yan, hehe\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing that Tang Doudou still had an enraged expression, Lou Qingyun scratched the back of his head in an embarrassed manner. \u201cAiyah, you can just rest easy. My reputation in Huai City can still be trusted!\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t delay any longer. If he delayed anymore, those guys would snatch the opportunity to find Lady Yun Yan first. At that time, wouldn\u2019t everything have gone to waste?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask Baili gongzi!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Tang Doudou possibly dare to ask Baili Yu? She was already saying amitabha buddha that he was just standing there without speaking!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do, I can\u2019t stop worrying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. If you can\u2019t trust me, just return the lamp to me and I\u2019ll hand these banknotes back to you. How about that?\u201d Even though he proposed this, Lou Qingyun didn\u2019t think that Tang Doudou would do so. Anyone with eyes could see that Tang Doudou cared a lot about this antique lamp. From how nervous she looked, perhaps this antique lamp was something she lost at the river.</p><br/><p>As expected, Tang Doudou shook her head immediately in response to his words. \u201cThat still won\u2019t do. I must have this lamp.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t work, that doesn\u2019t work. Alliance Head Li, suggest something that would work ah. I don\u2019t have the time to dawdle here with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this!?\u201d Tang Doudou had lowered her eyes to deliberate for a while, then thought of a great idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about what?\u201d Lou Qingyun saw that her eyes had lit up and guessed that she may have thought of an idea that satisfied both demands.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou put away that antique lamp first. After that, her eyes swept across Baili Yu who was acting as a backdrop. Only now did she start to become curious. Why is this evil spirit so low-key while heading out today? Not only did he not sit on a palanquin, he didn\u2019t even bring a servant girl along. The only one here was Ye Chuan, who was still hidden in the darkness like before.</p><br/><p>She had already noticed earlier how much better Baili Yu\u2019s complexion was. Now that she has noticed this as well, a bold guess emerged in her head. Could it be that this guy has recovered from his illness?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why his past languishness was brushed away in one sweep?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I go with you? After you win the contest, you can immediately return the money to me. Isn\u2019t this a good idea?\u201d There were two goals to this idea. First was its actual intention and second was that she could shake off Baili Yu. After all, she was heading off with Lou Qingyun, it\u2019s not like Baili Yu would keep following them, right?</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun considered it, then said, \u201cAlright. You can just head over with me. That way, you can also help me prove that this lamp was sold and that I didn\u2019t call someone to bring me money from home after getting thrown out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was also pretty happy that the idea took off. She moved up to pat Lou Qingyun\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Baili gongzi?\u201d Lou Qingyun suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>The moment these words came out, Tang Doudou itched to fling a slap at him. Couldn\u2019t you have just ignored this evil spirit?</p><br/><p>What if he decides to go along now that you\u2019ve asked him?</p><br/><p>In reality, Lou Qingyun was only being polite in asking Baili Yu. If it was someone else, he might have been able to ignore them, but this was Baili Yu. If he didn\u2019t improve his attitude a little and Baili Yu ended up becoming displeased, the Huai City Lou family would probably be wiped off the records of this Wind Spirit Imperial Court.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? Of course I\u2019ll be going with Xueyi.\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know if it was her senses playing a trick, but a strange light seemed to flash in Baili Yu\u2019s peach blossom eyes when he said this.</p><br/><p>The feeling that something wasn\u2019t right once again bubbled up in Tang Doudou\u2019s heart. Why did she seem to feel that something wasn\u2019t right the more she looked at Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>But no matter how she thought about it, she couldn\u2019t pinpoint where the strangeness was. She could only pat her chest and tell herself that she was probably just excited from seeing the antique lamp and overthinking things.</p><br/><p>However, Baili Yu wanting to follow along was pretty troublesome.</p><br/><p>Lou Qingyun, on the other hand, didn\u2019t really care. Whether Baili Yu went or not had nothing to do with him. It was just that he discovered Baili Yu\u2019s gaze when he looked at this Alliance Head was a bit strange ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys moving?\u201d The moment Baili Yu finished speaking, he moved up, grasped Tang Doudou\u2019s hand and started walking towards the street.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou struggled for a few moments to get free and discovered that although he was not grasping her tightly, she could not struggle free no matter what she did. She couldn\u2019t help but become discouraged. She then turned around and shouted at Lou Qingyun, \u201cSurnamed Lou, are you going or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her sharp shout sounded extremely like a woman\u2019s voice. Lou Qingyun knitted his brows, a bit suspicious. He flipped open his fan and thought for a bit before following them.</p><br/><p>The three walked together. As for Ye Chuan who had appeared a little earlier, he already disappeared.</p><br/><p>They soon arrived in front of a courtyard.</p><br/><p>Once they arrived, Lou Qingyun stepped forward, pushed open the door and headed inside.</p><br/><p>The scene inside wasn\u2019t in particularly good taste. All sorts of feminine powder scents drifted through the air. Along with it came some clear yet hazy sounds of tender laughter, as if many women were teasing and playing around.</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou looked around, she felt a sense of familiarity. Once she walked up the familiar loft, she immediately made a huge realization. Wasn\u2019t this the place where the martial arts convention was being held the day she transmigrated over?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Alliance Head Li. Baili Yu had the martial arts convention delayed after you got injured previously and was rescued by him. But from what ben xiaoye knows, it has already been almost two months since that day. How come Alliance Head Li still hasn\u2019t convened the martial arts convention?\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere between the three of them was extremely strange. Lou Qingyun was seriously worried that he would be driven crazy by this stifling mood before he even got to his destination. Thus, he hastily looked for some topic to divert everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou only recalled this matter when he brought it up. As for whether it would be convening, she had discussed it with Xiao Bai before in the Alliance Head Residence. The conclusion was that as long as no one brought it up, they wouldn\u2019t convene for now. The main reason was because she had pulled up a little fib that day and said that the City Lord had handed down some good tasks. For the sake of avoiding people being noisy and wanting to find out what the benefit was, they had all purposefully made it vague and forgot about it.</p><br/><p>Now that Lou Qingyun brought it up, Tang Doudou rubbed her chin and said, \u201cOh, this matter isn\u2019t pressing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s true.\u201d Lou Qingyun didn\u2019t count as an authentic Jianghu person, he was just a gongzi ge (refers to a rich person who only eats, drinks, and play; a child that does not attend to one\u2019s proper duties.) who liked eating, drinking and playing. He wasn\u2019t clear on these matters and just went along with whatever Tang Doudou said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah, I was wondering who it was, so it\u2019s Young Master Lou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice that was seductive to the bones sounded in front of them.</p><br/><p>Looking over, all that could be seen was a well-rounded middle-aged woman walking towards them on the small road. Her face was tender and alluring, and she had a bit of transparent gauze draped over her body. As she walked, the magnificence in front of her chest was like rippling waves\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Qing, where\u2019s Yun Yan?\u201d When Lou Qingyun saw this woman, his eyes practically emitted wolf-like light.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman being addressed as Boss Qing laughed coquettishly before sighing. \u201cAiyo, Lou gongzi, you\u2019ve come a bit late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, has something happened to Yun Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! What are you saying? What could happen to her in this Rutaceae Pavilion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you say I came late?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, just teasing you. Let\u2019s go, we\u2026\u201d Boss Qing didn\u2019t finish her words before her jaw dropped in astonishment. She pointed towards the two figures behind Lou Qingyun and couldn\u2019t squeeze a single word out.</p><br/><p>Then, she stammered, \u201cLou gongzi, they, they\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, I\u2019m not too clear either. Aiyah, I don\u2019t care, ben xiaoye is off to find Lady Yun Yan!\u201d Having made it here, he could no longer suppress the desire in his heart.</p><br/><p>As he said so, he pushed aside Tang Doudou who was standing in front of him. \u201cHehe, Alliance Head Li, I\u2019ll return the money to you once I get back. During this time, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to wait here a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t mind and nodded. \u201cYou can go. Just remember to return the money to me once you get back!\u201d</p><br/><p>She replied rather straightforwardly, proceeding to find a random room and walked in. She sat down and got ready to wait for Lou Qingyun.</p><br/><p>Today, Baili Yu was like a stringed puppet. He spoke little with a tone that was abnormally gentle and slightly pampering. He also didn\u2019t make things difficult for her and didn\u2019t even ask her where that Blue Ice Essence Soul Stone came from\u2026 Tang Doudou\u2019s feeling that something wasn\u2019t right increased with time. No matter what, she couldn\u2019t match this current Baili Yu with the Baili Yu she knew from before.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, then I\u2019ll leave first!\u201d After saying so, Lou Qingyun cupped his fist and squeezed into the room to the side.</p><br/><p>The door closed with a bang. Tang Doudou rubbed her chin and turned to look at Baili Yu who had been silent this entire time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t hold back from looking at me anymore now that everyone has left?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Boss Qing called someone to send up tea, she withdrew and even closed the door behind her. Tang Doudou felt abnormally depressed at the possible hidden meanings.</p><br/><p>From the start it was already extremely dangerous being in the same room as this guy. Now that the door is even closed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything? What are you thinking? It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other, Xueyi, did you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Missed your great uncle! Tang Doudou rolled her eyes but still didn\u2019t speak. It was not that she was keeping her composure though, she just didn\u2019t know how she should put it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn reality, there\u2019s no need at all for you to say you\u2019re borrowing that money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours. I\u2019ll give you as much as you want. Isn\u2019t it too distant to say borrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Da hell!? What about that Alliance Head Command Tablet you shamelessly ordered Ye Chuan to take back!?</p><br/><p>She had made it fine-sounding by saying she was only borrowing it temporarily and was going to return it, but now he was saying something like this. Tang Doudou rubbed her forehead. What was with Baili Yu today?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

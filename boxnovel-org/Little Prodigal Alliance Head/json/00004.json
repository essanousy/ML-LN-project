A huge force jolted the chair, breaking it into pieces. Wood chips fell with \u2018plop plop plop\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou, who was sitting on the chair, was stupefied and fell with those wood chips to the ground. Thousands of grass mud horses* wildly trampled through her little heart. What the serious f*ck!? Where did this play get produced!?</p><br/><p>\u201cgrass mud horses\u201d is pronounced \u201ccao3 ni2 ma3\u201d, used as a substitute for \u201ccao4 ni3 ma1\u201d which means f*** your mom.</p><br/><p>She lifted her eyes to meet the cold eyes of the black-clothed man. There was no doubt that she would be split into two by that sharp knife if she continued to be a sitting duck.</p><br/><p>But she had already been scared silly, ok!? The two legs simply did not listen to orders anymore. All she could do was sit on the floor and foolishly stare back at that black-clothed man.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve agreed that it\u2019s an act, how did it turn into being real swords and spears!?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this too deceptive!?</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang Doudou fall to the ground, the black-clothed man closed in step by step. Lifting up the blade in his hands, he was able to chop down again.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s back was covered with cold sweat as she stared at the falling blade.</p><br/><p>WTF! Could it be that she, Tang Doudou, with her lifetime of illustrious name, must die a violent death?</p><br/><p>The door of the room was wide open. Everything in this room could be seen clearly from the attic that was perfectly diagonally aligned with this room.</p><br/><p>A man laid languidly on a soft couch, his exquisite slender fingers were covered by long silver-white sleeves. The candle light illuminated a trace of stunning beauty and splendor. He was unhurriedly twirling a jade tablet in his hand, seeming to be casually fiddling with it.</p><br/><p>Found a fitting picture for once!</p><br/><p>Jade Tablet</p><br/><p>The man lay reclined. His appearance could not be clearly seen, but just this trace of a silhouette was enough to tell of his magnificent style.</p><br/><p>His gaze, from start to finish, never moved away from Tang Doudou\u2019s figure. Seeing that blade swing down, his fingers bent slightly but then loosened again.</p><br/><p>It has finally come, after all this waiting.</p><br/><p>How could Tang Doudou possibly know that besides this group of black-clothed men, there was actually another person paying attention to each and every move that went on here? At this time, the blade was right before her eyes. She was scared to death, yet her legs failed to live up to expectations and refused to move even the slightest bit.</p><br/><p>Her forehead was about to ooze sweat as her eyes fixated rigidly on that sword. When the blade was only a few centimeters away she shouted, \u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-clothed man\u2019s hand paused in response to this sudden utterance. Confusion flashed through his eyes, but soon after, it was replaced by fierceness and the blade slashed down once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Li Xueyi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at that dazzling blade and was almost about to cry. Bastard* she\u2019s Tang Doudou ah! What Li Xueyi? She doesn\u2019t even have a feather of a connection with that person, alright!?</p><br/><p>This novel is like a crash course on slang and cuss words, lol.  (ya de) is a shortened version of  = raised by a servant which = bastard child/illegitimate child. It\u2019s not really cussing at him though, it\u2019s like remarking \u2018shit\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Li Xueyi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily nodded as if she was a chick pecking at rice. With matchless sincerity, she looked at the black-clothed man. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you guys have the wrong person. I\u2019m not some Li Xueyi, I\u2019m called Tang Doudou. Tang of the Tang Dynasty, Dou from beans!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Doudou?\u201d repeated the black-clothed man. Then he said, \u201cAs if I care whether you\u2019re a sweet bean or sour bean, all who show up here must die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sweet(tang) is a homophone of the tang in TDD\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>What the hell, how can you be so unreasonable! Tang Doudou glared angrily at the black-clothed man. \u201cTreating human life as grass to ravage at will, does the law of the land still exist!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-clothed man was speechless for a spell. He never thought the words \u2018law of the land\u2019 would actually emerge from Li Xueyi\u2019s mouth, the world was truly large to the point that nothing was too bizarre!</p><br/><p>Why wasn\u2019t he speaking anymore? Heh! He must have been intimidated! He\u2019s probably incapable of refuting?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou extended a finger to stroke her smooth chin. Her face was completely smug and she secretly giggled inside her heart.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the black-clothed man\u2019s eyes slightly lowered and he closed in once more. Tang Doudou who was rejoicing covertly completely did not have her guard up and he was able to clutch her neck. \u201cLi Xueyi, you know too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cough cough cough! Tang Doudou felt uncomfortable to death as he gradually closed his fingers.</p><br/><p>Know a damned egg! What did she know!? She didn\u2019t know a single thing, ok!</p><br/><p>The black-clothed man\u2019s fingers were like steel pincers. Tang Doudou pried at them like her life depended on it but couldn\u2019t get them apart. She could feel the amount of air going into her lungs decrease and her head felt uncomfortable as if it was about to explode.</p><br/><p>She chaotically waved her hands. During the struggle, she pulled off the mask of the black-clothed man.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

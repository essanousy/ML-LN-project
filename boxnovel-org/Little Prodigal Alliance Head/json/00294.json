Why are you wearing my brother\u2019s clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in red got up and started picking the bits of leaves off his clothing. After he finished, he elegantly bowed towards Baili Yiling, \u201cLady, this is our first time meeting. There are no grace or grudges between us, so why are you insulting this one that way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid damned bookish fool!\u201d Baili Yiling rolled her eyes. When she saw that Shen Moru was walking over, she paid no more attention to the person dressed in red and retreated backwards while shielding Tang Doudou. \u201cSister-in-Law, this situation doesn\u2019t seem good. We should run!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou approved of this suggestion quite a lot, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Moru seems to have really good qinggong. Will we be able to escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling\u2019s expression was resolute. \u201cNo matter what, we have to try. We\u2019ll just split up. After all, he can\u2019t very well divide himself, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As of now, this was their only available option.</p><br/><p>The two shared a look, then ran off in opposite directions.</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou had only taken a few steps when she heard Baili Yiling cry out in pain and curse, \u201cYou damned nutjob! What are you grabbing me for!?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou turned back around, Shen Moru was already standing in front of her. She gulped and said, \u201cShen Moru, you-. S-stay away!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, she was immediately sent flying back towards the valley.</p><br/><p>She saw that the person dressed in red had caught Baili Yiling with red strings. As Baili Yiling struggled with all her strength, she continuously sprouted curses.</p><br/><p>It annoyed Lan Jia and he shouted, \u201cStuff something into her mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>The person dressed in red laughed vulgarly and said, \u201cAh, this is embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he pouted and moved towards Baili Yiling\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling\u2019s expression stiffened, then she turned and chomped down hard on that person\u2019s face. Blood started spilling out between her teeth.</p><br/><p>The person in red had been caught completely off guard and was in so much pain he screamed like he was a pig being slaughtered. He hastily sealed Baili Yiling\u2019s pressure points, then slowly got his face out of her teeth. He wanted to rub the wound to ease the pain, but he didn\u2019t dare to touch it and just continued crying in pain.</p><br/><p>Since Baili Yiling\u2019s pressure points were sealed, she couldn\u2019t do anything but glare at him.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Tang Doudou had been backed into a corner by Shen Moru. Shen Moru wanted to grab the cloth bundle she was carrying, but Tang Doudou dodged his grip. \u201cShen Moru, if you want to kill me or flay me, just do it. However, I won\u2019t allow you to touch my things!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Moru closed in on her step by step. Dark hatred filled his eyes as he said, \u201cWhy would I kill you? Baili Yu has already died with that demonic bug and fell into the sea. Mu Ye has disappeared somewhere, so if the Saint Emperor and I want to cultivate, your Xuanyuan blood is the only thing we can use. If you die, where are we supposed to go to find the right blood? Behave and stop resisting. In exchange, I\u2019ll leave you a good-looking intact corpse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of everything he said, the only thing Tang Doudou heard was that Baili Yu had died with that demonic bug\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you said that Baili Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it impossible? No matter how strong he is, he\u2019s just a human. How could he compete with us, who have cultivator bodies? He should\u2019ve known his place and supported us, but he refused to and we had to sacrifice one of the rare few ancient demonic bugs that still existed in this world to kill him and make him fall into the sea\u2026 tsk tsk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s dead!\u201d How could he die!? Didn\u2019t he promise her that he wouldn\u2019t die? How could he die!?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu! How could you leave me behind and die just like this!?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was you! You guys killed him!\u201d Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t tell if this was heartache or something else, but she felt terrible pain. It felt so horrible she felt like dying.</p><br/><p>When Shen Moru saw that she was getting stirred up, he recalled how much she had injured him the past times and immediately stopped provoking her.</p><br/><p>If she ended up going into that state again, they have to waste a lot more effort to capture her.</p><br/><p>Moreover, since Baili Yu was dead, she was their only hope. For the sake of luring them over here, he even had to risk being eaten by the sea dragon to fish Baili Yu\u2019s clothing out of the ocean.</p><br/><p>Since Tang Doudou seemed beside herself with anxiety, she probably wasn\u2019t clear-headed enough to run around. Baili Yiling had also been brought under control, so he looked towards Lan Jia and said, \u201cSaint Emperor, if we delay any longer, the immortality pill will probably lose effect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me kill this person and I\u2019ll split half of the Xuanyuan blood with you!\u201d Lan Jia\u2019s voice was exapersated. He had no idea who he was fighting with. This person had suddenly popped up out of nowhere, and he also had incredibly strong martial arts.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Saint Emperor!\u201d This had been the sentence Shen Moru was waiting for, so he leapt up with a laugh and started helping Lan Jia fight that person.</p><br/><p>However, the moment he moved up, that person disengaged himself from the battle and landed next to Tang Doudou. He attacked that person dressed in red with a flick of his fingers, then pulled Baili Yiling over as well. \u201cLan Jia, you want to use my dear disciple to cultivate some dogfart spiritual energy, but didn\u2019t even greet me or notify me of it? Aren\u2019t you clearly asking for a beating?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

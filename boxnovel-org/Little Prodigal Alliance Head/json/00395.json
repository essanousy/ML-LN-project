The fact that he was able to talk this way meant that he was fine.</p><br/><p>She looked over and saw that Grandma Shen was still walking around the room and sighing from time to time. It seemed that she hadn\u2019t been able to think of another method.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sat back down on the chair. She saw that Little Gray\u2019s breathing was now very shallow and she couldn\u2019t help but panic. However, she didn\u2019t dare to express her impatience in worry that she\u2019d disturb Grandma Shen\u2019s train of thought. She reached out and placed her hand on Little Gray\u2019s head. There was nothing she could do right now except for silently encouraging him. Little Gray, you have to hold on!</p><br/><p>Little Gray, who was barely conscious, seemed to sense her thoughts and forced his eyes open. His eyes were filled with reluctance and soon dimmed again, but his hand moved. He seemed to use all of his energy in the motion of lifting his hand and pointing towards Tang Doudou\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows and hastily grabbed his hand. \u201cWhatever it is, wait until you\u2019re better to say it. Don\u2019t move around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she even finished her words, she saw the jade skull tip forward from her sleeve. A light bulb lit up and she whispered, \u201cWere you pointing at this?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she pulled out the skull and placed it in front of Little Gray.</p><br/><p>Little Gray\u2019s eyes filled with hope when he saw the jade skull and he licked it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like it? If you like it, I\u2019ll give it to you once you get better!\u201d Tang Doudou thought that Little Gray liked the skull. After all, why would he lick it if he didn\u2019t?</p><br/><p>The cats and dogs that she had fed before would lick the things they liked to express the fact that they liked it, so she thought that Little Gray was doing the same thing.</p><br/><p>Hence, she placed the jade skull even closer so that it\u2019d be easier for Little Gray to lick it.</p><br/><p>After doing this, Tang Doudou looked towards Grandma Shen and saw that her brows were becoming more and more furrowed. The sky outside was also darkening. Tang Doudou\u2019s heart sunk. It couldn\u2019t be that Little Gray would really\u2026</p><br/><p>If only she hadn\u2019t been pregnant. Then she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about hurting the baby.</p><br/><p>What to do now!?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was besides herself with worry and didn\u2019t notice that fact that Little Gray was gradually becoming stronger after licking the jade skull.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Grandma Shen who had been pacing this entire time finally stopped and sighed heavily. She looked towards Tang Doudou with regret. \u201cI was thinking that it\u2019d be a pity not to save the nine-eared monkey since it\u2019s a rare spirit animal, but it seems that the Heavens insist on taking back its life. This old grandma can\u2019t do anything about it ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words came like a death notice. Tang Doudou\u2019s limbs went weak and she collapsed into the chair behind her. Her eyes were dull as she muttered, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be like this, it shouldn\u2019t have been like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had only been hit by Bai Feiyun because he was trying to help her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt horrible, but she couldn\u2019t vent these feelings and they crushed her heart like a heavy stone.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin, who had been sitting near the window, came to her and placed a hand on her shoulder comfortingly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, Little Gray is a spirit animal. He knows that you tried your best, he won\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou looked up. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin gently patted her shoulder, then looked towards Little Gray with a slight smile. His almond eyes seemed to soften. \u201cI understand your kindness, and even more so, Little Gray\u2019s intelligence and cuteness. He\u2019s your friend. Just like me, he\u2019s a friend that you can\u2019t bear to lose. That\u2019s why, I\u2019m sure that Little Gray thinks the same way as I do. Death isn\u2019t scary, what\u2019s scary is to die alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t friends supposed to look out for each other? You truly care about him and he\u2019s also loyal to you. The fact that you had cherished him so much and was willing to run so much to save him is enough for him to die without regrets!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou asked softly, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201d Jun Xin reached out to touch her soft hair. He wanted to pull her into his arms to comfort her, but suddenly, his throat filled with a sweet taste and blood abruptly filled his mouth.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou immediately snapped out of her sorrows. All she could see was red. Her face and body was covered with hot moist blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Xin!\u201d Tang Doudou cried out in alarm and hastily grabbed Jun Xin who was falling to the ground. \u201cYou, what\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Blood continued to pour out of Jun Xin\u2019s mouth in frightening volume. He tried to suppress it with his inner strength, but found that it was no use. The poison had already exploded and was attacking his entire body along with his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Jun Xin gave a muffled groan, but then forced a grin. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Once I die, remember to feed me the revival pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you seem to be in so much pain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid woman, it\u2019s always painful to be poisoned. It\u2019ll be fine once you get use to it.\u201d Jun Xin reached out to wipe away the blood on Tang Doudou\u2019s face but found that he couldn\u2019t lift his hand at all even though her face was right there!</p><br/><p>\u201cWill the revival pill really work?\u201d asked Tang Doudou in a trembling voice. What if it didn\u2019t work and Jun Xin didn\u2019t come back?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

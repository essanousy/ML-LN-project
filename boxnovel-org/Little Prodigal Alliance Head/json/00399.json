She set them in the neighboring room and decided to wait for dawn before doing anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to rest a little!\u201d After doing everything, she pressed on her pounding head as she walked back to her own room. She glanced down at her belly. She was seriously exhausted from this unending day. If she didn\u2019t rest and something else happened, she wouldn\u2019t have the strength to do anything.</p><br/><p>When she saw Jun Xin lying peacefully on the bed without breathing, her heart clenched in pain again and her vision blurred slightly. Was he really dead?</p><br/><p>In this dizzy state, she eventually drifted off to sleep. Once her breathing became even, Jun Xin suddenly got up from the bed and turned to look towards Tang Doudou who had fallen asleep on the table.</p><br/><p>Confusion flashed through his eyes as he looked around. How did he end up back at Azure Water Valley?</p><br/><p>Did he just revive?</p><br/><p>He opened his hands, then touched his own face. He couldn\u2019t help but find this incredible. He had only found out the effects of the revival pill through rumors. In reality, he hadn\u2019t been sure that it would work either!</p><br/><p>However, from the look of things now, the revival pill had actually been real!</p><br/><p>He exhaled in happy relief. It seemed that he should take a trip back to God Firmament Hall sometime to see if he could dig up anything else like the revival pill to keep on hand for emergencies!</p><br/><p>The fact that he had actually managed to come back to life made him really excited for a while. After quietly celebrating, he jumped off the bed to walk to Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>He carefully carried her to the bed. After setting her down, he covered her with the blanket and tucked in the corners before sitting down on the side of the bed to daydream.</p><br/><p>He only understood a bit of medical arts, but he still understood that it wasn\u2019t easy to feed a person a large pill after they died. That was why he hadn\u2019t had much hope of surviving earlier when he died.</p><br/><p>However, he had survived.</p><br/><p>That meant that he had eaten the pill and she was the one that fed it to him. Jun Xin was smart and quickly figured everything out. His expression filled with excitement and he leaned over Tang Doudou. However, just as his lips reached Tang Doudou\u2019s cheek, he saw her tightly furrowed brows. Even asleep, she seemed so tired. His heart squeezed with pain and he slapped himself hard. She was already so tired, he shouldn\u2019t disturb her rest!</p><br/><p>Jun Xin sat back up and just quietly guarded her.</p><br/><p>His gaze was deep as he stared at Tang Doudou\u2019s face. He recalled how she had probably fed him the pill again and a nearly undetectable trace of warmth appeared in his eyes. Although he knew that it was a little shameless to think like this, he couldn\u2019t stop himself. Who asked her to be so likeable?</p><br/><p>He rubbed his lips. It felt like her scent was still lingering on them. He smiled again, but he didn\u2019t continue sitting there and got up to leave the room. He glanced down at his bloody garments and walked into a nearby room to get changed. After coming back out, he saw a person sneak in over the wall.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s eyes narrowed and in the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of that person.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d That person hadn\u2019t expected for someone to be here and reflexively screamed.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin recalled that Tang Doudou had just fallen asleep and hastily walked up to cover the person\u2019s mouth. Once he got close, he found that this sneaky intruder was actually Baili Yiling.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling also figured out who he was and indicated for him to let her go because she had something to say.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin let go once he found out it was her and asked quietly, \u201cWhy are you here? What about Plum Garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling rolled her eyes at him. \u201cIt was Big Brother who told me to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu?\u201d Jun Xin was taken aback. He had also been called here by Baili Yu. What was Baili Yu planning?</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling yawned, then looked towards the courtyard curiously. \u201cThis is the legendary valley of the godly doctor, Azure Water Valley?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look any different from a normal valley!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin glanced at her and asked, \u201cDid you see Baili Yu on your way here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother? Isn\u2019t Big Brother here?\u201d Baili Yiling\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCould it be that Big Brother isn\u2019t here? But he wrote me a letter saying that he was in Azure Water Valley and told me to come find him!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin saw her expression, suspicion flashed through his eyes. \u201cAre you certain that it was Baili Yu that wrote that letter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain! I\u2019ve seen Big Brother\u2019s writing in Plum Garden several times, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d mistake it. That vigorous calligraphy style definitely belongs to Big Brother!\u201d replied Baili Yiling confidently.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Xin inwardly remarked crap! He couldn\u2019t be bothered to explain things to her and rushed back towards the room Tang Doudou was sleeping in. He pushed open the door and looked up to find that the letter he had left on the roof beam was no longer there. His expression became even more concerned.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling who had followed him found his actions strange. Following that, she saw that Tang Doudou was lying on the bed. \u201cSister-in-Law!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin hastily pulled her to stop her from rushing over. \u201cShe just fell asleep, so don\u2019t bother her. Let\u2019s talk outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling pouted, but she recalled that Tang Doudou was pregnant and nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>They walked back out of the room and Jun Xin quietly closed the door. They didn\u2019t walk far and stayed under the eaves of the house. Jun Xin glanced towards Baili Yiling, then slowly said, \u201cBaili Yu never writes. All the calligraphy in Plum Garden belongs to someone else.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She decided that she had to quickly change the topic, otherwise, he\u2019ll definitely end up leading her down the wrong path. \u201cHave you heard about Cloud City\u2019s announcement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, Jun Xin came by in the morning and told me.\u201d Since Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t allowing him to move, he started behaving himself. He propped up his head with one hand and looked at Tang Doudou who was wrapped in his other arm. \u201cSu Yi\u2019s allowing Wife to leave with me then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not even Jun Xin knew about this, so how did he find out?</p><br/><p>When Baili Yu saw that she seemed puzzled, he reached out and flicked the tip of her little nose with a gentle smile and said, \u201cIf he didn\u2019t let you go with me, then how are we supposed to get married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet married?\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cSu Yi didn\u2019t say anything about that to me ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mention it?\u201d Baili Yu narrowed his eyes and seemed a bit angry.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rubbed her nose. She could still feel the warmth from his hand on it and she said, feeling slightly shy, \u201cLet\u2019s return to Huai City first and see. I really don\u2019t want to stay even a minute longer in this Cloud City!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, joy appeared on Baili Yu\u2019s face and he asked with a smile, \u201cYou can\u2019t bear to stay in Cloud City anymore because this husband will no longer be in this city?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou really wanted to say, \u2018wishful thinking.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough. Yeah, you can say that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, you\u2019re really naughty.\u201d Baili Yu softly pecked her forehead. \u201cCome, let\u2019s get up and leave this boring place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou quickly pulled him to a stop.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu looked back with a teasing smile. \u201cWhat? Wife hasn\u2019t had enough of sleeping with this husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit messing around!\u201d Tang Doudou glowered at him. \u201cAsk the servants to wait for me for a little while. I\u2019m going to look for Cang Baicao real quick. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you looking for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s to ask about the Hoarfrost Poison in your body ah!\u201d After saying that, she climbed out of bed and ran out. She didn\u2019t even give Baili Yu any chance to stop her.</p><br/><p>His little woman was always so concerned about him, but\u2026 was it possible to cure his poison anymore?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu pulled his hand from under the quilt and unfolded the embroidered handkerchief he was holding. The bloodstains on it were so conspicuous. He heaved a long sigh. When he had wanted to die, death had eluded him for such a long time. Now that he didn\u2019t want to, death was just a step away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Chuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much medicine do we have left?\u201d</p><br/><p>Helplessness flashed across Ye Chuan\u2019s face as he replied honestly, \u201cNot much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu closed his eyes. After being silent for quite a while, he asked again, \u201cHow many months will they last?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan sighed. \u201cThree, three months at most\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Three months, that was enough. </p><br/><p>\u201cYou can withdraw. When everything\u2019s ready, we\u2019ll depart. Let\u2019s not return to Huai City yet. Head towards the west.\u201d Baili Yu got off the bed. \u201cIs Young Master Jun already in the inn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate saw him leave with Lady Doudou a moment ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s eyes darkened a little. \u201cAre Feng Long and Yun Hai back yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Long\u2019s already waiting outside Cloud City, but Yun Hai seemed to have run into trouble, there\u2019s still no news from him.\u201d Ye Chuan reported. </p><br/><p>Blood Fiend Jun Xin, Blade Demon Feng Long and Godspeed Yun Hai were Baili Yu\u2019s strongest subordinates. However, aside from Jun Xin, who was often by his side, the others were rarely seen.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had summoned all of them to his side meant that something big was definitely about to happen. </p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Tang Doudou went to find Cang Baicao but ended up finding out from Bai Feiyun that Cang Baicao had left Cloud City by himself yesterday. It was unknown where he went.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s heart sank and she blamed herself for only remembering about the poison now and not coming sooner. And, Cang Baicao just had to have coincidentally left Cloud City right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai, he didn\u2019t even tell you where he was going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun explained patiently, \u201cSenior Cang already mentioned that he wanted to go out and see the world last time while we were helping treat your injury. However, City Lord didn\u2019t approve of it. That\u2019s why Senior Cang took advantage of the fact that the City Lord left Cloud City yesterday and ran away. The reason why I know he left was because when I went to deliver food to him, I found a brief note that he left underneath a book.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jesus ah, then what now?</p><br/><p>What if Cang Baicao ended up vanishing without a trace? Then, what would happen to Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>The more Tang Doudou thought, the more irascible she became. Suddenly, her eyes landed on Bai Feiyun. \u201cAhem. Xiao Bai ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say it, what do you need help with?\u201d Bai Feiyun knew what she was thinking the moment her eyes whirled. This was what you call tacit understanding ah! That little brat Jun Xin couldn\u2019t compare at all!</p><br/><p>However, she recalled what Jun Xin had said and hesitated for a while. In the end, she made up her mind and asked, \u201cXiao Bai, do you know about the Hoarfrost Poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

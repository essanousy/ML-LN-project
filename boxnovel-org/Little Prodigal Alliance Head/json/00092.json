The light in his eyes slowly darkened as he looked towards Baili Yu who was on Tang Doudou\u2019s back. \u201cThe carriage has been prepared and is outside. We can leave at any moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu nodded without speaking.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan felt it a little strange but didn\u2019t bother dwelling on it as they were in an urgent situation. He led Tang Doudou and headed towards the back door of the courtyard.</p><br/><p>After the door opened, all that could be seen was a carriage that looked quite ordinary from the outside. Tang Doudou laughed upon seeing that simple and crude appearance of the carriage. \u201cAiyah, the richest individual in the world, Baili Yu, also has a day where he falls to this point, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it all because of you!?\u201d Ye Chuan swept a displeased glare over.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, he brought it on himself. What does it have to do with this little uncle?\u201d Tang Doudou curled her lips and headed towards the carriage.</p><br/><p>She had to exert half a day\u2019s effort in order to place Baili Yu on the side of the carriage. \u201cF*ck, this is seriously tiring as hell. Hey, Ye Chuan, hurry and come help!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have matters to attend to, you take care of it yourself!\u201d After Ye Chuan finished speaking, he didn\u2019t even bother to glance at her before he jumped onto a roof and disappeared in a couple leaps.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Chuan, you damned great uncle!\u201d Tang Doudou saw that he left without even looking back once and was dumbstruck for a while before she muttered a curse at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu, your family\u2019s subordinate sure has a temper!\u201d She turned around to talk to Baili Yu but didn\u2019t see him anywhere. Tang Doudou hastily lowered her head to look around. Could it be that she moved too much earlier and directly shook him off onto the ground?</p><br/><p>She looked all over below the carriage and even laid on the floor to check, however, she still didn\u2019t see Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but be confused. What was going on?</p><br/><p>Creak!</p><br/><p>A sound came from inside the carriage and Tang Doudou reached out to pull open the curtain. She was instantly blinded by the items inside.</p><br/><p>Jesus ah, she never expected for there to be a different dimension inside the carriage!</p><br/><p>The decoration inside was extremely luxurious, completely different from Baili Yu\u2019s past style of simplicity. The complete set of daily supplies was especially confusing to Tang Doudou. \u201cAre you getting ready to spend the rest of your life on the carriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she shot her gaze towards Baili Yu who was reclining on fox fur.</p><br/><p>This guy hasn\u2019t spoken since she yelled at him. Could it be that he\u2019s angry?</p><br/><p>But from the looks of his smile, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case ah!</p><br/><p>She plopped her butt down next to him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to drive a carriage and Ye Chuan has left. What now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu still didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu shot her an expression of helplessness. He opened his mouth but then shook his head again like he wanted to speak but didn\u2019t dare to.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, why are you so petty? I was just saying it casually.\u201d Tang Doudou rubbed her forehead, speechless.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu sighed and still didn\u2019t speak. His eyes just filled with grievances.</p><br/><p>From the start, he was good-looking. His every smile and movement would tug on people\u2019s heartstrings. When he smiled he would cause people to feel as they were viewing the sunshine in a lovely spring. When he moved, his movements were as indescribably beautiful as those of a celestial\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Currently, his brows were knitted with a grieved expression. That, in combination with his pale face due to the injuries, caused Tang Doudou\u2019s heart to instantly clutch into a lump. Her tone softened. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry anymore, alright? Say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Is she coaxing him? Baili Yu\u2019s brows lifted and he finally spoke. \u201cWife doesn\u2019t like it when this husband is this obedient?\u201d</p><br/><p>Da fudge, this is called being obedient?</p><br/><p>\u201cStop playing around, let\u2019s talk serious business. What do we do now?\u201d Tang Doudou started to realize that whenever Baili Yu was around, she rarely had her own views and would always ask his opinion on everything.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu stretched his waist and yawned. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait?</p><br/><p>Wait for what?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou lifted the carriage curtain in confusion and looked outside. She saw that there wasn\u2019t even the shadow of a ghost around, so she asked, \u201cWe won\u2019t be in any danger waiting here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t worry? As if! Damned ghost! Tang Doudou sat back and stared at Baili Yu\u2019s pale face. Then, she licked her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Wife is hungry, there\u2019s a lot of food in this carriage. To stare at this husband like this, could it be that Wife wishes to eat this husband?\u2019 When he got to the end, his tone became abruptly deep and an ambiguous air instantly filled the entire carriage.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

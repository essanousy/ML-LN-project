The two of them just continued walking silently below that sarcophagus. Gradually, their footsteps seemed to sync with the knocking some that was coming from the coffin. Just as Tang Doudou was wondering if her soul would end up being pulled away, Mu Ye stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha\u2026 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tang Doudou saw that he had crouched down and immediately questioned him in concern.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye glanced up at her. \u201cThe way out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily looked down at the stone stabs below her. She saw Mu Ye curl his slender fingers slightly and knocked on the stone stab. After knocking a while, he uncurled his fingers and abruptly hit the ground with his palm.</p><br/><p>The stone stab broke like glass. Some long cracks had first appeared before they shattered into pieces to reveal the black hole beneath them.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye didn\u2019t say anything and just jumped down.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou saw that he had jumped down without hesitation, she gritted her teeth and jumped after him.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as far of a fall as she expected. It was only about a meter down, but because she didn\u2019t know how far of a drop it would be, she ended up falling on the ground. Before bothering to get up, she first cried, \u201cMu Ye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye extended his hand to her from the darkness. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sighed in relief and put her hand in his.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye helped her up, but didn\u2019t let go. \u201cThe ground is pretty uneven so don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he said this, Tang Doudou naturally grabbed his hand tightly and didn\u2019t dare to let go. \u201cWill we be able to get out from here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mu Ye replied bluntly as he pulled her forward.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently grumbled, then what did they come down here for?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye, you still haven\u2019t told me what was with those needles on your neck?\u201d The surroundings were quiet and Mu Ye also moved silently. Although she was holding onto his hand, she was still very scared so she wanted to talk about something to lighten up the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>In any case, Mu Ye hadn\u2019t told her not to talk.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye was silent for a while before he explained, \u201cBecause if you seal all five senses, you wouldn\u2019t die from suffocation if you fall into the water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if you encountered a man-eating fish\u2026 like that sea dragon? Isn\u2019t that too huge of a risk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this sea region, that sea dragon is the only marine type and it doesn\u2019t touch things that aren\u2019t alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say earlier that you hadn\u2019t thought you would fall here?\u201d Tang Doudou immediately found the strange part in Mu Ye\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s tone didn\u2019t change. \u201cI sealed my senses after I fell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you jump down?\u201d asked Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>At this point, Mu Ye stopped replying.</p><br/><p>His old habit still hadn\u2019t changed. If he didn\u2019t want to reply, he just fell completely silent. Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know what to do with him. It wasn\u2019t like she could treat him as casually as she treated Baili Yu. If she pressed him to answer, he might choke her to death. If she tried to throw a tantrum towards this ice cube, she might end up freezing herself from the awkwardness.</p><br/><p>She was about to ask about the other needles when Mu Ye squeezed her hand and warned quietly, \u201cSlow down your breathing and don\u2019t speak. Silence your steps as much as possible. If you have enough inner strength, don\u2019t walk on the ground. Don\u2019t make any sounds at all and hold on tight to me. No matter what, don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the first time he had exhorted her so much and so seriously, she couldn\u2019t help but become nervous as she nodded and replied softly, \u201cEn, I got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Mu Ye still seemed worried as he turned around and stabbed three needles into her neck. \u201cI only sealed your breath and sight. In a little while, no matter what you hear, don\u2019t panic, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s breath was sealed so she couldn\u2019t speak and could only nod to indicate that she understood.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Mu Ye grabbed her hand again tightly and slowly continued forward.</p><br/><p>At first, Tang Doudou felt a little awkward having him hold her hand and was extremely tense. However, she eventually noticed that inner strength was continuously entering her palm from his. She was confused but couldn\u2019t ask and could only observe as that inner strength circled around her body before returning into Mu Ye\u2019s body while carrying a hot energy.</p><br/><p>Every time it revolved a round, her body temperature would lower. Eventually, it was so cold that she felt like she was in a freezer.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a large robe was placed around her. It didn\u2019t take brains for her to figure out that it was Mu Ye\u2019s.</p><br/><p>She tightened the robe\u2019s collar with one hand. Although she didn\u2019t know what he was doing this for, she knew that he wasn\u2019t doing it to harm her. If he was, there was no way he would put a robe around her.</p><br/><p>It was still dark all around, but it wasn\u2019t pitch-dark. There were also rustling noises in the darkness that sounded like a lot of bugs were crawling around. Her sight had been sealed as well so she couldn\u2019t see if there were any bugs crawling around.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye seemed to have sealed his breath as well. Since he moved silently, the only indication that he was still there was the hand she was holding onto.</p><br/><p>They continued walking silently for about half an incense stick\u2019s time. Then Tang Doudou felt her neck relax and the darkness in front of her vanished. At the same time, Mu Ye stopped holding onto her. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked around. There didn\u2019t seem to be any change?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Mu Ye saw that her senses had been unsealed properly and turned around to keep walking.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou muttered about the strangeness to herself as she followed. After just a little while, she started hearing the gurgling of water. A wave of chill came from ahead. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Mu Ye had acclimated her with his inner strength earlier, she definitely wouldn\u2019t have been able to bear this chill.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

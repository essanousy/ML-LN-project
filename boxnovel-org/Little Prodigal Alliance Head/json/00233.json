Even Tang Doudou felt heartache for him upon hearing it. She shot Jun Xin a glare, then asked with a smile, \u201cThis one is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Long, Baili Yu\u2019s subordinate.\u201d Jun Xin slapped away Feng Long\u2019s hand again. He was very depressed due to Tang Doudou\u2019s glare.</p><br/><p>It was all Feng Long\u2019s fault!</p><br/><p>Feng Long?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou remembered now. Xiao Bai had told her once that Baili Yu had three strong experts under his command: Blood Fiend Jun Xin, Blade Demon Feng Long, and Godspeed Yun Hai.</p><br/><p>These three people pretty much shouldered the burden of all of Baili Yu\u2019s biggest secrets. There was no need to explain about Jun Xin much. Even if always refused to acknowledge it, he was Baili Yu\u2019s junior brother. Moreover, his identities as a Saint Envoy of the Saint Tribes and the Hall Master of God Firmament Hall were enough to stun the world if they were revealed.</p><br/><p>Hence, the other two who share titles with him, Blade Demon Feng Long and Godspeed Yun Hai, probably weren\u2019t simple characters either.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was Blade Demon Feng Long. I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting your distinguished self for a long time. Now that I\u2019ve finally had to opportunity to meet you, as expected, you are out of the ordinary. I\u2019m Li Xueyi, nice to meet you. Please take care of me in the future.\u201d Tang Doudou was conflicted for a moment over how to act but in the end decided to emphasize friendliness!</p><br/><p>Although the person was Baili Yu\u2019s subordinate, based on Jun Xin as a damned precedent, it was better to err on the side of safety. After all, Jun Xin didn\u2019t seem to have the consciousness of a subordinate at all. He had even once sent people to entrap and kill Baili Yu in Azure Water Valley!</p><br/><p>Since even Jun Xin, who looked completely harmless, could be so ruthless, the fact that Feng Long had such strangely bewitching eyes probably meant he could be even more ruthless than Jun Xin. It was best for her to humble herself a little. The proverbs put it well, one couldn\u2019t verty well reach out and slap a smiling person. She had flattered him so enthusiastically, so Feng Long should have a good impression of her!</p><br/><p>Things like first impressions are too freaking important!</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Feng Long greeted her respectfully in a tone that had no emotion. \u201cFeng Long greets Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>The word \u2018madam\u2019 made Tang Doudou feel completely awkward. She scratched her head, not sure how to respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour distinguished self? Stinkin\u2019 woman, how come I never knew that you could be so fake?\u201d However, right at this moment Jun Xin tried to rap her on the forehead. Luckily she had been prepared for it and blocked him in time.</p><br/><p>See? This demonstrated the importance of a first impression. If she hadn\u2019t met Jun Xin while pilfering food back then, how could he possibly dare to treat her so casually?</p><br/><p>When her thoughts got to this point, she glowered at him and said, \u201cButt-aged brat! This big sis dares you to try that again!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, if I did it just because you told me to, would I be losing face?\u201d Jun Xin crossed his arms and slanted an unruffled glance at her. His completely unbridled attitude was practically about to drive her crazy.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it seemed that she had once said something like this before.</p><br/><p>When she realized this, she became even more annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re admitting that you\u2019re a butt-aged brat?\u201d She looked towards Jun Xin gleefully. Lil\u2019 brat, you\u2019re still a little too inexperienced to try and fight with her.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin realized that he had fallen into her trap and his expression changed a little. Then he lifted his chin up arrogantly and humphed. \u201cThis young master won\u2019t lower himself to bicker with a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes, enlightened on how thick his skin was.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, that Feng Long had been staring at the two silently as they were talking. When the fact that he called her \u2018madam\u2019 earlier was added on, she felt uncomfortable all over. She couldn\u2019t help but feel that Feng Long was seriously weird.</p><br/><p>And this rotten brat Jun Xin as well! Why did he have to introduce a strange person like this to her?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he was trying to mess with her again?</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Doudou, why are you still here?\u201d Just as the atmosphere was gradually getting a little strange, Qing Yu ran over. She seemed very flustered.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shot a puzzled glance towards Jun Xin and saw that he looked confused as well, so she pulled Qing Yu and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yu opened her mouth, but then she realized that Feng Long was here and hastily greeted him. \u201cYoung Master Feng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yu only turned to speak to Tang Doudou after Feng Long responded with a slight smile. \u201cMaster was looking all over for Lady but couldn\u2019t find you. Right now he\u2019s in the inn and very angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was surprised. Hadn\u2019t she been standing outside the inn this entire time?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

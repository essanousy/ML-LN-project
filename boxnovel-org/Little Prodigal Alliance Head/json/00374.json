If she didn\u2019t step out now, she wouldn\u2019t be able to live with herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Wuming, you demon!\u201d The people next to the dead person was probably the dead person\u2019s peers because they glared at Shen Wuming with tears in their eyes like they wanted to rip him apart. If it weren\u2019t for the people nearby stopping them, they would\u2019ve already rushed at him.</p><br/><p>However, Shen Wuming just expressed contempt and disdain. He humphed lightly, then said in a righteous manner, \u201cTo uphold the justice of the martial arts community, killing when needed is the most effective method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how are you any different from the Demonic Sect? Who would believe in someone like you?\u201d The people that originally had some hope in Shen Wuming felt their hearts turn cold when they heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could something dirty like the Demonic Sect be mentioned on equal terms with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your conduct exactly the same as them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, whether it\u2019s right or wrong, I naturally have my own measure. It\u2019s not your right to judge.\u201d Shen Wuming laughed lightly, then slowly walked towards the people who were around the stone. His eyes were filled with murderous intent. \u201cYou guys also disagree with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>His intense murderous intent caused those people\u2019s faces to pale and they instinctively backed away.</p><br/><p>The reason why Shen Wuming could be so unbridled was because he had very strange martial arts. That couldn\u2019t even be called martial arts! They had no way to defend against his attacks.</p><br/><p>When it seemed that Shen Wuming was about to attack again, one of the people suddenly seemed to recall something and shouted towards Elder Yu, \u201cElder Yu! Could it be that you\u2019re going to just allow this demon free rein in killing whoever he wants?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Yu made to move, but a jade-like hand pressed down on his shoulder. He knew who it was without even turning around.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t understand why Bai Feiyun, who had always been known for his benevolent personality on the Jianghu, had suddenly became so cold and detached. In the past, he would bother him about every little thing that was wrong, but now that the martial arts community was being thrown into disarray, he was actually standing by and watching, and he wasn\u2019t even allowing others to get involved.</p><br/><p>Elder Yu couldn\u2019t understand it and Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t either. However, when she saw that hand on Elder Yu\u2019s shoulder, she couldn\u2019t suppress her anger anymore. She shook Xiao Yi off and kicked the door open!</p><br/><p>It was currently very tense outside. The situation was already an armed bow. When those people saw that Elder Yu wasn\u2019t moving, despair appeared in their eyes as well as deep hatred. They hated Shen Wuming, but they hated Elder Yu and Bai Feiyun more\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Shen Wuming seemed unconcerned and smug. What if there was the Jianghu? So what if there was a martial arts community? Weren\u2019t they still right in the palm of his hand right now?</p><br/><p>Everyone originally thought that another bloody massacre would occur, but the situation was suddenly interrupted by a loud boom! Everyone looked towards the door.</p><br/><p>The door had been kicked down. When the dust settled, Tang Doudou\u2019s delicate figure appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo kill on my territory, have you asked for my permission?\u201d Tang Doudou glanced coldly at Shen Wuming. She seemed like a completely different person. At this time, she emitted a shockingly baleful aura from her entire body.</p><br/><p>What was with her?</p><br/><p>Xiao Ren and Xiao Yi who had just eaten a mouthful of dust shared a glance, then shook their heads. They couldn\u2019t understand how Tang Doudou managed to suddenly emit such a baleful aura.</p><br/><p>Since she was the martial arts alliance head, she should be practicing the orthodox martial arts, so how come her aura was so dark?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren that were curious, everyone else present were also very curious.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Tang Doudou was oblivious to her own situation. She was just furious to the point that she wanted to kill someone.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s sudden appearance shocked everyone.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was the only one that exhibited no surprise. After glancing at her, he let Elder Yu go.</p><br/><p>When Tang Doudou kicked down the door, Shen Wuming who had been about to attack again froze in surprise. However, when he saw Tang Doudou, his smug expression was replaced by a very contorted and sinister expression, but it vanished after just a moment. He folded his hands behind his back and turned around. \u201cAlliance Head Li, you\u2019ve finally come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou walked slowly down the stairs and everyone moved to the side to open a path for her. However, when she got down far enough, she stopped walking and just stood there on the steps without even glancing at Shen Wuming. \u201cWhere did these cats and dogs come from? Their yipping and yapping is so noisy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he unbridled?</p><br/><p>Then she\u2019ll be even more unbridled!</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see who can be the most unbridled!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was already satisfied with the fact that she had managed to stop Shen Wuming from killing someone else. As for whether she would be able to successfully deal with Shen Wuming, that hadn\u2019t been something she considered.</p><br/><p>Her unbridled manner naturally infuriated Shen Wuming. However, he wasn\u2019t a normal person and didn\u2019t allow the anger to get the better of him. Instead, he got straight to the point and asked, \u201cAlliance Head Li, since you\u2019ve decided to hide yourself in this crappy place, does that mean you no longer want to deal with the matters of the Jianghu? If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll have to trouble you to give your position to someone more suitable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou continued to ignore him and looked towards the people near the corpse coldly. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Those people snapped out of their amazement and started running towards Tang Doudou while crying, \u201cJunior Brother Meng\u2019s death was unjust! Alliance Head, you must get justice for Junior Brother Meng ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was Shen Wuming! Shen Wuming is slaughtering the innocent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy pitiful junior brother ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wanted to kill us too! It\u2019s fortunate that Alliance Head Li came out just in time! Otherwise, we would\u2019ve already, already\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s expression gradually turned darker when she heard this and the baleful aura surrounding her became even stronger. The people who originally wanted to head over to support her couldn\u2019t help but back away when they sensed this aura and looked towards her in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had taken off the human skin mask and those worn-out garments right after she went in. Right now, she was dressed in a snow-white garment. As the autumn breeze blew past, the sight of her was like the untainted pure snow of morning. Her black hair was swept back in a simple ponytail and her sharp fringe somehow added an indescribable flavor. Her bright eyes that were below stray strands of hair were currently as cold as frost.</p><br/><p>It was just one simple standing figure, yet it seemed to be the container of inexhaustible power.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s eyes dilated and his heart started pounding. Wasn\u2019t this precisely her?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he had been wrong?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

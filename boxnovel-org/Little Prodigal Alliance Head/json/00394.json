This method goes against nature since essence blood must be offered as sacrifice. This will allow the nine-eared monkey to share your life energy. However, this method will also cause you harm. Are you certain that you want to do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Grandma Shen turned around and looked towards her solemnly.</p><br/><p>Essence blood? Harm?</p><br/><p>These were terms outside of her understanding, but she could tell from Grandma Shen\u2019s attitude that it wasn\u2019t a simple matter.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced towards Little Gray, then gritted her teeth. Just as she was about to say that she was sure, a figure suddenly jumped in through the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho!?\u201d cried Grandma Shen sternly in alarm.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou turned around as well, curious to see who would jump in through the window.</p><br/><p>When she found that it was Jun Xin, she greeted him excitedly. When she saw that his face had a healthy flush and he also looked unharmed, she sighed in relief. \u201cI just knew that you would be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Grandma Shen saw that it was someone Tang Doudou knew, she turned back around. \u201cI\u2019ll give you half an incense stick\u2019s time to consider it, so think through things well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The joy on Tang Doudou\u2019s face immediately faded again and she couldn\u2019t be bothered with Jun Xin anymore. She hastily walked back and looked towards Little Gray worriedly.</p><br/><p>She really should\u2019ve agreed without hesitation, but then in that instant, she suddenly recalled the child in her belly. It was only now that she recalled that she was a pregnant woman and that there was another life inside her belly\u2026</p><br/><p>If she ended up sharing her life with Little Gray, would that affect the child?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hesitated. She didn\u2019t dare to bet with the life of the child, but she couldn\u2019t just abandon Little Gray\u2026 With the addition of the child into the equation, she became completely stuck.</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin had returned to the courtyard but didn\u2019t see her, he started searching on the rooftops of Barbarian Mound Garrison. He got here just in time to hear what she asked and Grandma Shen\u2019s reply. When he saw that she was about to offer her essence blood to save that monkey, he immediately jumped down from the roof and entered through the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to consider it anymore!\u201d Jun Xin saw the conflicted struggle in Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes and answered for her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked towards him in confusion.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin continued, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to think about it anymore. Take that monkey and let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>He walked up to pull Tang Doudou, but Tang Doudou pulled back. Her tone was panicked. \u201cDon\u2019t pull me. If I don\u2019t save Little Gray, he\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Jun Xin glanced towards the table at Little Gray, then he looked at Grandma Shen with a frown before turning back to Tang Doudou. \u201cAre you an idiot? Is essence blood something you can casually give someone? And how could you believe whatever she says? Why don\u2019t you consider the details? Also, could it be that you don\u2019t want your child to arrive safe and sound into this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course she wanted that. If she could choose, she wouldn\u2019t do this either!</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t have time to think at this point. She had to save Little Gray!</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin saw the stubbornness in her eyes, he released her helplessly. \u201cI can save him. Do you trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course she trusted him!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a way!?\u201d When she heard this, she was happy enough to run up and kiss him! But then she soon calmed down and started wondering if Jun Xin was tricking her. To stop her from giving her essence blood to Little Gray, he was saying this to stop her from trying to save him\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t continue thinking along those lines and turned towards Grandma Shen instead. \u201cI believe you, but I want to know what method you have. I can\u2019t risk Little Gray\u2019s life. He had gotten injured because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was clearly saying that she didn\u2019t believe him. Jun Xin sighed. He only had an hour left to live, so he wanted to just spend some time quietly with her, but life never went as hoped.</p><br/><p>He smiled helplessly. Just as he was about to speak, Grandma Shen interrupted and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have much life left either! Why don\u2019t you hurry and try to save your own life instead of trying to snatch this old woman\u2019s business? You\u2019re seriously asking for death!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin was leading God Firmament Hall, he had encountered Grandma Shen and learned of her identity as the Heavenly Doctor. That was one of the reasons why he didn\u2019t want her to treat Little Gray. After all, who knew what she actually planned to do?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t trust any of the Seven Great Saint Tribes\u2019 people.</p><br/><p>But when he saw how worried and heartbroken Tang Doudou was, he sighed, then took a small black vial out of his chest. \u201cFeed this to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked at the black vial in confusion, then recalled what Grandma Shen said earlier and her expression became concerned. \u201cWhat happened to you? Why did Grandma say that you don\u2019t have much life left? And what is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat could happen to me? I\u2019m perfectly fine. She\u2019s just a blind old lady. How could you believe everything she says? I\u2019m telling you to feed it to him, so just feed it to him! Why do you like wasting time so much?\u201d Jun Xin impatiently tossed the black vial to her and said, \u201cHurry it up. I still have something else to tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at him and carefully opened the vial to tap out the black pill.</p><br/><p>The moment she opened the vial, Grandma Shen\u2019s pupil-less eyes glowed with light. \u201cRevival pill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s hand froze. Grandma Shen then said, \u201cIf you feed this to the monkey, then that person will die for sure!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

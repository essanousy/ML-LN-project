Damn! Another beautiful man has shown up! Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes lit up and the anger at being bumped into instantly vanished. Smacking her lips, she suddenly felt that transmigrating to this lousy place wasn\u2019t so bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Li, the Martial Arts Convention is almost about to start. We should hurry and head to the lobby to manage the convention arrangements!\u201d In regards to Tang Doudou\u2019s strange words and language, Bai Feiyun\u2019s eyebrows knitted for a moment with suspicion, but in a blink, the expression was gone. His jade ink-like eyes fixed on Tang Doudou and he gave a faint smile, but there was still a slight peculiar tone contained in his words.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou naturally noticed it and looked at Bai Feiyun, her clear water-like eyes not even shifting in the slightest. \u201cMartial Arts Convention?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh my god!</p><br/><p>Hosting a Martial Arts Convention in a brothel! The people of the ancient era sure know how to play ah!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gaped and closed her mouth, mulling over the meaning in this antique lady-killer\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The first sentence, what are you thinking about? A stranger wouldn\u2019t suddenly ask this, and it\u2019s even more unlikely that they would approach this much before making a sound. From this, it can be inferred that this person was probably well acquainted with Li Xueyi, and their relationship was even pretty good.</p><br/><p>The second sentence, asking what driving distance meant, without minding in the slightest that string of ruthless curses she sprouted. From this, it can be seen that their previous interactions were also of this style.</p><br/><p>The third sentence, that\u2019s especially important.</p><br/><p>Martial Arts Convention, manage\u2026 Then that means if she headed in that direction she definitely wouldn\u2019t encounter black-clothed men?</p><br/><p>A divine light flashed. Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t suppress the excitement in her heart. She rushed to Bai Feiyun\u2019s front while sticking close to the tree trunk behind her back and lifted her eyebrows, \u201cLittle handsome, which way is the lobby?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was startled by her abrupt movements and his brows jumped. It was good that he had a cool-headed personality and so was able to resist the instinct to send the person in front of him flying with a swat. He evaded Tang Doudou\u2019s fervent gaze and replied with a mild tone, \u201cGo straight left then turn right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haha, there were so many people at the Martial Arts Convention, there was no way those black-clothed men would pursue her there to kill her!</p><br/><p>Having found a safe direction and having also gotten to eat an antique handsome guy\u2019s tofu while at it, Tang Doudou\u2019s mood became quite good. Smiling with curved eyes, she thanked Bai Feiyun and turned away, then headed leisurely and carefully into the quiet alley to the left side while humming an unknown tune.</p><br/><p>The antique handsome guy and Li Xueyi knew each other, so he definitely wouldn\u2019t give out random directions. Due to this assumption, Tang Doudou entered the small alley without the slightest hesitation. Upon seeing this, Bai Feiyun\u2019s clear pupils flickered as he fixed his clothes. Such strange behavior, what\u2019s going on with him?</p><br/><p>Right now, he also couldn\u2019t afford to waste time thinking too much about unrelated things. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to finally find this person, how could he let him say leave and just leave?</p><br/><p>Thinking to this point, Bai Feiyun moved, and in a flash, got in front of Tang Doudou. Fortunately, Tang Doudou was paying attention; when she saw a white shadow flash past the corners of her eyes she immediately came to a halt. A pair of liquid pupils looked with puzzlement at the antique handsome guy in front of her. What is he blocking her path for? It couldn\u2019t be that he still wants to let her eat his tofu?</p><br/><p>Wah, the tastes of people in ancient times are pretty strong.</p><br/><p>But if he really lets her eat tofu, would it be better if she was a bit more reserved, or should she be a bit more bold and unrestrained? Refuse? Or\u2026 calmly accept? But in such a public place with so many people\u2026E/N</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Brother Li planning on heading to?\u201d Bai Feiyun stretched out his hand to block Tang Doudou\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>Hearing the clean crisp voice, Tang Doudou immediately waved away the unhealthy images in her brain and replied, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say to go and manage the Martial Arts Convention?\u201d</p><br/><p>My god, the charm was too powerful, she must control herself!</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun slightly frowned and retrieved his hand, then asked Tang Doudou, \u201cHave you found the Alliance Head Command Tablet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alliance Head Command Tablet? What thingamajig is that?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s little brain just went over this question once and a deliberating expression appeared on her face. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t find it? Then that\u2019s bad.\u201d Though the words were full of pity, in actuality, not a trace of pity could be seen on Bai Feiyun\u2019s face. He said indifferently, \u201cEven though you\u2019re taking over the Alliance Head position on the command of the Lord of Cloud City, without the Alliance Head Command Tablet, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to convince the masses! Elder Yu also won\u2019t just let the matter drop like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you truly searched carefully for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mouth of the handsome guy in front of her opened and closed, yet Tang Doudou\u2019s brain wasn\u2019t able to turn around and follow along with his words.</p><br/><p>Have her go be the Alliance Head of the Martial Arts Circle? Isn\u2019t this joke being played way too big?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

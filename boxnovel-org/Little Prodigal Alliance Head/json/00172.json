He had agreed to the vow so quickly, could it be that he had some other trick up his sleeve?</p><br/><p>The more Mu Ye thought about it, the more he started to regret it. He shouldn\u2019t have agreed to the mysterious person\u2019s bet, but currently he had no other choice.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know that there were currently people betting on the battle between her and the wolf. She stared, completely focused on the wolf in front of her. The pain from all the wounds on her body was about to make her faint. When had she ever experienced such severe injuries before?</p><br/><p>And fudge, it would have been great if she knew just a bit of martial arts!</p><br/><p>It was all because she was too lazy most of the time. She should have already understood how important martial arts were after encountering so much danger, yet she didn\u2019t take advantage of her free time to learn a little. If she had, she wouldn\u2019t be in such a wretched situation today.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou made a resolution. If she managed to go back, she\u2019d definitely find a f-ing dozen martial art experts to teach her martial arts. She didn\u2019t believe that there was any way she wouldn\u2019t be able to become a pinnacle expert with her profound inner strength! (Pinnacle expert is currently the highest rank of experts introduced in this story. TDD has high goals, I approve.)</p><br/><p>She\u2019d like to see who would dare to kidnap her here and there in their free time then!</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, she had been gone for such a long time. Even Jun Xin had attacked the Imperial City out of worry, yet why hadn\u2019t she heard anything about Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he didn\u2019t care about her fate at all?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was very disappointed and frustrated.</p><br/><p>In the end, her distraction led to the wolf landing another injury on her shoulder. She gritted her teeth in fury, itching to just bite this wolf to death.</p><br/><p>Of course, the wolf also really wanted to bite her. It had never encountered such a difficult to deal with prey.</p><br/><p>However, the more difficult it was, the more interested it became. It bared its fangs at Tang Doudou as it barked at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re a dog? What are you f-ing barking for?\u201d replied Tang Doudou to the wolf\u2019s provocation.</p><br/><p>The wolf didn\u2019t understand what she said at all and gave another low hum. Then it started circling Tang Doudou as if it was about to use an instant kill technique.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had the same intention as well and gave a cold smile. Animal, since you\u2019re looking for death, I\u2019ll grant it to you!</p><br/><p>She secretly gathered up energy in one palm while reaching for the dagger at her waist with her other hand.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t used the dagger the whole time because she was worried about how intelligent these wolves were. In the past, she had seen a news report that talked about how a search team encountered a pack of wolves. When the wolves found out that the humans were holding dangerous weapons, they thought of ways to get rid of the weapons before starting their attack.</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, wolves had very high intelligence that were demonstrated in different ways.</p><br/><p>No wonder some places revered these creatures.</p><br/><p>Back then, because the scenes the report showed were too bloody, she remembered it abnormally vividly. That was why she didn\u2019t pull the dagger out from the very start. She was waiting for the crucial moment to use this in a surprise attack.</p><br/><p>The narration was slow, but the actual passage of time was fast. The instant Tang Doudou\u2019s hand made contact with the dagger, the wolf suddenly charged forward, forming a beautiful arc in the air and reaching Tang Doudou in the blink of an eye. Its sharp teeth were almost at Tang Doudou\u2019s neck when she suddenly leaned back. The wolf continued forward due to inertia as Tang Doudou pierced upwards. The dagger which was already in her hand entered that wolf\u2019s abdomen. Metallic-scented hot blood poured out over the dagger, dying Tang Doudou\u2019s hand red.</p><br/><p>Smelling the warm and disgusting scent, Tang Doudou hastily pulled out the dagger, rolled over, and rapidly got to her feet again as she looked over towards where the wolf fell.</p><br/><p>As expected of the alpha, though its abdomen was injured and blood dyed its white fur scarlet red, it still quickly got up from the ground. For the first time, actual fear appeared in its eyes. It retreated a few steps as it whimpered softly.</p><br/><p>Seeing that it seemed to be retreating, Tang Doudou said, \u201cYou should leave. If you don\u2019t bother me, I won\u2019t hurt you. You\u2019re simply trying to get food and survive, but I also don\u2019t want to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t knew if the wolf understood it or not. It whimpered softly, sounding very much in pain. More and more blood was flowing out from its wound. However, it forcefully kept itself upright, unwilling to continue to retreat.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou naturally knew why the blood flow was so heavy. It was because her dagger was special; its surface was full of barbs. After stabbing into the wolf and pulling it out, the barbs scraped the flesh as it left, causing a more severe injury than normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s won.\u201d When Mu Ye saw Tang Doudou put away the dagger, a smile appeared on his face. Perhaps he himself didn\u2019t even realize that it was there.</p><br/><p>However, Shen Moru didn\u2019t agree with him and said, \u201cWatch. Victory hasn\u2019t been decided yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Mu Ye frowned and asked, displeased, \u201cAre you trying to back out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeehee, I\u2019ve already sworn on it, how could I back out?\u201d replied Shen Moru.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wolf has already been injured, so hasn\u2019t she already won?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wolf has only been injured one time, but she already has so many wounds. If we really decide on the winner based on this, wouldn\u2019t it be too unfair towards me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust watch. The answer will be clear soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>From how wretch the wolf looked, it probably wasn\u2019t a threat to her anymore.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sighed in relief. She felt like her entire body hurt, but she didn\u2019t dare to keep staying here. Though the alpha had been injured, there were still so many wolves in this valley.</p><br/><p>As she thought to here, she forcefully roused her spirit and pressed on the deepest wound on her shoulder as she made to leave the valley.</p><br/><p>The instant she turned away, the wolf\u2019s originally weary eyes turned sharp!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

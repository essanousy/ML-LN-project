The Alliance Head Command Tablet must be kept, but it can\u2019t be kept this way!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou closed the box. When her fingers slid across the sapphire she used all her strength to dig it out, but that jewel didn\u2019t budge in the least. She could only give up.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Retrieving her hand reluctantly, Tang Doudou approached the palanquin and handed the box to the flute playing maid: \u201cThis gift is truly too precious. This Alliance Head does not deserve it and must ask Baili gongzi to take it back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She actually didn\u2019t want it?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Baili Yu chuckled, the low magnetic voice carried a hint of a smile as he asked: \u201cAlliance Head Li has truly decided?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This man is so long-winded!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes: \u201cThat\u2019s right, this Alliance Head has already decided!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cSo be it. Hope Alliance Head Li will not regret. Qing Yin, let us go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The words fell and the petals covering the ground once again rose up. It was vast and magnificently gorgeous.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then that palanquin in the middle of all the maids slowly rose and was about to float away again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Only then did Tang Doudou recall that she still hasn\u2019t handed the box in her hand to that maid called Qing Yin. Seeing Qing Yin was about to leave, she couldn\u2019t worry too much about other stuff and hastily reached out to grab the gauze shawl floating behind Qing Yin\u2019s body, urgently calling: \u201cLady Qing Yin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>How could Qing Yin have predicted that Tang Doudou would suddenly make such a move? The gauze shawl on her body started to fall, looking at it, it was almost about to expose her body. Qing Yin could only hurriedly pull it back. Her figure swayed and almost fell from midair.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Luckily, her neigong* was profound and she was able to soon stabilize herself. Her clear pupils swept over and saw that Tang Doudou was dragged up by her and currently hanging in midair.</p><br/><p>Neigong practice is normally associated with the so-called \u201csoft style\u201d, \u201cinternal\u201d or neijia  Chinese martial arts, as opposed to the category known as waigong  or \u201cexternal skill\u201d which is historically associated with shaolinquan or the so-called \u201chard style\u201d, \u201cexternal\u201d or w\u00e0iji\u0101  Chinese martial arts.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall, don\u2019t fall ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou tightly hung onto the gauze in her hand. Looking at the ground gradually getting further away, her palms and forehead became covered with cold sweat. Silently, she prayed that the quality of this gauze of Qing Yin\u2019s must definitely pass the test ah! Otherwise, falling from this height, breaking a few bones will be the least of it.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The incident happened so suddenly that by the time everyone was able to react, Tang Doudou had already been towed flying quite a distance.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>No one\u2019s expression changed more than Bai Feiyun\u2019s. He knew at this time that Tang Doudou\u2019s body had Tendons Softening Powder and that she had lost her martial arts. If that gauze really tore, a fall was definite.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Falling was a small matter, but for everyone to find out that Tang Doudou didn\u2019t have martial arts would be a big matter!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was just hesitating whether or not to catch Tang Doudou before the gauze tore, when a \u2018vvvrrirrp\u2019 sounded next to his ear. The gauze ripped!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was scared stiff. The ripping area was not far from her. The gauze slipped further and further away from her, she felt a never experienced before weightlessness. Tang Doudou was scared out of her wits. The rapid wind screamed next to her ear and she subconsciously squeezed shut her eyes.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Meowoo, this time she\u2019s really going to become a beancake!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing a person fall from mid air, there was actually no one that moved forward to catch Tang Doudou!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was just about to move up when a figure flashed past the corner of his eye. He paused the step he was about to take, a trace of suspicion flashing through his ink jade-like pupils.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>That figure effortlessly and gracefully moved past everyone\u2019s eyes. As far as the eye could see petals danced. A dark violet chang pao floated elegantly, unadorned black hair that was styled in a half up and half down style could be seen. Lightly swaying in the wind, that tall elegant figure was like a god that had descended to earth. Jade-skin glowed beneath the moonlight, a pair of peach blossom eyes glittered brightly with a river of stars. In it, the radiance of a thousand types of glass flickered. His appearance was like those of characters in paintings, even ten-thousand words would find it difficult to portray the unique charm he gave off from his very being.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Under the moonlight he treaded upon the endless flower sea, like an immortal, like a yao*. In a moment he approached and with a stretch of his arms, the falling Tang Doudou fell into his broad arms.</p><br/><p>In general, if you\u2019re not involved with material matters and is like above it all and always calm, you have the temperament of an immortal. If you smile a lot and is seductive plus mischievous, you have the temperament of a yao. Both live longer than humans but most people cultivate to be a immortal. If you fall prey to your inner demons you become a yao that usually has to rely on other things to extend lifespan. In some stories, some people are born as yao as well.</p><br/><p>General looks as well:</p><br/><p>An exotic fragrance entered Tang Doudou\u2019s nose, her delicate nose tip slightly moved. Opening her clear glossy eyes, they met directly with a pair of smiling peach blossom eyes. The whirlpool of stars in those pupils almost completely engulfed her. Just this pair of eyes was already beautiful to the point of causing suffocation, how stunning must their owner be?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou stared in rapture, muttering: \u201cSo there actually exists such an otherworldly ethereal person on earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOtherworldly ethereal?\u201d Those pupils continued to carry a faintly discernable trace of a smile, as a languid deep voice softly transmitted over: \u201cAlliance Head Li has great talent (in literature).\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hearing this familiar voice, Tang Doudou finally found her senses again. Recalling the thrilling situation just now, her small face was painted white. She quivered as she closed her eyes again and asked: \u201cHow many of my bones broke?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She never thought that someone would come and catch her. Right now, she thought that she had fallen too hard and had gone into shock from the pain.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cLet this one count. This mmm, top and bottom, left and right, inside and outside\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Don\u2019t say anymore!\u201d Suddenly opening her eyes, Tang Doudou painfully pleaded: \u201cHurry and find me a medical practitioner! I don\u2019t want to be cut off in my prime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cMedical practitioner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you call doctors!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s languid voice stretched the sound out. Finally he changed the topic: \u201cWhy do you need to find a doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>All along, that magnetic voice contained a degree of a smile. Matched with his slightly upturned peach blossom eyes, it was extremely like a seductive yao.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Is this still a human?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou who was filled with worry about her little life, was once again dazzled by Baili Yu\u2019s smile and for a while couldn\u2019t quite identify north, south, east and west. Gaping and closing her mouth, she thought, could this be the so-called dying beneath peony flowers, even becoming a ghost would be outstanding?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looking at Tang Doudou\u2019s dazed sparkling pupils, it was absent-minded and extremely pitiable. In mid air, Baili Yu\u2019s faint dark-red lips slightly hooked, his chang pao flew upwards as he spun and landed.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Baili Yu retrieved his gaze and looked towards the crowd where Bai Feiyun was: \u201cIs there a doctor? Your Alliance Head da ren wants a doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>More scared than hurt, looking at the safe and unscathed Tang Doudou in Baili Yu\u2019s embrace, Bai Feiyun released a breath of relief. Returning to his tranquil and mild attitude, he stepped forward after hearing those words and cupped his fist: \u201cAfraid a doctor won\u2019t be able to be found for a little while. This Bai knows a thing or two about medical treatment, allow me take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>White Wind Manor\u2019s status was not ordinary. Other than the reason that it does business throughout the entire Jianghu, it would be because of Bai Feiyun\u2019s medical expertise.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Obviously, Baili Yu also recognized Bai Feiyun and knew about his extraordinary medical expertise. When he saw Bai Feiyun step out, he smiled with a rather unclear meaning but did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cMust trouble Baili gongzi to help this one put down the Alliance Head, so I can help check the condition of his injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Before Baili Yu could even react, the Tang Doudou in his embrace came to her senses again. She supported herself up with one hand pressed against Baili Yu\u2019s broad chest while her watery pupils swept over the surroundings. Then she waved her hands, kicked her feet, completely in good health. An expression of being pleasantly surprised appeared on her face: \u201cI\u2019m fine? This is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hahaha!!!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>There will definitely be good fortune after escaping from calamity. She was fine even after falling from such a high place, isn\u2019t this clearly showing that she, Tang Doudou, in the future will strike it rich!?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She smugly smiled for a while before feeling several strange gazes sweep over.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Reacting several beats slower, Tang Doudou finally felt that something was not right. What was that firm with a touch of softness thing beneath her hand?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She suddenly lifted her head, once again seeing that pair of seductive yao-like pupils.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Lowering her head again, she deliberated for quite a while. When she lifted her head again, Tang Doudou finally realized the extremely serious situation.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She was actually being carried in Baili Yu\u2019s arms, and was even being held in the princess carry position!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>At this time, the distance between the two was close to the point that they could feel the faint breathing of the other. Her hand was even exceedingly vulgarly pressed against the other\u2019s chest\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>And the most critical point is, she\u2019s currently in the identity of a man ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Baili Yu had his eyes lowered. Tang Doudou\u2019s marvelous expressions flashed through his eyes and he couldn\u2019t help but feel like teasing: \u201cAlliance Head Li, is the feel nice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Tang Doudou met that pair of eyes and felt as if there was a magical force. Unable to recall that feeling, her hand, as if demons and gods were at work, kneaded it a couple times before she truthfully replied: \u201cThe feel\u2019s very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Following these words, Baili Yu started loudly laughing with \u2018haha\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The stirred up unruly laughter vibrated against Tang Doudou to the point her heart shook. Recalling what she just did, her thick-skinned face turned completely red. Inside, she sobbed, this irritating seductive yao, I\u2019ll get you on the bed sooner or later!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang Doudou and Baili Yu joke around as if there was no one else present, Elder Yu was the first to be unable to bear it anymore and stepped out: \u201cSince Alliance Head is fine, please continue to preside over the convention!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>He could not help but worry ah. That Baili Yu actually had a contending status of equal footing with the Lord of Cloud City. In the past they had never had dealings, why would he suddenly appear here?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Two unrivaled men in this world both treated Li Xueyi favorably, what in the world is going on!?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>One Lord of Cloud City was already difficult enough, now there\u2019s an additional Baili Yu. Wouldn\u2019t it be that if his Alliance Head decided to stick in some wings, he would be able to fly!?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Elder Yu\u2019s rough voice was particularly ear-piercing: \u201cBai gongzi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was helpless. It seemed after Li Xueyi lost his memories, he became particularly infatuated with charm. Regarding this, he was also speechless.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyou! My waist feels broken! Tsssk\u2026\u2026 This is hurting this Alliance Head to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Just as Elder Yu called Bai Feiyun over, Tang Doudou also suddenly started screeching. With one hand kneading her waist area, she beckoned Bai Feiyun with her other hand: \u201cXiao Bai ah! Hurry and save me! It feels like my waist is going to snap off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Bai Feiyun approached and came to Baili Yu\u2019s front. His dignified gaze was currently examining Tang Doudou. Just from the few winks she sent him, he immediately understood.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either. My waist just suddenly started hurting, like it got crushed by a boulder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not worry for now, let me take a look first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then, he looked towards Baili Yu: \u201cBaili gongzi, please set the Alliance Head down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take a look like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThe injury is at the waist area, like this it\u2019s a bit inconvenient to examine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026\u2026\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s brows lifted, a trace of reluctance appeared in his long and narrow peach blossom eyes: \u201cThen I\u2019ll set him down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Though he said so, he did not move. Just as Bai Feiyun wanted to open his mouth to ask once again, Baili Yu suddenly gave a wave of his hand. That group of beautiful maids carried the palanquin and flew over, steadily landing on the ground.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Baili Yu lifted his gown, then flung his sleeves. His movements were completed smoothly in a single breath and he flew into the palanquin carrying Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bang! The palanquin door opened then closed in an instant, happening so fast that no one was able to clearly see what just happened.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>A gust of rather cold air sounded. Bai Feiyun\u2019s eyes darkened, he didn\u2019t understand Baili Yu\u2019s intentions at all.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Just as he was puzzling over it, Baili Yu\u2019s languid voice floated out from within the palanquin: \u201cBai gongzi, I must trouble you to enter the palanquin to examine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun did not reply as he deliberated whether or not to approach.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>He hesitated. Who in the Jianghu did not know that from a young age Baili Yu already possessed property and wealth equivalent to that of an entire nation. The person himself even had martial arts that had reached perfection. He did not enter the Imperial scene and did not like the Jianghu. His conduct has always been unexplained and outrageous.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>That Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin was the result of the world\u2019s most skilled craftsman, Gui Yun, using up all the most valuable treasures in this realm and a full five years, as he exhausted all his heart\u2019s blood to built.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After the palanquin was completed, when he brought it to Baili Yu, Baili Yu only gave a slightly satisfied \u2018good\u2019. From then on, other than him (GY I think), everything that approached the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin didn\u2019t meet a good end.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This matter could be known just by looking at the currently dumbstruck Sangfroid Prince Xi Qiuyue.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by Miyu, Proofread by Ocelot</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>Hehe, this is getting to the part I like.

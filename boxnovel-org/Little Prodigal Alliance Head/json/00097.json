The captivating aroma stimulated her taste buds like a hook and she immediately left the matter that happened a moment earlier back in Java Nation. She beckoned the old beggar. \u201cIt\u2019s done, it\u2019s done. Hurry and come over to eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Java Nation is a place two monks once sailed on the seas to reach. They risked their lives to get there due to their faith or perhaps to prove their faith. In the past, people in China believed that Java Nation was a non-existent country just like the Peach Blossom Spring (a hidden land of peace and prosperity) that Tao Jun wrote about. So when a person entrusts a person to do something and the latter does not carry out because they forget, they\u2019d often excuse themselves by saying they\u2019ve long forgotten the matter in Java Nation.</p><br/><p>As she said so, she split those fish into three portions. Two portions had the same amount while one portion had a couple more. Tang Doudou took out the refreshments box that she had brought from the carriage and packed the largest portion away carefully before handing one of the portions to the old beggar who was already sitting in wait.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat slowly, alright? At your age you have to be careful of the fish bones!\u201d As Tang Doudou handed the fish over, she seriously felt pretty rather unsettled by the old beggar starving gaze. She kept feeling that the old beggar might eat the fish clean without even spitting the bones out once she handed it over. Thus, she decided to exhort him a little.</p><br/><p>The old man curved his mung bean eyes and exposed a mouthful of yellow teeth. \u201cHehe, little yatou is pretty interesting. Don\u2019t worry, this old man isn\u2019t old to the point of being senile. I know to spit out the bones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, he couldn\u2019t wait any longer and snatched the fish in Tang Doudou\u2019s hands. Then, he started eating heartily to the side.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was seriously made speechless upon seeing the way he ate as if he was the reincarnation of a ghost that had starved to death. Didn\u2019t he just say he would spit out the bones?</p><br/><p>He was almost done with an entire fish, yet there wasn\u2019t a trace of half a bone on the ground.</p><br/><p>Though Tang Doudou was speechless, she was still quite worried about the old man. \u201cYou should slow down, there\u2019s plenty more here. Don\u2019t choke!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man didn\u2019t stop eating but he looked over and hastily nodded towards her. However, he clearly didn\u2019t take in Tang Doudou\u2019s words as the second fish was almost all in his stomach yet there were still no fish bones appearing on the ground.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was also thoroughly defeated. However, she saw that he was fine even after eating so many fish bones so she stopped worrying over it and picked up a fish as well. She ate absent-mindedly as she was still thinking about the incident with that old woman earlier.</p><br/><p>Who exactly was that old woman? What did she have to do with her? Why did that old woman insist on taking her life? Why had she been able to smack away that walking stick which had been filled was killing intent?</p><br/><p>Deep in Azure Water Valley, the one-eyed old woman that had fled from Tang Doudou looked around the surroundings in alert before finally darting inside a concealed mountain cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d The inside of the cave was pitch-black. The five fingers of one\u2019s extended hand could not even be seen. Although the old woman was someone vicious who had slaughtered countless people, she was still a bit afraid of this type of darkness. Thus, her voice slightly trembled when she called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, that woman\u2019s martial arts is very impressive. She had been able to break this subordinate\u2019s certain death attack with one strike. This subordinate thinks she\u2019s not the person Master is looking for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not her, who else can it be? Ben zun saw everything that happened earlier. It\u2019s not that her martial arts are impressive but that she simply saw the gap in your attack. That was the only reason that she was able to send your walking stick flying with a single, light strike. Prepare properly. We\u2019ll make our move once a good opportunity arrives.\u201d A cold, gloomy and hoarse voice came from the darkness along with the horrible sound of a heavy object chafing against something.</p><br/><p>After hearing this, the old woman\u2019s crooked back bent even more. \u201cMaster, that old man earlier\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t get involved earlier so he won\u2019t get involved later either. Don\u2019t worry and just carry it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to the brook, Tang Doudou and the old beggar had finished that pile of grilled fish. Tang Doudou patted her tummy and then laid down on the grass, using a grass stem to pick her teeth. The delicious taste of those grilled fish had delighted all her tastebuds, it was extremely refreshing. Even now when she recalled that feeling, she wanted to eat more.</p><br/><p>The old beggar patted his bulging belly and sighed emotionally. \u201cIt\u2019s been so many years since I\u2019ve eaten such delicious grilled fish. Refreshing. It\u2019s seriously way too refreshing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he used his toes that were poking out from his shoes to nudge Tang Doudou who was napping on the grass. \u201cLittle yatou, come with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, I still have to wait here for someone.\u201d Tang Doudou glanced at his exposed big toe and her stomach churned. F*ck! This stench was seriously too dat!</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be dangerous when that old woman comes back if you don\u2019t go!\u201d The old beggar didn\u2019t bother to elaborate much. After laughing with a couple \u2018hehe\u2019s, he turned and started walking towards the flower sea. \u201cThis old man has eaten your fish so it counts as owing you a favor. If you don\u2019t wish to die, then just come with this old man.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the sound of this old man\u2019s tone, he was definitely not a simple guy either!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou really wanted to just jab her own eyes blind. Why didn\u2019t she notice it earlier?</p><br/><p>The old beggar seemed as if he was strolling slowly, yet in a blink he had disappeared into the sea of flowers and became a tiny dot. Tang Doudou glanced around at the empty surroundings that seemed to give off a rather eerie atmosphere, then rolled up from the ground and ran towards the flower sea following the old beggar.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Upon seeing this, the old woman asked the person hidden in the shadows, \u201cWant me to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she made a killing gesture.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Since he\u2019s getting involved, it won\u2019t be that easy to obtain. Grandma Meng, you should just rest well for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>The topic shifted and the person in the dark said with a smile, \u201cJust follow our previous arrangement. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to obtain the answer we desire very soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>An exquisite antique lamp appeared in that person\u2019s lifted hand, yet not even its faint radiance was able to penetrate that darkness.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Bai gongzi!\u201d Just as he was about to walk out of the courtyard, the earlier peasant rushed up to him. \u201cPlease wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Liu.\u201d Bai Feiyun was originally going to leave right away but stopped upon hearing Uncle Liu\u2019s anxious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi, Family Head asked me to pass something on to you!\u201d said Uncle Liu quietly after he walked closer.</p><br/><p>A trace of puzzlement flashed across Bai Feiyun\u2019s face. If Bai Luoqing had something to say, why didn\u2019t she say it earlier and had to have Uncle Liu come tell him?</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head also has her own difficulties. Although Bai gongzi didn\u2019t grow up in the Bai family, you are still someone of the Bai family so you should empathize a little with Family Head!\u201d said Uncle Liu sincerely.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t speak. Bai Luoqing was full of schemes. Even if she had difficulties, she didn\u2019t need his empathy at all. Back then, Mother had also contributed to the Bai family with all she had, yet didn\u2019t she still end up that way due to their so-called \u2018abandon the small to preserve the large\u2019 ideology?</p><br/><p>Seeing that Bai Feiyun wasn\u2019t moved by his words, Uncle Liu sighed and started talking about what Bai Luoqing said earlier. \u201cFamily Head told me to advise Bai gongzi. This matter is already linked to the seven Imperial Courts\u2019 struggle, so gongzi should consider it carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just a warning?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun felt like this couldn\u2019t be it and silently waited for Uncle Liu to continue.</p><br/><p>As expected, Uncle Liu continued, \u201cFamily Head also said that if Bai gongzi could convince City Lord Su into agreeing to the Bai family establishing a presence in Cloud City, it would be fine even if you didn\u2019t agree to that condition. She will definitely think of a way to bring you back to the Bai family home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Luoqing\u2019s ambition was growing wilder and wilder!</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun inwardly smiled coldly, but on the surface, his expression was tranquil as always. \u201cAlright, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he left without turning back. Bai Feiyun\u2019s expression only darkened once he got outside. Bai Luoqing actually wanted to dip a finger in Cloud City, was she crazy?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not right. There was definitely some other element involved that he wasn\u2019t aware of. It seemed like it was time to return to Cloud City.</p><br/><p>It was also a good timing to bring him to see Cang Baicao. He would definitely know what was happening.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun walked out of the alley and was about to head to Bai Courtyard when he saw Jun Xin swaggering in front, eating a tanghulu happily.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t want to come into contact with Jun Xin, there was a chance that Jun Xin might encounter Li Xueyi so he called out to him.</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin saw him, he was also quite shocked and hastily swallowed the tanghulu to ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s Li Xueyi? Didn\u2019t he go looking for you? Why isn\u2019t he with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Bai Feiyun looked at him, confused.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin looked around, then pulled Bai Feiyun to the side of the road before asking quietly, \u201cHe was looking for you to ask you to check his poison. Didn\u2019t he head back?\u201d</p><br/><p>He definitely knew something!</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was certain that Tang Doudou\u2019s abnormal situation definitely had something to do with Jun Xin so he told Jun Xin about everything that occurred earlier.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s jaw dropped. His expression was incredulous and countless questions filled his eyes. How was that possible? Even if the bug heart was incapable of curing the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, it shouldn\u2019t cause any harm to her body!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this incident related to you?\u201d Seeing Jun Xin\u2019s confused and shocked expression, Bai Feiyun grabbed his collar and demanded, \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin pushed aside Bai Feiyun\u2019s hand. He was worried about Tang Doudou\u2019s safety so his tone turned very annoyed, \u201cNone of your business!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is none of my business, but I don\u2019t even know where he is right now! If something really happens, I\u2019d like to see how you plan to explain it to Baili Yu!\u201d When Bai Feiyun saw that Jun Xin didn\u2019t plan to reveal what happened, and when he thought about the fact that Li Xueyi\u2019s current conditions were unknown, he couldn\u2019t suppress his anger and moved up to grab Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>He had just reached out when Jun Xin swept past him; he didn\u2019t even see when Jun Xin had moved. A gloomy voice that completely lacked the aura of life transmitted over. \u201cI\u2019m going to look for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was shocked by Jun Xin\u2019s speed. Originally there wasn\u2019t a great gap between their martial art skills but just then he felt an extremely large gap as if Jun Xin\u2019s martial arts skills had already surpassed his by an enormous margin!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

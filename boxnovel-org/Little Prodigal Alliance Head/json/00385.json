Saving you was just a passing effort.\u201d Tang Doudou finally came back to her senses when Little Gray scratched her ear. She looked at the two that were currently exchanging passionate gazes for a while, then finally disrupted them. Even though she felt bad, she was really curious about this man\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s phoenix eyes were very deep but also very gentle. \u201cLady wishes to ask this one something?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was evidently very smart!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I just want to ask what your name is? What\u2019s your surname and given name? Where did you come from? Where does your family live? What kind of people are in your family\u2026 And, why were you here? How did you end up in the water?\u201d</p><br/><p>This outburst of questions would definitely offend any normal person since they were all asking about very personal things.</p><br/><p>However, this man seemed to have expected these questions. His expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest and he smiled politely, \u201cIt\u2019d take quite a while to answer these questions, so how about this? My house is nearby. Lady, why don\u2019t you come with us? Once I change out of these clothes, I\u2019ll answer your questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>His clothes were soaked and it was already late autumn, so the sun wasn\u2019t very warm. There was also a strong breeze by this lake as well, so although he was trying hard to control himself, he couldn\u2019t help but shiver\u2026 When Tang Doudou saw this, she nodded. \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, the girl called Yu er helped the man up and supported him while walking towards the forest next to the lake.</p><br/><p>When she moved over to help support him as well, she found that the man gave off an abnormally cold air.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t due to falling in the water, it seemed to emit from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one has a naturally cold disposition. If Lady feels uncomfortable, please let go. This one will be fine with Yu er\u2018s help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. She sprained her leg, so if I let go, both of you will fall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man turned to look towards Yu er in surprise. \u201cYou sprained your leg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu er said, \u201cBig Brother Baili, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d The man\u2019s pale face turned stern as he glanced down at her leg. When he saw how pale her face was due to the pain, he scolded, \u201cLet me go! I didn\u2019t let you come here to serve me! I didn\u2019t let you come here to suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Baili.\u201d Yu er bit her lips. She seemed to gather up her courage and grabbed the man\u2019s arm tightly. \u201cI really am fine. We\u2019ll be home soon. Once I get home, I\u2019ll immediately go rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu er, just let go. I\u2019ll help you support him.\u201d Tang Doudou saw that the atmosphere was getting tense so she tried to smooth things over. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good place to rest so Yu er, please endure it for now. Once we get to your house, I\u2019ll help you treat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she smiled apologetically, \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s also my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu er hastily said, \u201cDon\u2019t say that. The situation was urgent and you hadn\u2019t done it on purpose. It\u2019s just that Yu er\u2018s useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, let\u2019s stop talking about this. How much farther is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression softened a little after Tang Doudou spoke to ease the atmosphere. However, he pushed away Yu er\u2018s hands and looked towards Tang Doudou. \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you, Lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s no trouble.\u201d Tang Doudou said with a smile, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you guys to be so polite either, just call me Doudou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this benefactor\u2019s name is Doudou. It truly suits you well. This one is Baili Feng, this lady is Mu Qingyu. This one\u2019s residence is the nearby Flowing Clouds Manor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flowing Cloud Manor?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was pretty much certain that this wasn\u2019t a coincidence now. It was just that she didn\u2019t know what relation this Flowing Clouds Manor had with Flowing Clouds Palace, and whether this Baili Feng was related to Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d have to wait to find out the answers, it seemed.</p><br/><p>The three people and one animal gradually got further away from the lake. Once they disappeared from sight, a black figure appeared in the surface of the lake. Although the sun was bright, it couldn\u2019t illuminate this particular shadow so the figure\u2019s features couldn\u2019t be made out.</p><br/><p>However, that person seemed to be watching Tang Doudou leave with the other people.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a ball of faint blue flame shot towards him.</p><br/><p>Just as the flame was about to touch him, his body dispersed like a ripple and disappeared.</p><br/><p>When he reappeared, he was on the shore.</p><br/><p>He glanced behind him towards the flame, then his figure dispersed again. However, this time, he couldn\u2019t escape and was forced back by a red blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, and I had expected you to be so amazing. Who would\u2019ve thought that you\u2019d only amount to this.\u201d A mocking voice came from the forest.</p><br/><p>The shadowy figure looked over and saw that a handsome man was sitting on a tree nearby. One long leg hung down and swung slightly.</p><br/><p>It was Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>In reality, he had been following Tang Doudou this entire time and had also been following that mysterious person. This was already the second time he had shown himself, but Jun Xin still wasn\u2019t able to make out his features.</p><br/><p>There was clearly nothing concealing his face, but for some reason, his features couldn\u2019t be made out.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin lifted his brows curiously, \u201cWho exactly are you? Why did you lead her here? And why did you kill someone and try to frame Baili Yu? Do you have a grudge against him or something?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

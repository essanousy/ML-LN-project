Why would he be here?</p><br/><p>She walked back into the room and examined her human skin mask carefully. She didn\u2019t see any problems with it, so she went over to write a message on a piece of paper and put it inside the chest before putting the chest on a roof beam. After doing all of this, she finally left the room cautiously. Downstairs, she ordered some mildly flavored dishes, then sat down at a corner of the inn.</p><br/><p>Yun Hai was still there, standing in the very center of the inn.</p><br/><p>Of Baili Yu\u2019s three most trusted subordinates, Jun Xin and Yun Hai truly had extraordinarily handsome looks. His eyes were just like his name, mild and distant like a sea of clouds.</p><br/><p>He looked around the inn, then headed straight towards Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou noticed his movements, but pretended that she didn\u2019t see him and continued eating calmly even as her heart pounded nervously. Why was he walking this way? Could it be that he had recognized her? But he had never seen her before, so how had he been able to recognize her?</p><br/><p>Countless thoughts were flashing through her mind, but she continued to just drink the porridge spoonful by spoonful calmly.</p><br/><p>Yun Hai stopped about five steps away from her and sat down at the table next to her.</p><br/><p>Could it be that he hadn\u2019t been heading towards her?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t possible. There was no way someone like him would do something for no reason. The inn wasn\u2019t very full right now. There were a lot of empty tables in this large hall, but he had insisted on sitting down near her, at the very corner of the room. It was clearly done with a motive.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou finished drinking the porridge, then ate the steamed buns on the plate. However, she still didn\u2019t feel full, so she had the waiter bring up a tray of steamed dumplings. Afterwards, she handed the medicine that she had prepared beforehand to the waiter. \u201cWaiter, please help me make this medicine, then bring it to my room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, she handed the waiter some coins.</p><br/><p>The waiter left with the packet of medicine. As Tang Doudou retrieved her gaze, she noticed that Yun Hai was currently looking at her. However, she ignored him even as he seemed to continue to look at her. After finishing her food, she returned to her room.</p><br/><p>During this entire time, Yun Hai didn\u2019t do anything except look at her.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t stop her when she got up either, so it just confused her even more.</p><br/><p>Although she was puzzled, she didn\u2019t spend much time on pondering it since she had already decided to leave Green Maple City as soon as possible. As for Baili Yu, all she could do was try to contact him. However, he had already been gone for so many days, so she had no idea how he was doing right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuest, your medicine is ready!\u201d Knocking came from the door, followed by the waiter\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou opened the door. After the waiter handed the medicine to her, he handed her a paper note and a strip of cloth. \u201cA guest had me deliver this to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no need to guess. That person was definitely Yun Hai. From the looks of it, her identity had already been revealed.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t understand what it was that gave her away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>She went back inside and drank the soup, then slowly opened the rolled up piece of paper.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Yun Hai didn\u2019t know that she was illiterate ah!</p><br/><p>As she looked at the message that was half filled with words that she didn\u2019t know, she couldn\u2019t figure out whether she should be laughing at herself or Yun Hai. She put the note away as she chuckled, then picked up the cloth to look at it.</p><br/><p>She reeled with shock. T-this cloth! Wasn\u2019t it the fabric Baili Yu was wearing when he left?</p><br/><p>Her shock was replaced with worry. Could it be that Baili Yu had already fallen into Yun Hai\u2019s hands?</p><br/><p>She clenched her fists. Anger filled her eyes, then she took out that paper strip again, copied down the words she didn\u2019t know, and left the room.</p><br/><p>She soon came back, but her facial color was more worse than before.</p><br/><p>What Yun Hai wrote was that she had to get to Dream Mountain within three days, otherwise\u2026</p><br/><p>But how did Baili Yu end up falling into his hands?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t figure it out, so she could only burn the paper note for now.</p><br/><p>A trip to Dream Mountain was inevitable.</p><br/><p>Dream Mountain\u2026 But why Dream Mountain?</p><br/><p>Nan Maner and Mu Ye hadn\u2019t come back either. Could it be that something had happened to them as well?</p><br/><p>Originally, she thought that she could work through things slowly, but now the situation suddenly got very urgent. No matter what, it would take two days to get to Dream Mountain from Green Maple City. Even if she wanted to rush back to Huai City, there wasn\u2019t enough time to do so.</p><br/><p>If Yun Hai wanted something from her, why didn\u2019t he say it directly to her in the inn? Why was he having her go to Dream Mountain?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he also wasn\u2019t sure of her identity? Or could it be that he had other plans? And what was with Baili Yu\u2019s clothing?</p><br/><p>After resting for a little while, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t wait for the rain to stop and quickly packed up her things to rush to Dream Mountain. However, there was no way to get a horse right now in the city and she wouldn\u2019t be able to get to Dream Mountain in three days just with her qinggong.</p><br/><p>Just as she was panicking over what to do, she saw a woman leading a horse towards the inn.</p><br/><p>The horse looked to be very strong, so Tang Doudou hastily went over. \u201cThis lady, an emergency has occured at home so I need to hurry and make a trip back. However, the road is very long. An old woman like me will probably die before making it back on foot. Can you sell this horse to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>That woman looked very compassionate and her voice was very gentle. When she heard that it was very urgent circumstances, she directly handed the reins to Tang Doudou. \u201cAunt, what are you saying? It\u2019s just a horse, there\u2019s no need to talk about money. You should hurry and head back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Tang Doudou didn\u2019t bother to be polite and leaped right onto the horse. The movement was swift and nimble, nothing like the movement of an aged woman. A trace of suspicion flashed through the woman\u2019s eyes, but she didn\u2019t have a chance to think much about it since Tang Doudou had already rushed into the rain with the horse.</p><br/><p>After a blink, she was already gone.</p><br/><p>At this time, Yun Hai\u2019s figure appeared on the inn\u2019s roof. Fu Yunliu was standing nearby as well. Both of them emitted a faint light, which was actually a barrier made from inner strength to block the rain.</p><br/><p>Fu Yunliu laughed delicately and softly leaned towards Yun Hai. \u201cI thought she was clever, but it only took a cloth that we picked up and a few sentences to crack her disguise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Hai dodged her and said expressionlessly, \u201cPalace Head Fu, have you come to a decision about the collaboration I proposed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Yunliu\u2019s brows furrowed slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve said that as long as you help me obtain the Steadfast Prince, I\u2019ll help you without any conditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Hai said, \u201cYou say obtain the Steadfast Prince and you don\u2019t count that as a condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Yunliu giggled, then pressed a delicate finger on Yun Hai\u2019s chest. \u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t count. After all, I am the master of a palace. You want me to help you with such an important task in exchange for just a man? You\u2019re truly naive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Steadfast Prince isn\u2019t an ordinary man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how extraordinary, he\u2019s still just a man. In addition, although I like his temper right now, his looks really aren\u2019t anything special.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Hai glanced at her. \u201cThe Steadfast Prince\u2019s looks are nothing special? Could it be that you want Baili Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Fu Yunliu started laughing again. \u201cActually, the one that I want is Yun gongzi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Hai\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cI\u2019ll help you get the Steadfast Prince, but you shouldn\u2019t forget what you agreed to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my reputation is still quite trustworthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Hai didn\u2019t say anything else. After standing there silently for a while, with a slight movement, he left the roof and walked into the building opposite the inn.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The reason they had led Baili Yu over was clear: that person wanted to see them start fighting over Tang Doudou!</p><br/><p>It had to be acknowledged that the person\u2019s plan was very careful and extremely sinister!</p><br/><p>Su Yi reacted quickly. From the looks of it, Baili Yu was currently unaware of the fact that Tang Douodu had been injured. He immediately closed the door behind him and put on a smile. \u201cSo it turns out this is just a misunderstanding!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMisunderstanding?\u201d When Baili Yu saw him close the door behind him, he started walking forward step by step with the smile still on his face. \u201cSince City Lord Su is saying that it\u2019s a misunderstanding, then I\u2019d like to ask, what\u2019s the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth is obvious!\u201d Su Yi had also guessed that the person who had led Baili Yu over was likely the person that had injured Tang Doudou. Ever since Tang Doudou had gotten injured, he had stationed secret sentries all over Cloud City. It seemed that Baili Yu had just arrived so the person that had led him here probably hadn\u2019t gone far either. It was likely that person was even in the shadows watching this.</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou\u2019s treatment could not be put off so Su Yi decided to just get Baili Yu to leave first. As for that villain, since he had appeared where Baili Yu lived, there were definitely plenty of people that got a look at him. As long as he stayed in Cloud City, he would be caught sooner or later!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth is that Feng Wu had been with me this entire time, so how could she have the time to send people to pick a fight with you\u2026\u201d This excuse was very forced. Su Yi couldn\u2019t even convince himself of it, but he pushed on. \u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can go capture that person and we can all figure this out face to face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cSince there\u2019s a rule in Cloud City that prohibits the instigation of fights and there\u2019s currently someone breaking the rules, it couldn\u2019t be that City Lord Su plans to ignore the crime?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll immediately send someone to investigate this matter!\u201d From the start, he had been planning to investigate that person\u2019s whereabouts.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s smiled deepened, but no one could tell if he was satisfied with this or not. However, he wouldn\u2019t leave, so Su Yi started becoming puzzled. What else did he want?</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, if he didn\u2019t ask, the person didn\u2019t plan on speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, does Baili gongzi still have any other matters?\u201d Without waiting for Baili Yu to reply, he continued, \u201cThe sky\u2019s getting dark. If you have no other matters, I\u2019ll be heading back with Wu er to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>er2, the word for son/child when added as a suffix to a person\u2019s name conveys endearment. Usually used towards a child you are close to, or someone you\u2019re very intimate with.</p><br/><p>The meaning was very clear. People were planning to go rest now and regardless of whether or not you still have any matters, hurry up and leave!</p><br/><p>Feng Wu\u2019s face flushed when she heard Su Yi call her Wu er. She tried to shove him away while muttering, \u201cWho wants to rest with you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If this was during ordinary times, Su Yi definitely would have retorted, \u2018long sought for but never obtained.\u2019 (Aka, this was what Feng Wu had clearly been trying to get for a long time.)</p><br/><p>However, right now for the sake of making Baili Yu leave, he lowered his eyes to look at Feng Wu with a mischievous smile. \u201cI\u2019m talking about rest in pure and simple terms. Where have your thoughts gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHateful!\u201d Feng Wu lightly hammered his shoulder.</p><br/><p>Su Yi caught her soft hand and looked at her with a deep gaze as he lowered his head\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as the two lips were about to make contact, there was a movement at the edge of their sight. The person that had been standing in the courtyard was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d How well did Feng Wu know Su Yi? How could she possibly be unaware of the fact that he was just acting? When she saw out of the corner of her eye that Baili Yu left, she immediately pushed Su Yi away.</p><br/><p>She did like Su Yi, but what she had always wanted was his entire willing heart.</p><br/><p>Su Yi turned and glanced at the courtyard, then looked all around. Just as she had said, Baili Yu was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to hurry up and make Xueyi better!\u201d Baili Yu would find out about this sooner or later. At that time, if he raised a fuss, it\u2019d be troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you no longer have that thing, you won\u2019t be able to leave Cloud City anymore.\u201d Feng Wu\u2019s face was filled with worry. She would rather sacrifice her own life than allow Su Yi to be trapped in this city.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, haven\u2019t you been able to get out just fine?\u201d Su Yi didn\u2019t seem to mind at all. He laughed a little and headed into the room.</p><br/><p>Feng Wu felt very helpless as she looked on. The price she had paid to come out was not something small; she had almost died.</p><br/><p>However, she knew that no one could change his mind once he decided on something except he himself.</p><br/><p>Su Yi soon walked out of the room again and stood there in silence with Feng Wu.</p><br/><p>A while later, Cang Baicao came out as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Su Yi asked.</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao didn\u2019t speak and simply passed what was in his hands \u2013 which was a small water-blue vial \u2013 to Su Yi. \u201cI checked several more times earlier. Her lack of breathing is a symptom of suspended animation; she isn\u2019t really dead, so only a little bit of this can be used. Currently the situation has stabilized, but it\u2019s likely that she\u2019ll have a fever. It\u2019s best if someone keeps watch over her. As long as the fever recedes, there\u2019ll be nothing more to worry about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if the fever doesn\u2019t recede?\u201d Su Yi immediately asked the crucial question. As for that thing, he took it without paying much attention to it and casually tucked it in his chest.</p><br/><p>Feng Wu, who saw this from the side felt extremely speechless. For better or for worse, he was someone that was near a century old, so why did he still handle things like a twelve-year-old little kid?</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao nodded. \u201cIf the fever doesn\u2019t recede, then everything we have done earlier will be wasted effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat cut and dry!?\u201d Su Yi glowered. \u201cIf we use up all of that thing, would it stop her from having a fever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no use. The fever is unavoidable.\u201d Cang Baicao rubbed his forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going to rest for a while. Come call me once her fever starts!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was already the middle of the night. It wasn\u2019t only Cang Baicao that needed rest, Feng Wu was injured all over and needed proper rest as well.</p><br/><p>Su Yi chased the two off to rest, then returned to the room. Moving a stool over, he started staring at Tang Doudou without blinking as if he was afraid he would miss something.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like it was the first or second time he had looked after this girl. This girl has always had a weak body and would often get sick. He had never recruited servants because he felt it was troublesome, so he had always personally taken care of his and Tang Doudou\u2019s meals and everyday life.</p><br/><p>When Su Yi recalled these things, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Back then, he had felt that life was difficult, but now that he thought back, he felt like time had truly passed too fast. Back then, when Old Man Tang had brought her here, she was only that big. He hadn\u2019t even been able to carry her steadily\u2026</p><br/><p>Yet in the blink of an eye, she had already passed the age for getting married. After a few more years, the child she would give birth to would probably be as big as she was back then!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

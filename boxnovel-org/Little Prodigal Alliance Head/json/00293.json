After a while, Tang Doudou noticed that the surroundings were familiar. When they got to the mountaintop and she saw the endless mass of waves, she abruptly realized where this place was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did they come here!?\u201d Tang Doudou exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling asked, \u201cSister-in-Law, you\u2019ve been here before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou told her briefly about her experience falling down the Sacred Tree, then said, \u201cWe\u2019ve already ran such a long way but we still haven\u2019t seen your older brother. Could this be the wrong place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible, Xiao Qing and Xiao Yu are spirit animals. They\u2019re intelligent, they wouldn\u2019t lead us the wrong way.\u201d Although Baili Yiling said this, she also looked confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cYiling, you\u2019re not familiar with this place even though you\u2019ve been in Cerulean Mountain for so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the true forbidden grounds of Cerulean Mountain. It\u2019s guarded even more tightly than Lan Jia\u2019s secret room. With my martial arts, I had no way of getting here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, should we still follow? Those two eagles are flying above the ocean now. Could it be that they\u2019ve entered the sea?\u201d asked Tang Doudou as she pointed towards the eagles.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling had been distracted by her thoughts earlier, so she only took note of where the eagles were now. Her eyes widened in surprise and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s not right. If they were in the sea, the sea couldn\u2019t be so calm. And Xiao Qing and Xiao Yu are still flying forward\u2026 Could it really be that they\u2019re following the wrong thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a vicious sea dragon in the sea. Will Baili Yu be alright?\u201d Tang Doudou\u2019s face turned pale when she recalled that sea dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine! That sea dragon isn\u2019t a match for Big Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, her tone was uncertain so Tang Doudou became even more worried. It was true that the sea dragon wasn\u2019t a match for Baili Yu, but Baili Yu had to deal with Lan Jia, Shen Moru, and that demonic bug as well. That combination was definitely difficult to handle, so if he had to fight a sea dragon as well\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dare to think any further along those lines. As she gazed at the sea, her head went blank.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling also fell silent in worry.</p><br/><p>The two stood for quite a while before Tang Doudou finally broke the silence by declaring, \u201cNo! If he\u2019s alive, we have to see him! If he\u2019s dead, we have to see his corpse!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she started running again and reached the beach in a few moments. Baili Yiling followed after her and said, \u201cSister-in-Law, don\u2019t do anything rash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou ignored her and ran towards the sea. \u201cBaili Yu! Baili Yu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law!\u201d Baili Yiling moved up to block her way. \u201cCalm down, what if Big Brother isn\u2019t in the sea but you ended up getting hurt due to catching that sea dragon\u2019s attention? How is Yiling supposed to explain once Big Brother comes back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! I have to find him! What if he\u2019s waiting for our help? Yiling, let go!\u201d Tang Doudou had already lost all rationality so she wasn\u2019t taking in Baili Yiling\u2019s words at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t! Sister-in-Law, calm down and trust me once more. Let me try looking one more time. If they still say that Big Brother is in the sea, Yiling promises not to stop you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go look myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyah!\u201d Baili Yiling didn\u2019t know what to do with her. She bit her lips and said, \u201cSister-in-Law, I apologize in advance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, a white silk cloth flew out of her sleeve and tied Tang Doudou up like a zongzi before dragging her away from the sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cYiling! What are you doing!? Hurry and let me go! I need to find Baili Yu!\u201d Tang Doudou struggled as if her life depended on it.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling shook her head, then called the eagles down. \u201cAre you guys sure that the bug is in the sea? Why are there no traces of the bug passing over the beach?\u201d</p><br/><p>The eagles screeched, then returned to midair and circled as they screeched.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that the bug is in the ocean? But it didn\u2019t walk over, it was kicked down by someone?\u201d Baili Yiling furrowed her brows. \u201cWho was it that kicked it down? Was it my older brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>The eagles screeched in confusion.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling then said, \u201cOh, I forgot, you guys haven\u2019t seen my brother before.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that, she picked up a nearby tree branch and started drawing on the sand. With a few strokes, a remarkably life-like portrait of Baili Yu had appeared on the sand. \u201cHe wears a large red robe, has long silky black hair, and looks a lot like me. Have you guys seen him?\u201d</p><br/><p>After being tied up for a while, Tang Doudou had calmed down. When she heard what Baili Yiling said, she said wryly, \u201cEven a human would find it hard to understand that description, would they be able to?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Baili Yiling saw that Tang Doudou had calmed down a little, she said with a soft laugh, \u201cSister-in-Law, even if Big Brother really encountered a mishap, you shouldn\u2019t take it too hard. Otherwise Big Brother would definitely haunt me as a ghost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even at this time, she still had the mood to crack jokes? Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes were dim. She didn\u2019t feel like speaking.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the larger of the two eagles suddenly screeched, then rapidly flew in the opposite direction of the sea.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

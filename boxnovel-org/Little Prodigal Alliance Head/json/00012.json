Rather, it was Bai Feiyun that sensed it and glanced backward a few times. However, each time his attention was broken by the winks Tang Doudou sent his way. In the end, he could only turn back around with the mindset of refusing to look back even if he were to get beaten to death. </p><br/><p>In the end, was he really Li Xueyi or not?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Bai gongzi, why are you also here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walking in the corridors, the number of people around gradually increased. There were many people that smiled and gave greetings when they saw Bai Feiyun. For some people, Bai Feiyun would give a polite but alienated return greeting, for others, he would just move his gaze a bit and count that as a gesture.</p><br/><p>As they walked along the corridor and gradually got close to the end, Tang Doudou discovered something strange. They don\u2019t seem to recognize her at all.</p><br/><p>Even this middle aged man that cupped his fist in salute and came over didn\u2019t seem to know her. Even though he was very different from the rest, a flash of puzzlement also flashed through his eyes, as if he was very curious about her identity.</p><br/><p>This scene caused Tang Doudou\u2019s thoughts to spin uncontrollably spin towards a strange direction. Little Bai* couldn\u2019t be duping her, right?</p><br/><p>I just noticed that Little Bai is a modern way of saying pretty boy. Putting \u2018little\u2019 in front of someone\u2019s name is also a common way of calling little kids by a nickname. Bai Feiyun, being an \u2018ancient\u2019 probably doesn\u2019t know that Tang Doudou is calling him a pretty boy.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun only needed a single glance to tell what she was thinking. </p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t pay attention to it. Instead, he greeted that middle-aged man back. \u201cHall Master He.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hall Master is usually a title for a person in a sect with a management position. So it is likely that he has a teaching position or is respected as a master. Hall is as in teaching hall. And trivia, \u2018He\u2019 isn\u2019t pronounced \u2018hiiii\u2019 but \u2018h-urgh\u2019, stressing the \u2018ur\u2019 sound without the \u2018rg\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Bai gongzi currently heading to the convention?\u201d Seeing that Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t plan on introducing the young man next to him, Hall Master He also couldn\u2019t bring it up himself so he just casually brought up a random topic to discuss.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun nodded. \u201cHall Master He isn\u2019t heading over right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, I do want to head over. As a matter of fact, aren\u2019t I out here looking for Li Xueyi?!\u201d Hall Master He got angry just talking about this. Don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the head of the Cloud City\u2019s Lord, to allow Li Xueyi, that hedonistic son of rich parents, come to become the Alliance Head of these martial arts circles. From the start of the convention preparations until now, when it\u2019s already about to begin, not half a shadow of Li Xueyi was seen. Because of this, it caused the entire Jianghu to be very dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>Where exactly was the millennium fame of Cloud City? But no one dared to say anything and this martial arts convention was even held at a brothel according to Li Xueyi\u2019s wishes!</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun heard the discontent in Hall Master He\u2019s voice. His eyes flitted across Tang Doudou\u2019s blank face out of the corners of his eyes. In his heart, he told himself that no matter what, he must first properly complete the tasks the City Lord gave him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to look anymore, Hall Master He,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is this?\u201d Hall Master He asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou also wanted to ask, why not keep looking? Let them search ah! After they get tired out searching, it\u2019ll be easier for her to deal with them ah!</p><br/><p>Gaping and closing her mouth, she was just about to speak when another person ran over hastily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHall Master He, I heard Li Xueyi was attacked by people from the Demonic Sect and that his whereabouts are currently unknown. Right now, Elder Yu is gathering everyone to discuss a countermeasure, what are you still hanging around here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man hastily walked over, grabbed Hall Master He and immediately turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Hall Master He didn\u2019t have a favorable impression of Li Xueyi in the first place, having him be kidnapped by people of the Demonic Sect suited him quite well. To want him to go rush to think of an idea to save the person, how could that be possible?</p><br/><p>Throwing off that person\u2019s hand, Hall Master He shot a glance at the unperturbed Bai Feiyun and gave a light cough:.\u201dSyndicate Leader Liu, in any case, you are still the leader of a syndicate. Making such a fuss over little matters and acting like a coarse martial arts practitioner that knows nothing but martial arts will cause people to laugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Syndicate Leader Liu paused, stunned. Inwardly, he thought: he\u2019s precisely a coarse martial arts practitioner of the Jianghu that knows nothing but martial arts in the first place. Otherwise, do they expect him to learn from the scholars and intellectuals how to act all soft and refined?</p><br/><p>Then glancing again at his own five larges and three thicks* physique, Syndicate Leader Liu laughed as he said, \u201cHall Master He really likes to joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>The five large refers to the ears, shoulders, hands, buttocks and feet. The three coarses refer to neck, arm, and legs. Additional info in footnotes~</p><br/><p>And then, he finally saw the two elegant white-clothed youths standing at the side. \u201cThese two are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, come, come, let me introduce you!\u201d Hall Master He intentionally procrastinated, not wanting to go where Elder Yu was, and pulled Syndicate Leader Liu over. \u201cThis is White Wind Manor\u2019s Bai Feiyun, this is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Bai Feiyun\u2019s name, Syndicate Leader Liu\u2019s eyes lit up, almost on par with the way Tang Doudou looked when she saw a high-quality handsome guy.</p><br/><p>He passed Hall Master He with large strides and grabbed Bai Feiyun\u2019s hand. His ardent eyes were full of little stars. \u201cBai gongzi, do you still remember me?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

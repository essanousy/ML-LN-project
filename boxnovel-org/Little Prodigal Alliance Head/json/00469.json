He couldn\u2019t help but doubt them. Nangong Yan was clearly not breathing and her body was cold against his back. How could she still be alive?</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath is letting her off too easily!\u201d said Su Yi coldly.</p><br/><p>He Xiaoqin shuddered. This Su Yi was really scary. He wouldn\u2019t even let off a corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have so many useless things to say?\u201d Su Yi turned back and glowered at He Xiaoqin. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that I was taking that girl into consideration, I would\u2019ve killed you already. Shut up or else I won\u2019t be polite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi\u2019s tone was calm but it was filled with bloodthirsty frigidness. He Xiaoqin didn\u2019t dare to say anything else.</p><br/><p>Su Yi finally turned around, satisfied, and brought He Xiaoqin back to North Hara City.</p><br/><p>In Treasure Sea Manor.</p><br/><p>When Baili Yu heard from Su Yi that Tang Doudou had been pushed down Ten Kilometers Cliff, the rims of his eyes turned red. He glared at Nangong Yan who had been thrown on the ground in front of him as intense murderous aura emitted from his body.</p><br/><p>His handsome features were now so contorted it looked as if he wanted to rip Nangong Yan apart with his own hands.</p><br/><p>Su Yi stood to the side and said angrily, \u201cShe\u2019s not dead yet. Torment her to make her pay for everything that she\u2019s done! I\u2019m seriously about to be angered to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after Su Yi said that, he was lifted by his collar. He looked into Baili Yu\u2019s bloodshot eyes and demanded, \u201cBaili Yu, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop her!?\u201d demanded Baili Yu coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop her? What do you mean by I didn\u2019t stop her?\u201d Su Yi had never been treated this way by anyone before. He grabbed Baili Yu\u2019s hand to try and get him to let go.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how he struggled, Baili Yu\u2019s grip didn\u2019t loosen in the slightest. It looked as if Baili Yu wanted to kill Su Yi as well to vent his anger.</p><br/><p>Su Yi got angry. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even able to protect your own wife. How can you have the nerve to blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>These words immediately made Baili Yu falter. At the same time, self-blame filled his heart. If he hadn\u2019t gone to investigate Bai Feiyun with Bai Lianhua today, if he had stayed by Tang Doudou\u2019s side, how could this have happened?</p><br/><p>\u201cI warned you before not to get too close to that Bai Lianhua. From what I see, that woman\u2019s definitely related to this incident as well!\u201d Su Yi took advantage of this chance to fling off Baili Yu\u2019s hand with a cold humph.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that you\u2019d be able to protect the girl well, but she ended up constantly being injured even though she was with you. You\u2019re seriously a useless fianc\u00e9e! I\u2019m cancelling your engagement with the girl right now! From now on, you, Baili Yu, have no relationship with my family\u2019s Doudou!\u201d said Su Yi angrily.</p><br/><p>There was no way that Baili Yu would ever agree to have his engagement with Tang Doudou canceled. \u201cI refuse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think your refusal makes any difference? No matter what, I\u2019m the girl\u2019s master and can make the decision on her marriage. I\u2019m saying the engagement is canceled so it\u2019s canceled!\u201d Su Yi glared at Baili Yu. \u201cI really regret betrothing Doudou to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu couldn\u2019t be bothered to listen anymore. \u201cI\u2019m going to look for her. If the engagement\u2019s to be canceled, I want to hear it from her own mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already fallen to her death! How could she say anything with her own mouth?\u201d When this was brought up, Su Yi became furious again.</p><br/><p>However, no words could get through to Baili Yu anymore. There was only one thought on his mind, which was to find Tang Doudou!</p><br/><p>No matter where she was, even if she was in the Yellow Springs, he was going to find her and bring her back!</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, where are you going!?\u201d Su Yi followed Baili Yu out of Treasure Sea Manor. When he saw that Baili Yu was heading towards Ten Kilometers Cliff, he stopped following and rubbed his chin contemplatively. \u201cIt feels a little off. Could it be that the girl really is still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but think this way. After all, which time hadn\u2019t Tang Doudou\u2019s situation been that of certain death? However, she would always get through it safety.</p><br/><p>He had always joked that Tang Doudou\u2019s life force was stronger than even that of a cockroach\u2019s. Now that he thought about it, perhaps she would again avert disaster and soon appear to jump around in front of him again.</p><br/><p>He purposefully avoided one thought, which was that this situation was completely different from the ones of the past. The Ten Kilometers Cliff was deep beyond measure. Falling would pulverize a person\u2019s bones. No matter how strong her life force was, how could she survive with her body so broken?</p><br/><p>At the bottom of Ten Kilometers Cliff.</p><br/><p>Mist swirled around the bottom of the cliff year-round. It was impossible to see what the place looked like with the mist. All that could be faintly made out were strange grotesque black tree branches that were swaying slightly despite there being no wind.</p><br/><p>A sudden gust of wind swept away some of the hazy mist as a white figure flew down and landed on the ground. His spotless garments lifted slightly with his steps and stirred the mist, making him seem like a celestial who was walking on clouds.</p><br/><p>After a few seconds, he stopped.</p><br/><p>In front of his feet was a woman whose eyes were closed as she lay on her side, seemingly lifelessly.</p><br/><p>It was Tang Doudou, who had fallen down the cliff.</p><br/><p>Her expression was peaceful and she was covering her abdomen with both hands. She didn\u2019t seem to be breathing at all. The man dressed in white leaned over and tapped several acupuncture points on her body, then lifted her and gradually disappeared with her into the thick mist.</p><br/><p>The place became tranquil again.</p><br/><p>However, this tranquility didn\u2019t last long. A red figure appeared from above.</p><br/><p>That person had captivating features that seemed too beautiful to be human and his garment was forever the same brilliant red. It was Baili Yu, who had jumped down Ten Kilometers Cliff to search for Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>He quickly landed and looked around, then his gaze landed on the place where Tang Doudou had been lying earlier.</p><br/><p>He walked over quickly and found that there were several scraps of cloth on the grass. He recognized the fabric as the clothes Tang Doudou had been wearing. When he looked around, he spotted jade in the nearby underbrush.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that Tang Doudou\u2019s alliance head command tablet?</p><br/><p>After falling from such a high height, the mysterious tablet had already shattered into several pieces.</p><br/><p>These were enough to confirm that Tang Doudou had fallen here. But where was she?</p><br/><p>Could it be that she was fine and had left herself?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t possible. In order to accurately find Tang Doudou, he had jumped down straight from where Tang Doudou had fallen. As he fell, he felt like the air was ripping him apart. He was only able to land steady due to using inner strength to slow his descent when he almost reached the bottom.</p><br/><p>This entire matter was strange and Tang Doudou had also mysteriously disappeared. This fact made Baili Yu calm down. After thinking through the entire sequence of events, he concluded that Tang Doudou had probably been taken away by someone!</p><br/><p>Everything had been part of an intricate plan from the start. Every step had been in someone\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>Could it be Lan Jia?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t possible. He had been keeping an eye on Lan Jia this entire time. There was no way that he could\u2019ve done this.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu put the jade tablet away, then looked around before leaving the cliff.</p><br/><p>He had to go back and send people to search this entire cliff again. The person that took Tang Doudou had to have left some traces!</p><br/><p>Su Yi, who had gotten impatient from waiting in Treasure Sea Manor was just about to leave when he saw Baili Yu jump over the wall with a solemn expression.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t seem to be in too bad of a mood, so Su Yi went up curiously to ask, \u201cHow is it? Did you find the girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced at him, then told him the situation he had found.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone has taken her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already sent people to search.\u201d Baili Yu sat down and quietly sorted through his thoughts before looking toward Su Yi again. \u201cCity Lord Su, there\u2019s one matter that I\u2019d like you to answer me honestly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust ask!\u201d Su Yi\u2019s eyes whirled with a thought when he found out that Tang Doudou had been taken away by someone.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced at him again. \u201cI want to know who exactly Bai Feiyun is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeiyun?\u201d Su Yi looked at him in confusion. \u201cIs this matter related to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suspect that he\u2019s the one that took Tang Doudou away.\u201d Baili Yu told Su Yi straightforwardly what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>Su Yi snorted disdainfully. \u201cFeiyun has been with the four large clans helping all these last couple of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Just as Su Yi was retorting this, Ye Chuan rushed in and bowed towards Baili Yu before reporting, \u201cBai Feiyun isn\u2019t in the city lord\u2019s residence!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu nodded. \u201cContinue keeping an eye on that place. Have Feng Long head out with a team to find Bai Feiyun\u2019s whereabouts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is Feiyun?\u201d Su Yi watched as Ye Chuan left, then turned towards Baili Yu, unwilling to accept this reality.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu glanced at him. \u201cWhether it is or not, we\u2019ll know once we find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d Su Yi scratched his ear. He had pretty much watched over Bai Feiyun since his childhood. How could Bai Feiyun do something like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seemed that City Lord Su doesn\u2019t understand your own subordinate that well either.\u201d Baili Yu looked towards the distance. Ever since he came to the conclusion that Bai Feiyun was the one that had taken Tang Doudou away, he started feeling very uneasy. However, he himself wasn\u2019t sure what it was that was making him so uneasy.</p><br/><p>Su Yi sat down. After hesitation for a long while, he asked, \u201cFeiyun, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Feiyun and Gu Xun are actually the same person, right?\u201d asked Baili Yu suddenly.</p><br/><p>Su Yi was taken aback for a moment. Strange light flashed through his eyes. \u201cIs this your guess, or something that turned up in your investigation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had guessed it after what happened in Hibiscus Garrison. Afterwards, I sent people to investigate and confirmed the fact that Bai Feiyun and Gu Xun were one and the same.\u201d Baili Yu lifted his hand to reveal the broken jade tablet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter coming back from Cerulean Mountain, Doudou had fallen unconscious. Bai Feiyun had used a secret technique to wake Doudou up and tried to get the alliance head command tablet in your name.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen he killed Xiao Ren and Xiao Yi in Azure Water Valley and stole the thing hidden in the library.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot long later, he poisoned Doudou and almost made her lose her child.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Baili Yu listed all of Bai Feiyun\u2019s doings, Su Yi\u2019s facial color gradually turned grim. \u201cHe had probably attacked Doudou because he heard me talk to myself about the fact that Doudou wasn\u2019t Xueyi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has always liked Xueyi, but Xueyi never had feelings for him from the start. That\u2019s why, after you appeared, I hadn\u2019t thought much about it. Since the girl liked you, I decided to just fulfill you two. Before that, I had also asked him about it and he said that he was willing to follow Doudou\u2019s decision\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was thinking that way before.\u201d Baili Yu interrupted Su Yi\u2019s words and placed another item on the table. \u201cHowever, he was misled by Lan Jia and became sure that Doudou wasn\u2019t Li Xueyi, so he did the following things to find the true Li Xueyi. He never expected that these things had ended exposing his and Gu Xun\u2019s identities.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

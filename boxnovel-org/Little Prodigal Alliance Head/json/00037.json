Even though this food box keeps the food hot for a longer time, but Master likes eating the freshest hot meals. So usually, when situations like this occur, the food that Meng Yu brings over can only be given to them.</p><br/><p>Cough\u2026 it must be mentioned that the food Meng Yu makes is really delicious ah!</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it caused his saliva to almost flow out. But as the head, he definitely can\u2019t eat alone. And thus, Ye Chuan carried that food box off to find his brothers, filled with anticipation and expectations.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Not long after, panting sounds of \u2018haahoohaahoo\u2019E/N arose in the plum blossom sea. No sooner than one subsided, the next one arose, and mixed into it were even some occasional moans.</p><br/><p>The two in the pavilion were highly skilled martial arts practitioners; their ears were highly sensitive. Even though that sound was not large, it entered their ears clearly.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s cold pupils still didn\u2019t have any changes in mood, but he suddenly stopped speaking in the middle of his words. Picking up the tea, he lightly took a taste.</p><br/><p>As for Baili Yu, his expression was still as before, only the colors of his stunning pupils deepened slightly. Retrieving his gaze, he looked towards Mu Ye with a slightly apologetic expression, \u201cDiscipline wasn\u2019t good enough, has caused Sect Leader Mu to see something embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pavilion became quiet again for a while. There was only the continuous \u2018haahoo\u2019 sound echoing all around, particularly loud and clear.</p><br/><p>After a while, Mu Ye stood up, \u201cThis matter, allow me to consider it some more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was not satisfied with this result but it was clear that it was unlikely for them to continue to discuss this, so he could only nod and say: \u201cThe matter is quite major, for Sect Leader Mu to need time to carefully consider is a matter of course. It\u2019s just that time is tight so please do make a decision with all speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Mu Ye stood up and cupped his hand towards Baili Yu in farewell. He didn\u2019t wait for Baili Yu to call someone over to see him off and left the pavilion. His steps tapped the ground lightly as he flew off like an owl.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After he left, Baili Yu slowly lowered the teacup in his hand. His long and narrow eyes slightly contracted because it was he who had underestimated Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>In the sea of plum blossoms, Ye Chuan was crouched under a tree sticking his tongue out and fanning it. He wished he could just pull out his tongue and throw it away. It was seriously way too spicy!</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, did Meng Yu jie really make this?\u201d Another subordinate was crouched down to the side, also fanning his tongue like Ye Chuan. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but swallow his saliva. It was fragrant and spicy, painful yet delightful; this feeling was way too painfully irresistible.</p><br/><p>There were even a few more men surrounding that open food box. Their painful expressions were telling. Really want to eat ah, really painfully spicy ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaahoo\u2026 waste\u2026 waste of words\u2026 this was\u2026 haahoo\u2026 something I personally brought\u2026 haahoo\u2026\u201d Ye Chuan couldn\u2019t even hold back his tears anymore. At the same time, he also felt rather doubtful. What\u2019s wrong with Meng Yu? Master and this bunch of people at his side all do not eat spicy things. To make something this spicy, was it on purpose or was it because she didn\u2019t feel well and put in the wrong seasonings?</p><br/><p>Recalling Meng Yu\u2019s flushed face, Ye Chuan was sure it was because she didn\u2019t feel well. Luckily, this food didn\u2019t get sent to Master, otherwise it\u2019d truly be a disaster.</p><br/><p>He was dazed out while thinking when all of a sudden he felt something was not right.</p><br/><p>Why did those continuous sounds of panting suddenly all stop?</p><br/><p>Following that, the corners of his eyes swept across a trace of bright red. His heart went \u2018tha-thump\u2019, crap!</p><br/><p>With a \u2018whoosh\u2019 he stood up and endured the spicy taste in his mouth, \u201cM-Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d When he arrived, the entire group of people were crouching all over the place on the ground, each and every one of them having an expression of incomparable suffering. It was so much so that no one even noticed him even after he stood there for a long time. It applied even more so to Ye Chuan; if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he moved even closer , it was very likely that even now Ye Chuan would still be deep in thought.</p><br/><p>There were very few things that would cause Baili Yu to be curious, but right now he couldn\u2019t help but become curious.</p><br/><p>This group of subordinates were all personally picked and trained by him, what sort of pain and torment had they not experienced before? Even if they were stabbed by a blade they wouldn\u2019t even make a groan, yet right now all of them had this kind of expression. How could he not be curious?</p><br/><p>Seeing the curiosity that flashed through Baili Yu\u2019s eyes, Ye Chuan silently cursed, but on the surface he still reported calmly: \u201cMaster, everything is this subordinate\u2019s fault, I ask for punishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat fault?\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s pupils suddenly swept towards the food box on the ground and he asked: \u201cMeng Yu came? What food did she bring?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the deer meat was secretly eaten by Jun Xin, according to Meng Yu\u2019s usual practice, unless she made something even tastier than deer meat there was no way she would bring food over. Usually she would mourn for several days before starting to cook again.</p><br/><p>During those times, he would for the most part eat some fruits to fill his stomach.</p><br/><p>Hearing him mention Meng Yu, Ye Chuan\u2019s eyes lit up. It could even be said that Master was very indulgent towards Meng Yu. It was all due to Meng Yu\u2019s cooking skills that caused Master to be unable to stop himself from eating. Without the food that Meng Yu cooked he would rather just eat fruit.</p><br/><p>If he knew that Meng Yu got sick, he might even skip pursuing today\u2019s matter out of worry.</p><br/><p>Alright, this matter really was his fault.</p><br/><p>But the brothers didn\u2019t commit any wrongs ah, so after the matter was over he\u2019ll still confess to Master and take his punishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Yu seemed to have gotten sick. When she came over just now, her face was as red as a monkey\u2019s butt.\u201d Ye Chuan was very certain that Meng Yu\u2019s face at that time was much redder than a monkey\u2019s butt.</p><br/><p>If Meng Yu found out that her bashfully red face was comparable to that of a monkey\u2019s butt in the opinion of the person she liked, wonder what she would think?</p><br/><p>No matter what Meng Yu thought, the main point is that right now Baili Yu\u2019s mood was extremely bad. Wouldn\u2019t this mean that he had to eat fruit for a lot more days?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp her find the best doctor in Huai City.\u201d Baili Yu commanded.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan immediately nodded, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t have the intention to investigate them in the first place, not to mention he was still concerned about the matter he was discussing with Mu Ye earlier, so he just softly said \u2018en\u2019 and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaahoo\u2026\u201d Seeing him about to leave, Ye Chuan\u2019s heart relaxed a breath and inadvertently he couldn\u2019t stop his mouth anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s step paused, \u201cClose the food box and send it to Plum Pavilion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Haahoo\u2026\u201d Ye Chuan didn\u2019t even think and immediately said.</p><br/><p>The moment he opened his mouth there was another round of panting. It really was impossible to endure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan knew that he made a mistake earlier. After he said it he immediately half kneeled on the ground, \u201cMaster, please forgive me. It\u2019s just that the things inside this food box, Master cannot eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I eat it? Could it be that it\u2019s poisoned?\u201d Baili Yu didn\u2019t look at Ye Chuan, but rather, because of his words, became even more curious about the things inside that food box. Looks like the strange behaviors of this group of subordinates were very much connected with the things inside this food box.</p><br/><p>As he thought about this, he walked towards that food box.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Ye Chuan wished he could just rush over there and kick that box flying. Sadly, he didn\u2019t dare.</p><br/><p>And he could only watch helplessly at Baili Yu approached, bent his waist to pick up the food box, then open it with incomparable grace.</p><br/><p>Glancing inside, Baili Yu knitted his brows, a trace of puzzlement streaking through his ocean-like pupils. What is this?</p><br/><p>Red things that were made into strips? Made with shredded carrots? Is it sweet? Sour?</p><br/><p>The faint scent of fragrance was unique and exotic, incessantly taunting his taste buds. Baili Yu swept his gaze in a circle. Finally at the bottom of the food box, he found a pair of chopsticks.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Ye Chuan panted a sound, and still couldn\u2019t\u2019 help but warn Baili Yu, \u201cIt really can\u2019t be eaten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I disdained you guys, I would have had you all killed way earlier.\u201d Ye Chuan tried to stop him several times so Baili Yu\u2019s expression started to get a bit annoyed. He thought Ye Chuan was having qualms regarding the master and servant relationship and said moodily, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just eating the same dish, it\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t shared a dish before in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>This, this really isn\u2019t what he means! Ye Chuan wished he could just send himself a slap. How is his mouth this dumb?! If he truly said straight out that it was a hot pepper dish Meng Yu made, he was afraid Master would immediately punish Meng Yu\u2026 But if he didn\u2019t say it and Master ate it, then he\u2019ll definitely know that this is hot pepper and Meng Yu would still be punished!</p><br/><p>What should he do?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan was extremely torn.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t pay attention to Ye Chuan\u2019s internal struggle and picked up a piece of spicy strip. Meng Yu has fallen sick, so this may possibly be his very last bite of a dish. Maybe he should go to Azure Water Valley to ask that old man to help look at Meng Yu. Like this, perhaps she\u2019ll be able to recover faster.</p><br/><p>As he was thinking, the spicy strip had already approached his mouth.</p><br/><p>The rich fragrant spices attacked his nose, as if it carried a hook. If it weren\u2019t for the fact Baili Yu had strong self-control, he would have involuntarily swallowed his saliva.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he couldn\u2019t help but be curious. What exactly would this taste like? He felt that it was a bit familiar, and also very foreign. But the one thing is definite: it\u2019s very very fragrant\u2026</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s eat.</p><br/><p>The moment Baili Yu opened his mouth, everyone present held their breath. Their eyes didn\u2019t even blink as they watched that super spicy spicy strip slowly being sent into Baili Yu\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>The moment he closed his mouth, there was a brief stillness.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone wanted to cover their eyes and prepare themselves to receive Baili Yu\u2019s explosion of anger, he actually smiled. A spring wind brushing past a mountain type of smile, light and mild, \u201cMeng Yu\u2019s cooking skills really are just improving phenomenally, not bad, not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a few steps he walked to Ye Chuan\u2019s side, \u201cYou, are also very not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then he very lightly threw the food box to Ye Chuan. His expression once again returned to tranquility. It was just that those pair of peach blossom eyes were clearly starting to turn red, and they even seemed to be carrying some watery waves.</p><br/><p>It was a shame, but everyone present was completely confused by him so they didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>When they returned to their senses, how could Baili Yu still be waiting there?</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, Master seems to have praised you.\u201d Someone said.</p><br/><p>There was also someone that questioned it, \u201cMaster was probably speaking in opposites. Who doesn\u2019t know that Master fears eating hot pepper the most?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 How strange\u2026 It was that spicy, but Master didn\u2019t seem to have any reaction at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that he suddenly wasn\u2019t afraid anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not completely impossible. When I was little I was also afraid of eating spicy things, but just now when I ate this, it seemed like I wasn\u2019t scared anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who spoke first interjected: \u201cThis stuff is seriously good though. Why didn\u2019t Meng Yu jie ever make it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShoo, Master doesn\u2019t even eat spicy things, what would Meng Yu jie make this for ah!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did she make it today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Everyone went silent.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right ah, Master never eats spicy things. What did Meng Yu make this for? She had nothing to do so she looked for trouble?</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan stared at the spicy strips in his hand for a while, before faintly speaking: \u201cPerhaps, this wasn\u2019t made by Meng Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>To say this wasn\u2019t completely without basis. For one, Meng Yu was also born in Nanchuan so usually, other than sweet and sour, she wouldn\u2019t make dishes with any other taste, much less touch spice. Even though she had great culinary skills, she only knew how to cook in Nanchuan\u2019s local flavor.</p><br/><p>And it was precisely because of this ability to cook in Nanchuan\u2019s local flavor that Meng Yu was valued by Master. That\u2019s why, even if she got sick to the point her brain got muddled, it was still not possible that she would do something this stupid to destroy her own reputation.</p><br/><p>In addition, this food\u2019s taste was way too different from what Meng Yu usually makes. It seemed to be some other region\u2019s flavor. Cough\u2026 but from where he couldn\u2019t tell by the taste.</p><br/><p>And even more importantly, hot pepper isn\u2019t a seasoning that can be commonly found. It\u2019s not something you can just casually buy.</p><br/><p>Master doesn\u2019t eat spicy foods, so the kitchen never prepared this seasoning before. As the cook, even if Meng Yu is given money she wouldn\u2019t be able to buy this hot pepper ah!</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t Meng Yu who made it, then who was it that made it?</p><br/><p>Why would Meng Yu bring something that someone else made to master?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan racked his brain for a long time but still couldn\u2019t figure it out. What exactly was Meng Yu aiming for, doing this? At this time this moment, he can only stare at this box and silently send a prayer. Hopefully Baili Yu will, on the basis that this thing is out of the common run, not pursue it. No matter what, please don\u2019t investigate\u2026</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by Ocelot</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>Moral of story?

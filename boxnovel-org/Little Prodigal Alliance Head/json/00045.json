These words were only directed towards Tang Doudou and completely ignored Miss Bai.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going up ah? What if it\u2019s not Baili Yu in there again?\u201d Tang Doudou glanced at Miss Bai and recalled the earlier black dragon(unexpected mishap). If the person inside wasn\u2019t Baili Yu again, wouldn\u2019t there be another huge scene?</p><br/><p>Miss Bai remained indifferent as if the discussion between the two didn\u2019t have anything to do with her at all.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin silently criticized that Miss Bai was shameless, then expressionlessly stood to the side without responding to Tang Doudou\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou noticed that the atmosphere was a bit awkward and broke out a laugh, before asking: \u201cWill Miss Bai be going up with this one, or..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi is looking for Baili gege to discuss a matter so it would be impolite of me to disturb. I\u2019ll just wait here.\u201d If she went up right now, all that she\u2019d be able to encounter would be Baili Yu\u2019s cold expression, so it\u2019d be better for her to just wait here. It wouldn\u2019t be too late to go in after they finished discussing their matter.</p><br/><p>At this time, Qing Yin cast a sidelong glance at Miss Bai and spoke mildly: \u201cDoesn\u2019t Miss Bai need to see Master for something? You should just head up together with Li gongzi. Master only sees guests for an hour each day, if Miss Bai doesn\u2019t go right now, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll probably have to wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>A Baili gege turning right and another Baili gege turning left, she seriously was shameless. She could only call this in front of people who aren\u2019t aware of the situation. If she really arrived in front of Master, she wouldn\u2019t even be able to say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s like this, I\u2019ll just head up with Li gongzi!\u201d Miss Bai was actually quite willing to do this, without the least hint of ink stains(dallying, more info in CC); she lifted her feet and walked upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go up now ah! Qing Yin, you have to wait until I come down, ok!?\u201d Flinging a coquettish glance at Qing Yin, Tang Doudou was successfully able to see the scene of Qing Yin helplessly turning her face away and refusing to look at her. After this, Tang Doudoulaughed heartily and finally rushed off to catch up with Miss Bai.</p><br/><p>Upstairs in the pavilion building.</p><br/><p>Amidst the gold threaded soft fur, Baili Yu\u2019s long and narrow peach blossom eyes were languidly curved. He had on a crimson colored robe as he reclined in the seat and had his head partially propped up. Three thousand fine black long hair strands fell scattered; it was beautiful to the point that nothing greater could be imagined.</p><br/><p>Soft gentle sounds of guqin lingered as the melody flowed continuously. There was even a clear pure scent of incense, causing the atmosphere to be incomparably relaxing.</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan was standing at the side, looking as if he was almost about to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>What exactly did this Li Xueyi run off to do? They had heard that he was heading over an hour ago, but half an hour had already passed and they still hadn\u2019t seen his figure. Haa, if he takes any longer Master will be closing the doors and declining visitors.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Chuan, has it been an hour yet?\u201d Mildly, the Baili Yu on the couch parted his lips to ask.</p><br/><p>Hearing his voice, Ye Chuan immediately became alert. Glancing at the hourglass placed to the side, he saw that there was only a little less than a half left on top, \u201cReplying Master, there\u2019s still a little less than half an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, seeming to have noticed faint sounds of something outside and he immediately said: \u201cMaster, apart from Li Xueyi, it seems there\u2019s also the footsteps of a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu who was on the couch had already opened his phoenix eyes. He commanded: \u201cLet only Li Xueyi in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a few steps, they had already arrived upstairs.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou walked to the door and was poised to knock when Ye Chuan opened the door from inside and walked out. First, he glanced at Tang Doudou, then he turned to Miss Bai behind her and coldly said: \u201cMiss Bai, stay your steps.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the looks of things, there\u2019s no doubt that it was Baili Yu inside this time.</p><br/><p>Thinking of Baili Yu, thinking of the Alliance Head Command Tablet, then thinking of Bai Feiyun, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t care anymore about whether Miss Bai would be coming or not and just stepped up to ask: \u201cThen can I go in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan nodded.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou laughed \u2018hehe\u2019 and squeezed in through the crack in the door.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she went in, Ye Chuan lifted his hand and closed the door before standing guard in front of the door. It looked very much like he was guarding to prevent Miss Bai from eavesdropping.</p><br/><p>Miss Bai practically ground her silver teeth into powder. The goal was practically in front of her eyes, yet she was blocked from going in at this point. How could she stop herself from being furious?</p><br/><p>Her little mouth pouted as she lightly called: \u201cYe gongzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also looking for Baili gege regarding a matter, can Ye gongzi help me pass this on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan kept his gaze fixed in front, \u201cMaster ordered for Miss Bai to stay her steps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Thank you, Ye gongzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>This Ye Chuan was even harder to deal with than Qing Yin. Looks like she has to think of some other strategies.</p><br/><p>As for Tang Doudou, after she squeezed into the room, she discovered that there was not even a trace of a person. At first, she tiptoed cautiously, but seeing that there was no one around, she relaxed and boldly walked around to look at everything.</p><br/><p>What are they doing? Letting her in, but there\u2019s no one is in here to meet her? It was seriously strange.</p><br/><p>Hey, could it be that Baili Yu, that guy wasn\u2019t here again?</p><br/><p>Plopping down into a sit on a seat to the west and leaning onto the table to the east, she rotated a strand of hair around her finger as she muttered: \u201cBaili foxieT/N ah, Baili foxie ah, where did you run off to ah? You couldn\u2019t be purposefully hiding from me, right\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFox? Is this the pet name Alliance Head Li has for this one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly a languid and magnetic voice sounded out in the room, startling Tang Doudou. She hurriedly retracted her arms and legs and stood up properly. Glancing around, she discovered that there was an additional enchanting red figure in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cBa-baili, Yu!\u201d After stammering for half the day, Tang Doudou was finally able to drag out a smile and waved towards Baili Yu, \u201cGood morning ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood morning? Noon has already passed quite a while ago, did Alliance Head Li just wake up?\u201d Baili Yu played with the ornamental thumb ring that was on his thumb, his eyes focused on Tang Doudou\u2019s uneasy little face. \u201cAlliance Head Li\u2026 is afraid of this one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if!\u201d Tang Doudou puffed up her cheeks. Da fudge, it\u2019s angering this great auntie to death! How come whenever she\u2019s in front of Baili Yu, all her imposing aura fades off like a deflating ball?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it looks quite like that from what I see ah.\u201d Baili Yu chuckled softly, jolting Tang Doudou\u2019s heart into a fluster. With a red garment and peach blossom eyes, and lying down on his side slightly like that, his appearance was even more seductive yao-like than that of seductive yaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat ah, I\u2019m looking for you for a serious business matter.\u201d Opening her eyes wide, Tang Doudou worked hard to free herself from the charm but suffered defeat helplessly again and again. In the end, she simply shifted her eyes away and refused to look at Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Seeing her flustered uneasy expression, the smile on Baili Yu\u2019s face deepened, \u201cAlliance Head Li\u2019s spicy strips were very delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hah? Tang Doudou shifted her gaze back and looked at him with confusion. Why\u2019s he suddenly bringin\u2019 this up? And, how\u2019d he know those were called spicy strips? She had only said this name to Jun Xin before.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you tired standing?\u201d Baili Yu asked another question.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot tired, standing is fine, standing is fine.\u201d Tang Doudou rubbed her chin as she pondered how she should word her request for the Alliance Head Command Tablet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas Alliance Head Li been comfortable while living in this garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEating comfortably?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeeling bored?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>I swear a freak! She didn\u2019t look for Baili Yu just to chatter about daily life, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili gongzi, I wanted to ask, that um. That.. my Alliance Head Command Tablet, can you return it to me now?\u201d Tang Doudou hummed and hawed, breaking off several times but she was finally able to string together the sentence clearly in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Command Tablet? Didn\u2019t this one return it to Alliance Head Li long ago?\u201d Baili Yu spoke with a tone of surprise.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s face turned stiff for a moment, then asked in reply: \u201cDid Baili gongzi remember it wrong? Isn\u2019t the Alliance Head Command Tablet still with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she pointed to a jade tablet hanging off a certain person\u2019s waist. The item was clearly on display there, yet he actually said he already returned it to her. It was seriously embarrassing.E/N</p><br/><p>Those long and narrow eyes lowered and fell onto his own waist. Baili Yu gave another soft chuckle as his slender like jade fingers lightly twirled the jade tablet at his waist, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily nodded. As long as she had that she could go rescue Bai Feiyun as well as get away from this hateful guy for the time being.</p><br/><p>But unexpectedly, Baili Yu actually said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t the Alliance Head Command Tablet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh, that, how could that not be the Alliance Head Command Tablet!\u201d Tang Doudou glared as she strode over with large steps. Bending down as she scratched her head, her glossy water-like eyes looked again at the jade tablet in Baili Yu\u2019s hand. Her little face was filled with puzzlement, \u201cWasn\u2019t the one you gave me last time this one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Baili Yu narrowed his eyes, a trace of dangerous intent flashed through his eyes. But Tang Doudou who was still scrutinizing the shape of the jade tablet didn\u2019t notice at all, the fact that the distance between the two was so little it was a bit frightening.</p><br/><p>He was Li Xueyi, there was no mistake. But why was the feeling he gave off so strange?</p><br/><p>And what was going on between him and Ah Xin?</p><br/><p>After investigating for so many days there was still no information at all. This was the first time something like this happened.</p><br/><p>So should he help him cure the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance or not?</p><br/><p>Baili Yu\u2019s fingers slightly moved to lift the jade tablet a bit. Who would have thought that Tang Doudou was so entranced in staring at it that she directly shifted over, following the jade tablet and almost knocked into Baili Yu\u2019s chin.T/N2</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Baili Yu\u2019s eyes slightly curved but he didn\u2019t move his fingers away again.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not right ah, this was clearly the jade tablet he gave her that day. How did it become a different one? It was too strange. Baili Yu was definitely lying to her because he doesn\u2019t want to give it to her. This fox is too hateful. He clearly knew that she wanted to go rescue someone, yet he was still hiding and tucking it away like this.</p><br/><p>Ah, then, what should she do?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Baili gongzi know the matter of Bai Feiyun being trapped by the Demonic Sect?\u201d Tang Doudou felt like she should still take it slowly step by step. First she should lead the topic into Bai Feiyun\u2019s matter before letting nature take its course and bringing up the matter of the Alliance Head Command Tablet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been spread through the entire Jianghu, to not know would be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pinched her chin as she muttered, \u201cRegarding this matter, what are Baili gongzi\u2019s views?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo particular views. This one is nothing more than a businessman and doesn\u2019t understand the matters of the Jianghu.\u201d Lifting up the tea next to him, he took a shallow sip before continuing, \u201cAlliance Head Li has asked the wrong person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, Young Master Jun has come.\u201d Suddenly, Ye Chuan\u2019s voice came from outside the door.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Baili Yu to speak, Jun Xin\u2019s surprised voice immediately sounded, \u201cBai Lianhua, why are you also here? When did you come? How come you\u2019re not going in? Afraid Baili Yu will chase you out? Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Jun Xin\u2019s familiar voice, Tang Doudou unexpectedly felt relief. Afterwards, she felt like laughing. Bai Lianhua* is Miss Bai\u2019s maiden name? It truly was an exotic enough name\u2026 what were Miss Bai\u2019s parents thinking? But, thinking about it again, people in the past didn\u2019t have this term so what was she blindly thinking so much for!?T/N3</p><br/><p> \u2013 Bai Lian Hua translates to \u2018white lotus flower\u2019. In the past, it was used to point to the beauty of a lotus flower that was unstained by the mud it grew out of and symbolized purity. Nowadays, on the internet it\u2019s often used to mock people and has a similar meaning as the term \u2018green tea bitch\u2019(). It points to someone that looks pure on the surface but is rotten inside. A person that pretends to be pure, noble and virtuous.</p><br/><p>The current business was more important. Tang Doudou raised her head and only now did she discover that their posture was a bit inappropriate.</p><br/><p>A certain person reclined calmly on the soft couch. There was the faint scent of incense in the air. She was stooped at his waist area with her head lowered. Even though she was looking at that jade tablet, if you were looking in from outside the door, this position was very very bad.T/N2\u2014</p><br/><p>As she blanked out for a brief moment, the door had already opened with a bang.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin who was wearing a simple black rogue outfit casually walked in without looking, \u201cBaili Yu, I heard Li Xueyi came to find you\u2026 find you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of the voice had just fallen when the smile on his face froze and an unnatural expression flashed through his eyes. When did this stinkin\u2019 woman get so close with Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>Ye Chuan who had also followed in froze as well. He reacted very quickly and before Bai Lianhua was able to approach, his hand moved behind him and that door abruptly shut.</p><br/><p>With the loud sound of a bang, everyone snapped back to their senses.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou naturally wanted to hurry and get away from Baili Yu, this dangerous guy. But the moment she moved, Baili Yu\u2019s hand shot out unusually fast and pulled her arm down. She cried out in alarm as she felt the sky spin and earth turn. When she returned to her senses, Tang Doudou was stunned to discover that Baili Yu had already drew her into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Xin, are you looking for Xueyi for something?\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

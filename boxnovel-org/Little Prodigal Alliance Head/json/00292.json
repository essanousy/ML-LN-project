Lan Jia keeps a really tight watch on this room. I\u2019ve come here once, but I got discovered. I only managed to get out of it by hiding in the cauldron that mother left in the room below this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was also in that cauldron that I discovered all of Mother\u2019s secrets.\u201d Baili Yiling started searching through the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that secret the fake immortality pill?\u201d Tang Doudou also started carefully searching through the room. If they actually managed to find the antidote to the Hoarfrost Poison, then this trip to Cerulean Mountain would have been worth it. In addition, this was all she could do for Baili Yu as of now.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019ve heard Grandpa Gui mention the immortality pill countless times during my childhood. At first, I had wondered if an immortality pill really existed. If it did exist, didn\u2019t it mean that there were celestials? If I found a celestial, maybe I could beg him to help me save my mother and father\u2026 However, Grandpa Gui said it was impossible for immortals to exist in this world. Celestials were nothing more than something unattainable that humans longed for!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I was young back then, so I thought he was lying to me. I wanted to obtain that immortality pill and find a celestial in order to beg him to fulfill my wish. That\u2019s why, after Grandpa Gui passed away, I started looking into the matter of the immortality pill and started following Lan Jia\u2026 It was only after I entered that large cauldron that I finally understood that Grandpa Gui had been telling the truth. The so-called immortality pill was nothing more than a fantasy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it precisely a fantasy? Tang Doudou inwardly laughed. She felt that Lan Jia probably knew this as well, but it was already too late to turn back. He probably felt guilty as well, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have set up so many memorial tablets here.</p><br/><p>Every time he recalled the past and stood in front of these memorial tablets, what would he think?</p><br/><p>His heart was probably also filled with remorse.</p><br/><p>He was a hateful person, but also pitiful. However, he deserved to die!</p><br/><p>So many innocent lives had been taken away due to his desire for a fantasy. Those poor infants that had been thrown into pools of poison right after they were born were the most pitiful. Right after they came into this world, their own father had\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gave a long sigh. Suddenly, she stepped on something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYiling!\u201d She reached out to feel it. When she found that it seemed like a box, she hastily called Baili Yiling over. \u201cThere\u2019s something here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling hadn\u2019t found anything after searching this entire time and was starting to get angry, so when she heard Tang Doudou say this, she hastily ran over. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, a small flame leaped to life on her finger, causing Tang Doudou a shock. \u201cYiling, you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a little trick. If Sister-in-Law is interested, Yiling will teach you once we get out!\u201d After she said that, she lowered her head to take a closer look at that box.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t very large, but it was very heavy. They had to work together to drag the box out of the dark area to the lit room.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling blew out the flame on her hand, then lightly knocked on the wooden box. Her eyes curved into a smile as she laughed. \u201cHa, Lan Jia is sure self-confident. He didn\u2019t even leave a trap.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou watched curiously, Baili Yiling got an iron wire from somewhere and inserted it into the lock. She lifted the wire lightly and there was the sound of a click as the box opened.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of things contained inside. There were ancient texts, jade bottles, and even a lot of black balls that looked quite heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Baili Yiling flatly as she reached to take one of the ancient texts out.</p><br/><p>However, just when her hand reached the edge of the box, her expression suddenly changed and she quickly withdrew her hand and slammed the box shut.</p><br/><p>It happened so quickly that it took a few moments for Tang Doudou to react. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo close!\u201d Baili Yiling sighed, then glanced at Tang Doudou who looked completely confused. Immediately afterward, she smiled again and said, \u201cSister-in-Law, you really have such good luck! This is precisely what we needed to find!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was that simple to find? Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but feel disbelief. \u201cH-how do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019ll tell you as we walk. I can guarantee that this is what we need! That dumb brother of mine can now be saved!\u201d Baili Yiling\u2019s tone was light, but it just stirred up Tang Doudou\u2019s curiosity even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe antidote to cure the Hoarfrost Poison is in there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, Tang Doudou left the secret room as if she was walking on clouds. Although she was carrying a heavy box, she didn\u2019t feel its weight at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-Law, stop grinning so foolishly, you still need to figure out how to explain our actions to Big Brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling\u2019s words were like a bucket of cold water. Tang Doudou immediately stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Sister-in-Law, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not one of those people that have no sense of comradeship. When the time comes, I\u2019ll definitely face Big Brother\u2019s wrath with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYiling, this isn\u2019t what I\u2019m worried about.\u201d Tang Doudou smiled wryly. Baili Yiling\u2019s line of thought really jumped around a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you worried about? You worry about people other than my older brother? Could it be Mu Ye? My good Sister-in-Law, I can tell that Mu Ye is a pretty good person, but he\u2019s too boring! If you end up together with that sort of person, you\u2019ll probably wither from boredom for the rest of your life. However, my brother\u2019s completely different\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, they truly were siblings. This strong narcissism was so distinctive in their family!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, Mu Ye and I are only good friends and he\u2019s saved my life several times. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Baili Yiling walked up and held Tang Doudou\u2019s arm. \u201cBig Brother dotes on Sister-in-Law so much, he definitely wouldn\u2019t do anything to you, so don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. Hopefully that really was the case.</p><br/><p>The two then jumped through that opening to get back down to the stone room below. When that demonic bug didn\u2019t stir, Tang Doudou took a few steps forward. However, she soon noticed that Baili Yiling hadn\u2019t followed.</p><br/><p>She turned back and saw that Baili Yiling was currently holding several small black balls.</p><br/><p>\u201cYiling, what are those?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! I\u2019m going to make it so Lan Jia will never again be able to recover from this setback!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

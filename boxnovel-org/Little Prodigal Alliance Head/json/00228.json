Why would it be here? It\u2019s seriously too damaging to the scenery!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she walked up and kicked the book of erotic images. From the direction, it seemed like she had been trying to kick it into the water.</p><br/><p>However, she had kicked it with too much force so the book ended up falling apart. The breeze that blew over from the surface of the lake immediately sent those pages flying all over the place. The women blushed from seeing the drawings on the papers and ran away, crying in alarm. Meanwhile, some busybodies reached out and caught the papers to examine them with relish. After a while, they discovered a huge secret.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! There\u2019s actually a mark on this!\u201d Someone shouted in midst of the chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cMark? What mark?\u201d After someone said that, some people that liked to act as gentlemen used the excuse of looking for the mark to catch some pages.</p><br/><p>Cries of surprise immediately started coming from the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere actually is one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat mark? Why didn\u2019t I see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you\u2019re purposefully pretending not to see since you\u2019re looking at an interesting part, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! As if I\u2019m that type of person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere, on the upper right corner. Those two words are so large \u2013 Nangong Yan \u2013 how can you miss them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is Nangong Yan ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd immediately exploded. Tang Doudou winked at Jun Xin who was also looking at a page with interest.</p><br/><p>This development was good enough, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>The evidence had been destroyed and Nangong Yan couldn\u2019t explain herself since she was unconscious. By the time she woke up, public opinion would have already been set.</p><br/><p>It had to be acknowledged that this method Jun Xin had come up with was ruthless and effective. Nangong Yan was going to have to stay in Wind Cloud Island for the rest of her life to hide her face.</p><br/><p>As long as Nangong Yan couldn\u2019t come out, she wouldn\u2019t be a threat. Although Tang Doudou hadn\u2019t been able to take revenge for that stab, she still felt a lot more refreshed.</p><br/><p>When her thoughts arrived here, she started feeling grateful towards Jun Xin again.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, despite the fact that the guy was clearly looking at the paper, after she winked at him, he looked up with a devious smile and gave her a thumbs up as he mouthed something.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be saying: stinkin\u2019 woman, beautiful work!</p><br/><p>Hell, that\u2019s of course! She was the one that had stepped out after all!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou retrieved her gaze and looked at Nangong Yan who was lying on the ground, overlooked. She felt that this woman was quite pitiful. After this incident, it\u2019d probably be hard for her to even get married.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Xin told her earlier that if the things Nangong Yan prepared had been revealed, she would have been the one whose reputation was destroyed.</p><br/><p>It truly seemed that if a woman wasn\u2019t ruthless, she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her position.</p><br/><p>However, was it worth it to do all of this just because of a man?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shook her head and glanced at Yu Fenger who was still stunned before walking to Murong Yu. \u201cMurong gongzi, from the looks of it, we won\u2019t be able to resolve Miss Nangong\u2019s incident today. Why don\u2019t you have someone send her back to her inn first!\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that, she lowered her voice and reminded him, \u201cThe assassins are more important right now. When I was swimming in the lake earlier, I noticed something abnormal beneath the lake. I\u2019m afraid something terrible will happen if we don\u2019t hurry and investigate it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was the one who told her about the abnormality beneath the lake.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, when Murong Yu heard this, he was so stirred up he didn\u2019t even respond to her. After instructing someone to carry Nangong Yan back, he rushed off.</p><br/><p>The spectators saw that the people involved were leaving and started leaving as well, satisfied with the show and still holding onto the erotic pictures with Nangong Yan\u2019s signatures.</p><br/><p>Yu Fenger also came back to his senses. He glanced at Tang Doudou and scratched his head embarrassedly. \u201cI never thought that she was actually this kind of lady. Back then when that woman rushed up, I even spoke up for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aiy, this Big Brother Yu of hers was so naive. The only reason Nangong Yan had caused such a fuss here was because she was planning to drag her down.</p><br/><p>Did Big Brother Yu really think Nangong Yan was trying to get justice?</p><br/><p>It must be known that if Yu Fenger, Nangong Yan, and the others hadn\u2019t talked about this matter, no one would have known.</p><br/><p>In the end, Nangong Yan had been too self-confident and thought she had obtained dirty information on Tang Doudou that she could use. She had only harmed herself in trying to harm another, so she deserved this outcome.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was all thanks to Jun Xin. If it weren\u2019t for him, Nangong Yan probably would have succeeded in her plan.</p><br/><p>And she would have been in Nangong Yan\u2019s place right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought she was actually like this either. I thought she was a very cute little sister.\u201d When Tang Doudou recalled how she had saved Nangong Yan back then only to be stabbed, she could only sigh.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She didn\u2019t know which unfortunate soul had ended up angering this wealthy miss again.</p><br/><p>However, that pitiful soul soon spoke. \u201cMiss, if you don\u2019t drink the medicine, you won\u2019t be able to hold up until Baili gongzi comes back!\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>Karma sure came around full. Nangong Yan had contracted a fatal illness!</p><br/><p>\u201cDog of a slave! You have no right to meddle in this miss\u2019s matters!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan had gotten some guts! He actually dared call Nangong Yan in this way now.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was absorbed in listening and couldn\u2019t help but press herself against the wall to hear better.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned slave! Who lent you the guts for you to dare call this miss by her name! Is Yan er a name that a lowly slave like you has the right to call!!!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan er, calm down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Nangong Yan smashed something again. Her voice was trembling as she screamed, \u201cScram! Go away! The farther the better! I\u2019m disgusted by the sight of you, you lowly thing! Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know about those filthy thoughts of yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they were separated by a wall, Tang Doudou had no way of seeing the look on Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s face, but it was probably not pretty. After all, he was still a man with dignity. How could he take being abused like a dog continuously by the woman he loved?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou shook her head. Although Nangong Yan\u2019s personality was loathsome, Liu Zhiyuan was also the one bringing this upon himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf my love for you is filthy, then what about yours!?\u201d Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s voice was hoarse from repressed anger. Tang Doudou could sense his suppressed resentment even though she couldn\u2019t see his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like Baili Yu and has been infatuated with him for so many years. You often call out his name even in your dreams. You\u2019ve done so many disgusting things because of him! Isn\u2019t your love just as filthy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that just because you were born with a noble status and I was born with a lowly identity, your like is just like while my love is filthy and disgusting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! You\u2019re just a lowly servant! You have no right to talk about love!\u201d Nangong Yan was very stirred up as well.</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan laughed coldly. \u201cIs that so? I\u2019m lowly? Then what about you? How are you not lowly? Back then, you drugged Baili Yu to try and use your body to bind him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, I never did!\u201d When this matter was brought up, Nangong Yan immediately exploded like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. Her sharp voice even attracted the attention of the black-robed men on this side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that\u2026\u201d Before they even got all of their words out, there was the sound of a sword slicing through the air.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was alarmed. Liu Zhiyuan had killed them.</p><br/><p>Following that, she heard the sound of a door being pushed open. Tang Doudou hastily looked around and couldn\u2019t help but curse this house for being so crude. There wasn\u2019t a single place to hide.</p><br/><p>The windows were also tightly locked. After giving a couple trial tugs, she gave up and glanced towards the door again. Outside, Liu Zhiyuan had already taken off the lock and seemed about to come crashing in.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, her eyes lit up and she rushed forward.</p><br/><p>At almost the same time, the door was pushed open and made a bang.</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan walked in with a dark expression and glanced around the room, even checking the roof. He only slowly walked out once he was certain that there was no trace of a person around. The sword in his hand flashed like snow and instantly turned the two corpses outside into unidentifiable pieces.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou leapt down soundlessly from the roof of the door only after she heard the sound of the door closing. She glanced at the two piles of bloody flesh in front of the door with sympathy in her eyes, then approached the wall to keep listening.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that she was unafraid of death, but she wanted to know whether Nangong Yan had succeeded with the drug back then!</p><br/><p>When Liu Zhiyuan returned, Nangong Yan seemed to have calmed down. \u201cYou said that you would help me keep it secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I agreed to help you keep it secret, and I have done it. Haven\u2019t I stayed silent all these years?\u201d Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t as stirred up as before either. \u201cAll these years, I\u2019ve listened carefully and remembered everything you said, but what about you? You\u2019ve forgotten everything you\u2019ve once said!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan roared with a pained tone, then there was the sound of something being pushed down.</p><br/><p>Nangong Yan shouted in alarm, \u201cYou! Liu Zhiyuan, what do you think you\u2019re doing!? Let me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan replied fiercely, \u201cYan er, I shouldn\u2019t have let you go back then. If I had held on, we wouldn\u2019t have fallen to this point.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! What do you mean by this!?\u201d Nangong Yan\u2019s originally panicked voice suddenly became grim as if she could tell Liu Zhiyuan was about to say something shocking.</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan didn\u2019t reply. He seemed to have started violating Nangong Yan as there was the sound of a slap followed by Nangong Yan\u2019s trembling voice. \u201cDamned slave, you actually dared to assault me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tsk tsk tsk. Tang Doudou shook her head. Was there something wrong with Nangong Yan\u2019s brain?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t his actions clear enough? He clearly wanted to do dat ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cAssault?\u201d Liu Zhiyuan seemed to have gotten used to being hit as he didn\u2019t get angry at all and just laughed coldly. \u201cYan er, could it be that you aren\u2019t curious why Baili Yu doesn\u2019t remember that incident?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Nangong Yan\u2019s voice trembled.</p><br/><p>Liu Zhiyuan laughed again. Following that, there was the sound of weeping and moans. Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t some naive little lady and naturally knew what Liu Zhiyuan was doing.</p><br/><p>She rubbed her chin as she considered whether or not to go stop this\u2026</p><br/><p>After all, how could she keep a clear conscience if she allowed a young lady to be defiled right in front of her?</p><br/><p>However, if she tried to be a hero with this little frame of hers, she\u2019d probably be killed with a strike.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is he supposed to remember something he has never done?\u201d Liu Zhiyuan\u2019s words landed on Nangong Yan\u2019s heart like a freezing blade.</p><br/><p>She refuted angrily, \u201cYou\u2019re lying! I remember it clearly! B-back then, back then, it was Big Brother Baili!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then?\u201d Liu Zhiyuan was becoming stirred up as well. \u201cBack then, Baili Yu hadn\u2019t even touched that soup. He has never accepted anything you gave him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Nangong Yan\u2019s voice was filled with horror. \u201cYou\u2019re lying, you\u2019re lying! Don\u2019t think you can trick me, that person was clearly Big Brother Baili!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether or not it was him, don\u2019t you already know?\u201d Liu Zhiyuan laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then, he lifted Tang Doudou in a princess carry and brought her onto the sandy shore.</p><br/><p>The feeling of finally being on solid ground again was indescribably delightful.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Cerulean Mountain?\u201d After she gained a steady footing, she started sizing up this island that was named Cerulean Mountain. \u201cNo matter how I look at it, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a place that the Seven Great Saint Tribes would be staying in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu walked up and tapped her nose. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he started heading into the island.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou once again turned back to look at that sea dragon. For some reason, a strange feeling had floated up when that sea dragon glanced at her. She felt as if she had seen the sea dragon before.</p><br/><p>However, when she glanced back this time, the sea dragon was already gone and the surface of the sea was once again tranquil as if nothing had ever happened.</p><br/><p>Tch. Forget it. If it was gone, then it was gone!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was just about to retrieve her gaze when she saw that there was a little black dot in the distance. It seemed to be a boat.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaili Yu, Baili Yu!\u201d She chased after Baili Yu. \u201cLook over there, isn\u2019t that a boat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu didn\u2019t have to look back to know that she was talking about Nangong Yan\u2019s boat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nangong Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Cloud Island isn\u2019t far from Cerulean Island, but Wind Cloud Island prohibits their disciples from getting within one hundred meters in the range of Cerulean Island.\u201d Baili Yu reached out and pulled Tang Doudou into his arms again. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that her motives in coming here probably aren\u2019t simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t be aiming towards you again, right!?\u201d Tang Doudou had really wanted to say that Nangong Yan was aiming for her, but she already blurt out her first thought before her second could fully form.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu lightly rubbed his chin on her forehead. \u201cWife looks so cute when she\u2019s jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou reached up and softly slapped his face. Then she stepped backward onto a rock and said, \u201cYoung fellow Baili, you\u2019d best behave! Otherwise, this lady will make you regret it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled gently, completely unconcerned about her threat. He reached out and tugged again, then lifted her onto his shoulder and started walking forward with quick steps.</p><br/><p>Not walking saved energy, so Tang Doudou stayed on Baili Yu\u2019s shoulder and enjoyed the break.</p><br/><p>She looked at the surrounding trees that seemed to be tall enough to reach the sky and the bits of moonlight that spilled down. She suddenly realized that Baili Yu seemed very familiar with this place, so she asked, \u201cBig evil spirit, you\u2019ve been here before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve probably already gone to all the places that needed to be visited in the world these past years while investigating Madam Qin and the Hoarfrost Poison,\u201d replied Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>When he brought up the Hoarfrost Poison, Tang Doudou immediately latched onto the topic. \u201cWhat exactly is with the Hoarfrost Poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu froze for a moment before he continued walking. \u201cBack then I was still a child. How could I know what it was?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that I\u2019ve read that medicinal book?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and Tian Weishi were talking about it every day. Even if I didn\u2019t want to eavesdrop, it\u2019d be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou gave a heavy sigh. \u201cBaili Yu, if we don\u2019t find the antidote soon, you\u2019re going to die! What will I do after you die? Could it be that I\u2019ll have to just be a widow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Baili Yu slapped her butt as punishment. \u201cWife should get rid of this thought. How could this husband bear to die before enjoying a lifetime together with Wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch. But even now there\u2019s still no way to cure this Hoarfrost Poison\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou propped up her head to look towards the distance. \u201cBaili Yu, I\u2019ll warn you now that if you die, I\u2019m going to remarry right away. I\u2019m going to marry several dozen men so that even when you\u2019re down at the Yellow Springs, there\u2019d be a mass of green as large as the prairie of Hulunbuir above your head!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu \u201cWhat is the prairie of Hulunbuir?\u201d (Hulunbuir is a prefecture-level city in Inner Mongolia)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of getting a green hat, right?\u201d Tang Doudou giggled. \u201cOnce you die, I\u2019ll make you wear lots and lots of green hats until you\u2019re so pissed you\u2019ll crawl out from your grave! Aiy, just the thought of that scene is hilarious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife has such a good heart!\u201d Baili Yu gritted his teeth. From the looks of it, he really couldn\u2019t die! Otherwise, if he really ended up getting some prairie of Hulunbuir due to this dumb woman, wouldn\u2019t his illustrious reputation be completely ruined?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s why ah, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu replied, \u201cThis husband will carefully obey Wife\u2019s command and definitely will not die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hugged his shoulder and chomped on him. \u201cI\u2019m being serious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying either.\u201d Baili Yu shifted the person biting his shoulders to lean her against his chest. \u201cDoudou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou now felt like crying.</p><br/><p>She just hoped that they would be able to find a way to cure the Hoarfrost Poison on this island. Otherwise, Baili Yu would definitely die!</p><br/><p>The events hadn\u2019t even advanced, but she already had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu comforted his rather emotional little wife, then carried her and continued walking into the forest.</p><br/><p>Beneath the rays of the moon, a black-clothed man\u2019s figure flashed behind the two, and then he landed on the top of a distant tree.</p><br/><p>He coldly watched the two gradually walk into the distance. Suddenly, he tugged off the black cloth around his face to reveal cold facial features. His black eyes had already become the blue of ice.</p><br/><p>This person was precisely the person that had followed them the entire way, the person that not even Baili Yu had been able to shake off \u2013 Mu Ye.</p><br/><p>After tugging off the cloth, he whistled towards the forest. It was a signal with three long tunes and two short ones.</p><br/><p>A few moments later, an energetic gray monkey bounced out. When it saw Mu Ye, it cried out happily as it ran over.</p><br/><p>It climbed up onto Mu Ye\u2019s shoulder and rubbed against his face affectionately.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye took out a bag of melon seeds and said expressionlessly, \u201cKeep careful watch on the people that just passed by.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gray monkey took the seeds and bowed as it nodded. Then it jumped off his shoulders and started chasing after Tang Doudou and Baili Yu while looking back every few steps.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye then took out several similar-looking antique lamps from the cloth bundle on his back. He picked one up and looked at it in the moonlight, but still couldn\u2019t see any signs of what he was looking for. He placed the lamps back, then disappeared into the forest like an owl.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He just stood there and stared at Tang Doudou. After a while, he took the initiative to speak. \u201cIn the past, I wanted your life, but I don\u2019t want it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>The change in development occurred too quickly, for a few moments Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t quite follow. Without thinking, she asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want it anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>After she spoke, she returned to her senses and itched to just bite her own tongue off. Damned retard. Did you get too used to people wanting your life so now you can\u2019t adjust?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, why do you suddenly not want my life anymore? Could it be that your conscience discovered that a good person like me shouldn\u2019t die?\u201d Tang Doudou hastily explained in order to prevent Mu Ye from misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye looked at her disdainfully as if she was an idiot and said coldly, \u201cHow could you possibly count as a good person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026she should just keep quiet after all.</p><br/><p>However, curiosity kept scratching at her heart like a cat\u2019s claw, making her unbearably uncomfortable. When she saw that Mu Ye didn\u2019t plan to take her life, she became much braver and asked, \u201cFor a while, you said you wanted my life, yet a while later you didn\u2019t want it anymore. No matter what there should be a reason, shouldn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I wanted, I wanted, when I didn\u2019t want it anymore, I didn\u2019t. There\u2019s no reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother ah, can\u2019t we be a bit more forthcoming with our words? How are we supposed to continue with you like this?\u201d Tang Doudou felt completely helpless in face of this da ye. Could he stop being so obstinate?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your big brother,\u201d replied Mu Ye coldly.</p><br/><p>His conduct was pretty much provoking Tang Doudou to explode. She itched to just beat him up. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s stop wasting time and get to the main topic. You probably know why I came to look for you. As long as you don\u2019t want my life, anything else is fine. How\u2019s that? Has this Alliance Head been frank enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was completely like a little hooligan, where was there any trace of an Alliance Head\u2019s dignity? However, getting straight to the point was also a pretty good choice. Wasting words wasn\u2019t his style after all.</p><br/><p>He thought for a little bit and the coldness in his eyes melt slightly. When he spoke, his tone was stiff and seemed a bit embarrassed. \u201cI want to marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJesus ah!\u201d Tang Doudou staggered and ran into the tree trunk. \u201cD-did I just have a hallucination?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s expression darkened and his eyes chilled again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear wrong. As long as you marry me, I\u2019ll withdraw the Demonic Sect forces and will even help you get rid of Elder Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe key point is, why ah!?\u201d Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t make sense of the situation at all, but she wasn\u2019t narcissistic to the point of thinking that it was because Mu Ye liked her. There was definitely a different reason for why he was doing this. This pertained to the safety of the martial arts circles, and also to her life\u2019s big event, she, of course, had to ask clearly!</p><br/><p>After she asked \u2018why\u2019 Mu Ye sunk into silence. After a while, he finally forced out a sentence that almost made Tang Doudou voluntarily ram her head into the tree. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou instantly flared up. She didn\u2019t need to know about the rest but she couldn\u2019t even know about this?</p><br/><p>Perhaps seeing that she was about to explode and because Mu Ye felt that it was unfair to make a person get married when they weren\u2019t sure what was going on, he said, \u201cI read an ancient text that said the only way to cure the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance was to get married with someone who had been poisoned by the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance before\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said \u2018get married,\u2019 a trace of unnaturalness flashed across his face. It was clear that there was another meaning.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou took a moment to think about it and immediately broke out in cold sweat.</p><br/><p>No wonder Bai Feiyun said that the only one who would be able to cure her poison was Baili Yu. In addition, though Baili Yu brought up the matter of curing the poison from the first day they met, he never made any indications of doing it. So it turned out that this was the catch!</p><br/><p>They actually had to get married\u2026 Of course, it wasn\u2019t just getting married, but entering the bridal room ah! (Consummation if it wasn\u2019t clear enough)</p><br/><p>As Tang Doudou thought about this, her expression also became unnatural. What Mu Ye meant was, was\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait. Tang Doudou suddenly looked up, her tone shocked. \u201cY-you also got poisoned by Disseminating Tassel Fragrance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally Tang Doudou thought he would say that she didn\u2019t need to know. Unexpectedly he admitted it so straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it was just a normal poison. I only found out that it was the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance after going to Azure Water Valley last time. I\u2019ve been looking for you ever since I found out that you and Baili Yu have both been poisoned with it before.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing these puzzling words, in a brain-dead moment, Tang Doudou asked Mu Ye, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you go look for Baili Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s face instantly turned black.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily changed her words. \u201cAhem, I was just joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that, she looked towards Mu Ye again, puzzled. \u201cDidn\u2019t you go to Azure Water Valley last time to kill someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCang Baicao found out about the fact I was poisoned, so he must be killed.\u201d The things that came out of Mu Ye\u2019s mouth were too inhumane, but it did fit with his cold temperament.</p><br/><p>Although what he said made a lot of sense, Tang Doudou still felt that it probably wasn\u2019t as simple as he was presenting it to be.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t marry you! Although you only want to marry me for the sake of curing the poison and nothing else, I\u2019ve already agreed to marry Baili Yu. Moreover, I haven\u2019t been cured of the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance either, so I probably can\u2019t help you.\u201d She wasn\u2019t an extremely traditionalist person. It wasn\u2019t impossible for her to make a bit of a sacrifice for the sake of saving someone, but she hadn\u2019t even cured her own poison yet, so how could she help Mu Ye?</p><br/><p>In addition, if she really agreed to help Mu Ye, she\u2019d probably lose Baili Yu. That was the most important thing.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy for her to finally find someone she liked, she didn\u2019t want to lose him.</p><br/><p>The person who was poisoning people with Disseminating Tassel Fragrance was really strange as well. Why was he only targeting men?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

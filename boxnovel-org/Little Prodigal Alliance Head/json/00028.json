Seeing that Qing Yin was still dazing out, Tang Doudou went over and patted her shoulder.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you dazing out for ah! Let\u2019s go, tell me where you guys\u2019 kitchen is? This Mi\u2026\u2026 Mister will make something tasty for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cKitchen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! You better not say that in this huge garden of yours you don\u2019t even have a kitchen!\u201d Tang Doudou pulled the outer robe from the tree and put it on in a leisurely and easy-going manner. Taking advantage of the opportunity, she pulled Qing Yin\u2019s little hand and headed towards the outer courtyard.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin was already a little displeased with him, yet she couldn\u2019t ward off his cordialness. Thinking again, the person was a guest. Satisfying the guests\u2019 requests was her duty from the start. Right now, Tang Doudou wanted the kitchen, so she could only lead her there.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Actually, Qing Yin was also curious as to what kind of tasty things she would be able to make.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a kitchen, but it hasn\u2019t been used in a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was surprised: \u201cYour Master doesn\u2019t eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin replied: \u201cEverything Master eats are prepared by Meng Yu jiejie* in the small kitchen.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2013 \u201cjiejie\u201d Older sister, can be used to address people not blood related</p><br/><p>\u201cSmall kitchen? This Baili Yu sure is something! To actually use special treatment! Then don\u2019t you guys eat?\u201d She remembered that in the past apparently masters and servants could not eat together!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin smiled: \u201cWe as servants naturally eat Master\u2019s leftovers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! Baili Yu has that much money yet he\u2019s still this miserly! Such exploitism!\u201d Tang Doudou angrily said. From the corners of her eyes she saw Qing Yin\u2019s small pointed chin underneath her veil and couldn\u2019t help but feel heartache: \u201cLook at your pitiful little face, your chin is already starved to the shape of a cone. Looking at this makes my heart ache.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She reached out and was just about to stroke Qing Yin\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing this scene in front of her eyes, Qing Yin recalled the event in which Tang Doudou wanted to sleep together with her and Qing Yin\u2019s face immediately paled. An audacious thought appeared in her head, this Li Xueyi couldn\u2019t have taken a fancy to her, right?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She immediately flung away Tang Doudou\u2019s hand and said, helplessly panicking: \u201cI\u2019ll bring gongzi to the kitchen area first! If it truly cannot be used then this servant will try to think of some other idea!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After she finished saying so, she ran as if escaping. In a blink her figure was gone.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou bit her tongue. Didn\u2019t she agree to bring her to the kitchen? Running that fast, how is she supposed to follow?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Forget it, do it yourself and you\u2019ll have ample food and clothing!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s search!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Not to mention, Qing Yin in her panic ran very far and only recalled now that she had even forgotten Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>When she turned back to look, the original place was absolutely empty and she didn\u2019t know where the person ran off to.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Forget it, just let him explore for a while. The garden is so big after all, once he\u2019s tired he\u2019ll come back.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Just as she was going to walk forward, Qing Yin suddenly stomped her feet. Oh no!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Master said he would be coming over today. If Li Xueyi charged to where Master was, wouldn\u2019t that be bad?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, her little face paled again and she hurriedly rushed off to find Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>On another note, Tang Doudou currently felt like her head was about to explode. For this ancient courtyard to be built so large was already enough, yet the scenery was all nearly the same. Just walking around a few times was enough to make a person dizzy.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seriously this Baili Yu! If the garden is going to be so big find more servants ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After walking half the day she still couldn\u2019t even see a ghost of a figure.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 Someone hurry up and show up. Beanbeans is about to starve to death!\u201d Tang Doudou was hungry to the point stars were swirling in front of her eyes and her legs were going soft.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Sprawled out on her back, she collapsed on the large road. Tang Doudou shouted out two times, then she didn\u2019t even have the energy to groan.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>That damned Baili Yu. Bring her here was probably just for the sake of starving her to death.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jesus!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>As a foodie, to be starved to death is seriously too cruel!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Just as she was mourning for her stomach, she suddenly heard the sound of guqin coming from far away. Tang Doudou froze for a moment, then hurriedly got up from the ground and started walking in the direction of the sound.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After walking for a short while, she saw a courtyard appear in front of her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Eh, she\u2019s finally walked to a different-looking courtyard. Tang Doudou raised her eyes and looked at the courtyard signboard. Inscribed on it were three words.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It was helpless. She couldn\u2019t even recognize a single one and could only faintly make out that the one in the middle was a \u2018snow\u2019 character.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>That guqin sound was coming precisely from this courtyard.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s the sound of a guqin, then there definitely is a person. There\u2019s no way a ghost would be playing guqin in broad daylight, right?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Thinking to the point that there\u2019s someone here, Tang Doudou was unable to hold on and energetically ran inside. In the end, she still didn\u2019t see even half a person.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Under the scorching sun, there was suddenly a burst of chill. It couldn\u2019t be, that it\u2019s really a ghost?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Eeek, scary!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Turning back, just as she was about to run back out, the savory scent of meat suddenly drifted through the air\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Her nose twitched. Quite certain that this was the scent of meat, Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes immediately emitted light, wah! It\u2019s really the smell of meat! Pure and unadulterated deer meat\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s the savory fragrance only described in the legends, so touched\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou swallowed her saliva. Damn, she can\u2019t go on, she must go eat the meat!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Anyone here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s no one can I\u2019m going in~\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Sneakily searching by following the scent of that meat, her voice was quiet to the point that only she herself could hear it.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this courtyard was much smaller than the large garden outside. Very soon, she found the house that was emitting that savory deer meat fragrance. This building looks like a kitchen ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Could this be the kitchen Qing Yin talked about? Didn\u2019t she say that no one uses it?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou pushed the door open a crack and peeked in with suspicion. Her face lit up with delight, as expected it was a kitchen!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looking again, no one\u2019s here!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then what are you still waiting for! Tang Doudou smoothly slipped into the kitchen and closed the door.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Wah! Wah! Wah\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It\u2019s excellent! It\u2019s neat and tidy, everything that should be here is here. A little pot of deer meat was set on top of a high quality charcoal fire and carefully simmering. Lifting the lid, a \u2018gulugulu\u2019 still bubbling rich fragrance wafted upT/C. Tang Doudou took a deep inhale. This is the taste! Refreshing!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Even though the heat control was still not quite there and it would be even more fragrant after a while longer, Tang Doudou was already uncontrollable hungry, so where would she have the mind to care about that much? Let\u2019s eat first and think again later!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Haahoohaahoo*, the fresh and tender deer meat slipped into Tang Doudou\u2019s stomach one by one. One bowl after another, she drank down the thick soup. Not long after, the meat in the pot was gone and the pot bottom could be seen, yet Tang Doudou still desired to continue.</p><br/><p>Sound of inhaling and blowing out with your nose and your mouth.</p><br/><p>After eating, her brain also started working better. She held her chopsticks between her teeth and they lifted and lifted as she thought. She ate all of the meat\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But what\u2019s she gonna do \u2018bout this pot?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She was unbelievably distressed, but there was another person in this kitchen that was even more distressed.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It was rare for him to be able to eat something on the sly, yet he accidently ran into someone. What was even worse was, the person even ate all of his favorite deer meat!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Krrr-rack! With a single bite he snapped the chopsticks in his hand! If it weren\u2019t for the fact he was scared of getting caught by Meng Ru, there was no way he would have jumped to hide on the beams of the room the moment he heard footsteps.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In the spacious kitchen, this sound was particularly conspicuous. </p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou froze. Pulling out her chopsticks, she looked at it. She didn\u2019t bite the chopsticks ah? Then that noise earlier?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Suddenly lifting her head, the two both froze.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then simultaneously gave blood-curdling, pig-being-slaughtered type screeches.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The first to recover was the person on the roofbeam. He moved quickly and dropped down. With one hand he covered Tang Doudou\u2019s mouth while a shining dagger appeared in his other hand. He fiercely warned: \u201cShut up. If you keep screaming and cause Meng Ru to come over, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou slapped away his hand and slightly narrowed her eyes: \u201cYou\u2019re freaking here to steal food too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>At first she was startled too, thinking she was about to be caught. But hearing the two words \u2018Meng Ru\u2019, she instantly understood what was happening.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Immediately, she also felt dismay. Never expected that coming here to steal a snack, she\u2019d actually end up meeting someone of the same (cultivation) path!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHell no, you\u2019re the one stealing food!\u201d Who knew that the moment the other party heard that, he immediately glared at her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cPei, if you\u2019re not here to steal food, what are you hiding on the roof for?\u201d Tang Doudou rolled her eyes* at him, still reflecting on the savory taste of the deer meat. Ancient era is great ah. No matter what it was, it\u2019s all natural; it\u2019s tasty and nutritious.</p><br/><p>Chinese eyeroll is just rolling your eyes back and showing them the whites of your eyes. Like holding up a middle finger, but not that offensive. It literally translates to \u201cwhite eye\u201d and is usually used to express disgust.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pleasantly cool up there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d </p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cUp to you whether you believe or not!\u201d Tsunderely tilting his neck, he saw the absolutely empty pot and his large almond eyes showed devastating disappointment: \u201cJust now wasn\u2019t there still some pieces, why are they gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Turning his gaze, he saw Tang Doudou smacking her lips: \u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sss, already ate, ate it all\u2026\u2026\u201d So so tasty, so so refreshing!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too much! Not even leaving behind one piece, are you still human!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looking at the cute, dazed tsundere young man exposing an expression of inconsolable grief and indignation, Tang Doudou swallowed down the meat still in her mouth and licked her lips as she said: \u201cStop that your-kid-died look. Isn\u2019t it just a pot of deer meat? Jie(Big Sis) will make you something even tastier!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cJie(Big Sis)?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHic, you misheard! What jie no jie, I was just burping. That\u2019s right, what\u2019s your name. I didn\u2019t know that within Baili Yu\u2019s servant girls there\u2019s even a guy?\u201d Crap, she better get used to this identity change fast! Luckily she was able to quickly divert the topic, Tang Doudou sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cI also haven\u2019t seen you before. Where did you crawl out from?\u201d The beautiful young man moved the dagger away: \u201cYou say there\u2019s something even tastier than deer meat, is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>So it turns out he\u2019s also a foodie ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smiled with her eyes squinted: \u201cIsn\u2019t your knowledge and experience too short? There\u2019s plenty of things tastier than deer meat. Go help me watch the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch the door for what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course so I can make something tasty for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Xin*!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun(monarch/gentleman) Xin(heart)</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares what heart you have, hurry up and go watch the door!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin curiously asked: \u201cYou\u2019re going to make it yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, then you want to make it?\u201d Tang Doudou rolled her eyes at Jun Xin then pulled him up and started pushing him outside.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin hurriedly turned around and tugged at her: \u201cHey, I can\u2019t stay outside, I\u2019ll be discovered. It\u2019s best if I just stay inside the building! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll immediately know if there\u2019s even the slightest movement outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou suspiciously peered at him: \u201cYou\u2019re that amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWasting words!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin impatiently urged: \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna make it then hurry up. If it\u2019s not tasty then I will get angry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Butt-aged little brat!</p><br/><p>\u201dButt-aged\u201d refers to when children still goes around naked, aka with butts exposed</p><br/><p>Preparing the kitchen. She ate and drank her fill, so it\u2019s about time to do some proper business.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep watch properly!\u201d After exhorting Jun Xin once, Tang Doudou took off her outer robe and immediately got busy.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Originally, he was worried she was just joking, but unexpectedly, upon seeing her swift movements, Jun Xin couldn\u2019t help but start to look forward to it. What will she make that\u2019s even tastier than deer meat?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In any case, he feels like deer meat is the tastiest thing in the world.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou first thoroughly searched through the kitchen to find everything she needed. After setting everything up, only then did she realize she was still missing quite a few seasonings.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looks like, whether it was the snack in Rutaceae Pavilion or the breakfast Qing Yin brought her, it\u2019s not without reason that they tasted that horrible.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Fortunately, for what she\u2019s making today, missing those seasonings was not that significant.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The important thing is this plaything!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Picking up that small jar, Tang Doudou took a deep inhale. It was still the familiar recipe, still the familiar taste.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>One word, refreshing!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin squatted down behind the door.

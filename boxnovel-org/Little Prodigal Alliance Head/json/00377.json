There\u2019s no rush, we\u2019ll wait for you to get ready so we can head over together.\u201d Bai Luoqing got up with a smile. Someone handed her a very beautiful fan made from purple feathers and she lifted it above her head to block the sun as she looked at Tang Doudou with an expression that seemed to say \u2018don\u2019t try any tricks.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou silently remarked that this woman was seriously scary, but on the surface, she replied with a straightforward smile, \u201cEn, then I\u2019ll have to trouble everyone to wait for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she turned and knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>Once she walked in, she was about to close the door when she noticed Bai Feiyun out of the corner of her eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something to say to you.\u201d His low voice was barely audible. Tang Doudou looked towards Bai Feiyun in confusion and saw that he had already walked past her into the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren hadn\u2019t heard about Bai Feiyun\u2019s change and greeted him cordially when he entered. \u201cBai gongzi, long time no see! You haven\u2019t visited the valley recently, we thought that you wouldn\u2019t be coming anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Bai gongzi, what have you been busy with lately? In the past, no matter how busy you were, you would still come visit once a month. Now that you don\u2019t come at all, it feels strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was surprised. Bai Feiyun actually used to visit Azure Water Valley that frequently?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun replied mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s been rather busy lately so I haven\u2019t had a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiy. Say, why did so many things suddenly happen on the Jianghu in just two years?\u201d Xiao Ren sighed and looked towards Bai Feiyun with pity.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi expressed his agreement. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have so many mundane matters to deal with, based on your natural talent, had you focused on studying medicine, you\u2019d definitely be able to surpass Valley Master really soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMedicinal expertise doesn\u2019t always require studying to improve.\u201d Bai Feiyun\u2019s tone was still very indifferent. He glanced towards the inner courtyard. \u201cI\u2019m going to the library to look for something, so I\u2019ll have to trouble you two to keep an eye on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore Valley Master left, he said that from now on, Bai gongzi is welcomed to use the library as you please. If you want to take something, feel free to! We don\u2019t have to keep an eye on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao left the valley as well?</p><br/><p>No wonder she hadn\u2019t seen him for such a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Cang isn\u2019t in the valley?\u201d asked Bai Feiyun in faint surprise.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi nodded. \u201cHe left several days ago. He seemed to have expected you to come, because he told us this right before he left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t continue asking questions and headed straight to the library.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou had also visited that library several times when she first got here. All that was in there were medicinal books. She couldn\u2019t understand it, so she didn\u2019t go in there anymore.</p><br/><p>Once Bai Feiyun\u2019s figure disappeared at a corner, Tang Doudou called down Jun Xin who was still crouched on the roof. \u201cHow long are you going to stay up there? Are you waiting for candy to fall from the sky?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin stretched laxily, then got up and jumped down gracefully. \u201cI thought you forgot about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou made to rap his head, but before her hand landed, her wrist was caught and pulled. She lost her balance and fell into Jun Xin\u2019s arms.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

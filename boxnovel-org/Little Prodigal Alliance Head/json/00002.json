Faking a lecherous expression, she said, \u201cThe feel\u2019s not bad, how old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s entire body turned soft at Tang Doudou\u2019s touch and she softly moaned, \u201cReplying gongzi, this servant has just passed her sixteenth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sixteen? Auntie, from your looks, you had to be at least thirty-six already! Tang Doudou silently exclaimed in her heart. However, she still kept a vulgar smile on her face and said, \u201cOh, still quite inexperienced, huh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s bashful look caused even Tang Doudou\u2019s heart to throb.</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi, the spring nights are bitterly short*, why don\u2019t you let this servant hurry and help you undress so that we can head to bed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cthe spring nights are bitterly short\u201d is a saying that refers to the fact that in one\u2019s life, the happiest/pleasurable moments are never long enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sisters are all impatient from waiting ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that she had finally reacted to their advances, all the women in the room approached and encircled her. All of them had alluring, \u2018the-gentleman-may-do-whatever-he-pleases\u2019 manners. Tang Doudou feared that if she had been a man, she would\u2019ve already pounced on them with her eyes shining.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the old heavens gave her a female body, not to mention she didn\u2019t know how many cameras were installed in this room. No way did she want to do any on-the-spot live broadcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sisters, look at how many of you there are. I\u2019m afraid that no matter how awesome I may be, I still wouldn\u2019t be able to satisfy you guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed as she continued acting. From the overall situation, she knew that the role she was given was that of a playboy, so naturally she couldn\u2019t act very honorably.</p><br/><p>But unexpectedly, the moment she said that those women all started laughing.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou also laughed, staying in the character of an old pervert.</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi, how could you be so unduly humble? Look at gongzi, your formidable and majestic body. Even if ten more sisters came, presumably\u2026 presumably it would still be nothing difficult\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pffff!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou spurted out a mouthful of old blood a distance away. The hell you mean by formidable and majestic, having ten more? The hell, you think I\u2019m a studhorse?!</p><br/><p>This script was way too crazy!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou forced a laugh and waved her hand, \u201cThis gongzi is tired today. I don\u2019t want to move, let\u2019s play something fresh. This big uncle will bestow a large reward on whoever does the best\u201d</p><br/><p>Calling yourself big sister, uncle, grandfather in Chinese conversation is often used to show arrogance or an informal joking manner. Also, the word for uncle is also used to refer to the masters of a house so it\u2019s used a lot to act arrogant.</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she vigorously patted her chest a few times, acting like a cocky and wealthy big master.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, after a few couple pats, her smile froze on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Where\u2019s her chest!</p><br/><p>She lowered her head to look. \u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Goddammit, where did her meat buns go!? As Tang Doudou went through and felt her entire body from head to toe, she soon discovered another, even more shocking matter.</p><br/><p>She had actually turned into a man!</p><br/><p>A broad palm with prominent joints, with just one look you could tell that it was a man\u2019s hand. On her body was a moon-white ancient-styled chang pao and a folded paper fan was even tucked at her waist.</p><br/><p>What kind of situation was this!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was thoroughly confused.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell her that while she was sleeping, the staff of this program even changed her clothes and styled her?</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi, gongzi\u2026\u201d While Tang Doudou was lost in thought, those women approached again. \u201cGongzi, why did you end up in a daze again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait, ahem! Do you guys have a mirror here?\u201d Tang Doudou currently didn\u2019t have the mind to tangle with these women again. She could still understand if her meat buns were gone, but this palm of hers was clearly a man\u2019s! Modern technology had no way of transforming her this way in such a short time!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a flash of lightning streaked through her mind and with a rumble thundered Tang Doudou until she was scorched on the outside and tender within.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell her she transmigrated? And even transmigrated into a man\u2019s body! Heavens, how could this be!?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s expression was complete chaos. Meanwhile, those women had already found an antique copper mirror from somewhere and brought it here.</p><br/><p>\u201cGongzi, what do you need a mirror for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou took the mirror without replying, because how could she have the mind to care about that woman\u2019s question right now? Her little heart thudded \u2018thump thump thump\u2019. If she really transmigrated into a man\u2019s body, this was all f-ing seriously too shocking, wasn\u2019t it!</p><br/><p>She lifted the mirror with trembling hands. The muddy yellow surface of the copper mirror was smooth and shiny, and on its surface, the image of a face was reflected clearly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

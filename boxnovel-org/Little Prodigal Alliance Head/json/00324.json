It\u2019s probably hard for you to accept it all at once.\u201d Gu Xun watched her brows furrow for a while, then shifted away from this topic with a laugh. \u201cIn any case, I hope Alliance Head Li will keep these matters secret for me, especially from my brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Xun\u2019s qualms were not unfounded. She had personally seen Bai Feiyun visit Bai Luoqing before she left Huai City. In addition, Bai Feiyun\u2019s behavior truly has been strange lately. He had actually put poison on Jun Xin\u2019s injury. That was something she couldn\u2019t tolerate!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve told you everything, Alliance Head Li, shouldn\u2019t you also show me your bottom line?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, I won\u2019t say whether I agree to this yet. I\u2019d like to first ask, Boss Gu, how are you so sure I can help you? You should be able to see that I can barely protect myself right now. After my identity has been revealed, I don\u2019t even know how to get back to Huai City, so how am I supposed to help you?\u201d asked Tang Doudou with a wry smile.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun seemed to have expected this as he replied with a laugh, \u201cAlliance Head Li, I naturally plan to guarantee your safety after getting you into this situation. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you get back to Huai City safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Tang Doudou glanced at him skeptically. \u201cBoss Gu, there\u2019s one more thing that I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Xun poured himself another cup. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m helping you so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! I already owe you a lot for saving Baili Yu, so there\u2019s really no need for you to go through so much extra lengths. However, you were waiting for me to come, weren\u2019t you? You hid Baili Yu on purpose, not due to circumstances like you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li is truly intelligent. That\u2019s right, I do have something I need your help with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t try to guess anymore, please just state it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head, I want the position of alliance head.\u201d Gu Xun had a very bright smile on his face. \u201cAlliance Head Li, are you willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t know how to express her current feelings. She was shocked, surprised, and confused. Why would Gu Xun, a businessman, want to become the martial arts alliance head?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head Li must be curious why a businessman like me chose to ask for your alliance head position instead of the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was correct. As of now, both Baili Yu and she was in his hands, so it\u2019d be quite easy for him to force them to give him the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce. However, it would be much harder to get the alliance head position since Cloud City also had a say in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I can\u2019t tell you the details.\u201d Gu Xun stood up, then glanced out the window. \u201cIt\u2019s already quite late, so I won\u2019t impose upon you two further. Alliance Head Li, please consider what I said before. I hope to receive a favorable reply tomorrow. That would be good for both of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, he turned and left the room.</p><br/><p>Then a courtesan came in to clean up the table.</p><br/><p>This courtesan was familiar. It was Jin Yi, who had served her last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Sir Tang has any needs, just call. Jin Yi will be guarding the door outside.\u201d After Jin Yi finished clearing the table, he lowered his eyes and spoke demerely to Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at him, then suddenly rushed towards him with a dagger in hand.</p><br/><p>Jin Yi hadn\u2019t expected her to attack so suddenly without a word. When he saw that her dagger was heading towards his neck, he instantly dodged to the side.</p><br/><p>By the time he recovered his calm, Tang Doudou was no longer attacking. He realized that he had revealed himself.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t ask any questions and just blew the dust off her dagger before saying, \u201cI got it. You can withdraw.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Sir Tang.\u201d Jin Yi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. He had no choice but to tell his master that Tang Doudou already found out that he knew martial arts.</p><br/><p>Once he left, Tang Doudou finally turned around. Baili Yu with gazing at her with confusion in his eyes, so she reached out and wrapped her arms around him. \u201cAh, I feel like I\u2019m about to die. I need big evil spirit\u2019s hugs and kisses to revive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu indulgently pulled her into his arms and softly pecked her lips. Frustration appeared in his eyes as he said, \u201cI really want to help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, but I can\u2019t have you helping me all the time. It\u2019s about time for me to help you out instead.\u201d Tang Doudou greedily inhaled Baili Yu\u2019s comforting scent. \u201cSince I know the true identity of the owner now, I\u2019ll agree to his request tomorrow. Afterwards, he\u2019ll definitely help get us back to Huai City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you still worried about?\u201d asked Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou sighed. \u201cI\u2019m worried that he\u2019s oversimplifying things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he seems to be pretty confident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t know about our enemies. If he had enough power to stand against our enemies, he wouldn\u2019t need our help to defeat the Bai family.\u201d Tang Doudou furrowed her brows worriedly. This matter was getting more and more complicated. The thing that confused her the most was who exactly was pulling the strings behind the curtain. What was that person\u2019s motive?</p><br/><p>Everything seemed coincidental, but it was all intricately linked. It wasn\u2019t something that she could figure out with her tiny brain.</p><br/><p>So right now, she could only go with her usual style and move through things step by step.</p><br/><p>No matter what, she wasn\u2019t going to get separated from Baili Yu again. She glanced towards the bed, then laughed mischievously. \u201cThis day has been exhausting, let\u2019s go to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it had been the past Baili Yu, he definitely would\u2019ve picked her up happily and headed towards the bed.</p><br/><p>However, presently, Baili Yu nodded seriously in agreement. \u201cIt is about time to rest. I\u2019ll help you prepare the bed. You can sleep on the bed today, I\u2019ll sleep on the floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s jaw dropped to the ground. Baili Yu was being so decent! Was this still her big evil spirit?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d When Baili Yu saw that she seemed astonished, confusion flashed through his eyes. Did he say something wrong?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou used her hands to close her mouth, then asked, \u201cAre you really going to sleep on the ground?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu furrowed his brows. \u201cEn, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou fidgeted with the hem of her garment and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cold today, and you no longer have martial arts. Won\u2019t you catch a cold sleeping on the ground?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t consider this.\u201d Baili Yu stared at the little woman in front of him that was affecting shyness. He seemed to understand her meaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why, why don\u2019t we\u2026 sleep together\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She just watched blankly as Jun Xin\u2019s jaw kept munching and chomping. Soon, the ground was filled with fruit seeds. After a long while, he was finally full and he stretched while belching. His pallor had improved by quite a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you just standing there? Let\u2019s go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling\u2019s lips twitched and she glanced towards Jun Xin\u2019s stomach. He must\u2019ve eaten near a hundred of those fruits just now. Although these fruits weren\u2019t big, they weren\u2019t small either\u2026 She was sincerely worried that he would die from his stomach bursting.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin sensed her gaze and smiled in disdain. \u201cStop being so surprised at everything. If you\u2019re not going, I\u2019m going!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Baili Yiling truly had to admit her respect for Jun Xin, and also for herself. What exactly was she thinking? She could\u2019ve fallen in love with anyone, but she actually ended up falling for Jun Xin?</p><br/><p>The two walked in the forest for quite a long time but their surroundings didn\u2019t change. It was just an unending stretch of forest.</p><br/><p>They soon discovered what was off about the forest. An undisturbed jungle like this should have a lot of animals, but on the way here, not only were there no animals, there weren\u2019t even bugs. The only sound aside from the sounds they made was the rustling sound of the leaves made by the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go over and take a look.\u201d It\u2019d only waste strength to continue walking like this. Jun Xin pointed to the dense forestry above them as he said this to Baili Yiling.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling glanced up. \u201cJun Xin, actually, there\u2019s something I forgot to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, because of the pill\u2019s aftereffects\u2026 My current situation\u2019s the same as yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, as long as we don\u2019t encounter any large beast, we\u2019ll be fine!\u201d Baili Yiling narrowed her crafty little fox eyes with a smile. However, right after she said that, Jun Xin\u2019s brows furrowed and he pulled Baili Yiling into his arms before rapidly rolling to the side.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling was made dizzy from the sudden motion and was completely confused. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>What answered her wasn\u2019t Jun Xin but a beast\u2019s roar.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling stiffened and felt like slapping herself. \u201cCrow\u2019s beak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a crow\u2019s beak!\u201d Jun Xin forced out an unnatural smile as he quickly pushed her up. He then flipped over and got up as well to shield Baili Yiling. His facial color was poor as he stared warily at the beast that had suddenly emerged.</p><br/><p>He was just saying that there weren\u2019t any animals earlier and now a tiger jumped out. It seemed that Baili Yiling wasn\u2019t the only one with a crow\u2019s beak. He had one too.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin thought this ironically.</p><br/><p>When the tiger missed, it didn\u2019t continue attacking and just watched them with its large copper eyes while it slowly approached them.</p><br/><p>A tiger tended to be very cautious. Even when it was just facing a helpless bunny, it would still use all its strength to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d asked Baili Yiling.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin kept his eyes fixed on the tiger. \u201cLook for a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tiger was looking for a chance to attack while they needed to find a chance to escape.</p><br/><p>If Baili Yiling could still use qinggong, it would\u2019ve been a breeze to escape, but now. Jun Xin licked his chapped lips. If he was going to die in the jaws of an animal after all the danger he escaped, he really wouldn\u2019t be able to accept it.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling laughed bitterly. Find a chance? What chance? This was a tiger! It was bigger than the two of them combined!</p><br/><p>It was no wonder why there weren\u2019t any animals nearby. It turned out that this place was this tiger\u2019s territory!</p><br/><p>Roar!</p><br/><p>The tiger suddenly roared towards the two of them, causing a bloody stench to blast over. Jun Xin and Baili Yiling tensed up. It was about to attack!</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and go! I\u2019ll find a way to deal with it.\u201d Jun Xin pushed Baili Yiling to have her leave first.</p><br/><p>Back at the manor, he had also told her to leave first this way.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was this feeling of being protected that caused her to fall in love with this guy despite how he pissed her off every other minute!</p><br/><p>However, this time, she didn\u2019t cooperate and stepped forward next to him. \u201cThis is its territory. I don\u2019t have inner strength or qinggong right now, where could I escape to?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Jun Xin didn\u2019t push her to leave. However, he didn\u2019t respond to her and just reached over to pluck a leaf.</p><br/><p>In reality, it wasn\u2019t that he really didn\u2019t have any way to drive this tiger away. It was just a little troublesome.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling didn\u2019t look at Jun Xin directly, but she couldn\u2019t help but peek at him out of the corner of her eye. When she saw him pluck a leaf, she frowned in confusion. It was easy to drive this tiger away with sound waves, but inner strength was required to make sound waves.</p><br/><p>And Jun Xin had no inner strength at all right now.</p><br/><p>She looked towards him worriedly only to see that he had lifted the leaf to his lips. A strange melody flowed out. She was distracted by this sight so she was caught off guard when something hard seemed to ram her mind. She swayed but was caught by a pair of large hands before she fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cCover your ears!\u201d said Jun Xin coldly.</p><br/><p>Baili Yiling hastily nodded and covered her ears. However, she kept her eyes fixed on Jun Xin. How exactly was he doing this?</p><br/><p>There was clearly no inner strength in that melody, but its imposing strength was no inferior to the sound waves emitted by profound inner strength.</p><br/><p>That originally fierce tiger became hesitant when it heard the melody Jun Xin made. However, it soon shook the hesitation off and fierce light filled its eyes again. It lowered its weight into its hind legs, then abruptly pounced towards the two.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

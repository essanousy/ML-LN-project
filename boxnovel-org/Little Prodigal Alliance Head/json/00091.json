Afterwards though, she didn\u2019t show anymore emotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here? Where\u2019s Yuner? What did you do to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>San Yu glanced inside the room. She only exhaled in relief when she saw that Yuner seemed timid but was otherwise fine. Thus, she turned around to start questioning Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, this is purely a coincidence. A pure coincidence!\u201d Tang Doudou coughed again when she saw that San Yu\u2019s expression was not particularly good. It was probably due to what happened at the competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoincidence?\u201d San Yu swept a mild glance at Tang Doudou. \u201cWhat exactly happened? If nothing much happened, then please leave. This place does not welcome outsiders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, San Yu looked towards the broken roof. \u201cWere you the one that did this to the roof?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a sudden accident. My friend got injured, then just happened to fall from the sky and crash through your roof. I sincerely apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just find someone to fix it.\u201d San Yu\u2019s tone was very calm. \u201cHowever, please take your people with you as fast as possible. I don\u2019t wish to get dragged into any unnecessary trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. His injury\u2019s too severe. He can\u2019t be casually moved right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford to care.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sister San Yu.\u201d Yuner suddenly came out from the house to stand right behind Tang Doudou. \u201cBeautiful Big Brother isn\u2019t a bad person. Just help him a little!\u201dT/N</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful Big Brother?\u201d San Yu glanced at Tang Doudou. Could it be that the Beautiful Big Brother Yuner talked about before was her?</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner, I\u2019ve already told you before that knowing what people think is not the same as knowing their hearts. You can\u2019t casually trust strangers. Why did you forget?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner didn\u2019t forget\u2026\u201d San Yu\u2019s tone was a bit overly stern so Yuner felt a bit wrongly accused. \u201cYuner just, just felt it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because Yuner seemed dejected, or perhaps it was because of the two words \u2018felt it\u2019. In any case, San Yu\u2019s expression softened a little. She lifted her foot and, stepping past Tang Doudou, headed into the room and walked towards the bed.</p><br/><p>When she saw the person on the bed, she abruptly stumbled backwards. She turned with disbelief to look towards Tang Doudou. \u201cWhat? How could it be him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s him.\u201d Tang Doudou shrugged. She was rather curious about San Yu\u2019s reaction so she asked, \u201cSan Yu, you know Baili Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange expression flashed through San Yu\u2019s eyes. However, she soon concealed it and replied mildly, \u201cBaili Yu is famous for being the richest individual in this country. Who in the world does not know of it? How could it be possible for me not to know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou curled her lips, not believing her words at all. However, since the person didn\u2019t want to talk about it, she shouldn\u2019t ask any further. Not to mention, they still needed to request help from San Yu so it was best not to risk irritating her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s Baili Yu, he can stay. It\u2019s fine as long as it doesn\u2019t drag me into trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jesus ah, she\u2019s agreeing this easily?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smacked her lips. In any case, it didn\u2019t matter much. Since she has already given her agreement and Baili Yu\u2019s situation was dire, she\u2019ll hurry back to Plum Garden before worrying about anything else!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen thank you. I\u2019ll return as soon as possible. I definitely won\u2019t cause you trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best if that\u2019s the case! Yuner, come out with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sister San Yu, I promised Beautiful Big Brother that I\u2019ll help him look after this Beautiful Big Sister. Big Sister San Yu, you said so before that if you promise someone something, you must keep the promise. That\u2019s why, I have to stay here and look after her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner, it\u2019s fine. You can just go with San Yu!\u201d Tang Doudou saw San Yu\u2019s face turning stern again after Yuner spoke and hastily pulled over Yuner to persuade him.</p><br/><p>However, San Yu snatched Yuner out of her hand and led him to the corner. \u201cSince you have to watch him, then just watch him properly from here, alright? Don\u2019t go anywhere, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuner nodded without really understanding. \u201cGot it, Big Sister San Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to look for someone? I\u2019ll only allow him to stay here for six hours. If you don\u2019t return after six hours, I\u2019ll throw him onto the streets to face the aftermath himself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I\u2019ll give you a small warning. Right now, there are posters ordering your arrest everywhere. It\u2019s best if you act carefully so as to avoid being captured and not being able to return. Once the time\u2019s up, I will throw him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou estimated that since they were probably still in Huai City, no matter what happened, six hours would be enough to make a round trip. She didn\u2019t waste any time and got ready to head out. However, before she even stepped out the door, Baili Yu\u2019s light chuckle came from behind her. \u201cWife, come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This place probably wasn\u2019t very large. Below her was something that seemed very soft. The stone room was very dark, but there was a sunroof on the left wall of the room. There was a bit of light coming through the window from outside but it wasn\u2019t enough to illuminate much of the room.</p><br/><p>The sunroof was about five to six meters up. Looks like the height of this stone room was not something that could be dismissed!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou retrieved her gaze and glanced around. After confirming that there was no danger, she slowly got up from the ground.</p><br/><p>Taking the antique lamp off her waist, she placed it on her palm and tilted her head back to look above her head.</p><br/><p>As expected, the room\u2019s height was very large!</p><br/><p>Not even the light from the lamp could allow her to see the ceiling. All she could see was a mass of black that resembled an underworld abyss.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou soon switched to looking down and searching for a way to escape.</p><br/><p>After searching all around, all she found was hard rock. Suddenly, she recalled the soft thing she felt when she was thrown in and hastily turned around to look at it. On the ground was an enormous ash gray fox fur coat. The way it was spread out made it look like an enormous fox.</p><br/><p>Fox!</p><br/><p>A light of realization suddenly flashed through Tang Doudou\u2019s head. This fox fur, this fox fur definitely belongs to Baili Yu ah!</p><br/><p>This shape, this softness\u2026 Even though the color was no longer snow-white, Tang Doudou still recognized it in one glance. This was the fox fur from the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin!</p><br/><p>Once she realized this, she started to really panic.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was also in this creepy place!</p><br/><p>That guy was so severely injured. If he had been brought to this place, didn\u2019t that mean he was so dead he couldn\u2019t die any further?E/N</p><br/><p>The more Tang Doudou thought about it, the more uneasy she became. She paced back and forth in the stone room before finally sitting down on the fox fur, helpless and clueless as to what to do next.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, sounds of footsteps came from outside the door. From the sound of the irregular steps, there were probably three or four people.</p><br/><p>For the time being, she\u2019ll just focus on surviving! She can figure things out later!</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

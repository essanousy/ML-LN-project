She glared at Su Yi as she spat out the words, \u201cSu. Yi. You. Damned. Old. Bastard!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere wasn\u2019t good. Su Yi immediately slid down the tree and pointed at her as he said, \u201cLittle girl, you had better be more polite towards me. For better or for worse, I\u2019m still the Master that raised you from the time you were in diapers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! As if I had been raised by you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite-eyed wolf!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two started bickering angrily. Bai Feiyun felt a headache from listening, but he didn\u2019t know which side to help. On one hand, he owed Su Yi a lot. On the other hand, he had made Tang Doudou a promise. It was seriously too hard to choose.</p><br/><p>In the end, the pile of people in front of the door noticed the ruckus and immediately swarmed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe pay our respects to City Lord daren!\u201d The person who was walking at the very front was a person whose influence in Cloud City was second only to Su Yi\u2019s. His surname was Murong and his name was something like Murong Yu. It was said that he was a distant relative of the Murong family in Cloud Sun City. His appearance was actually quite similar to Murong Ming\u2019s and he was also one of the people in Cloud City that disliked Su Yi.</p><br/><p>No wonder Su Yi didn\u2019t bother with words last time before proceeding to beat Murong Ming up until his parents couldn\u2019t even recognize him.</p><br/><p>The people following behind Murong Yu were people she had met before, but she didn\u2019t really remember their names. The only one she remembered was the fatty that was called a Kitchen God, Shi Weitian. </p><br/><p>No ordinary person was capable of living in Cloud City. Murong Yu\u2019s fencing skill was number one in the world, Shi Weitian\u2019s cooking skill was number one\u2026 The one she remembered the most deeply was the guy whose skill at the feminine arts was number one in the world\u2026</p><br/><p>She swept a glance over the crowd, but that exotic person wasn\u2019t there. She couldn\u2019t help but feel that it was a shame.</p><br/><p>Cloud City was very large, but there weren\u2019t a lot of people that actually lived there. Thus, no matter what you shouldn\u2019t look down on anyone within Cloud City. Even a random peddler on the street might have an identity so shocking that you\u2019d wet your pants!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou retrieved her train of thoughts and started listening to what Su Yi and Murong Yu were talking about. The words they had exchanged had already made the expressions of the people around relax quite a bit. Murong Yu said, \u201cSince City Lord already has plans, then please hurry and settle the matter as soon as possible to restore an orderly environment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, at most this matter will only take another half a month. When the time comes, I\u2019ll send people to deliver the things to your residences for you guys. For now, just go. Don\u2019t all gather for no reason. Those who don\u2019t know the situation would misunderstand and think that you guys wanted to blow up my residence.\u201d Su Yi waved his hand. After he finished speaking, he didn\u2019t wait for Murong Yu and the others to reply before pulling Tang Doudou inside the City Lord Residence. Not even Bai Feiyun made it in before the door closed again with a loud \u2018bang.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun calmly turned around and cupped his fist in salute towards Murong Yu and the rest. \u201cSirs, please return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Murong Yu wasn\u2019t happy with Su Yi\u2019s conduct, the person was, in the end, the Lord of Cloud City. No matter how discontent he was, he could only bury it in his heart. In any case, it wasn\u2019t like it had only happened a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d In their eyes, Bai Feiyun wasn\u2019t worth mentioning, so they didn\u2019t bother saying a single polite word before leaving.</p><br/><p>However, Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t mind. He looked into the distance quietly. She had coveted Cloud City for such a long time, she would probably come this time, wouldn\u2019t she?</p><br/><p>Hopefully, she wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey! Xiao Bai is still outside!\u201d After Tang Doudou was pulled into the residence, she saw that there was an evil smile on Su Yi\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t help but shudder. What did this old brat want now?</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, Tang Doudou suddenly recalled a c-c-certain report, the foster father dat the foster daughter ten years\u2026</p><br/><p>Pei pei!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that guy doesn\u2019t have work to attend to? That he should just keep hovering around you every single day doing nothing? He\u2019s just a dumb brat, you shouldn\u2019t pay so much attention to him either. Once you get married, don\u2019t interact with him anymore,\u201d said Su Yi with a displeased tone.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t understand it. What did Su Yi mean by this? The way he was talking was like she was some green tea bitch. She only asked after him because she thought of Xiao Bai as a friend. After all, they had come over together. Now that the guy was shut outside, it\u2019d be way too heartless to not even ask about him!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, I still have to ask you about an important matter.\u201d Just as she was about to explain her earlier words, she heard Su Yi speak with a very serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat important matter?\u201d When Tang Doudou saw how solemn his expression was, the first thing she thought of was that something had happened to Mu Ye. She hastily asked, \u201cIs it that you haven\u2019t found Shen Moru?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about Mu Ye! I just wanted to ask you that, if the husband I choose for you doesn\u2019t turn out to be Baili Yu, what would you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d refused to get married ah!\u201d After she finished speaking, she felt like it wasn\u2019t quite right and supplemented, \u201cEven if you choose Baili Yu, I wouldn\u2019t easily agree to marry just like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yi asked, \u201cThen if it really is Baili Yu, you still wouldn\u2019t marry him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you trying to say?\u201d What exactly was this old guy planning? Wasn\u2019t he the one that was pushing her to get married? How come now it looked like he didn\u2019t want her to get married?</p><br/><p>This time Su Yi didn\u2019t try to distract her by talking around the topic. He indicated for her to sit down, then explained, \u201cRemember when I mentioned the Spring Offering Ceremony in Mist City? That time I had been planning to bring you back with me first, but in the end, I discovered something in that Gu Residence and had to deal with that first. By the time I got back, you had already returned to Huai City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right ah, even I felt that it was strange. What exactly did you see in Gu Residence to make your facial color turn so poor? Afterwards, you ran off without a word. Big Sister Feng Wu\u2019s subordinates told her that you had left Mist City right after that. Hehe, when you went back later, did Big Sister Feng Wu do anything to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! If she was capable of doing something to me, she wouldn\u2019t have foolishly stayed in Mist City for so many years. Hey hey, we\u2019re talking about you. Why did you drag her into the conversation?\u201d As Su Yi protested, a suspicious trace of shyness flashed across his face.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

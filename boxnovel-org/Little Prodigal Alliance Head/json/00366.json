You guys were blown back here one after another.\u201d Although Jun Xin said this, he didn\u2019t seem surprised to see Feng Long and sat down at the table to have a cup of tea. After calming down a little, he said, \u201cBaili Yu has probably taken Tang Doudou to Azure Water Valley. He had mentioned when he got back that Cang Baicao was the one who restored his memories.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Long stayed outside the window. \u201cIs this Master really Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no mistake.\u201d Jun Xin drank another cup of tea. Suddenly, he felt that it was really tasteless. How long had it been since he had drunk alcohol? He could barely remember the taste of it now. \u201cDo you have wine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Long smiled. She untied the wine pouch from her waist and tossed it to him. \u201cYou only drink alcohol when you\u2019re in a good mood, or in a bad mood. Let me guess whether you\u2019re in a good mood today or a bad mood\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to guess. I\u2019m in a bad mood.\u201d Jun Xin pulled out the stopper and took a swig, then rested his head on the table. \u201cFeng Long, say, what is it about me that\u2019s not good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good.\u201d Feng Long gave a very definite reply.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin sighed. \u201cHaha, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m very good, but why doesn\u2019t she like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike, probably isn\u2019t something that can be forced.\u201d Feng Long\u2019s strange eyes turned in his direction. She moved slightly, but didn\u2019t enter the room. Instead, she untied the other jug of wine from her waist and took a sip. \u201cDon\u2019t you miss how it used to be back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin stiffened, then sighed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use in missing it? What\u2019s over is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Hai, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably because he feels hatred! Baili Yu keeps delaying things and refusing to make a move, so he had no choice but to look for someone else. In the end, Yun Hai isn\u2019t the same as us.\u201d When Yun Hai was mentioned, Jun Xin\u2019s eyes filled with irritation. \u201cBut how could he be so heartless! It took me so much resolve back then to go to God Firmament Hall, but in the end, I still hadn\u2019t been able to bring myself to betraying our years of friendship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you\u2019ve said, he\u2019s different from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that you\u2019ve never thought about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Xin, I\u2019m different from you guys as well.\u201d Feng Long interrupted Jun Xin\u2019s words. As she gazed up at the moon, her gaze softened. \u201cYou\u2019re Master\u2019s junior brother. Yun Hai had chosen of his own accord to support Master, but I was someone Master picked up and brought back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful to Master, so I decided a long time ago that my life belonged to him. No matter what you guys do, I won\u2019t betray Master. No matter what decision Master makes, I\u2019ll still obey him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo actually, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s the most loyal.\u201d Jun Xin laughed. Now that he thought about it, he had come back so that Baili Yu could protect Tang Doudou. Everything he did after had been for this purpose as well. Sometimes he would question himself. Had he forgotten about revenge? Had he forgotten what he needed to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I believe Master won\u2019t let us down. I can wait.\u201d Feng Long\u2019s mild voice was like the gentle autumn wind.</p><br/><p>That sentence made Jun Xin\u2019s heart move slightly. He looked over towards Feng Long, only to find that she had actually been looking at him this entire time. A strange thought started to form, but he immediately pushed it aside. \u201cI want to pay a visit to Azure Water Valley.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had known each other for many years, so there was no need for much words for them to understand what each other was thinking. Feng Long concealed the faint light in her eyes and put her jug of wine away. \u201cSince you\u2019ve decided to go take a look, you should rest up for the trip. Yun Hai\u2019s probably too busy dealing with the Alliance Head Residence to pay attention to us right now. Other than hatred, he also has ambition. He really is quite different from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin nodded. \u201cAlright. You should go rest early as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Long was about to leave when Jun Xin stopped her and said, \u201cBaili Yiling is a good lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Long burst out laughing as she glanced over. \u201cJun Xin, when did you learn to play matchmaker? You shouldn\u2019t forget that I\u2019m a lady as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was annoyed. This wasn\u2019t what he meant, alright?</p><br/><p>He threw the jug of wine towards Feng Long, then walked to the window. \u201cI know that you\u2019re both ladies, that\u2019s why I\u2019m reminding you not to tease her. The word \u2019emotion\u2019 can hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe word \u2019emotion\u2019 can hurt?\u201d Feng Long sighed. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that the great Young Master Jun would now know that the word \u2019emotion\u2019 can hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that, she disappeared into the night like a phantom. However, that sentence seemed to wound itself around Jun Xin\u2019s heart and would not disperse.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

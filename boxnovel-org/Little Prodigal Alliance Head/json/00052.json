She then said magnanimously, \u201cCome come, let\u2019s not be so serious. Eat some melon seeds and drink some tea, we can discuss it slowly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other, completely baffled.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou saw that they weren\u2019t coming over and didn\u2019t try to force them. She simply minded her own business and began cracking melon seeds as she said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll just explain it like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs much ability as the Demonic Sect has, they\u2019re just like a brute with only a single spear and horse. A great amount of ants are capable of biting even an elephant to death. So with this many people on our side, there\u2019s completely no need for us to fear their Demonic Sect. As long as everyone unites wholeheartedly to eliminate the huge malignant tumor that is the Demonic Sect from the Jianghu, it would not be an impossible task. As long as we grasp this opportunity properly and hit the mark with one move while they\u2019re unprepared, then victory will be ours!\u201d Tang Doudou shook off the melon seed shells on her clothes, then smacked her lips before saying, \u201cQing Yin ah, bring tea for this gongzi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Yin couldn\u2019t understand what Tang Doudou was thinking so she could only allow her to cause an uproar as she pleased. When she heard that Tang Doudou wanted tea, she hurriedly replied yes then went to find the tea.</p><br/><p>Who expected that the moment she turned to leave, she immediately heard the sound of Tang Doudou inhaling sharply?</p><br/><p>Following that, there was even the sound of Jun Xin\u2019s indignant roar, \u201cLet go of him*!\u201d</p><br/><p>written as \u2018her\u2019 but female and male pronouns sound the same in Chinese</p><br/><p>This startled Qing Yin so much she hastily turned back around to look towards Tang Doudou, but all she saw was that the crowd had gone completely chaotic and were all moving towards the rock that Tang Doudou was standing on earlier. Elder Yu, however, stood outside the crowd and calmly watched all this.</p><br/><p>Then she saw that Jun Xin had appeared from somewhere and was holding Bloodthirster*, which was emitting a blood-colored light, as he also charged towards that rock.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s blade is called the blood-drinking blade, so I searched up that term and it was actually an item in league of legends. So I went to the English version and found the equivalent term. So what do you think? Bloodthirster or Blood-Drinking Blade? Editor-san, what\u2019s your opinion? Q: Bloodthirster definitely packs a certain oomph.</p><br/><p>On that rock, Tang Doudou\u2019s melon seeds were scattered all over the floor. She currently had both her hands lifted as she looked flabbergastingly towards the cold-faced man in front of her.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye?</p><br/><p>Why would the Demonic Sect\u2019s Leader suddenly appear here?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou glanced at the Mu Ye who was only half a meter away and had wrapped an iron chain around her neck. He was currently using that icy pair of cold-blooded eyes to stare at her. Before, in Rutaceae Pavilion, she didn\u2019t notice that this guy\u2019s pupils were actually blue in the flickering lights. Right now, seeing those ice blue pupils matched with his cold expression, it caused people to feel as if they had fallen into an ice cave. She suddenly recalled how she was flung out that day and immediately gave a cold shiver. Her gaze dropped to the iron chain wrapped around her neck. He couldn\u2019t be trying to finish the job, right?</p><br/><p>F**k!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hurriedly slapped this fine thought out of her head and put on a fake smile as she forced out a couple hollow laughs. \u201cSect Leader Mu, how are you? What wind is blowing today, that actually blew you to this one\u2019s humble home. Your presence truly brings light to my humble abode ah, brings light\u2026 haha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t even twitch.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s water-like eyes turned slightly, then she blinked again and asked: \u201cCould it be you\u2019re here to reminisce with this Alliance Head?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Ye still didn\u2019t pay any attention to her. Instead, he lifted his eyes to look towards the attacking Jun Xin. Then applying force with his hands, he pulled Tang Doudou forward to block that bloodsea-like sword aura.</p><br/><p>In midair, Jun Xin hurriedly withdrew Bloodthirster, worried that he would injure Tang Doudou. But he didn\u2019t withdraw it completely. With a twist of the sword tip, he sent Bloodthirster flying like lightning towards Mu Ye through the gap between Tang Doudou and Mu Ye\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t enough time to pull Tang Doudou over to use as a shield again, so Mu Ye twisted the iron chain between his hands and lifted it up to block the striking Bloodthirster.</p><br/><p>The resulting shockwave was enormous and issued out blinding light. It was intense to the point that Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t even open her eyes anymore. I swear a huge freak ah, is this the so-called space-time martial arts? How\u2019s it completely like the mysterious fantasy novels? And it even has colors and waves, it\u2019s seriously fudgin\u2019 frauding poor Beanbeans! Luckily what she said earlier about going to attack the Demonic Sect was just her babbling nonsense. Otherwise, based on her little arms and legs, she\u2019d be crushed just by Mu Ye\u2019s little finger!</p><br/><p>At this time, she could only rain curses on Jun Xin, this stupid imbecile. Can\u2019t he look carefully before attacking!? Can\u2019t he let her finish speaking before attacking!?</p><br/><p>But on second thought, Jun Xin had come to rescue her, he can\u2019t be cursed at ah!</p><br/><p>And so, she decisively gave her respects to the eight generations of Mu Ye\u2019s ancestors.(it\u2019s a way of cursing, \u2018giving your respects\u2019 is sarcastic, it\u2019s more like you\u2019re cursing at all them) Da fudge, if you\u2019re a man then just fight seriously with Jun Xin ah. Taking her, a little girl, as a shield, how is that anything like a proper hero or man!?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou indignantly looked at Mu Ye, the angry flames in her eyes seemed about to flare up.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye seemed to have sensed it as he turned his head to look over and coldly demanded: \u201cHave Jun Xin withdrew, otherwise I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Tang Doudou gave a big eyeroll. Hell, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s her subordinate, is he someone she could command so casually?</p><br/><p>She was just about to correct Mu Ye\u2019s words, but who knew that Mu Ye only continued to speak coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t waste words and challenge my patience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou continued to roll her eyes. A huge mouthful of anger was pressing on her chest, practically choking her to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Dada* Mu Ye ah, Jun Xin is Baili Yu\u2019s subordinate, how is it possible that he\u2019ll leave just because I tell him to leave? Not to mention, our past is quite dark. Eight out of ten chances, he\u2019s probably trying to take advantage of this opportunity to take my life ah! And he\u2019s even borrowing Dada, your hand. He\u2019s seriously hateful beyond belief. You, by all means, must definitely not allow him to get away with it!\u201d Tang Doudou glanced with lingering fear towards Jun Xin, who was still attempting to fight with Mu Ye, then appealed to Mu Ye with a pitiful expression.</p><br/><p>Yup, TDD calls MY daddy in a dialect. Nope, I don\u2019t know why. Actually, Baidu says that in internet usage, it can be used towards friends or towards experts and amazing people as a way to show worship and respect, lol.</p><br/><p>Even though Mu Ye said not to challenge his patience, not to waste words, but Tang Doudou insisted on doing so. After all, if Mu Ye really wanted to kill her, he would have directly done so earlier. With his cold-blooded personality that would definitely not leave an assassination task until five am if he could kill them at midnight, there was no way he\u2019d possibly have mercy or qualms.</p><br/><p>For him not to kill her, there was definitely a reason behind it. As for what that reason was, Tang Doudou could only say, God knows?</p><br/><p>The color of Mu Ye\u2019s pupils darkened as he dragged Tang Doudou and fended off yet another fierce blow from Jun Xin. In his mind, he was currently thinking about what Tang Doudou just said. Then he thought about how each of Jun Xin\u2019s blows were fatal attacks. Originally there were several opportunities to directly rescue the person away, but Jun Xin let all of them slip by.</p><br/><p>It seemed he really didn\u2019t care about Tang Doudou\u2019s life and only wanted his life!</p><br/><p>Recalling those masked men that hindered him these couple days, Mu Ye suddenly arrived at an understanding and laughed coldly. For the sake of the task he agreed to, Baili Yu actually even dispatched Jun Xin. Looks like that item was extremely important to him ah!</p><br/><p>But how could he, Mu Ye, allow someone to snatch something from his hands without paying a price?</p><br/><p>Out of the corners of his eyes his gaze swept towards Elder Yu, whose expression had completely nervous ever since he appeared, and an expression of disdain appeared on Mu Ye\u2019s face. If it weren\u2019t for the sake of defeating that person, why would he ever collaborate with a person like this? Always ruining things and even getting confused by this Li Xueyi\u2019s babbled nonsense to the point that he couldn\u2019t keep his calm. And he was even stupid enough as to work with those below-par bunch-of-trashes in the sect to poison and smuggle away Bai Feiyun. Did he not know Bai Feiyun\u2019s identity? Wasn\u2019t doing this just provoking that person\u2019s fury and directing it towards the Demonic Sect?</p><br/><p>Even though his ability now could not be disdained, it still wasn\u2019t enough for him to be that person\u2019s opponent.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, before he came, he had already ordered the people to release Bai Feiyun. Otherwise, if things continued developing on, even he would find it hard to contain the situation. As for Elder Yu, was his brain that of a pig?</p><br/><p>To want to get the Alliance Head Command Tablet from Li Xueyi\u2019s hand using this as a pretext, how laughable. That plaything was a colossal load of pain. People couldn\u2019t throw it away soon enough yet he was actually rushing up to grab it. He was seriously an unsalvageable moron!</p><br/><p>Mu Ye lifted his brows and refused to look at Elder Yu anymore.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou, who was staring at him this entire time, noticed his minute changes. She saw that trace of disdain especially clearly and involuntarily licked her lips as flowers bloomed cheerfully in her heart. Looks like Mu Ye and Elder Yu\u2019s relationship isn\u2019t that harmonious ah!</p><br/><p>And so, she lifted her hand to jab Mu Ye\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye suddenly turned his head around and his cold eyes were so sharp that she hastily withdrew her hand. Then she looked behind Mu Ye and exclaimed, \u201cAiyah, Jun Xin is attacking again, you should hurry and block!\u201d</p><br/><p>His brows twitched. Did she think he was her bodyguard? But the situation in front of him didn\u2019t allow him time to think further. He immediately turned around to block Jun Xin\u2019s sword, then took advantage of the opportunity to leap up backwards while dragging Tang Doudou along.</p><br/><p>His entire body flew up like an owl to land on top of the roof. Tang Doudou, who still had an iron chain wrapped around her neck, reacted quickly the instant he flew up and used her hands to grab the iron chain. Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t much effect and her gas supply was still almost cut.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Tang Doudou to react any further, Mu Ye landed lightly on the rooftop. Meanwhile, she was ruthlessly smashed into the green roof tile by inertia, causing her five visceras and six bowels to all be ill. Yet she still didn\u2019t dare to loosen her hands because the moment she did, that iron chain would immediately cut off her head.</p><br/><p>However, her fingers were also about to be snapped off.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet, let me down, I\u2026 I\u2019m about to die\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou slid sideways on the roof. Her feet kept scrambling here and there for a hold, but couldn\u2019t find any. On the contrary, the more she moved, the more strength she lost and her facial color was also starting to flush purple.</p><br/><p>The situation changed too fast, no one had time to react before Tang Doudou\u2019s weak suffering voice transmitted over. Jun Xin, upon returning to his senses, immediately also flew onto the roof. Seeing Tang Doudou hanging on the iron chain, his heart abruptly tightened and he furiously shouted towards Mu Ye: \u201cMu Ye, hurry and release her. If there\u2019s anything, just direct it towards me!\u201dT/N</p><br/><p>Qing Yin also snapped to her senses and flew up, landing not far away from Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye shot her a glare and warned coldly, \u201cTake another step forward and I\u2019ll snap her neck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin and Qing Yin didn\u2019t dare to move anymore and could only watch helplessly as Tang Doudou scrambled uncomfortably and glared. They were extremely anxious yet they couldn\u2019t think of any hint of an idea!</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Ye, you clearly know that there\u2019s no use capturing her. Furthermore, her death also brings no benefit for you so why don\u2019t you just let her go. We can discuss what your demands are afterwards.\u201d After calming down, Jun Xin knew that he was too rash earlier. If he didn\u2019t make a move at the start and push Mu Ye into a corner, Tang Doudou wouldn\u2019t end up in such a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>Mu Ye gave a cold laugh and asked: \u201cYou can make the decisions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of her first.\u201d Baili Yu had already handed total control of this matter to him, otherwise he also wouldn\u2019t have returned with Tang Doudou to the Alliance Head Residence. Thinking of what Baili Yu said to him after Tang Doudou left, a trace of a sneer flashed through Jun Xin\u2019s eyes. Mu Ye ah, Mu Ye, for you to want to fight with Baili Yu, you\u2019re way too inexperienced.</p><br/><p>But the current top priority was still to first rescue Li Xueyi. Settling accounts with Mu Ye properly can come later.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, a trace of ridicule emerged in Mu Ye\u2019s ice-cold pupils, \u201cI refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the exchange between the two above her, Tang Doudou really felt like cursing their mothers. F***ing chicken if you keep dawdling like this she\u2019ll really be choked to death, ok!?</p><br/><p>To still have the mood to probe at each other, that\u2019s quite admirable, after all the ones being hanged aren\u2019t those two damned imbeciles ah!</p><br/><p>Silence continued to transmit over from above her head.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt her hand gradually numbing and the iron chain still slowly tightening and started to despair. Her entire head became filled with wild thoughts. How about she just commit suicide by biting off her tongue? At least that looks much better than dying by hanging. They say that the ghost of a hanged person looks extremely horrid. From the start her appearance wasn\u2019t good enough, if it gets a bit worse wouldn\u2019t she become even uglier than a ghost?</p><br/><p>Aaaaah!!!</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t want that! She doesn\u2019t want to become even uglier than a ghost and she also doesn\u2019t want to die!</p><br/><p>Her brain was flooded repeatedly with chaotic moods and thoughts and her head felt like it was about to explode. Following that, an amount of power suddenly surged forth from Tang Doudou\u2019s stomach and rushed towards her chest. It kept incessantly inflating like a balloon, causing her to feel uncomfortable as if her chest wanted to explode.</p><br/><p>She groaned, seriously unable to endure it anymore. The hands grasping the iron chain suddenly tightened as a torrent of power suddenly rushed from her chest to her hands. With a loud jangling clang, the sound of the iron chain breaking accompanied Tang Doudou\u2019s roar as it resonated through the entire Alliance Head Residence, \u201cAH!\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Glancing at that shattered plate of snacks on the floor, she didn\u2019t know how long Bai Feiyun could obstruct Xiao Yiyun. She must resolve this in the shortest time possible.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>From far away, Elder Yu heard this and the color of his pupils darkened. This crowd of matters-wrecking rubbish!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Yet he also couldn\u2019t really turn the conversation over. The current Li Xueyi was like a mad dog, whoever he caught he would bite. Currently, it was still not the time to completely shed all pretense of cordiality with him. This plan did not succeed, he almost must return to properly redeliberate.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xiao Yiyun still hasn\u2019t returned after a long while and recalling Bai Feiyun\u2019s strange skill, Elder Yu guessed that Xiao Yiyun had already been obstructed.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Elder Yu had been angered a lot, but calmed down quite a bit. Even though the great power before his eyes was lost, in reality it wasn\u2019t a huge loss to him. On the contrary, because of this incident, the secret chess pieces that he had arranged would be even steadier. He just had to wait for the right opportunity, then he could thoroughly take control of Cloud City\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>He blew away the tea suds floating in the water. As for Li Xueyi, he\u2019s just a little energetic clown. What harm was there in letting him play around a little longer?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>At most it\u2019d just be a bit irksome.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAlliance Head empathizes with everyone, everyone must also empathize with Alliance Head ah! Fighting hand to hand with that devil isn\u2019t easy ah. Although the Alliance Head described it as breezily as a feather, that was just so that everyone wouldn\u2019t worry. How can you guys be so insensible, forcing the Alliance Head to talk so much. If you guys really cause the Alliance Head to become exhausted, I\u2019d like to see how you guys plan to explain it to the City Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hearing this suddenly come from Elder Yu, everyone froze.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Did this Elder Yu go crazy from being angered by the Alliance Head? He\u2019s actually thinking of the Alliance Head and putting himself in his shoes?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeming to know what they were thinking in their hearts, Elder Yu candidly laughed heartily. Walking over, he said: \u201cAs everyone knows, I, this Yu, has straightforward intestines. Before when I made things hard for the Alliance Head, it was simply because my brain was stupid and believed the rumors in the Jianghu and thought that the Alliance Head\u2019s character was not good so he was not suitable to sit in this position. But from the looks of it, Alliance Head, you\u2019re a very straightforward person that speaks in a refreshingly straightforward manner. Your devotion to righteousness inspires admiration as a youngster with ambition\u2026 What part of you is as intolerable as the rumors say ah?! Sure enough, rumors cannot be trusted, yet this elm wood brain of mine only came to understand this now! There is no one more suitable than you, Xueyi, to sit in this Alliance Head position!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope Alliance Head you, as a great person would be magnanimous and won\u2019t keep this Yu\u2019s former enmity in mind and devote your all together with this Yu to these Martial Arts Circles!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This stream of words was presented in such a way that Tang Doudou was shocked beyond shocked. Da fudge, she, Tang Doudou has gained knowledge and experience again!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This darn old SOB a pei(spit sound)!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>A few words towards her stomping and trampling was enough, yet he still had to be so cruel to himself and diminish himself. At the end of it he even asked her not to hold on to past enmities as if he was highly principled, and even asked to join hands in advancing forward for the sake of benefiting the Martial Arts Circles!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She really wanted to swing a palm over and slap this shameless thing flying.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>His, Elder Yu\u2019s straightforward intestines with nine bends and eighteen twists was spoken of as if it was really straightforward ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Is he treating everyone present as fools?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou indignantly thought, there was no helping it. The other side had already taken the initiative to make peace, if she keeps poking and haggling over every ounce, all the effort she put in earlier would go to waste. At that time, the victim will become the persecution target, even if she wanted to make a comeback it wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Plus, there really was a fool that was helping Elder Yu speak. With just a glance she recognized him, wasn\u2019t it precisely that person who had jumped out first to stop her from ending the convention?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yu labored and performed many meritorious services for the sake of the Martial Arts Circles. He has rushed about for half a lifetime so he is a bit excessively cautious, but this is human nature, it\u2019s only natural.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to think of it, Alliance Head da ren\u2018s breadth of mind is wide, he won\u2019t bother over so much. Elder Yu can just relax and be at ease!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should probably head back first. We believe Alliance Head will definitely give us a satisfactory explanation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The subject of the conversation became more and more harmonious, in the end it even came to the point that they were exhorting Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It was precisely that Mother Mo Yun. She was currently sitting solemnly upright, giving off the arrogant air of a senior as she spoke meaningfully to Tang Doudou: \u201cXueyi, you\u2019ve only just taken the position, there are many things you must learn. Elder Yu had assisted many Alliance Heads before, he has an abundance of experience that we cannot even compare to. You must set down your attitude and properly learn from Elder Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Da fudge! Hearing this, Tang Doudou only felt as if several thousand grass mud horses(f your mom) were wildly rampaging through.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Before, she had even quite liked this Mother Mo Yun, feeling that her three views were very upright. Who knew that before this sentence even warmed up, she was ruthlessly slapped in the face?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hell, in the past the one that opposed her the most, wasn\u2019t it Mo Yun?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Vigorously rising up to admonish Xiao Yiyun and tell him that he was not allowed to say bad things about Cloud City\u2019s Lord, wasn\u2019t that also Mo Yun?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Right now not having any good things to say to her and also helping speak in favor of Elder Yu, was it still her, Mo Wan?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was slammed by weights in broad daylight!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>How many intentions does she have, Tang Doudou just can\u2019t figure it out?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Things having reached this stage, if she still doesn\u2019t say anything, she doesn\u2019t know what other kind of things this crowd of people will end up saying.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>On the surface Tang Doudou was very calm, yet inside, her balls felt like they were breaking.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cMother Mo Yun is right, Xueyi understands!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She\u2019s finished, finished! She won\u2019t be struck by lightning for saying false words, right? Tang Doudou was very anxious.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d Seeing that she took advice very well, Mother Mo Yun felt exceptionally satisfied and came up to pat Tang Doudou\u2019s shoulder: \u201cProperly do it(work hard)!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Alright, she definitely will properly, very properly, do it(f***)!</p><br/><p>Not 100% sure if the second (do sth) is supposed to be a swear word, but it is emphasized so Tang Doudou is either planning something or cursing, or both.</p><br/><p>After Tang Doudou replied with a bright fake smile, she immediately turned around and said to everyone: \u201cSince no one has anymore objections, then everyone should head back home to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She really wanted to immediately beat it!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>However, things just can\u2019t go as one wants. Or perhaps the two words \u2018to sleep\u2019 that she spoke were just too alluring, to the extent that the dear friend that had been sleeping from the start until now stood up with a \u2018whoosh\u2019 and yawned: \u201cCan finally go home to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why is no one leaving?\u201d That person swayed as he walked over, his hair was a complete mess and blocked his line of sight. He lifted his hand to push aside his hair. Unexpectedly, the moment he revealed his face, the sound of sucking in cool air simultaneously filled the hall.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Causing Tang Doudou to be completely baffled.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cSangfroid Prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Qiuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is he here?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Following that was one exclamation of alarm after another.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Nearly all of the people that could sit here were from famous schools on the Jiangu. They had already arrived in Rutaceae Pavilion a day earlier. The ones of circles like the Hall Master He and Syndicate Leader Liu that Tang Doudou saw earlier could only run around outside to rush over here.</p><br/><p>As in, I think the inferior schools are given later notice.</p><br/><p>The ones that came tonight were of Hall Master He\u2019s circle.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>When the servant called out Xi Qiuyue\u2019s name earlier, though quite a few people heard, they were all people that were not worth mentioning. In addition, the servant said there was a problem with the invitation, and Bai Feiyun showed up to handle this matter so no one worried about it.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>They never expected that this Sangfroid Prince would actually be asleep here in the hall and witnessed the entire ins and outs of the convention.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Even more surprising was the fact that though the servant had clearly said that there was something wrong with the invitation, at this moment there was actually someone that recognized this person as the Sangfroid Prince, Xi Qiuyue.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>What\u2019s real what\u2019s fake, it seriously was a nice puzzling question ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Xi Qiuyue? Tang Doudou knitted her brows, a trace of waves rippled through her eyes. A person from the Imperial Household?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>According what Bai Feiyun said before, earlier he was even making a racket to find her?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then this will be troublesome ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Whether it was regarding her or regarding the Alliance Head Command Tablet, these were all matters of the Jianghu. The things put into the pan to stir-fry were all her own family\u2019s vegetables.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But since ancient times, the relationship between the Imperial Household and the Martial Arts Circles has been as incompatible as fire and water. Neither motherfunker* could deal with the other. Couldn\u2019t swallow it down but also couldn\u2019t puke it out, both looked at each other with disgust. </p><br/><p>Tang Doudou uses a lot of less offensive versions of swear words. When it comes that she outright goes completely profane, I will use the most equivalent term.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, as far as one could see, everyone\u2019s eyes were blazing with flames. Their expressions showed that with just one inciting remark they would get rid of Xi Qiuyue\u2019s genitals.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The only one that was different was Elder Yu. His pair of triangular eyes* were already emitting fresh light. Looking at the Sangfroid Prince Xi Qiuyue, his thick beard covered mouth crooked, almost unable hold back a smile.</p><br/><p>Triangular eyes</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Tang Doudou bit her lower lip. Her black agate-like pupils turned towards the unintelligible Xi Qiuyue.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The latter seemed to have sensed something and was just about to turn his head to look over.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>An enormous sound of impact sounded out. The Sangfroid Prince turned his head, stupefied: \u201cWho hit\u2026.. ben\u2026\u2026 ben wang*\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2013 \u201cben wang\u201d way for speaker to refer to himself in third person. Aka, something like \u2018this king\u2019 or \u2018this imperial son\u2019</p><br/><p>His pupils didn\u2019t even make it to Tang Doudou before with a \u2018thump\u2019 he fell to the floor.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou took back the wooden stick in her hands and under the stunned gazes of the crowd patted off her hands: \u201cThe martial arts convention was first infiltrated by people of the Demonic Sect, now it\u2019s been infiltrated by someone from the Imperial Household. It looks like the defenses of Rutaceae Pavilion need to be strengthened!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then, taking advantage of the time before Elder Yu was able to react, she stomped a foot on the Sangfroid Prince\u2019s face: \u201cSomeone come! Drag this guy down for this Alliance Head. When I have time I\u2019ll properly investigate what exactly this Imperial Household is planning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She waited for half a day, yet not a single person came up. Even Elder Yu was silent as a turtle, his shifty eyes filled with the expression of schadenfreude.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was currently subtly changing when suddenly the sound of a flute came from outside. It was melodious and filled the spacious air, traveling over from far away.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Following it, countless fluttering petals made their way in from outside the window, momentarily causing the entire hall to be filled with a sweet fragrance as if meeting spring.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The fluttering petal sea was outside the window in the endless darkness. Suddenly, a faint light shone. Just as they focused their eyes, they discovered with amazement that it was an extremely beautiful and exquisite palanquin chair. Looking a little closer it would be seen that the ones carrying the chair were four beautiful young girls with gauze veils covering their faces. On either side of the palanquin there were even eight more separate young ladies in the same attire, each holding a musical instrument. That melodious flute music was played precisely by that young girl in the lead.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The even more amazing thing was that this procession of people had a ton of petals opening their road and they arrived stepping through the air. It exceedingly resembled the legend of the immortal fairy descending to the world of mortals.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou\u2019s eyes even turned dazed from looking!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jesus! The acting ability needed to appear on scene like this is too, way too high!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Her curious heart was also almost about to fly past the sky. Who in the world was sitting in that palanquin?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The sudden appearance of a procession of people caused quite a few people in the hall to be shocked dumb. The first to come back to his senses and react was actually the Sangfroid Prince Xi Qiuyue. At some unknown time he had come to stand at Tang Doudou\u2019s side. Giving an extremely at odds with the scene belch, he then said: \u201cBen wang has seen quite a few prodigal spendthrifts, but still hasn\u2019t seen someone this crazy. To actually use this many stunning women to carry a palanquin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>In her astonishment, Tang Doudou didn\u2019t notice that the one talking to her was the one she had struck unconscious with a smack of a wooden stick. She nodded approvingly: \u201cTrue. No need to mention those stunning women, just based on the fact they tossed so many flower petals in the dead of winter is already a huge spending of money, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk*, what does this bit count for? Look at that palanquin, that\u2019s the most extravagant squander of money!\u201d Xi Qiuyue shot Tang Doudou a look of disdain, his tone was filled with the connotation that he was very dissatisfied with Tang Doudou\u2019s knowledge and experience.</p><br/><p>Tsk \u2013 sound of clicking the tongue, can be for both admiration or disgust</p><br/><p>\u201cPalanquin? I can\u2019t see anything special about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnorant and inexperienced!\u201d Xi Qiuyue sneered: \u201cCome come, let ben wang expand your knowledge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou followed him and leaned over. Xi Qiuyue pointed at the jade-colored dome on top of the palanquin: \u201cSee that? That was made by polishing an entire piece of top-notch jadeite! It\u2019s extremely rare! Using it to make the roof of a palanquin like this with no other purpose, it\u2019s clearly just showing off wealth! And ben wang dares to guarantee that beneath that palanquin\u2019s roof is definitely a layer of warm jade that costs even more than this jadeite! Sitting inside there on this cold winter day that feeling\u2026 tsk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the body of that palanquin, white shine completely penetrates it. Under the moonlight it presents a hazy radiance, do you know what this is?\u201d Xi Qiuyue cast a sidelong glance towards Tang Doudou, particularly smug.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Looking at Tang Doudou again, she was currently crouching down drawing circles on the floor with exceptional bitterness: \u201cThat\u2019s too much, way too much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

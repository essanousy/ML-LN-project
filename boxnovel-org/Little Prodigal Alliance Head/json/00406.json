He flung off Tang Doudou\u2019s hand and stood up. \u201cHow could it be this poison!? How\u2019s that possible? How\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His repeated cries of disbelief were enough to show that this poison was going to be a problem.</p><br/><p>His voice even became a little flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Cang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk!\u201d Cang Baicao stopped Baili Yu\u2019s questions and started pacing around the room anxiously while muttering.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu had pinned all of his hope on Cang Baicao, so although he was impatient, he had no choice but to remain silent as to not interrupt Cang Baicao\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>Finally, Cang Baicao stopped and stood in front of Baili Yu. His haggard face was filled with strong helplessness. Baili Yu\u2019s heart dropped. Could it be that even Cang Baicao couldn\u2019t do anything about this poison?</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t cure this poison!\u201d Cang Baicao took in how Baili Yu\u2019s body trembled from shock when he heard this. After a moment, he continued, \u201cBut there\u2019s someone that can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hope reappeared in Baili Yu\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao said, \u201cBut there\u2019s not enough time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything that can slow the spread of the poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t!\u201d Cang Baicao shook his head firmly. When he saw the despair on Baili Yu\u2019s face, he hesitated, but still said, \u201cBaili gongzi, there\u2019s something I\u2019m not sure I should say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu was currently very flustered and vexed. If Cang Baicao wasn\u2019t capable of curing this poison, who would be able to cure it?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun?</p><br/><p>Would he help?</p><br/><p>However, if he helped to cure this poison, wasn\u2019t that the same as admitting that he had poisoned her? He wasn\u2019t dumb enough to do that, so there was no way he\u2019d agree to help.</p><br/><p>The more Baili Yu thought about things, the more exasperated he got. However, he couldn\u2019t very take his anger out on Cang Baicao, so he just said, \u201cSenior Cang, feel free to say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn. Baili gongzi, remember what I said about the child last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Cang means?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be more children, but if this poison remains in her body too long, no one can know for sure what will happen. You understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pain filled Baili Yu\u2019s eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t there any other way?\u201d</p><br/><p>But that was their first child!</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao shook his head and continued taking Tang Doudou\u2019s pulse. \u201cThink about it. You\u2019ve suppressed the poison with your inner strength, so you have one day\u2019s time to consider.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu looked at him, then slowly closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>If there were any other ways, even if it required for him to make use of everything including his own life, he\u2019d do it without hesitation to protect the mother and child. However, there was no way, so what could he do? In this moment, he actually felt so helpless. It was the first time he had ever felt helpless.</p><br/><p>He walked outside dispiritedly. He really needed time to think about it.</p><br/><p>Cang Baicao didn\u2019t stop him and allowed him to leave. Once he got far away, Cang Baicao\u2019s expression suddenly changed and a pill rolled out of his sleeve into his palm. He quickly fed it to Tang Doudou, so quickly that his movements were barely visible. When one looked again, his fingers were still on Tang Doudou\u2019s wrist and his eyes were mostly closed as if he was examining something.</p><br/><p>Qing Yin, who was outside, saw this, but it had happened so quickly that she thought she saw wrong. She retrieved her gaze and continued guarding the door quietly.</p><br/><p>Azure Water Valley, along with Baili Yu, sank into a deadlock.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Baili Yiling, who had headed over with the Wind Shadow guards to find Jun Xin, had already arrived in North Hara City. It was already night, so she was exhausted. She talked with the leader of the Wind Shadow guards and had them go look for Jun Xin first. She was going to rest until midnight, then follow the signs that they left.</p><br/><p>However, right after she entered the inn, the Wind Shadow guards came back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you guys back here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReplying Eldest Miss, we\u2019ve discovered Young Master Jun\u2019s tracks!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Baili Yiling heard this, she immediately became more alert and hastily asked, \u201cWhere is he right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard replied, \u201cAccording to what we\u2019ve found, Young Master Jun went to a high ranking official\u2019s residence, but we didn\u2019t find any trace of him inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s already left?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t see any evidence that he left. He seemed to have disappeared in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there any other information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, then you guys can withdraw. I\u2019ll call you if I need anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Wind Shadow guards left. Baili Yiling propped up her chin and thought about things for a while, then decided to go and take a look for herself.</p><br/><p>She had witnessed the Wind Shadow guards\u2019 skill at tracking on her way here. If they\u2019ve determined that Jun Xin had disappeared in that residence, then it was definitely true. However, the fact that a large man disappeared so suddenly just like that meant that there was definitely something up with that residence!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What are you looking for? Hurry up and come help!\u201d When Tang Doudou lifted her eyes she discovered Jun Xin was currently looking at her with an odd expression and she immediately called him over to help. These ancient styled clothing are just a bother, it\u2019s not convenient at all to move about in. Just kneading some dough caused her entire body to be covered with flour.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin rolled his eyes and humphed: \u201cWasn\u2019t it you that told me to keep watch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you keep watch just cause I told you to keep watch, if I told you to go eat shit will you just go and do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go eat shit!\u201d Jun Xin angrily said. The dagger in his hand flashed with cold light and brushed past the side of Tang Doudou\u2019s face, stabbing into the cupboard behind her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Then he coldly warned: \u201cWork faster. Any more words and I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This violent butt-aged little brat!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, I\u2019m just making a comparison. Don\u2019t mind it too much\u2026\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou waved her hand. Not daring to call him again, she went to work busily herself.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWork a bit faster. Once it hits the next hour Meng Yu will come!\u201d After a while, Jun Xin started to urge again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The dagger was still stabbed into the cupboard. Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dare to infuriate him again and could only say with an annoyed tone: \u201cWhat do you keep repeating for? I am hurrying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cMaking something this hurriedly and hastily, is it possible for it to taste good?\u201d Jun Xin saw that she had bustled around half the day yet she still hadn\u2019t made a fire and started to doubt Tang Doudou\u2019s cooking skills again.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou cursed him silently in her heart but her mouth replied: \u201cJust watch your door properly, it\u2019ll be ready in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin gave a humph and ignored her.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Damned tsundere!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Half an hour went by.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it ready or not?!\u201d Jun Xin stood up, unable to wait any longer: \u201cMeng Yu is almost here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost ready, almost ready!\u201d Tang Doudou fished out the thing in the pot and rolled it in the seasoning tray. A fragrant scent immediately filled the air.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Smelling this Jun Xin\u2019s heart tickled with a hard to endure itch. Where did he have the mind to still care about watching the door? He ran over, reached out, grabbed that strip and popped it into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cSsss! So hot, so spicy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>The fragrant spicy taste exploded inside his mouth, a hundred flavors occurring at the same time! But it was really way too spicy, Jun Xin didn\u2019t have the time to reflect on the taste. After swallowing it down in one bite, he stuck out his tongue and fanned it as if his life depended on it: \u201cWhy did you put chili! Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know I don\u2019t eat chili!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Huai City is a region in South Province and they don\u2019t like eating chili. Jun Xin, this locally born and bred Huai City citizen was even less able to stand this spicy taste.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou felt wrongly accused: \u201cYou never said that you didn\u2019t eat it ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin was speechless.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou moved closer and asked: \u201cHow is it? How\u2019s the taste?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin paused for a moment, reflecting on the taste in his mouth: \u201cThe taste is actually not bad, it\u2019s just a bit too spicy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Even though it\u2019s a bit spicy, the taste really was not bad. There was a sort of still wanting to eat more impulse after eating. </p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Helplessly Jun Xin swept a glance at the chili oil filled tray. If it was just a little bit less spicy it\u2019d be perfect.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing his thoughts, Tang Doudou laughed \u2018hehe\u2019 and said: \u201cWait a sec.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin looked at her, not understanding. Tang Doudou lifted her brows and blended some less spicy ones and handed it to him: \u201cHere, eat. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not spicy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Only then did Jun Xin unhurriedly pick up the chopsticks and clip a piece. Hesitantly putting it into his mouth, his expression froze. Immediately, happiness rose to the surface.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Even though it was still a bit spicy, it was within a tolerable range.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>And precisely because it wasn\u2019t too spicy, that savory spice became even more rich. This time when he started eating he couldn\u2019t stop anymore. One piece after another was thrown into his mouth. During an idle time he didn\u2019t forget to ask Tang Doudou: \u201cWhat\u2019s this thing called?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cSpicy strips!\u201d Tang Doudou chuckled \u2018hehe\u2019 as she picked up that extremely spicy plate and put it into a food box.</p><br/><p>Spicy strips</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Jun Xin asked again: \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cMy stomach is full, the tasty thing is also made. If I don\u2019t leave then do I wait here for you to ask me out to eat?\u201d Tang Doudou patted the food box. Walking to the window, she looked outside, then put the food box on the windowsill, about to climb out the window and leave.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good door right here for you to walk through, what are you going out the window for?\u201d Jun Xin knitted his brows, seeing her climb several times but still unable to climb out. He couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes, how could there be someone this stupid in the world?</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen have you ever seen someone steal something then walk out the front door?\u201d Tang Doudou disdainfully humphed. With a push she jumped out. Picking up the food box, she waved her hand at Jun Xin: \u201cButt-aged little brat, I\u2019m leaving first! Byebye~\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Hearing those words, Jun Xin\u2019s face instantly turned black. With a move of his hand, the dagger returned to his grasp.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Seeing this, how could Tang Doudou still hang around and wait for him to make a move against her. Bending down at her waist, she felt along the wall and left.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Butt-aged little brat, don\u2019t blame jiejie for being hard-hearted towards you. Without selling you out, jiejie wouldn\u2019t be able to walk out ah!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Giggling \u2018hehe\u2019, she heard a loud \u2018bang\u2019 sound.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Immediately following that was the sound of Jun Xin\u2019s miserable shriek mixed with an angry howl as if the lioness from Hedong was roaring: \u201cJun Xin you little son of a bitch! You\u2019re here to steal food again! Bastard! Do you know who sent that deer meat!? I\u2019m, I\u2019m gonna beat you to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Don\u2019t hit the face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Moving along the wall to the door, she peeked in. A devastated miserable shriek came through. Tang Doudou\u2019s guts shook and she hurriedly moved far away from the kitchen and walked back to the original road.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cLi gongzi!\u201d </p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Just as she walked out of the courtyard she heard Qing Yin\u2019s surprised call.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Before she even had the time to stand steadily, the pretty figure appeared in front of her: \u201cLi gongzi, I\u2019ve finally found you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin, you came just in time. Hurry and bring me to Baili Yu!\u201d She was just fretting that she couldn\u2019t find someone to bring her to find Baili Yu, this Qing Yin really came just at the right time.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin wiped the sweat on her forehead and replied: \u201cLi gongzi, Master isn\u2019t here in the garden right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cNot here?\u201d Tang Doudou looked at the food box in her hand, disappointed.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Following her gaze and looking over, seeing the box Qing Yin curiously asked: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something good!\u201d Tang Doudou reached out and was just about to open the lid of the box when she suddenly froze: \u201cQing Yin, can I ask a favor of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no harm in gongzi stating it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cI made some food, can you help me send it to Baili Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>He\u2019s saying, the stuff in this food box was made by him? Qing Yin was quite surprised and asked: \u201cGongzi disappeared for half the day without a trace, it was to go make something to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou handed the box over to her: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about so much. Just help me send it to Baili Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin\u2019s expression was troubled and didn\u2019t take the food box: \u201cThis, Meng Yu jiejie has always been in charge of Master\u2019s food. This servant doesn\u2019t dare make a decision without permission. If you want to gift it, it\u2019s best if gongzi goes yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say he wasn\u2019t in the garden? If he\u2019s not in the garden, how am I supposed to gift it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned little bastard, you still dare to run! When I catch you, see how I\u2019ll sort you out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>At this time, a black figure flashed over the wall and dropped down in front of the two.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Xin, why are you here?\u201d </p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>If the person that dropped down wasn\u2019t the Jun Xin Tang Doudou left behind in the kitchen to distract Meng Yu, who else could it be? By this time, he had long lost his earlier arrogance. When he heard Qing Yin\u2019s voice, he immediately rolled over here: \u201cQing Yin, hurry and save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing his pathetic appearance, Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Qing Yin helplessly asked Jun Xin: \u201cJun Xin, did you steal food again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, the one that stole food was him! I\u2019m being framed!\u201d Jun Xin heard Tang Doudou\u2019s laugh and recalling how she abandoned him in the kitchen while running off alone got angry to the point he couldn\u2019t breath properly. Pointing at Tang Doudou he said: \u201cBaili Yu\u2019s pot of deer meat was all eaten by him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about that deer the Chamber of Commerce sent over this morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other one is there?\u201d Jun Xin covered his face. Everytime, she(Meng Ru) always hits his face, too hateful!</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin, you\u2019re also here?\u201d Sounds of \u2018thump thump thump\u2019s transmitted over. Tang Doudou looked over and only saw a five larges three coarsesG woman panting as she ran out from the courtyard. From the looks of it she was probably around thirty. The two enormous lumps in front of her chest bounced back and forth with her running motions. Every step roused a giant amount of dust, yet her speed was still very fast. In a blink she got to them, gasping so heavily for air that Tang Doudou couldn\u2019t even open her eyes.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>It was hard to imagine that Meng Yu was actually such a heavyweight lady.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Yu jiejie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp, help me catch that brat! Master, Master\u2019s deer meat was secretly eaten by him! Too hateful! I already told Master not to let him in yet Master just refuses to listen every single time! Now it\u2019s just great, he steals food every single day! Seriously infuriating me to death!\u201d Meng Yu ferociously put her hands on her hips as she rained curses.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Jun Xin poked his head out from behind Qing Yin\u2019s back. Rubbing his eyes, he said: \u201cMeng Yu, don\u2019t frame the innocent. Your deer meat was secretly eaten by this brat, it has nothing to do with me at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! When I entered the kitchen I saw you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cause he sneaked away first!\u201d Jun Xin furiously glared at Tang Doudou: \u201cStinky little brat, you dare to eat but you don\u2019t dare to admit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This dumb little brat, selling her out just like this. She wasted so many of her spicy strips bribing him! Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. Seeing Meng Yu also glare over, she immediately exposed an extremely innocent expression: \u201cWhat deer meat? What are you guys talking about? I can\u2019t understand any of it? Hey, that guy whoever you are, we\u2019re total strangers, don\u2019t randomly try to accuse me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>This string of words were spoken exceedingly bold and confidently with the sound of justice on her side. Jun Xin\u2019s eyes flipped over, almost fainting from the anger.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung. Fellow. Jun!\u201d Meng Yu fumed with rage between gritted teeth.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Yin!\u201d Seeing that Meng Yu had already decided it was him, Jun Xin immediately grabbed Qing Yin\u2019s sleeve and pitifully pleaded: \u201cHelp me, it really wasn\u2019t me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Even though Jun Xin was beaten by Meng Yu to an inch of his life, but his identity wasn\u2019t simple at all. Of all the people at Baili Yu\u2019s side, there was only Meng Yu that dared to yell and beat him like this. And it\u2019s just because Meng Yu\u2019s culinary skill was seriously good and Jun Xin was also a gluttonous guy. Yet he just wouldn\u2019t eat at the proper place and insists on running to the kitchen to steal food and even has to choose the food Meng Yu specially prepared for Master. Over time, every time Jun Xin came here to steal food it would be noisy to the point chickens fly and dogs leap.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>After a long time of this, everyone got used to it.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>But yet this time Li Xueyi also got mixed up in it. Meng Yu didn\u2019t know but she knew. The food box in Tang Doudou\u2019s hand was precisely the one that Meng Yu often uses to carry the Master\u2019s meals in.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Even though Jun Xin liked to pilfer food, he would admit it every time he was caught. So for this incident to not be related to Li Xueyi, she, Qing Yin didn\u2019t believe it at all.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Yu jiejie, I think we should just let this go.\u201d </p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cLet it go?\u201d Meng Yu\u2019s voice got even louder, thundering to the point that everyone present had to cover their ears: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me to just let it go! Then Master\u2019s blame, who will bear it for me! And that\u2019s an extremely rare nine color deer, it\u2019s an ingredient I might never have a second chance to work with in this lifetime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>When she spoke to the end, her loud voice started sobbing. Her shaking as she sobbed frightened Tang Doudou to the point her heart trembled and trembled.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuuwwuu\u2026\u2026 Do you guys get it?! Do you get it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Meng Yu cried pitifully, in the end she collapsed to a sit onto the floor. Jun Xin scratched his head, particularly uncomfortable. He shot another glare at Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou actually did quite understand Meng Yu\u2019s feelings. When a good cook encounters a rare ingredient, it\u2019s like when an old Buddhist monk who hadn\u2019t seen any females for a few dozen years sees a drop dead beautiful lady; they can\u2019t stop themselves.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by LazyMiyu, Proofread by Ocelot</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>G = it\u2019s in the glossary it you need it~</p><br/><p>Glossary</p><br/>\n</div>"}

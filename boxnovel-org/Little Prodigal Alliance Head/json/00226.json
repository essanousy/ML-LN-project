How could you have allowed someone who was not in your plan to appear? Baili Yu, you\u2019re really becoming more and more untrustworthy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Xin, I don\u2019t want to repeat myself. He really wasn\u2019t part of my plan.\u201d Tang Doudou was the only one he could stand patiently explaining himself to. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he felt guilty towards Jun Xin for what happened back then, there was no way he would have restrained his temper again and again. However, now that Jun Xin had repeatedly expressed disbelief, his tone turned cold.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that Jun Xin didn\u2019t believe Baili Yu, but that Tang Doudou\u2019s disappearance made him very vexed and there was no other person for him to take his anger out on. Thus he threw all the blame on Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Yuner saw that the atmosphere was becoming worse and worse so he asked quietly, \u201cThen where do we go now to find Beautiful Big Sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person he asked was Baili Yu.</p><br/><p>Since he knew that it was the black-clothed man who took Tang Doudou away, he definitely knew their current location.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been poisoned, so there\u2019s only one place he would go,\u201d said Baili Yu slowly as he looked down towards Cloud City.</p><br/><p>Right after he finished speaking, Jun Xin disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuner, say, was my choice really correct?\u201d Though Jun Xin left, Baili Yu didn\u2019t immediately follow and instead, asked Yuner this.</p><br/><p>It was Yuner\u2019s first time facing this terrifying man on his own. He was scared and nervous, and couldn\u2019t understand what exactly Baili Yu was asking. However, there was a voice that was crying out nonstop in his heart.</p><br/><p>He gulped, then forced himself to speak despite the fact that his throat felt dry. \u201cI-I think t-that, what you did, w-was right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baili Yu smiled. For a moment, his bright eyes made the world seem dim in comparison. As his white robe and black hair lifted in the wind, an imposing aura emitted from his body. \u201cWhat does right or wrong matter? Regardless of whether it was right or wrong, the choice has already been made\u2026 What else matters? Weren\u2019t they all just for the sake of a reaching goal?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were correct. Regardless of whether a choice was right or wrong, it was simply an event that existed in the process of obtaining a goal. It was just that when a person\u2019s standpoint was different, differing viewpoints of what was right and wrong would occur.</p><br/><p>By the time Jun Xin got to Cang Baicao\u2019s courtyard, Tang Doudou had already woken up.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was talking with her as they sat beneath the large tree in the courtyard. However, when Bai Feiyun saw Jun Xin, a strange expression flashed through his eyes. It quickly disappeared, but he stood up and said, \u201cYou guys should talk. I\u2019ll go see if the medicine\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, he smiled towards Jun Xin in greeting and headed into the small room on the side.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin only let out a breath of relief once he saw that Tang Doudou was safe and sound. Then he sat down and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>It would be great if she knew what had happened! All she remembered was that she had been shocked unconscious by Yuner. By the time she woke up, she was already in Cang Residence and the poison had been cured.</p><br/><p>She had asked Bai Feiyun who had brought her here but he said that he didn\u2019t know. He said that he had headed out for a little while, and when he got back to his room, Tang Doudou had been lying on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring it up anymore. If I knew what happened, I wouldn\u2019t be so depressed.\u201d She yawned, then glanced at Jun Xin\u2019s attire. The way he was dressed today made people\u2019s eyes light up. Those slender and long legs were especially attractive, to the point people practically couldn\u2019t shift their eyes away. \u201cYou\u2026 why are you dressed like this? Oh, and how did you know that I would be here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin smoothed back his hair and shot her a flirtatious glance. \u201cI picked this outfit out really carefully, you know. How is it? Awesome, right? Don\u2019t I look handsome? Very elegant and cool? Don\u2019t you feel like you\u2019re falling in love with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell? Hasn\u2019t spring already passed?</p><br/><p>Her heart went numb from the flirtatious glance Jun Xin shot at her and she looked at him like she was looking at a freak. \u201cAre you having a mental illness flare up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin burst out laughing and reached out to rub her head. \u201cStinkin\u2019 woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou slapped his claw aside and looked up at him with a serious expression. \u201cDid you know that this was going to happen today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin\u2019s smile instantly disappeared. He sighed and sat down next to her.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou looked over. His delicate and straight waist was even more alluring than his legs. She couldn\u2019t deny that his appearance today was really breathtaking. Most of the time he was wrapped in a wide robe, so his figure couldn\u2019t be seen at all. She hadn\u2019t expected that this brat would actually have quite an impressive figure.</p><br/><p>With this, she had no way of treating Jun Xin like a little kid anymore. She couldn\u2019t help but feel that it was a little weird.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin didn\u2019t try to hide things from her and told her everything that happened today in detail. However, he didn\u2019t talk about catching that person in the back mountain and simply said that he had to rush somewhere to deal with something important. He also said that her appearance had been a complete accident. She actually wasn\u2019t part of Baili Yu and Nangong Yan\u2019s plans.</p><br/><p>So it meant that she had actually gotten herself involved in this?</p><br/><p>Even though Jun Xin had explained things this way, she still felt uncomfortable. Regardless, Baili Yu had made use of her.</p><br/><p>He had also left her behind to go off on his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about you? How did you know that I was here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe told me,\u201d replied Jun Xin honestly.</p><br/><p>See? It was that man. Everything was within his plans.</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin saw that she seemed unhappy, he said with a smile, \u201cEverything\u2019s fine now so don\u2019t think too much. It\u2019s fine as long as everyone\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything else to do, come with me to look at Nangong Yan?\u201d Jun Xin stood up and extended a hand towards her with a nefarious smile. \u201cI heard that she\u2019s already going crazy at Blue Moon Lake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer original plan was to have someone poison Baili Yu, then step out to cure his poison so that Baili Yu would owe her a favor. Following that she would pull out Master\u2019s secret order and have Baili Yu go back to Wind Cloud Island.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Master of Wind Cloud Island has long since wanted to get the two together. If Baili Yu really went back, he\u2019d definitely be forced to marry Nangong Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was shocked to hear all of this. She never imagined that the show of going to play on the lake actually contained so many schemes. The ancients were truly terrifying!</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you appeared, Baili Yu decided to beat her at her own game and also move his plan ahead. As for Nangong Yan, since you\u2019ve shown up there was no way she could let go of this opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only thing was, Nangong Yan hadn\u2019t thought that her plan would be just child\u2019s play in Baili Yu\u2019s eyes. Not only did it fail, she fell into a trap herself.\u201d When Jun Xin spoke to here, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s go. If we\u2019re too late we won\u2019t be able to catch the show!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Tang Doudou wasn\u2019t in a good mood, she still felt quite interested in seeing a certain bad person run into bad luck.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go let Bai Feiyun know.\u201d</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

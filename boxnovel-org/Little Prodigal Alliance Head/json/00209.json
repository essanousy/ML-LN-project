I don\u2019t even know who I should listen to anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the use in worrying over that? Just associate with whoever you wish, think as you wish!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always easy to say but not very easy to do.\u201d Tang Doudou counted her thoughts on her fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the events before I lost my memories, nor do I care about what I thought about those two back then. What I feel now is that neither of them are bad people. They treat me quite well too. Even though I\u2019m not the brightest, I can at least distinguish between those who treat me well and those who don\u2019t. The only frustrating thing is, why does everyone have to keep so many secrets? Couldn\u2019t everyone just be a little more honest?\u201d</p><br/><p>How much of it was a scheme? How much of it was sincere!?</p><br/><p>\u201cStinkin\u2019 woman, you\u2019re thinking of it way too simply. Some things can\u2019t be resolved just by being honest. This involves several hundred years of grudges and grace. You should just focus on handling your own matters well and live each day to the fullest.\u201d Jun Xin smiled. This was exactly what he had expected from her. However, this was also good. It\u2019s always the more simple minded person that led the happier life, this has always been the case. He would rather watch her enjoy these simple happinesses than to have her get caught up in those conflicts.</p><br/><p>This was the reason he opted to confess those things to her. However, after revealing everything, he discovered that she didn\u2019t mind those things at all.</p><br/><p>This was probably the good that resulted from her losing her memories?</p><br/><p>\u201cI also want to do that, but trouble insists on seeking me out even if I don\u2019t go looking for it! If it were up to me, I\u2019d get far far away from the Jianghu and then open a small restaurant or something. When I have free time, I\u2019ll cook a little something or stroll around to flirt with young ladies\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou longingly looked towards the blue sky, her eyes filled with little stars. Everytime she thought about that kind of life, she would be captivated and continue daydreaming for quite a while.</p><br/><p>As Jun Xin watched, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little. He\u2019d guessed that she probably didn\u2019t have much ambition, but he hadn\u2019t imagined it would be to this degree. It was enough that she didn\u2019t want to be the martial arts Alliance Head and also didn\u2019t seem interested in being the Lord of Cloud City, but who knew how Su Yi would react if he found out that the person he had carefully nurtured for twenty years just wanted to be the idling boss of a restaurant?</p><br/><p>However, Jun Xin realized that it was exactly the kind of life he yearned for as well after thinking about it carefully.</p><br/><p>Peaceful and tranquil, with tasty food everyday too\u2026</p><br/><p>The two that were originally still walking had stopped at some point and sat down on a roof. They both propped their chin up with their hands as they gazed towards the distant swirling clouds, where the horizon and the clouds melded into one.</p><br/><p>With some birds flying through the sky, the scene was exceptionally calming and tranquil!</p><br/><p>\u201cRumble\u2026\u201c</p><br/><p>An inharmonious sound suddenly appeared. Annoyed with the interruption, Tang Doudou immediately pointed at Jun Xin and said, \u201cIt\u2019s your stomach that\u2019s growling!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was clearly your stomach that was growling. Stinkin\u2019 woman, don\u2019t randomly fling accusations at the innocent!\u201d Jun Xin also looked at her with distaste. The sound earlier had clearly come from her direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! You think I wouldn\u2019t know if my own stomach growled? It was definitely your stomach! If you were hungry, you should\u2019ve just said so, it\u2019s not like I\u2019d laugh at you!\u201d However, even as she spoke her voice became a little unconvincing. Earlier she had been too dazed out to hear whether it was her or Jun Xin\u2019s stomach that was growling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, based on what you\u2019re saying, I don\u2019t know my own stomach?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! In any case, it was your stomach!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Xin saw her huffing childishly like this, all his accumulated stress seemed to disappear. \u201cThis young master won\u2019t lower himself to a woman\u2019s level!\u201d</p><br/><p>His remark was responded with just another cold humph from Tang Doudou.</p><br/><p>They continued to sit on the roof for some time. They both stayed silent and didn\u2019t seem to want to head back.</p><br/><p>\u201cStinkin\u2019 woman, from what I see, you\u2019re also hungry. How about I go get us some food?\u201d Jun Xin broke the silence first and took the initiative to get up.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou hastily stood up as well. She was indeed really hungry ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going to get the food? I don\u2019t want to head back yet.\u201d The reason why she didn\u2019t want to head back was naturally because she didn\u2019t want to see Baili Yu. She really wanted to just stay here quietly like this for a while longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go back, then let\u2019s just not.\u201d Jun Xin shrugged, unconcerned. He had already predicted this.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, they\u2019ll definitely be worried.\u201d After all, she had run out blindly. There were all sorts of people that had come to Cloud City, and many that wanted her dead. Although Jun Xin had come after her, she hadn\u2019t sent them any news for a long time. If it were her, she would also be really worried.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin started to ponder. As of now, Su Yi had probably sent people to scour the entire city for her. Jun Xin said, \u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll send them a signal and tell them that you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfterward, you can just head back whenever you feel like it!\u201d</p><br/><p>This suggestion made Tang Doudou happy to the point where her smile curved her eyes into arcs. \u201cHehe, then what are you still waiting for? Hurry and send it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Xin shook his head as he detached the things needed for sending the signal from his waist. He identified the direction, then shot the signal towards the sky. Magnificent fireworks burst forth in the air. Against the clear blue curtain of the sky, it was extremely beautiful.</p><br/><p>Before Tang Doudou had time to appreciate it in detail, she was pulled along by Jun Xin as he jumped off the roof. \u201cA lot of people will see the signal and guess that I was the one who sent it. We have to hurry and leave in order to avoid the informants that come to investigate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou agreed. However, soon another problem occurred to her. \u201cThen, where do we go now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo find a place to eat! Don\u2019t worry, if nothing else this young master has plenty of money. I won\u2019t make you pilfer food!\u201d Jun Xin saw disdain appear on Tang Doudou\u2019s face when he was halfway through his words, so he quickly dug out some banknotes and shoved them into her hand as proof.</p><br/><p>However, Tang Doudou simply gave him another look of disdain before she tidied up the stack and tucked it away. \u201cCloud City doesn\u2019t use banknotes. Could it be that you\u2019re not aware even after having stayed in Cloud City for that long?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Jun Xin stared at her blankly for a moment before he scratched his head and said, \u201cI just got here today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? Then if I hadn\u2019t been stabbed by Nangong Yan a month ago, you wouldn\u2019t have made it to my matchmaking competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a genuine event anyways, who cares if I didn\u2019t make it in time?\u201d said Jun Xin with a laugh.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou was surprised. \u201cHow do you know that it wasn\u2019t genuine? What if Su Yi was serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the use in him being serious? If you refused, all that he would be able to do was watch. You\u2019re seriously dumb. Enough wasting time, hurry up and say what we should do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>How was she supposed to know?</p><br/><p>She gave this unreliable guy another fierce, disdain-filled glare, then glanced around. When she smelled the faint aroma of cuisine, she suddenly proposed sneakily, \u201cHow about we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Jun Xin rejected the idea righteously.</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

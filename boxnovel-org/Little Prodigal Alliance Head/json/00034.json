Looks like not only was it not low, he was actually even quite valued.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou bit her finger: \u201cLittle brat, can you do it or not ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Getting annoyed being pressed by her, he asked Steward Ding: \u201cDid Bai Feiyun say who he came here to look for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did, he\u2019s here to look for Alliance Head Li. It seemed like it was regarding the Alliance Head Residence\u2019s matters, it seemed quite urgent. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s probably some important and pressing matter.\u201d Steward Ding said.</p><br/><p>Something important and pressing? Jun Xin looked at Tang Doudou again. Even if Bai Feiyun came, and even if there was a pressing matter on top of it, this Li Xueyi was already lying on the bed and couldn\u2019t end up doing anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall for a servant to bring Bai Feiyun here, just say that Alliance Head Li is at this side.\u201d He was worried that Steward Ding would take the trip again himself. It didn\u2019t matter if the speed was slow, but if he ran and got in an accident, how was he supposed to explain it to Baili Yu?</p><br/><p>So Jun Xin exhorted again: \u201cRemember you have to send for a servant to bring him here. You\u2019re already a bag of old bones, so you can\u2019t move fast. It\u2019d be bad to delay the matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Steward Ding\u2019s face turned dark. Giving a light sigh, he agreed and then slowly and unhurriedly started to head back.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin watched him until he got far away. After thinking about it for a moment, he turned around to ask Tang Doudou: \u201cYou\u2019ve already lost your memories, will there really be any use looking for you regarding the Alliance Head Residence\u2019s matters?\u201d</p><br/><p>So it turns out that he was actually doubting her abilities?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like she really lost her memories, at most she just didn\u2019t know a lot of things. But her IQ was high, ok? Let\u2019s not mention that she was able to beat that old scheming Elder Yu, it\u2019d be a piece of cake for her to crush this brat Jun Xin.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou inwardly roasted him, but her mouth didn\u2019t want to move half an inch. She seriously was tired ah.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t speak and Jun Xin muttered a little more. Thinking that she had fallen asleep, he went to stand at the entrance to wait for Bai Feiyun to arrive.</p><br/><p>Not long later, he saw a snow white garment appear not far away and he glanced at the white gowns that were thrown all over the floor by Tang Doudou. Why is it that everyone from this Alliance Head Residence likes to wear white?</p><br/><p>With this bit of distance, Bai Feiyun soon drew near.</p><br/><p>And behind him there was even a tail following. If it wasn\u2019t Steward Ding, who else would it be?</p><br/><p>Jun Xin saw his elderly movements as he supported himself holding a tree, almost unable to walk any further, and Jun Xin almost was not able to restrain his anger.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun approached and slightly nodded his head towards Jun Xin as a greeting: \u201cYoung Master Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>From the looks of the two, it looks like they actually knew each other.</p><br/><p>Jun Xin moved to the side, opening up the path: \u201cAlliance Head Li is inside the room, you should go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun also didn\u2019t speak anymore. Sweeping aside the gown in front*, he walked up the steps and directly entered the room.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not sure how to describe it but this movement is often done in historical dramas. I guess it\u2019s like lifting your skirt so you don\u2019t trip but since guys want to be manly, they just sweep it to the side so it lifts a little and quickly ascend the stairs. It\u2019s a short flight of stairs, usually two-three steps.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou originally had her eyes closed to rest but when she heard Bai Feiyun\u2019s voice she immediately opened her eyes and saw that familiar white figure walk towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai\u2026\u201d Tang Doudou called with deep emotion.</p><br/><p>Hearing that tone, Bai Feiyun\u2019s steps slightly paused. His expression was a bit unnatural as he cupped his fist in salute: \u201cAlliance Head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop dawdling, come over here and check if I\u2019m gonna die!\u201d Seeing Bai Feiyun, she couldn\u2019t help but feel her nose sting.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun also could see her abnormality. Collecting his thoughts, he lowered his eyes and turned around, but Jun Xin already knew things would be like this. With a wave of his hand, Jun Xin closed the door then his footsteps gradually grew further away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened for you to end up like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring it up anymore!\u201d Tang Doudou tried to sit up but Bai Feiyun moved over to press on her shoulders, indicating that she should properly stay lying down.</p><br/><p>Extending his large gentle hand, though Bai Feiyun\u2019s brows seemed a bit anxious, he concealed it very well as he gently said to Tang Doudou: \u201cExtend your wrist, I\u2019ll help you take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, Tang Doudou obediently extended her hand. The moment Bai Feiyun saw that hand that was bound up like zongzi(dish consisting of rice and filling wrapped in bamboo leaves) and couldn\u2019t help asking astonishedly: \u201cHow did your hand get injured as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>He remarked that it was strange silently. Even though it was an excuse that Baili Yu said he brought him here so he could rest and recuperate from his injuries, but no matter what he was still unlikely to go so far as to mistreat him. So where did all these injuries come from?</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou saw the puzzlement between his brows get even deeper and the two good-looking slanted brows were almost scrunched entirely together, so she said: \u201cAhem, it was all from my carelessness. Help me check if I caught a cold first, if I did then prescribe some cold expelling medicine. As for this injury on my hand, help me rebandage it later. That Jun Xin simply doesn\u2019t know how to bandage injuries at all and just randomly bundled it up. I don\u2019t know if might end up inflamed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She spoke longwindedly, but Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t reply. The movements of his hands hadn\u2019t stopped this entire time as he first checked her pulse to confirm her condition, then he carefully started taking apart that gauze that was wound on loop by loop.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fell in the water in this kind of weather so it\u2019s impossible not to catch cold. In a bit, after I help you re-treat your injury, I\u2019ll find someone to boil the medicine for you. Drink it according to the prescription and you\u2019ll get better very soon. You don\u2019t have to be too worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun took apart the gauze as he consoled Tang Doudou in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Tang Doudou was a bit surprised and asked: \u201cDidn\u2019t you come here to bring me back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun\u2019s hand movements slightly pause, but in a blink started busying again: \u201cFor the time being if you can stay away, then it\u2019d be best to stay away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Elder Yu and that group of people still won\u2019t give up? Could it be they\u2019re still planning something?\u201d Other than this she also couldn\u2019t think of any other possible reason.</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun replied: \u201cLast night they weren\u2019t able to achieve their goal so for a while they won\u2019t make any other moves. Not letting you go back is because of other reasons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat reasons?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun took off that last loop of gauze. Looking at that terrible wound his brows bunched together again: \u201cThis injury of yours was also soaked in water?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was actually a lot of resentment towards her in his tone, as if he was blaming her and asking why didn\u2019t she properly protect her injury.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was all an accident. I never expected that so many things would happen either.\u201d Tang Doudou could only say it like so.</p><br/><p>Only then did Bai Feiyun\u2019s expression ease a little as he continued replying to Tang Doudou\u2019s question: \u201cIt\u2019s regarding the Cloud Sun City\u2019s matters. That household was obstructed by someone I sent last night so they couldn\u2019t appear in the martial arts convention, but unexpectedly they appeared outside the Alliance Head Residence today at dawn, causing a noisy disturbance and demanding that they be given a clear explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you said it wasn\u2019t Elder Yu and the rest?\u201d Tang Doudou pouted. Seeing Bai Feiyun space out looking at the injury on her palm she couldn\u2019t help but worriedly ask: \u201cIs it really serious?\u201dT/N</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t soaked in water it would have been much easier to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this just waste of words? It\u2019s already been soaked in water so couldn\u2019t he say something more practical?</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun spoke again: \u201cWhen I headed out today I didn\u2019t expect that you would be injured so I didn\u2019t bring my medicine box. In a bit I\u2019ll give you a pill and alleviate the symptoms of your condition for now. When I return I\u2019ll get the medicine and have someone bring it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>At some unknown time while he was speaking, an additional familiar MYLIKES had appeared in his hands. Just as he was about to hand it to Tang Doudou, he stopped his movement and said: \u201cRemember you must drink it with water, don\u2019t dry swallow it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cough, that can\u2019t be blamed on her. It\u2019s all because of those brainless television show leading the poor students astray ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cDry swallowing makes inhibits the effect of the medicine because it\u2019s hard for it to spread. Don\u2019t you often feel your legs weak as if they lack strength these days? That\u2019s caused by the Tendons Softening Powder.\u201d Bai Feiyun continued.</p><br/><p>She has seriously been enlightened, he\u2019s a godly doctor ah! Tang Doudou\u2019s watery eyes shone as she hurriedly nodded and asked: \u201cIs there any way to make it so my legs won\u2019t be weak?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>She had been really puzzled as to why her legs kept going soft these days, she never thought it was actually the Tendons Softening Powder haunting her.</p><br/><p>She never suspected the Tendons Softening Powder because she had taken Bai Feiyun\u2019s medicine earlier. Due to that, she thought she was already fine and just threw this incident to the back of her mind. But looking at it now, these residual effects were probably because she dry swallowed the medicine so it couldn\u2019t completely take effect.</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun said: \u201cEven if there was there\u2019d be no need for it. In a few more hours the effects of Tendons Softening Powder will be gone and you\u2019ll return to normal. For the time being, you should stay in bed and properly rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true, so Tang Doudou immediately agreed. Then, recalling the reason for him coming she asked: \u201cYou said I shouldn\u2019t go back for the time being, then why did you come to look for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to borrow the Alliance Head Command Tablet to use.\u201d Bai Feiyun was very direct.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou didn\u2019t dally either: \u201cI don\u2019t have the Alliance Head Command Tablet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun was taken aback but in an instant understood. Looking at that revealed pale injury with an abnormal red color, his brows creased: \u201cThe injury is a bit troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know I had the Alliance Head Command Tablet? Earlier I said I didn\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou watched as Bai Feiyun turned her hand back and forth to examine the injury and hissed in pain: \u201cCan it still be treated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe treatment for this injury can\u2019t be delayed any longer, I\u2019ll go back to the Alliance Head Residence and bring the medicine box over, then discuss matters with you. You take the pill and rest for now!\u201d Bai Feiyun very decisively stood up: \u201cThe Alliance Head Command Tablet was sent over by Baili Yu but from the looks of it, he didn\u2019t give you the real Alliance Head Command Tablet.\u201d</p><br/><p>This little white is sure smart enough ah!</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou smack her lips in appreciation. Earlier, the Alliance Head Command Tablet that Baili Yu gifted to her in that small box was indeed fake; the real one had always been in Baili Yu\u2019s hands. After entering the carriage, Tang Doudou immediately found out about this. This is also the reason she was extremely guarded against Baili Yu. This damned bastard, to even say that he was gifting her the Alliance Head Command Tablet out of the kindness of his heart but he actually made a fake one to deceive her. If back then she was truly taken over by deep gratefulness and accepted that box rather than getting a brain twitch(brain stopped working) and returning it to him, afraid that by now she would have already been exposed by Elder Yu for having a fake Alliance Head Command Tablet and swiftly kicked down from the great Alliance Head seat. She might have even been charged with the crime of masquerading as the Alliance Head and Li Xueyi, then dealt with with a single swoosh of a blade.</p><br/><p>Just thinking of this made her entire body emit cold sweat.</p><br/><p>So close, luckily she, Tang Doudou, saw through it. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t even know how she died.</p><br/><p>Baili Yu is very dangerous, Tang Doudou once again added a heavy stroke(of a brush) in her heart.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Tang Doudou didn\u2019t speak, Bai Feiyun knew that his conjecture was probably as close as eight and nine were to ten: \u201cYou\u2019re staying here so you must be very careful. You must keep in mind the things that you should and should not say and remember by all means never to offend Baili Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that everything he said was for her sake, Tang Doudou cutely nodded her head and said: \u201cYou should head back first to grab your medicine box. If there\u2019s anything else we can talk about it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Yet now Bai Feiyun exposed a troubled expression: \u201cI\u2019m just afraid the next time I head over it won\u2019t be that easy to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</p><br/><p>Just then it was because this injury urgently needed treatment, but now thinking about it carefully, to be able to come in to see Li Xueyi was only because Baili Yu wasn\u2019t in the garden right now. When Baili Yu came back, he definitely won\u2019t let him see Li Xueyi.</p><br/><p>And the reason for that was simple, his identity was way too sensitive.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit complicated. Once you get better I\u2019ll explain to you in detail. Since you\u2019re not in possession of the Alliance Head Command Tablet, I\u2019ll just have to think of some other idea. In a bit you should have Jun Xin find a doctor to help you deal with this injury. Once things are dealt with properly I\u2019ll come again to bring you back.\u201d Bai Feiyun muttered to himself irresolutely for a while before finally saying this slowly.</p><br/><p>Tang Doudou became unhappy.</p><br/><p>Would other people\u2019s skill in treating her injury be as good as his, Bai Feiyun\u2019s?</p><br/><p>Even if you used your toe\u2019s brain to think it would still be impossible ah! Fudge, adding on the fact that Jun Xin was that unreliable, he might end up finding her some quack doctor\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOut of the question!\u201d Without needing to think Tang Doudou rejected Bai Feiyun\u2019s plans in one shot. Seeing the latter look puzzled, she explained with a meaningful and heartfelt tone: \u201cXiao Bai ah, look, my days here are seriously not good at all. Look at how long I\u2019ve been here and my whole body\u2019s already covered with injuries, and that was still when I was fine. Now I\u2019m already like this, if they wanted to do anything to me, I won\u2019t even have the ability to resist ah! It couldn\u2019t be that you have to heart to just watch as I get harmed to death by others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Feiyun didn\u2019t think that much and opened his mouth, just about to try persuading her.</p><br/><p>When the door was kicked open with a \u2018bang\u2019. Jun Xin angrily rushed in: \u201cLi Xueyi, can you even feel your conscience* saying this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aka how can you say that without guilt?</p><br/><p>__________</p><br/><p>Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by MrPriest, Proofread by Ocelot</p><br/><p>[Chiyomira\u2019s Corner]</p><br/><p>Author: Didn\u2019t come late right?

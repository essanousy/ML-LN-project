After returning Instructor Marlin to his home and asking Charade to call the academy herbalist over to look at Potterfang\u2019s wounds, Lorist let out a breath of relief.</p><br/><p>Pulling on the rope that was connected to a bell in the management office, Lorist called Kelly over and instructed her to look after Potterfang and his children for the next three months. He let Potterfang and his children use the guest room on the first floor while Reidy took his luggage to the servant\u2019s room on the ground floor and went to look after the Zeno Horses afterwards.</p><br/><p>After everything was settled, an hour had already passed. Lorist also asked Kelly for supper to be prepared for the group before sitting down on the couch in the lounge. Bringing over the a bottle of unopened macks extract, Yuriy put an iron pot into the fireplace in the lounge and started making the drink and added milk and honey crystals into the pot nonstop. After a while, a thick, fragrant smell spread throughout the whole house and even lured the two children and their father upstairs to come down.</p><br/><p>Pouring the children one cup of macks each and telling them to go check out what Kelly was cooking for supper in the kitchen, Lorist started describing the whole encounter with the assailants to the group, including the fact that one of the assailants said that their junior apprentice brother wanted them to take only one of Lorist\u2019s arms. However, Lorist had no clue about anyone he had a grudge with.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one has has a grudge against you?\u201d Charade said derisively before coldly laughing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about vengeance or anything you know. You might not have realized it, but you\u2019ve already become a huge pain in the neck for many people, especially so with the case of the duels. Your relationship with most of the Silver ranked instructors of the academy was already bad enough, and right now, it\u2019s not an overstatement to say that you\u2019re an existence like that of a nightmare for the other Silver ranked instructors in the whole Academy Sector. After only dueling for a month, you have already defeated all the Silver ranked instructors from 13 academies. It\u2019s quite possible that the ones whose turns are next wish to cripple you to end this whole dueling event prematurely.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the challengers that don\u2019t represent the academy, do you know how many people have lost fortunes for betting against you? During the last month itself we managed to get a profit of 18000 gold Fordes from the betting pool! I bet many of them are hoping that you will lose so that they can earn some of their money back. For that, they won\u2019t hold back at all and will throw everything they can at you. From today onwards, you must be really careful for your safety. The Enforcement Division will have a group of people following you at all times to ensure that nothing bad happens to you. Terman, send some elites from the Swordsmanship Society to accompany Locke as well. With that many people following him around, I doubt that many will dare to cause any sort of trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d replied Terman.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that, it\u2019s horribly inconvenient for me to have so many people following me in and out all the time! It\u2019ll be fine as long as I don\u2019t leave the academy right? I\u2019m pretty sure that I can keep myself safe here at least,\u201d said Lorist quickly. I can\u2019t have a horde of people by my side all the time! Imagine how it would feel when I need to go to the washroom!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile it is indeed safer in the academy, it is still not completely foolproof. Don\u2019t worry Locke, I\u2019ll just have the people follow you around in secret without crowding around you. If we don\u2019t do at least that, the old bastard will really give us a harsh scolding by the time we report the incident to him tomorrow. Who asked you to be such a precious money-maker for the academy? The old bastard is quite fond of you, you know.\u201d The group laughed out loud when Charade said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really have to let him know about it, right? Can\u2019t you not spread it at all?\u201d asked Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must definitely let the news get out as best as we can! That way, we can let the others who are plotting against you to rethink their plans. If we were to keep this hidden, it\u2019ll only let them think that you\u2019re afraid of future attacks and they\u2019ll try even harder to hurt you!\u201d said Charade. \u201cAlso, Els, make sure you get rid of the corpses of the assailants and spread the word that they ran away after seeing reinforcements come for Locke, but still managed to injure him quite badly. Put a bounty of the two if you have to. Make sure nobody knows that they were killed by Locke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Els didn\u2019t understand why Charade wanted that done.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lorist already had an inkling on Charade\u2019s plan. \u201cSol, the fatty\u2019s going to rip people off again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Charade said, \u201cIf word gets out that Lorist managed to kill 2 Gold ranked fighters, then who would continue to bet on his loss?! Think about it, who would bet on a Silver rank\u2019s victory against someone who has killed two Gold Swordsmen?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d said Els as he slapped his head in understanding. He then asked, \u201cFatty, would anyone believe that Locke survived the attack unhurt as he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade suddenly had an idea and turned to look at Lorist, then to Yuriy before saying, \u201cYuriy, get me a chicken tomorrow morning. We\u2019re going to help Lorist with his \u2018injuries\u2019. Brother Locke, I\u2019m afraid that you will have to play along with us in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist furrowed his brows and said, \u201cHey, you guys are really too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201dIt\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll just say that you got injured during the assault and wrap you up in some bandages and sprinkle some chicken blood on it. Oh, and Terman, notify the herbalist to not tell anyone about Lorist\u2019s condition unless they pay up. And in the event that they do, make sure the herbalist says that Locke got the injuries Potterfang currently has. Locke, try harder to show that you\u2019re hurt in the duels during the morning and make them think that you\u2019ll be unable to keep up. Hehe\u2026 Think of all that money that\u2019ll fall into our pockets!\u201d Charade and Els\u2019s eyes radiated a golden light.</p><br/><p>Even though this method was rather shady, Lorist didn\u2019t oppose to it since he would be getting a cut of the profit anyway. As for the ones who would lose their money to the betting pool, he couldn\u2019t care less about them and even believed that they deserve it for not having the eyes to discern his true abilities.</p><br/><p>Charade poured another cup of macks and continued while sipping his drink. \u201cI have two suspects in my mind who could have plotted the attack just now. One of them is the Saint Marceau Academy. The academy challenging Locke tomorrow, the Clearwater Academy, shouldn\u2019t be much of a threat to him. However, the 15th academy that has accepted the challenge, the Saint Marceau Academy is our academy\u2019s number one rival. That\u2019s why they are my prime suspect. Then again, if they were involved in this, I doubt that they\u2019d send those two losers to deal with it. It doesn\u2019t fit the academy\u2019s modus operandi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist raised a voice of objection. \u201cHey, those two were One Star Gold ranks you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, they are still losers for having been defeated by you. If I were there, maybe I would even manage to kill one of them myself,\u201d boasted Charade.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Based on the junior assailant\u2019s performance, Lorist had to admit that Charade did make some sense and that he would probably win if he fought against the junior one. Apart from being very good at dodging, the junior assailant didn\u2019t leave any other impression on Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is another person I suspect,\u201d said Charade. \u201cDo you remember Sandoz?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d asked Lorist while shaking his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2026\u201d Charade was totally frustrated. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that once before? It\u2019s that assistant instructor that riled up the dual elite course students to surround and attack you whom you later beat up, remember? After recovering, he got accepted by the Kalia Kingdom\u2019s Sword Saint as a disciple and he\u2019s now at the peak of the Silver rank. This time, he\u2019s back at the academy to duel you for revenge! Sheesh, I even reminded you about him once before you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, his name was Higuita or something, right?\u201d said Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sandoz Hirda, not Higuita,\u201d said the fatty as he fervently shook his head. \u201cYou even got the name wrong\u2026 It seems that you really don\u2019t hold him in any regard at all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist\u2019s face reddened in embarrassment. Due to being dragged along by a friend to watch a soccer match in his past life, the goalkeeper Higuita left quite a deep impression on him. Now, they very sound of Hirda\u2019s name makes him think of that goalkeeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can be seen that this fellow is exceedingly ruthless in his methods from how he gathered all those people to beat you up three years ago. Even though he should be quite confident in defeating you during the duel, given his background as a noble, he should be quite adept at using some other underhanded plot to make his victory doubly certain. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he dares to try something sinister. The next open match will be the 12th one and he\u2019s on the challenger list of your 14th open match. He would probably be trying something within the next few days to weaken you before the match. The only thing that I still can\u2019t figure out is the origin of those two Gold ranked Battle Force badges. It doesn\u2019t seem like they were issued from the Kalia Kingdom either\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh well, let\u2019s stop worrying our minds over something like this. With my capabilities, no matter what kind of trick this fellow pulls, it\u2019ll be useless just like what happened with the assailants just now. It\u2019s getting late, so we should all be getting some rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSol, you\u2019re only an Iron rank yet you dare to claim that you\u2019re capable? For your safety, I will be staying over at your place tonight just in case. You do have an extra bed, right?\u201d asked Charade. Now that Lorist was an important piece for his money-making scheme, Charade had to make sure that he would not come to any harm.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, the other servant room is already occupied by Kelly. You can either use the couch or sleep on the floor,\u201d replied Lorist.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Brad, the Clearwater Academy Head, heard about how Iron Locke, the Silver Undefeated, had been ambushed on the way home the night before by two One Star Gold Swordsmen. Even though help ended up coming for him and forced the two assailants away, Lorist didn\u2019t fare that well either and had incurred some injuries.</p><br/><p>This was music to the academy head\u2019s ears. His only complaint was that they didn\u2019t manage to take his life too. Should that have happened, the Clearwater Academy\u2019s awkward problem would instantly vanish! What a shame! Academy Head Brad gave a long sigh and sent people to the Dawn Academy to check if the duels will still be held today or not, with the actual aim being to find out the extent of injuries incurred by Lorist.</p><br/><p>Academy Head Brad decided that if Lorist really was hurt badly, he will not agree to postponing the duel to another day and insist that Lorist would lose by default for not showing up. If he didn\u2019t do something like this in Lorist\u2019s moment of weakness, there was no saying whether the Clearwater Academy would become laughing stocks like the other 13 academies before them. Given that Lorist had defeated all 260 of the Silver ranked instructors from the previous academies, Academy Head Brad was quite certain that his instructors wouldn\u2019t fare much better either. He was rather pleased by the timely attack that had put Lorist at a disadvantage. It\u2019s better if he doesn\u2019t show up at all and concede his victory. Well, even if he plans to fight, I\u2019ll have to make sure to encourage the 20 instructors representing my academy to do their best, thought the academy head.</p><br/><p>If the 20 Silver ranked instructors couldn\u2019t even defeated an injured Iron rank, then the logical conclusion would be that the instructors of the Clearwater Academy were useless weaklings. Academy Head Brad wallowed in frustration once again and decided that he would sack these Silver ranked instructors should they all lose to Lorist.</p><br/><p>Without much delay, the people he sent came back with the news that Iron Locke would not be postponing the date of the duel despite the Dawn Academy\u2019s advice to do so. He was quoted saying that he was only going to fight against Silver ranked instructors and not Gold ranked instructors so there was no need to move the duel to another day even though he was injured.</p><br/><p>This news worried the Academy Head Brad as he wondered if it was intentionally leaked by that old bastard of the Dawn Academy. However, the people he sent to the herbalist paid 1 gold coin for information that stated he was indeed hurt. The herbalist even described the injuries Lorist had incurred: there was a slash wound on his left shoulder and a stab wound around his right upper torso. He even stressed that while those wounds posed no threat to his life, it would affect Lorist\u2019s mobility quite visibly, especially the one on his right torso, which has made it hard for Lorist to even lift his arm and would require at least two months to recover completely.</p><br/><p>Academy Head Brad excitedly brought the instructors of his academy to the Dawn Academy for the duels only to return in the afternoon filled with anger and frustration. Even though the battles were all pretty close and the Silver ranked instructors of his academy had gave the best of their efforts and performed far better than they would usually have, for some reason, all of them lost by a hair\u2019s breath. For some reason, Iron Locke\u2019s luck was just that good and he managed to gain victory by the narrowest margin despite his impaired mobility.</p><br/><p>In the case of the last battle, he even managed to win by using the scabbard he had cast on the ground before the duel started. Who would\u2019ve expected that with his longsword knocked away, he would be able to pick up his scabbard and sheath his opponent\u2019s sword in it when the attack came and swing his shortsword to his opponent\u2019s neck? Nobody would be satisfied with a victory like that! It was merely a stroke of luck!</p><br/><p>Aside from Academy Head Brad, the other academy heads also wore unpleasant expressions when Levins received a report from the finance department of the Dawn Academy.</p><br/><p>The report stated that a group of instructors lead by Instructor Marlin had purchased 100 gold coins worth of betting tickets while the members of the Swordsmanship Society had bought 300 gold coins worth as well with the Enforcement Division also chipping in 500 gold coins into the betting pool. The reason was that they wanted to show support for Instructor Locke who has so adamantly decided that he would continue dueling despite having been injured the night before.</p><br/><p>After the duels in the morning ended, the finance department of the academy had to pay out 180 gold Fordes of reward for the 900-gold-Forde bet whereas the money earned for the audience tickets and the ones who bet on Lorist\u2019s loss only amounted to 63 gold coins, 1 large silver and 3 small silvers. That meant that the academy had incurred a loss of over 116 gold Fordes for the day.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the Dawn Academy Head issued a new notice that stated that the finance department would no longer be accepting bets for Instructor Locke\u2019s victory. That meant that people could only bet on his loss in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, who would be so dumb to hand their money over to the academy like that?\u201d said Charade as he threw the notice into the trash.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He said the Union had changed a lot. The guilds were drawing away from one another, which made it very hard to get them to agree to anything. Duke Cobleit, the nominal leader of the group had fallen sick and had not attended any of the meetings. He had only recently started recovering.</p><br/><p>The remnants of the Alliance had started making moves on the Union\u2019s territory after their defeat in front of Bluwek. The trouble occupied them for quite a while, and forced them to keep their word and hand over Walinya\u2019s territory to the windstorm swordsaint, which quelled the Alliance\u2019s ambitions.</p><br/><p>Lorist had to admit the Union had handled the trouble with the Alliance quite well. They used Walinya and its title to kill several birds with one stone. By giving it to the swordsaint they fulfilled their obligation to him, tied him to them, and put an end to the Alliance\u2019s ambitions for its old territory.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t quite understand why Magrut didn\u2019t just declare independence the moment he arrived in his new fief. That had been his expressed intent on the mountain, at least. The Union must have offered him additional benefits. It would certainly sway him. He now had his own territory, but it was ravaged by years of war, so he needed resources and money to build it back up.</p><br/><p>Duke Peterson only briefly touched on the Union\u2019s plans for the future. But he did take quite a lot of space to put forth his proposal. He proposed Lorist double or triple the prices of his products; he was selling them way too cheap.</p><br/><p>Lorist could contain his laughter when he read it. He was clearly trying to win back the market monopoly Lorist threatened with his goods. Free advice on how to make more profit? Did he really think Lorist was so greedy?</p><br/><p>If he raised his prices, the products would lose their competitive edge and the Union would push him out of the market. He didn\u2019t care about profit right now. He wanted to win market share. He could push his prices up later, right now he needed a foundation in the south -- loyal customers and a reputation. Another reason was to force the Union out of the market, or at the very least force them to sell their stuff at much lower prices. This way he could ensure that they would take decades to recover, if they ever did.</p><br/><p>How could they still call themselves the Forde Trade Union when they were no longer real traders, much less the best on the continent? They were now just nobles slightly better at trade than others. It was his duty as one of the exemplar nobles on the continent to guide them down the right path and made sure they became proper nobles and left their trading and merchant days behind them for good. He couldn\u2019t care less whether they wanted to or not, he had decided that was how it would be, so that was how it would be.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo they don\u2019t want to surrender, heh? Even after I give them such a good spanking?\u201d Lorist spat as he waved Duke Peterson\u2019s letter, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why... Shouldn\u2019t merchants be smart and cunning? Why do they so stubbornly refuse to lower their heads? How could the old Union afford to continue this war? Do they really think they can mount a counterattack? Do they still have the ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tarkel bowed respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWord from Twinhead Dragon\u2019s dominion is that Duke Cobleit has recovered and has returned to his duties. The chaos has come to an end. Apart from Chikdor, who completely ignores orders now, the others stand firmly behind the duke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chikdor was the only one to come out relatively unscathed. They were in the rear and were the first to retreat so they escaped without much loss. They were now the strongest force in the Union and had become arrogant. Even worse, they plundered everything all the way back to their dominion, including others\u2019 lands.</p><br/><p>Wessia was the worst hit. Chikdor abducted many of their best smiths and ores when they passed through their land. Most of the guilds wanted to punish them severely, a few had even called for their expulsion from the Union.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, this is rather smart of Chikdor, hey? They fled as soon as they got even the smallest whiff something wasn\u2019t right and even made a profit on the way home. The rest can\u2019t do anything about it either since they are too weak right now. It\u2019s destroyed their trust of each other though. No one will let another group move a large force through its land, or be willing to commit a majority of its forces to a campaign and leave its homeland unsecured. They\u2019re too afraid someone else will try the same thing,\u201d commented Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Your Grace. Apart from Forde, Riwald, and Wessia, the three guilds who lost their dominions, the other 20 second or third rate guilds who lost their territory as well still stand firmly with Duke Cobleit. Apart from them, Mayflower and seven other guilds formed a separate faction that blames the duke for everything. They\u2019re calling for his removal as the nominal leader of the Union.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur informants say Peterson is treated like an outsider. He has chosen to remain neutral, but has in turn be ostracized. He has rejected the mission you gave him. He\u2019s chosen to stand with the Union, whichever road they take.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he had trusted the wrong person, then?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they up to anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Duke Cobleit has formed a force, 100 thousand strong. He\u2019s stationed them in Gudlink, Mauvlin, Sanganworb, Hasmok, and Klinkus. Besides that, nothing is happening in those provinces, it seems they intend to turn them into wilderness, a buffer between us and them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist looked at the map and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cA wise decision. If they developed them again, we could just storm in, defeat their garrison forces and raid it. But if they leave them be, it\u2019ll become a difficult stretch to pass through and dissuade us from attacking them without the resolve to see this fight through. And without any infrastructure, even if we make it through, we\u2019ll have weak supply lines. And it\u2019s not like we\u2019d let them redevelop them, anyway. They\u2019re too close to the Falik Plains. If only Duke Cobleit was not their leader, this would all be over already. He is too wise for his own good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have two other pieces of news,\u201d Tarkel continued, \u201cThe duke will be hosting a meeting with the landless guilds to get them new lands in the south of the Union\u2019s territory.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe south is largely barren, left fallow since the Union took it. It\u2019s also been almost completely depopulated by the war. The people don\u2019t like the Union, they\u2019ve been nothing but bad news since they went there, so they\u2019ll be very hard to govern. It doesn\u2019t help that Chikdor is close-by. Most of the guilds are demanding they be given land elsewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other information concerns a communique the duke sent to the Alliance and Jigda. He\u2019s been trying to turn them against us. They want them to stop trading with us and ban our products and stand with the Union against us. They\u2019ve not-so-subtly hinted at us being a new Krissen Empire and tried to paint themselves as the rest of the continent\u2019s protectors yet again,\"</p><br/><p>Lorist burst out laughing again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are either incredible optimists or suffering the worst case of delusions I\u2019ve ever seen. What nonsense is this about protectors? If anyone is the new Krissen Empire, they are! There used to be 36 countries in the Alliance. Thanks to the old Union there are now just 16, 17 if you include the now-independent Jigda.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Grace needs not worry. The Alliance has seen through them completely. Their previous aggressions, coupled with us not swallowing the territory we captured, but instead forming the new Union has won them over to our side, or neutrality, at the very least. There\u2019s also the matter that our products are far better than the Union\u2019s, and far fairer priced. The old Union is just showing its desperation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should still teach them a proper lesson,\u201d Lorist said, stroking his chin, \u201cThe army is too busy to deal with them this year\u2026 Maybe we should raid their territory next year after the rainy season. Oh, investigate something for me. I want to know what nations the territories of the five provinces belonged to. See if you can track down their descendants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Your Grace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, hasn\u2019t Senbaud been sinking all the Chikdor vessels he encounters? I heard their people have been forced to buy fish since they can\u2019t fish along the coast anymore. Tell Senbaud to contact Chikdor and offer to stop sinking their ships if they declare independence from the old Union and form a kingdom. We\u2019ll also let them trade in Morante. He can use my name to guarantee the windstorm swordsaint won\u2019t take action.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist secretly returned home at the end of the 8th month.</p><br/><p>Sylvia gave birth to a healthy boy on the 11th of the 10th.

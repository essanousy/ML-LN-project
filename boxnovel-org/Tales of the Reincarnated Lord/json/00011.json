The second and third forms of the Bright stage prioritized unleashing the eight extraordinary meridians and linking it with the twelve standard meridians to form the Major Cycle to achieve a state of robust vitality and harmonizing the polar energies of Yin and Yang within the body.</p><br/><p>Following the unleashing of the eight extraordinary meridians, it would only take a few months to unleash the Yangwei and Yinwei meridians, after which one can train in the third form of the Bright stage, the Robust Warhorse. Lorist had not reached this level before in his past life. This technique he had inherited from previous family was pretty beneficial after all. The astonishingly fast training speed of the Aquametal Technique was so great a source of joy for Lorist that he forgot he was using Battle Force to train in it and made him feel extremely hopeful of his progress in the future.</p><br/><p>But Lorist, deeply engrossed in his training, did not pay attention to the way others around him viewed him. He went to the academy as usual to attend his courses as well as coach his students in swordsmanship. Eventually, he stunned everyone in the academy with the 100% success rate of his first Battle Force awakening course.</p><br/><p>Lorist met his first love since coming to this world around this time. Their similar history with their respective families served as a pivot for their growing intimacy and motivated them to strive and build their own happy future.</p><br/><p>Nothing much changed until that day when Lorist had a talk with the fat, Deathly Miser.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, fatty\u2026 Aren\u2019t you looking at me a little funny? Is there something on my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel sorry for you. I don\u2019t know if you even know about it\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you feeling sorry for? Isn\u2019t my life fine as it is right now? I don\u2019t need your sympathy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? You say you\u2019re fine as you are? Locke, let me ask you. How long has it been since you\u2019ve trained your Battle Force?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, about that\u2026 It\u2019s true that I\u2019ve been neglecting my Battle Force training. But that\u2019s hardly my fault. My family\u2019s Battle Force attribute is totally different from that of a majority of Battle Force techniques. And, given that I don\u2019t have the rest of the manual, I couldn\u2019t train in it even if I wanted to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you gonna do? Are you going to remain at the Three Star Iron rank forever? You\u2019re gonna wait for the conflict in your homeland to subside before reaching out to them for the rest of the technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shrugging his hands in futility, Lorist said, \u201cWhat else can I do? It\u2019s not like that\u2019s getting in the way of my current life so I\u2019m not in too much of a rush.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSheesh, you\u2026 Can\u2019t you just try harder?\u201d said the fatty solemnly. \u201cDidn\u2019t Instructor Claude say that you should continue to train in your Iron rank Battle Force until it reaches the peak density in your veins and go experience some life threatening battles? You might be able to stimulate the full potential of your Battle Force amidst the heat of battle and break through to the Silver rank even if you\u2019re using the hexagram circulation path for the Iron rank. Brother, you\u2019re already at the peak of the Iron rank. Perhaps, if you took another step and got a little push, you might just break through and become a Silver Swordsman! You can\u2019t just give up like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. What are you so worried about? I\u2019m passing my days just fine, why would I go out of my way to go fight life-and-death battles? I can afford to wait a few years. Who knows if I might encounter a high-ranked magical beast and perish if I did decide to go train\u2026 That\u2019s not a decision I can make lightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you\u2026 You\u2019re still so young, where has your ambition gone? You were not like this before. High rank magical beast aside, you were fearless and not hesitant at all when you pulled out your sword and faced off with five Silver ranked attackers. Magical beasts should be even easier to handle than the likes of men. Let\u2019s go to the mercenary guild and find a suitable date to go training and complete some missions in the meantime for some quick cash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shaking his head adamantly, Lorist said, \u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of time now. I have my hands full with the academy and helping Wenna with her business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenna was Lorist\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s nickname.</p><br/><p>Charade let out another bitter sigh. \u201cLove and women are the downfall of great heroes. Didn\u2019t you say that yourself? Look at the you now. Ever since you started dating Wenna, you\u2019ve never left Morante City even once! You can\u2019t go on like that! You are definitely a person with a bright future ahead of you. Don\u2019t just idle about and waste your life away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, don\u2019t don\u2019t have such high expectations for me you cursed fatty. To be honest with you, I don\u2019t have any great ambitions myself. I only desire to get a large house on Brinn Hill when I earn enough and settle down there with Wenna and live out the rest of my life in bliss,\u201d said Lorist as he laughed.</p><br/><p>Brinn Hill was located somewhere to the south of Morante City and was near the Golden Bay. It had great scenery and was one of the most expensive areas in the city to live in. Only the richest of the rich could afford to reside there.</p><br/><p>Charade shook his head and said, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about tens of thousands of gold for a mansion on Brinn Hill. I think you\u2019re much better off spending only a few thousand gold coins to get a four-storey building in the southern sector of the city and collect some rent while you\u2019re at it. There\u2019s nothing good about the sea breeze on Brinn Hill either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade faced Lorist and continued solemnly, \u201cThen again, brother, you should really make more effort in your training and get to the Silver rank quick so that nobody can say anything about your abilities. I\u2019m only telling you this for your own good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling a little suspicious, Lorist asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is there something I should know about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, the Silver ranked Instructors in the academy are probably plotting something. I think they want the academy to fire you as a swordsmanship instructor because of your Iron rank Battle Force. They think you\u2019re not fit to be an instructor for an academy that\u2019s ranked the top ninth on the whole continent. That\u2019s all I have to say. You go back to see your Wenna if there\u2019s nothing else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprised, Lorist exclaimed, \u201cWhat the heck! What does my Battle Force rank have anything to do with them? They can\u2019t make me resign as a swordsmanship instructor! Even with their Silver Battle Force rank, there\u2019s no one among them who can match up to me in a duel!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for people to get jealous,\u201d said the fatty faintly, \u201cEven with your Iron rank Battle Force, they wouldn\u2019t mind if you had better swordsmanship than them. What they didn\u2019t expect was that all the students in your Battle Force awakening course successfully awakened their Battle Force. Not only was this a miracle, it made them feel even more worthless. How do you think they\u2019d feel when they can\u2019t even match up to an Iron rank instructor? They won\u2019t be satisfied until they kick you out of the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>If all of the SIlver rank instructor grouped together, the academy would probably be pressured to remove Lorist from his post.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe best solution as it is now is for you to try breaking through to the Silver rank. Once you\u2019re a Silver Swordsman, they won\u2019t be able to do anything to you. That\u2019s why I suggested you to go experience some life-and-death battles,\u201d said Charade earnestly.</p><br/><p>Letting out a bitter laugh, Lorist shook his head. He couldn\u2019t bear to tell Charade, who was earnestly concerned about him, that he was training in the Aquametal Technique he got from his past life and that his Battle Force constantly leaked through his hexagram circulation path into his meridians. There was no way he could explain it to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too hard. Without my family\u2019s Battle Force manual, there\u2019s almost no way for me to break through without the following hexagram circulation path diagrams. You yourself said that the hexagram path of my Battle Force technique was like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen. Even if I were to engage in life-and-death battles, there\u2019s no guarantee that I would be able to break through within a short time frame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s only one other way for you to secure your position in the academy. Have you heard about our academy\u2019s Gold Instructor Badge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know about that. Didn\u2019t Instructor Claude have one himself? Instructor Welledor who\u2019s in charge of the knight training course, Instructor Wensen from the horse traning course and even Instructor Loboff from the herbalism department possess those too. Isn\u2019t that badge given to anyone whose Battle Force is at the Gold rank?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about that badge. There\u2019s another gold swordsmanship instructor badge in our academy. A hundred years ago, there was a One Star Silver rank student in our academy who had won 30 straight duels against Two Star Silver instructors and rose to fame instantly. The academy employed him as a swordsmanship instructor and even made him a gold instructor badge. However, the student joined the army and went to fight in the Battle of the Silver River and successfully killed three imperial knights who were all Gold ranked fighters during an assault on the town of Ried but subsequently died from his injuries after the fight. To commemorate his deeds, the academy preserved his gold instructor badge and decided that anyone who was able to gain 30 consecutive victories with opponents of a higher rank (even those 1 star above) would gain that instructor badge and receive the same treatment as normal Gold ranked instructors. But should one lose even once to anybody, one would lose the qualifications to wear that badge as well as one\u2019s position as a Gold ranked instructor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade continued explaining, \u201cNobody within a 100 years has been able to get 30 consecutive victories like that student and the medal currently lies forgotten in the academy\u2019s hall of honor. Why don\u2019t you try obtaining that medal to avoid getting kicked out from the academy? I bet that it won\u2019t be too hard for you to win 30 duels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really was such a thing?\u201d Lorist rubbed his hands and continued, \u201cI\u2019m definitely getting this gold badge. Fatty, what was that student called?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name was Raven Incador. Had he survived the battle with the Gold rank experts of the Krissen Empire, he could have become a Blademaster. It\u2019s a shame he died so young. The special gold badge is called the Incador Medal,\u201d said Charade while lamenting the loss of such a talented man.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, fatty, let\u2019s figure out what I should do next. You mentioned there was a group of Silver ranked instructors plotting against me? Give me the names of all of them. I\u2019ll challenge them one by one,\u201d said Lorist as he licked his lips deviously, like a predator deciding on which part of its prey to enjoy first.</p><br/><p>The following ten days in the academy was rife with excitement.</p><br/><p>Lorist sent out letters of challenge to the instructors listed by Charade but none of them really cared much about it and even thought that it was a joke. Some of the instructors even tossed the letters into the trashcan, laughing and exclaiming, \u201cYou think he\u2019s qualified enough to challenge us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Given their arrogant attitudes, Lorist no longer held back either. He barged into the class of several instructors and challenged them in front of their students. Feeling rage and humiliation, the instructors pulled out their swords and wanted to teach the impudent and disrespectful Lorist a lesson he would never forget. In quick succession, one by one the instructors were beaten and sent to the academy medical center.</p><br/><p>The students of the academy were ecstatic. It wasn\u2019t every day when one got to see a proud, aloof instructor get beaten up by an Iron ranked instructor. As Lorist marched towards his next target, a crowd of students followed behind him and even told him the other instructors\u2019 locations.</p><br/><p>\u201cInstructor Locke, Instructor XX\u2019s over there. Are you gonna challenge him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInstructor XX and instructor XX are over there, hold them back! Instructor Locke is coming over for them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOver here, quick, Instructor Locke..\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stopped by ten or so Silver rank instructors from advancing and the other instructors insisted that the academy management come in to handle the situation and take care of Lorist, who has disrupted their courses and sent seven of their colleagues to the medical center.</p><br/><p>Some Silver ranked instructors hated Lorist to the bone and even shouted for him to leave the academy and that he was not fit to be an instructor there.</p><br/><p>Following that, several Gold ranked instructors including Instructor Claude came over and investigated the issue.</p><br/><p>Lorist told them this, \u201cI want the Incador Medal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was bewildered and didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><br/><p>Charade, who was maintaining the order of the student crowd, explained it to the other instructors.</p><br/><p>Following that, the gold ranked instructors finally understood that it was an academy tradition and even they could not do anything about it. They could only report it to the higher ups and await their decision.</p><br/><p>Lorist was unfazed and believed that this commotion wasn\u2019t his fault. To begin with, he only did this because the instructors who ignored his letters of challenge and didn\u2019t treat it seriously.</p><br/><p>Those who understood the situation looked pitily at the Silver ranked instructors, who started to feel pressured and anxious.</p><br/><p>Without much delay, Academy Head Levins announced his decision. \u201cLorist, keep at it. It would be a shame to see the Incador Medal continue to gather dust. I\u2019m rooting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>But he also mentioned that Lorist was not to disrupt the classes of other instructors and carry out the duels after work hours.</p><br/><p>The Silver ranked instructors were stunned and made excuses to take some time off from work to avoid the calamity that was to come. Several others went to other academies and applied for jobs there. The remaining ones grudgingly agreed to duel Lorist under the witness of Instructor Claude and the other Gold ranked instructors and the jeering students. One by one, they lost to him and were finally let off.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

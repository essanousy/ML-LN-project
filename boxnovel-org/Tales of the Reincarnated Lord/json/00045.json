Is it a toy for Alisa and Howard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Reidy shook his head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a toy. It\u2019s something I used before for my training. It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t let the kids play with it though. They simply just don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA training equipment? I don\u2019t seem to understand how it works,\u201d said Patt as he gave it another look and tried to imagine how it could be used for training.</p><br/><p>\u201cI used to play around in the mountains and forests a lot when I was small. And there was this one time when I accidentally knocked on a bees\u2019 nest and naturally, they started swarming around me. I was so scared and started swinging a branch around and managed to kill quite a few of them, but I got stung by many more and had sores all over my body and only managed to recover after a month. Because of that incident, I\u2019ve developed a phobia of sorts. Don\u2019t laugh, that\u2019s what master told me,\u201d said Reidy, dissatisfied at Patt\u2019s laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, sorry. My bad\u2026 Please continue your story,\u201d apologized Patt.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, I used to learn swordsmanship from my father. When I came over to Morante City, I also got some lessons from Uncle Charlando, who\u2019s the owner of the Red Grace Inn. Don\u2019t be fooled by that limp he has, he\u2019s actually a Gold Swordsman. When I\u2019m only practicing normal sword moves, I would perform without a problem. However, when I start sparring with someone, the moment I see the flash of a sword, I will unconsciously be reminded of the shiny tails of the bees that have given me so much grief and uncontrollably close my eyes and swing my sword around randomly. At that point, I\u2019ve already forgotten all the techniques I know. My father and uncle both came to the conclusion that I wasn\u2019t swordsman material\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you seem to have pretty good skills now, don\u2019t you? I didn\u2019t see any of that behavior when I sparred with you yesterday\u2026\u201d Patt couldn\u2019t imagine how the current Reidy still had any of those bad habits that he had just mentioned. During the sparring match yesterday, he was surprised and quite dissatisfied with the fact that a Three Star Iron rank like him was evenly matched with Reidy who was at the Three Star Bronze rank. And during the duel, it could be seen that instead of closing his eyes, Reidy had both of them wide open and seemed like he was paying attention to every single move Patt was making. That made Patt doubt the story Reidy had just told him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s no longer an issue for me. I\u2019ve been treated by master using that training machine. The big metal wheel is called a hollow rotor while that metal chair is called a spinning chair,\u201d explained Reidy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHollow rotor? Spinning chair? These two things managed to treat that bad habit of yours? Tell me how it managed to do that,\u201d asked Patt curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. When I first started to train with master, he discovered that bad habit of mine and asked me patiently about the reason that made me develop that habit. I told him about the incident with the bees and he said that it has caused a phobia to develop within my psyche which causes me to unconsciously close my eyes every time I felt like I was in danger. He said it was something called \u2018ostrich mentality. Don\u2019t ask me what an \u2018ostrich\u2019 is, I don\u2019t know that either. According to master, it\u2019s a kind of bird that lives in desert that hides its head into the sand every time it detects a predator and believes that as long as it can\u2019t see the enemy, it would be safe. Do you think there\u2019s actually a stupid bird like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what happened after that?\u201d asked Patt impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster said that it would take quite some time to treat the phobia through some kind of psychological treatment to slowly change that mentality of mine. But he also said that there was a quicker method that made one feel extremely horrible but could allow one to gain a unique visual ability that lets one see fast moving objects at a much slower rate. As long as I can see things moving slowly, I wouldn\u2019t feel that I was in danger and the instinct to close my eyes wouldn\u2019t kick in,\u201d explained Reidy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you chose the quicker way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I decided to do that right away. After that, master had someone make the hollow rotor and the spinning chair. All my life I\u2019ve never experienced something that dreadful. It took me almost two whole months to be able to get used to the sensation. After that, master said I was successfully treated and put some honey all over my body before releasing a couple of bees for me to strike down with my sword. At first, I was horrified at the notion. But when the bees came at me that time, I suddenly noticed that they approached very slowly. I could even see every flap of their wings clearly and managed to easily kill each and every one of them.\u201d Initially, Reidy showed a pained expression when he talked about the treatment process, but he started to sound more eager when he reached the part where he fought against the bees once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster said that the ability I developed was called dynamic vision which allowed me to perceive fast moving objects at a slowed rate when I focus. When I sparred against you yesterday, I could see each and every one of your sword strikes clearly and could parry every single one of them without breaking much of a sweat, thus allowing a Bronze rank like me to match up to a Three Star Iron rank like you. That\u2019s why our sparring match ended up in a draw,\u201d said Reidy with a satisfied expression.</p><br/><p>Patt looked at the hollow rotor and spinning chair and was instantly moved. \u201cThen Reidy, if I use that chair to train like you did, will I develop that dynamic vision ability as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Reidy was surprised before he said, \u201cYou should be able to. Master said that this equipment was built precisely for normal people to develop dynamic vision. If you want to try it out, I\u2019ll go ask master for permission. However, let me warn you that when you first start, you\u2019ll feel so horrible that you might even want to die. Are you sure that you don\u2019t want to reconsider?\u201d</p><br/><p>Patt shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind. As long as I can have the same ability as you do, I\u2019m sure that my skills will definitely rise and I will be able to better protect master. I think I\u2019ll go ask him myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need. I\u2019ll ask for you,\u201d said Reidy excitedly as he turned and ran towards the house entrance.</p><br/><p>Patt touched the equipment and thought, these two things look so simple. I wonder if it\u2019s really as horrible as Reidy had described? He couldn\u2019t just be trying to dissuade me from using it, could he?</p><br/><p>Without delay, Reidy came back and said happily, \u201cBrother Patt, master has already agreed to let you use it. But he said that you have to endure it no matter how terrible you feel and must absolutely not give up in the middle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patt said, \u201cThen I promise that I\u2019ll never give up. No, I\u2019ll even swear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then would you like to start now? Master has said that as long as you train the way I did, you\u2019ll definitely be able to develop dynamic vision,\u201d said Reidy, who looked like he was about to enjoy a good show.</p><br/><p>Maybe it\u2019s just my imagination, thought Patt.</p><br/><p>At that time, the sound of a horse galloping could be heard approaching the yard. Kelly had returned from the Business Sector from a shopping trip using the carriage shuttle service of the residential area.</p><br/><p>Reidy and Patt went over to help her carry the luggage into the storeroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Kelly, what are we having for lunch today?\u201d Reidy asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make steak, fish soup, salad, fruit pudding as well as Alisa\u2019s favorite chicken drumsticks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. You should make one less portion of steak. Otherwise, it\u2019ll go to waste,\u201d said Reidy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is the young master not coming back for lunch?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>Reidy smiled and said, \u201cNope, it\u2019s not the young master. You\u2019ll know soon\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>The dark night has come and a veil of silence blanketed the land. Even the frequent croaking of the frogs around the Moon Lake were significantly quieter.</p><br/><p>Lorist got up and stood by the window of his room and looked straight at the night view of the Moon Lake. A chilly breeze lifted the curtains and let it dance under the illumination of the silver moon.</p><br/><p>The sandglass on a table nearby showed that it was around two in the morning. But Lorist had no desire whatsoever to sleep and after pondering for a bit, he decided to go take a walk by the Moon Lake to calm his feelings down.</p><br/><p>The 8th month has already passed and it was currently the 1st day of the 9th month. The academy semester break was officially here.</p><br/><p>Few days back, President Peterson sent a box containing 30 gold coin notes to Lorist and thanked once again the instructors as well as the assistant instructors because his son Dorsedaus has successfully managed to awaken his Battle Force along with the last batch of students.</p><br/><p>Academy Head Levins also issued the promised reward of 1000 gold Fordes to the instructor team. Coupled with President Peterson\u2019s gift, there was at least 4000 gold coins in total. As the head instructor, Lorist collected 300 gold coins. Hughes, Marlin and Anfya each had a bonus of 200. The 24 other instructors each got 100 gold coins while the assistant instructors got 50 each. The remaining gold coins were used for a celebration at the Red Grace Inn where everyone engaged in fervent merrymaking during which Lorist was forced to drink so much that he puked over three times.</p><br/><p>As for the aftermath of the duels, Lorist finally secured his title as the Silver Undefeated the moment he got his 3000th win. When the dueling event was finally over, the academy administration had Lorist\u2019s physical proportions measured for the life-sized statue they were going to commission for him. Starting from the next semester, his statue will be erected within the academy, forever immortalizing the legend of Iron Locke the Silver Undefeated.</p><br/><p>In a few more days, Els finally wrapped up his betting pool. By that time, Lorist will finally receive the 26000 gold Fordes he was entitled to, causing him to have a grand total of almost 30000 gold Fordes. In Morante City, a person with that kind of money could already be considered a tycoon who would be able to live in luxury for tens of years even if they stayed jobless.</p><br/><p>And when the next semester comes during the 10th month, there would be no tasks at the moment that the academy can hand to Lorist, meaning that he could use that time to enjoy his life at home or go adventuring with a couple of friends as he has done so in the past. Even though the semester break had finally come, for some reason, Lorist still felt as if a burden could be felt deep in his heart which caused him to be unable to relax to the point where he didn\u2019t have any appetite and started having sleepless nights.</p><br/><p>The silver moon\u2019s light made the lakewater seem to glisten. Lorist sat on a large rock by the bank and stared at the moon\u2019s reflection as he thought\u2026</p><br/><p>Indeed, he was merely trying to run away. If it were the past few days, he could still use the dueling event and the Battle Force awakening course as an excuse to postpone the decision to return to his homeland. But now that everything was settled, he had no choice but to face the facts squarely.</p><br/><p>Why should I return to inherit the dominion? That place is completely foreign to me and I don\u2019t know anybody there at all. Also, the family is also in deep trouble and accepting the title of the lord is equal to jumping into a pit of fire\u2026 Lorist really couldn\u2019t understand. He had lived at Morante City for the past ten years and formed connections with the people here and even got a stable job and was practically a living legend here. This was where he belonged.</p><br/><p>Very much satisfied with his life here, Lorist was really unwilling to go to the Northlands to inherit the position. As Shadekampf had said when he first arrived, the standard of living in Morante City was far better than that of the Norton dominion; Morante City was practically paradise. When it came to food and many other necessities, Lorist\u2019s homeland couldn\u2019t even compare as it really was far too underdeveloped.</p><br/><p>So, why, then did he feel a tinge of longing in his heart? It was as if a voice called out nonstop for him to leave Morante City to return to his dominion. Perhaps it was the blood and soul of the Nortons that was ingrained within him that prompted him to feel a deep desire to develop his dominion and strengthen his family. That was probably the deepest dormant instinct the descendants of the Norton family had.</p><br/><p>Even though Lorist really wanted to stay in Morante City and not return to his homeland, that wish conflicted with the imprinting of his soul thus making him feel unsettled and bothered till symptoms of insomnia and lack of appetite even manifested. If he continued to go on like that, who knew how bad it would become should he choose to endure the torturous inconsistency within his mind? Maybe if I continue to endure it until the 3rd month next year, the feeling will disappear when the family picks the previous lord\u2019s illegitimate child as the heir, Lorist thought.</p><br/><p>So what if that person isn\u2019t from a proper line of descent? Doesn\u2019t he also have the Norton Family\u2019s blood in him? The moment Lorist had that notion, a sudden intense wave could be felt within the core of his being, sending chills down his spine.</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo!\u201d sneezed Lorist.</p><br/><p>Alright, fine\u2026 Illegitimate children still have a fundamentally different status from the bloodline of the official line of descent that flows within my veins\u2026 Oh little Locke\u2026 It truly feels like we are two people sharing one body\u2026 Now that my mind is living in your body, it wouldn\u2019t be comfortable for any of us if you continue to struggle like this\u2026 Come on, I beg you\u2026 stop making me feel so bad\u2026 After his sincere pleading, the wave in his body finally calmed down. But a barely audible voice of someone crying could still be heard in his mind. \u201cI want to go home\u2026 I want to go home\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. I want to go home too. Little Locke, your homeland is still within reach but there\u2019s no way for me to return to mine\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lorist silently teared up as he sat alone on the rock by the lake. As the first rays of dawn broke the veil of the night sky, a trail of dried tears could be seen on his face. Lorist stood up and faced the rising sun before saying, \u201cLittle Locke, let\u2019s go back home together.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

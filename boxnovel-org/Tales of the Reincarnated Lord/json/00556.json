Initially, most of the Norton higher ups believed they would continue the fight to the bitter end and would attack Peterson. That was why the Lorist\u2019s forces prepared by sending Firmrock over to the defense line in Quadro.</p><br/><p>Lorist and Malek had planned to use two years to slowly grind away at the strength and stamina of the Trade Union instead of going all out and defeating them in one blow. They would creep in step by step until their enemy could not resist any longer. From a militaristic view, it was the method that gave them the least casualties, Additionally, in another half a year, the Peterson\u2019s royal army would take control of their own defenses. Only after they and the Union could face each other would Lorist sit on the sidelines.</p><br/><p>As for the Trade Union\u2019s salt problem, Lorist arranged with the duke to have a few people set up smuggling operations. They could keep the Trade Union teetering on the edge, whilst at the same time bleeding them dry. They would sell them rock salt at an exorbitant price and use the profit to fund their defenses. In essence, they were using the Union\u2019s money to train soldiers against them. The duke was more than happy to agree.</p><br/><p>But now, the Union had asked for peace.</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t you come earlier? You kept refusing when I was willing to negotiate, but now you want peace? Your doom is already rolling down the mountain towards you. Why do you have to go an make my plans a waste?</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we refuse?\u201d Lorist asked Charade.</p><br/><p>Knowing what was on his lord\u2019s mind, he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Union turned us down in the past because they thought we were being unreasonable and they still had breathing room. Now they have no choice, it\u2019s either death or surrender. They may be suing for peace, but this is surrender by another name. We will be calling the shots since we have all the power. We can make whatever demands we want. If they don\u2019t agree, we\u2019ll just wipe them out. If we just chase them away, we\u2019ll look like the bad guys and like our previous sweet words were lies.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the same time, we don\u2019t have the authority to turn them down. Your royal mandate it to end the war and negotiate peace, so you don\u2019t have the right to turn down overtures towards peace, only the king can do that. We should negotiate a deal that makes all our allies happy, then send it along to the king to give his final considerations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist nodded. Charade\u2019s words were true. The Union\u2019s surrender meant they were giving up on making up for their losses. Acknowledging the four restored nations and Peterson and the Free Union\u2019s sovereignty were the fundamental concessions. As for Chikdor and Mayflower\u2019s territories, the Union had no choice but to give up on them because they could not contend with them in their current state.</p><br/><p>All Lorist\u2019s goals had indeed been met. He\u2019d even got control of most of the continent\u2019s market. Given that the Union was willing to surrender, Lorist didn\u2019t have to play bad cop and could leave everything in Auguslo\u2019s hands. Given the king\u2019s nature, he would definitely not let the Union off easily, especially after how they had wronged him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it your way. Tell our king to come here and handle the negotiations--\u201c Lorist suddenly thought of something. \u201c--And, did the ambassador make any demands?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly one. They demand unfettered access to the markets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, so they\u2019re not willing to give up yet. They want to move the war from the battlefield to the market square,\u201d Lorist smiled, \u201cThe merchants are finally seeing the light. They know war is a matter for nobles. It\u2019s still not too late. Looks like they still have some confidence, for them to be willing to return to mercantilism.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we refuse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist rapped the desk with his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. The right to trade freely is no big deal. The alliance nobles also have all sorts of trading guilds selling their stuffs. The Union is just asking for the same rights. Agree to see them as equals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Your Grace.\u201d Charade stood up and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on, Can you talk to Duke Peterson privately about the policy of his salt sale? Make sure he doesn\u2019t allow anyone else to cross his borders. All salt sales to the Union must go through him. Since the Union lacks salt, if we have this exclusive arrangement, they can\u2019t buy salt from anyone aside from Peterson. Tell the duke that, even though this agreement won\u2019t be as profitable as smuggling, it would still net him a good profit. He will pay back the loan much faster. Also, tell the alliance forces stationed in Tenelik and Sylugnika to keep anyone from smuggling salt into the Union. As for the profit sharing, help mediate between them and Peterson and make sure things stay harmonious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade admirated his lord the more he listened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Grace\u2019s suggestion is splendid! The Union will never climb back from this. No matter what they do, they\u2019ll always be strangled by this noose. In the long term, their hate for the Peterson will fester...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, the more hateful they become, the more assured I am. Even if they recover, they\u2019ll have to go through the Peterson first. Otherwise, they\u2019ll have to stay cooped up in their four provinces for good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist raised his teacup and emptied it in one gulp.</p><br/><p>Tarkel knocked and came in.</p><br/><p>\u201cA message from the capital. The new queen delivered a healthy young prince. His Majesty has named him Helleist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha, looks like our king is quite industrious. Charade, prepare a congratulatory gift. Also, tell the king about the Union\u2019s suit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Your Grace. I\u2019ll start immediately.</p><br/><p>......</p><br/><p>The Trade Union\u2019s ambassador spoke with various representatives over the course of a month and finally took the first step to peace. The Union was incredibly humiliated. They had to recognize all the new nations, the kingdom of Chikdor, the duchies of Mokby, Cabasy, Samarita, and Zidkor, and the Free Union. As part of that recognition they had to forfeit all claims on the land the Free Union controlled. They were also saddled with 500 thousand gold Fordes in reparation payments.</p><br/><p>The ambassador also met with Mireitas, who was now a duke under King Peterson, and they signed a non-aggression pact. They recognized each other\u2019s territory and sovereignty.</p><br/><p>Laughably, the two sides seemed to have forgotten that a third of the Union\u2019s territory in Quadro was still controlled by House Norton. In their pact, they would respect each other\u2019s rights and Mireitas welcomed Trade Union trade.</p><br/><p>Charade, who presode over the negotiations, smiled secretly. I wonder how the Union will react after they learn that the Petersons have rallied the other four nations to an exclusive salt trade policy. Maybe they\u2019ll tear the pact up and declare war again?</p><br/><p>The pact allowed only Peterson salt to be traded within or transported through any of the kingdoms\u2019 territories. Since they all but surrounded the Union, that meant that the Union could only buy Peterson salt. Even if they bought salt elsewhere, they could not get it back home.</p><br/><p>The negotiations between the two Unions were far simpler. The Free Union did not put any airs. They immediately accepted the Trade Union\u2019s offer of a million gold Fordes in reparations. They were also quick to agree on free trade and mutual recognition. Naturally, a large part of that was due to the \u2018private visit\u2019 the Trade Union ambassador paid to the Free Union negotiators.</p><br/><p>The Trade Union\u2019s only worry was that House Norton had yet to begin peace negotiations. The fat old fox Charade had publicly announced their peaceful intents for the war but now they were stalling for time.</p><br/><p>The ambassador finally understood why when news arrived that King Auguslo was on his way south. He travelled with just a regiment of personal guards and started talks almost as he stepped through Morante\u2019s gates.</p><br/><p>The king had two demands. The Trade Union\u2019s premier had to issue a public apology for their sins and the man had to boy before the king in apology to him personally. The second was a payment of ten million gold Fordes in war reparations.</p><br/><p>The ambassador almost quit right there. The king had done nothing but almost lose the war. House Norton had won the war, but now he was making all the demands, and they were all focus on his personal prestige. He kept his cool, however, and sent the demands on to Duke Cobleit.</p><br/><p>To his surprise, Duke Cobleit arrived a few weeks later and personally apologized to Auguslo. Auguslo settled on five million in reparations as a sign of good will after the duke\u2019s show of sincerity. Two million would be an immediate deposit and the rest could be paid over the next five years.</p><br/><p>Peace was finally restored.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

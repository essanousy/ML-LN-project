Lorist\u2019s lands were flooded with cheer. In fact, the weather had been nice since Lorist took over 20 years earlier. Despite the stormy ocean weather in the north, the coast had not been hit by a severe storm in over two decades, nor had there been any floods.</p><br/><p>Spiel was not surprised when Lorist brought it up during one of their meetings, however. According to him, the Northlands was known for its calm weather; disasters were rare. The only reason it hadn\u2019t been properly developed before Lorist came along was the chronic shortage of people. Few people were willing to brave the magic beasts that used to roam the region annually. With them gone, however, there was little to stop people from coming north.</p><br/><p>The biggest problem the north used to face beside the magic beasts was the chronic belligerence of the region\u2019s nobles. What little growth in population there was thanks to childbirth was quickly squandered in petty squabbles. There was also the issue of occasional barbarian raids from the mountains. The Nortons were especially plagued by them and spent most of the little wealth they saved up in campaigns against the hordes.</p><br/><p>Things were different now, however. The beast waves were no more, the old squabbling nobles were gone and the new ones were all loyal to Lorist, and the barbarians had not come down from the mountains to raid in over a decade. The people were now free to unearth the region\u2019s riches. It was certainly a great help that the region finally had decent infrastructure. The region\u2019s population had seen a historic explosion and there was little sign that, even now that Lorist was no longer shipping tens of thousands of captured peasants north, the population would not continue to grow substantially for the foreseeable future.</p><br/><p>The region was not just in a good present condition, but all forecasts predicted it would rise to rival even the most prosperous regions elsewhere in the empire. Lorist\u2019s rule would no doubt go down in history as the greatest rule of any noble in the empire\u2019s history, maybe even of any noble on the continent. There was little doubt in Spiel\u2019s mind that Lorist would be remembered as Norton the Great, or something similar. He kept saying Lorist should take a few years off and spend some quality time with his family. His greatest duty now was to ensure that his successor would be educated enough and correctly such that he would not squander the glory his predecessor had built.</p><br/><p>Lorist agreed. His life in the north to date had been a tale of continuous war and crisis. It was time to step away from the path of bloodshed and focus on letting his lands thrive.</p><br/><p>Life, unfortunately, was not accommodating of man\u2019s wishes. He had developed his dominion rapidly, but had done so without sufficiently overhauling its fundamental governing system. He was still ruling it like he was a baron only responsible for a single town, someone who could afford to be in direct control of everything. But his lands were now greater than most kingdoms. Despite that, he still had to keep watch over almost everything that happened. His desk was permanently buried under reports and documents that required his attention.</p><br/><p>Viscount Josk, for one, had come to see him not long ago. He came to ask permission to take Jaeger to the wildlands to do training and run a few wargames.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a fever? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Lorist had asked, putting his palm to the man\u2019s forehead, \u201cIt\u2019s mating season right now. We don\u2019t go into the wildlands until the 10th month when the catch will be the best. You\u2019re six months early!\u201d</p><br/><p>Freiyar had definitely opposed Josk as well, as was Malek, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have come to Lorist. Lorist was most puzzled that Josk would want to do anything with Jaeger at all, he rare got involved with the legion at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Joe? You should be in your viscounty right now. You have to find yourself a woman and get to work on an heir, not running off to the wildlands to hunt. I understand you are very loyal to your late fianc\u00e9e, but you have a responsibility to yourself and your subjects to secure your bloodline. Besides, would your late fianc\u00e9e want you to live alone like this for the rest of your life? Wouldn\u2019t she want you to have a family and experience the joy of being a father?\u201d Lorist asked.</p><br/><p>Josk didn\u2019t meet Lorist\u2019s gaze. He kept his head low and only muttered about wanted to do more for him. He had been forced to cancel the previous year\u2019s hunt because of the new year\u2019s celebration and wanted to make up for it. Many other nobles had begun forming winter armies as well and the price of fur had doubled. A missed hunt was hundreds of thousands of gold Fordes down the drain, at least.</p><br/><p>Lorist smiled bitterly. The house\u2019s finances were fine. They didn\u2019t need to hunt every year just to stay solvent. A missed hunt wasn\u2019t a big deal. Cutting supply to the market for a season or so might actually be a good thing since it would chase the price up.</p><br/><p>Josk left with an odd expression as if he had trouble he couldn\u2019t articulate but he didn\u2019t say anything. Lorist grew suspicious and had Viscount Kriston investigate the matter.</p><br/><p>Potterfang came two days later with a grim air about him. This time it was about his daughter\u2019s marriage. His little elf-like brat of a girl, Alisa, had quickly grown into a beautiful young lady. He temperament, however, broke Potterfang\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Lorist\u2019s impression of her was still that of the coquettish girl that mocked him whenever she saw him. It wasn\u2019t his fault though. He had rarely, if ever, played with her again after the convoy arrived in the northlands. If his memory served, Telesti had taken her as a disciple a few years earlier, hoping to raise her into a proper lady.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on, she\u2019s 28 already? And she\u2019s the knight-commander the Order of the Cherry Blossom?\u201d Lorist choked.</p><br/><p>The Order of the Cherry Blossom occupied a very awkward position in the military. They were a small knightly order nominally in the military, but they weren\u2019t subject to its chain of command. Sylvia was given command of the then \u2018woman brigade\u2019 when she married Lorist and turned it into a knightly order. Since she was the order\u2019s captain, no one from the military brass had the authority to give any of the order\u2019s members commands, not to mention that, as a knightly order, they were technically completely autonomous of any faction. The only reason Lorist could give them orders was because Sylvia was his wife and would listen to him, so technically he suggested something to Sylvia and she was the one that actually gave the order. The order was only peripherally trained in combat, however, since they were mostly a ceremonial force concerned with guarding Sylvia, though they were trained and deployed as healers from time to time.</p><br/><p>Lorist had wanted to give them a more active role as combat medics, but they weren\u2019t interested. Before they were turned into an order, when they were still known as just the woman brigade, they had been deployed against Iblia during the campaign against the second prince\u2019s climax. Norton\u2019s side had suffered few losses, but the woman from the brigade couldn\u2019t handle the blood and gore. Many were struck with night sweats, angst, and incessant nightmares thereafter. The unit nearly disbanded after the battle, in fact.</p><br/><p>The brigade was put under Tigersoar, but most of the women quickly paired up with men from the legion and retired after getting pregnant.</p><br/><p>With the unit reduced to a mere husk, Lorist had to retrain the unit from the ground up. He took it out of Tigersoar and turned it into a reserve force that dealt mostly in paperwork and handled medical stations and hospitals behind the front lines. They did quite well in that role. They frequently put on shows for the recovering soldiers which boosted morale.</p><br/><p>Sylvia found out about the brigade shortly before the marriage and asked to be given command of it as Lorist\u2019s wedding gift, which Lorist was happy to do. She quickly went about turning the brigade into a proper knightly order with her as its captain. She didn\u2019t get involved in most of its inner workings after it was set up, however, instead that duty fell to the unit\u2019s technical second in command, but practical leader, the order\u2019s knight-commander. The order operated out of Sylvia\u2019s personal residence, Cherry Blossom Ridge, and she named the order after the place since she loved it so much. Thus Pesha\u2019s pet project from two decades earlier had become the Duchess of the Northlands\u2019 personal knightly order, a force none but the Duke and the Duchess could command.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe decided to become a knight after seeing Pesha when she was young? I didn\u2019t think that woman had any fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace. Alisa went to Dawn Academy to study and awake her battleforce when she turned 16. She spent several years there in the knighthood course. She went to Nico Academy and became Lady Telesti\u2019s first knight. Her ambition get the better of her after a few years though. She grew restless and eventually joined the woman brigade. She advanced to two-star silver rank two years ago and became the order\u2019s new knight-commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>Potterfang appeared frustrated. He had wanted to keep this under wraps at first, but his relationship with his daughter had always been tense. Had took the daughter of one of the house\u2019s captured nobles as his wife, against the wishes of his children, Howard and Alisa. The two felt he had betrayed their deceased mother and Alisa stopped listening to her father. Potterfang couldn\u2019t exactly barge in and take his daughter out of Nico Academy and away from Telesti as her knight since she was Lorist\u2019s lover, though it had been years since the two had interacted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see... So Alisa is both Telesti\u2019s knight and knight-commander of the sylvia\u2019s cherry blossoms. No wonder I haven\u2019t heard anything about her for so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alisa would have been mentioned in at least one report if she\u2019d pledged herself to House Norton. Lorist\u2019s memory was quite good and he would have known it was her immediately. She had joined the Order of the Cherry Blossom, which was nominally part of House Norton, but knightly orders were a difficult thing. Even if their heads were members of a noble household, orders were never part of any political faction. They were independent military forces that operated according to their founding ideals, so even though Alisa was a part of Sylvia\u2019s order, she was not technically a member of House Norton.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want me to convince her to get married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this, Your Grace. Howard is Your Grace\u2019s disciple and is married. I don\u2019t mind whether he remains your servant or found his own house. I trust my son, and with you there to guide him, I have nothing to worry about. But Alisa is 28, and she hasn\u2019t married or had any children yet. She\u2019s already very old to still be unmarried and I worry she\u2019ll grow into an old, lonely woman if this goes on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m her father, so I should be the one to arrange a good husband for her, but she won\u2019t listen to me. She has her own ideas about marriage and she\u2019s been stirring up a big commotion in that regard lately. I shouldn\u2019t be talking about her behind her back, but I worry as her father. Please, Your Grace, will you not help this old father and deal with this before it becomes a scandal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Potterfang left Lorist with many questions unanswered after only vaguely explaining the situation. Lorist was not about to get involved in something that could be hot water without knowing what was going on first, so he had Kriston look into it first.</p><br/><p>When he got the report, he nearly jumped through his study\u2019s roof.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

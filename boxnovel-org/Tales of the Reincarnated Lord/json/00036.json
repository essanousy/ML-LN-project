Instructor Marlin, having drunk a little too much, was telling Charade all about the plan for him to make tons of gold coins. The fatty\u2019s eyes instantly gleamed as he gave Marlin another jug of ale to shut him up, after which he dragged Yuriy and Terman to a corner and started whispering away.</p><br/><p>Just as Lorist pushed open the door and greeted Charlando, who was manning the counter, he sat beside Instructor Marlin. Having spent the afternoon with President Peterson in the sauna, he felt a little worn out and decided to take a nap in his room, only to wake up when the sky was already dark and rushed over right away.</p><br/><p>Instructor Marlin looked at Lorist with his drunken eyes and said, \u201cBrother Locke\u2026 Yo-you\u2019re late\u2026 Here, have a cup of booze\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Marlin, how much did you drink? You\u2019re totally wasted!\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s over\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely be nagged at by his wife when I send him back\u2026 Lorist tried to dismiss that thought and called the serving girl Molly over to take his order as he had yet to have dinner. As she took his order, Molly also complained to Lorist about how he hasn\u2019t been coming over to the inn to spend the night with her and asked if he would want to do just that tonight.</p><br/><p>Lorist was definitely moved after seeing Molly\u2019s splendid figure. It has been almost a month since he last had any nighttime action as he really has been too busy in the recent days. He wouldn\u2019t have come over to the inn either if it wasn\u2019t payday. He also recalled that Charlando and Louise would be getting married within a month and he still hasn\u2019t prepared a gift for them yet.</p><br/><p>However, looking at how wasted Instructor Marlin was, Lorist turned down Molly\u2019s offer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Molly. I\u2019ve really been too busy recently. I have to send this guy over here back to his home later so I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay the night. Maybe in another few days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Molly humphed with a tone of dissatisfaction. \u201cJust you wait,\u201d said Molly coldly, before she turned and left.</p><br/><p>Even so, Molly didn\u2019t forget her place as a serving girl and quickly sent the food Lorist had ordered to him. After getting a few bites, Charade sat in front of Lorist and swiped a piece of roast goose from his plate and started chewing away.</p><br/><p>\u201cSol, did you wash your hands? Don\u2019t dirty my food like that,\u201d scolded Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to finish it, let me help,\u201d said Yuriy as he came over. He was even worse and took the whole plate of roast goose away from Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet you guys are just here to make me pay for you again. I\u2019m telling you beforehand that all of you aside from Marlin will have to settle your own bills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no issue,\u201d said the fatty as he spit out the bones of the goose before waving at the serving girls and pointing at Instructor Marlin, who was lying flat on the table. \u201cBrother Marlin here still wants\u2026 one, two, three\u2026 six, six more cups of blackcurrant fruit wine and another two barrels of blackcurrant ale. Oh, and let chef McDuffin make him a few more delicious dishes to go with all the alcohol.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing his name mentioned, Instructor Marlin who was lying flat on the table raised his cup and said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s drink\u2026\u201d before falling flat onto the surface once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSol, I never knew that would work\u2026 It\u2019s your win, fatty\u2026\u201d said Lorist with his mouth agape with the half-chewed food nearly falling out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Having successfully taking advantage of Lorist once again, Charade, Yuriy and gang clapped their hands in celebration.</p><br/><p>In the midst of all the merrymaking, a person suddenly rushed over in front of Lorist and kneeled down. Very much stunned at this sight, Lorist asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>That person said loudly, \u201cI want to be your disciple! Please let me learn the way of the sword from you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Charade and gang were totally flabbergasted. What was this situation about?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving seen all your battles within the past month, I really want to learn swordsmanship from you. Before, it was totally my fault for saying that you didn\u2019t qualify to teach me for just being an Iron rank. I am deeply sorry for that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Locke, that is the kid I was talking about. He\u2019s regretting his decision terribly right now,\u201d said Els, who suddenly appeared beside Lorist and swiped a bottle of fruit wine from one of the serving girls\u2019 trays. \u201cGet us another bottle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not paying for that, alright?\u201d clarified Lorist. It was troublesome enough for Charade to have managed to order six more bottles of fruit wine which cost one large silver each under the name of Marlin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just joking. Put the bill on his tab,\u201d said Els to the serving girl before patting Lorist on the shoulder as he pointed at the kneeling youth. \u201cSit down, old friend. Let\u2019s first talk about whether you will accept him as your student.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigh, I really can\u2019t do anything about the bills, Lorist thought, before turning his attention to the youth on the ground. Hmmm, Els was right about him having a rather nice physique. He\u2019s only 16 and yet he looks so well-built and tall. I would have thought that he was 20 if I wasn\u2019t told of his age beforehand\u2026 Blonde hair, straight nose and clear eyes, he actually looks pretty decent. At this moment, the youth on the ground had a perplexed expression as he clenched his lips and awaited Lorist\u2019s decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d asked Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m called Reidy Gezeizidorf,\u201d said the youth nervously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, then I\u2019ll call you Reidy. Reidy, having watched my battles, then you should know that I\u2019m both a swordsmanship and Battle Force instructor at the Dawn Academy. As long as you enroll over there, I\u2019ll naturally be able to teach you swordsmanship without you having to kneel here like that. Also, I\u2019m only eight years older than you, you know. I don\u2019t plan on accepting a personal disciple just yet. I think it\u2019s better if you and attend an elementary academy before applying to the Dawn Academy the next year,\u201d said Lorist.</p><br/><p>Reidy was disappointed at the response, but he remained kneeling. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to attend school. All the people there laugh at me for being a country bumpkin and look down on me. I only want to learn swordsmanship from you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Having had vast economical development over the last twenty years of peace, Morante City has become one of the most advanced merchant cities on the Grindia Continent. Gradually, its citizens began to develop arrogance and pride for being born in the city. Just like how people in Lorist\u2019s past life would look down on foreign laborers, many citizens of Morante City would berate outsiders for being country bumpkins and assume that all of them fit under the stereotype of thieves and robbers. It could be seen that the attitude of the trade union\u2019s people has become intolerant and materialistic.</p><br/><p>This kind of discrimination wasn\u2019t too uncommon at the Dawn Academy either and it was usually the main cause for disputes between local and non-local students in the academy. Lorist was surprised at how Reidy has already experienced such a thing at an elementary academy. It\u2019s no wonder Els said he had beaten up all the students in the whole class in one of the academies he had attended before.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Locke, just take him it. He\u2019s just that stubborn and wouldn\u2019t get up if you don\u2019t accept him as a disciple. Well, it\u2019s not like you have to actually teach him. Just treat him as your personal attendant and give him pointers from time to time. Since you\u2019re still a person with a noble status, nobody would say anything if you had a retainer or two following you around,\u201d encouraged Els as he sipped the wine from the bottle in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Lorist sometimes actually forgot that he came from a noble family. Even though he had been exiled from the family, he still bore the family name and had the right to use the Norton family insignia as proof of his noble status. If he were to mingle in high society, he would receive the treatment and service of a nobleman. It\u2019s just that Lorist had never paid much attention to matters such as these.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Els sounded like he just remembered something. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just move into a new place? I\u2019ve been thinking quite hard about what to give you as a housewarming gift. It so happens that a guy who owed me money went bankrupt and is auctioning his possessions away to pay back the debt. Jindoz already went and collected his horses and carriage as collateral. Since you don\u2019t have a carriage yourself, I thought that I\u2019d give that to you since I won\u2019t be using it anyway. That\u2019s why I think you should accept Reidy as he can help you take care of the carriage and the Zeno Horses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist gave a bitter laugh. Since Els is going out of his way just to make him take Reidy in, he said to the youth kneeling in front of him, \u201cReidy, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard what Els had just said. Would you be willing to be my attendant for now? If not, you had better get up as I won\u2019t be taking in a disciple in the near future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reidy instantly got up and said, \u201cOf course I\u2019m willing. I\u2019ll make sure the horses and carriage receive the best of my care! I\u2019ll be bringing my stuff over now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Reidy run off to pack his belongings, Els nodded and said, \u201cThis fellow will make a good attendant given his hardworking attitude and abundant energy. He\u2019s also a pretty good coachman as well. I\u2019ll be leaving him in your care, Brother Locke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade looked at them with an expression of envy. \u201cEls, why did you gift Lorist a horse carriage but nothing to me? I was even your classmate at that time! Was our relationship that shallow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Brother Locke has given me a couple of great ideas for businesses that\u2019s worth thousands of gold coins. Jindoz said that if I didn\u2019t give him anything, I would lose all my face. As for you, what have you done for me other than taking advantage of me? You still dare to demand gifts? Dream on,\u201d said Els.</p><br/><p>Still not convinced, Charade said, \u201cI refuse to believe that Locke can come up with any ideas for a business that\u2019s worth that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Els told the whole thing about repackaging and selling the Terrence-donkey whip to the group since it wasn\u2019t that much of a secret to begin with and managed to convince Charade.</p><br/><p>Yuriy nodded and said, \u201cThis business really is quite profitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Els had heard about the idea from Lorist, he had someone sent to purchase all the Terrence-donkey whips available from the Relic Islands right away. The shipment will be arriving in another month and the medicinal wine and glass bottles were all prepared. Without the power and connections Els\u2019s syndicate has, no normal businessman would be able to prepare all that within a short period of time.</p><br/><p>Charade said bitterly, \u201cThis bastard really has a brain that\u2019s much more wtty than most\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Lorist about to finish his meal, Els placed the wine bottle back on the table and said, \u201cCome, Brother Locke. Let\u2019s go check the carriage out. I\u2019ve parked it in the back alley.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group then went as a group to go see the horse cart. Its design wasn\u2019t like that of the normal coaches that one could rent on the streets. It was a four-wheeled cart that boasted a complete dark brown-colored carriage which was suited for long distance travel with four green glass windows that helped the interior of the carriage to gain some illumination during the day. The roof and back of the carriage was fitted with bronze racks on which luggage could be placed. At the front of it was a seat that could fit two coachmen.</p><br/><p>Els kicked on the cartwheel for a bit before he gleefully said, \u201cThis wheel, axle and bearing were all made in the dwarven kingdom from fairy steel and are incomparably tough and long-lasting. The metal bracket that\u2019s securing the carriage is also fitted with a large shock absorber that will minimize the shakiness of the ride. With this carriage, you will no longer have to worry about transportation or shelter when you go on mercenary missions in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSol, who would use this kind of carriage to mercenary missions? Only nobles use carriages like this,\u201d Charade interjected.</p><br/><p>Ignoring Charade\u2019s comment, Els said to Lorist, \u201cCome, let\u2019s check the interior out too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The carriage itself was fitted with two grey leather seats on the front and the back which faced each other. The back seat can also be folded downwards into a makeshift bed. Below the seats were four small drawers that could be used to store small items. The walls of the carriage were fitted with a light purple velvet cloth with two lamps on either side to help light up the interior at night.</p><br/><p>Els knocked on the walls and said,\u201d There\u2019s a thin steel plate within these walls and over here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Els pointed towards the roof and continued, \u201cAbove are six pieces of light metal plates that are fastened by a velvet string that can be released to cover the parts where there are windows and provide some temporary defense towards any potential threat from the outside. There is also a trapdoor which is hidden under the carpet. You can use it for an emergency escape if the situation is dire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Terman was full of praise for the carriage. \u201cThe designer of the carriage has clearly considered most of the scenarios that one would encounter during long distance travel and has outfitted it adequately with certain necessary precautions. It must have been a pretty expensive one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade looked at it full of envy. \u201cIt should cost no less than 100 gold coins. Including the price of those two Zeno Horses, I believe the actual price is even higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeno Horses were the most famous kind of mount on the Grindia Continent which were quite well known for their endurance, making them suited for long distance traveling even though their maximum speed was slightly slower than other kinds of horses.</p><br/><p>Yuriy asked sheepishly, \u201cEls, how much did you say that bankrupt merchant owe you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Els scratched his head in thought and said, \u201cShould be about 30 gold coins, if not 40.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Everybody was speechless.</p><br/><p>Lorist didn\u2019t really mind whether the horses and carriage were taken by force since that was what the syndicates usually did anyway given their forceful management approach. Patting on the horse cart, he said satisfiedly, \u201cThanks, Els. I\u2019ll take care of it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Reidy carrying a rucksack on his back as he came over, Lorist called out to him and said, \u201cReidy, put the stuff into the carriage and prepare the horses. Fatty, come with me to get Instructor Marlin. I need to send him back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade asked, \u201cWill you be coming back to drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist shook his head and said, \u201cNope, I won\u2019t be. I still have to duel tomorrow and it\u2019s getting rather late. Oh, and, are you leaving as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade said, \u201cNo, we\u2019ll be staying here for a bit more. The food still isn\u2019t served yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist just remembered something and said, \u201cOh, I better go settle the bills lest you put your orders under my tab.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSol, you\u2019re so stingy, Locke. Didn\u2019t Els just gift you a horse cart worth 100 gold coins? Surely you wouldn\u2019t mind treating us something to commemorate that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d replied Lorist.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You look very anxious. Has a fire broken out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, there\u2019s no fire, sir. Academy Head, are you going to just leave it be? Another three of our Silver ranked instructors have just resigned today,\u201d said Instructor Claude.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I know that,\u201d nodded Levins as he stood up. \u201cWould you like some tea or some macks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Macks was a beverage that was quite similar to a chocolate drink; the beans would let out a rich, fragrant aroma when ground and boiled with water. It was even rumored to be the favorite drink of ancient fairies as well as the legendary magi of the past and was quite highly priced.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine with some plain water. Right now the Silver ranked instructors are extremely afraid of being challenged to a duel by Lorist. If this keeps on going we\u2019ll be even more understaffed and will find it hard-pressed to maintain our usual classes. It\u2019s one thing if the students only spectate the duels, but they are also eager to see Lorist beat the crap out of all the Silver ranked instructors in the school. Every day a whole bunch of them would follow him around in anticipation of such a scene; it\u2019s quite pressuring and humiliating to the instructors Lorist challenges,\u201d explained Claude.</p><br/><p>Levins lifted a silver kettle on the table and poured some water for Claude and asked, \u201cHas Lorist lost a match yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s fighting his 28th duel today and hasn\u2019t even lost one match, and I don\u2019t think he will either. I\u2019ve seen a few of his matches and I believe those Silver ranked instructors wouldn\u2019t be able to put up a fight with Lorist at all. Most of them lose within ten sword bouts when dueling Instructor Locke,\u201d replied Claude.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no need to do anything. We can stop him after he gets the Incador Medal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Academy Head, 13 of the 28 instructors he challenged have already resigned due to the humiliation of losing to him in public. Even several of those who hasn\u2019t received any challenge from him left in fear as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t even have the courage to face failure, I wouldn\u2019t stop them from leaving. We don\u2019t need spineless cowards like those in the Dawn Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing bitterly, Claude continued, \u201cAcademy Head, say that as you may, but think about how we\u2019re supposed to maintain our regular classes with the sudden loss of more than 20 Silver ranked instructors. There are already three swordsmanship classes that can\u2019t continue anymore due to the sudden vacancy, with the students left with nothing to do but to wander around in the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slowly moving up to the window and gazing outwards, Levins said, \u201cClaude, don\u2019t you feel that our academy has been stagnating for some time now, much like a pool of still water?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d Instructor Claude tilted his head as he did not understand what the Academy Head just said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile our academy has only 13 Gold ranked instructors, the Silver ranked instructors number a staggering 129 people! Even the rest of the Iron ranked instructors and the assistant instructors only number 42 people, with another 31 people being non-combatant professors who focus on other disciplines. The academy management staff consists of 45 people, the Enforcement Department has 68 and the other miscellaneous workers number 76 people. Apart from them are roughly 5000 students. Given that kind of ratio, don\u2019t you think the Silver ranked instructors hold a little too much influence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Levins turned to Claude and said with a smile, \u201cWe have always put more focus on the actual abilities of a person when we intend to appoint someone as an instructor. Since when has it been based on their Battle Force? If it were like that, doesn\u2019t mean that a cripple like me who can\u2019t train in Battle Force should resign as the Academy Head as well? As Silver ranked instructors, not only do they not continue to strive for perfection, they harbored jealousy for people more skilled than them, banded together and formed their own hierarchies and even dared to put pressure on the academy when anything starts to go against their favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, the reason I let Locke do as he pleases was partly due to Charade\u2019s support as well. It is time that we wake up the Silver ranked instructors of the academy and remind them that their status in the academy is not dependant on their Battle Force ranks but rather their actual skills. If there\u2019s anyone who\u2019s unsatisfied with this policy, they\u2019re free to resign for all I care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wiping sweat off his forehead, Claude said, \u201cThen, what do we do about the suspended classes? Should we start recruiting new instructors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be no need. I already negotiated with the city\u2019s garrison general and will be having ten or so retired military officers who are all of the Gold rank to come over and be replacement instructors for a while. If we still lack people, we can appoint some promising students to be our new instructors, but only if they\u2019re truly capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDuly noted. I suppose I\u2019ll make my move now,\u201d said Instructor Claude as he put down the cup on the table and turned towards the exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait,\u201d said the Academy Head. \u201cThere\u2019s still two other things. First, when Locke gains his 30th consecutive victory, carry out a small ceremony to award him the Incador Medal. Second, put up a notice that states that instructors of the Dawn Academy cannot refuse challenges from other instructors or students. Those who do not comply should leave the academy. Hmph, if I don\u2019t force them like this, they won\u2019t continue to strive to improve their skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. It will be carried out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, and you mentioned three classes having no instructors in charge at the moment?\u201d Levins gave it some thought and continued, \u201cWhen Locke gets the Incador Medal, assign him to take charge of these three classes since they lost their instructors because of him in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, is that for real?\u201d thought Instructor Claude, speechless.</p><br/><p>In only three sword strokes, Lorist forced the instructor he challenged to admit defeat.</p><br/><p>This was his 30th duel. There was a small stage about the height of a person beside the dueling venue. It was like they knew without a doubt that Lorist would win. Instructor Claude stood solemnly by the stage beside a beautiful female student who held a box that was about 30 centimeters wide, presumably containing the Incador Medal within.</p><br/><p>Lorist was still in a rather good mood after his victory; he found the duels he initiated for the past ten days to be quite addictive. The feeling of owning the other Silver ranked instructors completely was quite pleasant. Maybe he could negotiate with Instructor Claude about whether he could continue dueling for another twenty or more times and create another record within the academy and rename the Incador Medal after him.</p><br/><p>Too bad Instructor Claude rejected the proposal immediately and pulled him up to the small stage. All the students cheered as Lorist received the Incador Medal.</p><br/><p>During the ceremony, Claude announced two things. He first congratulated Lorist for obtaining the Incador Medal and the history and explained the tradition behind the medal. After the long speech, he finally said something that is of direct relevance to Lorist, that is, Lorist was to be treated as a Gold ranked instructor in the academy and shall receive the same benefits and entitlements as a Gold ranked instructor.</p><br/><p>The second announcement came directly from the academy administration. From that day onwards, no instructor is to refuse a duel from students or other instructors for no justifiable reason and the result of every duel would play a part in the yearly instructor evaluations. Should an instructor refuse a duel for no reason up to three times or should they lose too many duels, the instructor will have to relinquish their instructor badge. The rules and protocol of dueling was also announced to the crowd, namely, an instructor may not challenge a student, a person of a higher rank may not challenge those of lower ranks, etc.</p><br/><p>But that special rule concerning challenges directed to lower ranks didn\u2019t apply to Lorist because he was the holder of the Incador Medal. Since he got it by getting consecutive victories against opponents of a higher level in the first place, he must still accept challenges issued by Silver ranked instructors even though his Battle Force was only at the Iron rank. Lorist will lose both the Incador Medal as well as the Gold rank instructor privileges should he lose even one duel.</p><br/><p>Unbeknownst to Lorist, he was serving as a pawn in the Academy Head\u2019s plan to change the academy\u2019s attitude and as a whip to pressure the Silver ranked instructors. He did, however, feel that the timing for the second announcement was a little too coincidental with his obtaining the Incador Medal.</p><br/><p>Initially thinking of bringing his winning streak above 50, Lorist came to understand after the second announcement that there will no doubt be flocks of students and Silver ranked instructors coming to challenge him to take the Incador Medal from him. On the bright side, he would not lack opponents to battle against. But it was pretty unfair for others to be able to take the Incador Medal from him after winning against him only once while he had to get 30 consecutive victories against opponents of a higher rank.</p><br/><p>Without giving Lorist too much time to figure out the implications, Instructor Claude went before Lorist and talked to him sincerely, \u201cI have good news and bad news for you, Instructor Locke. Which would you rather hear first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Analyzing Claude\u2019s behavior but not finding anything weird about it, Lorist said, \u201cLet me hear the good news first. At least it\u2019ll cheer me up a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe good news is during this month, there will be ten retired Gold ranked military officers coming to the academy to take on posts as Gold ranked instructors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? I can understand that it is good news for the academy, but what does it have to do with me?\u201d asked Lorist curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause, the bad news is you have to take charge of the three classes that have lost their instructors because of you. You are to handle their swordsmanship classes until the end of this month before the new Gold ranked instructors come. This came from the administration so there is no ground for negotiations. Consider this a light punishment for stirring up so much chaos in the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Already crumbling, Lorist complained, \u201cWhere would I find a place to teach so many students at once?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust use the school field.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at the noisy crowd of students that Charade brought over which easily numbered more than a hundred from the stone platform on the school field, Lorist exclaimed, \u201cGosh, didn\u2019t you say there were only three classes? Why are there five classes worth of students over here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade said as he laughed bitterly, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for this. Who asked you to defeat all those Silver ranked instructors within only three or four bouts? Now, the students are starting to get picky about the standards of their sword instructors and no longer want the Silver ranked instructors to teach them. That\u2019s why they\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, it appears that I have to go down for a bit. They\u2019re taking so long just to get in line, talk about discipline\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After making his rounds around the field, Lorist returned with a handful of letters of challenge. \u201cI already received more than 20 challenges in a single class! How am I supposed to survive this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at him with a sympathetic face, Charade said, \u201cWhat did you think the Enforcement Division is here for other than to regulate the students and maintain order? Now that you\u2019re a well-known figure in the academy, the administration has sent us to make sure there won\u2019t be a stampede.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can live on like this\u2026 Other instructors have almost nothing to do compared to the hundreds of challenges I\u2019ve received within three days\u2026 Even the Iron ranked students want a part in that, I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in their heads. Fatty, this brother of yours is starting to regret listening to you in the first place\u2026 The Incador Medal has brought me nothing but trouble,\u201d said Lorist miserably.</p><br/><p>Charade replied in an encouraging tone, \u201cKeep it together, brother. Even though you got a lot of challenges, I bet most of them were made in the heat of the moment. They are no threat to you, given that you can easily take care of them in two or three strikes. Even taking on twenty of them is only a warm up session for you. These are just small fry. What you should watch out for are those with actual skills that will come later. Oh, the students have got into their lines. Aren\u2019t you gonna start your class?\u201c</p><br/><p>Lorist looked at the students who were lined up messily across the field and savagely barked, \u201cPractice the eight basic sword moves for a thousand times!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ignoring the endless chatter of the head serving girl, Louise, he took a few beast skin parchments, knelt on the floor and rummaged around the rattan box, the beast skins as well as the bags, as he mused:</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo pieces of Dark-scaled Rhinoceros skin, this is Throm the Armorer\u2019s order\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFive pieces of Crimson-eyed Black Fox skin, for old Park from the leathersmith\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree pieces of Gold Python skin, Jason from the weaponsmith\u2019s needs these to make scabbards\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne Striped Wildebeest\u2019s tendon, Jecks wants to use this as a bowstring\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d said Charlando as he lifted up a greyish-white, meter-long bone.</p><br/><p>Lorist put down the roasted goose and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a legendary Razorbeak Owldragon\u2019s humerus that is used by the indigenous Remandotu people on the island as staves. It\u2019s both light and tough. I believe Sir Maleiff asked for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>According to legend, the Razorbeak Owldragon came about thousands of years ago from experiments conducted by ancient magi by cross-breeding nightowls and draconians, which resulted in the creation of a large flying beast that was savage and adept and combat. Only, it has already been extinct for a long time. The only complete skeletal specimen was only found a hundred years ago at the Relic Islands by an expedition team sent by the Magi State. It was named as such due to its seemingly large body and razor-sharp beak.</p><br/><p>Sir Malieff was one of the more high-ranking regulars of the Red Grace Inn. Rumored to be a noble from some faraway republic, he came over to Morante City and lived a life of seclusion in a house near the inn, citing his hatred of war as the main for his leaving his country. He is a man who likes to collect weird and eccentric items.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That\u2019s just another one of Sir Maleiff\u2019s eccentricities. Placing the bone down on the floor, Charlando took out a leather pouch that contained several test tube-like glass containers which contained liquids of different colors. \u201cWhat about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven types of magical beast blood, as request by Professor Simpkin of White Rose Academy. He said he got an ancient tome that detailed a recipe for a potion that required the blood of these magical beasts. He wanted to see if he could synthesize the potion mentioned in the book,\u201d explained Lorist.</p><br/><p>Only now did Charlando notice the small labels at the bottom of the containers, with names of various magical beasts, including, Dark-gold Pythons, Greenback Direwolf, Dark-scaled Rhinoceros, etc.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat old guy Simpkin sure has a lot of money to throw around. Replicating a potion? That\u2019s ludicrous! Mana doesn\u2019t even exist anymore, and the magi are not faring any better. How can you make potions without mana?\u201d mused old Tom as he shook his head incessantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about this thing?\u201d Charlando waved around a large, sealed bamboo container that was almost a meter long. Sounds of flowing liquid could be heard as he shook it around.</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026\u2026\u201d mumbled Lorist, embarrassed. He hesitated a moment before replying \u201cThat\u2019s some Terrence-donkey Whip I got for Els\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Terrence-donkey Whip was a native product of the Relic Islands which was famous for being a potent sexual stimulant. It was very popular among the nobles, especially the men whose sexual potency withered early.</p><br/><p>\u201cPffft!\u201d Upon hearing about Els\u2019s request, Louise laughed her guys out nonstop.</p><br/><p>Charlando looked grim. \u201cWhat is wrong with him\u2026 This little runt using aphrodisiacs at his ripe young age\u2026 Skirt-chasing all day long without actually doing anything useful\u2026 I gotta teach him a lesson! Leave that with me and tell Els to see me when he asks about it.</p><br/><p>Els, or Brennan Evanport, was one of the syndicate heads three districts away. He was a Two Star Silver Swordsman as well as Charlando\u2019s one and only family member; his nephew.</p><br/><p>The table was cluttered with utensils and plates. Finishing what\u2019s left of his ale and burping in satisfaction, Lorist called for McDuffin to clear the stuff up. \u201cBig sis Louise, go see if old man Luke from the back street is busy. If he isn\u2019t, I\u2019d like to get a haircut and a beard trim. Oh, and, get me a room upstairs and prepare the bath for me. And, please get the clothes in the rattan box washed and go buy me some new ones at Auntie Misha\u2019s as well. Put that bill on my tab.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Luke packed his tools and came over with little delay. At this hour, there was usually little to no customers for the barber shop behind the inn. Putting a black linen cloth around Lorist, and placing a shiny silver mirroring plate on the table that was just cleaned up by Louise, Luke took up his scissor and walrus tusk comb and asked, \u201cWould you like your usual cut?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the Grindia Continent, nobles from certain countries were expected to wear a certain hairstyle to differentiate themselves from the commoners. There was no rule for commoners though and they chose whatever hairstyle they liked, though sometimes hairstyles like ponytails gained popularity and many people followed suit. Aside from the slightly inferior barber tools, everything else pertaining to hairstyles were pretty much the same with that of Lorist\u2019s previous life.</p><br/><p>Lorist has always preferred a crew cut for two reasons: In his previous life he served as a soldier for seven years and it has become something like a habit to him. It was also much easier when it came to styling his hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, I\u2019d like the usual,\u201d replied Lorist as he straightened himself in his seat.</p><br/><p>Old Luke cleared his throat and said, \u201cActually, Locke, your hair is very lush and black. I bet you would be able to easily charm countless young maidens if you kept a ponytail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out, that kind of hairstyle requires so much effort to maintain. It\u2019s too much trouble. By the way Luke, why don\u2019t you tell me about the things that happened here during the past six months?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Luke loved to gossip when he gave haircuts. He was very well versed with the rumors and stories being passed around in the local grapevine.</p><br/><p>Luke made a thoughtful expression as he continued tending to Lorist\u2019s hair. \u201cWell, it\u2019s been pretty much the usual. Two months ago, Lind, the one who runs the roadside fruit stall, had his stall run over by a startled horse. Despite that, the owner reimbursed him with four gold Fordes and he even profited from that incident. Just last month, Watt the butcher\u2019s wife got into some trouble with a mercenary. The funny thing is: the mercenary actually got slashed in the shoulder by Watt, a person who hasn\u2019t even awakened his Battle Force! What a joke!</p><br/><p>\u201cIdle gossip aside, three months ago it was announced on the newspapers that the war in the north finally ended, most of it thanks to the various trade unions slaving away for two years nonstop. A peace treaty was signed and the northern market seemed like a gold mine to many. For two whole months the papers were filled with recruitment notices for mercenaries and northern business investment advertisements. There were also multiple reports of people getting attacked by bandits though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the Krissen Empire finally stopped attacking?\u201d Lorist really didn\u2019t expect such a big historical event occurred in the six months he went on the expedition. As for the peace treaty, nobody really treated it seriously as the Krissen Empire had been enemies with the Forde Trade Union for more than a century, during which at least three major conflicts erupted between the two powers. Why would the Trade Union bother to settle anything, given that the empire had already began to tear itself up since the start of the power struggle between the three princes for the throne of the late Krissen Emperor six years ago? It was already a blessing that the union did not take advantage of the empire\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does the treaty entail, exactly?\u201d Lorist was very curious about the specific agreements between the two powers. The northern empire\u2019s princes and dukes has been at odds with each other for almost six years now, uprooting the once stable foundations of the empire and crippling the economy, causing much poverty and famine. Even the nobles had to rely on loans to maintain daily life. If anything, it was much more believable for the trade union to have been involved in putting the empire into this predicament.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I really didn\u2019t pay much attention to the details of the treaty. I\u2019m just a barber, you know. I\u2019ve never really been into these confusing political things\u2026\u201d said old Luke with a blush.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know about it!\u201d beamed old Tom with a bright smile. As a retired postman, he has always liked to pay attention to the political undercurrents on the continent. \u201cThere were three main clauses. First, the empire is to be partitioned into three kingdoms and seven grand duchies. In other words, the Krissen Empire has ceased to exist and there will no longer be any northern invasions. Secondly, the stability and security of the trade routes are to be maintained and taxes will remain the same for all nations, regardless of whether they are kingdoms or duchies. Additionally, the subsidiaries of the trade union shall be allowed to conduct business freely in any territory. The third clause states that the trade union is to give loans to the seven nations with different interest rates ranging from 13 to 70 percent depending on the nation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Locke, aren\u2019t you a northerner yourself? I remember you riding in a carriage with some kind of insignia, usually the kind used by nobles. Given that the war is no longer ongoing, wouldn\u2019t you like to go back to your hometown for a visit?\u201d said McDuffin as he reminisced the time when he first met Lorist in front of the academy entrance ten years ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cLocke, are you really a citizen of the Krissen Empire? A noble at that?\u201d exclaimed old Luke with a surprised tone.</p><br/><p>Back when the Krissen Empire was still standing strong, conflicts between the empire and the Forde Trade Union were common and battles frequently happened on the Falik Plains. Many of the soldiers were led by the nobles who really caused the folks of the trade union a lot of grief. Although not everyone in Morante City would actually assault anyone of the empire, nobody had any good impressions on them either.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be precise, I came from the northern parts of the Krissen Empire; I\u2019m a northern highlander. The highlands should be located thousands of kilometers from here, which is way too far and impractical for soldiers over there to come over. The march itself would take more than three months. My father was a baron and his barony was situated in the far north. I have an elder brother as well as a younger brother. I guess that makes me the second son, which means I won\u2019t be inheriting the barony at any rate. The fact that I\u2019m so far out here means that my family has abandoned me. I\u2019ve had to rely on myself for seven whole years since I lost all contact with them. That\u2019s why I now consider myself a Moranite and have nothing to do with the north or my family anymore,\u201d explained Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Many nobles send away every child but the heir to the land to prevent infighting and strife, usually by means of exile, separation or marriage. Locke\u2019s case is pretty common. After all, his family does have a hereditary title,\u201d appended old Tom.</p><br/><p>Luke worked quickly and finished the haircut as well as the shave. He ended the session by applying a final layer of oil to moisturize the skin.</p><br/><p>Lorist stroked his clean-shaven chin with satisfaction and paid old Luke a small silver coin. He subsequently asked McDuffin to get Luke and Tom a glass of ale and put it on his tab. He took his swords and went upstairs with Louise.</p><br/><p>There were eight rooms on the second floor of the inn, four on each side of the corridor.</p><br/><p>As they arrived on the second floor, loud sounds of men and women during intercourse resounded throughout the corridor.</p><br/><p>Lorist asked with much curiosity, \u201cWho is the one getting it on at this kind of time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jumile. She picked up the three Blackbear brothers from the streets for seven large silvers. They\u2019ve been at it for three hours or so. I wonder if she can still get up tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJumile was also one of the serving girls of the inn. As for the Blackbear brothers, Lorist knew for a fact that all three of them were low-ranked mercenaries, usually only working on short escort missions and miscellaneous tasks for others. All three of them were burly and tanned and people started calling them the Blackbear brothers and eventually, the name caught on and stuck.</p><br/><p>Louise brought Lorist to his room, which was situated at the far right end of the corridor. The bathtub was already set up and filled with hot water.</p><br/><p>Taking out a pink fragrant bar of soap and a white linen cloth, she subsequently collected the clothes on the ground and placed the wallet, the sword belt and the waist bag on the table and was just going to leave, before turning back and asking, \u201cLocke, are you free on the night three days from now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, what for?\u201d Lorist popped out from the water and took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this girl from the village who wants to work here as a serving girl. She\u2019s looking to sell her first time for quite the sum, about two gold coins. Since you\u2019ve made quite a profit this time around, why don\u2019t you help me out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Doesn\u2019t the inn already have you, Jumile, Shala and Nina? Is it going to hire another one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNina just got married last month and isn\u2019t coming back. The girl from my village is also going to work here for two to three years for some money before going back to the village and finding someone to marry. I promised her that her first client would be a handsome and magnanimous young lad. Come on Locke, help me out, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll think about it later,\u201d said Lorist in an awkward muffled voice and submerged his head back into the bathwater.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

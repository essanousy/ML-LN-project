Urgent class documents contained information concerning household interests directly, and that needed immediate attention. They were usually sent via eagle and were thus short, concise, bare on the details, and in very simple terms. Secret class documents contained sensitive information, which could be about something concerning the household itself, or other forces, factions, places, people, or circumstances, that had to remain confidential either due to the content or nature of the information, or what the fact that House Norton possessed the information implied about its espionage activities or its possible future interests or actions. The documents were usually very thorough but at the same time somewhat circumspect. Due to their sensitive nature, the utmost care was taken to ensure the details inside were as accurate as possible, and any transport or storage of the documents was done under the utmost scrutiny. The queen\u2019s affair would have been one such report, but Lorist didn\u2019t care about its news spreading and wanted such news at the utmost speed, so it was handled as urgent instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Charade asked from his place on a nearby chair.</p><br/><p>Jinolio opened the folder and glanced over its contents.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a rebellion in the Trade Union. It started on the 15th of the 9th. Duke Cobleit mobilized Twinhead Dragon\u2019s legion to purge the rebels. More than twenty guilds have been wiped out, seventeen completely, and the rest mostly. It says the prime suspect is Marquis Krilos, Twinhead Dragon\u2019s old vice-president. He reached out to the nobles dissatisfied with Cobleit\u2019s leadership and staged a coup.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s now vanished and Duke Cobleit has declared him a traitor. The duke also put a bounty of 10 thousand gold on his head. He also enacted a few new policies changing the peerage. Nobles no longer hold titles to land, they only gain social status and an annual stipend. He\u2019s sent ambassadors to the neighbouring nations to reassure them that he\u2019s in control and that peace will continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist looked amused.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems this more like a rebirth than a revolt. Cobleit is quite a talented man. He clearly intends to play the game seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this Krilos?\u201d Charade asked, more interested in the revolt\u2019s instigator.</p><br/><p>\u201cMarquis Krilos was the ambassador sent to the peace negotiations with the windstorm swordsaint. The one the king declared a fraud and sent back to the Union in feathers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, him.\u201d Lorist mouthed absentmindedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he still alive? Wasn\u2019t he covered in raw lacquer? He should\u2019ve died from poisoning. How\u2019s he still up and about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing covered in raw lacquer won\u2019t necessarily kill you. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s actual poison. What\u2019s so weird about him still being alive?\u201d Jinolio countered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve seen something like this personally. There was a lacquer shop next to my house when I was still a child. A horse barged into it one day and knocked a large bucket of raw lacquer over. The lacquer fell on a nearby worker\u2026 He died of an allergic reaction two days later. His skin blistered. His employer hired the city\u2019s greatest herbalist, but he could do nothing. The blisters festered, and he committed suicide a week later. The horse also got some on its fur and died a couple weeks later as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lacquer shop was forced to close after the scandal. The big-seven guilds required that all workers wear protective gear from then on. The job became very expensive as well since people demanded greater pay for the dangerous work. I spent a few years studying the lacquer at Dawn Academy trying to find out what cause the reaction, but I was no closer to discovering the secret behind its poison when I left with His Grace than when I started.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jinolio rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make yourself sound like an expert if you don\u2019t actually know anything. Marquis Krilos was a blademaster when that happened, the lacquer wouldn\u2019t have killed him. He was also a noble, he no doubt hired excellent herbalists to treat him. Besides, a lot of time passed between your tinkering and his punishment, I\u2019m sure someone thought of a better treatment in that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade was rendered speechless. He grabbed Jinolio in a fit of rage and ruffled his hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little... When did your balls grow big enough to talk back to me? Let\u2019s see how I deal with you...\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist didn\u2019t know how to what to do, so he took the documents from the wrestling pair and skimmed them while he waited for things to calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he eventually had to get involved when things didn\u2019t calm down, \u201cCharade, you\u2019re my chief knight and Jinolio\u2019s senior. You\u2019re basically his uncle as well. Don\u2019t go too far, Jinolio will eventually be your brat\u2019s senior, and in a great position to pick on him if you push him too far now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe would dare?\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade let go of Jinolio and opened another bottle of blackcurrant wine. His haste to get to work had vanished when the Trade Union came up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Grace can rest assured now. I doubt the revolt was anything less than a complete bloody massacre. Most of the nobles must have been put down and thousands of peasants executed. This may have secured Cobleit\u2019s position, but I doubt the Union can recover from this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. We should be more wary of the Union instead. Cobleit got the perfect excuse to kill off everyone who opposed him. His position is now more secure than it has ever been. Even if a few detractors escaped his purge, which I doubt, they no longer have the power to oppose him. He holds absolute power in the country and can have them killed for whatever reason he wishes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCobleit will no doubt start consolidating his position and the Union\u2019s remaining strength. He\u2019ll first focus on developing his remaining territory. In service of that he\u2019ll no doubt overhaul the entire political and legal system. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if eight-tenths of all the Union\u2019s laws will either be replaced or amended. I give the current peace a decade. He\u2019ll start threatening his neighbours before the next ten years are up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you overestimating Cobleit? He no longer has access to the markets like he used to. We dominate them all. He\u2019ll have to fight us if he wants to get back into the market, and he\u2019ll have to do it without a good foundation with which to compete. We all know they can\u2019t compete with us in either volume or quality. How could they possible supplant us?\u201d Charade argued.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. We make more and better goods. But the Union has far more experience at mass production than we do. They may never be able to match our quality, but they sure can compete with us in terms of volume, especially where heavy industry is concerned. Tell me, who did their lands belong to before them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeribo, Teria, and Mokby. So the Union is going to focus on glass?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Most likely oil and green glass. We make a lot of glassware and sell a lot of it to the Alliance, but no one buys oil glass or green glass from us. The reason is simple. We are too far for the transport of those items to be profitable. They can\u2019t be sold for a high price so merchants can\u2019t make a profit if they buy from us, transport all the way south, and then sell there.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore we started producing our own glass, we bought everything from the Kenmayses. But the transport costs turned the cheapest glass in Morante into unbelievable luxuries here. And even then the Kenmeyses barely made a profit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the main reason why I didn\u2019t spare any effort to get the recipe from Teribo. The market here in the north is immense, and we can sell much cheaper than any competitors and still make a massive profit. But the same problem the Kenmayses had with getting glass here to the north counts for us when we want to send glass to the south.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Trade Union cannot steal our market here, but similarly we can\u2019t compete with them there, at least not where oil and green glass are concerned. Even if we sell at cost, they can still undercut us and still make a profit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeribo relied on selling oil and green glass to make his fortunes. The Union is now doing the same. The market is also perfect for it now. The kingdoms have been ravaged by war and are busy rebuilding. Glassware was no doubt the thing most broken during the various raids and pillages, so everyone will want to re-buy everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe entire continent is also at peace for once, well, the parts that matter, anyway, which is perfect for trade. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the Union is back on its feet and rearing to get revenge and take back its lost glory. Cobleit did exactly what I proposed to Jindoz: turning the landed nobility into honorary nobility.</p><br/><p>\u201cLimiting salt sales and upping their prices won\u2019t be enough to keep the Union at bay anymore. The Union can just smuggle it in, they certainly have the know-how and the connections. Our only saving grace is that they\u2019re in one of the worst possible geographic locations for commerce. They\u2019re land-locked and surrounded by mountain ranges and other impassable terrain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Grace is overestimating the Union. If they\u2019re really this eager to keep the fight going, why not just march back south and wipe them out for good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jinolio nodded frantically as well. He was a little too fervent in his belief of the Norton forces\u2019 invulnerability.</p><br/><p>Lorist laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what casus belli would we use? We better have a damn good excuse to break the peace treaty so soon after signing it. Otherwise no one will ever trust either us or the soon-to-be emperor again. No, this is beyond us now. We can\u2019t make a move again until we\u2019re asked for help.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should focus on supporting the Free Union and strengthen our grip on Morante and its markets. As long as we maintain control there, the Union can only become a local powerhouse, it won\u2019t be able to threaten the empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade and Jinolio nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Lorist asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jinolio answered, \u201cLundmorde is here for a visit with his four wives and five children.\u201d replied Jinolio.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Every time his father hosted a banquet, the hall would always be filled to the brim with people enjoying delicious food and big mugs of ale. The partygoers that made merry throughout the banquets would always leave the floors in a terrible mess.</p><br/><p>Lorist realized that the dining hall Shadekampf and Patt were leading him to wasn\u2019t the one within his memories after they took a different turn. He asked curiously, \u201cIsn\u2019t the dining hall over there? Why are we heading here instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shadekampf asked, \u201cYoung Master, you still remember where the dining hall is at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, I\u2019ve only been away for ten years you know. I can still recall bits of my childhood,\u201d said Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, we\u2019re not heading to the main dining hall. After the Old Master passed away, it hasn\u2019t been used ever since. We\u2019re heading to the smaller one,\u201d said Shadekampf.</p><br/><p>The smaller dining hall Shadekampf was referring to was a small wooden hut that was built outside the kitchen. With the walls and flooring all constructed from wood and a large wooden long table within, it could house around ten people. Beyond the long wooden table was a bricked fireplace that was currently lit with several pieces of meat on metal sticks sizzling above the brazier that was right next to it.</p><br/><p>A chubby cooking lady brought a large basin on the table within which a large, steaming bread was placed. On it was a saw-toothed knife. Taking the knife out, Shadekampf cut off three smaller pieces from the bread and handed them to Lorist. \u201cYoung Master, eat them while they\u2019re hot. It tastes pretty good, especially with some salt and honey that you can find on the table.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cooking lady then brought another large bowl of potato and rib stew before she served the meat that was being grilled atop the brazier. Lastly, she put a bowl of baked apples onto the table and sprinkled it with some maple syrup.</p><br/><p>\u201cDinner is served,\u201d said the cooking lady coldly before she left with a gloomy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with her? Did I wrong her in some way?\u201d said Shadekampf in a surprised tone as he looked towards Patt.</p><br/><p>Patt merely shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wrong her in any way. But she\u2019s unhappy that you brought back the Second Young Master,\u201d said Pesha as she entered the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would that piss her off?\u201d Shadekampf continued to question.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe used to be one of the Old Master\u2019s personal maidservants and she bore him a son. Even though he was merely an illegitimate one, the blood of the Nortons still flows within his veins. If the Second Young Master didn\u2019t make his way back, the next family head would naturally be chosen among the other illegitimate sons,\u201d explained the red-haired female knight as she pulled out the knife that was stuck within the bread and used it to cut a maple syrup-covered apple she took out from the bowl into several small pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only a pipe dream of hers,\u201d Patt commented.</p><br/><p>\u201cLIttle Locke, what is your Battle Force rank?\u201d asked the female knight casually as she stuffed a piece of the apple into her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIron,\u201d Lorist replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still an Iron rank after spending ten years at Morante City? Sigh, I guess you truly are the most useless one among you three brothers. Little Locke, let me put this out first, it\u2019s not that I am against you being the family leader, since there is nobody other than you have the most rightful claim to the position. However, you should remember this. First, don\u2019t even dare to mess with my affairs as you have no right! Second, the Norton Family is in a bad state, so we can\u2019t afford to have you messing around with it. That\u2019s why you should stay in the castle obediently after you inherit the position, understand?\u201d said the female knight as she glared at Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, you don\u2019t understand\u2026 The Young Master is\u2026\u201d uttered Shadekampf.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! Know your place!\u201d Pesha roared.</p><br/><p>Lorist merely nodded.</p><br/><p>As if she had won the argument, the woman humphed in satisfaction and took wide steps out of the room with her chest puffed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mistress thinks too much of herself,\u201d said Shadekampf.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s merely a frog at the bottom of the well who can\u2019t even fathom the existence of the world outside it,\u201d said Patt.</p><br/><p>Lorist said, \u201cShadekampf, Patt, after you\u2019ve finished your meals, go gather some information about the situation here in the castle. I feel that something is off and that the people here isn\u2019t too fond of my return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, we\u2019re here,\u201d said Patt as he took out the key Gleis had given him and unlocked the door to the study.</p><br/><p>Having been closed off for quite a period of time, the air in the study smelled stuffy and stale. Patt quickly opened the windows to let some fresh air into the room.</p><br/><p>After that, Patt said, \u201cYoung Master, I\u2019ll be leaving now. If you have anything you need, I\u2019ll be waiting by the stairwell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist nodded and headed for the desk at the back of the study.</p><br/><p>He recalled that his late father, Baron Norton, used to give out orders while sitting behind that exact desk.</p><br/><p>Opening the drawer of the desk, he found some old account books and notes as well as another iron box. He remembered that within the box was the Battle Force manual that was passed down within the family. After opening the iron box, a thick beastskin book was revealed before his eyes and on its cover were four large words with an ancient air: \u2018Crimsonblood Battle Force\u2019.</p><br/><p>Lorist was stunned. Wasn\u2019t the hereditary family Battle Force the Blazing Battle Force? Since when has it become the Crimsonblood Battle Force?</p><br/><p>As his mind sifted through the memories of the young Lorist, he recalled a peculiar scene. As the young Lorist was copying the Battle Force manual, he asked his elder brother, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>His brother replied, \u201cI\u2019m making a new book jacket for Pesha. The one she had is already in quite a sorry state, so I\u2019m making another for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young Lorist then said, \u201cI want one too, brother. You must be fair to both Pesha and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, good thing I have two over here. I\u2019ll give the smaller one to you,\u201d his brother replied. He then handed Lorist a beastskin book jacket with the words \u2018Blazing Battle Force\u2019 on it for Lorist to cover his hand copy of the first two stages of his Battle Force technique with.</p><br/><p>What the heck! That stupid child and his stupid brother! Lorist didn\u2019t know whether he should laugh or cry at the blunder that had caused him to think that his Battle Force was of the fire attribute and made him waste so much time researching other Battle Force manuals, only to end up with him deciding to train in the Aquametal Technique that was passed down to him in his previous life.</p><br/><p>Had he known that the technique he trained in was called the Crimsonblood Battle Force, Lorist would have purchased the Burning Blood Battle Force manual that was put up on sale at the mercenary guild of Morante City. Given that it was a blood attribute high-ranked Battle Force technique, it was considered a rare treasure by the mercenary guild and was priced at a staggering 15000 gold Fordes.</p><br/><p>The main difference between blood attribute techniques and that of other attributes was that no matter what attribute one\u2019s original awakened Battle Force was, upon training in a blood attribute technique, one\u2019s Battle Force attribute would irreversibly change into the blood type as well. That was also why Lorist didn\u2019t bother to buy a blood attribute Battle Force technique in Morante City during his days of research, as apart from the one one sale at the mercenary guild, there wasn\u2019t any other place where he could find a blood attribute technique.</p><br/><p>Flipping the manual open, he saw the first two chapters that detailed the basic hexagonal blood circulation map that he was familiar with. After that was the chapter for the Silver ranked stage of the technique. Reading the main points and memorizing the differences between nodes of the Iron rank circulation path and that of the Silver rank, Lorist circulated his Battle Force and moved it according to the Silver ranked path\u2026</p><br/><p>He then drew his sword and a blade glow emanated from it after he injected the sword with his Battle Force. Giving a bitter laugh, he thought, I\u2019ve finally broke through the Silver rank. However, my blade glow won\u2019t be able to hold for long as my Battle Force still dissipates into my meridians and dantian region. Without the Battle Force circulating in my bloodstream, I won\u2019t be able to sustain the blade glow for long. Oh well, I guess I\u2019ll still pass myself off as an Iron rank to catch people off guard with my Dark Stage power.</p><br/><p>A few knocks rang out at the door of the study.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter,\u201d said Lorist.</p><br/><p>A girl dressed in a white gown entered the study and gave Lorist a quick glance before lowering her head. \u201cSecond Young Master, your bedroom is already prepared. Just take a turn when you get up the stairs and you\u2019ll reach it. Oh, your bedsheets have also been switched as well. When you want to take a bath, please ring the bell with the blue rope beside your bed and I\u2019ll start preparing the bathwater quickly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s voice gradually grew softer and softer until she was less audible than a mosquito.</p><br/><p>Lorist felt that it was funny how the girl was so afraid of himself. He waved his hand and said, \u201cYou may leave now. I will call for you when necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if she was granted amnesty, the girl bowed her head another time before she left hastily and almost bumped into Shadekampf who had just entered from the door.</p><br/><p>Shadekampf looked at the girl and said, \u201cIrina, it\u2019s you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Shadekampf closed the door to the study, Lorist asked him, \u201cDo you know the girl from before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s called Irina and she was originally the Third Young Master\u2019s personal maidservant and she\u2019s older than him by one year. She\u2019s the one who grieved the most at the passing of the Third Young Master and cried day and night,\u201d Shadekampf replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any news for me?\u201d Lorist asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Young Master. You wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine how heated the quarrel for the position of the family head has been among the various factions in the family. However, the moment you returned, the fight suddenly died down as they had no more hope for it,\u201d said Shadekampf with a smile, as if something funny had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny about that? Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, despite dating the First Young Master for a couple of years now, not only did Mistress Pesha not bear any children for him, he even found another maidservant which he had a son with immediately after merely two encounters. Mistress Pesha had intended to make that son inherit the position of the family head, but that notion had been struck down by the rest of the family. Being put in an awkward position, your return has made it easier for Mistress Pesha to step down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would the others be against the son of my brother being the next family head?\u201d Lorist asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, that child is only 4 years old and can be considered your junior by a whole generation. That\u2019s why the mistress\u2019s claim was disapproved by many.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are the ones who didn\u2019t agree with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you should be wary of Molocinque, who\u2019s the first illegitimate son of your father and is the eldest of the bunch. I heard that he has obtained the support of the families of the garrison of Wildnorth Town, which was the main reason why he wasn\u2019t approved as a candidate for the next family head. Also, half a year back when the Kenmays Family surrounded our castle with their troops, the 7th illegitimate son of your father, Wellickson, has shown his bravery and performed very well in fending off the enemy. He has quite a lot of support from the elderly within the castle. The last one is the son of the cooking lady from before. She had tried to get the rest of the servants to support his son to become the next family head. Two other of your father\u2019s other personal maidservants also felt that their sons would be fit for the family head, however, causing the servants to split into three factions which argued all the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop\u2026 Shadekampf, how many illegitimate sons and daughters does my father have?\u201d Lorist\u2019s head started to hurt. The situation he was in was not much different from the dramas in his previous life that depicted the squabbles of rich families. He didn\u2019t expect that even his illegitimate brothers were also gunning for the position of the family head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are 17 illegitimate children. If we include you and your two brothers, the Old Master had 20 children in total,\u201d replied Shadekampf hesitantly. \u201cIncluding you, there are only 11 that are still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they all males?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, milord. There are four illegitimate daughters, two of which are already married with the other two still only in their teens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen does that mean all the living illegitimate sons are part of the power struggle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, milord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand now,\u201d Lorist said. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering why the family hasn\u2019t taken any action and allowed the Kenmays Family to do as they please. So the bastards have all decided to pretend to not notice these matters until the family head is decided and even ignored the wellbeing of those working in the mine\u2026 How ridiculous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shadekampf felt curious and asked, \u201cWhy did Old Butler Gleis leave them to squabble among themselves without doing anything about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Gleis himself wasn\u2019t sure if I would come back to the dominion to inherit the position. What if Patt and you couldn\u2019t find me or something bad happened to us along the journey? That\u2019s why he let them do as they pleased so that the tallest among the dwarves will be picked just in case I wasn\u2019t able to make my way back so that the family bloodline can still continue,\u201d explained Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that you\u2019ve returned. Now, they no longer have a reason to continue that squabble,\u201d said Shadekampf with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why the people here aren\u2019t too happy of my return at all. I was the one who caused all the drama to cease. Oh well, it\u2019s getting late. Where will you and Patt be sleeping tonight?\u201d Lorist asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be using the guest room by the stairs. I\u2019ll be alternating with Patt for patrolling during the night, so please rest well, milord.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

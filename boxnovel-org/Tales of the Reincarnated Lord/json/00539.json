Teacher arrived early,\u201d said Bolyde with utmost respect as he saluted Lorist.</p><br/><p>The other disciples spread out and surrounded the mountain. They appeared to be guarding the surroundings so nobody would interrupt the duel.</p><br/><p>Lorist nodded. He turned to Reidy and Jinolio.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay here, or go back if you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reidy glanced at Bolyde.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait here, Teacher. We pray for your victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist waved them off and dismounted before climbing the mountains.</p><br/><p>This mountain had no path to the peak. The lower half had some greenery, mainly shrubs and grass, but the upper half was bare. It stood far from the coast and there were little in the way of prevailing winds, so no moisture was blown up it to wet the top. Only the hardiest of plants broke rock here and there.</p><br/><p>The peak was a single, solid mass of gray rock. Lorist kicked up from a hole in the mountain and impaled a ledge with his sword before flipping off and ascending further. He peaked several flips later. The top was leveled, about a hundred meters square. A few hairline cracks danced like lightning in the shifting light, but the surface was stable. A few boulders lay on this surface, but not enough to severely hinder movement.</p><br/><p>Lorist wondered where his opponent was. Had he not come early? Wind suddenly rose from behind him, lifting his cape and making it flap about aimlessly. He turned around and saw the battlefield stretched out from the bottom of the mountain to Bluwek. The two sides, like two blobs, covered two sides of the flatlands below. He felt like he should hear horns blaring and officers barking orders, but the sounds were long washed out by the time the wind reached him.</p><br/><p>As he perked his ears to see if he could hear any lingering noise of the war beneath, he heard a gentle flutter behind him. He turned his gaze and saw the old swordsaint lumbering his way up the last couple of meters of slope. His face was slightly flush and his breathing heavier than would be expected of a swordsaint.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you are as old as me, your bones don\u2019t hold up as well as they used to. Apologies for showing you such a sight, Your Grace,\u201d the old man said shamelessly, bowing slightly, \u201cGreetings Duke Norton. I am grateful for your acceptance. Looks like this old man won\u2019t have to lose face.\u201d</p><br/><p>How odd. What was the old man up to? Why was he being so polite? Was he not an arrogant fool?</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d Lorist opened his mouth to speak, but the old man\u2019s name escaped him. That Count Kris-whatsisname introduced him as Master Ma-something-ut...</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t be bothered to trawl the name up from his memory.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we get going?\u201d he snapped, unsheathing his sword.</p><br/><p>The sooner he could finish, the sooner he could return to the battlefield. He was anxious. His plans were thorough, but he could not afford to be absent if something untoward happened.</p><br/><p>The old man just shrugged and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo rush. Let\u2019s rest for a bit. I\u2019m old. I\u2019m not nearly as energetic as you. You can at least give this old man some time to catch his breath, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist stared at the old man, speechless.</p><br/><p>What the hell? Is this his house?! He even dares sit down! He\u2019s not worried I\u2019ll strike him like this at all?!</p><br/><p>Then again, they were fifteen meters apart. Even if he dashed at full speed, the old man would still have enough time to react.</p><br/><p>Whatever, just rest if you need it so badly. There\u2019s no point in rushing. Shoved his sword into the stone and returned his attention to the battlefield.</p><br/><p>From this vantage point, Falik Plains looked like a large chessboard, but the Union occupied two-thirds of it. Little squared of men checkered the landscape all the way to the horizon. The squares closest to his forces had been whittled down and were just small, scattered dots. He could just barely make out clumps where large numbers of men had died together, and a few pebble like dots sat scattered between them, probably shield carts of one kind or another.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem rather confident in your forces. Is that why you\u2019re fighting the battle on the same day as our duel? Where do you get that confidence? The Union is advancing very well. Your men are well-trained, but they\u2019re completely outnumbered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHad enough rest? Then let\u2019s fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnxious to get to join the battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist didn\u2019t answer, but his face betrayed him.</p><br/><p>The old swordsaint chortled.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrien-- Lord Norton. It\u2019s true I challenged you to a duel, but the truth is I don\u2019t want to fight you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you challenge me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man tapped the rock beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why I thanked you for accepting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist shook his head.</p><br/><p>Since you asked for a beating, I\u2019ll give you want. I was having trouble finding you but now you\u2019ve come to me. I should be the thankful one. With you out of the picture the Union will crumble. Why would I not grab such a chance?\"</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been a swordsaint for long, so you probably don\u2019t know much about our way of doing things. But you\u2019ll learn in good time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that have to duel with our duel? Weren\u2019t we both heavily injured in our last fight? You challenged me after you recovered because you want to get payback, right? I didn\u2019t get enough in our last fight, so I want to fight you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man burst into a short bout of laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t issue the challenge with the intention to fight. I know taking you on will be torturous and I\u2019ll probably be just as badly injured as before. My old bones can\u2019t take it anymore. Everyone knows about our last fight. If I didn\u2019t challenge you they\u2019d think I was afraid of you and I\u2019d lose most of the respect and reputation I\u2019ve earned. I had to challenge you to preserve my honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a swordsaint, one of just a handful on the continent. We have transcended the ruling classes. Nobody dares offend us. Even in wars we don\u2019t have to fight. We prefer it that way since we\u2019d rather not fight and kill one another. There are few enough of us already, no need to lower that number ourselves. We don\u2019t care which of us is considered the strongest. I doubt anyone would have a problem with you being put at the top of our rankings. You\u2019re welcome to it. You\u2019re a noble as well as a swordsaint, the rest of us are commoners. We may have high statuses, but they\u2019re symbolic only. We have no real power.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seen as these sages, divorced of the mundane world, our only pursuit perfection of our cultivation. We are respected and stand equal even to kings and emperors in the eyes of the people, but we have no authority. We only fight to preserve our reputation so we can hold on to what little freedom and influence we have. That\u2019s why I challenged you.</p><br/><p>\u201cChallenges are usually accepted as easily as this one. Most of the time a lot of conditions are negotiated first. We don\u2019t face each other often as a result. Most fights are spars between friendly swordsaints. I am grateful that you accepted my challenge without a fuss. I will repay this favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist finally understood what was going on. The swordsaint wanted to put up a facade of a duel for the rest of the world to preserve his honor, but in reality he just wanted to chat. Even if he returned without a scratch, he could claim to have fought Lorist to a draw. It was far better than having to escape injury-ridden. And, given his status, there would be no need to try so hard on behalf of the Union, anyway.</p><br/><p>Lorist was different. Like the old man had said, Lorist was a noble as well as a swordsaint. He had a domain and millions of people depending on him. He could not sit by like a detached bystander and just watch the fight play out either way. He had to make sure his forces won.</p><br/><p>He prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not be hasty now,\u201d the old man hastened to stop him.</p><br/><p>Lorist frowned and clutched his sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to stop me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a swordsaint. Why bother with such petty things? We must not be too involved in the world of mortals. Even if you\u2019re a duke, you can\u2019t lead every charge, can you? You must be confident in your forces being able to win in your absence, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have set the battle on the same day as our duel. Why not watch it from here? We might be powerful, but swordsaints can\u2019t single-handedly change the outcomes of battles such as these.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you make a deal with the Union concerning me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man nodded shamelessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot let you take part in the battle, so I cannot let you descend the mountain until the battle is over. Besides, a duel between swordsaints cannot end this quickly. No one will believe we\u2019ve fought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Lorist\u2019s glare froze. \u201cDo you really think you can keep me here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI admit I\u2019m not your match. But stopping you from leaving is not the same as winning the fight. I have several strategies to lock you down on this peak even if I can\u2019t win. I\u2019d prefer not to have to fight you, however. There\u2019s no point in us being enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what did they promise you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe duchy of Walinya. Well, they didn\u2019t offer it to me, I demanded it. It\u2019s one of the smaller duchies south of the Union, near Jigda. It used to be a protectorate of Kalia. It\u2019s about the same size as one of your empire\u2019s provinces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure the Union will really give it to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t dare lie to a swordsaint. As long as I keep you here until the battle ends and I\u2019m not badly injured, they\u2019ll give it to me. They\u2019d like nothing more than for the two of us to fight one another until we\u2019re just barely still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, old man,\u201d Lorist interjected, \u201ceven if you get Walinya, aren\u2019t you afraid the swordsaints from the Romon and Khawistan will come after you? I heard they chased you out of Kalia by working together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist suddenly felt a desire to gossip. He had nothing better to do up here, so why not?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. Kalia wasn\u2019t ruined because I was chased out of the kingdom. It was ruined because I and the king had irreconcilable differences. I would have liked to kill the old bastard, but I couldn\u2019t if I wanted to preserve my reputation, so for years I\u2019d just sequestered myself away and ignored the king. The two empires didn\u2019t dare make a move as long as I was in the kingdom, though. One day I received a letter from the two empire\u2019s swordsaints saying they\u2019d been asked to work together to chase me out of the kingdom or kill me so the two empires could split it up. It was the perfect excuse to get out, so I played along and pretended to be chased out of the kingdom by the two after a serious fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing a swordsaint comes with a lot of annoying shackles. I realized when I first came across you and learned you were both a swordsaint and a noble that I can only really be free if I am both a noble and a swordsaint. So I demanded land and a title in exchange for keeping you out of the fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>A loud, sky-shattering rumble burst up the mountain from the lands below. A line of smoke rose up from Lorist\u2019s forces, and towers of smoke rose from semi-random positions on the Union\u2019s side. Their formations instantly crumbled. Soon after a soft blur of cries and wails clawed its way through the air to the peak.</p><br/><p>Lorist finally breathed again and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you still want to go back to the battlefield?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe battle\u2019s over. The Union lost. I don\u2019t need to go back in a hurry anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man jumped up and stared at the battlefield. Smoke covered most of it, but he could just make out the Union\u2019s side retreating like ants on a table after someone hit it. The enemy side\u2019s formation was also breaking up like a flood as it rushed over the battlefield, chasing the retreating Union.</p><br/><p>\u201cGah!\u201d cried the old man suddenly. He drew his sword and slashed the rock closest to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe heck are you up to?\u201d asked Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, help me. Leave a few sword marks on the rocks over there. This is the sacred ground of a swordsaint duel. We must leave some signs of the intense battle. You take that side, I\u2019ll take this one, we can swap once we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You think Count Wecksas is only being used as a puppet?\u201d asked Kenmays.</p><br/><p>Lorist, Kenmays, Felim, and Shazin were heading to Jillin Harbor, the capital shrinking on the horizon behind them. They were accompanied by their family and forces. Their destination was Silowas, where they\u2019d regroup and discuss what to do next.</p><br/><p>The others were surprised that Lorist would turn his back on the king so resolutely. If Auguslo declared him a traitor, Andinaq would once again taste civil war. As his allies, they, too, would be dragged in against the rest of the kingdom.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, you can stand with the king and turn on Lorist if you want,\u201d Kenmays told Shazin and Felim.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not idiots,\u201d the two immediately answered.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they hadn\u2019t considered it, but, given the king\u2019s personality, they would be used as cannon fodder. The king would never trust them. Siding with Lorist was the better choice. Even if they were wiped out, they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about Lorist swallowing them. He would instead help them rebuild.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lorist replied glumly, \u201cYou told me Andalou got into a trade war with you for the salt market last year, right? They suffered at least 100 thousand gold Fordes in losses. Think about it. That isn\u2019t a small sum. Andalou should\u2019ve been in bad shape. Tell, me, do they look hampered?</p><br/><p>\u201cAndalou isn\u2019t like the Trade Union\u2019s guilds. It\u2019s a new establishment with shallow roots and even shallower pockets, or at least they should be, so how did they get out of this without collapsing? Someone is obviously footing the bill on their behalf, and who has that kind of money in this desolate kingdom besides the king? Then not long after you\u2019re suddenly targeted by a blademaster? Tell me, what upstart guild can afford to order a blademaster around, much less after just suffering a crushing defeat?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can easily conclude who the mastermind behind Andalou is. Do you think a mere bastard child can plot against a duke like you? Can he take such a loss, not to mention sending a blademaster after you? Somebody is backing him. Do we even need to guess who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kenmays paled. Lorist made him incredibly nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why would the king want to lay his hands on salt merchant committee. I\u2019m just a merchant. I didn\u2019t touch any of his industries. I\u2019m not a threat either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou underestimate your importance,\u201d Lorist smiled, \u201cThe war is over. Everyone knows we\u2019ll have several decades of peace. Now that there are no more external threats, the king has to start considering internal ones. What, other than our alliance, could spark his worry? Nothing. If he wants to implement some kind of nationwide policy, he\u2019ll have to go through us. He is desperate to break us up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suspect he set his sights on salt merchant committee because you\u2019re the sole common interest binding the four houses together. Shazin and Felim in particular are recovering quickly thanks to the kickbacks from the committee. They are rebuilding their militaries quickly as well. He first tried destroying the committee, now, failing that, he\u2019s targeting you.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was only a wild guess at first, but when I learnt that the bastard child was harassing the nobles and saw how his guild could bring out a gold rank guard, my suspicions deepened. How could Andalou have such a strong force without the king? Even the committee only uses silver ranks.</p><br/><p>\u201cD\u2019you remember the king\u2019s fury when I had their guards killed? It was like a child\u2019s toy had been broken. He was also way too keen to get an answer out of me. I knew it was him when I saw that. What else can I say at this point? Why should I care about his reputation? I\u2019ll just leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Felim, who had been listening from the side, nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLocke is right. What do you think the king will do next? Declare us traitors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care whether we\u2019re traitors or not,\u201d Shazin added, \u201cWe can win any war he starts. Other than House Fisablen, no one is willing to fight to the death for that man\u2019s sake. Most will probably only voice their support while finding excuses to sit on the sidelines. I\u2019m most worried that the king will try to catch us before we reach Jillin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone fell silent. They didn\u2019t have the forces to far the entire imperial guard right now. It would be very bad if he sent his army after them before they got to Jillin. Lorist could cause him some damage, but even he could not win against an entire legion on his own. Not to mention their family were still here and could easily be turned into hostages against </p><br/><p>\u201cIf he really does something like that, we\u2019ll turn against him for good. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be quite that reckless. He\u2019d be betting his entire bloodline and legacy on very unfavorable odds, and he knows it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should stay on guard just in case, though. We still have two days of travel ahead before we reach Jillin. I\u2019ve left a few men at the gates to keep an eye on the enemy army. They\u2019ll let us know as soon as the enemy begin mobilizing. If it comes to it, we\u2019ll send our families ahead and hold the enemy at bay until they\u2019ve reached safety.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t win a determined fight, but we can keep them busy long enough. We don\u2019t have worry about Jillin\u2019s garrison. They\u2019re practically my men.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kenmays sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you won\u2019t allow the king to interfere with Jillin. Everything will be fine as long as the garrison stays with us. I doubt the legion is enough to hold us. Everything will be fine once we reach Jillin. We\u2019ll secede from the Andinaq and make Lorist king. We can settle our debt once we\u2019ve stabilized the situation thereafter.\u201d</p><br/><p>It would most likely take the rest of the year to set everything up, but they could attack after winter and have half the kingdom in their hands in two years. Given their vast influence, they could easily turn the rest of the kingdom\u2019s nobles to their side and wipe out the empire within five years.</p><br/><p>Lorist shook his head</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not time for something like that yet. People will think we were planning this from the beginning and believe the king\u2019s claims that we are traitors, rather than the victims. We should do nothing but take up our defenses. We should definitely not act before he does. Our secession should be a reaction to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Felim sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLocke, it\u2019s not that I want to criticize you, but you\u2019re too soft. Don\u2019t worry so much about your reputation as a loyal vassal, it\u2019ll do you no good once you\u2019re a sovereign. If we declare independence after he makes his claim, people will believe we\u2019re doing damage control. We\u2019ll be the rebels that wanted to take over the kingdom but got caught out. No one will accept our declaration if we do it after the fact, and we won\u2019t be able to kill the king without being labeled kingslayers. If you declare independence beforehand, however, this will be a fair war between two kingdoms and we can kill that bastard without having to worry about being called kingslayers.</p><br/><p>The guards Lorist had left at the city gates slowly caught up with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe king is on his way, Your Grace,\u201d announced the guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the royal army been deployed?\u201d asked Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. The king rides with only a small escort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he wants to hold us down while the army deploys and catches up?\u201d guessed Kenmays.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend our family ahead. We\u2019ll following behind them a little slower and see what the king is up to.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group proceeded thusly for several more hours. The king only caught up with them at sunset, covered in sweet and breathing haggardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you leave without a word? I investigated the matter more thoroughly and know you are not to blame for what happened. That brat of mine stepped out of line. You were right to kill his henchmen. I shouldn\u2019t have thought you were insulting me when you killed them. Please, there are only two days left until the ceremony and it wouldn\u2019t do for you to not attend. I was too stressed about the arrangements and let it get the better of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Auguslo dismounted and took hold of Lorist\u2019s reins as he spoke. He begged Lorist to return. The group refused but the king wouldn\u2019t let go of the reins. The two groups were left string at each others for half an hour until Duke Fisablen arrived with the rest of the attending nobles to persuade Lorist to stay.</p><br/><p>Lorist stood firm, however, and the two groups were once again left staring at one another. The standoff continued until midnight, when the last of Lorist\u2019s men returned from the capital to report the army had still shown no signs of mobilizing. Lorist only gave in once he heard the final report. He spoke with his three companions and agreed to return to the capital, but refused to send for their families.</p><br/><p>Auguslo wasn\u2019t very happy that the four dukes weren\u2019t doing exactly as he asked, but he had to let it be, otherwise he\u2019d get nothing. He was even more frustrated when each of the four only brought a hundred guards back with them.</p><br/><p>Everyone could see the immense distrust in Lorist\u2019s eyes and knew an irreparable rift had formed between the four and the king. It was unlikely that the king\u2019s reign would be smooth going forward. A few even wondered if the emperor would live long enough to see his heir take the throne after him, if at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

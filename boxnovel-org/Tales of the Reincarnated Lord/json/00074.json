Sitting in front of him was a hawk-nosed, eagle-eyed man in fully-armored ]knight attire, wearing a breastplate that depicted a black bull\u2019s head. This man was one of the Gold ranked illegitimate sons of the count that was stationed at WIlliamiles Castle. Sitting further away from him was four Silver ranked men in armor. The two at the front were Silver ranked illegitimate sons of the count with other two being garrison squad captains of the castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mentioned that this pike cavalry company you brought over has only been formed 3 days ago, and that you were sent here by my 21st brother?\u201d said the hawk-nosed man as he stared hard at Lorist.</p><br/><p>Lorist made a confused face and said, \u201cThat\u2019s correct. I don\u2019t know the reason myself, but the order I received clearly stated that our company was to make our way to Williamiles Castle to bolster its defense. I myself thought that there was some sort of battle going on here. It seems that our journey here was a complete waste. Oh, and, will you be letting my men into the castle? If not, we\u2019ll have to go back to the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back? Yeah, right. Now that you\u2019re here, you better stay put. What\u2019s your name and Battle Force rank?\u201d snorted the man.</p><br/><p>Lorist nodded and said, \u201cMilord, this one is called Lorist and I\u2019m at the Three Star Iron rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPffft!\u201d A man with a receding hairline started to laugh out loud. \u201cSoldiers nowadays really have no standards\u2026 For a puny Iron rank like you to be able to become a pike cavalry company captain\u2026 It\u2019s a little too unreasonable for us Three Star Silver ranks to only be squad captains of garrison troops\u2026 It truly is ridiculous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c14th brother, I think that 21st brother is just trying to mess with us. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way he would appoint a Three Star Iron ranked captain. We still have to face the allied noble armies on our front. Even though the recent situation has been quite stable, we might be more prone to enemy attacks if there is no pike cavalry stationed here at the castle. That must be why our lord father sent us this newly-formed company to make sure we\u2019ll be well-defended from any potential threat,\u201d said another man who wore a mail armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, 19th brother\u2019s words make sense. Heed my orders, let the pike cavalrymen outside into the castle and order them to gather at the plaza in front. You\u2026 Lok-something, you\u2019re unfit to be the captain of the company, so train hard till you\u2019re a Silver rank first. I will reorganize the pike cavalry in the afternoon, so you will be assigned to be a captain of a garrison troop squad instead,\u201d said that hawk-nosed man.</p><br/><p>Lorist stood there without making a sound as if he was dissatisfied with having his position taken away from him. The hawk-nosed man didn\u2019t bother with it and started discussing with the other men beside him. \u201cWhich one of you will go command the pike cavalry company? Pick two among yourselves and mix some of our own troops into the cavalry company so that we\u2019ll be able to better control the unit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the hawk-nosed man once again looked towards the shivering Tarkel. \u201cOh, aren\u2019t you Tarkel? What\u2019s a coward like you doing in the pike cavalry company? Are you sick of being a prison guard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c8-8th master, thi-this one does not dare to disobey the 21st ma-master\u2026 And he said that an Iron rank li-like me should j-join the cavalry company\u2026 So I got al-allocated here,\u201d stammered Tarkel.</p><br/><p>Tarkel was currently regretting his previous actions a lot. How did he manage to make Lorist take a fancy on him? He wasn\u2019t that much of a talented person and only loved to pay attention to gossip and analyze the situations surrounding them. Now that he had been picked to be Lorist\u2019s personal attendant, he was even brought along to Williamiles Castle to participate in the surprise attack operation.</p><br/><p>The one guarding Williamiles Castle was the 8th illegitimate son of the count, a Two Star Gold rank who not only excelled at combat, but was also a devious and attentive person who was not so easily dealt with. This could be seen from how only a small group including Lorist had been allowed into the castle for verification while the other soldiers they brought had been denied entry and were left outside.</p><br/><p>Of all the people available, you had to pick me to follow you inside! Marksman Josk would\u2019ve been so much more helpful for this purpose! Tarkel really didn\u2019t understand why he was asked to come along. Was it because he had greeted some of his former colleagues outside the castle? Those were his acquaintances and it would only be more suspicious if he didn\u2019t greet them. Lord Norton is also a really careless person. Even though he\u2019s only an Iron rank, he actually came inside the castle with an Iron rank like me! It\u2019s basically suicide for 2 Iron ranks to go up against 1 Gold rank and 4 Silver ranks!</p><br/><p>The more Tarkel thought about it, the more afraid he got. At the moment when the 8th master instructed for Lorist\u2019s men to be allowed into the castle, he feared that they would attack right away and cause their intentions to be discovered and set his demise in stone. When he first entered the great hall, Tarkel tried his best to not utter a voice nor attract any attention to himself. But, just because he coughed once, he was discovered by the 8th master. It was fortunate that he was witty enough to come out with an excuse on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, 21st brother must\u2019ve been drinking a little too much. Then again, Tarkel you coward, are you really that afraid of fighting? If you\u2019re this nervous now, I wonder if you\u2019ll faint when you\u2019re on the battlefield! Hahaha\u2026\u201d laughed the hawk-nosed man out loud.</p><br/><p>Lorist turned his body sideways slightly and looked outside the window of the great hall of the first floor from the corner of his eyes and saw that his men were already making their way into the castle. Good, the gates are already under our control. Right now, Terman is making his way to the two side gates with Yuriy\u2019s light cavalry scout squad making their preparations at the plaza. Josk is also making his way here already.</p><br/><p>The garrison troops of Williamiles Castle were not fully-armed for some reason and only gathered together to watch the spectacle. Maybe they had just finished their lunch and were still slacking off. Some of them were even sunbathing on the side of the walls. This was the perfect opportunity to launch the attack\u2026</p><br/><p>Lorist drew his sword and said, \u201cHe\u2019s afraid because you are all about to die. He\u2019s allergic to corpses, you see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hawk-nosed man was surprised and enraged at the same time. \u201cHow dare you go against a superior officer? Your ambitions must have turned you crazy. For you to actually dare to draw your sword in front of me\u2026 Settle him, make an example of him for the other pike cavalrymen to see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the 8th master was sharp, he actually misunderstood the situation. He thought that Lorist was rebelling because he wasn\u2019t satisfied with being demoted from his position as a company captain.</p><br/><p>Two of the Silver ranked garrison troops rushed over immediately without bothering to draw their swords. One of them thought, hmph, a mere Iron rank\u2026 My hands are enough to subdue him\u2026</p><br/><p>Tarkel instantly crouched on the ground and thought, it\u2019s over. Is Lord Norton insane? Why did an Iron rank like him even draw his sword in front of 1 Gold rank and 4 Silver ranks? It\u2019s like saying, \u2018Please come and kill me!\u2019 He even boasted that they were about to die\u2026 I think the first ones to die will be Iron ranks like me and Lord Norton\u2026 Why couldn\u2019t you wait for your men to arrive first before lashing out? Now you even dragged me into it as well\u2026 Oh my poor wife and precious son\u2026 What would he do without me, his father, beside him?</p><br/><p>Tarkel shut his eyes in despair, only to hear two instances of agonized cries. The first cry slowed into a moan while the other was swift and short. Eh? That didn\u2019t sound right. Why was it two cries instead of one?He then opened his eyes only to be surprised by the scene of Lorist standing unscathed with the first Silver rank that leaped towards him rolling on the ground in pain with both his arms severed and asking for a quick death. He also found that Lorist\u2019s sword had been embedded in the throat of the second Silver ranked squad captain that came after the first.</p><br/><p>The hawk-nosed man and his two brothers jumped up in befuddlement. Nobody would have expected an Iron rank to be able to dispatch two Silver ranked garrison squad captains with only three strikes of the sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the heck are you?\u201d asked the hawk-nosed man as he stared at Lorist intensely while slowly drawing his sword.</p><br/><p>Lorist laughed in a light tone and said, \u201cMy identity doesn\u2019t matter. You only have to know that I\u2019ve come for your lives\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c19th, go sound the alarm! The pike cavalrymen are not on our side! They\u2019re enemies!\u201d shouted the hawk-nosed man to the one dressed in mail armor immediately after his realization.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d he answered as he drew his sword and paced carefully towards the exit and broke into a run.</p><br/><p>An arrow flew over in a flash and pierced through his chest, sending the man flying for three whole meters before he fell back down on the ground and spit out large mouthfuls of blood with both his hands clasped tightly onto the arrow in his chest as if he was trying to pull it out, before he let out his final breath and stopped struggling altogether.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Josk showed up at the door of the great hall with a green longbow in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMarksman Josk\u2026\u201d said the hawk-nosed man in stupor.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong time no see, 8th master\u2026.\u201d said Josk with his bloodshot eyes. The hawk-nosed man, Count Corby\u2019s Gold ranked 8th illegitimate son, also referred by others as the \u20188th master\u2019, was the very person that had attacked Baron Omador\u2019s castle during the wedding and was one of the main perpetrators that had caused the demise of Josk\u2019s loved ones.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold him down!\u201d shouted the hawk-nosed man to the man with a receding hairline as he rushed towards Lorist while drawing an arc in the air with his sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what I needed!\u201d exclaimed Lorist as he raised his sword to meet the incoming blade. The moment the two collided, sharp sounds of metal clashing echoed rapidly throughout the great hall.</p><br/><p>The 8th master had intended to let the half-bald man hold Josk back while he took care of Lorist before moving onto suppressing Josk together with his partner. That way, they would have a better chance to turn the tide of the battle, since Lorist was only an Iron rank. He thought that no matter how good Lorist\u2019s swordsmanship was, it would only allow him to take on Silver ranks at most. Given the 8th master\u2019s Gold ranked Battle Force, he would be able to easily defeat Lorist by brute force alone regardless of the level of swordsmanship given the disparity of raw power between their ranks.</p><br/><p>That was the 8th master\u2019s first mistake. Never in his wildest dreams would he expect that the moment he first crossed blades with Lorist, his Battle Force felt like it didn\u2019t have any effect at all, causing a Gold rank like him to stagger backwards against a supposed Iron rank and even almost getting slashed. Even the half-bald man who was busy with Josk stared dumbstruck at the result of the first clash.</p><br/><p>Tarkel was looking at the fight with his mouth wide agape with saliva leaking out of it, making him seem like a dumb idiot. So Lord Norton wasn\u2019t insane and was confident in his abilities all along! This swordsmanship is truly godly\u2026 So much so that he is able to hold back a Two Star Gold Swordsman like the 8th master to the point where he had no choice but to be on the defensive!</p><br/><p>The half-bald man snapped out of his stupor and noticed that Josk was still entranced by the battle between Lorist and his stepbrother. Extremely delighted, he carefully inched backwards and intended to escape. This was the 8th master\u2019s second mistake: he overestimated his subordinates\u2019 loyalty to him.</p><br/><p>As a stellar marksman, Josk had noticed the half-bald man\u2019s slight movement immediately. He quickly held his green bow up, stretched it wide like a full moon and unleashed three arrows in quick succession.</p><br/><p>The first arrow had been blocked by that man, but it took him a lot of effort to do so and he had retreated 3 steps backward as a result. The second arrow broke that man\u2019s sword into two and caused the man to cough out some blood. By the time the third and final arrow arrived, the baldy had already lost all his power to resist and could only stare at the arrow expand within his field of view until it inevitably entered his mouth and lifted him into the air, nailing him onto the wall nearby behind.</p><br/><p>Having witnessed the death of the middle-aged man, the 8th master started to panic. He already had his hands full with fighting Lorist. Now that Josk had taken care of that half-bald man and had started aiming his bow towards him, the 8th master started to feel even more nervous. In his disturbed mental state, his hands missed a beat and allowed Lorist the opportunity to inflict the final blow. With a flash of a blade, the savage looking 8th master let out a pained grunt before his head separated from his body and flew through the air. Lorist backed off quickly to avoid the fountain of blood that had erupted from the stump of the man\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long are you going to stay flat on the ground like that, Tarkel? Quickly get up and hang these heads on the veranda and announce to the soldiers that Geldos City is already under our control,\u201d instructed Lorist.</p><br/><p>By the time the five heads were put on display at the first floor veranda, the whole castle broke into a panic that was quickly suppressed. That was especially the case after 7 or 8 soldiers who were dead loyal to the count started to fight back against the pike cavalrymen entering the castle, only to be shot to death with one arrow each by Josk, further accelerating the surrender of the castle\u2019s garrison troops. By the time evening came, Lorist\u2019s men had already taken full control of Williamiles Castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuriy, after resting for one hour after dinner, I\u2019m going to bring Terman\u2019s knight squad and Knight Josk back to Geldos City. I will leave Williamiles Castle in your care. Make sure you let your light cavalry scouts patrol the surrounding area from time to time, but don\u2019t attack the surrounding allied noble armies unless they initiate the attack, in which case you may retaliate. Tarkel, stay here and placate the garrison troops\u2019 mental state and tell them that by the time the soldiers that are coming to take their place to guard the castle arrives, they will be allowed to go back to Geldos City to check on their family members. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t take too long. I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ll be able to send a messenger over within ten days,\u201d said Lorist as he bit into a piece of bread in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilord, I understand. Please leave the place to me,\u201d said Yuriy before he continued his meal.</p><br/><p>Tarkel placed the piece of bone in his hand onto his plate, rubbed his mouth with his sleeve and said, \u201cMilord, as long as I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll ensure that the garrison troops don\u2019t cause any trouble.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Lorist couldn\u2019t help but wonder why the plaza would be so crowded at a time like this. What was going on there?</p><br/><p>By the time Lorist arrived at the plaza, the sound of chatter rose audibly.</p><br/><p>\u201cInstructor Locke is here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Norton Lorist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere? Which one of them is him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat one. That\u2019s Instructor Locke\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist emerged from the crowd of people.</p><br/><p>A rough looking man with a bearded face wearing an old leather armor ran towards him while unsheathing his two-handed greatsword. Raising his blade high, he roared, \u201cAha, Lorist! I\u2019m here to request a duel with you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two-handed sword emitted a glowing light that signified his power as a Two Star Silver Swordsman.</p><br/><p>Different Battle Force ranks were easily distinguished. Bronze Battle Force gave one a slightly buffed look and greatly increased one\u2019s strength, agility and endurance when it circulated through one\u2019s body. Iron Battle Force mainly focused on the protection of the body. For example, it can be used to fortify the hands, causing them to radiate a faint glow and have the toughness of iron, greatly increasing their defensive capabilities multiple times more than that of an average person\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Silver ranked Battle Force excelled at the attacking aspect. Silver Swordsmen can project their Battle Force onto their weapons and make them emit various forms of sword glows, with the length of the glow indicating the Star rank of the swordsman.</p><br/><p>As for Gold Swordsmen, they can gather their Battle Force to execute ranged attacks. Beyond that was the level of Blademasters, who could project their Battle Force onto anything from flowers to blades of grass and use them as invincible divine weapons to eradicate their enemies.</p><br/><p>Sword Saints, however, were more like legends. Not much was known about them, though it was said that they can utilize something along the lines of a \u201cdomain\u201d. There were only about four or five known Sword Saints on the Grindia continent. Nations which had the backing of a Saint had incredibly stable foundations. That\u2019s why these Sword Saints were kept hidden from the masses and were shrouded in mystery and enigma.</p><br/><p>Lorist looked at that man holding the raised greatsword with a look of admiration. That guy must have quite a few gold coins to spare for him to dare to draw his sword like this in the academy, he thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d A loud cry rang out as a troop of black uniformed swordsmen marched towards the plaza.</p><br/><p>Sword glows pointed at his throat, lower torso and chest, the brutish man stood still without moving an inch. The scary part was that two of the sword glows that were pointed at him were much longer than his own. The owners of those swords were definitely Three Star Silver Swordsmen.</p><br/><p>The few other men who came with the brutish man hurriedly attempted to hide their weapons.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you, you, and you, the one wearing a chainmail, yes you! And that other one in the blue clothes! And that one wearing the leather hat! You guys are really brave\u2026 For you to even dare to unsheathe your weapons in the academy! Bring them to the Enforcement Department!\u201d A fat man appeared before the men and shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>Those who were named by the fat man attempted to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to run from me!? You guys, apprehend them and double their fines!\u201d said the fatty with a cruel expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir!\u201d said the black robed men as they made the chase.</p><br/><p>If the students of the academy were asked to name one most wretched people in the academy, that person would definitely be that fat man who was also the head of the Enforcement Department. His name was Charade and was called by many as the \u201cDeathly Miser\u201d.</p><br/><p>As the head of the Enforcement Department of the academy, Charade never scolded or physically punished the transgressing students. Instead, he gave them a very huge fine. If the students couldn\u2019t pay up, the department has got just the solution for them. The Enforcement Department provides loans for the fined students. And to make sure they repaid their loans, the department also found jobs for them and made them work until their debts and interests were paid up in full.</p><br/><p>Once, there were two students who broke the rules and did not have the money to pay the fine. The fatty merely smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money. As long as you can work, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without delay, they were sent to the mines for three whole months. It was also rumored that they almost got sodomized there. After the three month term, the fatty called for someone to go bring them back. A tear-jerking scene soon unfolded: the two students knelt and desperately hugged the ones who were sent to pick them up, refusing to let go.</p><br/><p>After the black robed men apprehended the ones who tried to escape, the fatty walked towards the one who brandished the greatsword leisurely. He motioned for him to sheathe his sword, which the man soon did with much haste.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you come to the academy to rob and kill?\u201d asked the fatty with a \u201ccourteous\u201d, wanting tone.</p><br/><p>The burly man replied with a flustered look, \u201cUmm, no-nope. I came here after seeing the notice issued by the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNotice? What kind of notice allowed you to come terrorize our students? I don\u2019t ever recall seeing anything like that,\u201d said the fatty with an expression of intense curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the man let out a startled cry. \u201cIt\u2019s that duel notice that you guys put up! It says that any Silver rank contestant who can defeat the Black Iron Gold-ranked Instructor Locke gets to take his place as gold-ranked instructor and will be rewarded a hundred gold coins! That\u2019s the reason I came\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s that notice. That\u2019s right, the academy did put up something like this. But, are you sure you checked it out properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I did! The words on that notice were larger than my fists! How could I have missed anything?\u201d roared the burly man loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Tell me the fine print on the notice! It was never stated that you could come in randomly and just pull your sword out in public!\u201d shouted the fatty, whose expression had suddenly turned dark, glaring at the burly man.</p><br/><p>That man winked and coughed out, \u201cI was just worried that someone would beat me to Lorist! I didn\u2019t see no fine print!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was stated very clearly on the notice. Didn\u2019t you say that you had read it carefully?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean those words that were smaller than my fingernails? That was the fine print? Who reads those? I only read the words at the top\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s voice grew softer and softer. He looked like he just realized his grave error.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you think the academy would just let anyone barge in like that with a sword in hand? Of course there were terms and conditions! We at the Dawn Academy are the elites of the Grindia Continent. Everything we do has to follow strict protocol. It is stated that any Silver ranked individual who wished to challenge Lorist was to report to the Enforcement Department. You see that white stone building over there? That\u2019s the Enforcement Department! You must go there and apply for a duel and pay a registration fee of ten gold Fordes. After that, we will notify you the time and place for the duel within two or three days. If you don\u2019t show up at that time, it will be considered your loss by default and we will not return your registration fee.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t profit if you don\u2019t invest. It might cost you ten gold Fordes, but think about it: your opponent Lorist is but an Iron ranked swordsman with somewhat better swordsmanship. If you had won, not only would you get a hundred gold Fordes, you will also be employed by the academy as a gold-ranked sword instructor! A gold-ranked instructor\u2019s salary is ten gold Fordes a month. You can easily buy a house in this city and settle down here with that kind of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade talked like a patient salesman with the brawny man nodding to every one of the points Charade made.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame\u2026\u201d said Charade with his expression turning glum as his tone changed. \u201cYou actually ruined such a good chance by not reading the notice carefully and committed such an act at our academy. Not only have you broken the rules of our academy, you have also greatly insulted the academy and caused deep mental anguish in our students! That\u2019s why, you must be punished before you will be allowed to register for a duel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPunishment? What kind of punishment?\u201d asked the brawny man, scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. According to our academy\u2019s rules, we will not cause you any physical harm. We only ask you to pay a small fine. This matter will be settled if you hand over five gold Fordes,\u201d said Charade with a pleasant smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Five gold coins?\u201d The brawny man could never imagine having to lose five gold coins just for drawing his blade. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t have that kind of money\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfectly okay. You can borrow it from some friends. If you can\u2019t do even that, the Enforcement Department can find you some work which will guarantee the repayment of your debt.\u201d The fatty got a little impatient after hearing the man\u2019s reply. He waved for the men in black to bring the transgressing men back to the Enforcement Department.</p><br/><p>By the time this ended, only half the people who were at the plaza remained.</p><br/><p>Lorist turned to look at Charade with a grim expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeathly Miser! What are you up to this time!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fatty replied with a face full of smiles, \u201cHaha, isn\u2019t this brother Locke? It\u2019s so nice to see you again! I\u2019ve missed you so very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the crap. What\u2019s with that notice you guys put up?\u201d Lorist said while glaring at Charade.</p><br/><p>The fatty let out a long sigh and said, \u201cBrother, weren\u2019t you troubled by the constant challenges you received from people last year? Didn\u2019t I come out with a solution to that problem that also profited us both by charging anyone who wanted a duel with you for five gold coins, from which I took two and the rest went to you? Us brothers earned quite a bit after 57 duels last year. However, that old bastard took note of our little business\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade pointed at the sky, hinting at the pressure from his higher ups. \u201cJust two days ago the old bastard came looking for me and told me that you still didn\u2019t manage to break through during your excursion at the Relic Islands. The other academies mocked that of all the people in Dawn Academy, you, a Three Star Iron Swordsman, was appointed a dual gold ranked instructor. To teach those people a lesson, we decided to put up that notice, mainly to attract the Silver Swordsmen from other academies to challenge you and see for themselves your ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that all it is?\u201d Lorist didn\u2019t believe for one moment that that was all it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026\u2026\u201d the fatty hesitated. \u201cAnd, we also wanted to earn some money from this. The old bastard said that I didn\u2019t think far enough and that I was satisfied with only just a little over a hundred gold coins. He thought that if we offered a tempting gold reward, it would attract even more people, even if we raised the dueling fee by two times. Of course, the old guy said that since you\u2019re the one doing most of the work, you\u2019ll still receive your cut of three gold coins per duel. The enforcement division\u2019s share got cut to only one gold coin per duel for arranging the dueling location and maintaining security during the duel. The rest of the money will go to the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist understood that the \u201cold bastard\u201d referred to by Charade was no other than Academy Head Levins. \u201cThe old guy isn\u2019t afraid that I\u2019ll lose a match?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d laughed the fatty, \u201cI myself trust you wholeheartedly. Even though I\u2019m a Three Star Silver Swordsman, I know full well that I will not last more than twenty bouts should I battle with you. Based on your 57 wins last year, we at the Enforcement Division don\u2019t doubt you one bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I find it weird that the old bastard has so much faith in you that he set the reward prize so high. Oh, did you spar with Instructor Claude during your trip to the islands? I heard you took more than 200 moves from him without losing. Is that true?\u201d said the fatty as he recalled the rumor.</p><br/><p>Instructor Kellen Claude was a Three Star Gold Swordsman and was heralded by most as a person who would one day break into the Blademaster level. He was the chief swordsmanship instructor and was the only other person in the academy other than Lorist who had a gold swordsmanship instructor badge. He got it because of his skill while Lorist got his by winning 30 straight duels against opponents of a higher Battle Force rank than him. Additionally, Lorist would lose his appointment as a gold ranked swordsmanship instructor if he loses even one duel.</p><br/><p>Instructor Claude already wanted to spar with Lorist ever since he heard of Lorist\u2019s 57 wins. However, he was hesitant to do so as his Battle Force rank was far beyond that of Lorist. The expedition to the Relic Islands, however, presented itself to be an opportunity for him to spar with Lorist. The excuse was that Lorist\u2019s aptitude had to be assessed to determine whether he was fit to attend the expedition.</p><br/><p>Lorist endured more than 200 moves and finally lost due to the sheer difference in Battle Force power, which was already an amazing feat in itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d asked Lorist, as there were only three people present during that duel.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old bastard himself told me,\u201d exposed Charade without blinking an eye. \u201cHe said that even though he wasn\u2019t well versed in the matters of Battle Force or swordsmanship, Instructor Claude\u2019s high evaluation on your abilities, which included your undefeatable status among Silver Swordsmen and your swordsmanship that far surpasses most Gold Swordsmen made the old bastard very confident in you, so much so that he\u2019s willing to bet such a large amount of money on you. Ever since his duel with you, Instructor Claude has also entered seclusion training to attempt to break through to the Blademaster level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026\u201d Lorist was speechless. Just like that, he was swept into this money-making scheme by the academy head right after returning, causing him to feel incredibly annoyed. \u201cI\u2019m going straight to meet that old bastard!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

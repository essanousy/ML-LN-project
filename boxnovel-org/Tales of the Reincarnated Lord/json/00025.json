It was also in the area between the Dwarven Kingdom and the Forde Trade Union. According to the old legends, the remaining magi at the end times of the magic civilization opened a dimensional portal and sent the other sentient beings on the Grindia Continent to different worlds to ensure that the humans would survive the oncoming tribulations and wouldn\u2019t have to compete with the other races. For some reason, however, they missed out the dwarves who had been living around the Tedanini Mountains and slowly, with the passing of two thousand or so years, they had built up their very own kingdom.</p><br/><p>Currently, this was the only other sentient being on the Grindia Continent apart from the humans. Given the tendency for the dwarves to reside within mountain ranges, however, they rarely had any conflict with the humans and was even on trading terms.</p><br/><p>While the Calisto Mountains was technically in the territory of the Forde Trade Union, the union didn\u2019t hold much governing power in the area. Given the nature of the battle-crazed mountain folk, the trade union treaded carefully and was careful not to offend them in the slightest, lest a large scale conflict erupts. At the moment, the council was considering splitting the Calisto Mountains into several districts in the future and letting those who had contributed to the union govern it.</p><br/><p>After three days and two nights of travel, Lorist and gang finally arrived at their destination, Baca Village. The middle-aged village chief who was also the requestor and the owner of the mines, Bam, welcomed them.</p><br/><p>Bam was also one of Lorist\u2019s senior students in the academy. With his father having enlisted in the trade union army to fend off the Krissen Empire\u2019s invasion, he retired to the village due to his injuries and resolved himself to make the village prosper after seeing all the progress that is being made at the outside world and barely managed to send Bam to the Dawn Academy. Bam took up two additional professional courses, namely, resource foraging and mine management. However, given that those courses were rather unpopular and the quality of the lecturers were subpar, he only managed to learn those things in theory and never got any practical experience. The academy subsequently discontinued those courses.</p><br/><p>After returning to the village, Bam spent five to six years cultivating the skills he had learned and managed to discover several veins of silver and tin ore at a hill near the village. While the excavation amount wasn\u2019t humongous, it was enough to support the livelihood of six other villages around it. The discovery of the mines wiped out poverty and famine from the surrounding villages. Additionally, Bam also used a part of the profit from the ore mines to fund several talented youngsters to go to Morante City for further studies.</p><br/><p>The whole gang felt that Senior Bam was pretty impressive for his willingness to forsake the possibility of a grand lifestyle in Morante City for the sake of developing his village and community. Yuriy and Lorist were most impressed with how he used the extra money to sponsor the village youths as they understood that the costs of studying at Morante City wasn\u2019t cheap.</p><br/><p>Very frankly, Bam told them about how he first encountered traces of Metal-eater Rats within the vicinity of the mines. Being an Iron ranked swordsman, he formed a group to go take care of the pests. It was not until a while later that they discovered that the infestation wasn\u2019t as simple as they had thought and over the past year, they had killed more than ten of those rats on multiple occasions already. Just two months ago, an attack by a swarm of Metal-eater Rats had killed three and injured five of the miners. That was when he finally decided to end it once and for all and summoned all the villagers who had Battle Force to go on an extermination mission down the mines; including Bam, there were three Iron ranked fighters and eleven Bronze ranked fighters in total.</p><br/><p>However, the extermination did not succeed as the swarm of rats numbered more than a hundred and the party of 14 were hard-pressed and not one of them escaped unscathed. Even though they managed to wipe out 30 or so rats, they had struggled to retreat under the relentless attacks of the rat swarm and nine of them ended up with rather severe injuries.</p><br/><p>Since that failed attempt, Bam understood the magnitude of the problem and had no choice but to seek aid from mercenaries. After treating all of those who had been injured, the village was only left with less than 30 gold coins and their dire financial straits was further exacerbated by the temporary closing of the mines. Being only able to offer ten or so gold coins as a mission reward, and given the referral fee of five gold coins charged by the mercenary guild, most mercenaries were hesitant on taking the mission up.</p><br/><p>Recalling that the students of the Dawn Academy often went on mercenary missions, he reached out to the villagers who were studying there and managed to get in contact with Charade.</p><br/><p>Having listened to Bam\u2019s description of the situation, the party was convinced that this mission had relatively low risk asBam was a rather credible person. Charade went on to brief the rest of them about the situation: there was an estimated amount of two to three hundred Metal-eater Rats. With their forces of three Silver ranks and two Iron ranks, even if they couldn\u2019t wipe out all of the rats, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for them to take out the rat queen and cause the rats to leave the mines.</p><br/><p>While a reward of 18 gold coins for the rat extermination was a little lacking, it was already rather favorable for Charade\u2019s party as Bam would also be bringing along two other Bronze Swordsmen to guide them in the mines as well as manage their equipment for no extra charge. The most lucrative point of the mission was that any loot or gains obtained during it belonged solely to the party. There might be a possibility of finding gold nuggets and other rare metals in the rat nests which could be sold for quite a sum. The party decided to rest up for the day before setting out tomorrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile the meat of the Metal-eater Rat is a little sour, it is undoubtedly safe to consume and would taste even better if they were made into jerky. The organs and blood of the rat, however, had to be removed completely as high concentrations of toxic minerals resided within them. The rats\u2019 most threatening feature are their front teeth which are really durable and can be sold for one small silver each on the market. Their pelt however was worthless as it had a distinct foul smell that attracted insects which couldn\u2019t be removed no matter how it was treated, so they are normally discarded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Within the mines, Els was assigned the role of the scout and vanguard while Charade, Yuriy and Terman were positioned in the middle and Lorist, Bam and the other two swordsmen constituted the rearguard. At the moment, Lorist was telling Bam what he had learned about the rats from the magical beast biology lessons.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Metal-eater Rats hate the smell of pine trees, especially that of their roots. The concoction we sprayed around the entrance was to limit the range of activity of the rats and prevent them from running all over the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was the result of the research that was completed last year by Professor Snade Borg of our magical beast biology department. He was even rewarded 20000 gold Fordes for this. As long as you apply this pesticide on a regular basis at the mine entrance, you would be free from Metal-eater Rat infestations.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo top that off, it\u2019s not that expensive at all. A large bucket of it only costs about 3 gold Fordes and can last for as long as a month. After using this for a year or two, a natural pine smell will form around the mines and you won\u2019t have to use it any longer. Senior Bam, please consider this quickly as we have a limited supply. You can only get these from academy insiders so please feel free to make your order with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist was really enthusiastic about promoting the pesticide as he stood to gain one gold Forde for every bucket sold. If he managed to sell 12 buckets per year, that would mean an extra 12 gold Fordes of income for him annually without breaking a sweat.</p><br/><p>As they descended further into the mines, they wiped out two waves of rats along the way, which numbered up to more or less 200 of them. The performance and efficacy of the team greatly impressed Bam and the Bronze Swordsmen that followed along.</p><br/><p>With Charade, Els and Terman standing at three points around him with him in the middle, Yuriy proved to be quite capable at supporting the team and allowed the rest to slaughter the rats without worry. Lorist himself was even more amazing; he moved separately from the rest of them and easily took care of as many rats as those in the formation himself without getting even a single bloodstain on him.</p><br/><p>Senior Bam and his attendants were embarrassed at the fact that nine out of their group of fourteen had incurred severe injuries on their previous extermination attempt after seeing how Lorist\u2019s group killed the rats easily and effortlessly, as if it were just a common training exercise.</p><br/><p>After killing off the remaining rats in the second wave, the party decided to rest for a while as they removed the valuable parts of the rat that could be sold for money. Yuriy took out a large plier and used it to pluck the front teeth of all the rats. Having been told by Lorist that the meat of the rats was edible, Bam requested the group to give the meat to them to help alleviate the food shortage problem in their village.</p><br/><p>Having rested up and eaten some dry rations, Charade instructed the group to split up and led Terman and Yuriy into the left cavern while Lorist and Els headed for the right one. Given that most of the rats had been exterminated, all that was left was to take care of the rat queen.</p><br/><p>Slinging the bag filled with rat teeth on his back, Lorist casually smeared some of the pesticide on the walls of the cavern as he walked along the path.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d Els asked.</p><br/><p>Lorist responded by telling Els about the effects of the pesticide half-heartedly given that Els would not be interested in purchasing any of it from him anyway. Els doubted the efficacy of the pesticide however and they broke into an argument.</p><br/><p>Having walked for quite some time and reaching the end of the road, they didn\u2019t discover anymore rats. Els said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back. There\u2019s no point in remaining here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he finished his words, the rock wall in front of him suddenly jolted and cracked open with a loud sound. A head of a large beast emerged from the hole in the wall, sniffed the air around it and leaped in Lorist and Els\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that!?\u201d exclaimed Lorist in shock as he dropped the torch in his hand. \u201cIsn\u2019t this fellow a little too big? The head itself has a diameter of two meters!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBetter run!\u201d said Els loudly as he grabbed Lorist\u2019s arm and turned to run the other direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cSol, I knew that bringing you along was a bad call! The last two times were bad enough. For the whole of this mission, I\u2019ve been worried that something terrible would happen. I can finally stop guessing, now that this critter has shown up in the middle of the rat extermination mission\u2026\u201d called Lorist as he ran behind Els.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even thanked me for saving you yet! If I were a little bit late, you would\u2019ve been swallowed whole by now! You even dropped our torch!\u201d replied Els.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was suddenly reminded of the Single-horned Rock Python that was said to live in the mines. That thing back there definitely had a long body and a really large head! If that isn\u2019t the python, I don\u2019t know what is!\u201d said Lorist, slightly embarrassed at the fact that he had indeed been saved by Els\u2019s quick thinking.</p><br/><p>Els turned his head to the back before saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a Single-horned Rock Python to me. It has a round head and doesn\u2019t seem to have any scales or eyes. Its speed isn\u2019t that fast either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you see in this darkness? Do I look like a child that would fall for your lies? And hey, don\u2019t run so quickly! What if we run straight into a wall!?\u201d shouted Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Els laughed lightly. \u201cYou know that I train in a darkness attribute Battle Force, right? I bet you didn\u2019t know that people who trained in that type of Battle Force had night vision. I can see just as good in the darkness as I do in broad daylight! That\u2019s my special ability! How is it? Are you envious? I can still see so well even without the torch you dropped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood Sol, I have enough money to buy all the torches I need. I don\u2019t need that stinking ability!\u201d Feeling rather envious, Lorist thought, This guy\u2019s ability of being able to see in the dark is not at all inferior to my own dynamic vision\u2026 And it\u2019s extremely helpful in poorly-lit environments\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I bet you were enjoying the sights in the bath on that day. Even though the lighting is pretty bad in there, I bet you could see all of them with perfect clarity given your ability,\u201d said Lorist as he panted heavily.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you please not bring that up again? I was facing the wall at that time and couldn\u2019t see even one of them\u2026\u201d Just as Lorist reminded him of that incident, Els recalled the cruel and demeaning remark by that girl that deeply wounded his pride and tripped on a piece of rock as he lost focus.</p><br/><p>Lorist swiftly helped Els to his feet. \u201cEh? Locke, are you hurt? Why\u2019re your clothes wet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stunned, Lorist felt his body up and said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s not blood. The waterskin holding the pesticide burst and released all of its contents on my body. That fall didn\u2019t hurt you badly, right? We better hurry, I\u2019m starting to hear that thing closing in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a short while, they went back to their previous resting place where Charade and the rest were waiting. Seeing Lorist and Els\u2019s haggard looks, they broke into a stream of laughter until they heard the rumbling coming from the tunnel behind them and started running towards the cavern exit for their lives.</p><br/><p>Despite having a stocky build, Charade was the fastest of them all and escaped the caverns and was followed by Yuriy, Terman, Bam and one of the Bronze Swordsmen with Lorist and Els trailing along at the end. The other Bronze ranked helper who was packing the rat carcasses onto the cart outside the mines looked at their panicked expressions with wonder. What had happened in the mines while he was away?</p><br/><p>Charade screamed, \u201cGet out of the way! A magical beast is coming out from the entrance!\u201d</p><br/><p>That instantly set the rest of the group into panic. Fortunately, the beast retreated into the mines as if it was afraid of the strong sunlight.</p><br/><p>Letting out a relieved breath, Charade asked Lorist and Els what happened. \u201cWhat was that? How did you end up encountering it? And, what\u2019s that smell on you, Locke? Did your bladder go loose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist explained, \u201cNo, the pesticide got splashed all over my body. It\u2019s the one developed by professor Snade Borg. I brought some over cause I heard that we would be eradicating Metal-eater Rats.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood Sol! Let me take a look at that pesticide! I think I know what that monster back there is!\u201d said Charade as he walked towards Lorist angrily, seemingly wanting to give him a punch or two.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, what\u2019s wrong? Wasn\u2019t it a good idea to bring along the pesticide for the Metal-eater Rats?\u201d asked Lorist as he dodged the fatty\u2019s punches.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood idea my ass! While that concoction can indeed repel Metal-eater Rats, it would also attract Ground Wyrms! That thing back there was a Ground Wyrm that had been lured over by the smell of that pesticide!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even know how serious that was? Ground Wyrms are magically mutated versions of common earthworms and they are attracted to the smell of pine tree roots! If you don\u2019t believe me, try digging out the roots of a pine tree and see if you find a nest of earthworms there! There are even people in the academy who are using that \u2018pesticide\u2019 of yours as Ground Wyrm lure!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat professor even lost the 20000 gold Fordes that had been awarded to him after they found out about the unintended effect and caused lots of leftover pesticide to be stocked up at the academy, didn\u2019t you know? Sol, only an idiot like you would fall for his schemes!\u201d screamed Charade with all his breath.</p><br/><p>Good Sol, no wonder that professor said that he would give me one gold coin for every bucket sold! So, it was a defective product! Holding his head and curling up on the ground, Lorist merely said, \u201cAll of you guys, please hit me to your hearts\u2019 content. I deserve this.\u201d</p><br/><p>But nobody went over to beat him up and merely calmed down to figure out how they would solve the problem at hand. Relative to other magical beasts, the Ground Wyrm wasn\u2019t too hard to take care of. They decided to lure it out with a large hook and rope after some discussion.</p><br/><p>The Ground Wyrm was essentially an oversized earthworm; it was aversive to sunlight and water and was considered relatively harmless to most other magical beasts. It didn\u2019t pose that much of a threat to small, agile targets given its large, imposing body and slow speed. Charade and his party spent six whole days with the cooperation of the Baca villagers to put together a hundred meter long rope with a large hook at its end and sent Lorist down the mine with the hook to atone for his grave mistake.</p><br/><p>Before he left, Els walked over from the crowd. Lorist asked, \u201cAre you gonna do it for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to accompany you down there. If Yuriy and Terman wasn\u2019t assigned to hold the rope by Charade, they would\u2019ve accompanied you as well. After all, we\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was at that moment when Lorist was moved to tears.</p><br/><p>They put the hook down after walking a certain distance into the mines and wrapped it with a bundle of cloth that was soaked in the \u2018pesticide\u2019. Without much delay, a rumbling sound could be heard from the depths of the caverns and the both of them ran out of it at full speed.</p><br/><p>On their way to the exit, the rope snapped upward tightly. Lorist said cheerfully, \u201cIt got hooked!\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the mines, Charade was directing the villagers to pull on the rope with all their force. Even after busting their backs for the whole afternoon, the Ground Wyrm simply refused to come out. After a final heave, the people present witnessed blood splatter out of the entrance of the mines as the internals of the Ground Wyrm were pulled out of its carcass.</p><br/><p>Looking at the scene with a hint of satisfaction, Charade said, \u201cNot bad, given how its internals were pulled out, that Ground Wyrm\u2019s dead for sure. We\u2019ll go harvest its skin tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Given the amazing regenerative capabilities of Ground Wyrms, the only viable method of getting rid of it was to use a hook to pull the internals out. While the rest of the beast wasn\u2019t worth much, its skin could be boiled to extract a strong adhesive which could be mixed with sand to form sturdy building material.</p><br/><p>To further make up for Lorist\u2019s error, Charade gave the skin to Bam, much to his delight, as he would be able to make new houses for his villagers with the skin of the Ground Wyrm.</p><br/><p>After spending another three days clearing out the mines of any remaining Metal-eater Rats, the party put one of the small cages they brought around the entrance of the mines and with a rat corpse inside it. The decaying corpse would serve as an effective repellant for other Metal-eater Rats and keep them away from the mines.</p><br/><p>Having wrapped up the whole affair, the gang bade farewell to Senior Bam and started their journey back to the city.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

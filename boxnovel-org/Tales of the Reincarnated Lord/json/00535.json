Perhaps the south\u2019s private traders know this will be their last chance for the year. Either way, they\u2019ve been buying like crazy, even our luxury products have grown wings. We\u2019ve made three million\u2019s profit in these two months alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 400 thousand units of magic beast fur winter clothing sold out in fifteen days. Morantians were scrambling to buy them. The only thing is, the local tailors have been complaining. They\u2019re dissatisfied that we\u2019d make bland winter clothing with magic beast fur. They\u2019ve had to painstakingly remake the clothes to be at least somewhat decent. They want us to give them the loose fur itself next time and let them make clothes from scratch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spiel\u2019s face was positively glowing. He was the picture of bliss. He finally understood why Lorist insisted on investing in Morante. Other things aside, almost 60 percent of all their goods and materials were already sold. Three million had been made from daily necessities, and a further two million from more luxury items. Five million all-in-all in just two months.</p><br/><p>And that was just in trade. They\u2019d also been reaping benefits in industries as well. All their workshops were at full capacity and a few had even switched to 24 hour operations to keep up with demand. This investment\u2019s knock-on effects were reaching all the way back to the Northlands. Next year would see him collecting a lot more in taxes as well.</p><br/><p>Lorist didn\u2019t have much to say. He had instructed Spiel to monitor the goods prices so a single bad apple didn\u2019t ruin the whole batch. He had also prepared to build new factories to keep up had introduced new regulations for entry to the market to steer clear of over supplying.</p><br/><p>All the necessary arrangements made, Spiel left.</p><br/><p>Senbaud was next. He\u2019d come to bid his farewells before he left with for Jigda with the convoy. It carried the first shipment in Lorist\u2019s deal with his former lover. He did not expect to be back before the middle of the next year, but he hoped to return with products and good news from their new market in the south.</p><br/><p>The southern seas had relatively good weather, but was rife with pirates. Half of his trip was to escort the convoy, the other half was to begin cleaning out the region. He would be accompanied by 11 Blitzes, besides his flagship, and a hundred Dams. This would be the first time a Norton ship crossed into the southern seas.</p><br/><p>Charade was next. Sylvia interrupted their meeting by storming in unceremoniously. She had two pieces of good news. First was that Lorist\u2019s youngest children had been born. Maria had birthed a son on the 21st of the 10th back in the north, and Dilianna a girl on the 27th.</p><br/><p>Lorist\u2019s family was becoming almost cumbersomely large. He now had three sons and three daughters, his dead bastard and the boy\u2019s abandoned younger brother, and the other unregistered children -- Arriotoli\u2019s two children, excluded. He had single-handedly turned around his family\u2019s slow decline. The only disappointment was that all but one of his children were legitimised bastards, and were thus, at best, half-Norton. So, while he had reversed his family\u2019s decline, he had only partially restored the bloodline. He had to have more legitimate children, children with Sylvia, to truly right his family\u2019s fortunes. Regardless, this was something worth celebrating. He finished two bottles of fine wine with Charade.</p><br/><p>Charade was there to discuss Mass and Gypsy\u2019s agriculture. Thirty thousand households, 140 thousand Morantians, used cash or loans to buy the farmland. Half was profit. Together with the loan the government had secured from Lorist, they now had all the money they needed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve asked for help expanding the military even further. They want to form four more divisions, two for Morante and one for Callisto Hills and Einiba each, and several cavalry divisions,\u201d explained Charade.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they being too hasty?\u201d Lorist asked, \u201cEveryone knows Einiba is a wreck. Didn\u2019t Loze complain his men were being used to help build new homes for the city\u2019s inhabitants and to get them supplies? It hardly seems worth a division.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why they want to send a division there. They want to officiate their declaration of independence next year. You know the old Union will respond in force. They cannot allow this to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat said, they don\u2019t have the forces to attack everything the new Union controls, so they\u2019ll focus on the strategically important targets, which is neither Callisto Hills, nor Einiba. Those buggers plan to put us on the plains, where the old Union will no doubt strike first and most aggressively, and sequester themselves in the unimportant places, Callisto Hills and Einiba.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell them there is no need for a further expansion. As long as I\u2019m still present, everyone will focus their attention on me, and since I\u2019m too powerful for them to face head-on, they won\u2019t attack in force.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe windstorm swordsaint. The old Union is waiting for him to recover. They won\u2019t attack until he is ready to keep me busy again. I suspect he\u2019ll challenge me to a duel sometime late next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>The plains\u2019 cities were now held by just a few new Union divisions. Lorist\u2019s Firmrock had returned home, and Tigersoar was in Callisto Hills. There was no way the Trade Union did not know his current disposition. They quite possible already knew of the Free Union. His men had killed all the spies they\u2019d sent, but they had occupied the city for decades, they could not be so easily cut out of the city.</p><br/><p>If they really knew about everything, but had yet to respond, it could only be that they were waiting for their swordsaint to recover. They needed a counter to Lorist, they would attack the moment they had it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see... So once again, Your Grace is the key to our victory or defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, My duel is unimportant. The windstorm swordsaint can keep me busy, but he cannot defeat me. Which means the deciding factor will be our two armies. All the windstorm swordsaint can do for the old Union is assuage their concerns that I will go on a rampage and wipe their army out. He cannot win victory for them, that they have to do on their own. The same goes for us. In this upcoming war, I can only keep their swordsaint from rampaging, you must claw victory from the old Union yourselves. With us out of the picture, the next most powerful people, the blademasters, will be the greatest deciding factor. No matter how strong our ranged weapons, they will struggle against dozens of blademasters.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s the problem! If they entrenched themselves, they could fight off the rank-and-file soldiers, but they\u2019d be vulnerable to teams of blademasters striking from the shadows, and the Trade Union was certain to do this, they\u2019d already used this tactic to great effect during the War of Glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew we shouldn\u2019t have let them ransom the blademasters and gold ranks,\u201d complained Charade.</p><br/><p>House Norton had barely 20 gold-ranked knights. Apart from the initial 16, only Patt and Pete had joined their ranks. Even if one was to count Glacia and Sylvia, they had twenty, but Lorist would never let his wife take the field, nor, he suspected, would any of the generals. And they could only truly count on Lorist\u2019s disciples, Reidy and Shuss. His father, Engelich, would not take the field, and Xanthi would only act to protect her adopted daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cTarkel\u2019s report,\u201d Lorist said, dripping a thick stack of paper onto the desk, \u201cThe old Union has been busy. They\u2019ve built up their forces and repaired their relationship with what\u2019s left of the alliance. They\u2019ve also been running an intense propaganda campaign against us. We\u2019ve been painted as the \u2018great northern threat\u2019, and they\u2019ve been painted as the south\u2019s defender. They are the guardians of civilization and we the barbarians from the north.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade chuckled. \u201cHas it been effective?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be sure. They\u2019ve salvaged their economy, at least. They\u2019ve also gained permission to recruit in several nations\u2019 lands. They\u2019ve also reformed Wessia and plopped it in Kamott near Tedanini. They\u2019ve set up several new factories there and are pumping out as much equipment as they can. They\u2019ve even dared to begin using the technology they stole from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose shameless bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith all the effort they\u2019re putting in, they must be betting everything on this one clash. It\u2019s clear they can\u2019t stay afloat as they are now, if they don\u2019t win this with the next clash, they\u2019ll crumble. If they do win, however, they\u2019ll wipe out most of our forces and cripple us for years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you confident?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly? No. This could go our way just as easily as not. We cannot pull out, however. We have to fight this. If we withdraw we lose this war, or at the very least we go back to where we were before we sacrificed so many men and all their deaths will have been in vain. I cannot shame my men like that. We have to fight this battle, and we have to win. Besides, it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have any tricks cards still up our sleeve.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

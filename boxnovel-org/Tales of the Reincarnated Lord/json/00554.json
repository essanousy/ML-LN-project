He says the duke is willing to secede from the Union, with our support. He wants us to move our forces in Mauvlin into Chalbuk in the second month and attack Quadro to cover his secession. Thereafter he wants us to keep the Union at bay until he has got his feet on the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade pointed at the map as he spoke, \u201cThe secession will deprive the Union of three more provinces: Jerotan, Chalbuk and Aligmai. Aligmai belongs to Mireitas, and he\u2019s willing to secede with Duke Peterson.</p><br/><p>\u201cAligmai used to belong to the Duchy of Teria. The duchy was split into two provinces after its conquest. The other province is Toscow. They\u2019re separated from one another by a river, and from the rest of the Union\u2019s territory by the Sunset mountain range. This means Aligmay doesn\u2019t have to worry about Union retaliation. Our main concern, thus, is Chalbuk and Quadro. If the Union really wants to strike back at the duke, they will strike through here.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe duke has three demands. The first, that we send forces to defend him. The second, to smooth things over between him and the Alliance so he can join it. Thirdly, to help them reform their military.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we fulfill these demands, he will cleanse his territory of loyalists and secede. Count Mireitas will do the same. Their declarations will come after next year\u2019s rainy season. This will be the final nail in the Union\u2019s coffin.</p><br/><p>\u201cCount Mireitas also gave us a key piece of information. The Union is running out of all kinds of supplies, salt most severely. None of their lands produce any salt. Peterson has a store of it thanks to a raid of the Kingdom of Wakaya years ago. If the Union gets its hand on it, it can last them another four years. Mireitas suspects that\u2019s behind Duke Cobleit\u2019s move to merge all the domains under his rule. If we get Peterson to break away, then we cut off their last hope at holding out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist didn\u2019t reply immediately. He tapped on the desk lightly as he considered his options. They were all old foxes. He should have expected that the old man would scheme, even in his current situation. He\u2019d put the duke in the worst possible position to see what he\u2019d do. But the man had hit back by putting him in an equally detestable position.</p><br/><p>Everything came down to how much aid the duke was demanding. The first two requests weren\u2019t much of an issue, the third was the problem. It was very vague and could technically mean anything.</p><br/><p>Lorist humphed, dissatisfied. Peterson wanted his men to give their lives so he could live peacefully. In his dreams. Lorist had wanted him to become a Union pariah, instead he had been town into the oil himself. He could also not move forward unless the duke fell out with the Union completely. As long as the two sides weren\u2019t mortal enemies, he could not be certain they weren\u2019t playing him and would ambush him at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMireitas sounds like a familiar name. Do you know his background?\u201d he finally asked.</p><br/><p>Charade nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cTarkel submitted a detailed report yesterday. He\u2019s an old acquaintance. He ran Dauslyke Hotel, along with many other all across the Union\u2019s territory, as well as in most of the Alliance\u2019s members.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so it was him. No wonder the name sounded familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist slapped his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of the anti-war\u2019ers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder. They suffered the most when the Union and the Alliance fell out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYet, Mireitas doesn\u2019t hate or blame the Alliance. He\u2019s one of Duke Cobleit strongest critics. His primary criticism appears to be that the duke has turned on the principles that underpinned the Union for so many years. He is also the only one that has never joined any of the campaigns the Union has had since the war with the old empire ended. Which is why he\u2019s only a count and has the desolate Aligmai as his territory.</p><br/><p>\u201cTurns out he\u2019s not just a merchant either. Noble blood runs in his veins. His ancestors some six generations ago were Romon nobles. A baron and close friend of the crown prince of the time. The power struggle that took place when the crown prince was supposed to ascend to the throne killed Mireitas\u2019s ancestor, however. The crown prince died soon after and his family was exiled. They came to the Union and started a guild. The rest is history.</p><br/><p>\u201cMireitas is also related to Peterson. Duke Peterson\u2019s mother is Mireitas\u2019s aunt. The two had an affair after they met during his father\u2019s stay at one of the guild\u2019s taverns. House Mireitas refused to let the woman become his father\u2019s mistress since he was already married, but she ran away and gave birth to the duke soon after.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis father\u2019s first wife died a few years later and he took his mistress as his wife. The relationship between the two guilds have recovered since. Peterson and Mireitas grew up together and are practically brothers. Mireitas has been kept out of harm\u2019s way because Peterson\u2019s been covering for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems Peterson is set on leaving the Union. He wouldn\u2019t send Mireitas here otherwise. Charade, ask the count to clarify what they mean by military aid. We can\u2019t agree to something so vague. If it\u2019s not excessive, we can see what we can do. Also, let\u2019s make it a contract rather than aid. They\u2019ll have to pay us for it, even if it is in installments for several years.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to help them for free. But we cannot do so since the Free Union and our other allies will immediately demand the same treatment. We\u2019re here to end the Union, not to give charity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist had an agenda, but he wasn\u2019t lying. The front was that he going to war with a distant enemy like the Trade Union. But he was really here for profit. It started because he was worried he would be surrounded by enemies if the kingdom lost the war, but now it was all about making money and gaining influence.</p><br/><p>Lorist had achieved every goal he\u2019d come here for and thought of since arriving. He didn\u2019t need to chase the Union into oblivion, but why not? Especially since he could do it without actually fighting them. He had originally wanted to push Peterson into war with the rest of the Union so they could keep each other busy for a while and give him a chance to return home. But then Peterson sent his requests. Why should he help the old man for free? He had nothing with which to threaten him, after all. If he wanted help, he damn well had to be willing to pay it back several times over.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Your Grace, Mireitas says the war has robbed them of all their wealth. They have nothing with which to pay us back,\u201d said Charade.</p><br/><p>Lorist smiled wryly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes they do. He has all that salt, doesn\u2019t he? I\u2019ll help him smuggle the salt out and then selling it to the Trade Union at a sky high price on the black market. We\u2019ll decide how much is sold and at what price. Half of the profits will go to funding his new kingdom, and the rest to repaying his debt.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

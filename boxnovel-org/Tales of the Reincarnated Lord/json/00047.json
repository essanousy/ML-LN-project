He didn\u2019t know if it was Kelly spreading rumors around, but the workers at the Gold ranked instructor residences started greeting him rather cheerfully. Sometimes, when they saw him walking by, they would step aside and bow when he passes by and bow deeply as they say, \u201cGood day, lord,\u201d which Lorist was horribly not used to.</p><br/><p>Then came Terman. It was already getting rather late that night when Shadekampf reported that Terman had come to visit.</p><br/><p>Lorist felt that it was rather weird as Terman usually wouldn\u2019t visit alone without anybody else, especially that late in the night. Maybe something\u2019s wrong? Or perhaps it\u2019s something about the Swordsmanship Society? Then again, there shouldn\u2019t be any activity since it\u2019s the semester break\u2026</p><br/><p>Lorist then went downstairs to receive Terman at the lounge.</p><br/><p>He asked Terman to have a seat only to be ignored. Instead, Terman stood in front of Lorist rather respectfully and said something that startled him badly. \u201cI\u2019ve resigned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lorist was totally stunned\u2026</p><br/><p>He\u2019s just joking, right? Terman\u2019s the vice captain of the Enforcement Academy and is also the vice chairman of the Swordsmanship Society\u2026 Why didn\u2019t I get notified about his resignation even though I\u2019m the Swordsmanship Society\u2019s chairman? Who permitted it?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it for the past few days and finally made my decision this afternoon. Charade doesn\u2019t know about it yet. I went to talk to the academy head about it and he has agreed to my resignation,\u201d said Terman solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat made you want to do that?\u201d Lorist got more confused the more he thought about it. Terman\u2019s position at the academy earned him roughly 9 gold Fordes every month. That was a salary that many would be envious of. Why did he suddenly resign?</p><br/><p>Terman lowered his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel that my days in the academy are far too uneventful and boring. I\u2019m starting to crave some real battles. My father told me that as a knight, the greatest shame he had was that he didn\u2019t perish on the battlefield but to an illness instead. Being a knight myself, I don\u2019t intend to succumb to the same fate as my father\u2019s. I believe I should go all over the place to seek conquest and battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2026 What kind of reason is that? Are you still the cool, collected and reliable Terman that everyone loves and trust? Don\u2019t tell me someone got transmigrated over here and took over your body? As Terman\u2019s good friend, Lorist felt that he had the responsibility to at least try to stop him from making such a rash decision before everything can no longer be taken back.</p><br/><p>Before he could think of something to convince Terman to reconsider his decision, Lorist saw Terman kneeling in front of him on one knee. \u201cLocke, this is the last time I will refer to you as such. Would you be so kind to take in a friend who has nowhere else to go with you on the journey north?</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Waprey Terman, am willing to pledge myself as a knight of the Norton Family and take you, Norton Lorist, as my lord and liege. I will follow in your steps and conquer your enemies for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist was shaken yet again\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He suddenly noticed Potterfang standing beside them with Lorist\u2019s longsword in hand which he passed to him.</p><br/><p>Drawing the sword out of the scabbard, Lorist tapped Terman on each shoulder twice and said solemnly, \u201cRise, my knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>And thus the simple knighting ceremony was completed. Potterfang received Terman with a hug and said, \u201cWelcome, my fellow brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, it\u2019s the good old welcome speech. At least that part is normal, thought Lorist.</p><br/><p>Shadekampf happily greeted Terman with a bow. As expected of the young master. Yet another Three Star Silver Swordsman joined us. Something like this would be unimaginable in the Northlands\u2026 The Norton Family will definitely prosper under the young master\u2019s leadership!</p><br/><p>Shadekampf suddenly recalled something important and hastily reminded his young master, \u201cYoung master, you still haven\u2019t had a family knight badge made. I\u2019ve brought you the design\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive this to Reidy and tell him to order it from the badge makers. Oh, and prepare one Gold ranked one as well. Pog\u2019s going to break through really soon,\u201d said Lorist.</p><br/><p>I really don\u2019t get why Terman would decide to pledge himself to me as a knight\u2026 Maybe that\u2019s the difference between this world and the one where I came from\u2026 In Lorist\u2019s previous world, the attitude of the people there were quite individualistic in that they often seeked accomplishments by their own ability to showcase their merit. However, the Grindians mostly racked up their accomplishments in service to a noble family instead. This was the main difference of the different cultures.</p><br/><p>Lorist was starting to get more and more frustrated at the glaring differences between the two cultures. \u201cOh, Terman, you have a high-ranked Battle Force manual that\u2019s passed down in your family already, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, milord,\u201d replied Terman.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t give you a Battle Force manual. Shadekampf, go to my study and get that piece of Mizek Stainless Steel Armor for Terman as his knighting gift,\u201d instructed Lorist.</p><br/><p>The Mizek Stainless Steel Armor was the staple product of the Mizek Sector of the Temanda Kingdom and was well-known for its relatively higher defense compared its counterparts which allowed it to withstand piercing strikes better than most other armors. However, the supply for the armor was rather low and it was really hard to even purchase one as it sold out rather quickly. Lorist had gotten one from President Peterson for 300 gold coins because he wanted to be protected any hidden attacks on the trip to his dominion. Never would he have expected that he would be giving it away just three days after getting his hands on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, milord,\u201d said Terman as he accepted the armor thankfully.</p><br/><p>Lorist then went upstairs and let Potterfang and Terman by themselves to celebrate the newly-formed brotherhood. \u201cI\u2019m going up to take a rest, I can already feel a headache coming. Terman, there\u2019s still a vacant guest room upstairs so you can move over for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Terman had already resigned from his post as a Gold ranked instructor, he could no longer stay at his villa at the instructor residences. It was fortunate that Lorist still had an empty room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, milord,\u201d said Terman,</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>The news of Lorist\u2019s departure to the north to become a dominion lord spread like wildfire overnight in the academy. When Lorist was returning to his villa from doing some errands, he bumped into Supervisor Skali who gleefully forced Lorist to come with her to her house where she advised Lorist to pay close attention to his health as the Northlands were desolate and much colder than the rest of the continent. After that, she took out a hand-knitted fur coat and gave it to him before wishing him all the best on his journey to become a great lord.</p><br/><p>Lorist accepted the coat but he was still curious about how she got to know all that even when he didn\u2019t mention a word of this to anyone else\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After dinner, Instructor Marlin came to visit and brought along a large chest which he said contained the things his wife always used and said that it was his gift to Lorist as he believed that it would prove pretty useful during his journey.</p><br/><p>Lorist almost fainted when he heard that and desperately tried to reject the gift. Why would he need the things Marlin\u2019s wife used on the trip? His misunderstanding persisted until Marlin opened the chest. In the box were a set of horse armor, a saddle and some stirrups. Apparently, Instructor Marlin often referred to his treasured horse Jenny as his second wife.</p><br/><p>Carefully caressing the items, he told Lorist that since Jenny was getting old and losing its ability to gallop, the items weren\u2019t much use for it and he only kept them for old times\u2019 sake. Now that Lorist would no doubt be riding on a horse or two on the journey north, these items would prove quite useful, especially the armor, which would give a horse a decent boost in defense.</p><br/><p>Thanking Instructor Marlin, Lorist opened a couple of bottles of wine and drank together with him.</p><br/><p>Instructor Marlin chatted with him quite cheerfully as he bragged about the heroic antics in the days when he served in the city garrison. In the end, he was sent back home totally wasted.</p><br/><p>During the afternoon of the next day, it was Instructor Anfya\u2019s turn to come pay a visit. She brought with her yet another large chest. First and foremost, she told Lorist about her husband, Instructor Claude\u2019s successful breakthrough to the Blademaster level after gaining some insights following more than half a year of training. This was an event that would forever change the Dawn Academy\u2019s status, position and their reputation.</p><br/><p>Lorist hurriedly congratulated her. Instructor Anfya then told him that within the chest were seven good quality swords which were part of Instructor Claude\u2019s collection. He had heard that Lorist was about to leave for the Northlands to inherit his position as the lord and believed that these swords would come in useful. While he was confident in Lorist\u2019s swordsmanship, he was concerned that Lorist\u2019s longsword wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the constant battles that he would no doubt experience in the future. That\u2019s why he decided to present these swords to him to aid in his journey.</p><br/><p>Lorist thanked her again and started to think about what to gift to Instructor Claude to congratulate him for his recent success. Already seeing through Lorist\u2019s intentions, Anfya politely declined the kind sentiment. She mentioned that the main factor for her husband\u2019s breakthrough was the duel he had with Lorist one year back which gave him many insights to ponder over. As for herself, she said that she had already learned the art of pulse reading from Lorist so he didn\u2019t need to trouble himself over something like that.</p><br/><p>Hearing Instructor Anfya put it like that, Lorist laughed out loud. While he couldn\u2019t think of anything to give to Instructor Claude, he had the perfect gift for her wife. Asking for her to wait downstairs, Lorist went up to his study and came back down with an intricate box in hand a gave it to her.</p><br/><p>Instructor Anfya opened the box and was incredibly delighted. Just as she was about to take it out to closer inspect the gift, Lorist told her to take her time at home and also reminded her to not tell anybody else that she got it from him to save himself some trouble.</p><br/><p>Instructor Anfya nodded and carefully made her way back with the box safe in her embrace.</p><br/><p>In the following days, Lorist received tons of gifts that filled his study whole. Almost every one of his acquaintances came over to give him a parting gift that ranged from weapons, gloves, shoes, cloaks as well as cold-resistant clothing. Instructor Hughes gifted him a good set of leather armor while Welledor, the knight training instructor, gave him a pair of golden horse spurs. Instructor Wensen from the horse riding course gifted Lorist a fine Illinoihaus Horse. The breed of the horse was the favorite of heavy-armored knights as it was large in stature and was able to withstand a relatively heavier load as well as being quite intelligent and had one of the fastest acceleration times. The only drawback was that it wasn\u2019t suited to long distance gallops and was rather picky with its food.</p><br/><p>Loboff from the herbalism faculty gave Lorist a set of test tubes and lab apparatus commonly used in the concoction of herbal medicines. The chest that contained the tools was even cushioned properly so that the things within wouldn\u2019t easily break. Lorist really didn\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going back to be a herbalist, am I? What would I be able to use it for?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Next came Charade and Yuriy. Lorist felt relieved when he saw that the both of them came empty-handed and seemed that they were not here to send him off with gifts. He invited them to the lounge and Lorist was shocked the moment he heard what Yuriy had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cLocke, I have come here today with Brother Charade to join you on your journey. We have both resigned and are ready to become your knights.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade merely stood there pouting without saying a word.</p><br/><p>Yuriy stared at Lorist go into the washroom and come out with a mirror-like silver plate in his hand. After looking into his reflection for a few moments, he finally let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cLocke, what are you up to?\u201d asked Yuriy, weirded out by Lorist\u2019s erratic actions.</p><br/><p>Lorist replied, \u201cI was checking if something had suddenly grown on my face and gave me a domineering air that caused the two of you to join my cause. Good thing there wasn\u2019t anything weird, cause you guys are just messing with me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuriy laughed out and said, \u201cLocke, we\u2019re serious about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist didn\u2019t want to believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, stop kidding around. I still have lots of things I need to work on and I\u2019m already exhausted. To joke around with me at a time like that is really not what friends do, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuriy\u2019s face turned solemn as he said, \u201cLocke, I\u2019ve really resigned from the academy. You know that I\u2019m from the plains of the Khawistan Khanate\u2019s, right? Had it not been for the fact that my parents saved a count\u2019s life before, I wouldn\u2019t be studying at Morante City now. Just a while back, that count came back to me and asked whether I would like to become a knight under his family. I\u2019ve turned him down as my father had perished under his service. While I\u2019m the horsemanship instructor at the Dawn Academy, the students of my course don\u2019t respect me as I\u2019m originally from the grassy plains. You should know this as well. Had it not been for you and our friends, I would have left this place long ago. Now that Terman has chosen to follow you, I would like to as well. I believe that he made the right choice to become your knight. This way, we can all be together even after you leave for the north.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, your reasoning has left me fully convinced. I welcome your participation, Yuriy. But what about the fatty? Since when was he the kind of person who would be willing to serve under another?\u201d asked Lorist as he looked at the pouting Charade.</p><br/><p>Yuriy laughed before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s like this. He received quite a bit of shock during this afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShock? What kind of master was able to pull that off? I should really pay that person a visit to learn that from him,\u201d said Lorist curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was Terman,\u201d Yuriy replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way. How did Terman even do that?\u201d Lorist was intrigued. Terman has always been a straightforward fellow who had always been messed around by the fatty instead of the other way round.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Charade\u2019s father come over a couple of days ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, I know about that. I even paid him a visit,\u201d nodded Lorist.</p><br/><p>Charade was also not a local of Morante City. His family came from the Teribo Kingdom which was famous for its green and oil glass products. His father was a merchant who had property in both Morante City and the capital of the Teribo Kingdom. Other than that, he was also the cousin brother of Academy Head Levins and also contributed quite a lot financially to the academy. This was also why Charade was able to act so unrestrainedly as nobody dared to find any trouble with what he did.</p><br/><p>During the two days Charade\u2019s father came to visit, he treated Academy Head Levins to a meal. After the meal, they decided to wander around in the academy, only to bump into Terman and Yuriy.</p><br/><p>At that time, Yuriy was conflicted as to whether he should resign just like Terman. When he left his quarters, he saw Charade\u2019s father and Academy Head Levins and went forward to greet them. Just as he was about to wave hello, Terman approached while wearing the Norton Family\u2019s knight badge with Charade following him. As Charade was laughing at Terman\u2019s newly-obtained badge, Charade\u2019s father quickly pulled him away and gave a deep bow to Terman and asked extremely politely, \u201cGood day, milord. Is there anything I can help you with?\u2019</p><br/><p>Terman, Charade, Yuriy and Levins were all stunned speechless\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the atmosphere turned weird in an instant. Charade\u2019s father then asked carefully, \u201cMilord, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Terman instantly ran away\u2026</p><br/><p>After snapping out of his trance, Charade shouted at his father. \u201cDad, that\u2019s my friend! Why did you do that?! That\u2019s super embarrassing! Gah!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Charade\u2019s father knocked his head harshly and said, \u201cThat guy is a noble! Did you not see that badge on his chest? What a domineering Raging Bear! The sides of the badge also have a laurel design, which means that the family has at least 200 years of history. Even if he is your friend, you still have to act respectfully. There is nothing embarrassing about that, got it?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, there are two things that is worth one\u2019s respect. The first is a noble title and the other is knowledge. For example, your Uncle Levins here is respected for his extensive knowledge and the status of an academy head. However, knowledge can only awe a person for so long before it ceases to be inspiring once a certain amount of time passes. However, noble titles that can be passed down through generations can even raise the status of the whole family. Don\u2019t think that just because I\u2019m wealthy, I don\u2019t have to abide by these customs. Even the richest man would need to show utmost respect when seeing a noble from a rural area, because they have the right and power to kill any commoner that dares to disrespect them, and that includes you as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even bother getting pissed off now. Are you thinking that you got away with getting on the bad side of some nobles before? Those people are different from landed nobles. They are mere honorary nobles whose titles are empty and hollow as they don\u2019t have a proper dominion, just like Uncle Levins. His title is only honorary and it can\u2019t be passed down to his descendants. You can easily tell the difference from the badges they wear. Why is your uncle not wearing his noble badge, you may ask? That\u2019s because he feels that it\u2019s embarrassing as he doesn\u2019t have a dominion nor does he have subordinates of his own. Without those, what kind of influence would one have anyway?\u201d</p><br/><p>Academy Head Levins was still speechless\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault for not being able to procure a noble title for you to inherit. The titles you can purchase with money are merely honorary titles which don\u2019t really mean much. If you can manage to get a hereditary noble title for family, then I would die without any regrets! Your status in the academy doesn\u2019t count for crap in the real world. In the end, you\u2019re only a tool for your uncle\u2019s use to settle his problems. Think about it, aren\u2019t you just like the bodyguards of the high-ranked officials of the Trade Union? Even though they seem high and mighty and earn lots of money, they are but useless tools that can only follow orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Academy Head Levins started freezing all over again\u2026</p><br/><p>Charade\u2019s father sighed once again before continuing, \u201cBack then I placed my hopes on you to help the family gain a noble title. But looking at you now, I only hope you can live out the rest of your life peacefully. Let\u2019s hope that your sons and grandchildren will try harder to achieve that dream for our family\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Charade\u2019s father turned and walked away alone, leaving Academy Head Levins, Charade and Yuriy standing amidst the leaves that were blown up by the twirling gust\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The three of them were completely silent. At that moment, Yuriy used the opportunity to tell the academy head about his resignation, to which he agreed immediately.</p><br/><p>Seeing the fatty who was standing there flabbergasted, Yuriy added, \u201cCharade here is also going to resign\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Academy Head Levins merely turned to his back and started to leave. But he still said one thing, \u201cGo\u2026 All of you, leave as you please. I hope that your ambitions will be achieved and wish you a safe journey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that was what happened earlier. Locke, if you don\u2019t accept us as your family knights, then we\u2019ll have no choice but wander around as lordless knights,\u201d said Yuriy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

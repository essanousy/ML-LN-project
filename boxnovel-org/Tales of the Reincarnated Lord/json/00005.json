This young noble youth donned an intricately cut shirt under a white leather vest with baggy pants that were decorated with threads of gold. Numerous diamonds that were set on his boots could be seen gleaming in the sunlight while the collar of his shirt boasted two golden buttons. On the outermost layer was a refined black linen coat that was fastened tightly around his body by a black belt. The youth exuded an aura of elegance with a hint of defiance in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The guy had a superficial smile that was typical among nobles which caused Lorist to feel a sudden impulse to throw a punch at his face. Although that person looked familiar, Lorist felt much disdain towards his condescending, prideful gaze which held no one else in any regard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat business do you have here?\u201d asked Charade with a serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Instructor Charade. I\u2019m only here to ask if Instructor Locke has missed me since we last met,\u201d nodded the youth to Charade and subsequently turning his gaze to Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear Instructor Locke, I, your former student, has come to pay my respects to you. I am eternally grateful for the guidance you have provided during these past few years. I heard that you\u2019ve been unable to progress in your Battle Force training. That\u2019s certainly too bad. As of late, I\u2019ve managed to break through to the Three Star Silver rank and I have decided to return to the academy to offer my thanks for your lessons and advice. To my surprise, I\u2019ve heard that you will be accepting duels from Silver ranked students, and that really awed me, since there\u2019s a great disparity between your Battle Force and that of Silver Swordsmen. I got the news a little too late and ended up being placed behind a number of your other challengers. My only hope is that you defeat all the others so that I may taste your blade and receive your education again. Please try hard for this student\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying all that, the noble youth bowed, before retreating a few steps and walking away.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on? He seemed sincere when he said all that, but something still felt off. What\u2019s up with that guy, thought Lorist. He proceeded to ask Charade, \u201cWho was that guy? He just came up to me with five or six other followers and said some really weird stuff. Somehow, he looks kind of familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade rolled his eyes. \u201cCome on, you really don\u2019t remember him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I kind of remember seeing him some time ago\u2026 But I really can\u2019t recall who he is. He did seem like he was some kind of big shot though\u2026 He looks pretty loaded too,\u201d answered Lorist honestly.</p><br/><p>Charade clapped his hands in amazement and said, \u201cHe lost to you in a duel before. Remember three years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree years back? What happened at that time?\u201d Lorist still couldn\u2019t recall that incident.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026 Even if you can\u2019t recall it now, that guy couldn\u2019t forget it even if he wanted to. When you were first appointed as an official swordsmanship instructor three years ago, that bloke brought a group of other students to ambush you. He was the main perpetrator of the incident that occurred during the last dual elite course, and was also the one that you punished the hardest. He ended up bruised all over, with several broken ribs and got bandaged up like a large mummy,\u201d recalled Charade painfully.</p><br/><p>Oh, so it was that guy. Lorist finally remembered.</p><br/><p>Every three years, the Dawn Academy has special training session for the students who excelled in both Battle Force and swordsmanship. It was called the \u201cdual elite course\u201d and was also regarded as one of the most difficult courses offered by the academy. Given that the students that attended the course were the top among their peers in both disciplines, and that most of them were nobles with their own unique Battle Force techniques passed down through their families, the students were extremely arrogant and prideful and would not accept an instructor who lacked the necessary qualifications.</p><br/><p>Three years ago Lorist was just appointed as an official swordsmanship instructor and had been given the task of teaching the dual elite class. Naturally, there were students who looked down on him, but all of them were utterly defeated by Lorist. That youth just now was ranked one of the top two in terms of swordsmanship and was also an assistant instructor of the dual elite course. He was swiftly defeated in a duel with Lorist after merely three blows. Unable to suppress his hatred after his loss, he managed to manipulate the other students into attacking Lorist en masse while he himself attempted to strike at Lorist while he was occupied, desiring to put an end to Lorist\u2019s life with the cruelest method available to him.</p><br/><p>Lorist, unable to suppress his anger at that guy\u2019s actions, utterly pummeled him to the point where he could not go through daily life without assistance and was bedridden for more than six months.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, didn\u2019t you say he went away to recover and even decided to leave school? Logically speaking, shouldn\u2019t he be brimming with hate and desperately trying to kill me? Why did he even come to pay his respects?\u201d asked Lorist as he stroked his chin, annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d laughed the fatty, \u201cThis is a custom of the nobles. Even if they were facing their archenemy and was going to challenge them to a duel to the death, they would still extend their greetings and salute the enemy. This is called \u2018being chivalrous\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he to come over like that and spout all that insincere nonsense about me not letting him down and fighting my way to him! So what if he\u2019s a Three Star Silver Swordsman! I\u2019ve defeated tons of people of that caliber!\u201d said Lorist, disgruntled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you better look out for that youngster. Do you know his family background?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember anything else about him, not even his name\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Sigh, forget it. Let me tell you. That kid is called Sandoz Hirda and he\u2019s the second son of the Archduke of the Kalia Kingdom, Sandoz Lyam. You do know about the Kalia Kingdom, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do. It\u2019s one of the neighboring nations of the Forde Trade Union and was located somewhere southeast of the union, I think,\u201d answered Lorist after contemplating for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the east of the Kalia Kingdom is the Romon Empire and to its south lies the Khawistan Khanate. Do you know why there has been no conflict between the Kalia Kingdom and the two major powers right next to it?\u201d asked Charade seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Lorist honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the Kalia Kingdom has a Sword Saint. Neither the Romon Empire nor the Khawistan Khanate wishes to agitate that person. The Kalia Sword Saint is also known as the \u2018Tempest Sword Saint\u2019. According to rumors, he revealed his power once when he was still only a Blademaster: when the rain poured, he could pierce every single raindrop with his sword and after the shower, an area of three meters from the spot where he danced with his sword was completely dry, causing his name to instantly soar to fame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Sandoz Hirda whom you\u2019ve beaten up has since become the disciple of the Tempest Sword Saint. Think about it, three years ago he was merely a One Star Silver Swordsman, Right now, he\u2019s already at three stars. He must have trained very hard all this time to settle this grudge with you. Some rumors say that he challenged those of the same rank as him and defeated them with merely two to three strikes. It seems that he\u2019s confident of being able to take that gold swordsmanship instructor badge from you. You better watch out, Locke, he\u2019s not your average small fry. Let me check his number\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade took out a few sheepskin scrolls and scanned through them for a while. \u201cIt\u2019s here. He\u2019s your 284th challenger. He must have registered just yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lorist exclaimed, starting. \u201cFatty! When did the registration start!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo days ago\u2026\u201d said Charade as he silently smiled. \u201cAs of now, there are more than 350 applicants. There were 30 others when I was walking over from the Enforcement Department just now. I believe it\u2019ll hit 400 by today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist flicked his middle finger at Charade. \u201cI\u2019m really gonna give it to that old bastard! Does he want me to die!? How is that even remotely reasonable?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fatty snickered like a fox who just stole a chicken. \u201cThe old bastard just rebuked me this morning for not being able to see the big picture. He said that we should open the registration to the whole of the Academy Sector, and after that, Morante City! Maybe when this gig gets big, we can even let challengers from the Falik Plains come! In time, news of this will spread throughout the continent and there will be more challengers than we can count! By then, the profit we\u2019ll make from the registration fee will increase exponentially and our academy\u2019s reputation as well as influence will also rise\u2026 I\u2019ll be sending some students to go post the notices around the city later this afternoon, especially in the taverns and mercenary guilds\u2026 I\u2019ll need even more notices for those places.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Lorist staggered and almost fell face first to the ground.</p><br/><p>The fatty delivered the final blow, saying, \u201cThe old bastard already said that he hopes that this year there will be as many as 3600 challengers. This way, he can arrange 10 duels per day for you. That\u2019s actually going rather easy on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBam!\u201d Lorist fell straight to the floor, struggled to get up, flashed two middle fingers at Charade and walked away swiftly.</p><br/><p>Charade was still yelling, \u201cLocke, you better be careful of Hirda! Don\u2019t be careless and lose to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hirda can just go to hell. He\u2019s just a Three Star Silver Swordsman, thought Lorist as he dismissed the possibility of him losing to Hirda entirely. Lorist felt ever more confident in his abilities ever since his four months of training at the Relic Islands, Over there, a leader of some mercenary group who was a Two Star Gold Swordsman had been trampled and roughed up by a Dark-scaled Rhinoceros while he easily took care of that beast with a single strike.</p><br/><p>Should he challenge Instructor Claude or any other peak Three Star Gold Swordsman to a duel, Lorist believed that it would take more than a 1000 moves before a victor can be decided, and he might just be the victor. Lorist wasn\u2019t being conceited or boastful; although his Battle Force was only at the Three Star Iron rank, he gained much benefit from training in the Aquametal Ki Technique passed down in his past life\u2019s family.</p><br/><p>Just by squeezing his palms, he could easily pulverize a thumb-sized rock into fine grains. This was the power of the \"Inch\" component of the Aquametal Technique. In his past life, he had trained in the technique for more than 30 years, but he hasn\u2019t even reached the peak of the Bright Stage of the technique; the Dark Stage was even further away. However, in this world, by training his Battle Force with the Aquametal Technique, he managed to achieve the Dark Stage within a short span of four years. Maybe this world was more suited for training the internal energies of the body.</p><br/><p>Silver Battle Force could be projected onto a sword and cause a sword glow to form which can only be blocked by weapons that are also infused with Battle Force. Battle Force infused weapons could easily dominate and overcome common weapons or shields. While Lorist himself couldn\u2019t form a sword glow, he could still infuse his weapon with Battle Force or internal energy and grant the weapon extraordinary strength and sharpness that rivals even those of weapons that emanated sword glows. Only, that effect was usually unnoticed by most other people as the energy was hidden from the eye and focused within the blade.</p><br/><p>Currently, he could circulate his Battle Force with some methods from the Aquametal Technique at will and perfectly coordinate his body motion and his strikes, allowing him to execute forceful, fluid movements while maintaining a stable breathing rhythm, and every step he took was silent and stealthy as well as being firm and stable. His dantian contained boundless Ki energy which rapidly regenerated before he even got to use it up. That was the power of one who has reached the Dark Stage, as described by his family\u2019s technique manual.</p><br/><p>The only difference was that the Aquametal Technique manual states that at the Dark Stage, the meridian points at the temples would swell up. Lorist\u2019s temple meridian points, however, were still flat and ordinary. He figured that it could be due to him training in the technique using Battle Force. Since that had no observable repercussions, Lorist didn\u2019t worry about it too much. His was more troubled by that darned academy head who was treating him like a money printing machine. He didn\u2019t mind dueling others himself and was already used to it. Furthermore, this body\u2019s enhanced dynamic vision gave him quite an edge; Lorist had never considered Silver Swordsmen to be a threat.</p><br/><p>Ten duels a day wasn\u2019t strenuous for him either. It only took a few sword blows to end the duels; his usual swordsmanship classes required him to participate in ten or more mock battles to give his students some hands-on experience, and the fact that he had to point out his students\u2019 flaws made that even more troublesome than simple dueling. The only kind of combatant who would pose an actual threat to him were those who were at least of the Two Star Gold rank. Then again, no self respecting Gold Swordsman would stoop so low to challenge him to a duel.</p><br/><p>His main frustration was that he had been ordered to duel others rather than asking for the duels himself. To him, that wasn\u2019t the same at all. That old bastard was profiting off his labor while he had to do all the work! Lorist solemnly cursed that old bastard to one day be buried and crushed to death by all those gold coins he made.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

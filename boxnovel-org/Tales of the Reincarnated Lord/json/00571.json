Why are there so many shops here when the guilds have left?\u201d asked he.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got the wrong idea. The taxes aren\u2019t on owning shops, but on having offices. His tax is three-tenths of the profit of any guild headquartered in the capital.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the shops, they\u2019re mostly backed by nobles and only have to pay a one-tenth goods tax, nothing else. The king can\u2019t pocket the money belonging to nobles, right? Paying one-tenth tribute is already showing enough respect to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, the king wanted guilds to pay an annual tribute as continual proof of their loyalty. This street would be completely deserted if not for how lucrative business is here. Even so, most are only just making it by. They consider it tossing a few bones to stray dogs. It\u2019s fine as long as they\u2019re still making some profit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist shook his head. Auguslo was too biased against merchants. He was your stereotypical noble; he thought all merchants were rich men, and they were doing nothing but siphoning his wealth away by doing business in his lands.</p><br/><p>The merchants certainly didn\u2019t have a good picture of him. He was a parasite as far as they were concerned. He didn\u2019t have the skills and wit to make money himself, so he just leached off them instead. Lorist didn\u2019t know how the imperial bloodline had produced such an incompetent fool. Just one of his taxes was enough to chase all the merchants away. What good did a tax do him if there was no one who could be taxed?</p><br/><p>At best, the king could possibly think on the most rudimentary level of taxation, taking a cut of exchanged goods. He was truly a fool. So that was why he was always running out of money when he needed it the most.</p><br/><p>The carriage stopped at a four-story building. It had a grand gold-laden plaque. Kenmays had decorated the place according to his tastes, so their lavishness competed with the palace. Five buildings had been connected to great a single megastore. Most of its products came from the Northlands, mainly salt, glassware, and white paper. Kenmays did contribute a good item to the lineup, however: his maid uniforms.</p><br/><p>Lorist, Kenmays, and Loze disembarked and walked inside. Kenmays chatted busily with the manager, letting Lorist stroll through the shop. He had to admit, Kenmays was decently talented at running businesses. Despite how messy and cluttered the shop was, it raked in a million gold in an average year.</p><br/><p>Kenmays finished his business quickly and dragged his two companion to the back of the shop. A large yard filled the space between the five buildings. Most of the goods were held in crates under shed roofs there. Most of the shop\u2019s guards also stood watch there. The shop had 18 silver ranks in their employ for the night shift alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring the night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kenmays nodded, \u201cThree shops in the street were robbed during the night. It\u2019s the most dangerous time of day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thieves didn\u2019t kill anyone though. They knocked the guards out and vanished with everything in the shops and their stores. It was an immense embarrassment for the king to be unable to solve the cases that he was forced to fire two consecutive chiefs of security.</p><br/><p>\u201cI sent a bunch of silvers over when I heard about it and we haven\u2019t had any issues since.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow stupid... the thieves obviously left the moment they finished stealing. What is the man doing still looking for them in the city?\u201d Loze snorted.</p><br/><p>Kenmays nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree, but who am I to question how the king squanders his reputation? It\u2019s also partially the shops\u2019 fault for being so complacent and lax with their security.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was their business?\u201d asked Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cLamando sells jade-studded products, Pistachio deals in gold and silverware, and Whiterose sells luxury crystal decorations\u2026 Wait a minute\u2026 They were here for riches! Those shops had the most expensive stuff and the things easiest to steal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kenmays took them further into the maze to a large courtyard with a small door. The inside was as grand as a mansion, however.</p><br/><p>\u201cI usually stay here when visiting. The main door exits onto the main street, but I usually don\u2019t use it. I brought you here so you can get a feel for the path,\u201d Kenmays said to Loze, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we hold a ball here tonight to celebrate you becoming a blademaster? I\u2019ll organize a few good dancers and you can even stay overnight if you </p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll the details to you then,\u201d Loze smiled.</p><br/><p>Lorist was quite dissatisfied. He was a swordsaint, so he had to maintain a certain level of decorum. He couldn\u2019t attend Kenmays\u2019 balls. And it was even worse since his women were in the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve brought Loze here yourself. Why bring me along?\u201d complained Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou own a tenth of the committee, it won\u2019t do for you to be completely ignorant of our business in the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ugh, why did he always have to have an answer for everything?</p><br/><p>Kenmays vanished into what was probably his office for a while to organize things for the ball. He didn\u2019t forget to tell Loze about every pretty women that might possibly attend. Lorist had little interest in such frivolous business so he strolled around the shop instead.</p><br/><p>It was decently busy. There was always at least a couple of people in the middle of picking out something to buy. That said, few bought more than one or two things so the sum of money exchanged was never extravagant. He kept an eye on the counter for a while before losing interest and walking out onto the street.</p><br/><p>He shouldn\u2019t have come along. This was nothing but a waist. Lorist called out to a taxi. Just as one started slowing down, however, he noticed a commotion nearby. What was going on? It might be interesting, so he went over to take a look.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful ladies, this one\u2019s master graciously extends an invitation to the ball my master will be hosting tonight. Please accept this invitation and these gifts. My Lordship, a count, will gladly welcome you, ladies...\u201d</p><br/><p>So some noble was courting people again\u2026 Lorist might have thought it was one of Kenmays\u2019s lackeys if the man hadn\u2019t said his master was a count. His gaze sharpened on the man and he suddenly stomped forward, shoving the people in his way aside. Everyone quickly made way for him like a parting ocean once his temper flared.</p><br/><p>The idiot\u2019s poor victims were none other than Lorist\u2019s women. Sylvia and the four concubines were trying to get rid of the bastard. Normally that would have been the job of their guards, but these were buried under shopping bags.</p><br/><p>The bastard was trying to force his master\u2019s invitations on them. The five women were acting as if he didn\u2019t exist and trying to leave, but he had jumped in front of them and was bowing shamelessly as if his life would be over if they didn\u2019t accept.</p><br/><p>Lorist burst out of the crowd and grabbed the invitation. He flicked it once and tore it into shreds, letting them float to the ground in front of the man. He turned around to see his guard awkwardly trying to lower their heads for a bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. You\u2019ll drop something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d asked Sylvia.</p><br/><p>Despite her words, Lorist got the impression she was actually saying \u2018look at what I\u2019ve bought!\u2019. Gah... women\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are the children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing in a pond nearby. Godmother and Patt are watching them, don\u2019t worry. Oh, Locke, I bought you a new deerskin coat. It\u2019s really soft and stylish. Come, let\u2019s go try it on, that shop has a fitting room--\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201c--You... how dare you tear up my master\u2019s invitation? Are you insulting him?\u201d said the man with a raspy voice.</p><br/><p>His face looked like a tomato, glaring furiously at Lorist.</p><br/><p>\u201cBuzz off,\u201d Lorist spat softly, \u201cGet out of my sight before I run out of patience. If you piss me off I\u2019ll wipe out your so-called master and his family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d</p><br/><p>What gave this little man the guts to be so bold?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you say something so unreasonable and rude! Are you trying to commit treason?! Do you know who my lord is? I doubt you have the balls to do something like exterminate his whole family! Everyone has heard you! Don\u2019t be surprised if you lose your land and title!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ugh, so he was of the sharp-tongued variety. How irritating.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I don\u2019t know or care who your master is. How is killing a little count treason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause my master is Lord Wecksas, son of the king! Threatening to kill his family is threatening to kill the king!\u201d said the butler proudly and gleefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Just him? I thought he would at least have some clout, but it turns out your master is just a bastard. You should actually be caned for suggesting he has anything to do with the royal family. Know your place! I\u2019ll forgive you this time, but there won\u2019t be a next time, now scram!-- Lorist turned to the guards. \u201c--How did you end up getting entangled with that fool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know, Your Grace. The ladies were just shopping when he came out of nowhere and tried to invite the ladies to a ball. He wouldn\u2019t stop pestering them and refused to let them go without accepting the invitation and promising to attend,\u201d one of the guards answered from behind the gift packages.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou... Slander! How dare you slander the royal family! Know your crimes for what they are!\u201d the butler butted in again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Your Grace?\u201d asked Patt as he pushed out of the crowd accompanied by a dozen guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a pest. Kill quickly and we can be on our way.\u201d Lorist said, pointing at the middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>Lorist would have cut him down himself, but he felt it beneath him as a swordsaint to raise even just the finger needed to kill the man against him directly. In fact, it would be a great honor for the man\u2019s family to have him killed by a swordsaint, and they didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patt immediately drew his sword without question and walked towards the butler, a sinister smile plastered on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou... you dare harm someone in broad daylight?!\u201d</p><br/><p>It finally dawned on the butler that he might be pissing against the wrong tree. He tried to make a run for it, but he was completely surrounded by an impenetrable crowd of his own making.</p><br/><p>Patt finally made it to him and lifted him by the scruff of his neck before slamming him into the ground unceremoniously.</p><br/><p>The butler shivered as all the color bled out of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-mercy...\u201d he whispered through chattering teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Who dares kill in the capital?\u201d cried a loud voice from outside the circle of the crowd.</p><br/><p>So the watch had finally showed up.</p><br/><p>Patt didn\u2019t listen to them, however. He took orders from one man and one man only. Without his word, this man would be dead in a few moments. And indeed it was so. The man\u2019s head soon rolled away from his body, his severed neck painting the cobblestones of the road.</p><br/><p>The crowd withdrew several withering steps like leaves recoiling from the heat of a fire. No on None thought someone would actually kill in the capital in broad daylight, right in front of the watch as well. The police finally forced their way through a few moments later.</p><br/><p>The leader, a burly and bearded man, glanced at the corpse and immediately took action.</p><br/><p>\u201cCapture all of them! Kill anyone who resists!\u201d</p><br/><p>His men blew their whistles before charging at the group, weapons drawn.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

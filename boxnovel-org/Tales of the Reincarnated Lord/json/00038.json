From Lorist\u2019s point of view, the hastily created blades of light seemed to form a large net that sealed off all his surroundings.</p><br/><p>The figure that rushed towards Lorist was the annoyed junior assailant. His strikes were lethal and aimed to take his life, despite what the senior assailant said to only take his arm.</p><br/><p>Lorist let out a cold snort and drew his sword without backing down. The moment Lorist\u2019s sword struck out, the countless light blade attacks that flew towards Lorist dissipated without a trace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha\u2026\u201d The opponent was caught off guard by Lorist\u2019s successful attempt at deflecting the light blades. Not only that, Lorist instantly took the initiative and lashed out at the assailant without sparing a single moment. In but an instant, the assailant took a defensive stance as he struggled to block Lorist\u2019s flurry of attacks.</p><br/><p>The opponent tried to use brute force and take advantage of the disparity in power between a Gold rank and an Iron rank to break Lorist\u2019s stance. However, Lorist\u2019s swordsmanship was too unpredictable and managed to suppress the enemy\u2019s move before it was even able to be unleashed and followed up with a flurry of incessant attacks like a rush of floodwater which forces its way through any gap, however small. The constant flow of strikes forced the opponent into a situation where he could only defend without being able to counterattack. Lorist\u2019s swings also changed trajectory often before it landed and aimed for the attacker\u2019s openings, forcing the attacker to gradually move backwards.</p><br/><p>The enemy was already sweating all over. Had it not been for Lorist\u2019s constant pressuring that didn\u2019t allow him to catch any breath, he would\u2019ve already called for help from his senior apprentice brother long ago. Not even while dreaming could he ever imagine fighting against someone with swordsmanship as fearsome as this that rendered the difference in raw power between a Gold rank and an Iron rank nonexistent. At this moment, Lorist\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t like that of an Iron rank\u2019s at all. The assailant has only felt pressured like this when he sparred against his other Blademaster senior apprentice brother.</p><br/><p>Behind Lorist, loud constant sounds of swords clashing rang out and stopped. Only Potterfang\u2019s ragged breathing and the other assailant\u2019s cry of despair could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 Agh! It hurts\u2026 You madman! Ugh\u2026 It hurts as hell\u2026 Junior, how are you holding up? Quickly settle that bastard and come help me out! This Silver rank is a total madman I tell you! Ugh\u2026\u201d The senior assailant actually got a large cut and groaned away in agony.</p><br/><p>Potterfang laughed softly before saying, \u201cCome on. This was how I took care of Gold ranks on the battlefield. I take two of your strikes to deal one back. Three for one if I have to. Let\u2019s see who can take more attacks before collapsing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That senior assailant no longer dared to attack Potterfang head on and only gritted his teeth as he circled around Potterfang while unleashing ranged light blade attacks as he called out for his junior to help out. He even berated his junior nonstop for taking so long to kill a mere Iron rank.</p><br/><p>Little did the senior assailant know about the junior\u2019s woes. Hearing that Potterfang got injured, Lorist increased the ferocity of his attacks and didn\u2019t give too much heed to technique and forcefully struck towards the opponent\u2019s chest. The junior assailant hastily took a few steps back while deflecting several waves of attacks with much fear in his eyes. Initially, he was happy that Lorist took the offensive against him and thought that he would be able to break Lorist\u2019s longsword with his higher ranked Battle Force. Even if the sword didn\u2019t break, he would still manage to make Lorist suffer a huge lost based on the pure difference in power.</p><br/><p>Before, the assailant found it hard to parry Lorist\u2019s swift and careful strikes. Currently, Lorist no longer cared much for finesse and technique and attacked with brute force. The junior assailant gladly brought his sword to meet Lorist\u2019s only to discover that what he had expected to transpire didn\u2019t happen and instead, he felt a strong wave of force passing through his own sword that caused him to loosen his grip on his weapon. The longsword was knocked out of the junior assailant\u2019s hands and he instantly scrambled backwards in fear and somehow still managed to escape certain death.</p><br/><p>Lorist was incredibly frustrated. Before, he had thought his opponent would take quite an effort on his part to defeat given how much he had boasted before. But now, all the assailant did was defend and dodge all over the place without any intention of counterattacking. No matter how formidable Lorist\u2019s swordsmanship was, it wouldn\u2019t be of much use against an opponent who didn\u2019t dare to take a single one of his strikes.</p><br/><p>This won\u2019t do, thought Lorist as the junior assailant flocked around the place after picking his sword up like a frightened little bird. It seems that I must come up with some other way to take care of him.</p><br/><p>Slowly advancing towards his enemy, Lorist swung his sword in an elegant manner like a peacock dancing under the lights of the lamps around him to attract the opponent\u2019s attention. Without any giveaway, he slowly raised his left arm. Twang! A soft sound of a spring decompressing could be heard as a thin projectile flew out from Lorist\u2019s left sleeve without a noise towards its target.</p><br/><p>The junior assailant let out cold sweat when Lorist\u2019s attacks intensified. The cries and curses of his senior apprentice brother from afar only served to increase his anxiety. As he prepared to take on the attacks from the approaching Lorist, he felt an urge to scream out loud in frustration. It was like the roles of a Gold rank and an Iron rank had reversed between them!</p><br/><p>Lorist instantly leaped towards the junior assailant with his sword letting out a loud swishing sound as the light of the lamps reflected off its cold metal edge. Preparing to evade the flurry of attacks with no intention of parrying any whatsover, the junior assailant suddenly felt a blinding pain coming from his left foot. He quickly lowered his head to look at his leg only to discover that a thin, long black dart had buried itself into his foot and nailed him to the ground.</p><br/><p>Terrified beyond his wits as he looked at Lorist\u2019s approaching form, the junior assailant quickly begged for mercy to no avail. Lorist\u2019s longsword hit his target and broke through the Gold ranked Battle Force aura\u2019s defense with little to no resistance and with the sound of flesh being cut, the longsword dug itself deep into the assailant\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Ugh\u2026 Sh-shameless bastard\u2026\u201d groaned the junior assailant with all the energy left within his body while rolling both his eyes.</p><br/><p>Not ashamed at all for using the hidden dart, Lorist said sincerely, \u201cThanks for the compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lorist pulled out his longsword, the body of his dying opponent slumped down to the ground like a sandbag that was leaking sand. Lorist turned to his back and moved towards the grumbling and shouting senior assailant as fresh blood slowly dripped all over the floor from the tip of his sword, creating a trail of crimson in the wake of Lorist\u2019s passage.</p><br/><p>The senior assailant had taken a slash to his inner thigh. While it wasn\u2019t a lethal strike in itself, it sent waves of pain to the senior assailant and effectively decreased his mobility. That strike caused the senior assailant to stop taking Potterfang head on and circle around him instead while he waited for his junior apprentice brother to come back him up. This only served to worsen the wound as every step he took sent torrents of pain down his nerves. It wasn\u2019t surprising that he would be grumbling and cursing from all that suffering.</p><br/><p>However, Potterfang didn\u2019t look like he held up well either as his left shoulder blade and right lower abdomen looked rather bloody. However, the former injury wasn\u2019t as bad as it seemed as the cut wasn\u2019t that deep. It was a different story for his right lower abdomen however as the injury was created from a piercing attack rather than a slash. It would be bad if that strike had pierced any of his internal organs. The senior assailant also sent one light blade attack after another which caused Potterfang to parry each of them; an action that further intensified the bleeding from his right abdomen.</p><br/><p>The senior assailant stopped moving around and launched a few more ranged attacks before looking down to the injury on his thigh. He had already wrapped it with a makeshift bandage made from the cloth from his garments. Blood still leaked out from the bandage nevertheless. The assailant pulled on the bandage lightly and grimaced in pain.</p><br/><p>As Lorist slowly approached him, the senior assailant was under the impression that his younger apprentice brother had come. With his head looking downwards, he complained, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you for taking so long to take care of a mere Iron rank? Gosh! This fucking hurts! That Silver rank is a total madman. Watch out when you attack him as he\u2019ll take your attacks with his body to land a hit on you! Don\u2019t fall for\u2013 Ah! Ah! AHHH!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon raising his head, the senior assailant discovered that the figure approaching him was Lorist instead and his face paled in an instant. After stammering unintelligibly for quite a while, he finally exclaimed, \u201cWhy! Why is it you?! W-w-w-where\u2019s my junior apprentice brother?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist pointed to the back with his sword and said, \u201cHe\u2019s lying on the ground over there. He really did end up paying his life for attempting to take my arm. Well, he failed at it anyway. It\u2019s your turn now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The footsteps continued without stopping.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t come any closer\u2026\u201d said the senior assailant as he pointed his sword towards Lorist and scrambled backwards in fear. Having heard of the death of his junior, his mind was already in a chaotic state. Lorist\u2019s form slowly morphed into that of a demon king in his vision.</p><br/><p>The senior assailant retreated to the flower patch behind him before stopping and looking around. He threw his sword towards Lorist and circulated his Battle Force before stomping down to the ground and leaped, enduring the excruciating pain as he made his escape.</p><br/><p>A sharp sound reverberated through the plaza as a longsword flew through the air like a javelin and penetrated the senior assailant\u2019s back and reemerged from his front chest. The assailant let out a deafening cry as he crashed towards the flower patch in mid-jump before struggling to get up and finally exhaling his final breath. The longsword was actually Potterfang\u2019s. When he saw that the senior assailant intended to escape, he flung his longsword without thinking and collapsed on the ground afterwards.</p><br/><p>Lorist knocked the senior assailant\u2019s airborne sword away and thought that that the assailant had successfully escaped. He was surprised to discover that Potterfang had thrown his own sword and taken the senior assailant\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sword was very well launched. It was really impressive,\u201d praised Lorist as he made his way towards Potterfang quickly.</p><br/><p>Potterfang let out an unenergetic laugh as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing special. I learned back when I was in the military. Even so, I still couldn\u2019t match up to you. Even though we both fought against Gold ranks, you actually emerged unscathed and helped me fend off my enemy whereas I got a few injuries myself and only got the kill when the enemy was frightened into escaping by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist helped Potterfang up and carefully placed him on the bench before inspecting his injuries. The slash on the left shoulder blade wasn\u2019t that detrimental, however seriousness of the jab to his right lower abdomen couldn\u2019t really be determined under the poor lighting of the street lamps.</p><br/><p>Seeing Lorist so worried about his injuries, Potterfang felt moved and said weakly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve already taken that into consideration when the sword came at me. It shouldn\u2019t have injured any of my internals and will recover after resting for a month or two. I\u2019ve been hurt worse when I was in the military and still managed to survive to this day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist removed his linen undershirt and used it to wrap up Potterfang\u2019s injuries before going to check on the corpses of the assailants. He returned with two bags of money, two swords and two Gold ranked Battle Force badges.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeird, these swords are rather common but the badges have a different design compared to the ones issued by the trade union\u2026 They\u2019re pretty rare around here,\u201d said Lorist.</p><br/><p>Potterfang also nodded his head helplessly, unable to recognize where the badges were from.</p><br/><p>The two pouches of money contained more than 20 gold Fordes and 30 plus large silvers. Lorist put the gold coins and large silver coins into two different pouches and handed the one with the gold Fordes in it to Potterfang. \u201cBrother Potterfang, let\u2019s split the two pouches of coins among us. I won\u2019t hold back and will be taking the one with more coins in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lorist stuffed the bag with the gold Fordes into Potterfang\u2019s shirt pocket, Potterfang was totally stunned as he wore an expression of immense gratitude. \u201cMister Norton\u2026 You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lorist interjected and said, \u201cJust call me Locke. The moment you fought alongside me as a comrade, you\u2019ve already become my friend. And friends don\u2019t speak so formally among one another.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Potterfang\u2019s face revealed a smile. \u201cAlright, Locke. you can call me Pog. That\u2019s what my comrades in the army used to call me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Pog,\u201d replied Lorist.</p><br/><p>Sounds of horses galloping on the road could be heard. It turned out to be Reidy who drove the carriage with many people within it as well as several others holding on to the luggage racks on the roof and the back. Seven or eight people loudly rushed over with Els and Charade running at the front. They all let out a breath of relief when they saw Lorist unharmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the enemy? Did they run away?\u201d asked Charade as he breathed raggedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo they didn\u2019t. Look, they are lying down dead within the plaza,\u201d said Lorist as he pointed towards the dead bodies. \u201cDo you have any medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d said Charade as he scrambled to take the medicines out from his pockets. Els waved for Terman and the others to go inspect the corpses.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, daddy!\u201d A boy and a girl rushed over and held Potterfang\u2019s hand tightly while letting out streams of tears from their faces. This was Howard and Alisa, Potterfang\u2019s beloved children. They had been jolted awake during the carriage ride and saw that their father was no longer around. Had it not been for Charade who told them they were on their way to rescue their father, who knew how much harder they would\u2019ve cried? Nevertheless, they still burst into tears upon seeing their father\u2019s injured state.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Howard. You\u2019re a boy. You must learn to be strong and protect your sister in the future. Boys can\u2019t simply let out tears like that. Daddy\u2019s fine. It\u2019s only a couple of flesh wounds that aren\u2019t really anything to worry about,\u201d said Potterfang as he stroke both his children\u2019s heads.</p><br/><p>Charlando limped over with a cane in his hands and said, \u201cI know these two. Just this evening, they were the first to arrive at the inn and sat at a corner by themselves and drunk without talking to each other. I\u2019ve been eyeing them for quite sometime but I stopped thinking too much about them since they didn\u2019t bother the other guests. They started to leave the moment Lorist came back in after checking the carriage out and even paid the money to Louise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Charade said, \u201cDid they leave the inn early to ambush Lorist on the way? Lorist, do you have any leads from their corpses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than the money pouches they carried, there were two of these badges and nothing else. Oh, the swords they used were pretty common too,\u201d said Lorist as he tossed the two Battle Force badges over to Charade.</p><br/><p>Flipping the badges around, Charade said, \u201cThe design is indeed different from the normal ones, but I can\u2019t remember where these badges came from\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he passed the badges to Els, Charade grumbled, \u201cHey, this is your territory you know. Thank goodness Locke is fine. Otherwise, let\u2019s see how you will be able to make up for it to the rest of us. Quick, bring these two bastards\u2019 corpses away and try to see if we have any clues on where they\u2019re from.\u201d</p><br/><p>Els took the badges and said, \u201cWow, they\u2019re indeed One Star Gold ranks. I was rather skeptical when Reidy said that two Gold ranks ambushed Lorist\u2026 What\u2019s more surprising is that both of them ended up dead! Sol, Locke. You\u2019re truly a monster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Brother Pog here is injured you know. Had it not been for his help, I wouldn\u2019t have fared this well either. Help me bring him to the carriage first and send his children and him back to my house. By the way, where\u2019s Instructor Marlin?\u201d asked Lorist.</p><br/><p>Charade replied, \u201cHe\u2019s still sleeping very soundly within the carriage\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

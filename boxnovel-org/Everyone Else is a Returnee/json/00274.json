However, the key players who participated in this work, including Kim YeSeul, who supplied the mana, could clearly feel its movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water levels are decreasing rapidly. Looks like the bottom will show at any moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s increasing in size while absorbing water from all over the Earth, so the water levels will decrease as a whole.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she had finished the magic formation, there was nothing for Kim YeSeul to do. They immediately left the lake and stood on land. Even while they did that, the magic formation\u2019s expansion was happening non-stop, and Yu IlHan was still focusing on the magic formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt only just covered Gangnam. No, it\u2019s Seoul now. And Gyeongi-do\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s expanding at a rapid rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well, the amount of water it\u2019s absorbing will increase as time goes. Whoaa, how fun. Can you feel a part of the magic formation we\u2019ve created being etched into this country?]</p><br/><p>He focused his consciousness on the Will of the Guardian. No matter how far apart they were, as long as its foundation was a thought-soul, it was possible for Yu IlHan to communicate with it.</p><br/><p>[There are no problems.]</p><br/><p>\u2018Something always happens to those that are overly confident. Be careful and concentrate.\u2019</p><br/><p>The magic formation beyond Korea and to Japan and China. The golem froze its body solid and was implementing the magic formation at rapid speeds.</p><br/><p>Sharing its senses, Yu IlHan felt like his head was exploding, but he suppressed the pain. He still had one more thing to do.</p><br/><p>[The mana of Earth is resisting violently, darling. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be obediently trapped under the magic formation.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI predicted that much. But it\u2019s not like the magic formation is the only card I prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>The millions of dragon bone pillars that Yu IlHan had created. The trigger that activated them was in Yu IlHan\u2019s hand in the form of a pendant.</p><br/><p>It was none other than a remote-control that he had created using the principles of resonance that once appeared in the Thunder hammer! The pendant that had Teraka\u2019s skull as the base, and was decorated with his eyes, had a frighteningly strong magic power, and was flashing dangerously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pendant has the abilities to both suck the surrounding mana, and the power to resonate with artifacts made of the same materials. And those that belong to a special network of artifacts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo to put it simply, it\u2019s like setting a channel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he gripped on the pendant to activate it, the pendant sucked the surrounding mana and at the same time, gave a command to millions of artifacts scattered over Earth \u2013 to suck the mana of Earth and send it to Dareu!</p><br/><p>However, even Erta and Kim YeSeul couldn\u2019t possibly feel something of a global scale, so the only one that could shiver in excitement at the destructive results that occurred from a light motion was Heli\u00e8na.</p><br/><p>[Oh my, my god. How can\u2026\u2026. Aah, wonderful.]</p><br/><p>She even felt a sense of bliss when the millions of artifacts simultaneously sucked the mana and made it disappear. Although a lot of preparation was needed, controlling the mana of a world with a single gesture made Yu IlHan look like the Supreme being that ruled over numerous worlds!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Hm? I suddenly feel like I\u2019ve lost my vitality a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just \u2018a little\u2019. I feel that my shoulders are light as well. The mana concentration is definitely lowering.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the concentration of mana started being lowered for real, Kim YeSeul and Erta also felt something and tilted their heads. Yu IlHan made a small smile at them and focused more. The millions of artifacts had successfully activated, so this was the perfect moment for the magic formation to act now that the mana covering Earth had become weaker!</p><br/><p>[Good!]</p><br/><p>The Will of the Guardian voiced out. The golem that already spread to three continents once again sucked the water of Earth to become bigger, and pierced the Earth\u2019s crust to cover the entire Earth!</p><br/><p>[I will envelop everything!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really does suit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master really is cruel.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing new.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan closed his eyes and thought up of the figure of Earth in his head. The magic formation that was perfectly designed by Kim YeSeul, Erta, and Heli\u00e8na was completed into a perfectly spherical magic formation that covered the Earth.</p><br/><p>[The magic.]</p><br/><p>Feelings the end of its body meeting another end at the other side of Earth, achieving its purpose, the Will of the Guardian voiced out with deep emotion.</p><br/><p>[Activates.]</p><br/><p>At that moment, everything on Earth became slower.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Wow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan barely managed to say that out loud. As he had made everything on Earth slower than usual, Yu IlHan was also naturally affected by the magic formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is crazy. It\u2019s like training just by being here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTraining? Ordinary lower existences wouldn\u2019t even be able to move in such an environment! Han YeoRang! We need to go check up on them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Screamed Erta. Even she was feeling difficulties in moving despite the fact that she had gained insights into the manipulation of space and time thanks to working with Kim YeSeul, AND even though she had activated a magic on herself to resist it! The other lower existences wouldn\u2019t even be able to move!</p><br/><p>However, someone denied her opinion, and it was none other than the caster of the magic, Kim YeSeul herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything on Earth has become slower, so the speed of external stimulation and the internal processing speed would equally be slowed down. So Erta, your words implying that lower existences cannot move are wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meaning, they were only moving slowly in the views of people that were aware of the slowness due to the magic formation, and the people themselves wouldn\u2019t feel a thing. In other words\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, we are already resisting against this magic. And it\u2019s difficult because we\u2019re trying to ignore the slowed time on Earth and are trying to move as fast as usual. \u2026\u2026And tremendously quickly to boot.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t remember when the last time he sweated was, but even Yu IlHan was sweating right now. Right now, he felt like he was moving slightly slower than usual, considering that the Earth had slowed down, he was moving really fast!</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s it, darling. Darling\u2019s movement speeds should have decreased more than normal, no?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026. This is really nothing new, but we really are in a situation where science can go screw itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he had to realize that from the moment Earth was stopped by God, this time, it was his own doing.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan once again thought that he was not ordinary. Of course, this applied more to the crux of this matter, his mother. Perhaps the Fifth they were talking about would not be him, but his mother?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s two birds with one stone. The ones that cannot notice this magic will just move normally, while we, resisting against the magic, are training even while we do nothing. Hm, perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I understand that you\u2019re a total pervert!\u201d</p><br/><p>[However, the magic could not be more perfect. The golem called the Will of the Guardian too\u2026\u2026 yes, has been placed well. Now that the magic formation is complete, not only are there very few ways to damage it, even if it does get destroyed\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can be restored if it just absorbs more water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan made a smirk. Although he was sweating a lot due to resisting against the power of the magic formation, his smirk could not be more evil.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen such a perfect magic formation. No one could have done this in reality.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can praise me more at times like these.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ufufu.]</p><br/><p>Boasted Yu IlHan, unlike his usual self. Heli\u00e8na giggled since she thought Yu IlHan was adorable, and Erta didn\u2019t like Heli\u00e8na\u2019s smile and only stomped on the ground with her shoes.</p><br/><p>At that moment, there were presences of those that tried to enter Earth. Unless it was the leaders of each faction, the only one that can enter the closed-off Earth was Kang MiRae. Of course, Yu IlHan knew that it was her and did not activate the Ruler of Dimensions skill.</p><br/><p>[It seems like they\u2019ve sensed your presence and are coming here\u2026\u2026 oh, they\u2019re here.]</p><br/><p>[Uaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>As soon as Heli\u00e8na\u2019s words ended, Mystic\u2019s shouts hit everyone\u2019s ear drums. Of course, they knew why she was screaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome back, Mystic.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Masteeeeeeeeeeeeer! Just what did you do to Earth!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI made everything go slower.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t say such an absurd thing so calmly! Don\u2019t reply to me so calmly!]</p><br/><p>Even while speaking like a machine gun, Mystic\u2019s movements were very careful. The reason was simple \u2013 some people on board the Flying fortress could not recognize the effects of the magic formation.</p><br/><p>A tragedy would occur if Mystic moved fast while they were moving slowly! She was really wise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWwwwwwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan found a figure of someone that was trying to shout something very slowly.</p><br/><p>The identity of this guy, that had become very strong, but was still 3rd class, was Michael Smithson, the leader of Metal Knights, one of the pivots of the Front Line Alliance, as well as the most elite guild in England.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissssssssssssssstteeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrr.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddamn.\u201d</p><br/><p>But he was too slow. Moving his lips moving so slowly, Yu IlHan subconsciously gripped his fist. He wanted to smack this guy on the face! Even though he knew that this guy had done nothing wrong!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like I should give up on conversing with this guy under the effects of the magic formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can converse with him if you give up resisting against the magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to converse with him to the point that I have to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy son, you\u2019re quite cold\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was set beforehand that Mystic would be the one that would transport the members of the Front Line Alliance, as Yu IlHan\u2019s party members all resisted against the effects of the magic formation and jumped down. Yu IlHan caught Yumir who came down first and patted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, you\u2019re holding out well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, dad! I feel like I\u2019m training just by standing here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of father and son, they said the exact same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHaaaaaaaan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, is this that magic? I thought you were planning to do it later, but you did it already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Fuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta made a surprised expression after seeing quite a few members resisting against the magic formation and not just Na YuNa, Liera and Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that a lower existence is resisting this magic formation in the first place. Yu IlHan, this means that the ones by your side are all unusual.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, if they were normal, they wouldn\u2019t have held out until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan gave a chic reply to Erta, and laughed when he saw the members that gathered around him. He ignored Liera and Heli\u00e8na having a staring contest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s around a week left, so please do your best until then. Let\u2019s meet again after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne week left until what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was about to reply that it was the cool-down time of the Hourglass of Eternity, but thought up of something and took it out. The hourglass was still flipped, indicating that it could not be used. Once all the sand fell to the bottom, he would be able to activate it again.</p><br/><p>But\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike usual, the sand particles fell at very slow speeds. Of course, as this was a God-ranked artifact, it was resisting against the magic formation, but at this rate, they wouldn\u2019t be able to use it even after one month passed, not to mention one week. However, this also indicated one other fact\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will be interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, he has an evil smile again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUu, that smile is so cool\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[My, ex-angel. We agree on one thing at least.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked forward to the time he could activate the barrier again and made an evil smirk.</p><br/><p>Perhaps a profit he had never expected, and one that was huge, maybe waiting for him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

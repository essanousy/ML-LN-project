What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan blinked twice or three times before realizing what situation he was in. Yumir and his subordinates were growing rather rapidly at this moment!</p><br/><p>Hurriedly checking his own status, Yu IlHan found out it wasn\u2019t only the Rule skill, but Dragon-man resonance and Dragonic blood that had also risen in level.</p><br/><p>Mir was alive. And he was growing! Pretty quickly as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought the world was closed off\u2026.. so it\u2019s still in contact with the Akashic Record?\u201d</p><br/><p>If not, there was no way Yu IlHan\u2019s own record would be updates just because of their growth. Thinking up to there, Yu IlHan hurriedly checked his Rule skill.</p><br/><p>To be exact, he was checking the status of his subordinates through it, and that method came back as a nice success.</p><br/><p>[Subordinates connected through Rule skill : Yumir, Mirey, Pate, Jirl, Phiria, Ericia]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Good, they\u2019re all alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>A small sigh of relief. If they were all alive, he could probably say that the others were safe as well. Although he didn\u2019t know when they could meet again, he was relieved that they were still alive.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since the forces on that side should have been weakened due to the battle on Earth, they should be able to endure well. Definitely.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know that less than 10% came out of the gate, but for now, not knowing was better for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that his worry for Yumir and co died down, a sense of hunger came with it.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to sit up from his bed while loathing his own body for being true to his desires, he found out that he couldn\u2019t move due to Liera sticking to him.</p><br/><p>[Uuuuuum. Ehi, Uhuhu.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEeei, this failure of an angel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan freed himself from Liera\u2019s arms and legs which were coiled around his chest and leg respectively, before rolling this embarrassing angel that had stuck to him in her sleep.</p><br/><p>It seemed that she had clung to him for ages, as her scent seemed to linger on his body. He had to put in quite a lot of effort in order to calm down his red face.</p><br/><p>No matter how close they were\u2026 sometimes, he didn\u2019t know how Liera thought of him from her actions. Sighing lightly, he stood up and stretched himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s eat and cheer up. Was what he thought as he opened his inventory when\u2026</p><br/><p>[The skill, Rule, has become level 31 due to the growth of your subordinates.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The skill rose just now, but it levelled up again? Just how many monsters were they facing? He blinked again in shock.</p><br/><p>However, the skill growth didn\u2019t end with just that. After he ate lunch, after he finished his smithing at night, even as he laid down to sleep! Just as he was about to forget, the skill level of Rule rose and never once failed to make Yu IlHan dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t it possible if you think that they are killing 100 3rd class monsters in 1 second? You have 6 subordinates so 16 each per second\u2026.. Hm, it\u2019s impossible if it\u2019s not IlHan huh.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also impossible for me without the remote collection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, not to mention remote collection, the ones that went to another world didn\u2019t even have an inventory. Just what was happening to them? Of course, there was no way of knowing. He could only ask once they met up!</p><br/><p>His everyday life without Yumir and the other subordinates made him think back to his dropout period. As there were no other angels than Liera, it reminded him even more of that period.</p><br/><p>Was it due to that? He also felt that time was flowing faster as well.</p><br/><p>[They are all in a mess talking about the 2nd Great Cataclysm.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cVanguard\u2019s popularity is rising as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The day of the battle against the Abandoned World, Yu IlHan had mentioned the 2nd Great Cataclysm, and the effect was huge.</p><br/><p>The people of Earth were scared stiff after knowing that this already chaotic Earth would become even more chaotic, as they wished to raise their power and sense of security by several notches. As such, they all wished to trade with Vanguard, whose weapons showed amazing might in both personal weapons and install-style weapons.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were many people that wanted to surpass Vanguard. Many companies thought that they could surpass Vanguard by fusing Earthen weapon development techniques and the weapon crafting skills of the Akashic Record, but that matter wasn\u2019t as easily done as said.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside nuclear bombs and hydrogen bombs that easily killed numerous humans prior to killing monsters, chemical and biological weapons that showed enormous might in wars between human beings did not work against monsters at all.</p><br/><p>Going over to firearms, pistols only worked against 1st classes, and heavy arms could barely defeat a 2nd class. And this was assuming that the monsters stood still and got their weak points struck.</p><br/><p>There were many problems as well in regards to non-nuclear explosive warheads; small-scale warheads were useless, and bigger scale warheads caused human deaths as well. moreover, the monsters had a much higher resistance to all kinds of gunpowder.</p><br/><p>Decisively, even missiles that flew at over mach 10 would be useless unless it exploded right in front of the monsters\u2019 faces and the majority could avoid them so large scale weapons were mostly useless.</p><br/><p>Since things came to there, mankind turned their eyes into new materials that Earth had acquired due to the Great Cataclysm, but there was no way creating new weapons with new materials, was easy.</p><br/><p>If so, who on Earth was able to do all that? Yes, there was only Vanguard! As such, the more they failed, the higher Vanguard\u2019s name rose.</p><br/><p>[Vanguard makes weapons by extorting aliens]</p><br/><p>Was how people joked around after the battle with the Abandoned World. As weapons that couldn\u2019t be seen even in other worlds, not to mention Earth, were popping out one after the other, it was natural for such things to be said. While in truth, it was all thanks to high level monster materials, Eternal Flame, and the max levelled blacksmithing!</p><br/><p>On the 3rd day after Yumir and co were swept into the Abandoned World, Yu IlHan had safely undergone the 2nd advanced weapons trade, and became a globally wealthy man.</p><br/><p>As he had overflowing amount of cash, in this trade, he didn\u2019t only trade with cash, but with monster materials from those over 2nd class, buildings or land. But after he did receive it, it was a pain to manage all of them so he left them all alone. They weren\u2019t that important to Yu IlHan anyway.</p><br/><p>It was also then that he met up with Kang HaJin.</p><br/><p>After the advanced weapons trade was over, the two headed to a clearing in Gangnam; the place where the gate connecting to Kiroa, the home of the wolves, was located.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin made a bitter smile. But even this was better than before. When they met in New York, he was so absent minded that he couldn\u2019t even call out to him. No, well, to be exact, it should be said that Yu IlHan also wasn\u2019t in the mind to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t stay still forever\u2026\u2026 If it was MiRae or YuNa in my place, they would have also done this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instead of saying something irresponsible like \u2018since my subordinates are alive, it\u2019s possible that your friend and sister might be alive as well\u2019, he silently listened to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the transference of land possession was completed smoothly, I was about to talk about it to you. And before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin bowed his head towards Yu IlHan in apology.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yu IlHan\u2019s subordinates were caught up in this due to my sister. I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be, it was their own decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin also relaxed a little at Yu IlHan\u2019s honest reply. \u2018Is that so?\u2019 he asked before stepping back a little and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the monsters you are ruling were also caught up in this. Although I\u2019m sorry to ask this, can we still believe in those wolves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, of course they\u2019d leave my control if Ericia dies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf so\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take responsibility for everything, so you don\u2019t need to worry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you, and I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was probably what he wanted to hear in the first place. Yu IlHan pitied Kang HaJin as he had to act like this since his sister was swept into an Abandoned World, it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t understand him at all, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Kang HaJin opened his mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask one more thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any plans on what you\u2019re going to do on this land here? If there\u2019s anything we can help you with\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. I do have something to do, but I will not be needing your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Yu IlHan as he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to build a house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA house\u2026\u2026 you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m building one, I\u2019m planning to make a big mansion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin\u2019s face colored in confusion and doubt. Meanwhile, Yu IlHan\u2019s smile became thicker. He spoke with strong conviction and expectation.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore they come back, I\u2019m planning to build a grand mansion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was good to build a mansion, there was something else he had to make before that.</p><br/><p>Which was, of course, the item that he even created a blueprint for while \u2018running\u2019 towards South America, wings! The wings with thousands or tens of thousands of thin feathers would become a perfect support type equipment that helps out in regard to battle, defense, and even mobility.</p><br/><p>In fact, he was planning to craft it using dragon bones when he drew the blueprint, but after acquiring the level 267 volcanic demon beast corpse, his plan changed. To be specific, he changed his mind after finding a 4th class magic stone near its heart while dismantling it.</p><br/><p>[Wow, this is really amazing\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Even Liera exclaimed after looking at that. The magic stone emitted a mysterious light, and was so big that it was unbelievable that it came out from a lower existence! Leaving aside the fact that vicious poison and curse dwelled in it, and was hard to even hold onto it, the magic stone was the manifestation of perfection itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I shall create the wings with this guy\u2019s magic stone and bones.\u201d</p><br/><p>[How about creating a weapon since the magic stone is this good?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s start!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hey! Don\u2019t ignore me!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Although he did decide after only looking at its heart, its bones were the best as well. its blackish-red bones from skull to toe bones made him wonder what it must have eaten for it to become so hard.</p><br/><p>If there was one drawback, it was that not to mention processing, even cutting it was very difficult. Although the demon beast\u2019s bones were metallic like the dragons, perhaps due to its ability while it was living, it had a perverse characteristic of absorbing fire up to a certain level, and even became even harder through it.</p><br/><p>As even Eternal Flame couldn\u2019t melt it down no matter how many magic stones he fed it, he called out the purple flames from his Eight-tailed dragon spear, added Blaze, and covered that with the Eternal Flame and fused them into one. Only then could he barely melt it down. As Yu IlHan himself had no mana potions, this process was very tiring.</p><br/><p>The It was impossible to completely melt down the demon beast\u2019s bones, and even if it did melt, it solidified almost instantly, so Yu IlHan had to craft the artifact with the mindset, and actions of that of a beast aiming for prey.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s carving knife, hammer, chisel and anvil all perfectly harmonized with each other to craft the demon beast\u2019s bones little by little. That scene, was really, was so cool that it was a little bit of a pity for Liera alone to watch it. As Liera liked watching Yu IlHan holding the hammer the most from before, this period of time was like a blessing to her.</p><br/><p>Of course, she couldn\u2019t just play around. She had to support him in the process.</p><br/><p>[IlHan, that place is solidifying!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>[There, a little below! It\u2019s sticking!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle that was even more difficult than killing the demon beast itself, continued for almost three days before it ended. Exactly 7,867 blade feathers and the skeleton frame that connected all of them, were completed.</p><br/><p>[Wow, so pretty. Does this move only with your shoulder movements?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan equipped the wings behind his back, and when he tensed his back and shoulder muscles minutely, the wings made of bladed feathers flapped while creating sharp and frightening sounds. He had implemented it so it could move just with physical power and not mana.</p><br/><p>Of course, that technique itself was very amazing, but Yu IlHan\u2019s ability to freely flex all of his muscles was more shocking.</p><br/><p>[Are you able to fly now?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I could probably control the direction if I\u2019m falling from the sky, no matter how hard I flap these heavy wings on the ground, it does nothing more than training back muscles.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That doesn\u2019t sound so bad to me. Slurp.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>The current wings were already a legend ranked artifact. If he moved his shoulder muscles and back muscles well, it was possible to attack towards his back direction with the wings while attacking the front with his weapon. The attack power amounted to 7,000 purely as a weapon!</p><br/><p>However, what Yu IlHan wanted wasn\u2019t simply a weapon. He wanted a supportive tool for perfecting his rapid movements that had the Leap skill as its base.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I want to do that, I need to engrave each and every one of these feathers with magic language. I\u2019m talking about these extremely sturdy feathers.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uh, yeah\u2026.. do your best\u2026..!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>As such, this was the 2nd round now. With all types of flames available to him, Yu IlHan started engraving on the wings.</p><br/><p>Had he not acquired the \u2018Hero of fire\u2019 title that increased his fire attribute attack by 40%, the fire output would have decreased, and it would have been impossible to craft these wings!</p><br/><p>\u201cDone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had spent another 3 days before he could let the carving knife go. Looking at the magic formation that was completed through a work process that was incomparably more difficult to creating the Traps of Destruction, a smile surfaced on his face subconsciously.</p><br/><p>However, the most important process in order to finish the job, was still left.</p><br/><p>[Are you really going to use that magic stone?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already extracted the options from the robe, so yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took a few deep breaths, and grabbed the 4th class magic stone that the demon beast left behind. As the magic stone\u2019s power was overwhelmingly stronger than the option\u2019s power, it should be possible to create new options that Yu IlHan wanted! It had to be able to!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan delicately put down the magic stone on the blade feathered-wings, and put his two hands on it before closing both of his eyes. It was now time to undergo mana crafting.</p><br/><p>What he imaged was the strong and fast figure of the demon beast. The figure of the demon beast that was apocalyptic with just its presence alone! Yu IlHan did not doubt at all that that power would be imbued into these set of wings and help Yu IlHan in the future.</p><br/><p>At the same time he thought up of the form of the completed artifact, a heavy and dark light covered the workshop. However, a streak of bright light burst out.</p><br/><p>[Ruin Calling was completed.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Mana crafting, has become level 60. You can bring out the power of the artifact with less mana.]</p><br/><p>The moment that messaged popped on Yu IlHan\u2019s retina, he was sure that he had succeeded.</p><br/><p>[Ruin Calling]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Epic]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013 7,300]</p><br/><p>[Defense \u2013 6,500]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 15,500/15,500]</p><br/><p>[User restrictions \u2013 Hero of Fire, Physical combat mastery level MAX]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013</p><br/><p>1. All blades that make up the wings have a strong power of fire dwelling in them. All flames are absorbed within the limits of the durability, and can freely be released.</p><br/><p>2. Reduces the activation speed for all physical combat-class skills, and increases their effect by 30%.</p><br/><p>3. Creates a shockwave into a set direction by consuming mana. The power of the shockwave is directly proportional to the mana consumed.]</p><br/><p>[A miracle created by the best smith using the best materials that could come out of a lower world.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Huh?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera tilted her head.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s really amazing that it\u2019s epic-ranked\u2026\u2026 but isn\u2019t this just a weapon that\u2019s stuck onto the back?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did the second option go?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Exactly! It\u2019s a physical combat skill enhancement! It\u2019s a perfect weapon!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that Superhuman strength is also categorized as a physical combat skill?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uh, what?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Superhuman strength was physical combat-class, and of course, Leap was the same. These wings, Ruin Calling, would increase the performance of his leap skill by 30% just by equipping it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, adding the 3rd option that was a strengthened version of the robe\u2019s options, Yu IlHan\u2019s speed would multiply by 3 times or more!</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get it until I see for myself. So let\u2019s first\u2026.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>The moment Liera was about to say that due to not realizing the true power of the wings, Spiera\u2019s hurried voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>[Come to New York quickly with Yu IlHan! The Gate seems like it\u2019s about to open!] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Liera abruptly raised his head and grabbed onto Yu IlHan\u2019s arm. Regardless of his reaction, she dragged him and expanded her wings.</p><br/><p>[IlHan, let\u2019s use those wings right now. Let\u2019s go!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cWha, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Right now!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wings! I should take them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten days had passed since Yumir and co were swept into an Abandoned World.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Although he couldn\u2019t build a mansion, the wings are complete! We\u2019re going to meet them now!</p><br/><p>There was a lot of mentions that IlHan\u2019s level up speed was much slower than Yumir and co\u2019s levelling speed. I was about to write about how Yumir and co\u2019s levelling speed is reasonable in the author notes, and was about to exceed a chapter\u2019s amount, but deleted them all. I should have made you accept it just with the novel alone, but it\u2019s my fault that I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m very sorry.</p><br/><p>I resolved to myself that I will only give you enjoyment while you read my story, but some of you are feeling inconvenient rather than joyful. I\u2019m sorry yet again.</p><br/><p>Although I can\u2019t fix their levels since Yumir and co\u2019s journey in another world is necessary for plot development, I\u2019ll try to write more carefully in the future while considering experience balance.

Yu IlHan spoke with a voice that was neither loud nor soft, to the ones who were looking at him including his mother and his son.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you can feel right now, the growth speed of Earth is very, tremendously, a little annoyingly\u2026\u2026 fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded their heads. It hadn\u2019t been long since Earth experienced its 3rd Great Cataclysm, but the concentration of mana on Earth was thicker than most worlds after the 4th Great Cataclysm.</p><br/><p>And the concentration of mana was becoming thicker right now as well. From the moment the hell dungeon, where all sorts of demons roamed about, was fused completely with Earth, its growth had accelerated even further. The 4th class monsters which were once considered disaster-level, could now be seen frequently if you walked about.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, I tried to accelerate the growth speed of Earth. I wanted to give the privilege of returning to Earth for the people of Earth currently residing in other worlds. However, it worked a little too well, and from the current state of things\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this rate, Earth would enter the realm of higher worlds in a few years, and the seal on Earth will be lifted, allowing the people of Earth to come back, though, they would be wiped out by the horrifying monsters of Earth. This was the perfect situation of \u2018too much is worse than too little\u2019.</p><br/><p>So, he needed to tweak his plans slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are two major things we have to do. First is to slow down the growth of Earth, and I think I can solve this to an extent with the artifact I designed and will create with the help of the mages here. I\u2019m also going to activate the Hourglass of Eternity whenever possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is about slowing down the growth of an entire world, but you\u2019re saying it like it\u2019s no hard job, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI accelerated the growth like without much difficulty so, it\u2019s nothing new to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t familiar with magic before, but right now, he had exceptional mages on his side with Kim YeSeul, Kang MiRae and Erta. Although it was annoying to talk to her, Heli\u00e8na was also superb in her abilities. He had the confidence to succeed if it was with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second is to form and raise as much battle force as possible before Earth becomes a higher world. Only like that could we able to defend against any invaders. One of the forces is the Dragon\u2019s Army and\u2026\u2026 from now, I\u2019m planning to go around various worlds connected to the people of Earth to procure allies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear, IlHan said he\u2019ll actually look for allies of his own accord\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t look at me like a child debuting at a playground!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the biggest forces, Kim YeSeul, was quite difficult for Yu IlHan to act against. Yu IlHan retorted to the best of his abilities to his touched mother and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, it will be impossible to visit all worlds that the people of Earth were scattered to. First, I\u2019m planning to search the ones belonging to the Front Line Alliance first. Fortunately, that will become a lot easier thanks to Miss MiRae acquiring an ability to move across worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae\u2019s expression immediately darkened as she had predicted what his answer was. However, Yu IlHan was merciless and continued speaking without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to split up the members. I will be on the Guardian fortress, and Miss MiRae will be on the Flying fortress. For concealment, Mir will also be on the Flying fortress, and as for the rest, you will be suitably split up between the two\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan said up to that point, a fierce battle of wits started. A war-like psychological warfare! As if to pour cold water on all of them, Yu IlHan took out a piece of paper.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026fortresses as I\u2019ve listed according to level and class on this paper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan won\u2019t always be done in. Everyone looked at Yu IlHan as if they\u2019ve been betrayed, but he did not allow for any objections or arguments.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan made all members that had reached 4th class other than Heli\u00e8na and Kim YeSeul onto Kang MiRae\u2019s side, and he forcefully proceeded with it despite Liera\u2019s strong protests.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take care of any danger, Liera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgggggggh. I\u2019m fine with everyone else but why are you taking that succubus!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh my, miss ex-angel is quite worried, eh?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na smirked at Liera when she protested. Her leisurely smile made Liera even more angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I am! Why do I go with Kang MiRae but you take that succbus!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Do I really have to put it into words? It\u2019s obviously because my darling likes\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because the very existence of this thing is a bomb so only I can treat it with caution. And since Heli\u00e8na and I are here, I can only put the majority of the rest with Miss MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan told her the cold and hard truth in place of Heli\u00e8na\u2019s teasing. Heli\u00e8na pouted since she was treated like a ticking bomb.</p><br/><p>[You should have just said you wanted to protect me. Darling really is embarrassed.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll depart like this. Oh, before that, communication devices.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan distributed new communication devices. Although it didn\u2019t look that much different from before, the aura inside it provoked a few ex-angels.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, this is\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe angel\u2019s ring!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Liera was about to say something, Erta shouted instead. Yu IlHan only gleefully smiled at the two shocked angels.</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find a better alternative to send intentions through dimensions. Thanks to that, we can call each other however and whenever we want even if we\u2019re in different dimensions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu IlHan, you should really learn what consideration is\u2026\u2026 uuuu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm, it does nag me a little, but I guess it\u2019s fine since I can talk to IlHan even when we\u2019re far apart\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I can\u2019t accept this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Things were wrong since he started using dragon made equipment when he was with a dragon, Yumir. Liera thought \u2018it\u2019s fine since we\u2019ve already come this far\u2019, but Erta still couldn\u2019t accept it. Yu IlHan licked his lips and extended his hand towards Erta.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you give it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta pondered for a moment, but she still put the communication device in her bosom in the end. Reality always required one to look away even when you know something. This was such a moment. Yu IlHan laughed and cleared up the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll depart immediately. I guess it should be better if Miss MiRae and the others check up on your own families first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your consideration. We shall do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must at least give me a comm three times a day. Aside from that, please tell me whenever something arises as well. I\u2019ll immediately go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, I\u2019ll kill you if you cheat on me! I\u2019ll know with the blessing of the god of love!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeedless worry, you\u2019re the only one for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group split up. The reason he left the Flying fortress was of course because the gear was better in the Flying fortress, and also because Mystic could control it of her own accord even without him around. The Flying fortress is originally supposed to be under the control of the Flying fortress, but it also had the function to be operated by Yu IlHan if needed be, so there were no problems.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where are you planning to go first, son?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Kang MiRae and co. going over the gate on the Flying fortress, Kim YeSeul asked her son. Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to gather the people with the most responsibility I know of, at the same time being as strong as the elite guilds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs strong as the elite guilds? Even though you told all of us that you\u2019d gather them first, the first target isn\u2019t a guild?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, these guys are the only exceptions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people he was referring to was none other than the proud strong friends of Korea, Suppression! If they, who maintained their places to protect the citizens even while being treated poorly by the country, there was no need to doubt about their personalities.</p><br/><p>The second criterion of his judgement was of course, battle capability, and until the moment the 3rd Great Cataclysm arrived, Suppression had levels and skills that didn\u2019t lose out to any other 1st rate guilds, so there was no need to worry about that either. And most decisively,</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppression are relatively cohesive in regards to which troops they are from. So I only have to go around 14 worlds to collect them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2018only\u2019 14 worlds, huh? Ufufu.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na giggled when she heard Yu IlHan\u2019s nonchalant words.</p><br/><p>[It really is surprising. Until now, there was no lower existence that could leap through dimensions like that, you know? But somehow, TWO such miraculous beings were born in the small world known as Earth. How did that happen?]</p><br/><p>He shrugged his shoulders and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it was destined the moment humankind of Earth was scattered throughout other worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fufu, it really is interesting to be with you, darling. I think it\u2019s gonna be much more fun in the future too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, it will be sooo interesting, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnjoying everything is a good thing, son. If you don\u2019t get into danger because of it, that is.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh my, you understand me, huh?]</p><br/><p>The Heaven\u2019s Army, the Army of Brilliant Light, the Destruction Demon Army, the Garden of Sunset \u2013 just thinking about them made him sick but \u2018interesting\u2019?</p><br/><p>Of course, it was a good thing that he had made her, who can treat all that as \u2018interesting\u2019, into an ally, but he would only make a loss if he was swept by her thoughts and emotions. This was also why he put Kim YeSeul into his group. As long as his mother was with him, he had the confidence to maintain his calm state.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s look for their big guy first then. I really hope he is still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, you\u2019ve become strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, though, I feel a little sad because I feel like I\u2019m becoming numb to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan immediately activated Warp. His destination was the world Midora, where Colonel Yoon DaeHan and 39 of his subordinates were residing in. This was a world he looked for the first time, but as he had come into contact with the colonel several times, finding that world and recording it was not such a difficult thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis word is a 2nd\u2026\u2026 No, a 3rd?\u201d</p><br/><p>Estimated Yu IlHan when he arrived at Midora successfully, and saw the concentration of mana in the air. Since he had experienced so many worlds, this much was nothing much to him now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is a different world. Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, mom. I don\u2019t think we have the time to leisurely go around touring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how are you planning to find them all when it\u2019s not just one or two that we\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Kim YeSeul asked in confusion, Yu IlHan raised a hand with a faint smile. Invisible magic power flowed out from his hand and came into contact with the world, when his Record skill activated and started reading the world.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Just now, what did you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh my\u2026\u2026 I think I\u2019m falling for you all over again, darling.]</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul was surprised after seeing the absurd ability of the Record skill up close, and the Succubus Queen Heli\u00e8na made a thick smile. Not so long after, Yu IlHan severed the flow of magic power from his hand and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you say you just found them all? All 40 of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c5 of them died, but yeah. They are together as I predicted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Kim YeSeul renewed her evaluation of her son\u2019s capabilities, Yu IlHan activated Warp again to the place where Colonel Yoon DaeHan was battling with his subordinates.</p><br/><p>[Kroaaaaaaaaaar!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t retreat. It\u2019s aiming for that opening!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t kill this. It\u2019s impossible for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can! The reason we\u2019ve crawled into this forest is right in front of us. We can do it if we don\u2019t give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Battling a 4th class giant snake of level 230, the soldiers shouted all sorts of things. At that place, there were other people than just the soldiers, but Yu IlHan could immediately recognize who belonged to Suppression; they were still using the artifacts that Yu IlHan made.</p><br/><p>[What are you planning to do with those humans that are struggling against such a trash, darling?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably have a hard time believing, but they are within the top 0.0001% of Earth with their abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh my, can we really defend a higher world with those scrubs?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan snorted at her and took out a dragon bone spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make them all into 4th class before Earth becomes a higher world, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he threw it lightly without thinking much about it.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>The thrown spear fell like a comet from the air and pinned the body of the snake onto the ground. When the snake struggled while scattering green blood everywhere, the ones that were prepared to receive an attack from it were all put at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did this attack come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, look at the sky! The sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Yu IlHan avoided hitting the vitals of the snake on purpose, the snake was put half to death. Anyway, it didn\u2019t die instantly so the figure of the Guardian fortress was revealed, and the people doubted what they were seeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cColonel Yoon DaeHan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Preparing to jump down from the Guardian fortress with his Ruin Calling open, Yu IlHan shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back with me to protect Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reply unexpectedly arrived quite soon. It seemed like Yoon DaeHan realized that the owner of the spear was Yu IlHan the moment he saw it on the snake.</p><br/><p>But anyway, \u2018no\u2019? He wasn\u2019t supposed to reject so easily. Just as when Yu IlHan tilted his head and was about to shout again, Yoon DaeHan shouted in a confident and strong voice towards the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was promoted a little more while I was still on Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the moment when \u2018Major-General\u2019 Yoon DaeHan and his 35 subordinates joined the Earth defense force.</p><br/><p>Needless to say, this was merely the beginning.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

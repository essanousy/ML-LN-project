Yu IlHan\u2019s attack power would increase by 40% due to his concealment passive effect because of his armor and his class, and coincidentally, he had the pile bunker with an enormous attack power right now.</p><br/><p>The numbers weren\u2019t funny. Didn\u2019t he experience its destructive power several times already? It didn\u2019t look impossible if he did well.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut right now, it\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s also impossible for me right now to raise my strength so there\u2019s only one thing I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>[And that is?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta thought about it for a little. Of course, the conclusion came out not long after.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s mana crafting, isn\u2019t it?]</p><br/><p>Correct. Yu IlHan was planning to use mana crafting on the pile bunker and the full plate armor. It might be insufficient with just that, so he was planning to go through a special modification on the pile bunker.</p><br/><p>For that modification process, there was a need to sacrifice the 3rd class magic stone in his possession.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it came to this, I should give up on evolving the resting skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You just managed to fulfill all the requirements, and it comes to this.]</p><br/><p>Somehow, Erta looked more disappointed than Yu IlHan himself, so he quietly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Even if you say it\u2019s the evolved version of the resting skill, it\u2019s not a battle-oriented skill, right? So, it\u2019s better for me to finish advancing to my 2nd class first and somehow acquire another 3rd class monster\u2019s magic stone, before evolving it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re right. That\u2019s the reasonable logic. I was just a little disappointed.]</p><br/><p>Mana crafting was originally doable without a magic stone. The reason why Yu IlHan needed to use magic stones in mana crafting was only because he had no ability to wield mana.</p><br/><p>However, separate from that, it was also true that the effect of mana crafting would increase if one used a magic stone.</p><br/><p>Just the difference between using a 1st class monster\u2019s magic stone and a 2nd class monster\u2019s magic stone alone was huge already, how amazing would the effect be if he were to use a 3rd class monster\u2019s magic stone?</p><br/><p>To increase his probability of succeeding the quest, Yu IlHan could delay evolving something like a resting skill without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re going into work straight away, eh.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry so I should eat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I knew it\u2026\u2026 I really did know you would say that!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan gathered firewood quite proficiently, scattered troll fat, and ignited them. He suitably chopped the troll meat to bite sized pieces, skewering them on a metal skewer, before he left them on the fire. Then, a fragrant smell could be smelled soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite proficient in my cooking skill now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Although it\u2019s what you got from cheating.]</p><br/><p>Skills were truly wondrous. The cooking skill increased a lot when using monsters as ingredients, and as it grew, it automatically leads Yu IlHan on the more correct and delicious cooking path.</p><br/><p>Of course, if he kept grilling trolls, then it would stop, but Yu IlHan had an ambitious dream to make all monsters into a dish. His final objective was a dragon steak.(E/N: Michelin star monster restaurant)</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I get to work right away after eating this?\u2026\u2026 It should be easier if a 3rd class monster appears in this dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Although I\u2019m not sure, I think that there is one.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence, so do I.\u201d</p><br/><p>A huge vortex entrance, the enormous area.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was sure that there was no way a 3rd class monster wouldn\u2019t be here in such a blatant place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe author I respect, Anton Chekhov, of Russia, said this. If a machine gun appeared in the first chapter, then Rambo must appear in the 3rd chapter with his action.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I will not tackle that line.]</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan spoke nonsense while eating troll meat, and Erta looked at him with fed up eyes.</p><br/><p>Erta seemed to lift her head up before saying while giggling.</p><br/><p>[It seems Rambo has appeared.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRambo? A 3rd class monster has appeared already?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Think about it. Was it only a machine gun you took out in this journey?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought for a while and ended up realizing.</p><br/><p>That was true. The moment he left Korea, didn\u2019t he take out pistols, submachine guns, and cannons? Amongst them, there were some who looked like they should appear in this chapter.(E/N: fourth wall)</p><br/><p>Na YuNa and her boyfriend who chattered about the Grand Canyon.</p><br/><p>The moment he thought up of that, Yu IlHan\u2019s face crumpled violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><br/><p>[They\u2019re coming this way.]</p><br/><p>Immediately after Erta said that, a truly huge scorpion showed itself over the horizon. Yu IlHan remembered seeing that thing, which moved incredibly quickly for a scorpion, not long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, why is a sand scorpion appearing on a highland!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Just save those people already!]</p><br/><p>In the left pincer of a huge sand scorpion, with a body over 4m, was the white priestess-clothed woman, Na YuNa. Yu IlHan, who was clueless to magic didn\u2019t know, but she was holding on since she cast a defensive skill over her body, as otherwise, she would be snapped in half.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s why I said to be careful!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak! Help me! I will eat my vegetables starting tomorrow so please save meeeeee!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit!</p><br/><p>A woman captured by a huge running scorpion\u2019s pincers; a guardian angel who was screaming right next to her; and lastly, an armored man who was following them. It was definitely her boyfriend.</p><br/><p>How did they even end up in that kind of situation even with a guardian angel?!? He really wanted to ignore them, but as he saw it, the situation the woman was in looked very dangerous. In truth, there was plenty of room to her defensive magic, but as Yu IlHan was clueless with magic, he wouldn\u2019t know that.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan sighed before standing up and gripped the metal skewer with troll\u2019s meat juices and blood dripping off it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are they struggling with such a weak monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If one gets ambushed then they will become like that. Although, you would never know that since you never experienced it, nor will you ever experience it in the future.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can sense hostility from your words\u2026\u2026Hup!\u201d</p><br/><p>After retorting to Erta\u2019s words while grumbling, Yu IlHan postured himself in place and threw the metal skewer like that. Erta was frightened by that scene.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re going to throw away the only chance of a surprise attack with that metal skewer!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, that\u2019s Metal Heart right there.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Are you saying that you made a mere skewer with that precious metal?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It was my dream to defeat enemies with metal skewers.\u201d(E/N: that\u2019s his next job, skewer thrower)</p><br/><p>The metal skewer that Yu IlHan threw was affected by his max level shooting skill to pierce through the air sharply like a bullet before piercing into the scorpion\u2019s pincers.</p><br/><p>As it wasn\u2019t made from Metal Heart for nothing, the metal skewer pierced such a hard carapace like tofu. It was truly an absurd scene.</p><br/><p>{Kyaaeuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!}(E/N: now imagine a chibi scorpion with the moe eyes and blush)</p><br/><p>How much would it hurt since its pincers were pierced? The huge sand scorpion momentarily couldn\u2019t endure the pain and rampaged. In that process, the woman in its pincers was freed naturally into the air.</p><br/><p>At this point, Yu IlHan realized something new, and it was that even though he had attacked first, the scorpion hadn\u2019t noticed him. It seemed that because his attack was too fast and came from an undetectable location, the passive concealment did not wear off.</p><br/><p>While thinking that he should research more into that later, Yu IlHan kicked off into the air. The scorpion was still rampaging around, and the woman was falling defenselessly in the air, so she might have been even more injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak! Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan arrived next to the woman first and grabbed one of her arms before throwing her before she even noticed that her arm was grabbed. Of course, the passing opponent was the man who was running madly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuiiiiiiiiiiiik!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the woman flew at him so suddenly, the man couldn\u2019t catch her properly. While the two were rolling on the ground after the crash, Yu IlHan kicked higher into the air and took out the death god\u2019s black spear before flinging the scorpion\u2019s head away.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[You have earned 668,938 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 78 Giant Sand Scorpion.]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit skill has become Lv 9.]</p><br/><p>Only after checking its level did Yu IlHan mutter in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Its level is quite high?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Your senses are good. Didn\u2019t I say that it was a weak opponent?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was really like that. Perhaps due to the thousand years of training, to a certain extent, he could sense how strong his enemy was.</p><br/><p>Unless it was an utterly weak enemy or a too strong enemy, he could feel that \u2018this seems doable\u2019 or \u2018this is easy\u2019 and such.</p><br/><p>With his standards, the giant sand scorpion was an opponent that he felt was easy to confront. It was actually easy to kill it as well. However, its level was quite high, so it was no wonder he was confused.</p><br/><p>However, that question was solved by Erta soon</p><br/><p>[It really was a weak opponent for you, Yu IlHan. It uses poison as its main weapon, but you have the extreme poison resistance.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the same as when he fought the shadow leopard in the past. It specialized in concealment, and as such, the rest of its ability was weak.</p><br/><p>The reason why Yu IlHan was able to kill it was also because of that.</p><br/><p>This scorpion was no different. Its abilities focused in poison so it was weak in other parts, but as its poison did not work on Yu IlHan, he could hunt it easily.</p><br/><p>After knowing the answer, Yu IlHan started dismantling it with a light heart. Of course, he didn\u2019t forget to recover the Metal Heart skewer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn ordinary sand scorpion tasted nice, so would the Giant one be even tastier?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re planning to grill it here again, aren\u2019t you!]</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was starting to dismantle the giant sand scorpion, Na YuNa, and her companion, Kang HaJin, could stand up, barely straightening themselves out.</p><br/><p>As Yu IlHan exposed his own presence strongly while severing the scorpion\u2019s life, and was now even dismantling the huge scorpion, they could not miss Yu IlHan\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s that persooooooooooooon.\u201d (T/N: if you see the end of the line lengthened, it\u2019s Na YuNa\u2019s talking)</p><br/><p>[Yes, it\u2019s that child.]</p><br/><p>When Na YuNa spoke, the guardian angel, Feyta, confirmed. After hearing them, Kang HaJin asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t now, oppa? It\u2019s the person who took out all the monsters in LA.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that armor! But he\u2019s wearing a mask instead of the helmet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool toooooo! As expected of the Dark Knight of LA!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfffft!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan coughed as he wasn\u2019t able to endure the merciless damage, while he was dismantling the scorpion with exaggerated but delicate hand movements. He really didn\u2019t want to get involved with those people, but he couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? of LA?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs Feyta said, you really do speak Korean!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa replied with a bright smile. Now that he thought about it, they were conversing in Korean! It seemed that the guardian angel Feyta told them that he was Korean anyway.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Erta was gritting her teeth, it seemed that Feyta would receive her punishment later.(E/N: Not the NSFW kind guys)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dark Knight of LA! It\u2019s all the rage on F*c*b**k.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, was that\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan muttered in shock. No way, his actions in LA has spread around on F*c*b**k? When he seemed unbelieving, Na YuNa took out her smartphone to show him. His armored figure swinging around a greatsword was really clearly depicted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are talks about you being a black knight from the American government.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome also say that you\u2019re an FBI agent.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this rate, there might be talks about him being a giant fusion robot under the Pentagon.(E/N: IlHan is secretly a Gundam) While Yu IlHan was stupefied, Erta growled while gritting her teeth.</p><br/><p>[I knew SNS was a waste of life! It\u2019s always those evil people who ruined everything! Always!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat trauma do you have with the internet to be so hostile towards it\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan dejectedly retorted to Erta\u2019s words and confronted the handsome man and pretty girl who were looking at him.</p><br/><p>There was one important thing.</p><br/><p>Chekhov\u2019s gun really did shoot.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Chekhov\u2019s gun refer to \u2018foreshadowing\u2019, and the original line is \u2018If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off.</p><br/><p>Sir Ferguson\u2019s continuous victories (T/N: No idea what this is referring to)</p><br/><p>The Chuunin examiner in Naruto was cool\u2026 (T/N: Again, no idea what this is referring to)</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Enjoy~</p><br/><p>vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv</p><br/><p>(This is the last chapter that will be posted here in NNC, starting next chapter, come to Kobatochan.com)</p><br/><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p><br/><p>Editor\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Sponsored chapter!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

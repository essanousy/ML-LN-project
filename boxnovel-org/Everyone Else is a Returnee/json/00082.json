Additionally, after the Korean military group, Suppression, revealed that they had also been supplied with custom weapons from Vanguard, the brand gained even more fame.</p><br/><p>Before this, Suppression was considered the number one contender for the most pitiful group award in Korea, but right now, they had become the luckiest people.</p><br/><p>Of course, this didn\u2019t change the fact that they would suffer for evermore, but since the level and quality of their equipment had increased drastically, injuries, much less deaths, were rarely seen anymore, even while their growth speed increased.</p><br/><p>The most reliable thing in the current world was one\u2019s own level.</p><br/><p>Suppression was levelling up at speeds not inferior to the powerful clans, despite working for the country, and even if the country or Suppression itself collapses, their levels would remain unchanged, and become their strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah, I need to capture Mr. Yu IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it up, first lieutenant Han. How about you just pick one from here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever, even if I die! Love is about winning. I will definitely win him over!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, good luck there, YeoRang Sinclair.\u201d (See Author\u2019s notes #3)</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether the Korean representative \u2018beauty\u2019 first lieutenant Han YeoRang was burning in an absurd dream, the situation in the world changed rapidly.</p><br/><p>Pregnant women, who previously went to the other worlds with swollen bellies, had all gaiven birth to their babies, and Earth now became home to the babies who were born after the Great Cataclysm, a.k.a. Newtypes, under the combined effort of governments and businesses alike, a major reconstruction of important buildings with materials that were 10 times sturdier than the existing ones began.</p><br/><p>After the Dungeon Wave in Japan, the tension surrounding the management of dungeons increased manyfold in countries all around the world, and as a result, the powerful clans acquired more opportunities to shine.</p><br/><p>In particular, the clans that were armed with higher level equipment from Vanguard greatly surpassed the growth speed of all the other clans, earning their jealousy.</p><br/><p>Some conflicts occurred due to that with clans fighting each other, but Yu IlHan put up a notice stating that anyone who stole Vanguard\u2019s weapons would not be able to acquire purchasing tickets for higher ranked weapons, which calmed them down.</p><br/><p>The opportunity wasn\u2019t over yet, we can become strong too!</p><br/><p>When the clans realized that, they became obedient. Yu IlHan could now influence all the clans in the world with Vanguard!</p><br/><p>\u201cNow this is getting me interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Why don\u2019t you stop roleplaying as the dark power and start moving?]</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s nagging made Yu IlHan obediently close the laptop and stand up. He wanted to see the situation that changed according to the notices put up in Vanguard, but this was enough for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately, we secured our place.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You thought it may fail. right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, then I would have had more work to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking back on it, the objective of Yu IlHan\u2019s founding of Vanguard was to enhance humanity. If the project collapsed due to the greed of other humans, then at that time, he would have no choice but to suffer all alone.</p><br/><p>However, fortunately, since both the standard and higher ranked equipment sales went smoothly, they would all be able to suffer nicely together! (PR: Ilhan is both an S and an M!)</p><br/><p>Under the resolve that he couldn\u2019t suffer alone, Yu IlHan made the equipments for Na YuNa and Kang HaJin of the Lightning God Clan, as well as the 25 other clans, which took him around 3 weeks.</p><br/><p>Of course, he did go and hunt some monsters in dungeons in his spare time, but after his level reached 87 due to the Orochi hunt, the rate of levelling was disgustingly slow.It almost seemed like he would be at the same level forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will I become level 100 and get my 3rd job\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[What you just said nonchalantly is a lifetime goal for countless other people in other worlds. The growth speed of the people of Earth already surpassed my imagination, but your growth speed is way too OP!]</p><br/><p>He once worried about if he couldn\u2019t wield mana before he reached level 100, but getting straight to the point, it was a needless worry.</p><br/><p>Well, it was mortifying every time he wanted to level up. If he hadn\u2019t been able to monopolize Orochi\u2019s experience, then he would still have been suffering at around level 84.</p><br/><p>[Sir Yu IlHan, we have to move now.]</p><br/><p>Said Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s consciousness. Yu IlHan also agreed with her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I have already done as much as I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was impossible for him to cover for the entire humankind, the ones standing on the front lines in the war against the monsters had definitely been strengthened thanks to Vanguard. Without exaggeration, the battle power before Vanguard and after Vanguard multiplied by around two, no, threefold.</p><br/><p>The overflowing monsters from the dungeons were being cleared out, while the Kantou region in Japan, which had shown high concentrations of mana even after the Dungeon Wave, was stabilizing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve also became more proficient in wielding mana too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You monster.]</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s words were her honest thoughts without the slightest bit of exaggeration. She couldn\u2019t believe that Yu IlHan had adapted to mana, which he had never used in his entire life, in just one month, well, 3 months including the time within the barrier.</p><br/><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t at a level where he could create an active skill by using mana, but it was plenty amazing now that he could enhance the skills he had, and use concealment freely. (T/N: \u2018enhance skills he had\u2019 can refer to superhuman strength, mana crafting and such)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no choice but to become a monster. Think about it, Erta. What did the Akashic Record ask me to do when getting my 2nd job? It was an instakill of a 3rd class monster. Then what do you think it will ask me to do for my 3rd?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t want to think about it.]</p><br/><p>[Those conditions are frightening. I also have a deathgod-category class, but I\u2019ve never gotten such stringent requirements even when I was getting my 3rd job.]</p><br/><p>Added Reta Kar\u2019iha. Just before, she didn\u2019t say such personal things, but as her thoughts became clearer and stronger by the day, it was showing changes.</p><br/><p>Why? Of course, Yu IlHan knew the answer to that, and it was because Yu IlHan had allowed her to do one thing.</p><br/><p>Which was none other than letting her devour a portion of the life force that he had acquired through Death Collector! This would have been impossible for a normal consciousness, and was possible only because she was once a deathgod.</p><br/><p>There were no skills that used the accumulated life force yet, and since Yu IlHan had hunted so many monsters already, the amount Reta Kar\u2019iha devoured really didn\u2019t make a difference, so he allowed it. However, as he saw that Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s thoughts were becoming clearer and clearer, he also thought that he may do something unbelievable in the future.</p><br/><p>And bullseye, as if she had read Yu IlHan\u2019s thoughts, Reta Kar\u2019iha spoke.</p><br/><p>[I also want to help sir Yu IlHan as soon as possible.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that. You wouldn\u2019t have eaten the life force for nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[D, do you have the power of future prediction!?]</p><br/><p>Reta Kar\u2019iha became surprised. Yu IlHan just said that it was something similar and asked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be possible with my deathgod powers, correct?\u2019</p><br/><p>[It will probably become possible when you acquire your 3rd class. There are numerous uses to life force, and not to boast, but there are even more uses for clear thoughts like me.]</p><br/><p>Erta sighed, but Yu IlHan replied with a smirk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I will be much more useful than that damned Orochi over there.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t speak of the devil. Ah! He came out there.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kroaaaaaaaar!]</p><br/><p>He thought about letting her devour the Orochi\u2019s thoughts and life force, but he stopped.</p><br/><p>As it was quite rare for a thought to be attached when absorbing life force, he felt a little too wasteful to throw away the Orochi, which was a 4th class mutant to boot, just because it was annoying. There was something else he was thinking about anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had prepared enough standard equipment to be sold in Vanguard for the foreseeable future, and the higher ranked weapons were all in his Cross Bag.</p><br/><p>He had already requested the Lightning God Clan for his parents\u2019 protection, and at the current moment, there were no signs of connections with other worlds or Overflows. At this rate, something will definitely happen, but not for now. Yu IlHan had done as much as he could.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t always move after something had happened. Before the 2nd Great Cataclysm occurred while he was hesitating, Yu IlHan decided to move.</p><br/><p>The Abandoned World, Dareu, a horrible world where the dragonkin ruled.</p><br/><p>Actually, the place where Yu IlHan could level up the quickest was also that place.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan went to the Grand Canyon again. Since the Earth had become more stabilized compared to the past, there were many tourists in the Grand Canyon, but none of them could detect Yu IlHan\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas the dungeon this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The dungeon access permission isn\u2019t coming down. Well, it can\u2019t be helped since the war in the Wall of Chaos is intensifying and all our important forces are gathered there.]</p><br/><p>The dungeon connected to Dareu within the deepest areas of the Grand Canyon was currently sealed with Heaven\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>For Yu IlHan to enter the dungeon without breaking the seal, he had to make a secret passage, or, a dog hole, but obviously, that dog hole wasn\u2019t something that could be made on a whim. It could only be done after a prior report and permission was granted.</p><br/><p>(T/N: This bit also appears in the spoilers in NUF, I mini-translated it there since this is one of my favorite parts)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will we do to come out then?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Like how we entered, we will drill another dog hole and exit. If a dragonkin slips out that hole, then that will be the start of another Dungeon Break, so we\u2019d have to close it quickly, alright?]</p><br/><p>Despite Erta\u2019s worried voice, Yu IlHan replied confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem, since it will be when I\u2019ve already killed almost all the dragons there anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Aren\u2019t you looking down on dragons? They destroyed an entire world.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you who\u2019s looking down, Erta.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta replied to Yu IlHan with a sigh, but the one who really wanted to sigh was Yu IlHan himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really not understand even after you\u2019ve experienced all those things around the world? Do you think we can come out easily once we enter?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No.]</p><br/><p>Erta knew that much. Not once did something happen according to Yu IlHan\u2019s plans.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen here.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Erta\u2019s agreement, Yu IlHan\u2019s words continued like a flowing river from the mountain; in a tone that was slightly disdainful for her to not continue thinking about it that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, we\u2019re going to go in there thinking that we are confronting them starting with the 3rd class only, but mid way, something will go wrong, and I will have to fight 4th class dragons like I\u2019m having my meals. Whether there\u2019s a problem with the magic formation of the Elf Royalties, or the dragons messing them up or whatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You mean the absolute magic formation!?]</p><br/><p>Even Reta Kar\u2019iha was shocked at Yu IlHan\u2019s daring prediction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I will be able to win against the 4th classes somehow, since I\u2019ve become stronger than that time with Orochi. I might be left in tatters every time I kill one, but I will eventually be able to win against all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re confident that you will be able to easily destroy the ones who ruined Dareu?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I probably will get my 3rd class during that process. The friendship between me and you girls might become stronger too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s originally like this.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>However, his words didn\u2019t end there.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut even after I defeat all of them, when I am about to come out after feeling relieved, a 5th class dragon, enraged at the deaths of its own kind, will come out from somewhere. That will be the finale.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Stop it, it\u2019s so likely that it\u2019s scary!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[So you really have the power of prophecy!?] (Reta)</p><br/><p>Having made an angel and a thought cower with his smooth speech, Yu IlHan was moving around the Grand Canyon looking for the dungeon, despite he himself haing predicted that horrifying future.</p><br/><p>Erta nitpicked with an exhausted voice.</p><br/><p>[But why do you looks so lively?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can just run if a 5th class appears. We can only fight him by putting together everything we have on Earth against it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You are a mere 2nd class, no, even if you acquire your 3rd as planned, how can you be so confident in running away from a higher exis\u2026\u2026 Oh, you will be able to run.]</p><br/><p>(PR: He isn\u2019t a pancosmic loner for nothing *smirk*)</p><br/><p>Erta acknowledged while she was retorting. Now that Yu IlHan was able to wield mana, if he used concealment with all his power, then even she wasn\u2019t confident in being able to find him.</p><br/><p>[Well, if you say so, then we\u2019ll just go in! Oh, the dungeon entrance was permitted just now too!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s the spirit!\u201d</p><br/><p>[What the hell is up with these people. So scary!] (Reta)</p><br/><p>The overly arrogant Yu IlHan and his friends(?) entered the dungeon connected to Dareu without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Poor Erta didn\u2019t realize that she was becoming similar to Yu IlHan in more ways than one.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>This arc is extremely long.</p><br/><p>I skipped the scene of making the spear out of the Heavenly Cloud Gathering Sword, since I wanted to make it appear in a grand fashion later, but I skipped the making of the holy weapons since I deemed it unnecessary. I thought making Kang MiRae\u2019s weapon was enough.</p><br/><p>In the novel, Demian, written by Hermann Hesse, Frau Eva, the one loved by the main character, Sinclair, once said this: \u2018I will not make a gift of myself, I must be won.\u2019 It still remains in my heart until today.</p><br/><p>Future predictor (accurate) Yu IlHan.
